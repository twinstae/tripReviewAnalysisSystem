1,1,2,Gyeongbokgung Palace,4,Pretend you're in a period K-drama,"Rent a hanbok and soak in the ancient Joseon vibes of the palace. Plus, entrance is free if you wear their traditional costume. Place was crowded though so no way you can grab any photos without a photo-bomber. Grounds can be covered in 2 to 3 hours depending on how interested you are in the place. Don't miss the changing of the guards ceremony at 10 am or 2 pm, but if you do, there's an hourly mini version of it",2019-10-01,
