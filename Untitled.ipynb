      "Minimum half of the workers don’t speak korean, especially the ones in Innisfree. I beg your pardon, but not knowing what Sale and Discount means? Why are you even working in a place with full of foreignersThere are nothing about this store for it to stand out among the numerous retail offerings in Seoul -- so why waste time? The merchandise is offered at all the better outlets at equivalent prices -- the Food Court at Doota is inferior to that of most every other store in townHad some time to browse around in the mall. The mall was okay for us. They sell what most malls in the world sell. A lot of things mostly cosmetic and perfume, bags, clothes, etc. It operates from 10am ish until 5am. Unbelievable! There is a famous restaurant next to the mall,A little disappointed with this mall. Inside was pretty crowded and selling pretty much everything including food. But for me it was more or less the same as so many other malls in Seoul selling inexpensive or gadgetry things except with lots of visitors from the mainland.  TheOpen from 10.30am till 5.00am - yes, you read it corretly - the Mall is open till 5 in the morning! I was curious who would go shopping in the middle of the night but wasn't about to lose any sleep to find out. It's about 8 levels of shopping with a Duty Free Wing next to itI suspect lots of tour buses offload their tour groups here in front of the mall which explain why this place is so packed with tourists. You can also find a food court at the basement.Just like other mall. Heaven for shopping person. They gave food court. Not many variations of food though, still in affordable price, came in a big portion. I suggest you buy 2 portions of meal for 3 person. There is Arirang shop, where sell snacks and souveniers too.Well, the best thing about Doota is their different flyers with promotions. You can get it in the street and inside the mall. Be very attentive reading it since you can get:  1. Free Face sheet mask! 2. 5,000 W (~$5) coupon for meal at their food court downstairs 3. AdditionalWe went here for a family outing because there’s a Tayo Kid’s Cafe on the 5th floor. The cafe itself was very clean and our kid enjoyed it, but it was way expensive compared to similar Kid Cafes around the city. We looked around the shops and the clothes were really cute, butThe promotion, services, membership and etc is all catered for PRC.   No point shopping here, and the cosmetic/makeup might be cheaper in the market area.  Shopping mall located inside the Doosan white building close to Dongdaemun. Food court in the basement. Shopping mall floors up to and including 6th floor. Signs say some duty free floors higher up, but I didn't go that high in building so not sure what is there. Has a coffeeI found the shop on the 6th floor of DOOTA Mall (Dongdaemun) called Arirang very rude. They sell all sorts including the 777 nail clippers which I went for.   The shopkeepers were not interested in me being present. I got the impression I got in the way. However, 10 minutesThis is a fairly large mall in the Dongdaemun district that sells a lot of clothing, food and cosmetics. The bottom few floors are offer a lot of casual clothing for both men and women with a food court located in Basement 1. There are generally a lot of Chinese tourists andNothing to spark my interest.  A very average mall lacking in “character”.  Daughter liked the kpop stationery in one of the souvenir shops, and that’s about it.This is probably the best place & the only \"bright spark\" in an otherwise uninteresting Dongdaemun. A decent nice mall with nice shops & ambience.  However, what you see here can be found in other malls in Seoul as well.   Dongdaemun isn't a very interesting place as compared toThis mall is super nice and has a huge selection especially woman's clothing. There's also a nice food court and coffee shops.   My only gripe was that it looked like a higher end Namdaemun market where they hand pick stuff from there and put them on hangers in this mall. We sawGreat for female shoppers. Cosmetics and fashion.  Lot of choice.  Open till very late. Many floors. Bring passport as it's duty freeDoota is one of the largest fashion malls at Dongdaemun Market, the fashion town that never sleeps. Home to over 3 million foreign visitors a year,  Doota is wonderful -free shopping mall and you must bring your passport.There are good deal especially for woman. The mall alsoDoota is a big mall where you can find many things there especially clothes. In the 6th floor (if I'm not wrong) there is gift shop \"Arirang\" that sells many kind of souvenir/gifts with cheap price.  You can also find Duty Free shop.This place is best seen at night with all the neon lights.  The shopping centres are pretty average and not far from the metro station.  The highlight of the trip is the big Owl and big bear!A lot of people recommended us to visit and shop at this mall but what we experienced was not as fancy as expected. The mall was big, yes, but not a great one as the others in the same area. We only spent half an hour and then decided to go to another mall.All in one shopping at Doota with a food court and tax return counter and a few floors of shops selling clothing and accessories.At the central of Dongdaemun, a very convenience place.  However, the area is too small and you have to wait the lift to and from G/F.  Means you may waste 5 minutes or more from 1/F down to G/F in critical season.I liked this mall because it houses a lot of Korea's local designers.It's also very near Dongdaemun station so you won't have a hard time locating it.The brands in this mall are quite expensive but if you like unique clothes and other goods by Korean labels then this one's forI used to love shopping at Doota 7-8 years ago but this trip was shocked with the prices.   I saw prices ranged from 46,000 Won to 600,000 Won where as other shopping centre nearby were selling fashion that much cheaper than that perhaps ranged from 9,000 Won - 58,000 Won. To beAs it is cashing into tourist's, hard to evaluate the credibility of the quality, clearly prices at mid high range, it takes one to recognize the worthy of it. I've heard a lot about Doota mall and I might expect a lot but the clothes is the same the price is kind of expensive compared to the quality of the other store. The good thing about it is that it open up to the midnight and until 5 amThe items sold here are very expensive.. Took a walk around in the mall but did not manage to buy anything. Unless you are into designers items and willing to spend that much amount of money, I think it is not really suitable for normal shopping with items of reasonable price.I won't buy anything in Doota- it has grown into a landmark but everything in Dongdaemun is more expensive than elsewhere. It is just a building with endless shops and overly priced clothes.....I rather prefer other places than here. Walked through since I was there- just toTotally gentrified thus expensive. I'm not sure if there's a significant difference in quality between the designer clothes of Doota and the other Korean brands that you can find in Myeongdong or even in small shops at the subway stations. Not convinced and not amused, not even\n"
