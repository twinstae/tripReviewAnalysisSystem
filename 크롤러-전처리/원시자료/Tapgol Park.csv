2,3.0,Nice Little Park,"I decided to visit this park as it is near my hotel. For all its rich historical significance, it is also a nice, small park from which to take a breather and quiet walk in the heart of the city.

A 15th century 10-story pagoda is encased in glass but it’s not easy to get a great picture of. There are also monuments that signify Korea’s Declaration of Independence from Japan in 1919.Evaluation: It’s a very small park. I spent about 30 minutes here and that was enough. Many older men come here to relax. If you’re going to Insadong, you can stop here since it’s close to there. If not, you don’t need to bother. Location: Jongno-3-ga Station, Exit 1", August 2018

15,3.0,Quiet little park. With several ancient monuments. Worth it if you're a culture buff. ,"It's very near our hotel so we decided to pop there on the last day. It's quite interesting but mostly local old men linger in this area. The monuments here are really from the ancient times unlike some which are replicas. Quite intriguing. The stone pagoda was the same one seen in some old photos at the museum. In the past that was the tallest building in the area, now it's well surpassed by skyscrapers. The park is at the end of the insadong street, so you can easily continue to walk and stroll up insadong if you come from jongno3ga station to the park and link up to insadong street. Easy walk.

There are several large sculptured plaques on the wall that surrounds the park inside.  They are all about the war with the Japanese.  It shows the beginning and the end.

19,4.0,Quiet Park with Importance,"I took a walk through this park because we had visited the Prison in the morning and learned how pivotal this park was in Korea's drive for independence. When you enter the park you are able to view a map to orient yourself.  In reality you don't need it as the park is quiet and compact and filled with ordinary people relaxing under the trees.

There are few Statues and Monuments in the park including the famous “10 Storied Stone Pagoda” which was covered by a huge protective glass case.

27,4.0,Remarkable important place.,"It is an amazing place. When this park was created in 1913 it was the first Western style park in Korea. Prior to that it was the site of Buddhist temple. The towering Joseon Pagoda now protected from weather elements comes from 15th century. The proclamation of Korean independence from Japanese rule in March 1919 took place here. This little park is loaded with history!Nowadays it is also a spot where peaceful elderly gentlemen sit on benches and socialize.The best way to visit the Topgol Park is to first walk the perimeter and look at the stellas on the walls of the park. The relieves depict dramatic historic events in allegorical way. This is a very special place for anybody interested in Korean history. The ""exhibit"" culminates in the form of the Monument of Declaration of Korean Independence and in accompanying statues.Topgol park is south of Insadong.", October 2015

29,2.0,Full of old men sitting around,Found it uncomfortable here - only place in Seoul I did.  Full of old men sitting around.

33,3.0,Small park with a nice pagoda,"There is nothing much in this park aside from the interesting Wongaksa Pagoda and Monument of Wongaksa stele.  As a temple hunter, I enjoyed it, but it doesn't have a lot to occupy you for a long time.  Worth seeing if you are visiting Insa-dong", March 2015

35,2.0,Very Small Park,"Some of the reviews here have made this park larger than it actually seems. It's very small, and apart from the old pagoda and murals, there's really nothing much else to see. We were here just to get the bus to Nami Island (the stop faces the Starbucks cafe across the street). For those here because they are thinking about how to get to Nami, I would recommend asking your hotels to make advance reservations with the official Nami Island operator. We did so with The Westin, who assured that we had seats for the trip. Many others came and joined the queue to try their luck, but from what I saw a good 70-80% of the seats were pre-reserved, leaving many others without a ticket.", November 2014
36,3.0,Interesting place,"Chanced upon this place when I was in Insodong area. There's a really old pagoda in this park, and quite a number of stone murals depicting some wartime history, though I didn't notice any English explanation around.

37,3.0,Interesting History in a small park.,"We came across this park by accident and although there is not a lot to see, the Ten Storied Stone Pagoda of Wongaska Temple is quite amazing. This is actually the historic site where 33 representatives the march 1st Movement of 1919 recited the Korean Declaration of Independence from Japan. We were there at the time of the celebrations for Buddha's Birthday so there were hundred of lanterns around the trees - very colourful. The park is small, tranquil  and relaxing.", April 2014
38,4.0,Small but Historical.,Not a must-see but if you are in the area it is definitely worth a visit. This pagoda is one of the oldest in Korea and is very well preserved. There isn't a lot else to see in the park but if you are nearby it is quiet place to relax and see a little history., April 2013
39,3.0,"Small, far less interesting than so many other places in Seoul",This small park amidst the modern buildings is nice but there are many more interesting ones in Seoul. The 10-story pagoda encased in glass is beautiful but hard to admire due to the structure that protects it. If you walk by take a look but otherwise it is not worth a detour., January 2014
40,4.0,Nice park in the city,Tapgol Park is a nice enclosed park to rest & you can also see the Pagoda encased in a glass construction. There is a few places to sit & relax to escape the hustle & bustle of the city, September 2013
41,4.0,for some peace and quiet.,"While I was in Seoul, I didn't see a lot of old people. So I was surprised when I went to Tapgol Park.  A lot of elderly Koreans like to hangout here. However small it is, history actually happened here. This is a small park where you'll find the glass enclosed pagoda. It's also more relaxed and quiet here, a place to rest. It would be a shame to not drop by the park if you are already going to Insadong.", September 2012
42,4.0,Beauty in a strange place,"I thought this park was very peaceful and lovely. It was a place of relaxation and was very calming. I loved that it was so quite in that place and I saw many couples just walking along together. Some of the imagery is heart wrenching and even if you are not Korean you can understand the pain of the people that were portrayed. No it is not a huge park, but with all the trees and left over parts of the temple it is a very calming place. I only gave it 4 marks due to how many homeless people were there. I think if you are into historical things or if you just enjoy walking around with lots of trees then you should definitely go.", June 2013
43,2.0,Nothing worth seeing actually,Small park with an old tomb and a statue with lots of old men sitting around and also homeless ppl. I will not recommend to go there purposely to see this park., June 2013
44,5.0,"Fascinating, safe place","My first venture to the park was accidental, and magical.  I got off the subway and started walking.  Older men sat throughout the park playing a board game with black and white markers.  Restaurant owners had big flat pans of salted cabbage (for making KimChi) just sitting on the sidewalk, and jewelers were in shops all around doing traditional knotting.  I am 63, and several old men came up to me and asked, in English if I was American.  When I said yes they each then proceeded to thank me for the contribution the US made to help Koreans in the war.  Very touching.  I had a friend visit from the states, took her there, and she had the same experience.  I think Americans always have to remember they are in a foreign country, and to use common sense about walking alone at night.  This park, tho, is not to be missed.", February 2012
45,4.0,Visit for the Early Joseon Marble Pagoda,"Like other visitors have mentioned the park is primarily used by the elderly. The park is very small, but once you see the large glass structure, walk toward it, and you will surely appreciate a short visit to Tapgol park. The pagoda was constructed in 1467 and it is an incredible work of art. It's twin is located in the National Museum of Korea. Walking around the glass structure for 10 minutes is worth your time, the park doesn't offer any other attractions except for being the location of the March 1st movement in 1919. I give this site 4 stars because of the pagoda, don't expect much else, 15 minutes will be plenty of time.", August 2012
46,3.0,Small but nice,"A good place to rest a bit after walking around in the palaces or in Insadong. The park is quite small, but it protects a historical heritage. It's like a peace haven in the city.", August 2012
