0,4.0,Seafooddddd!!!!,"So many choices!!! It feels so asian when you arrive because of all the owners convincing you to buy at their stall! You have to bargain for a good price and afterwards a lady escorts you to their restaurant where they prepare the fish and seafood you just bought! Steamed,", January 2020
1,4.0,For seafood lovers,"the location was about 0.5 km from the exit of the Noryangjin metro station. Just walk to straight ahead from the right of the exit and you'll find a signage to the market via a tunnel/underground pass. The price of seafood as expected are the most expensive during winter but the seller will usually add some free seafood together with what you bought. I think the stall has its own pre-assigned restaurants to cook your seafood, hence it is easier to buy all you wanted to be cooked from the same stall/seller. Easier to negotiate price as well. The restaurant is in the second floor but i found that the price to cook is quite expensive based on what i paid recently (it was mostly either plain barbeque/ simple spicy dish). Maybe you'll find it cheaper at other restaurant. There are shop selling meat as well and the price of wagyu beef is quite cheap (of course not halal). Most seafood sold are fresh and some are still alive.", January 2020
2,5.0,Amazing,"If you are a fisherman or seafood lover, this place is amazing. The variety of love seafood is unbelievable.  Very clean and unique. Largest prawns I ever saw. Upstairs Resturants will prepare what you buy but did not try this. Others say it was very expensive. Suggest negotiating before purchase.", January 2020

4,5.0,Seafoods - from tanks to tables,"I have seen similar places in Singapore, Hong Kong and elsewhere, but this is top on the list if you are interested in live seafood (or sea creatures) - from tank to table. Not pleasant sight for vegetarians - be warned. Highly recommended are crabs and cuttlefish. You would also struggle to find bigger and fresher tuna elsewhere. Donâ€™t expect however to find live prawns (though they are common in HK and Spore). Price is reasonable - perhaps 20-30% below HK and Spore prices - Apple with Apple comparisons.", December 2019

6,5.0,"Unique experience, a must for foodies","It's nowhere near as exotic or hectic as Tsukiji in Tokyo but it's fun buying the fresh fish and having it prepared to your liking at the market. Grilled turbot and sashimi - yum! The fact that nobody speaks English makes it even more fun - we had to use hand gestures, Google Translate, calculators - to communicate what we wanted.", November 2019
7,3.0,Good experience but pricey,, November 2019
8,4.0,Varieties of Seafood!,"My Daughter and I walked around the market being wowed by the different varieties of seafood but to avoid the hassle of haggling to buy and paying the preparation fees, we opted to go directly in one of the restaurant upstairs. We choose a restaurant that served a course menu of Korean style sashimi with 14 dishes. I would say, the food was average when it comes to taste but but the squirming chopped live octopus was definitely an amazing and unique experience.", September 2019
9,5.0,Best place to get seafood in Seoul,"The best place to get seafood in Seoul. The fish stall are linked to the restaurant, so Khuan need to select and they will cook for you. A bit pricey but the king crab is worth the price. A heartfelt meal for the whole family.", November 2019

The lady selling us the seafood was extremely friendly but the guy was quite arrogant! She also brought us to a small restaurant on another floor to prepare the seafood for us. The food preparation was fine but the charges just for the cooking was expensive. Overall, not really worth it.", November 2019

18,5.0,Pricy but the experience is worth it!,"We went there after all what we heard and read about that place! We really enjoyed the evening! The food is super fresh and tasty. Picking such fresh fish isn't something you can do in many places around the world! Yes, it was pricy and yes they charge foreigners more and yes you have to negotiate the price but isn't this part of the fun ðŸ˜Š", October 2019

20,4.0,Lunch at the fish market is pricy,"As many of you have probably read in other reviews you buy seafood from one of the vendors on the main floor. Then you're brought up to the 2nd floor where they take you to a restaurant where they cook the food for you. I bought a king crab (price is by weight) and an order of prawns which came 5 in an order. That cost me KRW 60,000 which is about $50. I thought that would be it but when I went to pay the restaurant charged ME another approximately KRW 30,000 as a service fee for cooking the food. All in with a beer cost me about USD $90 or fractional more. The food was fresh and good but I wasn't prepared to spend that much. Oh well you live and learn.", October 2019
21,5.0,Must visit,Come here and view an auction or just walk around looking at the different selection. There are a couple of restaurants on the 2nd floor that will cook you any of the fish you buy. Food was fantastic and the experience was well worth the time, September 2019
22,1.0,Overpriced,"This is the first time Iâ€™ve brought my parents along, and this isnâ€™t my first time here, was pretty excited as my parents love to have seafood. We had fun selecting our seafood with reasonable price but the nightmare started when we finished our dinner and was going to pay our bills. Couldnâ€™t believe my own eyes how much it costed us. We had 4 seafood, 3 out of 4 dishes was steam, we only had our crabs stir fried, yet the bill was exorbitant. Our seafood costed 56000won with a fish, 4 abalone, 2 crabs and 8 prawns. The bill for dinning in the restaurant was 71000won.", September 2019
23,5.0,Highlight to Our Trip to Seoul,This isn't a place to save money. It is an experience that is so memorible and delectable it has to enjoyed. My 3 children and niece were mesmerized by all the edible sea creatures for over an hour. When we finally chose our dishes they were prepared upstairs... sushi downstairs (where my hawk of a mother-in-law made sure we got the freshest selection) My five year old had sea cucumber and enjoyed it. I will remember that taste for a long time., July 2019
24,5.0,Fascinating ,, August 2019
25,3.0,Lots of seafood,"We spent about $400 worth of seafood. Great price, but when added the cooking fees, it was not really a good deal at all. However, seafood tasted fresh and really good.. Recommended to visit and maybe spend less $. Must bargain all the times.", July 2019

27,4.0,Interesting offerings,"Though not a ""fish person,"" I truly enjoyed visiting this market which offers numerous varieties of seafood not readily found in the US. There were huge shrimp/prawns/scallops, even larger crabs and lobsters, and vendors nimbly climbing on the tanks to retrieve product. We did not elect to eat at the market, but if one didn't want to ""chance"" a cooked-to-order overcharge, they could opt for a wide variety of offerings from the restaurants on the second floor.", June 2019
28,3.0,To Experience it.,"This place is in my itinerary for Seoul trip. Just wanted to experience the fish market in Korea. We took public transportation to get there and venture into the market. The 1st floor (ground floor) is dedicated for seafood heaven. All sort of fresh seafood selling here. Know how to bargain, know which seller will give you their best price. Usually people will buy the seafood here and will go upstairs to the restaurant for them to cook it. Well,we did not do that as we rather cook it ourselves at the place we were staying. So, in our bags we have prawns, scallops, cockerels, fishes, squids. Upstairs,  on the 2nd floor you have the restaurants, more seafood vendors, meat section and dried section. We even bought some anchovies and dried shrimps. All set with heavy bag, we head on to the subway, heading back to our place. Overall, it was pretty interesting to experience the market, interesting vendors, friendly and we really enjoyed it. Beside the seafood are indeed fresh.", June 2019
29,1.0,Avoid !!!!,"We were charged abt 250000 won for cooking service whereas our seafood is around 320000 won.. the cooking service was overchargedâ€¦ Will never go again n will not recommend tooâ€¦ In total , one meal we spend Singapore dollars 600 plus.. for one king crab, 6 scallops, 6 abalone, half steam fish, a piece of bbq salmon, 2 octopus fried with vegetable, one dish of vegetables, one fried rice, 4 pcs of sea urchin, small plate of shading octopus, one plate of fried prawns . 6 adults one kid â€¦", June 2019
30,3.0,Biggest Fish Market in Seoul (i guess),"the place is well maintained although the elevator has a stinky, fishy smell when we went there. Lots of fresh seafoods inside the aquariums for you to choose.just let the ""on-site Cooks"" know ahead of time to not overcook your seafood 'coz they have a tendency to do this.If you're looking for the live raw octupus to eat, this place has it. they sell baby octupus that even when chopped alive, the poor creature still moves and has the suctioning parts", June 2019

33,1.0,Seafood Trip.....Regretted!,"Overrated and not worth at all. The seller keep pushing for you to buy from them. Once bought, the restaurant upstairs not bothered to entertain you as I am going with my family , total 4 persons. Finally got a place, after 3 restaurants rejected us as they are expecting more crowds/ table during meal hours. Then the seat and the cooking fee they charge is more expensive than the seafood we bought! Never again will I go to Noryanjin Market, ever.", February 2019
34,1.0,Sitting charged and cooking fees,"The minutes you walked into the fish market. They approach you quickly n very aggressive into buying crab, fish, clam, octopus and etc. We paid $140 for the smaller crab, halibut and some clams. What pissed me off is upstairs restaurant over charged us for sitting and cooking fees included the soup $130.00. Not very honest peoples and wrong way of doing business. Never again..", April 2019
35,1.0,Stay Away!!  ,"Hmmm...family comes here w high hopes of having fresh fish.  The place is absolutely not tourist friendly.  If you donâ€™t speak korean then youâ€™re out of luck.  Instead you get duped into the hands of a racketeer.  A lady and this man on the corner beg us to buy fish.  The man says that this lady owns a restaurant.  Have no idea whether having a connection to a restaurant owner is a must to eat there because I donâ€™t speak Korean.  So I give into this ploy, buy the fish (30,000 won for a flavorless flat fish slippery-tasting fish that he kept pushing on us, along with a meager portion of salmon and tuna thrown which we had requested) and off we go into this restaurant that the lady leads us to.  The idea is that they would bring the fish to us filleted.   We get side dishes (lettuce leaves and darn-jahng) brought to us and we buy some battered shrimp and fish there.  When we get done we are waved down saying we owe money.  What?  We paid for the fish and the tempura.  What would we owe?  They charged us for not having ordered the soupâ€”try 5,000 won per person so 20,000 won.  Itâ€™s ridiculous.  Oh and if the story canâ€™t get any worse, my husband gets sick from the food.  Yep, upchuck on our trip to Korea.  They should take the license away from these swindlers and make them slough dead skin off of people.  Stay away.  Trust me.  Itâ€™s not worth it.", April 2019

44,3.0,Great experience for photo taking but not food,"plenty of seafood to sea in a market, but wasn't really please with the restaurant. Note that the purchase price of seafood and to cook it is a separate cost altogether. Nothing fantastic about the style of cooking so its probably just worth going there for the experience", January 2019
45,4.0,Fun to shop around and then eat what you buy,"You really shouldn't fault the hawkers for doing their job - hawk all that fresh seafood! And the fun is in the banter in broken korean and english with them and if you are keen to eat the freshest and most diverse, then you should try it out. And there will always be a another keen restauranter who would be keen to help you cook and prepare what you have bought. For us, it was fun, and plentiful of good tasty pescetarian delights!", January 2019
46,4.0,Yummy seafood Good eats Worth the Stop,, December 2018
47,1.0,Definitely a NO to Noryangjin Market,"The sea products varieties are there. But the hawker are pushing you to buy the king crap or other prized product. Once you bought and you go to 2nd floor to the restaurant, the same attitude is reflecting. They will look at what you have purchased. If you buy too little seafood, they will chase you away or ignore you. Personally for my experience, I have bought abalone, shells, squids and salmon fish and after bargain, only we can eat in one of the restaurant. And the charges of the cooking services(plus the seating place) is much more expensive than the sea product that i bought. Never again will I be back.", December 2018
48,1.0,Not worth going,"The fish market is quite big and easy to go by train but we think can skip this place. We have a bad experience and impression of Korea on the second day of our trip. A lot variety of fresh seafood. The price of fresh seafood is ok but of course have to bargain but this is just the beginning. The worker/owner of the seafood stall will keep following and ask us to go to their restaurant. They don't cook seafood the way you want even we told them to. The cooking fees shown on board of the shop - KRW3,000 per person without soup and KRW5,000 per person with soup. Be cautious, they still overcharged us. The amount of seafood we bought is KRW65,000 but the cooking fees we paid is KRW79,000 whereby no soup and just steam all our seafood. How come they steam our oysters. We want to eat it fresh. We also noticed they only serve soup to Korea citizen and no soup to tourist. When we ask how they got the amount charged for cooking fees, they don't even bother to answer us. This really caused a bad impression for Korea tourism. Hope no one will be the next victims like us. Don't visit the restaurant No. 4.", November 2018
49,1.0,Boring market,It's just another fish market and nothing special about it. Some stall sellers will approach you but I think they are mostly China Chinese. I doubt the price will be good. I think you can spend half an hour there just to get a feel of the place., December 2018
50,4.0,Noryangjin Fish Market,, December 2018
51,2.0,Underwhelmed with the new fish market,"The old and the new fish market are right next to each other. Initially we walked through the old one first from the subway to get to the new one. I had learnt that some vendors decided to not move to the new building, so the new fish market was quite awkwardly empty in such a huge space.", November 2018

54,3.0,"Average seafood, very touristy and pushy in sales.","The seafood in this place is not of the best quality. Stall owners there learn Chinese to sell to mainland tourists. Extremely pushy in sales, will follow you all the day and hold you to bring you to their restaurants. It's unique that they cook seafood for you in the way you prefer after purchasing it fresh. The live octopus is also unique to Noryangjin / Korea (haven't actually tried this anywhere else!)", July 2018
55,4.0,Itâ€™s worth the experience!,"We reached Noryangjin Fish Market via subway, stopped at Noryangjin station, walked out at exit 7. About 50m, enter the tunnel on your right and there are signs leading the way to the market. It took us couple of minutes. First stall we approached was stall number 28. Quote for King crab was 39,000 won per kg. Itâ€™s much cheaper than what we read on tripadvisors so we didnâ€™t explore other stalls. We bought a 2.5kg King crab, 3 abalones for 10,000won and 5 big size prawns for 10,000won for 3 of us. Happy with our purchase we were led upstairs to the restaurant to prepare our food.  We had the King crab steamed, prawns and abalones grilled. King crab meat was so fresh, tender and sweet. Food preparation came to 45,000won, not cheap. Unless you are willing to go from restaurant to restaurant to compare the food preparation, I would suggest just factor in the preparation price into the seafood price. 165,000 won was really worth it especially for such a huge King Crab.", November 2018

Donâ€™t stop at the first place that speaks English. Once you settle on something, start talking. Itâ€™s all right to point, then gawk, then walk away if you want. If you pick a live fish, they will kill it there. If you want it sashimi style, they will cut it up. Pay for the fish. Then, go with a man who appears from nowhere and takes you upstairs. Donâ€™t ask questions. He will drop you in a restaurant. Tell them how you want the fish cooked. Sit down. Drink. Cooked fish will appear. Eat. Drink some more. Pay as you leave. Thank me later.", August 2018
74,5.0,Very interesting! Tourist-friendly place!,There are two separated parts in the Noryangjin Fish Market: the old marked and the new marked. The first one looks like the old traditional market while the second one is a very new and modern market where the tourist can roam around and discover different types of fishes and seafood. The best thing is that you can buy your own fresh seafood and fish at the ground floor and then carry them to the first floor where there are lot of restaurants that cook them for you in a very reasonable price., September 2017

77,2.0,Interesting place. One time visit only,"I went on a culinary adventure to Noryangjin as some of them wanted to try eating live octopus. The place was easy to find and the market is certainly an interesting place to visit. Itâ€™s amazing how much seafood is harvested and eaten by humans :) I feel like we were ripped off though. We purchased a piece of tuna from the fish display and took it to one of the restaurants on the 2nd floor. Many of us think that they might have swapped our tuna for a different piece while it was being cooked. The piece we purchased was very non uniform and the one we received looked just like a well cut piece. This concern aside, the food was ok (not amazing) and the experience wonâ€™t be the same in a 2nd visit. IMHO a place for a single visit. Be careful with people and watch your fish as it may be swapped on you too.", August 2018

81,5.0,No trip to Seoul is complete without visiting the fish market,"There is an old building and a new building next to each other. We first walked round the old building which is just one level and saw all kinds of seafood products, many of them still alive. Afterwards we entered the new 3 storey building and saw more of the same. The market sells about 150 tons of seafood a day. You van purchase the seafood from the vendors and take it upstairs to the restaurants who will cook it the way you want and add side dishes (for a price). There is also an area where they sell dried marine products but the whole fish market was one of the highlights in Seoul.", July 2018

Was told that restaurant will charge 3k won (restaurant asked for 5k during billing, and we told them we was told 3k before we came up)per pax for cook services, but in actual there some hidden cost associated with each dishes. The 3k is only cover the king crab, cooking scallop and the rest all need extra k. End up the cook services we paid for is equal to the stuff we bought. (Mean total cost became double). We got our stuff at the new market which is just next to the old one. Donâ€™t be hurry to get your stuff, walk and ask around. Ask each itemâ€™s cook service.

Stall owners were all ferocious Chinese ladies and when i tried to bargain a little (I'm not even someone good at bargaining), they shouted and told me to get lost.

We simply went to the restaurant and waited for our food. We tried the uncooked sea intestine and octopus (i.e. sashimi). It was excitied and funny that you could feel the octopus moving in your throat. The chef just added sesame oil and salt on the sea intestine and octopus but it was superb tasty.

125,4.0,Good experience in Seoul....,"It is a  fish market in a huge complex (several floors) housing more than few thousands shops.  You can get everything which lives in water.  You can bye and take the stuff on the top floor which is lined with several restaurants.  They will cook for you for some charges.  So, visit during lunch or dinner.  And if you want to see the actual local flavor, visit the market early morning (1.00 a.m.) when auction is held.  Metro: Noryangjin (Line 1) exit 1 or 8 (not far from Seoul Railway Station).", October 2017
126,2.0,"Used to love the old market, dislike the new characterless and expensive market",This is our second visit after 3 years. All I can say is the new market is a total disappointment. Characterless and lots of foreigners selling IMPORTED(so much more salmon being sold and prawns from south east Asia for example) expensive seafood. As the number of stalls have increased I see that most of the live seafood is not as fresh ie most are oxygen starved in crowded tanks. At the restaurants it is all about $. No longer a great local experience this has become just another place to eat expensive seafood especially if you dont speak the language., December 2017
127,5.0,New experience in seeking seafood cuisine,"Eating at Noryangjin is not a novelty. I have been to many countries that do the same. But still there is something special about the place. How is how it works. Go look for the food (fresh) in the market. Pick the food you and at the price you want to pay. The seller will accompany you to the row of restaurant that will be so willing to cook it for you. Here is the difference. The variety span from huge snow crabs to oysters. Everything fresh (and moving). My kid was thrilled by the octopus. The sellers do allow him to play with the creature. The best of the whole buying experience is, you can pay by your credit card! Prices are very reasonable. I got the whole snow crab, abalone, sea cucumber, octopus, scallops for US$138. Have that cooked add the fried rice mixed into the crab shell, a hotpot soup and throw in a couple of drinks for another US$78. Total damage for a feast slightly over $200 that can feed 3-4 persons.", November 2017

A varied experience . Never thought of visiting a fish market especially in a different country since my country is full of markets and fishes..., October 2017
132,5.0,Cheap place for seafood,A must visit if you are a seafood lover. But take note that there are the original old fish market and the new fish market (a newer building) just next to the old one. The price at the old market is definitely much more cheaper (about half price) as compared to the new market. Order whatever seafood u like from the stall and the ahjuma will call their restaurant contact to bring you to have the seafood cook and eat at the restaurant. Walk around to compare the price but majority of them sell the same things and you can bargain abit for better pricing., November 2017
133,3.0,Just okay...,"This place was just okay. We checked out both the old market and the new market. Definitely the place to go to if you want live fish or crabs but I noticed most of their shrimp were frozen. Came for the live squid sashimi but you can also get that the Gwangjang market and would not have to travel far. Wished we had a Korean speaker with us as most of the vendors donâ€™t speak English. Overall, probably not a place I would go to again.", November 2017
134,4.0,Smelly great place,"It's smelly, fishy, but if you want a fresh yummy seafood then this is the place to go.

Big, loud, usually crowded, get there early in the morning for the best deals.", February 2017
135,5.0,Fresh live seafood experience!,There are many seafood vendors to choose from and restaurants upstairs to cook your food.  There are comments about this place being expensive.  Yes....you are not going to get a live king crab for $50 here.  But it still will be a bargain compared to what you pay in the US.  Also if you are spending some big cash don't be afraid to ask for some free extras for the vendors.   Overall I would highly recommend coming here at least once for the experience and to get some super fresh seafood., June 2017

Once you have picked them, you could bring them to the restaurants to cook for a fee. And so we walked around to pick some seafood, when up to a restaurant recommended by one of the seafood counter-owners. The different seafood we bought were obviously ok because they were all fresh, and we actually had lobster sashimi for breakfast!

157,3.0,Very expensive,"This place is more for locals or tourists with a local guide. It's a typical wet fish market. Most of the seafood are still alive. I had to walk for quite sometime before a gentleman greeted me in English. Apparently, he speaks Mandarin too. So, lucky for us. He explained that I had to choose my seafood from his stall and then follow a lady to a restaurant where the seafood will be cooked and prepared. You have to pay the fish monger for the seafood and pay the restaurant for their service separately. There are a few restaurants so if you're picky, you might want to check out the restaurants first. The price was rather steep but we got to sit with the locals, on the floor, in the restaurant.", June 2017
158,4.0,Fresh Seafood you must try,"It is a must go place for me as I love fresh salmon sashimi and it's my dream to try the king crab at least once in my lifetime. There's alot of things that you need to take note before going here. Your ability to speak basic Korean can determine whether you love or hate the experience. Bargain hard, it's your right! If they refuse to give discounts, ask for service, they might throw in some prawns or octopus for you :) Do not just buy from the first stall you see, explore around and find one with a good deal. Another important note, if you plan to dine here, there will be extra charges from the restaurant and this may vary in prices. So, ask their charges first before even agreeing to enter their restaurant. I will be going back again this year!", December 2016

There are dozens of stalls each with tanks of live seafood - it is fascinating just walking from stall to stall and looking at the seafood. I was lucky to come with a local Korean so language is no barrier. The lobster and crab were huge - but for two of us, we selected abalones, clams and a fish. The fish was prepared 3 ways - Sashimi, grilled and the bones used as delicious fish soup. The abalone was grilled with butter while the clams were steamed. It was absolutely delicious.

The new one was just next to it - much better environment, not sure why they don't move all vendors. We bought live octopus, King Crab, Abalone, shrimp, uni and clams.

Go around most of the stalls at least once before started the conversation with the sellers and until you found the one has all of seafood type you want.  The sellers started with a higher price, there's  room for negotiation if you purchased all your seafood in one stall.  Each stall works with a restaurant who will cook the seafood for you.

Our tour guide told us honestly that the seafood was expensive and it would have been cheaper to order seafood from a restaurant. Everyone was selling about the same thing.

Tough, if you are not a seafood or market lover, i would not recommend the visit as there are no other sights nearby. My korean Mum bought a fish that the fishmonger prepared as sashimi to eat at home (and some beef for me from another shop !) You should not expect some cheap prices because it is a large wholesale market if you buy as private.

Once you enter, it is quite likely that a local would start following and helping you to communicate with the sellers. This local would be an employee from one of the restaurants on the second level who would bring you to his restaurant subsequently where they will help cook the seafood which you have bought. Although the final cost is pricey, the seafood is indeed fresh. If you don't mind skipping the experience of the market, I would suggest just going straight to a well-known seafood restaurant in the city as the price point would be similar.", May 2017
