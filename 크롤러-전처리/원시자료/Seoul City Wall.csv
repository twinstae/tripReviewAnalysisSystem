0,4.0,Hanyangdoseong,Hanyangdoseong was built to safeguard Hanyang (Seoul) in Joseon dynasty. It was guarding the city for more than 500 years. Worth a visit., October 2019
1,4.0,Good Excursion for your Legs,Came here from Ihwa Mural Village on my way to Dongdaemun by foot. I was there almost towards the end of sunset and it was beautiful. Got a good exercise climbing up to one of the spot to take photos and it reminded me of the last scene of K-drama Memories of Alhambra~ :), September 2019
2,4.0,Excellent walk to see Seoul,Visited the Naksan to Dongdaemun section of the wall. The views were amazing and we were able to see a quieter side of Seoul. this section is an easy walk suitable for people of all ages., November 2019
3,3.0,it's a toss up,"because of the obsessively stubborn cultural korean way, you may regret going in this 'excursion' if having small children; once you start your walk on the perimeter, they won't let you out & also even check your passport at some point when going by the blue house (the korean white house)..", April 2019
4,5.0,really good,Did a fair bit of the walk and found it really good and as you walk higher up you get great views.  You will find nice little cafes and viewing points for great photos., October 2019
5,4.0,Nice to explore around,"Take the subway to Dongdaemun station and you will see the Southern Gate and the wall. It is part of the wall that surrounds the whole ancient city around Seoul. There are local stores and roadside peddlers selling local food and products. Stop by and try their local odeng (fishcake in clear soup), topokki (rice cakes in slightly spicy gravy), local sausages, which seems to be available everywhere. Nearby you can see the the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (like a structure from a Star Trek movie) and various shopping malls including duty free malls (without the tobacco and liquor).", November 2019
6,4.0,Steep hike to breathtaking views,"Attempted to reconnect with nature with a hike to Seoul city wall after a work trip, the path up was made easier with the cold of winter. Superb view of Seoul city from the TOP!", December 2019
7,5.0,A Highlight!,There are many sections of the city wall to follow. I chose the portion leading up Mt. Namsan to the N.Seoul Tower in Namsan Park. It was a section of about 500m beyond the cable car station and traversed a beautiful idyllic forest with the momiji autumn leaf colour change. An altogether peaceful setting. Viewing platforms allow better views of the city sections and former defenses., November 2019
8,4.0,"Not the Great Wall, but nice views of the city","Recommend going in the evening, as the city views are nice and the gate across the street is lit up nicely.", November 2019
9,5.0,Beautiful piece of old Seoul in the heart of an ultra modern city ,Right in the heart of Dongdaemun is this piece of of history that you must check out. It's a two minute climb up from near Heunginjimun gate. The view from up here is amazing. For the best experience go up before the sun sets and watch the lights of the city come on from up there., November 2019
10,5.0,Great outing!,"We spent a day walking one section of the Seoul City Wall.  Public transport to the Changuimum Gate was easy and straightforward and there were a couple of sweet little cafes near the gate, so we stopped for lunch and coffee.  Once we started walking, it was up, up, up to a point with lovely views of the city.  The only downside of this section was that it abuts a military base so photography was prohibited.  Overall, though, it was a sweet way to spend a few hours, taking in the sights and the beautiful autumn leaves!", October 2019
11,4.0,Picturesque,"Another must visit, allows for some cool photo souvenirs and is a real piece of the city’s vast history. I enjoyed my time there, though I wouldn’t spend hours. It’s close to Dongdaemun square, so can be combined with other activities...", November 2019
12,4.0,By the Dongdaemun shopping area check out the old city wall,"There is a section of Seoul's old city wall in the Dongdaemun area. It looks interesting and is good for a photo (or several), you can walk beside it and in places climb along the wall rampart however its not really safe or set up for it. Other walls say at Suwon can be safely walked.  It's worth a look if you are in the area.", October 2019
13,5.0,Part of history,Take a leisurely stroll along the wall to feel the spirit of the old days. Above is a nice view of the city., September 2019

15,4.0,The East Gate wall is one of the best,"For the full experience visit the Heunginjimun Gate (the East Gate), then the Seoul City Wall Museum, then walk up the high side of the City Wall about 1 kilometre to the Ihwa-dong Village and return on the lower side of the wall to the East Gate for the full experience.The wall was first built by King Taejo during his fifth year of reign (1398). It was destroyed during the Japanese occupation of Korea between 1910 - 1945 and was rebuilt in the 1970s as a symbolic gesture after a commando raid from North Korea was foiled on 21 January 1968. The views from all points as you climb are spectacular. From the low point, the East Gate, from the middle Dongdaemun district, and from higher up, panoramic views of Seoul. Stop at Ihwa-dong Village and you can have something to eat or drink.Return by going through the tunnel under the wall and walk down on the low side of the wall through a park until you reach the East Gate.See my photos.The 'experience' - walking up, the village and walking down takes about 1 1/2 at a leisurely pace.As city walls go, this is one of the best!", September 2019
16,5.0,Must do if in the area.,"This is an excellent museum to learn about the wall and the history of the city through the Joseon Dynasty.  It is just a short walk up the hill from the actual Dongdaemun (Large East Gate).  If time (and stamina) permits, continue up the wall itself to get great photo ops.Within walking distance beside the gate is also the DDP and the free Stadium Museum.  Doota department store and the JW Marriott are also within a block or so.", September 2019
17,2.0,A bit disappointing,"We followed the city wall whilst hiking up Inwangson mountain...the viewpoint at the top's great, but in all honesty, the city wall in Seoul looks like it was constructed just last month. The city wall in nearby Suwon is much more impressive.", September 2019
18,5.0,Portions all around the city,"If time allows try to check out the wall museum which educates you on the extensive history, destruction and rebirth of the wall.The four main gates represent the 4 virtues of Confucianism.There is a map called the Seoul City Wall map, if you collect all of the stamps, showing you toured the whole wall you can get a commemorative badge.", September 2019

20,3.0,Spectular at Night,"Go at night - great illumination.  Other than that, it is a reconstructed section of the old wall - without a gate.  It will take all of 15 minutes", August 2019
21,4.0,Unexpected ,Found the walk by accident as I was doing an unplanned work through the city.The walk is old and follows a ridge line to protect the old city. It is broken in line meaning you can find the wall then loose it again as you walk it’s line.I did think the wall was in good condition and must have had further defences however now it’s just the wall.It’s not the Great Wall but just a barrier., August 2019
22,4.0,Extensive,"About 12km of the original 18km still exists at various locations around the city. For a good walk by the walls Namsan Hill and Bukaksan Hill are good choices. Don't expect the Great Wall of China, they are quite low wall when walked inside.", July 2019

25,3.0,A day visit,I only did a part. To hot....But it is really a good idea to do the complete tour. Start at the City wall museum.... you walk in the city and in nature as it seems. The museum is also nice!You have nice views over the city., June 2019
26,5.0,Goes together well with mural village,"A relatively easy hike from mural village down to DongDaeMun.  Can enjoy seoul scenery from high above and see Namsan Towel from far away.  At the top, near Naksan Park, you can get a panoramic view of Seoul.  Very spectacular.  There are a lot of history behind these walls, and the are also signs that explain the wall changes and dynasty changes, people who enjoy a little bit of history and hiking would love this spot.", April 2019
27,5.0,Steep climb but worth it,"Discovered the climb up to Naksan Park following the Seoul City Wall almost be accident.  Path starts just North of Dongdaemun Gate.  Walked up on the inside of the Wall (which provides the best views out over the city), then back down on the outside of the Wall (some good photo opportunities of the wall itself).  Take water (especially in Summer), a hat, good footwear and a camera.  Plenty of places to stop on the way up to Naksan Park (the track doubles as a fitness circuit, and there is plenty of shaded seating).  Path varies between paved and unpaved on the way up.  Not really suitable for small children.", July 2019
28,5.0,Nice photo opp and parks,"Maybe like a lot of people, we just stumbled upon this wall while looking for KIM MISO's house (Secretary Kim KD Drama).  the trek is entertaining as well as exhilarating.  The wall crosses all types of neighborhood so you can always stop to get refreshments in one of the many restaurants and convenience stores. Please wear comfortable shoes as cabs do not pass that often so you end up walking past your targeted number of steps.TIP: the trees are wonderful depending on the season. I think Autumn is the best", November 2018
29,3.0,Stumble upon Seoul City Wall!!!,"I was walking around Dongdaemun when I campe upon the city wall!! It was just right off Dongdaemun station, exit 1 I think. It was nice, so much history. Come here for a relaxing time and just cool off....so nice in the evening, and it was good to see.", May 2019
30,5.0,A steep hike but great view,Walking up from Naksan park then down towards DDP is definitely the preferred route. Pleasant uphill but would have been more difficult the other way round due to the terrain. Decided to skip the mural village considering the residents prefer it that way., April 2019
31,5.0,"Since 600 years ago, Hanyangdoseong hugs the Seoul with the unique history, moments, people and many diaries. I got the","Since 600 years ago, Hanyangdoseong hugs the Seoul with the unique history, moments, people and many diaries. I got the second chance to visit this nice place with Funday Korea Networks. Thanks to them they provide a unique tour guide with presenting very interesting information about this wall. If you are visiting seoul don’t miss the opportunity to visit this historical charm in the heart of a modern city. Let’s see 5 most important reasons to visit this cool place:1: If you are a fan of hiking, you’d better try it at least once. You can experience the beauty of nature and dazzling view of Seoul. Beside I found a group named: CIK (Climbing in Korea) which offers very interesting programs for those who love hiking. (you can check it at meetup application). The Baegak Mountain would be not only the best hiking trails of Seoul City Wall but also you can find a 200-years old pine tree there. It is not famous only because of its age, in fact this tree bears the traces of 15 bullets in the gun battle between the South Korean military and police with the North Korean Special Forces unit who came to attack Cheong Wa Dae (Blue House) on 21 January 1968.2. You will be amazed by the huge effort of many people for construction of this wall. It is one the greatest historical places in Korea with over 600 years background. I recommend to go with a tour guide, or at least check more details on the historical background and the stories of its building. Since you well get a cool feeling while visiting there. That’s how I felt when I went there second time with the tour guide. Follow up funday programs, and if you are lucky you can visit that place again with them.3. Easy to access. The Seoul City Wall was originally surrounded Seoul during the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1897). Afterward it was extended for 18.6km along the ranges of Bugaksan Mountain, Naksan Mountain, Namsan Mountain, and Inwangsan Mountain. As a nice spot to start you can start from Hanyang Doseong. The Seoul City Wall consisted of 8 gates which but only six remain today. The North, South, East, and West gates of the wall are known as the “Four Great Gates” (Sukjeongmun, Heunginjimun, Sungnyemun, Dongeuimun). You can try either bus, subway or taxy in your convenience. The best way is to instal “naver map” in you mobile which offers searching in English as well, then try Dongdaemun (동대문 in korean).4. It is an architectural treasure and candidated for Unesco World Heritage status. the Great East Gate is one the architectural wonders. You can visit Dongdaemun Design Plaza there. You can find more information about the city’s efforts to have the wall designated as a World Heritage site. There has been sadly some destruction during years which effected some parts of the wall but the currently I appreciate they are carefully maintain this wall. You can see some white spot on the wall which looks like mushroom but actually they are some sensors for checking the wall status (movement, humidity, etc.)5. Last but not least, check the Seoul City Wall Museum which as a good news its free and you don’t have to pay for the entrance. You can see photos of old days, and find out even more about this unique wall there as a symbol of hardworking of Korean people. They also have nice presentation describing the origin of this wall. Thanks again FundayKorea for very interesting programs.", March 2019
32,5.0,5 Reasons why you should visit Hanyang Doseong,"Being built in 1396, Hanyang Doseong (Seoul city wall) is the longest wall of its kind in the world and definitely a place you should not miss during your visit in Seoul.Getting there is an easy task. Bus or subway are convenient, especially of the way transfer works in Korea. The stop you have to loom in the stops list is Dongdaemun (동대문 in korean). Our choice was bus and you know you are close when you see the gate on the horizon. But if you come by subway, the exits 9 and 10 gets you right in front of it. For reaching the beginning of the trail of the city wall, you will need to cross the big avenue. You know that you are in the right track when you see an informative sign about the trail.Make sure to wear comfortable clothes and shoes because a long walk is waiting for you ahead and have your camera ready for terrific pictures. At the beginning of the journey, it would seem that someone just put a bunch of rocks in a specific way to build a wall but as you continue going forward (“upwards” describes it better) you will start seeing a magnificent view of the city. If you were wandering, Seoul city wall had a function of safeguarding Hanyang (present Seoul) and demarking the city limits. The Seoul city walls were built in 1396 (617 years ago) during the fourth year of reign of king Taejo and only two years after relocating the capital of the new established Joseon kingdom (1392), taking in special consideration geomantic theory. The wall measures between 5 and 8 meters high and is about 18.6 kilometers long, of which around 70 percent has been restored to its original condition. Incredibly, nowadays it is possible to visit all gates, but it will take you a couple of days. If you have the opportunity go and visit at any location, the Seoul city wall. I really recommend you going near night time so you can enjoy Seoul view during day and night. In my opinion, Seoul has an amazing night view and it is something you wouldn’t like to miss.After a long walk make sure to reward yourself with a good drink in your favorite coffee shop and if you are still with energy after all that walking, you can shop since there are a lot of places to do it nearby Dongdemun. In conclusion, we can list 5 reasons why we should visit Hanyang Doseong:1. Our number one reason to visit Hanyang Doseong is that it is the place where the “old meets the new”. What we mean is that in a modern city like Seoul, finding a place that has so much history behind is something fascinating. And even there is a museum called “Seoul City Wall Museum” where they explain in more detail from its construction until all the efforts made for its renovation and preservation so tourist and citizens can appreciate its beauty.2. Even though it is an historical site, the way it has been remodeled for people visit, makes it a good “escape from the routine” place. Often people are immersed in daily routines and stressed from tiring jobs, for that reason, its well-designed trails makes it an interesting place where you can go for thinking, relaxing and having fun with friends or with your family since it provides all the facilities needed for everyone’s joy.3. Moreover, another important reason of why going there is the “healthy hiking” it provides. What a good way of having a walk and learn from it. It is not an intense hiking so it is suitable for all ages and all that workout with be rewarding by the exceptional views found on many parts of the way. It has many Insta stories places and the night view is spectacular. That is why we hardly encourage you to try both, day and night view and choose your favorite.4. It is not only a walk next to an old wall. It is also a place where other activities besides walking can be done. There, you can find the “Ihwa mural village” where you can eat, refresh with a drink or just enjoy the artistic mural or decorations found in there 5. For us as foreigners, going there and learning about the history behind it, help us “understand a little bit more the Korean culture”. It is part of their historical heritages where you can see and experience in first row 617 years of history from Joseon Dynasty and is still standing strong. Thus, it has the plus value that makes the city more attractive.", March 2019
33,5.0,5 reasons why you should visit Hanyang Doseong,"Did you know that Seoul is surrounded by a wall for over 600 years? Thanks to Funday Korea Networks I got to know about the background of the Wall. The Seoul City Wall goes by the name of Hanyangdoseong and was built for defensive purposes. Today it is the longest wall of its kind in the world and is under state protection as Historic Site No. 10. If these facts are not enough to motivate you for a visit, then here are five more reasons why it is a must for everyone who comes to Seoul. 1. Historical significance: The Seoul City Wall was built in 1396, four years after King Taejo established the Joseon Dynast and moved the capital to Hanyang (modern-day Seoul). The fortress wall witnessed a number of rulers, the Japanese occupation and the Korean War, which makes the 600-year old city wall a major historical monument. The Seoul City Wall Museum provides great and detailed information of the Hanyangdoseong for everyone who wants to know it all. 2. Special architecture: The wall, just as the whole city, was planed in consideration of the natural topography, Confucian principles, and various political, economic, and military factors. It is built along the ridges of four mountains (Baekgaksan, Naksan, Mongmyeosan, Inwangsan) and has four main gates, which represent the four virtues of Confucianism, and four ancillary gates. Interestingly, the structure of the wall is not uniform, as the wall was repaired over the centuries. By seeing the stone shape, you can easily determine in which period the section was built. You can also look out for one of the 297 stones with inscriptions, which contain names of workers and dates of the repair. 3. Witness history: Besides the unique architecture that shows you different periods at once, you can witness modern history by visiting the Seoul City Wall. The Baegak Mountain trail is the perfect example for that. Public access to this area was omitted for about 40 years, after the “Blue House Raid”, where North Korean commandos tried to assassinate the South Korean president Park Chung-hee in 1968. The mountain is not only the highest within Hanyangdoseong, it also bears a 200-year old pine tree, which has fifteen bullets from the battle between South Korean police and the North Korean Special Forces. After presenting your ID you can visit this historic place.4. Hiking spot: As the Hanyangdoseong leads through the mountains, it is a wonderful opportunity to enjoy nature and a beautiful view of Seoul. There are different courses that that differ in difficulty and duration, so one can find the perfect trail for oneself. With a length of 18.627 kilometers, a complete tour of the wall would take about 10 hours. The track I participated in, started at the Seoul City Wall Museum near Dongdaemun station, covered the Naksan Mountain and ended in Hyehwa. While you can enjoy a breathtaking scenery of Seoul on your way, you will also discover a lot of unique spots like the artistic Iwha Mural Village, the Myogaksa Temple and Naksan Park. 5. Discover Seoul from anywhere: Because the wall embraces the old city center of Seoul, you can start or end your journey at any gate and you will be able to visit touristic places nearby. Donuimun Gate in the West for example is really close to Gyeonghuigung Palace and the Seoul Museum of History while the Sungnyemun Gate is close to Namdeamun Market, which is a historic marketplace and remained popular until today. I would highly recommend a visit to Hanyangdoseong, as it is right next to all the popular attractions. It does not matter which trail you choose, because you will be able to see Korean architecture through time, enjoy nature and discover various places near the City Wall.", March 2019
34,5.0,5 Reasons why you should visit Hanyang Doseong,"On March 16th I visited Hanyang Doseong , also know as Seoul city wall, thanks to Funday Korea Networks. The wall is around 18km long and we just visited the Naksan mountain part of the wall.(Naksan Mountain Course, Hanyang Doseong) Although it was not my first time visiting this place, getting to know the historical background of this place made it more special for. This tour was an amazing opportunity to learn more about not only the Seoul City Wall but also the history of Old Seoul. And now I will write just some of the reasons everyone needs to visit this place for sure.1. Being able to see something from Joseon Dynasty in the middle of Seoul, a modern city, is so fascinating, also up on the Naksan mountain you can see the Old Seoul City part of the modern Soul which the wall surrounded in the past2. By visiting the museum, you can see the process of building the wall and how the wall looked in each historical period. Also you can learn alot about the wall and Old Seoul.3.

And see how smart were people back then for special things you can see on the wall.4. The view of Seoul you can see from the Naksan mountain is just amazing and YOU CAN TAKE MANY BEAUTIFUL PICTURES.5. The wall has many gates and one of the most beautiful ones is the Dongdaemun which you can visit if you come to Naksan mountain. Also Naksan park is so beautiful so you can enjoy your time there.It's so thoughtful of Korean people and government for trying to discover lost parts 9f the wall and for making it as a public place were people can visit.If you visited Seoul one day don't forget to visit this place as well and then write your own reasons for others to visit this place.", March 2019
35,5.0,5 reasons why you should visit Hanyang Doseong,"I have just had a great day with my friends earlier this month walking along Hanyang Doseong, the Seoul City Wall thanks to Funday Korea Networks. It’s the first time I have seen Seoul with such a differently captivating and historical charm since I first came here 5 months ago. This place is definitely a must-go if you come to Seoul and here are 5 reasons why 😉1. Following the fortress wall, you can bathe in the splendid scenery. The wall which covering a total length of 18.6 km stretches along many of Seoul’s mountains, making a beautiful trails for everyone. But “the best view comes after the hardest climb”, if you keep walking up the hill or the high mountain, you will be rewarded with one of the most precious views of Seoul. I couldn’t make it last time but definitely will soon. I heard someone said that Seoul is a city of layer and after visiting the Seoul Wall, I deeply understand that. Up here at the hill, Seoul appears clearly with the combination of old and new building, old and new architecture, embracing the history behind it.2. In Hanyang Doseong, especially at the Seoul City Wall Museum which is free to visit, you can learn more about the wall’s deep rooted history. Thanks to Funday Korea Network, I had the oppotunities to hear a presentation showing the historical artifacts relating to the transformation of Hanyang Doseong along with the history of Seoul through times. The Seoul City Wall was originally built in 1396, surrounding Seoul during the Joseon Dynasty for defensive purposes. From times to times, it has become one of the symbolic places of this beautiful and historical city.3. As the wall was built along the range of 4 big mountains in Seoul, it is indeed a ideal place for hiking. The entire wall would take an entire day to walk but it is conveniently devided into parts by eight main gates, but now only six remain standing. Therefore, with a map and a planned route, you can easily finish the hiking along the wall while enjoying the wonderful scenery of Seoul.4. Hanyang Doseong also has many ideal spots for picnic. As mentioned before, I visited the wall ealier this month, the weather was still cold. But undoubtedly, I will come back here with my friends in a warm and sunny day because it is a perfect place to have a picnic, especially in Naksan Park. Remember to bring a camera, believe me, you will have a lot of lovely and spectacular photos here, just like what you have been seeing in many Korean dramas.5. Walking along the Hanyang Doseong, you can find many amazing hidden spots. In my trip, I passed by the beautiful village in Naksan Mountains called Ilhwa Mural Village. This village was transformed into a creative and artistic heaven with full of paintings and sculptures. I have searched about some hidden spots like this (Prison History Hall, Naksan Gallery, Baegaksan, Waryong Park...) and planning to visit them someday soon. That is just 5 of much more reasons why you should visit Hanyang Doseong. If you are planning to come to Seoul, make sure to check out this awesome place. And if you are here in Seoul, you need no hesitation to visit the wall, choose comfy clothes and shoes, bring some snack and you will have a best experience ever when in Korea. Don’t forget to bring your camera 😉", March 2019
36,5.0,5 Reasons Why You Should visit Hanyang Doseong,"1. The History of South Korea and the People: When you look at this wall and learn the history, it is more than just a wall. It represents hard work, loyalty to country, and strength. The wall was made up of stone, wood and other materials, and the purpose was to protect the city against invaders. The original wall was built in the late 14th century under the Joseon Dynasty and was built in about 98 days by men brought in from different regions. The main materials were constructed of medium-sized stones held together by mud. As time went on and the wall began to break down, different materials were used. It is amazing to be able to walk along the wall and see the different time periods and people that are represented.2. Beautiful Scenery: Seoul is a crazy, busy city. The population of Seoul is roughly 9.7 million. Everywhere you walk and you are surrounded. However, walking along the wall there is so much peace and tranquility. You forget about the hustle of Seoul and you are transported into a paradise of some sort. No noise, no crowds, lots of space.3. Hiking: There are roughly 6 different trails around the city- Baegak Trail, Naksan Trail, Heunginjimun Trail, Namsan Trail, Sungnyemun Trail, & Inwangsan Trail. It would take about 10 hours to walk around the entire thing. It made me think of a good ole Pioneer Trek and is now on my South Korea to do list! If you are an avid hiker, this is not a huge hike, but to be part of a living museum is an amazing experience4. Location: I had originally found out about the wall through a blog I found on Pinterest so I assumed it would be difficult to find, however, because it is so big it was fairly easy to find! Also, a lot of people I spoke with had no idea it was there but once they heard about it they couldn’t help but see it when they went into Seoul. And because of the length, you could probably find different places of the wall to visit! Some parts of the wall are broken down, but you can still be directed to see it.5. Last, but most importantly to preserve the history and dignity of the wall and the people: I asked our tour guide what the people of Seoul thought about preserving and maintaining the wall and she implied that people really weren’t concerned about preserving it. My first point I talked about the dedication of the people, but seriously this is so important to remember. Pat of the wall building process, people would cut their initials into the wall and so people that are able to trace their genealogy back! THAT IS AMAZING! At one point people that were refugees into the city would build their homes on the wall. We need to remember the past, we need to remember where we came from. Most importantly, we need sites like this to see that we all are not very different and we go through similar trials and can come out strong.If you are in Seoul, I HIGHLY encourage you to check out the Seoul City Wall, you will not be disappointed.", March 2019
37,5.0,5 reasons why you should visit Hanyang Doseong:,"Having been in South Korea for more than 3 years, the Seoul City Wall is one of the landmarks I keep going back to, only to recently realize that it's because the experience is different every time. Therefore I compiled a short list on why every person visiting Seoul should have Hanyang Doseong on their itinerary.1.

Stretching for 18.6 kilometers, the Seoul City Wall is the longest wall of its kind in the world.3.	Hanyang Doseong is not only a history lesson, but also a good workout, because going around its entire length will definitely test your stamina. However, don’t worry! You can choose only to the courses appropriate for your fitness level without missing much of what the wall has to offer.4.	Walking around the Seoul City Wall you can enjoy a beautiful panoramic view of the capital and admire the modern buildings in central Seoul, among which you can find little hidden temples and other historical structures.5.	Whether you like hiking and spending time away from the polluted city, or you are just looking for the most aesthetically-pleasing background for your next Instagram photo, just following the Seoul City Wall will take you to your desired destination.", March 2019
38,5.0,Excellent views and lots of opportunities for unique experiences,Make sure you plan ahead of time - the wall is verrrrrry long! The entire wall would take an entire day to walk but it's conveniently broken into zones and the website has a dowloadable map. It's very accessible in certain parts of the city and there are many spots (like Naksan Park) that provide amazing views of the city.

39,5.0,“5 REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD VISIT HANYANG DOSEONG”,"Having studied in Korea for more than 5 months, I’m luckily to have chances to discover this country, particularly know more and more interesting places in Seoul. Huge thanks to Funday Korea Network’s Hanyang Doseong Tour, I can know that among several modern architectures around Seoul, there was a place wear a special historical and antique color, named Hanyang Doseong or usually called Seoul City Wall, a treasure trove of city history, stands as proof of this.	So guys, here is 5 reasons why you should visit this amazing place 1. Abroadening your knowledge about Korean history 	Along the Seoul City Wall, there once stood eight gates that were built between 1396-1398, but only six remain standing. The North, South, East, and West gates of the wall are known as the “Four Great Gates” (Sukjeongmun, Heunginjimun, Sungnyemun, Dongeuimun), while the Northwest, Northeast, Southwest, and Southwest gates are known as the “Four Minor Gates” (Changuimun, Hyehwamun, Gwanghuimun, Soeuimun). 	The main gates set up in the North, South, East and West are respectively named after “In” “Ui” “Ye” and “Ji”, which represent the four virtues of Confucianism.	The 5 virtues of a dutiful human being are benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and sincerity, which a king ough to cultivate and possess “Ji” means “wise”, wisdom that knows which one is right or wrong; “Shin” means “reliable”, a mind that is reliable and trustful; “Ui” means “righteous”, a mind that feels ashamed of injustice; “In” means “generous”,  a mind that loves people.	Hanyang Doseong operated as a city wall for the capital of Joseon for 514 years, from 1396 until 1910, setting a world record. Hanyangdoseong, completed in 30 years, was torn down in many parts due to city planning initiatives and the introduction of trams lines. However, significant sections of the wall remain. The best-preserved and well-known course is the Wall of Mt. Bukaksan.2. Ideal place to “let your hair down”	This place is surrounded by many big trees and always having fresh air. The last time I visited it, I was kind of stress, I really appreciate Funday for coming to my mind at that time, for sending me email about this tour. Joining this tour, I felt relaxing a lot, I have met lots of people from all over the world and we’ve had great time.3. Helping to level up your “hiking skill” 	As far as I know, a 160 – lb or 73 – kg aldult male will consume 3,660 kcal by walking around the entire Seoul City Wall, which is equivalent to swimming for 8 consecutive hours. Which means that if you can conquer this wall, your physical health will definitely be better. Funny sayings that you can eat anything you want, then walk around Seoul City Wall, you’ll never have to worry about your weight [LOL].4. Taking impressive photos	Hm you can refer to my attached photos for your own opinion. For me, every corners of this place have made an impression to my heart, I have to say “wow” with every scence that I’ve seen. Sometimes I barely took photos cause I want to enjoy it with my pure mind and eyes, you know, our eyes are the best cameras in the world. But yah, if you’re fond of taking photos and have the chance to travel to Korea, noted this place for your trip, it won’t let you down.5. Easily to reach whenever you have free time	You should present your ID to enter.- Opening hours (closing days: Every Monday)	Summer time (Mar. – Oct.): 9A.M – 4P.M	Winter time (Nov. – Feb.): 10A.M – 3P.M- Closing hours:	Summer time: 6P.M	Winter time: 5P.M	This “5 reasons” is just my quick review for a competition, but from the bottom of my heart, I really recommend this place for all of you who have read this review. 	If you travel to Korea, don’t miss this place, or you will have to go again haha.#theseoulcitywall #hanyangdoseong #hanyangdoseong2019 #theseoulcitywalltour2019#한양도성 #한양도성투어 #한양도성투어2019 #펀데이코리아네트웍스 #펀데이코리아#FKN #fundaykoreanetworks #fundaykorea #eventsinkorea #freeeventsinkorea #ilovekorea #iloveseoul", March 2019
40,5.0,5 reasons why you should visit HanyangDoseong,"Visiting Namsan Tower, Nammi Island or Myeong Dong are definitely experiences you have to try once in your life when you come to Seoul. However, this article will suggest you a place with a completely different style from the above locations. It is Hanyang Doseong (Seoul City Wall) and 05 reasons why you should visit it.1. Historical significanceIn English, Hanyang Doseong (한양도성) means “The city wall of old Seoul”. It was built in 1396 under King Taejo. The wall is 18.627 kilometers long and run along the ridge of Seoul’s four inner mountains: Baegaksan (Bugaksan), Naksan, Mongmyeoksan (Namsan) and Inwangsan. At the beginning, the wall was used to protect Seoul and divided between in and out of this city. Therefore, it is not only visit a simple place, you will enjoy the historical atmosphere enveloping here.2. Unique architectureHanyang Doseong carries the architecture of many periods of Korean culture and nation’s building skills. Depending on the period of construction, stone in the walls is different. This is indeed very interesting if you pay close attention. Besides, Seoul City wall has four main gates and four ancillary gates with special meaningful names which reminds people about the right way to live. For example, Sungnyemun gate means polite; Donuimun gate means righteous; Sukjeongmun means wise and Heunginjimun means generous. 3. Associated with other famous places It would be wrong if you think that there is no interested thing in Hanyang Doseong. Surrounding the whole city of Seoul, Hanyang Doseong associated with many famous tourist attractions such as Nam San Tower, Blue House or Dongdaemun area. This time I just had a short trip from Dongdaemun to Hyeamun but I saw many different places, including: the Church, the Temple, the Museum, the ancient village (Ihwa) and so on. Each place has its own unique features including both ancient and modern. There are many Korean dramas are filmed here like of Encounter of Song Hye Kyo and Park Bo Gum. 4. A way of doing exercise and meet lovely Seoul peopleBy searching in google: “A tour guide map of Hanyang Doseong”, you can easily find a map or an app to travel here. I believe that it would be very useful because it is not only give you the instruction but also give you about the distance, time and the amount of calories you have to consume for each specific stage. I have seen many adults and children come here to run, do exercise or just to breathe some fresh air. Besides that, if you are lucky, you also can meet some retired tour guides here. They are old but speak English every well and they are super funny. Listening to their stories about Seoul made me so surprised.  5. See the whole of Seoul The wall located in a high place so it is a perfect place to see the whole of Seoul. Looking down from here, you can see a Seoul both dynamic and friendly with environment and human. I am sure that no matter what time you are in Seoul city wall, in the dawn or sunset, you still can take many different beautiful photos without filters. Visiting Hanyang City Wall, I learned why people love and like Korea so much. The wall in particular and Seoul in general are not boring but full of history, profound humanity.", March 2019
41,5.0,5 REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD VISIT #HanyangDoseong,"Seoul City Wall is one of signature places where you have to visit when in Korea. For me, this place is so interesting with the harmonization between history and natural beauty, not just a Wall =)). So I'm here today to tell you why I am so fond of this Wall :>1.	Acquiring more knowledge about Korea including Korean history, architecture and people.About Korean history, Hanyang doseong enables me to know more about the ancient capital of Korea. It used to be smaller than now and covered by 4 main mountains. The center of this capital was for royalty and citizens living and doing business. Seoul city wall known as Hanyang doseong links four mountain including Baegaksan, Naksan, Namsan, and Inwangsan together. There were four main gates representing the basic tenets of Confucianism, namely, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom, and between them were four ancillary gates. I was really surprised that there was a ancillary gate which used to be used as a gate only for bringing dead people out to bury.About architecture, there are 4 types of arranging stones inscribing with information about the wall’s construction. The methods and types of stones also make me know that there always had the development in Korean architecture in the eras of different kings.2.	Ameliorating both your mental and physical health.Seoul City Wall has a total length of 18.627 kilometers which can become a suitable place for everyone to do exercise. As I prefer walking so much, Seoul City Wall is a great place for me to go for a walk every afternoon and train my health at weekend but unluckily, I am living too far from this place. On the other hand, this place can also be a comfortable place when you are tired or stressed. As this place is far from main road covered by many trees, the atmosphere here is quite fresh and quiet. As a result, you can escape from the hustle and bustle of busy life after a hardworking day or when you just need a place to relax.3.	Enjoying Seoul from an interesting sideThis place is at least 124m (at Naksan Mt.) higher than the ground so I can see the Seoul with an overview. Although I had just experienced Seoul City Wall at the point of Naksan Mt., I felt really incredible here. I can see both old and modern houses surrounding with trees, and you know it is kind of spring now so everything is super great. I have a thought that I will come back here some days in the evening to see how bling bling Seoul can be at night.4.	Having an opportunity to visit other signature places of Seoul.On the way with my commentator in Naksan Mt., my group accidentally went to a village called Ihwa. Ihwa village was so cute in my eyes with many beautiful painting in the house wall and some old-fashioned houses which I only saw in my favorite Korean drama called Reply 1988. Good news here is that you can hire a student uniform and take photos in every corners which makes you feel like a main actress in Reply 1988 :>5.	Taking photosSeoul City Wall has everything for you to take photos, everywhere can become your background . So let’s enjoy it. :)", March 2019

43,5.0,Memorable Hike,"Hiking along the Seoul Wall was a highlight of our trip.  We walked from Hyehwamun Gate through Waryong Park to Malbawi Information Center.  We enjoyed the fall colors, panoramic views and varied terrain.  Some sections were challenging with the uphill climb, but it was worth it.  Our goal is to hike the whole wall one day.", November 2018
44,5.0,Seoul hidden gem,"You have to visit this place if you come to South Korea. While most of the tourists go to Namsan Tower or Lotte Tower, you just need to climb up to this fortress to see the beauty of the city. Perfect place for a solo traveller like me. (Personally, I recommend 2 up to 3 hours to spend time here because i'm not a fan of history things)[You might want to look for the history first before visiting this place]Advice :1. Visit this place during the sunset and stay during the night and you will be fascinated by the night view of the Seoul2. This is the hidden part. If you come early, you might want to visit the famous Ihwa Mural Village first because it is not far from the Walls. Many K-Dramas have taken scenes here! (You won't find this information unless you travel with locals)", November 2018
45,4.0,History meets big city,"We walked along a section of the city wall in Namsan park, from the top of Namsan down to Myeongdong. The wall is beautiful and interesting, it's inspiring to see the effort that has gone into preservation and reconstruction. Would love to go back to Seoul, see more of the city wall and visit the related museum.", October 2018
46,5.0,A full day's hike around the city,"I finally accomplished my goal to follow the entire city wall trail in one day. If you do this, start early and bring plenty of water and snacks because there are not many places to get drinking water, especially on the northern and toughest part of the circle. Check the schedule, you can only visit the northern section during the daytime and not on Mondays. Check the excellent website for details about the hike. It took me about 12 hours with a few short rest breaks. I did the northern section first since it is the toughest one. You get great views of the city from different angles.", August 2018
47,5.0,Join the locals for a hike around the city - it's stunning,"We walked around half of Seoul's city wall and spent a fantastic day doing so. The only reason we didn't do more, was the fact that my husband wore the wrong shoes.It was a beautifully sunny day and the views over the city were fantastic and we had a lovely lunch along the way. I loved the fact that the you are in the city and immersed in nature and history at the same time. It's not an easy hike as there are plenty of steps up and down the various sections of the wall, but that means its a good work out! The hike is popular with the locals who are all well equipped in full hiking gear. A must do if in Seoul for a few days! I would love to come back and do the full circuit.", November 2017
48,5.0,The old city wall that is still under the recovery,"This is an amazing city walls built around the old Seoul(Hanyang) in Joseon Dynasty. Even though most parts have been rebuilt over several decades, it's fun to visit.- Koreans at that time used to talk a walk and enjoy the view of city walls. And there's a guide map to feel it again today.- Among those city walls, Dongdaemun Seonggwak Park and Baekbeom Park(Baekbeom Square) are easy to access.- The city walls consist of several tracks which means it's not connected entirely. I think Naksan Park and Namsan Park are two most crowded tracks.- City walls are also built on mountains like Namsan, Inwangsan and Bugaksan. It may be a bit tough for seniors or young children.- There are four main gates and four small gates. Some of them are still remaining. Sungnyemun(Namdaemun) and Heunginjimun(Dongdaemun) are famous.- Some of them are good sunset points in Seoul. I recommend the top of Inwangsan Mountain.", October 2018
49,5.0,Seoul City Wall Hike,"Seoul City Wall (also called Hanyangdoseong) is an 18 km structure surrounding the city.  Much of the wall has been preserved or rebuilt but there are sections that are absent.  My wife and I hiked along the wall from the Heunginjimun (East) Gate in Dondaemun to the Changuimun Gate.  It is 7 km long, took almost 4 hours, and was our favorite part of our stay in Seoul.  Beautiful, moderate hike.First, bring your passport as the last half of the hike from the Malbawi Information Center to the Changuimun Gate is a restricted military area on account of it overlooking the President's House.  You need a passport to enter.  This section of the wall opens at 9 AM.  It is closed on Monday.  Second, I would follow our direction from the East Gate counterclockwise as the end of that route has many, many, many stairs - down going counterclockwise, up if you go clockwise.  I would not have wanted to start the hike with hundreds of stairs.From the start at the East Gate, you can choose to take the path inside the wall or outside.  I would recommend starting on the inside where you will pass the City Wall Museum and have access to a side visit to the Iwha Mural Village and the Naksan Gallery as you ascend Naksan Mountain.  Once you pass the peak of Naksan Mountain, you will start downhill and soon reach a street that traverses the wall.  At that point, I would switch to the outside the wall path.  We went on the inside path and got a little lost as we lost sight of the wall.  We eventually made it to the next Gate (Hyehwamun) but it is much easier to find from the outside the wall path.  Just past this gate you will come to the Hanyangdoseong Exhibition and Visitor Center.  You can stop, get a rest and get a map if you do not already have one.  They open at 9 AM.  If not open, follow the signs (or the little medallions in the street) to continue the hike to the next part of the wall - fairly easy to find.  Then you follow the wall to Waryong Park.From this Park it is a gradual climb along the wall to the Malwabi Information Center where you will be given a pass and enter the restricted military area.  From here, no photos to the South are allowed.  A fairly steep incline leads you for about a kilometer to the summit of Baegaksan Mountain.  Then down many steps to the final gate.  Again, you can enter the hike from that gate (Changuimun) but have to contest the many stairs in the up direction.  We stopped here and walked back to our hotel in Insadong or you can take a City bus. Or you can continue along the wall over Inwangsan Mountain (closed Monday). The hike was beautiful with great vistas, pine forests, interesting views of the wall up to 8 meters high, and other flowers and birds.  We started on Sunday morning at 7:30 AM and got to the restricted area around 9:15 AM. Not very crowded. Dondaemun Subway station, Line 4, Door 9 brings you right to the East Gate (Heunginjimun).  City Wall Museum opens at 10 AM.Bring some water and enjoy.  Just keep to the wall and follow the signs.  You will be glad you did.", August 2018
50,5.0,Take a hike along city wall and get views over neighbourhoods,"Construction of the stone city wall (Hanyangdoseong) began in 1394, designed to protect the city, much of the wall was built on the ridges of the surrounding mountains, when complete the wall measured 18627 metres long, varying in height from five to eight metres. Today there is only 13370 metres of the wall remaining and a good place for acity hike.  On our first visit to Seoul we did not have the opportunity or know to hike along the City Walls, on our recent return visit to Seoul we made a point of finding an easy accessed section of the wall, this was from Dongdaemun.  Across the road from Heunginjimun Gate is a uphill path to the wall, this path takes you to the City Wall Museum, which was great to visit, and all the way up to Naksan Park where there are views over neighbourhoods.  It is then possible walk further north.  There are other sections of the wall that can be discovered like over near Dongnimmun/ Seodaemun Prison History hall.  Wear comfortable shoes, take water, snacks and sunscreen and have fun.", April 2018
51,4.0,City Wall and City Wall Museum,"The City Wall of Seoul has a fascinating story. If you are hiker, you can hike along this wall for most of the way, yet some parts are off limit. A museum was dedicated to this wall and it walks you through the centuries. Dongdeamun subway stop takes you to a part of the wall and its museum.", October 2017
52,4.0,Great View,It's great to view of the city and nature. The locations so near from JW Mariot Hotels. You must visit this place., October 2017
53,4.0,SPECTACULAR VIEWS of Seoul at the Seoul City Wall,"Walking the City Wall is a great way to see how modern Seoul is becoming and experience flashes of the past at the same time!  Depending on how much time you have, you can choose a short and easy 1 hour route, or a harder 3.5 hour route.  If you are really short on time, you can walk the four flights of stairs directly up to Naksan Park for some amazing views!We started at Dongdaemun Gate, walked through the Seoul City Wall Museum (free) then continued on to Naksan Park.  It took us about an hour.  Some of the path was steep, but very safe.  The path is paved with cement or concrete unless you are walking immediately next to the wall. Sunset was spectacular!  Don't forget bug spray though because the bugs start swarming as the sun sets.  We have a video that you can find by searching ""Amy Moncure"" for more visuals.", June 2018
54,4.0,The alternative way to see Seoul,"We spent 2 days covering the wall. It was cold in March when we visited , especially if your are from the tropics, but the walk warmed us up so much we lost the jackets and was down to a base layer plus a hiking shirt for temperatures between 0-5 celcius. The signage could be a bit challenging at times but common sense prevails.", May 2018
55,5.0,Great way to see many aspects of the city,Follow the Seoul city wall trail (aka Hanyangdoseong trail) to get a unique perspective on the city. Seeing the ancient remnants of the wall is interesting in itself., November 2017
56,4.0,Seoul City Wall walk,"The Seoul City wall walk covers the entire 19km stretch around Seoul.At all four main gates you can collect a chop at the little stamphouse. The walk you can do at your own pace, not necessarily all in one day. After collecting all four chops you'll receive a badge to rememver your achievement. The walk brings you to memorable views and city areas around town. At some areas the steps can be a bit steep but definitely worth to take.Best times are autumn and spring to enjoy the views most.The Seoul City wall museum is next to the Dongdaemun gate, a good basis to start the walk with. Don't forget to bring your identification card or passport to access the northern section, north of the Blue House.", March 2018
57,5.0,Great adventure and fun,"This place is amazing. Would recommend it to anyone going to Seoul to stop by and take a hike around the fortress. To get to the wall, we decide to walk through the old village instead of taking the bus.", January 2018
58,5.0,Excellent hike on a nice day,"Started at Dongdaemun Gate, you will see the start of the trail across from the Gate. It is well paved and you just follow the wall. It is a hike uphill so wear comfortable shoes. Not too far, you will reach Ihwa Mural Village which will provide plenty of photo opportunities as there are many murals all over the houses in this small village. So if you are only planning to do section of the wall, starting at the Dongdaemun Gate will be good so at least you can see the Ihwa Mural Village along the way.", November 2017
59,4.0,Great view over looking the city from above,"Bring your sneakers because you want to take a long wall to the top. Along the wall you see some of houses still constructed back in the area of times. When you get the top you can see the amazing view of the city. It is worth seeing. This place is free. If you don't want to walk all the way, take a left turn into the path, walk downhill and see the local community. Some of old folks are in amazing shape. They walk up and down the steep hill to get to where they are going. There is a Seoul City Museum that is near by.  Go see it first.", November 2017
60,4.0,Long walk but worth it ,"Depending on where you have started your walk, you will see different parts of Seoul walking along this wall. Although it is not as majestic as the Great Wall of China, it is a beautiful historical site. As the route span many kilometres long, I would suggest that you do a bit of research before setting off to see this Wall. I didn’t do much research and started my walk from the Seoul City Wall museum.  It was along the way up the steep slope that I came across a map directory showing the whole length of the wall. Recommendation:Wear comfortable shoes, do your research to decide where you want to start your route.", November 2017
61,4.0,Seoul City Wall,Try to choose such a day with proper weather. Walk along the wall as much as you can. You will have nice views of the city. Worth visiting., October 2017
62,4.0,Great walk,Make sure you walk up to the top as it will give you very beautiful view of the city. Worth the hike and time spent. Make sure to drop by at the museum too., September 2017
63,5.0,Fantastic for walking and great views,"I walked along the eastern and northern sections of this wall. It was brilliant. Note that you need to show picture ID for the northern part as it is sensitive and part of the defence system for the city. The northern part is better than the eastern part. There are superb views towards the mountains and the walk is through woods and is sheltered in many places.You can do a short section or a long section, up to you. Good for 1-8 hours or more if you have the time.Note that much of the wall's top sections have been rebuilt but it still looks impressive.", September 2017
64,5.0,Hike up from the East Gate,"When you are at the East Gate, follow the wall up into the mountain nearby and just keep going.  You will be rewarded with a nice steep hike, great views, a quiet neighborhood and ultimately some great lookouts over the city.  Keep going to the lookouts, which are a bit up there.  From the first lookout, descend into the neighborhood via funky shops, stairs and even a hairpin turn in the road - a great and interesting descent!", August 2017
65,2.0,Historic but nothing special,"Significant portion of Seoul City Wall have been removed. The remaining portion of Seoul City Wall preserved the old looking. However, we can see that there are a lot of modern repairs an maintenance on the city wall. If you have ever visited the Great Wall in China, City Wall of Xian, etc., you will not feel anything special of the Seoul City Wall.", August 2017
66,5.0,Can be seen nicely from Namsan Park,This is not a wall to be compared to the Great Wall of China.  However you will be able to take some nice pictures at the top of the wall from Namsan Park.  The wall winds itself down from the top of the park.  Following the wall up or down is not for the feint hearted so put your trainers on!, June 2017
67,5.0,Beautiful views!,"I really enjoyed walking along the city wall. It's got great views of nature and the city. I did an evening walk, so it was bright out when I started and when I was done, it was dark out. But no worries, the city wall lights up at night with plenty of lamps to brighten the path and you get a different view in the dark. Along the wall is plenty of nature as well, as it is next to a few parks. It does go up and down, so you get a pretty good workout from walking along the wall. There are plenty of areas to rest and take photos. This is a must visit attraction if you are visiting Seoul and want some exercise while taking in gorgeous views!", May 2017
68,4.0,Serious Hike - Lots of Stairs & Great Views,"Hiking the entire loop is a major undertaking, but well worth it on a beautiful day.

You will need your passport to go through the Military area & no photos allowed there.", April 2017
69,3.0,Short hike in the middle of the city,A short walk from Dongdaemun Plaza. You'll find a gate which leads to a part of the now preserved parts of the city wall that once surrounded the city from the envaders. It's best viewed at night without any entrance fee. Good for viewing the busy street below., March 2017
70,5.0,Great experience,"I started off at Dongdaemun station, from where the path is very easy to find. After a while you can visit Ihwa village on the left-hand side, which is very recognisable when you lots of cafes and people with selfie-sticks. Once you've visited the highest point in Naksan Park, it's best to take the path on the right-hand side of the wall (I had to retrace my steps). I had planned to walk to Changuimun Gate but the paths towards the Malbawi information centre and the Sukjeongmun Gate were completely covered in ice, which I couldn't manage in the shoes that I was wearing. I ended up taking the road down a bit, followed by a walk in the Samcheong Park, which was also very nice, although I couldn't tell if there was an alternative way up to the next gate. I was ready to have lunch so I descended to Bukchon village but I will definitely continue my walk the next time I visit Seoul. Apart from the icy conditions, the paths are often paved, well-maintained and covered in mats in places to make them less slippy (which doesn't stop the ice in the shade though). The trail is also well signposted, even in places where you can only see traces of the wall. You need to be reasonably fit to do this because there are a few steep sections but it's also easy to do the path in sections.", February 2017
71,5.0,Lots of small sections or the whole wall,"There is a pathway that can be followed around the entire wall. Get a map before you start as it has access points and approx walking times. Takes 12 hours to do in one hit but easy to do in sections over several days. The section up to Seoul Tower is very popular and can get busy. The top section over the mountains has opening times (winter 10-3, summer 9-4, closed Mondays).", January 2017
72,4.0,Hike,Was looking for N Seoul Tower but came across this place with steep walk up. Was panting when I reached the top. Suddenly it dawn upon me the long stretch of wall was something ancient. Great view of Seoul at the top, December 2016
73,5.0,Wall,"Good hike. Right by the Mariott, subway station, markets and some shopping. Nice view of the city once you hike a little bit", December 2016
74,5.0,Naksan Mountain Trail - Easy on Elderly ,"Went with my 63 year old mother, which she found the trail is not taxing even though the trail started with steps, followed by one steep slope. The path is well paved and there are plenty of are to rest when tired. Try to reach early in the morning to avoid scorching sun as some part of the path is open, not covered by trees. This path is like the ""back alley"" of the villages, so try to be silent when we walk by. After 15 mins walk, you will reach Naksan Park where you can you can have an bird's eye view of the city. Another15 mins you will be the famous Ihwa Mural Village. Here you can also able to view Namsan Tower. Try to be here early to avoid crowd. Continuing downward path, you will reach Dongdaemun.

Estimate to spend 3-4 hours including exploring Naksan Park and villages.", September 2016
75,5.0,Best thing to do in Seoul. Wonderful urban hike!,"Best thing I did in Seoul! You can do the whole loop in one day, or you can do it in portions. Make sure you get the map from a tourist office in advance to help you plan. The parts over the Baegaksan 343m, Inwangsan 340m, Namsan 271m and Naksan 124m are step. This is a HIKE, not a stroll in a park. It can be hard to find your way, especially in the urban areas where the wall is missing. Fortunately, there are small plates or circular signs on the pavement, on the walls of buildings or attached to lampposts that says Hanyangdoseong or Fortress Trail. It can also be useful to look carefully at the dotted path on the map, since detours are sometimes indicated there.I got my badge at the Sungnyemun gate guard post. Both it and the Malbawi Information Center are closed on Mondays. I only stamped my map at the two other stops, and I'm not sure if it is possible to get a badge there.I did it in two days. I first did Sungnyemun to Hyehwamun one day, and then the rest the other day. I then got my badge at Sungnyemun. Both of these points are easy to get to by suway.There were lots of people doing the hike, but almost only locals.", December 2016
76,4.0,Fantastic hike,"Convenient location for a mountain and forest hike. You can get on the trail from lots of different locations and the trail runs in a circle. Beware most of the monuments on the trail are closed on Mondays, so you can still hike the trail but not visit any of the gates.", November 2016
77,4.0,Great walk but don't forget about the humidity,"I love walking so I really got much pleasure from this few hours slow pace walk. You get very nice views of Seoul and, thanks God, there are several places to have a rest during the trail. But you should be in a good shape - it's more like hiking in mountains than just walking in the city. And take water - it was my mistake, I forgot to take it - so I had some tough moments - climate in Seoul is very humid for me, so I felt not good. Choose comfy clothes and sport shoes, and don't forget your camera. The views are really amazing, especially from the park.", September 2016
78,4.0,Great walk but only for people in good shape,"This is a 18km long walk with some parts which are very steep. You will be able to walk on the trail along the fortress wall, to get a panoramic view of Seoul at some times and even (if you have your password with you) enter in a restrictive zone with guards, cameras and motion detectors (Blue House security).", September 2016
79,5.0,Let's take awalk,"First of all, let me tell you that I love walking, for real. So when I found out about Seoul city wall, i was so excited. Although I did not take the full route of walk, only partly from the Namsan park, but I was so happy. From the distance, you can see the view of Seoul. But, take a note, I would not recommend this for older traveler or ones who travel with kids.", July 2016
80,5.0,Great Sunday walk,"The trail is amazing to walk on - it is quiet and really beautiful. You get great views of Seoul . I started from Heunginjimun Gate and walked until Hyehwamun Gate. Right now, in July 2016, the Seoul Wall Museum is closed!!! Although many sites suggest you start from there, right now you can't.", July 2016
81,5.0,Baegak Mountain Trail was awesome,"I did the Baegak Mountain Trail which was one of the more challenging parts of the City Wall hike. As this part is heavily guarded by the military, u will need your passport to be issued a tag. Do not take photographs of any security cameras of picture facing the direction of the city as they are ""military secrets""! The hike and and views were awesome. Start at Changuimun gate and exit Waryong Park for a hike of abt 3.5-4km. Bring loads of water to hydrate in this summer heat!", July 2016
82,5.0,Seoul city wall,"Did only the part along the Namsan park and the little one around dongdaemun, would like to return some day and try to follow the recommended routes on the Korean tourism website! It's of a much better scale than the one in suwon so do prepare for 1-2 days!", March 2016
83,4.0,Relaxing Hike Along a Fortress Wall,"We did the 2.2 km hike from Hyehwamun Gate to Heunginjimun Gate (Dongdaemun Gate).  After alighting from Hyehwa Station, we walked to Hyehwamun Gate.  However, the entrance to the trail is not exactly at Hyehwamun Gate, it is diagonally opposite of the gate.  We did ask around for the direction.The classical music played throughout the trail gave a feeling of serenity and brought one back to the past. At certain sections of the trail, we were able to capture the panoramic view of Seoul.  We also passed by some residentials along the way.  This is a place where many locals go for their leisure walk and exercise.  It is something different from the usually crowded and commercialized tourist spots.  However, we missed the Ihwa Mural Village which is accessible from Naksan Park according to some of the materials that I have read.  Naksan Park is accessible about half way through the trail.  If I were to to visit again, I would have got ready some pictures in my smartphone to ease the communication when asking for information from the locals.  If you are into shopping, plan this in the morning.  Once you're done with the hike, you may continue with shopping at Dongdaemun Market or visit Dongdaemun Design Plaza.", October 2015
84,5.0,Steep Walk up the hill to Namsan follow the wall,I didn't know about the city wall until I was walking up to Namsan Park and it was just there in front of me! It is a great structure and when you get to the top of the park you can see the wall all the way down into Seoul.  The wall can be seen from the top of the park and the Seoul Namsan Tower so no need to  make a special visit.  Just go about your daily tourist trips and you will no doubt see it along the way., March 2016
85,4.0,free long hikes,"The city wall is not very well organized in some sections.  Missing all together in others.  Easy to get lost in...  But some sections are well done and rebuild, especially when combined with local parks.  Anyways, it is very challenging to do the entire wall in a day.  To get started, the Namsan (south) section is medium difficult but well developed.  The Naksan section is shorter on the east side.  But for a challenge, do the North and North West sections that climbs through two large peaks, 340 m high each.  Be ware that the north section is a fully active military zone and you need to have your passport to get it.  It is not very pleasant to be watched by solders throughout your hike.", June 2015
86,5.0,"No shopping, no entry fees = Good!","I only did the Inwangsan section of the Seoul City Wall trail, as I took the wrong turn and strayed too far from the next section of the trail, and it started raining too.  So I decided to take a bus back to the city instead of continuing.Granted it's no Geat Wall of China, and many parts are restored rather than original.  Nevertheless, it was still a good hike with great views all round (weather permitting).   Compared to what else Seoul has to offer - shopping, beauty salons and plastic surgery, this is definitely more for me.On my next visit to Seoul I would definitely hike the other sections to complete the loop.", March 2015
