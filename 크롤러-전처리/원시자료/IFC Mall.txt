1,4.0,Nice upscale mall,"Yeouido is the financial district and hence the IFC mall is upscale in its nature. Clean, organized, with a nice variety of shops and restaurants. In the basement there is a plethora of restaurants of all kinds, worth a visit. The Conrad hotel is right next door and overall it is easy to get there by metro. Also recommendable is a stroll to the Han river which is only a few minutes from the IFC mall.", August 2019
2,5.0,"Beautiful, pristine shopping center. Great place for people watching.","I visited this mall first week in August, 2019. I enjoyed it. I have to say I don't quite understand the observation made by some reviewers that it's not a particularly ""authentic"" Seoul experience. There's nothing inauthentic in the South Korea of 2019 about high end shopping centers. Indeed, you'll certainly see a lot fewer foreigners in such a place than you will at one of the city's numerous palaces or tourist hotspots. In any event, I thought this place was one of the most beautiful malls I've ever visited. The collection of stores is fine -- nothing to write home about, and the mall isn't overly huge. But it's just very, very well-maintained. Overall it's pretty upscale, And it has some solid eateries. And it's the perfect place to observe upscale Seoulites doing their thing. Great transit connections, too. Definitely worth a visit if you're tying to beat the heat, as I was on that scorching August afternoon. It's also a reasonable walk to a number of parks. I ended up heading north to a bridge that took me across the Han river in the early evening. Great exercise and a breathtaking view of the cityscape.", August 2019
3,4.0,High-end mall in Yeouido,"Premium mall under the International Finance Centre (IFC) buildings next to Yeouido Park.  Connected to Yeouido Station and Conrad Hotel.  Many international and luxury brands (not really the place to come for a bargain...).  Large number and range of eateries, from coffee shops through to bars and restaurants.  Provides a good dining alternative if you are staying at the Conrad Seoul.  Beautifully maintained.  An apparently pets are allowed!", July 2019
