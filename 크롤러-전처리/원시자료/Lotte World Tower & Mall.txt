0,3.0,Huge mall,The mall is connected to the metro station so it's quite convenient to reach. We went on the new year eve for the countdown fireworks but it was smaller scale and not as amazing as compared to the one in 2019. Seems to have a great mix of shopping and food options would consider, January 2020
1,5.0,Great Shopping Mall,This 7 story shopping mall has great restaurants and activities including a large movie theater with a 4D screen., July 2019
2,4.0,"Nice building, but its a building",, January 2020
3,3.0,Only go if you are planning on spending big money,"We visited the Lotte Tower as it was not far from The Westin where we were staying. There was a constant stream of people going in and out so we were intrigued. The entire place is full of designer shops, as well as the surrounding area. We compared prices and they were similar to what you would pay in Australia. Overall it was a bit of a letdown but interesting to see. Not a great selection for Men.", January 2020

5,3.0,The ventilation needs improvement,, January 2020
6,5.0,I love this place!,"What an amazing experience and we had so much fun! The food, the stalls and the view, all perfect! You will find almost anything and everything there", November 2019
7,4.0,Nice place,"I enjoyed this park even though I went on a day when a tropical storm was passing through. The entertainment was good, the food reasonable. Some rides had some really long lines like The French Revolution (3 hours cue). Some rides I could not ride because of the restraints being to small for my large frame. but most I could ride.", October 2019
8,3.0,A great view on a clear day ,, January 2020
9,3.0,Needs to be managed better,"Incredible views, no doubt. However, zero information about the building. A 2 hour wait in a boiling, non air conditioned room will suck the excitement out of the activity. Nothing to do upstairs and the terrace is totally closed off so it’s not any more interesting than looking from the window.", December 2019
10,2.0,Mickey Mouse attraction,"Very disappointing. More like a children’s amusement park than a serious attraction. No interesting information about the buildings construction or engineering just toys, sweet shops and cartoon photos for the kids who were far too young to appreciate the wonders of such a magnificent building. The management should go to Taipei 101 or Petronas Towers to see how it should be done.", December 2019
11,5.0,Amazing is an understatement,The Lotte World Tower is an astounding architectural achievement! Standing on a glass floor at 119 stories above the ground is scary as heck! It was incredible looking down on 30 story buildings that looked like toys. We were there on a clear day and the views stretched off forever. The elevator ride from ground to 119 in just under 60 seconds was pretty incredible. The tickets are not cheap but worth the price in my opinion!, December 2019
12,3.0,Best View,"Took the world’s first 60secs to level 118! The feeling was well, nothing much. Just abit if ears stuck. The technology in the lift is also awesome. Super high up the tower, could see the overall of Seoul. It’s beautiful", December 2019
13,5.0,This place is great!!,This mall is worth visiting. The stores and restaurants are great. Go up the escalator to the theatre and go out to the deck outside. You look over the city and there are fun things up there!, October 2019

15,4.0,Super Fun!,, November 2019
16,5.0,Lotte Tower at Night!,Lotte Tower provides a great view of the city. The flashing lights all around the city and bridge makes it a must see at night!, November 2019
17,5.0,Great views,Excellent views of the old Seoul and the new Seoul.  Seeing the many bridges from the 123rd floor was great.  The glass floor looking down on the street below was mind blowing., October 2019
18,5.0,lovely place,, November 2019
19,5.0,Excellent views,, November 2019
20,1.0,!!! 2h in total QUEUE Up- and Downstairs to the Tower !!!,, November 2019
21,5.0,MUST VISIT during sunset !,Standing on a glass floor on one of the tallest buildings in the WORLD was a tad scary but so worth it. Views of the city and surrounding hills were grand while the sun was setting., June 2019
22,5.0,Best vies in Seoul,I can rave on all I like about being 123 stories and 480 odd metres in the air but unless you go up you won't ever appreciate just how cool the vies of the nightlights and the view of the Han River are., November 2019
23,5.0,A bit of theme park excitement.,"If you visit with your Discover Seoul Pass you will get a small discount going up the tower, but price is not unusual for any other attraction such as this in other parts of the world. We paid EUR 19 per person and it was far more entertaining with the laser light show and the LCD display screens. Once you get up to the top via the elevator you can go higher up using the escalators as there are 3 more viewing floors. Coffee shop and sweet shop available. Sadly the air quality was not good when we went so visibility was not optimal, very hazy. The mall itself was fun with lots to see and play with. Fancy shops and I did not feel bored.", October 2019
24,4.0,Interesting but pricey,"Visited the Lotte Sky Tower this week. Arrived by Metro and entered the site via the street level because I wanted to see the tower from the outside and take pics.  When I left to go back to the metro I didn't have to go to the street level. There is a connecting tunnel, but don't ask me how to find it, I just followed the signs for a long while.  Anyway, the ticket office is actually in the ""basement"" (floor # 1BF?) / Metro station level.  There are lots of shops in the 1BF level so it took a minute to find it.  Then, it costs about $25 bucks to go up.  I received a 10%(?) discount for using a Visa card, but that was just an unplanned bonus.  There are a few corridors you have to navigate before you get to the elevators.  The walls and ceiling are constantly flashing images so it's a little disconcerting but I guess entertaining if one were stuck in line.  Once you get to the top, you are at the 117th floor (start of observation area).  I will admit this whole visit was well executed and planned, the ""reveal"" is amazing and everyone did go ""oooh"" collectively haha.  Great views obviously since you are so high up.  The glass floor is cool.  There is this whole photo spots pre-planned package thing that I opted out of since I brought my own camera, so I'm not sure how much that costs (if anything, maybe it was free?)  There are various cafes and such as you wander between floors 117th - 120th.  The elevator down is on 120th floor, and there is a line, but it went pretty fast.  Overall, kind of a check the box kind of thing IMHO, but I personally feel the view from N Seoul Tower at Namsan is way better.  From Lotte Tower, you can see the Han River, bridges, mostly apartment buildings, and most of southeast Seoul, but overall, not worth $25 IMHO.", November 2019
25,5.0,high feels,I went there at night - seeing Seoul late at night was a nice experience. The glass floor in the two spots give you some thrills but its a nice sensation! Definitely go!, October 2019
26,4.0,Awesome Tower,Accessed from inside the train station this is a really great Tower experience. Out of the 4 we experienced in South Korea this was easily the best. A couple of staged photo shots then up in the super fast elevator. Once at the viewing level you soon realise there are escalators taking you higher and to various shops and cafes etc. Glass floor part is cool and all in all it was really good., October 2019
27,5.0,Spectacular,, October 2019
28,4.0,Lotte World Tower is really impressive!,"The entrance ticket was a bit expensive but overall the experience of the visit was really pleasant. We went during the nighttime which was nice to see the overview of Seoul with the street lights, but I think for a better experience it would be best to go during the daytime.", October 2019
29,5.0,Incredible view,"Probably one of the best 360 degree view of a city you can find anywhere in the globe. Incredible scenes. You are on the top of the 6th tallest building on Earth, as well as the worlds fastest double decker lift to get that high. Incredibly can also see the vastness of Seoul and planes landing nearby, well worth it. Can also access open air sections to view from, and a glass floor section. You just love to see it.", October 2019
30,5.0,Lotte tower,"One of the best tours I’ve been on. The views are spectacular from every angle. Our tour guide allotted 2 hours for pictures plus he planned the trip at sunset. Amazing place, a must see.", October 2019
31,5.0,Amazing building,"One of the best tallest buildings I have visited. Very, very modern (opened in 2017), beautiful architecture, very high observation deck (478m), including a nice glass floor section, great views to all Seoul.", October 2019
32,5.0,Very nice.,"Nice, large complex containing a hotel, mall and amusement park. There are many things to see and do and you can spend a whole day going inside it without going out.", August 2019
33,5.0,Must See,This is a very beautiful building from the outside. You can then take the ride up to the top for about $25 each. Give yourself at least an hour and preferably two hours. It was not very busy when we visited but there are multiple queues that take at least 30 - 40 minutes to get to the elevators even on a slow period. You can book ahead online to insure faster entrance. The views are awesome and there is a glass floor. This is a must do., October 2019
34,5.0,Amazing,, October 2019
35,5.0,World's Largest Movie Screen,"The Lotte World Tower is home to the Super Plex G, the world's largest movie theater screen according to Guinness Book of World Records. A friend and I saw Infinity War in it and it was worth. Just make sure to arrive early for good seating among the nearly 700 seats.", November 2018
36,5.0,Wow,"You will see amazing views from the tower, the elevator is very quick and theirs a museum that you can walk around before you head up to the top. Wow is all I can say", October 2019
37,4.0,Wow,"Never se so many people trying to by so meny things in the last floorrs of this big building, you need your pasport, and by the way is cheaper in the states", October 2019
38,4.0,A fun experience,"Despite the price tag, the views from the tower are impressive and it's worth going up. Especially on a clear day you can see a lot.", September 2019
39,5.0,Definitely worth a visit,, September 2019
40,5.0,Modern Architecture,"Visiting this building is a mind-blowing experience. It's ~500 metres tall in the other side of the city. It's really tall! Once you enter the lift (elevator), it takes just 20-30 sec to reach the top. Then the view is simply breath-taking!! It's difficult to capture the whole of Seoul in the camera but one will leave with the memory that is hard to forget. Enthralling view! must visit. The entrance fee is slightly pricey but worth it.", September 2019
41,5.0,Great Klook Combo Deal!,"We bought our tickets on the app Klook and it was about $50 a person for the amazing combo deal for Lotte World, Lotte Tower and Lotte Aquarium! We noticed that for Lotte World and Lotte Tower alone the tickets for those single attractions were close to $45. We filled an entire day with these Lotte attractions and had so much fun! The Lotte World Tower was a highlight of our trip! We ate at the 123 Lounge on the 123rd floor, it was a little pricey but what you would expect for a high end bar/restaurant with a view like that! Lotte World was almost like a smaller disney with the restaurants, rides, indoor ice rink and gift shops. I can imagine this would be a great place for kids, but even as two adults we had a blast! We went on a Saturday so it was very crowded, I would suggest going on a school day because we saw one of the lines for a ride reached a 2 hour wait with a line that wrapped around the Magic Island zone. Other than that it was a pretty great experience!", September 2019
42,5.0,Fantastic views from 5th highest building in the world,"Amazing place, very fast lifts.. half a KM in the sky, what views.  The restaurant was amazing too.  Definitely the best site to see in Seoul.", September 2019

44,4.0,A Must See,"We were very surprised with our visit to Lotte Tower.  It felt like a Disney Ride rather than an observation point.  It was very well done with the modern technology available. We actually elevated faster than falling to thee earth without feeling anything but your ears popping. Also, who can resist having a cocktail at the highest bar in the world.", September 2019
45,4.0,Shopping heaven and instant tax refund ,"Shopping heavens. Just about anything you want. Best of all, instant refund with your purchase.  All you need is your passport. There are also many restaurants cater to your taste. We spent at least couple of hours here. Fantastic.", September 2019
46,5.0,Shopping Destination ,, August 2019
47,4.0,Mall with everything,"We love malls with easy transport access, range of shops which suit different pockets, large variety of restaurants/cafes for refuel and supermarket. Lotte World Mall hits all the right buttons. We spent half a day here and the supermarket was very well-stocked. There is also a floor of specially curated local restaurants which are famous in their regions for specific food. It was a great day for our group.", August 2019
48,5.0,Nice,"It’s a nice shopping mall. I didn’t go up the tower because in my opinion it was too expensive, I think it was like $27.", May 2019

50,3.0,Large modern mall!,Very large modern mall that is compromised by the towers above it. Has all the big brands but has a bit of an odd layout, April 2019
51,5.0,You can spend the whole day here!,"Great place for those who love shopping. Lots of shops and lovely cafes. Prices are different, a lot of sales. Losing track of time!", July 2019
52,4.0,a great viewing experience from Level 123,"I was in Seoul for business and we were invited by Lotte to tour the tower complex.  We went through a compelling video on the building of the tower and models of the site.  Then we took an exciting elevator ride to Level 117 and viewed the gronud from the glass bottomed viewing platform.  Finally, we went through all the floors ending on the restaurant on Level 123.  There are cafes and other amenities for families and the view is spectacular and well worth a visit", August 2019
53,5.0,So many things to do!!,, January 2019
54,5.0,Great Experience,The mall was really large and they offered things in a good price. The tower had a great view and I personally think it was better than the Petronas or Taipei., July 2019
55,4.0,Take your Wallet with you,, July 2019
56,5.0,Gigantic Mall,"Excellent place to visit if you want to spend the day shopping and sightseeing. Don’t miss the Library inside, perfect for Instagram pics. We didn’t go up to the Tower but heard the view is amazing.", July 2019

58,5.0,Walk around the lake,"Great view around the lake nearby lotte tower. The nearest toilets can be found on nearby restaurants.  Best view at the park on left side of lotte world facing lotte world from this picture. Use naver to navigate when commuting.  There are mopeds, scooters and bikes thru applications too if you want to go biking, it is located near bus stations, 500₩ / hr use.  You must install app first e.g.mobike", July 2019
59,5.0,Cool skyscraper in Gangnam,A very cool 555m tall skyscraper in Gangnam right next to Lotte World amusement park. The admission ticket was about 22.000 Won. Not too bad as we a free photo for every 4 ticket purchased. It's still a relatively new building. The superfast lift is lined with LCD screens that light up as we go up. Very cool and took less than a minute to the 118th floor. Once there go to the glass floor area and look down. What a great experience. Go to the 120 Floor to check out the outdoor area. You can see the whole of Seoul from up here. A great experience for the family., July 2019
60,3.0,Small amusement in the heart of city,Very crowded. You got to go thru a long line for any rides. All day pass is pricey but can’t ride enough due to long lines everywhere. You might want to pay more to get an express ticket to avoid lining., June 2019
61,5.0,Lotte World Tower ,"Room (88th floor) was well appointed with the expected amenities and very quiet with a great view of the city. Even the clouds couldn't dampen the mood. The staff were very kind and always super polite. There were no hiccups with the reservation, parking, or dining. The aquarium was nice for kids and the nearby shopping had all the top brands and the latest K-Pop paraphernalia. I had high expectations and they were met.", June 2019
62,5.0,Lotte World Mall & Park,"Huge Mall. Shopping, Food, Entertainment, Lotte World Adventure. Many restrooms/toilets. There is Park outside with a small lake (man-made?) where we stayed for an hour to relax. Accessible by subway train.", June 2019
63,3.0,Super expensive,"It's a luxury mall. Not the best mall. Personally, Singapore has better malls. It's just super hyped. You can skip it if you are a budget traveler", May 2019
64,4.0,Seoul’s Tallest Building!,, May 2019
65,5.0,Very expensive,"We went to find a specific store, Beanpole, and we bought some outfits there.  It's very expensive.  Customer service is unbeatable.  So many people just waiting to help you can be a bit overwhelming sometimes but it was very nice.", May 2019
66,4.0,Wonderful views of the city and the fastest elevator in the world.,The Lotte Tower is the 8th tallest building in the world at 486m and 125 stories. (For comparison the Burj Khalifa is 228 stories--almost twice as tall!) The elevator to the top rises 118 floors in one minute. The views are great! I would shoot for off-season and I like the views best at night. This is one of those places that easily gets jammed with tourists at the wrong time. The observation deck has a glass floor and just a net over the top to catch things falling from above. (What can fall from above at this height?) It would also be tremendous to see a fireworks display from up here. New Years Eve must be wild!, May 2019
67,4.0,You must visit this Tower,Being the 5th tallest building in the world this is well worth a visit. At the top of the Tower there is a glass floor allowing you to see all the way down. Bit pricey but worth it., February 2019

69,4.0,Huge shopping mall next to the highest building in Seoul,"Next and connected to Siegniel and the Siegniel Hotel, the highest building and the highest hotel in Seoul. A huge shopping mall that also near to the theme park, suitable for families with kids. Very crowded on weekends.", May 2019
70,5.0,Seems a bit empty at first but it's HUGE!,Great shopping mall overall! Lotte is one of the hallmark shopping malls/supermarkets in Korea. They have some of the most interesting shops and supermarkets there! I liked the video game shop a lot. But they don't have all those video games that you might think in North America. But the world tower is beautiful and bright! Will return there one day. It's pretty close to the Seoul Railway Station in which you will meet beggars around the underground., June 2018
71,5.0,Great Place for Window Shopping,"I was in Lotte World Tower for a movie premier. The place is conveniently located next to the train station, so had no problem to reach. It is huge and hosts many stores.", March 2019

77,5.0,Mini Disneyland in a Mall,We took our grandkids to Lotte World and couldn't believe how special this was...it is literally a mini-Disneyland within the mall.

78,5.0,Nice place 👌🏼👌🏼,"From my point of view this was one the most amazing views I’ve ever seen in my life, it’s an amazing experience descending more than 500mts into the fastest elevator over the earth.", March 2019
79,5.0,Highest point in Seoul - 360 degree view,"On a clear day you can see everything, because it is the only high building near and far. Finished 2 years ago it is the ultimate land mark. A modern elevator brings you up quickly, then you have various viewing platforms, also glass floor to look all the way down. You better love hights!", April 2019
80,5.0,Wonderful,This wonderful place to shop or spend your evening strolling around at the lake just outside the mall. Blessed with good weather and cherry blossom last week. To get here was easy with the subway., April 2019
81,5.0,Night view is a must see,"At $27 per person it was a pretty costly trip atop the world's 5th tallest structure but worth it for the night view. Went up just before it turned dark so got a view of the city in the daylight but it's the night time when the city really shines. Photos are  tricky during the day because the external water stains are awful and at night there's the light reflecting off the glass in some places but with 360 viewing you're bound to capture a few great shots. Note there is an airport type security check before heading into the elevators. I didn't have anything of note but not sure what you'd do if you have something not allowed up. Inside the elevator the ceiling and walls light up with an amazing show as if you're flying into space. On the ride down there is a fireworks show on the ceiling and walls. Unbelievably fast ride considering the trip up 120+ floors. Don t go if you're claustrophobic,  people are crammed in, but very short trip - felt like 30 seconds - so not too bad.", April 2019

86,3.0,"Crowded, but still interesting with something for all ages.","This time my kids stuck me in a wheelchair, dicky knees from arthritis. It was a free wheelchair hire. Everything was easily accessible. It was incredibly busy though, The average wait time for a ride was 180 mins!!!! It was a special day though, if you dressed in a school uniform then you got in half price. So, uniforms everywhere. Staff were great though and I went on a few rides. Sometimes even managed to cut a line with my helper. There were still steps to climb though, which the staff were happy to help me with. Beautiful at night due to the lights. A nice way to spend an afternoon evening.", February 2019

It takes about 1.5 hours to 2 hours waiting in the queue per ride.... I didn't get to do much... only a couple.

95,4.0,Lotte Tower experience for our family,"Our American family of five, kids ages 10, 13 and 16, visited the Lotte Tower with a native South Korean. It was very nice to have our friend there, but his interpretation skills were really not necessary. We were not there to go shopping, but rather to have the Sky Tower experience. The cue area was empty for our morning visit, but if you had to stand in line, there are interesting things to look at while you wind yourself through the maze. The elevator is filled with tv screens and the ride up is amazing and beautiful. It stops near the very top and then visitors can take their time in visiting each of the floors, until they reach the very top, the 123rd floor, which consists of an expensive restaurant/lounge. Be sure to go on a relatively clear day, because you will be able to see for kilometers. Regardless of the weather, throughout much of the year the ""very fine dust that blows over from Eastern China"" obscures the view. We all liked the clear floor, so we could see straight down to the ground below. As an American from the suburbs it is impressive to see the hundreds and hundreds of apartment buildings that house the majority of South Korea's population. This was a very different experience from the Seoul Tower, which honestly I preferred. However, had we visited the Lotte Tower before the Seoul Tower, we would have been unimpressed because it has fewer stories, so the view wasn't quite as impressive.", June 2018

107,3.0,I think it all depends on your expectations,"The experience of riding the tower felt sort of like a ride at Disney, there are a lot of distractions to help pass the time while waiting in line.  The views at the top are impressive, and the glass floor gives some great photo opportunities.  Basically, though, it you have been to a tower at any other city, this is similar.  One can easily come away thinking that you might have overpaid for an attraction.  You can tell that the S Korean people (full disclosure: I'm Korean), are very proud of this architectural achievement, so that is where I put my mainframe when visiting this place.", December 2018

Once you are up you can stay as long as you want though, so we went up before the sun set to see the city in the daylight and then we watched the sunset and saw the city lights. There are multiple floors when you get up: one with a glass floor and another with an outdoor area, so there is lots to see and from different viewpoints. It was extremely well organized and staff very professional and polite. The view was incredible, you can see for very far over the city and the river. Just make sure to go on a clear day.

129,4.0,Huge shopping mall with impressive cinema complex,I found myself inadvertently exploring this huge mall as I tried to find the cinema complex which was on various floors in the main building of the mall. I was under a bit of time pressure so I didn't fully explore the full extent of the shops in the mall. But there certainly seemed to be a plethora of high end branded shops and stores as well as more than enough places to eat and drink. No doubt a compulsive shopper would have a field day here.

It also shows you what floor you're in and how many meters you're up above the ground!! OMG! I love the views, the gift shops, and the restaurants up the Tower.  The restaurants are a little pricey though lol! Go during the day or night, you will definitely have plenty of picturesque view of the city underneath you! There's also a place where you can go outside and experience a nice breeze! It was really nice! Go and check it out for yourself!

173,5.0,LOTTE WORLD TOWER + SEOUL kOREA = A PERFECT 10,"There is an expression, “You’ll know it when you see it”.  It could also be said, “You’ll know it when you feel it”.  From the second we entered the Lotte World Tower, a sensation came over me as I looked up at the endless high ceiling.  Before I go any further let me state, for you to truly experience this magnificent hotel you should have the option to experience the elements of surprise.    Therefore, I will present only basic facts enough to peak your interest without giving away all the unique features you will experience. If you were to google a map of Seoul the most obvious feature you will notice is a building towering above all other structures.  The Lotte World Tower is the tallest building in South Korea, reaching 123 floors at a height of 1,819 feet.  It is the fifth tallest building in the world. Just for the record, our room number was 9882! That is correct the 98th Floor!  The view was breathtaking and certainly the highest floor we have had the pleasure of staying for the night. The hotel is connected to the Lotte World Mall. The Mall is exceptionally large, modern and beautiful offering a host of famous brand names with numerous places to eat with a variety of delicacies from around the world.  In the basement of the hotel is an outstanding Aquarium truly worth visiting.  Their specious lounge, is a place we frequently visited to relax and enjoy the panoramic view of the city located on the 79th floor.  There is an outstanding observation deck located on the 123-floor overlooking the city. From our room we could see the river that was incredible especially when watching the city lights at night. The hotel of course offers all the amenities found only in the top luxury hotels. Wait until you see your uniquely designed room especially the bathroom!  I highly recommend you take advantage of their outstanding breakfast.  Everything is fresh and with a variety of choices that are professionally served.  My suggestion is order their smoothie, the combinations of taste is exceptionally delicious.  Of all the highlights offered by any hotel it always comes down to the quality of service by the staff. Having travelled around the world the personnel at the Signiel hotel we would rate above outstanding. Their kindness and efficiency is second to none and they make you feel right at home. We consider the whole complex a “City within a city”. Seoul has hundreds of top end hotels to choose from but, if you want to truly experience something from a fancy world, the choice is obvious. It certainly captured our hearts the moment the doors were open.  On a personal note, when visiting a new hotel, I always make a concretive effort to try and find flaws.  Paying particularly attention to the smallest details to challenge their efforts to put their best foot forward. I can honestly say without hesitation; this hotel is truly a Perfect 10!", June 2018
174,5.0,Future World,"On my last evening in Seoul , I saw this amazing building from my hotel room ! Nobody had told me about it , so I arranged to go by taxi and was invited by a Korean friend to visit The Signiel hotel . This building is stunning . I was staggered by the scale of it and from a distance it has a kind of timeless futurist design . As we approached it by taxi , it was dusk and the dynamic lighting of the complex at the foot of this mountain of a building was very state of the art ... we went up to the top floors of the viewing tower . And the video installations in the corridors were breathtaking . The elevator has 360 video art which distracts from the fact that we rise 101 floors in 60 seconds .. the views from the top at night are the pride of modern South Korean life !! Seoul looks like a perfect Eutopia from this viewpoint . The Signiel Hotel is also like stepping into a SF movie .. mega expensive, but worth it !!", June 2018

Seokchon Lake in front of it is very beautiful in early April, with flourishing cherry blossoms. The lake is romantic at night with lakeside lights. The lake is sort of divided into two sections, separated by a bridge, but one could walk around the whole lake along the walkway. It is somewhat confusion trying to get to the lake, but I usually choose to either get out from Exit 2 of Jamsil metro station or from Exit 14 of Lotte World Tower.", April 2018
