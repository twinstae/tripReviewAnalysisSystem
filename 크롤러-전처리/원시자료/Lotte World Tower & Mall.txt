3,3.0,The ventilation needs improvement,The night view was average. There were probably too many people.  It was like queuing for an amusement ride.

6,3.0,A great view on a clear day ,"I enjoyed the view of Seoul, but given the sometimes foggy/smoggy local air you need to pick a good day to visit.

8,5.0,Amazing is an understatement,The Lotte World Tower is an astounding architectural achievement! Standing on a glass floor at 119 stories above the ground is scary as heck!

11,4.0,Fun place,The Mall is typical with boutique and restaurants with reasonable prices.   Had visited the Lotte World Adventure with our DISCOVER Seoul Pass.
