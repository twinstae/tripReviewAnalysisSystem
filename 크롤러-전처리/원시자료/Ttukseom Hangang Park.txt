4,5.0,A break from the rush,"A must if you're in Seoul! Especially if it's hot outside, the Han river is really cooling and beautiful during a hot summer day.

The only things lacking are venues to eat at. You only have two options: a convenience store or a chicken and beer restaurant in a ship on the river.", July 2015
