0,5.0,Each section is well-maintained to bring visitor's interest,"This is the memorial hall for An Junggeun who assassinated Japanese governor.They seemed to try hard to attract visitors with various methods. I think you'll have a wonderful time in this tiny hall.Location:This hall is locating between Baekbeom Park and Namsan Library. Close from the southern trail entrance of Namsan which is also the bus route.The entrance of the building is a bit tricky. Visitors have to circle around from the front wall to the gate.- 30 ~ 60 min to watch slowly.- The location is not on the point where many people pass. This is mostly not crowded.- There is a garden of rocks before the building. It's also nice area to relax watching scripts on them.- During cherry blossom season, I recommend accessing from drive-in way of Namsan Library. There are beautiful cherry blossoms and it's good to walk.", May 2018
1,5.0,"Touching memorial hall of Ahn Jung Geun in Seoul, South Korea","This is a very touching museum dedicated to the life of an important Korean martyr who opposed the Japanese rule on the peninsula and ended up killing the Japanese price ruling over Korea. It is a testimony of the struggle of the oppressed people and symbolizes the will of Korea to be free and be ready for anything to reach its independence. I confess that, before visiting this place, I did not know anything about Ahn Jung Geun, but when I got out of the museum I felt quite emotional.  His life is narrated as a story of strong belief and resistance until martyrdom. Many parts and panels are in Korean only, but the friendly lady at the entrance and a man who we met on the second floor were very helpful. In particular he gave us a small book in English about his life and pictures. If you can, add this museum to your list of place to visit in Seoul.", October 2016
