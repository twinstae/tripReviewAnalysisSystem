0,5.0,"10,000 steps a day - guaranteed","Coex Seoul is a massive, cavernous conference center situated on the south side of the Han River. Underneath is Stanfield", September 2019
1,5.0,Nice mall with many selections,A bit far from Center seoul. But it offers many shops selections and korean brands. Reasonable prices as well., December 2019
2,4.0,Excellent Facility ,The business I had in Seoul was at the World Trade Center Seoul located at the COEX so I was there everyday for 10 days and visited every facility located there.I’m particularly impressed with the Airline check in available there though it’s restricted in terms of airlines served. The Underground Starfield Mall is impressive and offers a wide range of shopping opportunities. There’s a good library located within the Mall. The Bongeunsa Temple is located just opposite the Mall. There’s also the “Gangnam Style Hand” that offers a great photo opportunity. It’s definitely worth a visit, November 2019
3,5.0,"Great Mall,  AIRLINE CHECK IN COUNTER,","The best thing for me at Co-EX is the airline check in counter.  Drag your baggage to the airport check in annex at Co-Ex.  Done.  You get a boarding pass, get rid of your baggage - all you have to do is drag your a** to the airport and off you go.This the most convenient thing I've ever seen in my life.Make sure you have ample time on the weekends if you intend to take a taxi, limousine bus, or friend driving to Inchon or Gimpo - traffic out of Gangnam area could get interesting - consider taking the train (subway).The mall has numerous eateries, and department stores.  You can spend days there (which we did).  Various attractions have their own reviews, so scan through them.  You can easily find the gems in those reviews.", September 2019
4,4.0,Center for all,"Aquarium, shopping, temple, cinema, library, food centre, Sky Garden, exhibition hall, hotels, restaurants and so much more. No wonder this is a meeting place for all as you can just about do all things here. We spend almost the whole day here, shopping, dining and of course taking photos.", September 2019
5,4.0,Worth Spending Half Day for Shopping or Eating ,"It's a very large complex with international brands of shops, Hyundai department store with supermarket, library, restaurants, cinema, five-star hotel (Intercontinental), conference centre, aquarium, food court, City Air Terminal that can do flight check-in. Our itinerary of that day was to have a fabulous seafood lunch in Garak seafood market (metro station #817), then took 6 stops to Samseong station (#219) where COEX mall is located, strolled around for a few hours, bought some food in supermarket before taking a taxi at Intercontinental Hotel back to our hotel apartment in city centre. Very enjoyable and convenient. Worth spending half day here. A cozy and clean mall.", July 2019
6,4.0,Large impressive centre,I came here for a conference and was impressed with its size. Loads of large rooms inside used for conferences - they had about 3 on when I was there each occupying a large room and several other spaces. There’s a multitude of restaurants and places to get food. I believe they have an underground mall as well. Really clean and well kept., June 2019
7,5.0,In the center of it all,"This venue was very near the hotel I stayed in while visiting Seoul last year. I found it a bit hard to imagine that a mall is sharing the same building as that of the convention center. Despite of its huge size, I found it easy to explore this place, wherein I got lost looking for the convention center. I managed to find it after about 3 minutes - I realized one has to take about 2 floors up to find the convention center as the street level of this place is the mall.      After that small incident, I found it easy to navigate this place and marveled at how this building has varied designs and architecture. I especially like the garden design I saw in one part of this place.", October 2018
8,4.0,Worth the visit,"I wasn’t sure what to find, and after visiting thru I can tell you that the artistic side of it is great!Sculptures, the World Trade Center buildings, hotels, restaurants and the Hyundai shopping mall, makes a big complex to be discovered.", February 2019
9,5.0,Big landmark in Seul,"Coex complex is one of the most popular tourist destination located in downtown area of Seoul. Asia's biggest underground shopping mall (Coex Mall), Duty-free shop, Department Store, Casino, Book Store, Kimchi Musem, Traditional Buddist Temple, Cinema, Musical Theater and other facilities and amenities designed to provide memorable tourist experience are all located in one place, Intercontinental Seul is adjacent to Coex complex .", September 2018
10,3.0,Remodeled and huge,I lived in Seoul for five years and went back to visit after eight years away. The Coex Mall has been remodeled and it is overwhelming. I'm sure Koreans love to go here but it was too confusing for a short visit., November 2018
11,3.0,Ok for a visit,It is worth to visit. There are lots of shops. If you are in search for a place with more reasonably priced items. This place is not for you., September 2018
12,4.0,"Big Mall, Library in a mall","5 more hours for the driver to arrive for the airport from Gangnam. Took the subway to COEX.nice cafe ""mamas"" at the entrance of the subway which led to the mall.Eateries are aplenty, but prices are definitely upmarket though not expensive per se.The Aquarium and a couple of Korean popstars exhibits and themed museum are all within the huge building, co-joining the exhibition halls, as well as the Hotel Inter-continental.A good walk for 2-3hra is recommended, esp if the outdoors too hot, or raining.", October 2018
13,5.0,Great Shopping,"The Coex is an exhibition and shopping centre. The stores range from top end retailers to department stores along with restaurants, a library and movie cinemas. It is a large centre with kids activities like LEGO playland and cafe at Brick Live. There is an aquarium and many hotels that surround and have entry into the shopping mall. There is also an airport check in if you fly certain airlines eg. Korean airlines or Thai, you can check bags in like you do at the airport. An airport bus leaves every 20 mins and you book tickets an hour before you want to leave. Price for the bus is 15000 won each adult, cheaper for children. Clothing prices aren’t cheap and if you want discounted clothing you need to go to the outlet shops. There are lots of coffee shops where you can buy food and beverages for around similar prices toAustralia. The library is big with floor to roof bookshelves and many Koreans come here to just read. A great place to visit.", September 2018
14,4.0,Great Big Mall,Huge Mall next door to the convention centre. Not too many great pr extraordinary shopping options though. very standard mall affair. good if you are staying next door hotels, October 2017
15,5.0,Lots of Books,A very unique mall that full of books. You can read books here or taking a few photo of this incredible mall. Worth a visit., March 2018
16,3.0,Cool to look around ,It’s a mall but it’s big and pretty much has anything you would want to do including a theatre and an aquarium. Lots of tasty places to eat it at and of course who could forget the Gangnam Statue outside!! Also the library is pretty fantastic to stop at., February 2018
17,4.0,A Massive Mall,"COEX is a huge underground mall, ideal for a whole day excursion. It had hundreds of restaurants and shops, as well as an elaborate movie theater, a library, and an aquarium. We recommend COEX for folks living abroad in South Korea or people on long vacations, but it isn't something you need to see if you're passing through. It's next door to a lovely Buddhist temple. Be prepared to pay a little higher prices than elsewhere in Korea - it is a mall, and it's in the heart of Gangnam. It is the nicest underground mall we've ever been to, though!", December 2017
18,5.0,Giant shopping mall ,"Giant shopping mall with various shops and pretty much anything one might want to find. Library, playgrounds, food, clothing and all the rest of things....", October 2017
19,3.0,Cool underground shopping mall,"We stayed at the COEX hotel so we took a trip underground to the shopping center. Cool gift shops and strange food, but otherwise just another shopping mall. I attached some photos", December 2016
20,1.0,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ,"This place is not worth it at all! First, it's very far from Seoul's center so you'll stay in subway for awhile. Second, it is so misleading I could not find that ""many"" shops everyone talking about. I found some shops you can count on your hands. Too many restaurants, not sure this place for eating or shopping. Even the material and designs of many shops SUCKS!! We barely found anything to buy. And when we decided to eat, the restaurants started to close. We only went their because of the Bongeunsa Temple that was across of the mall, too bad the sun went down before we reached + there were constructions there so we headed directly to the mall and it is complete waste of time with no shops to actually shop.", September 2017
21,4.0,Huge convention center with food and shops,This convention center is huge and you could easily get lost if you are not careful. The food and shops can be pretty pricey though so be prepared to spend a little more if you intend to eat/shop while you are there., August 2017
22,2.0,Changes ... for the worst,"We visited this place multiple in the past and after the last round of renovations few years back, we decided to re-visit this time round.Besides the aquarium, this used to be a location of variety of small and large shops, food and items you can find probably elsewhere can be found here.It is now a glam map, with numerous ""anchor"" style stores but an empty feeling like ""just another mall - just larger"".A pity the renovation went the other way.", May 2017
23,2.0,Disappointing,I heard a lot about the COEX mall beforehand and travelled a fair distance on metro to see it for myself. Disappointed. Just a big mall with an aquarium in it., June 2016
24,4.0,Food + Shopping,"Here you have everything in one place: delicious food (authentic Korean) and endless shopping for affordable brands.If you are a tourist, remember to request the tax free purchases!", April 2017

26,4.0,Great center!!,"Well if you are in the neighbourhood.. yea sure look in you'll find an aquarium, great cinema Megabox, loads of shopping Centers and food places. It's a high end place where prices are a bit high. So it's not an absolute waste but if I have to choose I would go to Lotte World much more fun.", March 2017
27,3.0,High end shopping center,"This is Korea's largest exhibition venue, many exhibition halls, a convention center and meeting rooms. There are other additional facilities, including a hotel, casino, underground shopping mall, museums and an aquarium. Subway Line 2, Samseong Station", October 2016
28,4.0,All in one shopping experience at Coex Center,"There is a post office, Intercontinental Hotel, shops and food court...etc inside Coex and I was there by subway. Stayed warm with the indoor shopping.", February 2017
29,3.0,Shopping and Dining,"Coex has been renovated a few years ago and now I have mixed feelings. In the past, it was way easier to navigate around and shop while avoiding the hot or cold weather outside. I like how it is much cleaner and modern but the layout is much more confusing than it used to be. The first time I visited after renovation, I couldn't find my friend because it was like a maze! We stayed for a bit to look around and when it was time to pick a place to dine...we gave up and just left to go somewhere else. There were many options but we got exhausted from walking around. They have cool shops and it is a great place to hang out but I guess you would really have to know how to get around. I'm planning to visit again so we'll see if I get lost this time. LOL", April 2016
30,2.0,expensive labyrinth,"Wear walking shoes and be prepared to get lost and be told by the information to go in clock directions.   Go straight at one o'clock for your escalator. It's been bought over by Shinsegae group and renamed the Starfield COEX but still an awful concept in planning. You need to spend 50,000 won to get an hour of parking.   It's hard to do that between two people for just food... Hyundai department store purchases don't count either.  Just an expensive mess.", December 2016
31,2.0,Worse than IKEA for getting lost,"I have been to a lot of large malls in my time, including the Dubai Mall, but this labyrinth is a confusing hodge podge of hallways lined with stores, without any apparent structure or thought given to it. It is worse than IKEA for getting lost. The food court is a joke and embarrasingly small for such a large mall. Even when we gave up trying to find the store we wanted, which was so clearly marked on the info screens, we could not easily find a stinking exit out of the place. Of course there are lots of exits but they are not clearly marked and we contemplated using an emergency exit just to get the hell out. Heaven forbid should an evacuation ever be necessary. Unless you are being forced by the wife or girlfriend, I would highly recommend skipping this place. My god, Seoul is just full of shopping malls, there is nothing special here to draw you in, and wandering aimlessly in this maze just made me aggressive. Avoid Avoid Avoid!", October 2016
32,2.0,confusing as hello,really confusing to walk around this place. nice shops just confusing though. really easy to get to. large movie theater near by as well., April 2016
33,4.0,Very nice shopping centre,"Great place to eat, shop and soak up the Korean atmosphere and hospitality.  Certainly worthy of a visit", June 2016
34,3.0,"Huge, confusing convention center","Although this convention center is shiny clean and well-located near the Seoul Station City Airport Terminal, where one can take an express bus from the international airport and even check-in on your departure day, I found its whole layout of the Coex convention center to be terribly confusing. My co-convention attenders were similarly confused and often lost, and often late to meeting sessions. Except for individual meeting rooms, the main building was HOT and very poorly air conditioned. I realize that the cost to keep it cool is high, but this was only June. I can only imagine how convention-goers suffer when it gets even hotter. Signs are poorly marked and the huge place only has a couple of 'help' desks where staff speak poor English. A plus is that there is a huge shopping and food mall located underneath the convention center. Of course, the goods are all international; with the exception of the food and perhaps tea for gifting to family and friends at home, it is not a shopping destination for Americans or others who are looking for something special that characterizes their experience in Korea. There are many high priced hotels nearby or  attached to the center. Good for avoiding the frequent rains in summer. Despite a few pluses, the overwhelming scope of and poor signage within COEX  makes me caution organizers of other large, international meetings, before selecting this location.", June 2016
35,5.0,nice,alot of famous shops and restaurant  near grand intercontinental hotel recommend to go there and enjoy, May 2016
36,3.0,All in all mall ,"You have everything there including a 5 star hotel, all restaurants, conference centre, shops, aquarium and movie hall. Located at Samseong metro station on green line. Another metro station on new line 9 also is close.Opposite to this COEX centre, there is a good and famous Buddhist temple. A must visit place...", May 2016
37,3.0,ok,"Coex Center is a huge complex in Gangnam Area. Visited with other attractions in the area such as the  temple, SM Building. This is one of the stops of the bus hop on hop off.", March 2016
38,5.0,Nice experience,wide range of fish and creatures of display. really was an excellent experience. traveled log time back in dec 2011, June 2015
39,3.0,the ordinary multi complex,huge but not really convenient to roam around-many choices available to dine though-hot for K-POP fans to visit their idols at the SM museum nearby-, May 2016
40,4.0,Superb neighborhood,Aside from the Coex Mall that I think was just average in terms of the shops. The Neighborhood of the Coex center itself is such a fun and awesome area to be with. Located in Gangnam-gu. Do visit for photo opt., April 2016
41,4.0,Nice,"This is a really nice convention center, sort of in the middle of everything south of the river. It's got some nice features, but the location is really what stood out to me.", February 2016
42,3.0,"Shopping,Aquarium all at one place.","Takes a day to complete to roam around the place.Aquarium is one of the best.Design of building.Shopping Mall etc.,", April 2015
43,4.0,Not only shopping,"Although COEX is a large mall one can find other things to see and visit as we did. We knew about the flower exhibition there and it was worth visiting...well, that exhibition is not there all the time but Aquarium will be. Admission fee to aquarium is high but you will see a lot of sea creatures in normal but also in some crazy tanks.", October 2015
44,5.0,Shopping paradise,This place is an shopping paradise for the first timers like me. So many choices and so warm people. I bought lot of souvenirs and toys and chocolates for kids. There are so many awesome eateries inside. You can spend your entire day here easily., May 2015
45,4.0,Huge,"You can easily go COEX in Seoul. It has a lot of shopping center, and the aquarium is must visit place.", January 2015
46,3.0,You might like it,"My self didnt like it that much, although it has lots of choices but i didnt like it. If you have kids with you and they are active, dont go there because they might waste your time just observing them not to be lost", August 2015
47,3.0,"It's a nice place to shop, but can be confusing","The nice thing is that they have a variety of shops. However it's for middle-upper class citizens; it's something I'd see in malls in Jakarta and sometimes shop at, but not when I'm traveling due to baggage weight or budget. This place is both a mall and convention center, but I mostly saw only the mall-- saw SMTOWN exhibition hall/convention center from the outside but didn't go in. The mall... was confusing even with maps. The reason I'm giving this a 3 star is because it's confusing for a first-time visitor although the place is very nice. I'm a very bad map reader, and the signages sometimes didn't really help. Me and my mom wanted to go to the MRT (line 2 I think) and halfway through, the signage disappeared :( thankfully we took a map before going inside, and that my mom can read maps much better than I do. If I was alone, I'd definitely get lost several times. Confusing places will no longer be confusing after you visit and stroll around a few times, but as a traveler, you don't always have the time. I'd rather get lost in the streets rather than a mall xD", July 2015
48,4.0,Great Convention Center,The COEX center is a large convention center. If you're in Seoul you should check out the COEX schedule for conventions. They had an outdoor apparel exhibit while I was there. The grounds are nice and have some cool photo ops., February 2015
49,4.0,Good relaxed shopping,"The Coex shopping mall is a good place for shopping. You can find anything from interior to fancy clothes. If you want to eat, breakfast, lunch or dinner then you can do this as well. You can easily take the subway to this place (line 2).The Coex mall is located in the Gingham area and with direct access to two Intercontinental hotels by elevator.", January 2015
50,3.0,"It's a convention center, nothing more.","This is a huge convention center, which is attached to the incomplete COEX Mall and to the Intercontinental COEX hotel.While the center's convention facilities are nice, there's nothing too unique about it, as it lacks a bit of character.Still, worth a short visit if you are in the Gangnam area.", July 2014
51,5.0,A Huge Convention Center,"It's a very large complex which includes hotels, a shopping mall, an aquarium and of course the convention & exhibition center which can accommodate several international conferences simultaneously. Because of its sheer size, it's quite a challenge to walk from one end to the other. I wish there were some kind of transport inside the building itself!", October 2014
52,4.0,Great Evening Spot To Relax After Shopping the COEX Mall,"My spouse & I visited the COEX Center in the early evening.  There was a very nice breeze, lots of couples & families out spending a nice relaxing Sunday evening together.  There are plenty of seating areas to find a place to rest your feet.  Atmosphere:There are rectangular buildings that have what looks like piano keys on the sides if these buildings. While we were there, there was a water & light display.  Nothing spectacular - however, with Billy Joel, ""The Piano Man"" playing, it was a very nice setting for both couples, & families.  This is not somewhere to visit for hours on end. However, it is nice, especially if you have a special one, and/or family to share time with here.  Recommendation:  YES.  {plan according to weather, for outside time}Suggestion:  If you are going to the COEX Mall, or MegaBox Cineplex anyway, this is are fantastic stop to make, as long as it is NOT in the Heat of mid-day Summer.", July 2014
53,4.0,Great Shopping and Aquarium.,"This is a huge shopping center, more like something you could find in North America. There is a giant movie theatre and a great aquarium along with lots of clothing stores and small places to eat. If you enjoy mall type shopping this would be worth a visit but it isn't a must see as it just like a lot of American shopping malls.", June 2013
54,3.0,"If you like shopping, this is for you","If you have kids and love shopping, this is a great venue for both of you. The aquarium is right there, as are games and food courts .", September 2013
55,3.0,Usual exhibition center,"The center is big. But overall very similar to other exhibition center. It has Wifi but with difficulty to get connected sometime, especially during peak hour and the speed is a bit slow. The COEX mall at underfloor was closed for renovation during my visit. So can just stayed inside if feel bored during meeting.", September 2013
56,3.0,Nothing special,"Its just a place where you can find everything. Like a central place kinda thing but then there is a lot of walking involved, unlike other countries.", September 2013
57,5.0,Amazing,The conference I attended was in Coex center which also has a mall in the basement. One can spend a whole day loitering around in this place and it is bang in the middle of the city where all the action is., June 2013
58,3.0,Nothing special,The mall was on havey renovation but from the stores i saw it was nothing special. There are much better streens in gangdum to visit, June 2013
59,2.0,Check if renovation work is done here,"The whole mall seems to be under renovation when we went in May 2013...Just checked to ensure the renovation is done before heading there...All that we saw was the COEX aquarium, Cinema, Burger King and some few remaining stores.", May 2013
60,4.0,What to do at COEX.,"You can check the website and go to any of the ""events"" from wine tasting, scotch tasting, to baby good conventions.  Or you can head to the mall and aquarium and spend time with the family.  Eat at the nearby food court at Hyundai mall.  Watch a movie,  They even have events outdoors at some times.", May 2013
61,4.0,Just a posh mall,Visited this place with friends on a weekend evening. This is nothing more than giant mall. Nothing much to do here other than do window shopping. Note that the prices are exorbitant and you would be better off buying the same product in some other place for a more reasonable amount., June 2012
62,2.0,There's better elsewhere,"COEX isn't very interesting but it is being refurbished - presumably back to its former glory. The Kim Chi museum is good but max 20 mins. The kind of place you go one to say you've been.Try the massive Times Square shopping complex off Yeongdeungpo station instead,it's so much better. It's huge, has all kinds of shops at every price level, an amazing food court and department store galore.", May 2013
63,1.0,mall of shame!,"for me, its just a very boring mall with not much in it. we wandered around and then ate some very basic food, and left. Not at all exciting after all the hype about it being one of the biggest malls. Very disappointing", March 2013
64,5.0,Biggest 'mall' in Korea,"'Everything under one roof' is not a common concept in Korea (it's more often 'everything similar on one street' as in the Wedding, Pet, and Car Rows of Seoul), but COEX carries it off in a dramatic, labyrinthian, bright urban jungle style.  Make sure to orient yourself and your party before you venture in, and if you separate, look for the Bandi and Lund's bookstore or some similar landmark to rendezvous at.  Machetes not required but good footwear advised.  Fantastic choices for food, some great stores, lots of eye candy - a great 'rainy day' adventure", October 2012
65,4.0,Shopping with nice buildings,"Really impressive and different looking buildings in the area including Lotte and Lucky 7 Casino, along with more traditional areas like Bongeunsa.", December 2012

67,3.0,Just a Large Mall,"COEX is very large, but it is just a mall with Food Courts, Restaurants, Shopping and a Movie Theater. It was a bit difficult in getting around.", August 2012
68,4.0,All in one place,"If you happen to visit Seoul during rainy season and look for a place to spend the day in shade, COEX is it. You can have almost everything there. There are many restaurants where you can enjoy traditional Korean foods, to western style foods and many Asian restaurants as well. After the meal, you can spend your time in theater, aquarium, or shopping area. All's under one roof.", June 2012
69,4.0,need more time!,really BIG.Many varietiesThe kimchi museum charged 3000 won but it is very small and not worth going.Hyundai shopping center-a very big department store.Many cometics shops.Many shops for different cuisines.No supermarkets.Only 7-11 shopFree wifi at Mcdonald shop., April 2012
70,4.0,The biggest shopping mall in Asia Pacific,"it is complex mall and quite spacious place. you can also find 16 halls mega cinema, big department store, big bookstore, many shops where you buy everything, full of resto, cafeteria. mall is basement, 1st floor is exhibition halls. you can also have a look at those exhibitions.", April 2012

72,5.0,Great for shopping and people watching,"Coex is a great mall with hotels and a casino attached or close by. It has a great selection of places to eat and shop. There is an aquarium and cinema also for those who are interested in that. Very busy on weekends,but much more relaxing during the week.", March 2012
73,4.0,Everything under one roof,"This is a huge complex comprising of offices, eateries and retail outlets.The food at the food court is pretty okay and price is slightly more expensive. Some eateries in COEX is pretty reasonably priced given the portion served.There is a huge bookshop called Bundi and Lund which is worth checking out. Korean books mostly but there is a good selection of English books and magazines as well. A place to get some stationery as well.You may catch a movie at the cinema in the mall or pop by the aquarium. The place is properly signed, so no worries about getting lost. Information boards are all around.", October 2011
