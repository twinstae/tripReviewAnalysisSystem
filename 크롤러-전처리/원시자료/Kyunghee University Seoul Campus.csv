0,4.0,Beautiful buildings,A bit far from the city center. Nice view during spring season. This place is less crowded compared to Ewha University but might also because of we went there in the morning. Suggested to go early morning to avoid crowd., April 2019
1,2.0,"Not worth the visit, except for cherry-blossom season","The buildings in the campus are beautiful but in terms of architecture, they are only mocking renaissance-style, like those you would see at the amusement parks. But this campus is packed with visitors during the cherry blossom season. Located a little far from the center. If you are in a tight schedule, I do not see why you must visit this place.", October 2018
2,3.0,Kyunghee University Hall,"It is an European church style building outside but inside more of a theatre hall. There are two floors, first floor bigger with a stage in the front middle, second floor half size the first floor. Toilets are in each side of hall....left for ladys and right for gents. Parking space outside quit big enough for tens of buses.", July 2018
3,4.0,Good scenery on spring and autum,"The campus has a really nice view on spring and autumn. Not only the students, everyone can come here to enjoy the scenery, take photos (even the pre wedding photos), or picnic with friends. The only disappointment is that there were too many people on spring and autumn so I couldn’t enjoy the scenery.", April 2018
4,4.0,"Worth of visit, especially when semester is started","Campus is stunningly beautiful at cherry blossom time! Apart of that buildings itself and area are nice to explore. Main adventure is definitely Korean students, how they live their university life:)", April 2018
5,4.0,Great cherry blossom scenery among nice archetecture,"It's a great place to see tons of cherry blossom among many nice architecture buildings around the campus.

6,3.0,What planet is this place on?,"This campus has a weird, eclectic mix of architectural styles. There is almost every style of large classical, university-style Western building all jammed into one space. Walk past all of these places and BOOM there is a replica of Notre Dame. Sacre bleu!", January 2018
7,3.0,Better to visit here during Spring,"One of my friends attended school here so I decided to come here for a look. The campus was surrounded by trees and I had a nice walk around the campus. The architecture for two of the buildings were impressive. Overall, the campus is ok. I think visiting during Spring will be better since you can look at cherry blossoms as well.", May 2017
8,5.0,Good architecture,"At first i thought I just touchdown the Whitehouse of USA. But it was just a main building of this university.

He graduated from this university lol", May 2017
9,4.0,One of the best place to see Cherry Blossom,"Kyunghee University is famous for viewing Cherry Blossom.  We went on a weekday, already seen tour group and local grade students  tour chinning for the Cherry blossom viewing.  Nice campus.  Cherry blossom is nice too. Another place for cherry blossom is Nami island and park near Gimpo airport too.", April 2017

12,3.0,Kyunghee University ,"I wet to this university on weekend ,there were not many people here just some pre-college students like me.I walked around in the campus and took a look with the sight.As a famous university in South Korea,Kyunghee University is not good like it's reputation.Bulidings are little old and the campus is little dirty too.With a normal library,this kyunghee such like a normal school,the biggest difference may be is Kyunghee university has it's own kindergarten and middle school.Anyway you can study here but without much excellent things.", November 2015
