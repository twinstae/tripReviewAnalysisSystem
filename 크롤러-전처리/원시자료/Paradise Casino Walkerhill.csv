0,1.0,Bad reviews are true. Paid the price.,"Paid the price of losing to learn through the hard way. This place is designed for you to lose. This casino is not big at all. If you want maximum fun and win some money, go to Singapore's Resort World or Marina Bay Sands. They are 10 times bigger.  1) Minimum bet for Blackjack", November 2019
1,5.0,Very Happy.,This Hotel and Casino is by far the best we stayed at on our visit to Seoul. The hotel is amazing and massive. The staff were lovely and the rooms were perfect. This place is like its own city with many things to see and do all in one place.We loved it. Thank You, September 2019
2,2.0,"Small, smokey, full of rude Chinese nationals","I went last night with the intention of playing low buy-in blackjack, not only did I not get to play blackjack because there was an entire family of Chinese nationals who would call someone over to hold the seat when ever anyone left FOR HOURS, when I finally decided to play poker the other guests (again all Chinese nationals) were very rude and making cusses at me all night. The place itself is alright, very small with few low value tables operating, the staff were reasonable civil and provided free water when requested, but the room smelt strongly of smoke due to the smoko rooms at ether end which were regularly opened into the main area. I guess its better than nothing, but I will not be going back.", August 2019
3,1.0,Female dealers are very rude and gossipy,"Female dealers were Extremely unprofessional. Rude, not focused on their job but rather gossiping about other female customers. That’s really unprofessional behavior I have ever seen from casinos worldwide!They also mumble and cuss at foreign female customers just because they think that they can’t understand.I heard it all and was very turned off by this behavior.Focus on your job!The male dealers however, seemed ok except for one guy Choi Jinsung, who had a bad attitude problem too. He never once smiled and opens your cards even without your instruction. I could have made a complaint to the manager but was not bothered.Buck up guys, foreigners are your clientele. And if you don’t enjoy your job, don’t make it a problem for customers.", April 2019
4,1.0,Terrible service ,Terrible service towards foreigners.  Been going for months due to no other casinos in the area but will never go again. Terrible customer service and discriminating towards foreigners, October 2018
5,1.0,Terrible staff attitude toward foreigners,Terrible staff attitude towards foreigners whom they don’t understand because the crowd is largely korean speaking Chinese. The staff are really rude and it was really bad experience to entertain guests or clients. Secondly the dealer Shin GoKyun would accuse you of something bad because he cannot understand English and accuse you to the manager. I knew this because I could understand korean too. Such a shame and liar., July 2018
6,4.0,Part of the tour visit ,"Came here because it's part of the tour , I'm not into gambling , but the casino give free souvenirs like key chain and etc . My partner went to play a few round just for fun . Overall a good experience.", March 2018
7,5.0,Paradise Walkerhill Casino is the best one in South Korea!,"The dealers are super friendly, they give you nonstop beverage service with a wide variety of drinks, including alcohol.  They also have snacks they'll bring you.  & You get free food at the buffet that has lots of different foods.  They're very accommodating and get an A++ for customer service and friendliness.  They make you want to come back!", November 2017
8,5.0,"Nice, bright, & friendly poker tables","Went to Paradise specifically to play poker so this review is only about that.  They had a few tables going.  Manager was friendly.  The dealers were solid.  And the drink service was really good.  Not sure why so many low reviews about this place...I played 1000-2000 KW Texas Holdem no-limit.  All the players were friendly.  English is the preferred language.Great place to go for casual play on your trip.  If you are looking for serious competition and big money, this is not the place.It's easy to get to from subway via shuttle bus (Line 5 Gwangnaru stop. Exit door #2.  Cross Achasan-ro street and walk 200 feet north.  Look for brown Walkerhill shuttle bus sign).  The shuttle also stops at Gangbyeon on Line 2.One of the better poker experiences I have had across the world (despite getting felted by 8-4 offsuit by that Chinese guy who plays 100% and wins 99%! - you all know what I am talking about...).", July 2016
9,4.0,good casino,"I think this one is the best casino in seoul , although cannot compare with macao or singapore. I go to another casino in COEX, maybe the table game, open 10 to 15 table. Located in sheraton hotel. This casino have much more table open then others.Minimum bet KRW 10.000", July 2016
10,3.0,Poker room,"Free shuttle buses from the metro stations, good polite staff, not all of them speak English, but mostly they speak Chinese ))) only for foreigners: lots of Japanese, Philippians and Chinese people inside. Good poker room: 1-2$, 2-5$Asian pacific poker tours - are held here", June 2016
11,4.0,Smoke free! Nice..,"Small casino compare to Macau, but good selection of gambling tables. Slots are relatively less, however the table bets are good enough for us to pass some night time. Free drinks and foods, which is very good compare to casinos in other countries. Give it a try if you are boring at night..-)", March 2016
12,2.0,Like anywhere in Korea don't tip. The owner keeps the money not the workers.,It is OK.  It isn't what you expect.  There is very little English spoken if though no Koreans are allowed inside.  The over all experience is pretty dull at Walker., June 2015
13,1.0,"Poor Service, Terrible Staff and Unfriendly atmosphere...","I went here as part of my birthday weekend with a group of about 20 friends. It was a Saturday night, the casino was busy and we were all looking forward to a good night, and the casino should have been looking forward to making a tidy profit from us. As we were only playing low stakes roulette, we were first told we could only have beer as an alcoholic drink, despite them offering many other drinks. The service was extremely slow, and we were meant to feel almost embarrassed for ordering a drink. We then went to play blackjack together at a table, with our friends watching on. We were on a good run and winning a decent amount together, having fun, high five-ing and generally enjoying ourselves on a Saturday night. As a result we were then 'cut off' from drinks, and were told as we were winning we're not allowed any more drinks. After winning a few more hands overall as a group, security surrounded our group, pit bosses all around us and surly dealer accusing us of cheating, despite us previously tipping her. We were told to be 'quiet' as we were clearly enjoying ourselves too much I guess.Of course we lost a few hundred dollars between us, and some of us won a few hundred, but the overall experience left a terrible taste in our mouths and they've now lost a considerable amount of customers as a result. AVOID at all costs!", April 2015
14,4.0,"Serves the purpose, if you're looking to gamble while in SK","Came here as part of the 10 day layover on my way back to the US from the Philippines.  As an avid poker player, I wanted to see the offering.  Took the train to the local station and then a $5 cab ride got me here.  You have to be a foreigner to come here, so bring your passport.Casino is nice.  Service was good, too.  Poker room manager explained everything to me and was very helpful getting me into the game.  Free food and drinks only for table games players, so if you want some free noodles, buy in for $10 at a blackjack table, ask for the menu, order something, and it will be waiting for you at the restaurant in 5 minutes.Exchange rates suck, but you get the same rate both ways up to the amount that you initially bought.  If you end up winning money, keep the excess and change it outside of the hotel.Poker game was awesome.  I played the bigger game and it was good action against weak players.  I could make a living playing here.Don't know if I will ever go back to Korea, but will go back here if I do.", November 2014
15,2.0,Boring,"If you are looking for a Vegas-style casino that features people actually having fun, keep looking.  This place is simply boring.   Plenty of people there, but you could drop a pin and hear it land.  Dealers are not especially friendly, there are no craps tables, and the atmosphere in general is just dull - no locals are allowed so that adds to the disappointment.  Save you money and do something fun in Seoul...", December 2014
16,1.0,Paradise Walkehill Casino discriminates against non-Koreans and people that don't lose enough for them,"As a non-Korean gambler, I have played at Paradise Walkerhill casino many times.  However, after today, I will no longer do so after their discriminatory practices.First, they demanded that I must stay at the blackjack table for a minimum number of hands.  Basically, over the course of two weeks, I had hot streaks and had the self control to leave the table on the positive side after these runs (and after tipping dealers).  Then they instituted a rule and told me that I HAVE to stay at the table for a minimum amount of time.  Even if I am losing, I have to stay a minimum amount.  Or even if I feel like I have played enough and want to leave.Refusing to agree to this (and not get cash back for my chips), they said that I could not open any blackjack tables.  They said I could only play at a table that was already open, but I could only play the limits that they had.  So despite the fact I sat down and there were 3 open tables, they ""told me"" what the limit was.  That's it.  No discussion.  And despite the fact you are allowed to request deck type, they refused.  Funny, there were no complaints when I lost big money last month.Needless to say, I have fired off emails to the Korean casino regulators, where a casino is trying to force me to stay at the table.", August 2013
17,5.0,Great Casino. I think it's the only one for foreigners in Korea.,Korean friends are not allowed inside the casino.  But a nice way to spend a night with the buddies. I hear the concerts they have every now and then are pretty awesome and feature well-known artists., February 2012
