0,3.0,Not Too Much to See Here.,"There are several of these gates along Seoul. There is not really nothing amazing to see here. No directions, No history to be shared or told on the spot, noone to guide you or instruct you about what this or the other gates are about.  I recommend them during the night though", January 2020
1,4.0,Dongdaemun Gate,We have viewed this east gate both during the day time and in the evening.  Of course it is more impressive at night all lit up.  The gate was originally constructed around 1396 during the Joseon King Taijo's reigned.  The last rebuilt took place around in 1869.  Needless to say it is one of the four main gates that surrounds Seoul and still has part of the old fortress around it.  Yes it is difficult to get up close to view it.  Better photo ops from across the way., November 2019

6,5.0,"Lovely picture op, but you can't get close.","One thing I hate about Seoul is how bloody difficult it can be to cross the street. You can't really get close to the gate because of how the gates are set up, so don't feel bad if none of your pics turn out right.
