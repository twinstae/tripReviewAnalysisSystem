0,5.0,Avoid on Saturday but well worth it!!!,"Square is amazing, super beautiful and well worth the stop. I would highly recommend avoiding on Saturday due to protests, it does not make it in passable but more difficult to traverse. ", January 2020
1,3.0,It's just open space,"If I am reviewing the square itself then I would say it's a concrete slab of open space surrounded by streets and buildings on all four sides.  It's not as large as the one in Beijing but is still quite impressive in its hugeness.  Yes, there are a couple of impressive statues of long departed men that are good for a photo op but other than that there is nothing to do here.However, come on a weekend when one of many public protests occur and now we have something to talk about.  When I visited there was a massive (think 10000 people or more) protest against the sitting government and calling for increased solidarity with the US.  Without getting political, I found the energy, excitement and noise to be quite contagious and tbh, deafening.  This is where the square comes alive... speeches, music, flag waving, videos, marches, chants, police, pamphlets, angry people, happy people, confused people.  And I guess it is the square with its openness and inviting stance that enpowers its citizenry to gather and demand change in one collective voice.  Therein lies the purpose of a square... I guess.", November 2019
2,3.0,King Joseon & Admiral Yi Sun Shin Dominate This Square,"Just down from the two large palaces you will find this quite interesting square in the center of the road containing a statue of King Joseon (sitting) and Admiral Yi Sun Shin on a Pedestal.The square also has some interesting potted trees.The Admiral was famous for his battles with the Japanese during their invasion in the 16th Century, at the time Josoen was on the throne.", September 2019
3,4.0,Traffic Lanes Transformed To Public Square,"Just 10 years ago, this public square replaced 10 traffic lanes as part of various environmentally friendly renovations going on in Seoul. The big rectangle runs from Gwanghwamun Gate on the North to Sejongno Sageon intersection on the South. We walked its length from the intersection, en route to Gyeongbokgung, the city’s premier palace on a Saturday afternoon. I saw no greenery anywhere on the square to soften the effect of its vast concrete underfoot, but many attention-grabbers beckoned, including two big statues.We encountered the first statue almost immediately, at the Southern edge of the square. It depicts a standing Admiral Yi Sunshin (1545-1598), who led the defeat of the Japanese Navy in the Imijin War. A nearby fountain, known as the 12.23, commemorates the admiral’s 23 battles with 12 warships during that war. The second statue, also nicely crafted, appears in the middle of the square, showing King Sejong (1397-1450) seated on a throne. Among other accomplishments, he created the Korean alphabet.While looking around the king’s statue, we discovered an entrance at the rear that led to a lower level with two free exhibition halls focused on the king and the admiral. History buffs, we spent about 1 hour here, learning fascinating information about both men. Returning to sunlight again, we came across a book fair on the square, where many events are held for the public.Three traffic lanes flank both the East and West sides of the square and a Metro entrance is in the square itself. Government administrative offices appear beyond the lanes on the East Side and the Sejong Center (performing arts), which we also visited, is the standout building on the West side.", November 2018

18,4.0,Underground Museum - Good for a quick look,"We were walking through the square, saw the massive statues of King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sunshin, so we decided to stop in.  I found this museum very engaging for being devoted to only two historical figures. Turns out the King Sejong created the Korean language and was an early model for the value of scholarship.  Admiral Yi's story is simply amazing and the exhibits in that portion of the museum are fantastic.We intended to just have a quick look and ended up staying for two hours.

Apparently it is a protest free zone. On the weekend that I stayed in Seoul the whole area was taken over by many small, tent like stalls with groups, mainly of school kids & young people in a massive arts and crafts event. I liked the fact that at least two locations on the square (it's more like a long thin stretch of land between two large thoroughfares), they had built stages and people were performing different forms of music and dance. I sat around for quite some time in the warm October sun enjoying free entertainment on both the Saturday and Sunday afternoons. In addition to the imposing statue of the Admiral there was also one of King Sejong the Great of Joseon who created and introduced ""Hangul"", the native phonetic writing system for the Korean language.Nearby you have the City Hall, the Cheonggyecheon stream and, of course the whole Gyeongbokgung Palace complex.

Then take a picture with the Admiral Yi monument (famous for the turtle ships) before you head down Cheonggyecheon Stream.  Walk slowly and look back from time to time for a breathtaking view of the palace and mountain.

288,4.0,A historical memorial site,"It reminds me of Tiananmen Square in Beijing with historical monuments and statues. While Tiananmen Square boasts of the grand and majestic Forbidden City, Gwanghwamun Square proudly presents Gyeongbokgung Palace.in the scenic backdrop of Mount Bugaksan.  Gwanghwamun Square is, however, comparatively smaller, more relaxed, more modern, more commercialized and less crowded than Tiananmen Square. Although the US Embassy is just located in close proximity to the Square, the atmosphere here is less tense than that at Tiananmen Square. At Tiananmen Square, you see police patrol vehicles stationed right in the middle of the Square with armed military personnel on tight surveillance and standby watch for any suspicious activities.The two prominent artistic statues at Gwanghwamun Square: King Sejong and Admiral Yi Shun-sin blend harmoniously with the lustrous and dynamic surrounding and the historical palace at the other far end. King Sejong established the Korean alphabet (Hanjul) and was well remembered as the pioneer who laid the foundation for Korean culture and language. Admiral Yi Shun-sin defeated the Japanese invaders in a naval battle and safeguard the territorial integrity of Korea during the Joseon Dynasty. Without their great achievements, the vibrant and dynamic Korean culture would not have been in existent among one of the distinct and unique cultures in the world. The museum beneath the statues showcased the many magnificent artifacts during the reign of King Sejong of the Joseon Dynasty. After wandering around the Square and taking many photos of the two statues, we proceeded to witness the guards changing ceremony at Gwanghwamun Square. The Palace Guards were attired in colorful Korean traditional costume and they walked in elegance with an air of arrogance and pride. After the ceremony, we walked to Cheonggyecheon Stream and Cheonggye Plaza. Skyscrapers and commercial buildings dominated the skyline and it was like the City Hall and Orchard Road of Singapore with many well attired office workers streaming the area. From here, it was also a short distance walk to Myeongdong.   I would say Gwanghwamun Square is a historical icon of modern Seoul. I would say that you had not been to Seoul if you have not visited Gwanghwamun Square.", October 2014
