0,4.0,Beautiful buildings,A bit far from the city center. Nice view during spring season. This place is less crowded compared to Ewha University but might also because of we went there in the morning. Suggested to go early morning to avoid crowd., April 2019
1,2.0,"Not worth the visit, except for cherry-blossom season","The buildings in the campus are beautiful but in terms of architecture, they are only mocking renaissance-style, like those you would see at the amusement parks. But this campus is packed with visitors during the cherry blossom season. Located a little far from the center. If you are in a tight schedule, I do not see why you must visit this place.", October 2018
2,3.0,Kyunghee University Hall,"It is an European church style building outside but inside more of a theatre hall. There are two floors, first floor bigger with a stage in the front middle, second floor half size the first floor. Toilets are in each side of hall....left for ladys and right for gents. Parking space outside quit big enough for tens of buses.", July 2018
3,4.0,Good scenery on spring and autum,"The campus has a really nice view on spring and autumn. Not only the students, everyone can come here to enjoy the scenery, take photos (even the pre wedding photos), or picnic with friends. The only disappointment is that there were too many people on spring and autumn so I couldnâ€™t enjoy the scenery.", April 2018
4,4.0,"Worth of visit, especially when semester is started","Campus is stunningly beautiful at cherry blossom time! Apart of that buildings itself and area are nice to explore. Main adventure is definitely Korean students, how they live their university life:)", April 2018
