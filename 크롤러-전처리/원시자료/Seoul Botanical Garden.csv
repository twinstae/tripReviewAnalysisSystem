1,5.0,Worth visiting botanical garden,I was pleasantly surprised when I visited the botanical garden. It has opened relatively recently at far western end of Seoul. The glasshouse is designed like a lotus leaf and quite beautiful itself. You can walk a sky-bridge and see plants from above too., December 2019
2,5.0,Botanic garden + park,"If you love plants, this is a must visit place. There are different variety of plants in the garden and trees in the park. Directions: Take Exit 2 of Magongnaru Station (Line 9) and walk approximately 1 km", October 2019
3,5.0,Eternal peace within tropical greenery,"I just visited last Sunday and truly enjoyed myself. It’s a close walk from the station and it was easy to get there from south Seoul by the express train. The garden itself is lovely...and nicely decorated. Divided into various country areas with some fascinating plants and fruit trees. It’s still quite new, so the place inside as well as outside the restaurant feels fresh and nicely kept. Walking around the greenhouse garden made me really happy. It’s a nice place for a date too. There are spaces to explore within the building attached to it and I found interesting displays. Furthermore, there are other nature areas outside attached to the garden such as wetlands which I didn’t explore because I spent around 3 hours within the botanical garden and later had a nice meal in the 6th floor. There is a korean cafeteria and a Italian/fusion restaurant. I had herb bibimbap and it was really good. I’d like to go back here again and explore outside areas next time. As I can only attach 10 photos here, more pictures are on my Instagram @katfuz", June 2019

5,4.0,Very Nice place for botany lovers,There are beautiful flowers and plant in the park. One will take at least half a day to roam around the place.A plus point is that it is located near to metro station.Some of the flowers are gorgeous and if at the right time of the year one can even see Sakura there., March 2019
6,5.0,Great botanical park newly locating,"This is a fine botanical park which is under preparation. Currently, they allow a free temporary visit for limited facilities. Good to visit for families and couples. For tourists to enjoy flowers too.- Not famous yet. There aren't many visitors.- The grand opening is May, 2019. Prior to that, it opened to the public on Oct 11, 2018. Many facilities were still under preparation when we visited.- The entrance is free for some time.- A huge park with kid playgrounds, exhibition halls, flower gardens, snack bars, cafeterias, etc.- The main botanical garden is the highlight and very amusing. Lots of interesting plants, balloons, a sky bridge, etc.- How to reach: AREX & Line #9 Magoknaru is right outside the entrance. Line #5 Magok is pretty far to walk. The location is a bit away from the center of Seoul.- Good to enjoy cherry blossoms and fall foliages.- The pond is large and so peaceful. There's a huge I Seoul U sign near the pond.- The park is supposed to reach until Hangang(Han River). But, it was under construction when we visited.", November 2018
