0,4.0,Comfortable ride to our destination,Travelled on KTX to Pyeongchang and the ride is very smooth and comfortable. The KTX App is available in english and it's easy to search and book for your tickets using the app. Book your tickets earlier if you are travelling during the peak season so that you can get a seat.  , March 2020
1,5.0,fastest way to travel,tried the train from Seoul to Busan around 330 KM where it was around 2 hours and 40 minutes which was really fast and first class cabins was wonderfull  it was nice journey , February 2020
2,3.0,Not too bad,"Compare to Japanese train, KTX has room for improvement.  Luggage space is limited, toilet are not clean.", February 2020
3,5.0,Super Fast and Super Cool! Love it.,, January 2020
4,4.0,Perfect way to travel,KTX offer a pleasant travel between many cities in Korea. You can fully trust the time schedule and the ride is smooth. WiFi means you can work or leisure without problem. They don’t sell coffee though., January 2020
5,2.0,Fast but not much space for Luggage.,On this service the snack machines seem to take precedence over luggage storage space. The overhead space is very narrow and small so if you have large luggage get in quick because there is hardly any room. We ended up having to spread our luggage out over multiple carriages (and they were still not even in the proper luggage spaces) after being told to move them., January 2020
6,4.0,Way to go,"Good experience. Made easier by travelling with a local, who can communicate with most of the clerks, though some of them seem able to speak and understand some English. Trains are not as fast as to be worth describing them as bullet trains – 270 km/h is surely fast, but a Japanese Shinkansen is well above 300. Free Wi-fi works pretty well, allowing you to work while travelling. Every now and then the line drops, but it’s enough to re-connect to be back online. Seats are comfortable, each one has power plugs and USB ports to recharge your gadgets. Traveling is a quiet experience, thanks also to the good behavior of the passengers, who mostly refrain from speaking on the phone – less than ever loudly. Definitely much cheaper than the corresponding Shinkansen. A good alternative to flying if you go far. A very good alternative of driving, specially in winter time, when snow may be an unpredictable factor. And it definitely brings you to your destination much faster than a car. And more rested.", January 2020
7,5.0,Comfortable & Convenient!,"We travel from Incheon Airport and it just takes less than an hour to arrive Seoul town. The ticket is charging 500W deposit and it is refundable.

8,5.0,Fast and comfortable,"Travelling from Seoul Station to Busan Station in December 2019 on the first trip of the day was amazing. I slept the whole trip because the ride was very smooth. Took the KTX again two days later, from Busan to Seoul and the train was packed for the afternoon ride. We were given the seats with tables in between and I was able to work on revising our itineraries. Free and fast wifi was also provided on the train ride. Will ride this again.

Also, all announcements are in several languages (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese), so you are likely to understand and know when it is your time to depart the train.

26,5.0,Seoul To Gyeongju,"Wow! Talk about efficient! We purchased tickets online to guarantee a seat and exchanged it at Seoul Station for printed tickets. Takes 2 hours to get to Gyeongju (seriously beautiful, btw) and the ride was smooth and comfortable. Our tour in Gyeongju ended a little earlier than anticipated and we were not able to get an earlier ride back to Seoul, they were sold out. We just chilled at Sin Gyeongju station.

33,4.0,Comfortable Trip into Seoul,Seoul airport is easy to get around. The automatic ticket machines are easy to use but there is a ticket desk near the entrance if you need help. It’s a quick trip into the city and you pay more for reserved seats. I used this service for my first trip and used the standard service for my other 3 trips., October 2019
34,4.0,GOOD.,, October 2019
35,4.0,Impressive but not quite as fast as the Japaneses version.,"Korean trains are fast, easy to use, clean and safe.

40,4.0,"When they are fast, they are fast...","Nice and comfortable trains, but not all of them are as fast as the Seoul-Busan line. Actually even not all trains on the Seoul-Busan line are equally fast - at different hours they are different - some stop at more stations, some - at just a few. The Seoul-Jinju line is disappointingly slow - it takes over 3.5 hours to get to the final station, and the distance is actually smaller than Seoul-Busan, where the fastest train needs just over 2 hours to travel the whole distance with speeds of up to 300 km/h", October 2019
41,4.0,Worth using,We used the KTX from Seoul to Busan and it was enjoyable.  Get your ticket in advance as you really need to book a seat; it was a popular journey.

61,5.0,Touring South Korea ,, September 2019
62,5.0,Excellent way to get around the ROK,"On my last visit I was able to take a day to visit friends in Gwangju, in South Jeolla Province.  Because I had limited time, I took the Express train rather than the local.  The cost was somewhat more; but it was still affordable; and the time element was much more advantageous than it would have been with the slower train.  The train itself was comfortable and on time.  It is equipped with wifi, though it took me a bit to figure out how to get connected.  (It helps if you ask the conductor for help rather than trying to figure it out for yourself - unless you're more experienced than I.)  In any case, the train both ways was on time, and I enjoyed seeing the Korean countryside on the trip.", June 2019
63,5.0,Train to Busan,"Everything was clean, fast and reliable.  wonderful service, but I noticed some coldness toward foreigners. We took the KTX from Seoul to Busan and back. There were no zombies, though. My youngest was still scared because the train looked just like the one in the movie.  Hardly saw any attendant, but the ride was so short, it didn't matter. However, if you needed something right away it might be a problem. There were no food options on board. but lots of shops at both Seoul and Busan stations. We felt very comfy staying at the stations shopping and eating while waiting for the train. We got 2 day flex group saver korail pass and saved some money, though only a few dollars, the lady at the service counter explained.", August 2019

The train is also comfortable, clean, fast and on time.", August 2019
66,5.0,One of the most efficient in the world,"This is one of the most efficient high speed train systems in the world.  It is fast, clean and comfortable.  It is better than air travel since it takes you from downtown to downtown, so you can avoid traffic congestion especially during rush hours. From KTX stations, you can easily make connections to subway or taxi.  The Seoul Metro is probably the most efficient subways in the world.  For long-haul take Metro, and for short-haul take taxi. Credit cards are commonly accepted in taxi, and the fare is cheap.", May 2019

I traveled from Seoul station to Busan and back and thoroughly enjoyed the trip without any hassles or issues.  We had bought our tickets a month in advance and when we arrived at Seoul station, we lined up at the ticket counter to get the seat numbers.   The line moved very fast so we had plenty of time to do some window shopping prior to boarding the train.  Boarding was very easy as the ticket tells you the cabin number and the seats.  The inside was very clean and seats very comfortable.  What I loved was the quiet atmosphere in the cabin. Our train left the station on time and arrived at our location not a minute later than what the timetable predicted.  Our return from Busan to Seoul was equally great.  Hats off to KTX!", July 2019

81,4.0,"Smooth, fast, clean","Theres no other way to travel to other cities far than by using KTX. Bus is so 1990s. Train is so smooth you dont even realize your on a train.

The on;y unique thing about KTX are the platform.. you will see vendo machine and even vendors selling stuff and food which I find it cool :) unlike other strict country trains... Plus the train as this eucalyptus smell on all the trains.. or maybe because it s winter and the heater has this scent., November 2018
92,5.0,Fast and on time,We took this train from Seoul to Gyeongju and it was excellent. It cost $80 round trip and made the trek in 2 hours each way vs 5 hours by car.

93,5.0,Great way to travel Korea,Took train from Seoul to Busan. The 2.5 hour trip was very comfortable. Trains are very clean and fast. Seats recline and plenty of legroom.

Highly recommended., June 2019
94,3.0,Room for improvement,"Ensure tickets are purchased for front facing or it would be uncomfortable. Lift to platform is tiny and allow time if you do not want to use the stairs especially when you have luggage. The steps up the train with luggage can be challenging too. Doesn't help when most staff speak only Korean. Luggage compartment for bigger luggage is very small and you may end up having luggage in another cabin if you come late. Train speed is not uniform and for shorter distance between stations, speed is slowed down. We spent 2.5 hours Seoul to Busan but 3 over hours from Busan to Seoul so please note when you purchase tickets, some timings would have more stops. Toilets available in train but hygiene is not there. Only some seats have sockets to charge your gadgets.", June 2019

100,5.0,Fantastic railway system,"If you think HK and SG were great, try Korea! By far the most complex railway system I have seen thus far, if you need to go around Korea, going by train is the best way to do it! Very efficient, fast and they can bring you all over the place! You have to purchase a T-Money card in order to ride. The good thing about the T-Money card, it can be also used on buses, taxis and even some establishments. You can pickup your T-Money card at any convenience store around Korea.", May 2019

The best way to reach that historic and beautiful place from Seoul is via train.  My daughter choose the KTX.  I was so surprised because the train leaves and arrived on time.  The train and its stations are very clean, spacious and orderly.   KTX is comparable to the European and Japanese trains that I have travelled.   I will still take the KTX when I travel back to South Korea.", April 2019

Staff shows big respect for their clients. Example for the rest of the world. And there you go, with 300km an hour, as fast as a F1 car.", May 2019
110,4.0,Needs improvement but accomplishes the mission,"I have taken the KTX numerous times for work and vacation. I have not had a bad experience yet caused by Korail. Their app works well, but you cannot buy tickets within 20minutes of the train departing. Even if there is an error it is best to check/refund ticket before trying to buy another ticket in case the first one went through. All the staff I have dealt with in Daegu and Seoul have spoken clear English. Their trains are delayed more often than Japanese ones. If you get a first class ticket you get free bottled water and some snacks. You can get standing room only tickets which means you can seat in an open seat but must give it up if someone that has a ticket for that seat comes through. The standing room only tickets are cheaper than any other ticket. The seats are comfy and normally have an outlet and USB outlets. With regular seats, it is odd as they don't rotate so the center seats face each other and all the seats after face towards that center row.

113,4.0,Great train but CHINESE BULLET TRAIN FTW~!,"My first time going to Korea was May 2018(last year). Once I arrived at Seoul Railway Station, I rode on one of those trains to get from Incheon Airport to the city centre. Very long journey because the distance from Incheon to Gangnam is about 60+km!!! It felt comfortable inside with air-conditioning and route guide. However, the speed isn't as fast as the Chinese Bullet train that can go up to 400 km/hr. This one only goes 270km tops. Well, it's ok either way.", June 2018
114,5.0,"On time, efficient, comfortable","Great train system: on time, comfortable, and with big windows for viewing. The actual online system for getting tickets is, however, a real pain, especially if you first buy a pass and then need to get the specific tickets you want. Take seriously the requirement to remember (write down) the pass number.", May 2019
115,5.0,"Quick, comfortable and better than flying","Travelled between Busan and Soeul without any worries. Speed about 300km/hr. Very comfortable, lots of room, far more than any plane. A better way to travel!", April 2019
116,5.0,Great way to travel,"I took the KTX train from Seoul to Busan and then back again a couple days later. The entire process was ridiculously easy. First, buy your tickets in advance online (I had no trouble with this, just use common sense and you’ll be fine). I bought the economy seat and it was nice. Then the day of, get to the station 20ish mins before departure. All you need is a printout of the ticket you bought online. Check the boards for the track number, follow the signs to the track, check you’ve got the right train (boards again or on the sign on the train itself), check the car number, board and find your assigned seat. They never even scan or look at your ticket. There is a luggage rack for big suitcases on each car, though if it is carryon size you can fit above your seat. There is a bathroom and small vending machine in each car as well. They display your destination and any stops along the way in English as well as Korean. The entire journey from start to finish was so easy and pleasant.", May 2019

119,5.0,Civilized way of travelling in Korea!,Took KTX from Seoul station to Dongdaegu for my personal travel.     Although the train was showing some wear and tears it still looked well maintained.    Boarding and departure was on time as usual and ride is very comfortable despite its high speed.     Love the luggage rack space at the rear of the train cars as they are ideal for storing oversized luggage for travelers.    It made a few quick stops at major cities along the way and I arrived in Daegu a few minutes ahead of schedule.   The entire trip took about two hours.     I find high speed train travel in Korea much more convenient than domestic flight as it saves you from heading to airport and clearing security etc.     You can literally show up about 20 to 30 minutes at the station and get on the train.  Convenience factor alone surely beats domestic air travel in Korea., April 2019

121,5.0,Smooth and comfortable,"The ITX train we rode on going to Gapyeong was amazing. It had +20 carts and had upper and lower levels. The seats had ample legroom and could be turned to face the opposite direction, which is good for groups of four if you want to spend most of the ride chatting. There were clean bathrooms and the doors were automatic. I'm glad I was able to experience the ITX rather than taking the bus on my way to Nami Island, Petite France, and Garden of Morning Calm.", April 2019
122,5.0,Comfortable and easy to manage,"We traveled from Busan to Seoul. Our first class seats were comfortable. Though we had the help of local friends, the process of checking in and finding the right location seemed easy. We were hoping to see a lot of the countryside, but we quickly discovered that South Korea is a nation of tunnels, and much of the ride is inside tunnels.", April 2019

127,3.0,KTX booking problem (when booking abroad),"I've struggled to book a ticket online from the US (east coast) as the website kept throwing reservation errors. It turns the transactions only go through during Korean business hours. If anyone else had this problem, simply wait until it's late (like midnight).  But you will not be able to choose your seat.", April 2019
128,4.0,Two Trips Both Good,"This is an excellent train company, at least on the two long distance trips that I took. The trains were impressively clean and on time. The costs are also very reasonable. The bullet train was impressively quick and handy for the centre of Busan and Seoul.", April 2019

132,1.0,Poor KTX booking service,"I took KTX from Busan to Seoul on 30/3/2019 departure time 14:00.  I came with a group of +/-100 persons (incl. elderly people and children) from Thailand.  It's the first time that I visit Korea. After the train has passed around 2 stations. There are passengers (Korean) who got the tickets with the same seat number.  They asked us to get out from the seat but we refused.  After that, our tour leader and the guide were tricked by train officer.  He told us to move to the next car which has more seats.  So, in order to avoid trouble and argue with Korean passengers, we moved to next car. but there are no seats at all.  This mean all of us have to stand for 2 hours to Seoul. The officers (old man and lady) in KTX has low service mind and can't communicate in English.  I could say the rail system in Japan and China train are even better than KTX/Korail.  Moreover, even you want to send the complain letter, they have no e-mail or FB to hear the feedback from customer as well.  So, don't expect for improvement in near future.", March 2019

152,4.0,So fast and nice and clean.,"I like to take KTX train when I don't want to take the bus, or I want a faster way to get home. KTX is very convenient. A can be pricey, which is the negative. It gets you faster to your destination, compared to the bus, but it can be pricey. However, the ride is smooth, and you can rest and pull your chair back to rest. So much more comfortable just a little bit than being in the airplane.", February 2019
153,4.0,Fast and comfortable fast train service,Took the train service from Daejeon and Seoul and it was an extremely smooth ride. Seats were comfortable and there was wifi on board. Trains generally ran on time and You could get tickets online or at the train station itself. Just a point to note that it’s best to buy your return ticket ahead of time because certain routes are very popular and it might be inconvenient if you do not manage to get a ticket which entitles you to a seat because it means standing in the small space between train carriages, December 2018
154,5.0,Easy and direct access from Inchon Airport,"Inchon Airport has signs, and the ticket counter has English Speaking clerks. Trains can be local (stops before Seoul) or Express (non-stop). Very clean, modern, inexpensive.", February 2018
155,4.0,A great way to get to Busan from Seoul,"A comfortable ride, although not as fast as you would expect or as hyped (not as fast as Shinkansen). Coach seats are comfortable and the view from the windows is good. Limited food and drink on board (just a few vending machines), so bring your own (lots of choices in the station). Arrive early to avoid the last minute rush of boarding the train, especially if you have large luggage over 21 inches. As seats are reserved, pretty much exclusively, buy on-line ahead of time. Note that KTX website in English can be frustrating and make sure to read the entire page before submitting. View out the windows is good, but your neighbors may put the shades down and block your view. Train was clean and well maintained.", December 2018
156,5.0,smooth ride,"went to Busan with KTX train.  Since i purcuas business class ticket, the seat is very comfortable with a lot of leg room.  Although it is not the same ""business class"" as the airline can provide, with only a little bit more than two hours ride, this is the best and cheapest business class ticket you can get. Totally worthy, in my opinion.  In addition, you can arrive at the platform 10 minutes before the departure time (2 hours for your air travel!!!) , no checkin, no security checkpoint, no passport.....no hassel!!   You can get up and walk around as you wishes. Also, free wifi is available too.  Overall, its a good experience.  I'lll definitely choose KTX again to other cities in Korea next time when I travel.", November 2018
157,5.0,Train to Busan,"Very convenient way of travelling from Seoul to Busan. The KTX had USB charging ports and drink vending machines. Best to purchase some food and drinks before boarding the KTX. Took approximately 2 - 3 hours to reach from Seoul to Busan and vice versa. There were multiple timings for the train and you can either purchase your ticket at the train station or online. First time taking the KTX after going to Korea for so many times. Nonetheless, efficient way of travelling from the northern region of South Korea to the southern region. A bit pricy but worth the journey. I was also recommended by my friend to purchase tickets via Klook which was slightly cheaper.", January 2019

The cost was about 50-60 USD per person for economy and took about 2 to 2 1/2 hours each way to travel the 275  to 280 km. The ride was comfortable, the seats were similar to economy class by air with more room. There is also space for luggage. The KTX trains are designed to provide timely transportation and they do. The KTX car was was one of 18 on our train, the passenger compartments were a comfortable temperature and there is no smoking, both of these features were appreciated. Having never ridden a “bullet” train we were pleased that neither acceleration nor deceleration was too noticeable. The train did not have a dining car so if you wish food or drinks you need to bring your own. Lastly the KTX train’s have many convenient  terminal locations .

Travel time is approximately 2-1/2 hours.  A limited number of KTX trains run directly from Incheon Airport to Busan.

The journey from Busan to Seoul in the end took 6 hours, with long stops at various stations.
