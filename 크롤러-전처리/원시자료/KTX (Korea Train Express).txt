0,4.0,Comfortable ride to our destination,Travelled on KTX to Pyeongchang and the ride is very smooth and comfortable. The KTX App is available in english and it's easy to search and book for your tickets using the app. Book your tickets earlier if you are travelling during the peak season so that you can get a seat.  , March 2020
1,5.0,fastest way to travel,tried the train from Seoul to Busan around 330 KM where it was around 2 hours and 40 minutes which was really fast and first class cabins was wonderfull it was nice journey, February 2020
2,3.0,Not too bad,"Compare to Japanese train, KTX has room for improvement.  Luggage space is limited, toilet are not clean.", February 2020
3,5.0,Super Fast and Super Cool! Love it.,"We woke up very early in the morning as we were heading towards Busan. Busan is a city that its located, literally on the lowest bottom of the South Korean Peninsula, meaning it will take a multitude of hours to reach through several types of transportation, except for a plane of course. But by taking a plane, one will miss some of the country side views and diverse cities we went through with the KTx Bullet Train Korea.We bought First Class as we wanted piece and quiet and yes, why not? we wished to experience the full comfort that a Super Train that travels at 300 Km per/hour = 187 miles per/hour, has to offer. We actually checked the speed on the Iphone and screen shot it for your convenience to see.We literally did not noticed when the train took off and it was not too long after that we reached the top speed mentioned above. It was like going on a feather, it felt as we were going 50 km per/hour a soft and unforgettable ride, that at that super fast speed took us to the lowest point of the peninsula in 3 to 4 hours only (counting several stops in some mayor cities along the way).They give you a small treat and cookies in First Class. nothing too fancy, but the seats are bigger, wider and you have lots of leg room with a huge table just for yourself.We did love the ride as we mentioned and we do recommend this experience as a Must See and Try when in Seoul and South Korea in general. First Class cost 80 dollars a piece and per trip, therefore making the math, me and my wife we spent some 300+ US$, almost the same price than going by plane minus the long ride to the airport which is costly (80 US$ a pop and per trip) and minus the hassle and security checks of airports and bumpy rides and nasty small seating space.Totally worth!!!!. Enjoy the pictures we shared for you.", January 2020
4,4.0,Perfect way to travel,KTX offer a pleasant travel between many cities in Korea. You can fully trust the time schedule and the ride is smooth. WiFi means you can work or leisure without problem. They don‚Äôt sell coffee though., January 2020
5,2.0,Fast but not much space for Luggage.,On this service the snack machines seem to take precedence over luggage storage space. The overhead space is very narrow and small so if you have large luggage get in quick because there is hardly any room. We ended up having to spread our luggage out over multiple carriages (and they were still not even in the proper luggage spaces) after being told to move them., January 2020
6,4.0,Way to go,"Good experience. Made easier by travelling with a local, who can communicate with most of the clerks, though some of them seem able to speak and understand some English. Trains are not as fast as to be worth describing them as bullet trains ‚Äì 270 km/h is surely fast, but a Japanese Shinkansen is well above 300. Free Wi-fi works pretty well, allowing you to work while travelling. Every now and then the line drops, but it‚Äôs enough to re-connect to be back online. Seats are comfortable, each one has power plugs and USB ports to recharge your gadgets. Traveling is a quiet experience, thanks also to the good behavior of the passengers, who mostly refrain from speaking on the phone ‚Äì less than ever loudly. Definitely much cheaper than the corresponding Shinkansen. A good alternative to flying if you go far. A very good alternative of driving, specially in winter time, when snow may be an unpredictable factor. And it definitely brings you to your destination much faster than a car. And more rested.", January 2020
7,5.0,Comfortable & Convenient!,"We travel from Incheon Airport and it just takes less than an hour to arrive Seoul town. The ticket is charging 500W deposit and it is refundable. Claim back your deposit when your arrival from the kiosk machine. Comfortable with spacious seats and there is a corner for your luggage. So, sit still and enjoy your view outside.", December 2019
8,5.0,Fast and comfortable,"Travelling from Seoul Station to Busan Station in December 2019 on the first trip of the day was amazing. I slept the whole trip because the ride was very smooth. Took the KTX again two days later, from Busan to Seoul and the train was packed for the afternoon ride. We were given the seats with tables in between and I was able to work on revising our itineraries. Free and fast wifi was also provided on the train ride. Will ride this again. Highly recommended.", December 2019
9,5.0,Best choice when traveling around Korea. ,"If you don‚Äôt like long lines at the airport and all the chaos then I highly recommend taking the KTX Train around Korea. It‚Äôs convenient, fast, clean and comfortable and priced just right. KTX is always my first choice ‚ù§Ô∏èüöÑ", December 2019
10,5.0,good,"nice n convenient to other town. ticket easily to purchase at ticket machine, english n chinese version display.", December 2019
11,4.0,Smooth and efficient,"The KTX is just fast, reaching 300kmph speed. Our trip from Seoul to Busan (and the return journey) left in time, calling at the stops as scheduled. Thats about it. Having travelled on the equally fast Eurostar, TGV, ICE and the Renfe trains, I rank KTX below them from the experience viewpoint. Seats are comfy enough but personally the interior could be better. I did not find any buffet car to enjoy the coffee and cakes and the scenery is not that great (of course I do not compare with the likes of the Glacier Express). If you are a train buff, ‚ÄúMan in seat 61‚Äù website would give you an insight for comparison.", December 2019
12,4.0,"Clean, quick and easy!","Prior to my travels, I read that many people suggested to buy tickets beforehand. This depends on your timing of travel. I was easily able to buy tickets minutes prior to boarding the train. The trains are clean and comfortable, and they have electrical outlets and wifi! Also, all announcements are in several languages (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese), so you are likely to understand and know when it is your time to depart the train. I do recommend taking your own drinks/snacks because there was minimal provided in the train's vending machines.", December 2019
13,4.0,"Comfortable, Efficient but Bring your own food/drinks","We took the Express train in First Class from Seoul Station to Busan on a day-trip and found the service to be comfortable with a fast and smooth ride.  2+15 enroute direct or 3+00 on the inner route through Ulsan.  The trains are SPOT-ON-TIME so do not be late.Once caution, there is no bar/snack/restaurant car at all.  There are a few snack/drink machines to purchase something small.  First Class passengers have free cold bottled water available in the F cabins and a very small cookie/pastry snack is offered (2 of each per bag).  So if you travel and want something enroute, be sure to pick it up at the train station before departure.Of note, I strongly recommend F class as the Coach seating is VERY compact and crowded and would be uncomfortable for the average American-Sized passenger.  Even at that, we had trouble finding F seats on some trains even mid-day.Booking on-line was impossible so we just bought our tickets at the station.  The agents have a good command of English. Seats are assigned at purchase.", December 2019
14,4.0,Easy to travel ,"Been on our own traveling to and fro Seoul and Busan. The train is well kept and have storage areas for large luggages. Clean toilets and comfortable seats. It takes us nearly  3 hours to go to Busan. There is am space for hand bags and also hanging our coats. The frequency of train is good . From11 am to 16:30, it is nearly every hour or event every 20 min per train. Train leaves punctually, so be at right platform 15 min before. Food bought outside can be consumed at the train.", December 2019

16,5.0,"Fast, Comfortable, Easy to use, Cheap","I took KTX trains all over the country and it made me wish this is what all travel was like. Seoul is an amazing city, but if you want to see the rest of Korea, have no fear of KTX trains or the KTX system.", December 2019
17,5.0,Excellent KTX,"Clean, on time, comfortable, good services. I have bought both way  ticket online from Pusan to Seoul. I have go to train station in Pusan to change to paper ticket. Every thing is OK.", June 2019

19,5.0,Right on Time!,"It is so efficient and punctual! Bear in mind, if you are using KTX in Korea to travel long distance in short time. You have to be in time so that you won't miss your train. The train departs right as scheduled. So, always make sure you'd be at the platform (not waiting area) 15 mins before departure because your train is right there waiting. Board and have some books with you to kill the 2hours++ time. Enjoy your ride!", December 2019

22,4.0,Very fast for day trips; book advance to get seats,Time taken to travel from one place to another was very fast! Pressure keeps building up in my ears. Instructions were clear. Information on train tickets and at railway stations are easy to understand for english. Train rides are very quiet despite being full. Some places need to book tickets earlier as they run out of seats e.g. from jeonju to busan (through osong) and trains from yongsan to jeonju. Some time slots were already fully booked when we tried to book about 4 days in advance., December 2019
23,4.0,Fast and efficient,"Booked the ticket online for Busan to Seoul sector, well in advance. The process was smooth as there were instructions in English. The train was punctual and the compartment was neat and clean. You can pick up packed food from counters at the station. There is a place at the entry point of the compartment where you can store your luggage", April 2019
24,5.0,Excellent train service,"We travelled on the KTX service from Seoul to Busan and back. The journey was great, trains were punctual and, with a Korean rail pass, the fares were very reasonable.", November 2019
25,5.0,Clean and fast,"Great counter staff who assisted me even when I asked them which public wifi spot I could tap on, and they got us the front facing seats we wanted. The ride was super comfortable and toilets are decently clean. Definitely will take it again as it is a more convenient alternative to taking airplanes within korea.", September 2019
26,5.0,Seoul To Gyeongju,"Wow! Talk about efficient! We purchased tickets online to guarantee a seat and exchanged it at Seoul Station for printed tickets. Takes 2 hours to get to Gyeongju (seriously beautiful, btw) and the ride was smooth and comfortable. Our tour in Gyeongju ended a little earlier than anticipated and we were not able to get an earlier ride back to Seoul, they were sold out. We just chilled at Sin Gyeongju station. There's some shops and a couple of restaurants. KTX is awesome!", October 2019
27,5.0,"Great system, especially for the price (but weird slowdown around Sejong City)","Great system for the price and quite fast as most have already noted.Also connected to major metro stations for easy access to subways.The average speed is about 300km/h or more between Seoul and Busan.However, there is always a strange slowdown around Sejong City.Probably would cut travel time by ~15m if this slowdown doesn't happen.", May 2019
28,5.0,Fast efficient way to travel in Korea,"Fast, clean and efficient way to travel in Korea. Seoul to Daegu is about 2 hours. On a busy weekend, you might want to get a ticket in advance, or else you might end up with standing room only, which means standing in the area between the cars near the bathroom - not a fun way to spend a few hours.", October 2019
29,5.0,Train To Busan,Easy to find the train and the train is clean and the seat is comfortable.Ready your tickets early as i can see the train is fully booked.The ticket is not cheap but for me is an experience because of the movie - Train to Busan., October 2019
30,4.0,Super fast train,KTX is the best way to travel long distances in Korea. Its better than by air as it leaves from the middle of Seoul and lands in the middle of your destination in the city you are visiting. Very comfortable and free wi fi. Ideal if travelling to Busan, October 2019

32,5.0,Fast/Clean and Comfortable train,"Traveling with KTX train is always one of my favorite public transport to Busan/Gyeongju and etc, Pros:- The train seating for second class is comfortable, and clean. Staff over the counter is helpful, as i need to change earlier train schedule from Pohang to Busan to avoid long waiting inside the station. They manage to help me change without any problem on the day itself.", October 2019
33,4.0,Comfortable Trip into Seoul,Seoul airport is easy to get around. The automatic ticket machines are easy to use but there is a ticket desk near the entrance if you need help. It‚Äôs a quick trip into the city and you pay more for reserved seats. I used this service for my first trip and used the standard service for my other 3 trips., October 2019
34,4.0,GOOD.,"My guess very cheep, in Japan 3-4 times more.also,much easy to use than metro in Korea.In Seoul is for me is nuts.", October 2019
35,4.0,Impressive but not quite as fast as the Japaneses version.,"Korean trains are fast, easy to use, clean and safe. Tickets are bought at the various stations and come complete with train, carriage and seat number all in Korean & English. They run of time so make sure you get to the platform early rather than late.", October 2019

38,5.0,"Clean, efficient and on time",Took the KTX train to Busan (no pun intended). The whole experience was like clock work. Tickets were easy to pre-purchase. Only suggestion would be to purchase the food on the platform rather than commercial options in the plaza., November 2018
39,5.0,Train to Busan,"The most convenient way to travel to Busan. Ride first class, free water and some mix nuts and cookies.", October 2019
40,4.0,"When they are fast, they are fast...","Nice and comfortable trains, but not all of them are as fast as the Seoul-Busan line. Actually even not all trains on the Seoul-Busan line are equally fast - at different hours they are different - some stop at more stations, some - at just a few. The Seoul-Jinju line is disappointingly slow - it takes over 3.5 hours to get to the final station, and the distance is actually smaller than Seoul-Busan, where the fastest train needs just over 2 hours to travel the whole distance with speeds of up to 300 km/h", October 2019
41,4.0,Worth using,We used the KTX from Seoul to Busan and it was enjoyable.  Get your ticket in advance as you really need to book a seat; it was a popular journey.  It took about two and a half hours.  Take a drink and snacks with you as I don‚Äôt think there is a refreshment area on board., October 2019

44,5.0,Fast and comfortable,"Took KTX from Seoul to Gumi Gimcheon, due to work. Bought VIP seat which is very comfortable and spacious. Snacks and water bottle are provided and the journey took about 1 hr 10mins. In the train you wont feel how fast it was traveling - 300km. Some more there is free WIFI.", October 2019

47,5.0,Can Be Very Fast,"We took the KTX from Daegu to Seoul, but this time the one that made several local stops. It took 1 hour and 45‚Äô, but better to take the non-stop that takes only 1 hour and 15‚Äô. It is definitely faster than regular train and bus.", October 2019

53,4.0,Comfortably Fast,"Took this train from Seoul to Busan and vice versa. Ticketing was easy, although you might find the queue a little long if you decide to buy at the station. Not the most modern train, but fast, clean and comfortable. Definitely a more comfortable choice for traveling between the two cities (compared to airplane).", March 2019
54,5.0,Fast and Comfortable,the train was from Seoul to Busan took about 2 hours but the train was fast and the riding was smooth, May 2019
55,3.0,Easy and smooth but some issues with first class,"The good thing about the KTX is that its really easy to use. If you travel outside of peak days then you should have no trouble just show up at the station, buy your tickets and travel with the train. Worked like a charm for me landing at Incheon early, taking the Arex to Seoul station and just buy tickets. Grabbed a quick lunch and went to Busan. The train will depart at its scheduled time and it will be at the terminal stations 30 min before departure. Its the best way to get between major cities in Korea.I used the KTX for a round trip to Busan from Seoul.I thought I should go with first class to busan and back since Im on vacation and not on a budget. The train was easy to find and you just board the car and all is good for a relaxing ride to Busan... or that was what I thought.Its when you enter the train you realize that the standard on this train is sub par even on first class. The first class car was very shabby. the seats where torn and I found stains on them. Well some wear and tear should be expected but this was a bit too much when traveling on first class. When the train departed it was more or less full and thats when I saw the second drawback with first class on KTX. It started to feel like a commuter trains. People where walking back and forth all the time and others where switching seat after each station. There were also people standing in the area between cars blocking passage to toilette etc. Back from Busan to Seoul it was even worse and I had people standing right next to me in the first class car between some stations.I assume those were standing ticket passenger but why are they allowed into first class cars? Basically I bought first class tickets and it felt like I was riding a glorified subway train. The Arex Express trains turned out to be better than the KTX first class and the KTX is nothing even close to the Shinkansen.If you travel with the KTX dont bother with First class since you pay extra only to get a wider seat and a free bottle of water (which you cant get to because of people blocking the passage). Dont expect a calm and relaxing trip and prepare to have people walking by you constantly. Basically hope for window seat, put on some really good ANC headsets, try to ignore all the fuzz going on around you and pray you dont have to use the toilette.", September 2019
56,4.0,Very good ,We used the KTX a couple of times and in overall very satisfied with it. Be aware that if you try to get a last minute tickets you might not find it on rush hour., October 2019
57,4.0,Best way to and fro airport and city,"If you're travelling with family with kids and luggages, this is the best option for you. It's fast, cheaper than taxi and easy. If you took Korean Air airline then you will get additional discount. Kids below 3 ride for free but they won't get a seat. KTX brings you from airport to Seoul Station which is 5 mins taxi away from Myeongdong.", October 2019
58,5.0,Easy and smooth,"Trains were on time and comfortable. We had friends who ordered our tickets so I can't say anything on that process, but finding the train and the everything was very simple.", September 2019

60,5.0,Best experience,"KTX is one of the best train services in the world. They are punctual (not as good as Japenese), very comfortable, and very fast! I travelled in this train thrice from and to Seoul. Even when the train goest at 300 km/h, one will never notice the speed or jerk. It's very smooth. They do announce the stations in English so the tourists won't miss it. Travelling on this train is a must while in South Korea.", September 2019
61,5.0,Touring South Korea ,"We took the KTX bullet Train from Seoul to Gyeongiu ( 2 hour trip),where stayed for a day. We also took the train from Busan back to Seoul ( 2 and one half hour trip).  Tickets and and picks were arranged by our travel agent Kate DeLosso. Tickets seemed to cost about 49-59,000 WON each. We were a little concerned about communication once we were dropped off at the outbound station, but this was unfounded because the information desk was quite helpful and signs for the trains and tracks were clearly marked in English. There were elevators/steps/escalators to get to the tracks. We had to use the elevator because of our suitcases. The trains were on time on both occasions. I loved that seats were assigned. Trains were clean. There were a group school kids in our train car, going on field trips, on our first train. They were the friendliest group of kids I have met, trying to engage us in small talks. Great way to move from city to city in South Korea. My only hang up was lugging the suitcase and bag. It was a good experience (unlike our bullet train ride from London to Paris and back, broke down twice, and no apologies). I would recommend the KTX train if you plan to visit these cities.", September 2019
62,5.0,Excellent way to get around the ROK,"On my last visit I was able to take a day to visit friends in Gwangju, in South Jeolla Province.  Because I had limited time, I took the Express train rather than the local.  The cost was somewhat more; but it was still affordable; and the time element was much more advantageous than it would have been with the slower train.  The train itself was comfortable and on time.  It is equipped with wifi, though it took me a bit to figure out how to get connected.  (It helps if you ask the conductor for help rather than trying to figure it out for yourself - unless you're more experienced than I.)  In any case, the train both ways was on time, and I enjoyed seeing the Korean countryside on the trip.", June 2019
63,5.0,Train to Busan,"Everything was clean, fast and reliable.  wonderful service, but I noticed some coldness toward foreigners. We took the KTX from Seoul to Busan and back. There were no zombies, though. My youngest was still scared because the train looked just like the one in the movie.  Hardly saw any attendant, but the ride was so short, it didn't matter. However, if you needed something right away it might be a problem. There were no food options on board. but lots of shops at both Seoul and Busan stations. We felt very comfy staying at the stations shopping and eating while waiting for the train. We got 2 day flex group saver korail pass and saved some money, though only a few dollars, the lady at the service counter explained.", August 2019

65,5.0,Great way to travel,"We chose to travel by high speed rail from Busan to Seoul and it turned out to be a great idea. Our hotel in Busan was just next door to the station so it was very convenient. The train station is tidy and offer breakfast choices. The train is also comfortable, clean, fast and on time.", August 2019
66,5.0,One of the most efficient in the world,"This is one of the most efficient high speed train systems in the world.  It is fast, clean and comfortable.  It is better than air travel since it takes you from downtown to downtown, so you can avoid traffic congestion especially during rush hours. From KTX stations, you can easily make connections to subway or taxi.  The Seoul Metro is probably the most efficient subways in the world.  For long-haul take Metro, and for short-haul take taxi. Credit cards are commonly accepted in taxi, and the fare is cheap.", May 2019
67,5.0,"It is very handy,and we enjoy travelling by KTX","we travelled from Seoul to Busan in South Korea a distance of 326 km It took 2:30h.It is beter than trvelling by air,and cheaper , very comfortable so we strongly recomend using the KTX in S.K", August 2019

69,5.0,Efficent and clean,"We took KTX from incheon airport to Seoul station to Busan.  It was on a Monday.  I read that we can go directly from incheon airport to Busan but that wasn't true.  We had to buy a ticket to Seoul Station first.  They have discounts if you traveled with one of the Korean air carriers at the kiosks.  Kiosks are easy to navigate in English. Or  They also have a special at the desk,  three people for 24000 won.  At Seoul station,  you have to go up to the second floor and buy tickets at the kiosks. The desk lines are slow.  The train tracks area are easily marked with numbers.  The tickets have a cabin number and seat number on it.  They can be strict about it if you aren't in the correct cabin. There is a bathroom on the train and luggage storage. They do random ticket check on boardIncheon airport to Seoul station takes about 35 minutes. Then We bought the fastest to Busan,  2.5 hours.  ~59800 won each. No discount I believe.", September 2019

72,5.0,"Fast, clean, comfortable","I used the KXT to go from Daegu to Seoul and, although it is more expensive than the train or bus, it is so much more comfortable that it is worth the extra price. It is also much faster, making it more convenient especially if you are going to the airport. The train terminal connects with the airport through both an express train or one that makes more stops. Take the express train! There is also a place in the terminal to store your bags for a reasonable fee if you are going to spend some time in Seoul before leaving.", August 2019

75,5.0,Excellent service from Seoul Station to Busan and back,"I have traveled on trains in many countries on various vacations but I feel KTX provided the best service so far.   I traveled from Seoul station to Busan and back and thoroughly enjoyed the trip without any hassles or issues.  We had bought our tickets a month in advance and when we arrived at Seoul station, we lined up at the ticket counter to get the seat numbers.   The line moved very fast so we had plenty of time to do some window shopping prior to boarding the train.  Boarding was very easy as the ticket tells you the cabin number and the seats.  The inside was very clean and seats very comfortable.  What I loved was the quiet atmosphere in the cabin. Our train left the station on time and arrived at our location not a minute later than what the timetable predicted.  Our return from Busan to Seoul was equally great.  Hats off to KTX!", July 2019

91,5.0,Fascinating!,The train is as good as Singapore.. The on;y unique thing about KTX are the platform.. you will see vendo machine and even vendors selling stuff and food which I find it cool :) unlike other strict country trains... Plus the train as this eucalyptus smell on all the trains.. or maybe because it s winter and the heater has this scent., November 2018
92,5.0,Fast and on time,We took this train from Seoul to Gyeongju and it was excellent. It cost $80 round trip and made the trek in 2 hours each way vs 5 hours by car.  It is Korea‚Äôs bullet train and can reach very high speeds. It is THE smoothest train I have ever been on. We recommend it highly., June 2019
93,5.0,Great way to travel Korea,Took train from Seoul to Busan. The 2.5 hour trip was very comfortable. Trains are very clean and fast. Seats recline and plenty of legroom. Electrical outlet is provided so charging your phone or laptop is a breeze. Complimentary wifi is provided and it worked well throughout the trip. Toilets are clean too. Highly recommended., June 2019
94,3.0,Room for improvement,"Ensure tickets are purchased for front facing or it would be uncomfortable. Lift to platform is tiny and allow time if you do not want to use the stairs especially when you have luggage. The steps up the train with luggage can be challenging too. Doesn't help when most staff speak only Korean. Luggage compartment for bigger luggage is very small and you may end up having luggage in another cabin if you come late. Train speed is not uniform and for shorter distance between stations, speed is slowed down. We spent 2.5 hours Seoul to Busan but 3 over hours from Busan to Seoul so please note when you purchase tickets, some timings would have more stops. Toilets available in train but hygiene is not there. Only some seats have sockets to charge your gadgets.", June 2019

96,4.0,Train to Busan,We got the train in the evening down to Busan. Getting to the tracks was fine in Seoul station and getting tickets was easy. Actually it would have been cheaper and less time to get a plane but the timings didn‚Äôt work! We were glad though we got to experience Korean train journey! The seats were comfortable in first class and we were given a small snack (a cake and some nuts). Comfortable journey., June 2019
97,5.0,Preferred City to City Travel,"We purchased the Korail Pass and found the website easy to use.  After purchase, it was simple to book our tickets for each leg of our trip.  Car and seat number were clearly printed on our tickets.  The website said to print both the pass and tickets but no one ever asked us to see them.  The trains were well maintained, comfortable, on time and fast.  Luggage racks were located at the end of the cars and were able to accommodate our large suitcases.  Luckily we we‚Äôre able find space on each leg so we did not need to lug them to our seats.  Our seats had foot rests, overhead storage and reclined.  The trains were comparable to the Shinkansen in Japan.The ride was smooth with limited stops which allowed us to sleep most of the way.  Announcements, as well as LED displays, gave heads up on stations in multiple languages so we had good awareness on our location.The Busan, Seoul and Shinyeongju stations were big and busy but not too difficult to navigate.  Each had waiting areas but you could walk to the designated track, even if the trains were not boarding, as there were no ticket takers or gates.  With the exception of Shinyeongju, the stations were conveniently located in the heart of the cities we visited.In summary, the KTX was a great way to travel around Korea without the need to hop on a plane.", June 2019
98,5.0,excellent!!,"Was very impressed by the efficiency and how on time the train is. Train is clean and seats are comfortable. They provide free wifi services as long as you are on the train.

100,5.0,Fantastic railway system,"If you think HK and SG were great, try Korea! By far the most complex railway system I have seen thus far, if you need to go around Korea, going by train is the best way to do it! Very efficient, fast and they can bring you all over the place! You have to purchase a T-Money card in order to ride. The good thing about the T-Money card, it can be also used on buses, taxis and even some establishments. You can pickup your T-Money card at any convenience store around Korea.", May 2019

The best way to reach that historic and beautiful place from Seoul is via train.  My daughter choose the KTX.  I was so surprised because the train leaves and arrived on time.  The train and its stations are very clean, spacious and orderly.   KTX is comparable to the European and Japanese trains that I have travelled.   I will still take the KTX when I travel back to South Korea.", April 2019
104,5.0,Super Fast Everything!,The train is well maintained and neat inside. Convenient way to get from Seoul to Busan in quick time with high speed internet on board. A unique trait of the staff on board - they bow to the passengers before disembarking at every station., July 2018
105,5.0,Very punctual and clean. But limited space to put big luggage.,"KTX train is very punctual.Interior is clean.Free wifi & can charge your phoneBut if you have many big luggage, can't put above your seat, have to find own space behind near the toilet and put there.", May 2019
106,4.0,Depart on time,"You can book online which ia slightly cheaper, however i would suggest you to pay slightly more (than online fare) - arrive at the station and decide the next departure. You can easily book your train. There are many trains for you to choose according to the time you prefer. There are lots of food and convenient store around the station.The train leaves and arrive on time", May 2019
107,4.0,Excellent high speed trains.,"We took KTX twice, once from Pyeongchang to Seoul and then from Seoul to Busan. The train was absolutely on time, clean as a whistle and had comfortable seating. The main difference between these trains and the ones in Taiwan is that in Taiwan they serve tea or juice on the longer runs and in Korea they did not, but this is not really a problem. Just bring your own. The stations were large and open, capable of handling high volumes of traffic efficiently. The signage was generally very good, with English signs for Europeans and signs in Chinese and Japanese as well. The language diversity of the train system was laudable. I would gladly travel this way again. It offers a much better chance to see the country than flying.", May 2019
108,4.0,Nice way to travel,"Our guide took care of the tickets and all that, so I can't say if it is easy to get tickets. But the trains are comfortable, there is information in English. There are power outlets so you can charge your phone.", May 2019
109,4.0,Travelling by train is a pleasure.,"This is so nice. Just book your train and seats in their portal, you can easily change your tickets and get a refund in case you made a mistake or just want another train, trains are very clean and always in time. Staff shows big respect for their clients. Example for the rest of the world. And there you go, with 300km an hour, as fast as a F1 car.", May 2019
110,4.0,Needs improvement but accomplishes the mission,"I have taken the KTX numerous times for work and vacation. I have not had a bad experience yet caused by Korail. Their app works well, but you cannot buy tickets within 20minutes of the train departing. Even if there is an error it is best to check/refund ticket before trying to buy another ticket in case the first one went through. All the staff I have dealt with in Daegu and Seoul have spoken clear English. Their trains are delayed more often than Japanese ones. If you get a first class ticket you get free bottled water and some snacks. You can get standing room only tickets which means you can seat in an open seat but must give it up if someone that has a ticket for that seat comes through. The standing room only tickets are cheaper than any other ticket. The seats are comfy and normally have an outlet and USB outlets. With regular seats, it is odd as they don't rotate so the center seats face each other and all the seats after face towards that center row. It is an odd feeling to be traveling facing the opposite direction.", May 2019
111,5.0,Great Way to Travel Korea,I used the KTX to travel from Seoul to Busan and return. I travelled first class seating and reserved my tickets online from Canada and printed them off for the trip. I used the Korail website but their are other agents that will book for you. Cost each way was just under $100 CDN and it took about 2:20 each way.The KTX is the high speed rail option (300kph) for travelling major routes in Korea. It is operated by Korail. There are other options that are slower and cheaper but may be an option for budget conscious travellers.The stations at Seoul and Busan are large and modern with all manner of amenities. The signs are in English as well as Korea and it is relatively easy to find your way around. About an hour before departure the track for your train will be displayed on the board and about 20 minutes before departure you can board the train on that platform. With a reserved seat just find the car and the seat on board.Many people bring food on board. First class had lots of table space and room to set up and eat. The numerous vendors around the station offered all manner of treats and supplies. I enjoyed Gimbap which are essentially long California Sushi Rolls. You also get a cookie and some nuts from the conductor.My ticket was never checked. The conductor came through (bowing when entering) and it appeared as if she compared a listing with which seats were occupied. All in all very straightforward and stress free.Seating was single on one side of the aisle and double on the other side. Lots of room and very comfortable. Carry on was stowed above my head in a rack and there was and area for large item storage by the entrance to the car. There were USB ports for device charging.There is public transit access outside the stations which are located in main business districts downtown., May 2019

113,4.0,Great train but CHINESE BULLET TRAIN FTW~!,"My first time going to Korea was May 2018(last year). Once I arrived at Seoul Railway Station, I rode on one of those trains to get from Incheon Airport to the city centre. Very long journey because the distance from Incheon to Gangnam is about 60+km!!! It felt comfortable inside with air-conditioning and route guide. However, the speed isn't as fast as the Chinese Bullet train that can go up to 400 km/hr. This one only goes 270km tops. Well, it's ok either way.", June 2018
114,5.0,"On time, efficient, comfortable","Great train system: on time, comfortable, and with big windows for viewing. The actual online system for getting tickets is, however, a real pain, especially if you first buy a pass and then need to get the specific tickets you want. Take seriously the requirement to remember (write down) the pass number.", May 2019
115,5.0,"Quick, comfortable and better than flying","Travelled between Busan and Soeul without any worries. Speed about 300km/hr. Very comfortable, lots of room, far more than any plane. A better way to travel!", April 2019
116,5.0,Great way to travel,"I took the KTX train from Seoul to Busan and then back again a couple days later. The entire process was ridiculously easy. First, buy your tickets in advance online (I had no trouble with this, just use common sense and you‚Äôll be fine). I bought the economy seat and it was nice. Then the day of, get to the station 20ish mins before departure. All you need is a printout of the ticket you bought online. Check the boards for the track number, follow the signs to the track, check you‚Äôve got the right train (boards again or on the sign on the train itself), check the car number, board and find your assigned seat. They never even scan or look at your ticket. There is a luggage rack for big suitcases on each car, though if it is carryon size you can fit above your seat. There is a bathroom and small vending machine in each car as well. They display your destination and any stops along the way in English as well as Korean. The entire journey from start to finish was so easy and pleasant.", May 2019
117,5.0,Forward Facing,"Find your car# and then your seat within the car. From Seoul to Busan seats 9-16 are forward facing and 1-8 are backwards facing. From Busan to Seoul seats 1-8 are forward facing and 9-16 are backwards facing. Easy and comfortable way to get between these 2 cities. Get to the platform 30 mins early if you have big luggage and stow in between each car. Book tickets online at LetsKorail.com. If you get a seat facing backwards, just refresh the browser/restart the process again so a new seat# is assigned. To get a non-stop train, check the times to make sure that the train travel time is 2.5 hours. The stops don‚Äôt really add much time though and it‚Äôs still quick and efficient.", May 2019

119,5.0,Civilized way of travelling in Korea!,Took KTX from Seoul station to Dongdaegu for my personal travel.     Although the train was showing some wear and tears it still looked well maintained.    Boarding and departure was on time as usual and ride is very comfortable despite its high speed.     Love the luggage rack space at the rear of the train cars as they are ideal for storing oversized luggage for travelers.    It made a few quick stops at major cities along the way and I arrived in Daegu a few minutes ahead of schedule.   The entire trip took about two hours.     I find high speed train travel in Korea much more convenient than domestic flight as it saves you from heading to airport and clearing security etc.     You can literally show up about 20 to 30 minutes at the station and get on the train.  Convenience factor alone surely beats domestic air travel in Korea., April 2019

121,5.0,Smooth and comfortable,"The ITX train we rode on going to Gapyeong was amazing. It had +20 carts and had upper and lower levels. The seats had ample legroom and could be turned to face the opposite direction, which is good for groups of four if you want to spend most of the ride chatting. There were clean bathrooms and the doors were automatic. I'm glad I was able to experience the ITX rather than taking the bus on my way to Nami Island, Petite France, and Garden of Morning Calm.", April 2019
122,5.0,Comfortable and easy to manage,"We traveled from Busan to Seoul. Our first class seats were comfortable. Though we had the help of local friends, the process of checking in and finding the right location seemed easy.

It is just a normal train with limited stops. Trains are a bit dated although the cabin is clean. But toilet outdated. Average speed is about 100 kmp. A bullet train speed in China is between 200 to 310. So don't be mistaken the KTX for a bullet train.", April 2019
125,5.0,Great Transportation,"I love traveling by train and our experience on KTX was exceptional.  We traveled from Seoul to Busan in southern South Korea and it was a dream.

But you will not be able to choose your seat.", April 2019
128,4.0,Two Trips Both Good,"This is an excellent train company, at least on the two long distance trips that I took. The trains were impressively clean and on time. The costs are also very reasonable. The bullet train was impressively quick and handy for the centre of Busan and Seoul.", April 2019

131,5.0,Chose this over flying. ,"It was a toss up about traveling from Busan to Seoul. Glad at chose Korail KTX.I was but certain about booking online so went to Busan station to book the tickets 2 days ahead of the journey. Short queue, questions answered, train selected.I chose the 935 am train, economy class. Cost me about usd 63 for the trip. 2 tickets issued by a printer and charged to credit card.  Couldn't be simpler.  Coach number and seat number assigned. Arrived half hour before the departure time. Checked out the track number. Mine was track 6.15 min before the, an announcement was made to go in. Do check the lighted signboards.Walked to coach 15, boarded and relaxes for the 2 1/2 hr trip.

132,1.0,Poor KTX booking service,"I took KTX from Busan to Seoul on 30/3/2019 departure time 14:00.  I came with a group of +/-100 persons (incl. elderly people and children) from Thailand.  It's the first time that I visit Korea. After the train has passed around 2 stations. There are passengers (Korean) who got the tickets with the same seat number.  They asked us to get out from the seat but we refused.  After that, our tour leader and the guide were tricked by train officer.  He told us to move to the next car which has more seats.  So, in order to avoid trouble and argue with Korean passengers, we moved to next car. but there are no seats at all.  This mean all of us have to stand for 2 hours to Seoul. The officers (old man and lady) in KTX has low service mind and can't communicate in English.  I could say the rail system in Japan and China train are even better than KTX/Korail.  Moreover, even you want to send the complain letter, they have no e-mail or FB to hear the feedback from customer as well.  So, don't expect for improvement in near future.", March 2019

135,5.0,Great way to get across Korea,"We really enjoyed our trip on the KTX from Seoul to Busan and back. It was fast, efficient, clean, comfortable, and a good way to see some of the Korean landscape outside of the main cities. Onboard wifi and USB charging ports are a bonus.However, the ticketing and seat booking process is somewhat confusing - despite pre-purchasing our passes, we had to sort out our tickets once we were in Seoul as we were travelling with kids and both the website and phone customer service was unclear. Also, seats at popular times at popular times book out quickly, so do this earlier if you can.", March 2019

139,3.0,KTX train to Busan from Seoul,"We had a pretty bad experience taking the KTX train from Seoul to Busan. We did some research prior to our trip to Seoul and all reviews said there were multiple and regular trains to Busan. When we reached Seoul Station at around 1 pm, we were told by the counter staff that the next available direct train was at 5 pm plus. As we did not wish to waste our time (4 over hours) waiting for that train, we took the next offer to go on another train departing at 2.45 pm but there were NO seats left and we have to stand all the way to Busan and there were 6 stops before it reached our final destination. The worse nightmare in the train was that there were actually NO standing space. We have to stand outside the toilet and or near the space for putting the lugguages. Besides us, there were also others standing around too. One guy literally sat on top of the toilet seat throughout the journey when nobody used the toilet! üôÑLesson learnt: make sure to buy the ticket online prior to your trip if you wish to take the train to other cities in South Korea. The reason why we did not buy the tickets prior to our flying there was, we read a number of reviews and all these reviewers said there will be NO hassle getting the train tickets upon arrival in Seoul! That is definitely incorrect information! PLEASE REMEMBER to buy the tickets online from Korail‚Äôa website prior to your trip!", March 2019

142,4.0,"Efficient, Fast and Comfortable","We have used the KTX six times now, always between Seoul and Daejeon, which is an hour out of Seoul on the Seoul to Busan line.Tickets can be booked online, where you can select an English language version of the website and it it VITAL to pre-book, well in advance, because trains fill up.  Bizarrely, once booked, you are unlikely to be asked for your ticket as KTX employees patrol the carriages making a note of occupied seats, hence, as long as you have a ticket and are sitting in the correct seat, you are fine.Seats are comfortable, in pairs, although there is an option when booking to request a group of four with a table between - few in number, very popular and sell out quickly.  You have a foot rest and a lap table which folds away into the back of the seat in front.  There are toilets in each carriage, together with mother and baby  facilities, and we have been given bottles of water by staff asking through the carriage, although not on every occasion.Etiquette on the train, of which you will view various videos on the subject on the overhead screens in the carriage, is that passengers are quiet whilst the train is in motion.Announcements regarding the next station are given about five minutes in advance.  The train does not stand in any station for very long, so you do need to be prepared. Announcements are given in Korean and English.There are luggage racks overhead, but these are only really suitable for hand luggage.  If, like us, you are catching the KTX after a long haul flight and have large suitcases, you will need to store them in the luggage area by the doors of the carriage and this is my biggest gripe with the KTX trains - they are sadly lacking in luggage storage for large pieces, which is unusual for a service which is running outwards from the capital city.  The step up and down into the carriage is also high and steep and requires some effort with a large suitcase, although the Korean people are exceedingly polite and helpful and I have had many incidences of help with getting on and off trains.When arriving at Seoul station and potentially progressing onto the metro system, you will also find that it is not always user friendly for those with heavy luggage, with stairs being the only option at some stations and some quite lengthy walks between stations.Because of this, we are planning to use the bus in future.

It gets you faster to your destination, compared to the bus, but it can be pricey. However, the ride is smooth, and you can rest and pull your chair back to rest. So much more comfortable just a little bit than being in the airplane.", February 2019
153,4.0,Fast and comfortable fast train service,Took the train service from Daejeon and Seoul and it was an extremely smooth ride. Seats were comfortable and there was wifi on board. Trains generally ran on time and You could get tickets online or at the train station itself. Just a point to note that it‚Äôs best to buy your return ticket ahead of time because certain routes are very popular and it might be inconvenient if you do not manage to get a ticket which entitles you to a seat because it means standing in the small space between train carriages, December 2018

155,4.0,A great way to get to Busan from Seoul,"A comfortable ride, although not as fast as you would expect or as hyped (not as fast as Shinkansen). Coach seats are comfortable and the view from the windows is good. Limited food and drink on board (just a few vending machines), so bring your own (lots of choices in the station). Arrive early to avoid the last minute rush of boarding the train, especially if you have large luggage over 21 inches. As seats are reserved, pretty much exclusively, buy on-line ahead of time. Note that KTX website in English can be frustrating and make sure to read the entire page before submitting. View out the windows is good, but your neighbors may put the shades down and block your view. Train was clean and well maintained.", December 2018
156,5.0,smooth ride,"went to Busan with KTX train.  Since i purcuas business class ticket, the seat is very comfortable with a lot of leg room.  Although it is not the same ""business class"" as the airline can provide, with only a little bit more than two hours ride, this is the best and cheapest business class ticket you can get. Totally worthy, in my opinion.  In addition, you can arrive at the platform 10 minutes before the departure time (2 hours for your air travel!!!) , no checkin, no security checkpoint, no passport.....no hassel!!   You can get up and walk around as you wishes. Also, free wifi is available too.  Overall, its a good experience.  I'lll definitely choose KTX again to other cities in Korea next time when I travel.", November 2018
157,5.0,Train to Busan,"Very convenient way of travelling from Seoul to Busan. The KTX had USB charging ports and drink vending machines. Best to purchase some food and drinks before boarding the KTX. Took approximately 2 - 3 hours to reach from Seoul to Busan and vice versa. There were multiple timings for the train and you can either purchase your ticket at the train station or online. First time taking the KTX after going to Korea for so many times.

165,2.0,Not up to par with other high speed rail,"The very first thing I noticed about this train is that it almost looks like an Amtrak train, inside and out. The train design is outdated, and certainly doesn‚Äôt look like it belongs being a bullet train. I will get back to the design issue shortly. On the inside, half of the cars seats face forward, half backwards, with no ability to change them. There is also no way that I know of to determine which direction your reserved seat will face. That aside, the inside of the train is stuffy, the grey carpet roofing tacky, and just a generally dated design.Here is where the exterior and interior design issues come together: the train hits speeds of up to 265km (164miles) per hour. It‚Äôs cabin does not pressurize/depressurize properly, leaving you with bloated ears and general discomfort most of the way. Combined with the stuffy interior, and a backward facing seat, you may, like me, wish you had taken a bus.One other thing I learned about this train is that other than different colored seats and a tad more space and free bottled water, there is no additional benefit to reserving first class seats, something which even Amtrak in America has figured out.For some perspective, I‚Äôve been on high speed trains in Europe and Japan, and other than its speed which the cars are ill-suited for, this train is not in the same league. It‚Äôs just a regular train with a powerful engine, totally not meant for the sub-par cars it‚Äôs attaches to.", December 2018

The cost was about 50-60 USD per person for economy and took about 2 to 2 1/2 hours each way to travel the 275  to 280 km. The ride was comfortable, the seats were similar to economy class by air with more room. There is also space for luggage. The KTX trains are designed to provide timely transportation and they do. The KTX car was was one of 18 on our train, the passenger compartments were a comfortable temperature and there is no smoking, both of these features were appreciated. Having never ridden a ‚Äúbullet‚Äù train we were pleased that neither acceleration nor deceleration was too noticeable. The train did not have a dining car so if you wish food or drinks you need to bring your own. Lastly the KTX train‚Äôs have many convenient  terminal locations .

Travel time is approximately 2-1/2 hours.  A limited number of KTX trains run directly from Incheon Airport to Busan.

We made seat reservations over the internet.", November 2018

If you can't get a seated ticket, there is few cabinet where you can seat provided if is not occupied.One great thing I notice is KTX or ITX station. Lift is link all the way to ground level!

KTX staff could not speak English and I had to figure things out on my own (where to take the train, when will the train arrive etc). The journey from Busan to Seoul in the end took 6 hours, with long stops at various stations. I am highly disappointed in the service, considering how high the price is compared to other mode of transportation. Would expect staff to be able to converse in basic English or announcements to be made in English.", November 2018

202,4.0,Trains are on time and relatively cheap,"I booked the KTX first class from Busan to Seoul. You go to the platform 15-20 mins before departure. Basically no security checks whatsoever. When you book online, the tickets are immediately issued and you would have to print out a physical copy and save it as a softcopy for backup as they do not email a copy to you. There is no need to exchange the printout again at the station for another ticket. The pros are the trains leave on time and the first class has enough leg room, some cookies and water is provided. There are areas to store limited large baggages on either side of the car and smaller ones can go on top of the cabin seats. This is run like a lean machine, very few employees on board. There is free wifi but signals can be intermittent. Ride is smooth. The pleasant experience is somewhat marred by the behavior of some of the passengers. There are a few who will target foreigners and pressure them into thinking they have the wrong seats and to give it up. Finding your correct seat is idiot proof so there is no way one can sit in the wrong place unless it is deliberate.  Everything from the Train, Car and seat Number is stated clearly on the ticket so stand your ground if this happens even when they start to talk loudly or argue to embarrass you. I suspect many do not adhere to their asdigned seats or pay extra for a higher class seat and move around the train hoping they can get away with it. Other than this, it is a fast and pleasant way to get around major cities in Korea. I would give this 4.5 stars as a train service and 3 stars because of some minority passengers.", October 2018

Easy to follow to load money.Subway is very busy esp in Peak hour. We were very frustrated when lifts and escalators were not working due to having a painful foot injury.

Tip:  if you want to sit together ( the wife insists on this!!!!) seat B and C are together with A across the isle.

237,1.0,Terrible Customer Service who can't understand English,"I had similar experiences with some of the other travelers here, which clearly shows that yes there is a problem with the KORAIL ONLINE TICKETING SYSTEM!We tried to book the tickets to Busan, and upon clicking payment, the system hang showing an error message. With no email notification, and no reservation number, we figured that the booking didnt went through, so we clicked to purchase the second time. After we show up at Seoul to exchange the tickets, the officer also didnt inform us that we had 2 tickets bought... It was only after we came back from our trip that I realized I was charged twice for the tickets! We tried to call their customer service hotline, but with their limited English, they couldnt really understand me. Also no email or online messenger to contact them, and the only way is to attempt to speak to their staff via the hotline. So after explaining everything, the stuff still didnt understand and just kept telling me no refund as it's pass the travel date already. Even after I explained that it was due to the error on their website, yet they still insist that there's no error on their website, so no refund. SERIOUSLY?!!!! The mistake was from your own website yet it has been incurred to so many customers innocently. For those traveling to Korea, I would suggest that you buy direct from the station and not from online. Also, good luck too as I remember that the staff could'nt really speak much English at the station too!", August 2018

245,5.0,Couldn't think of a better way to travel,"For our second visit to South Korea the best, fastest and easiest way to travel from Seoul to Jeonju and Busan to Seoul was to take the KTX.  The service was always on time, clean, seat comfortable and traveled in near silence.  As we were on a schedule I purchased our tickets online one week in-advance, an easy booking and payment process.  The ticket price never changes, always a fixed price not like in Europe.  I purchased second class tickets which are significantly cheaper to first class and just as comfortable for a 1.75 hour and a 3 hour journey respectfully.  Seats are assigned and tickets issued immediately online ready for printing at home.  We always take water and pick up snacks in the subway or nearby train station for the journeys, but you can purchase on-board.", April 2018

The downsides: high cost (about $50 one-way Seoul-Busan), and lack of knee space. if you can spare the extra money, splurge on the First Class seats!", July 2018

250,4.0,Good way to cross South Korea,"Traveled from Busan to Seoul in about 2 hours.  Very quick and convenient.  You are given an assigned seat, and it is better to stay there, even if the car is half empty, or risk being rapped by the attendant and told to move.  Very interesting view of South Korea, mostly green mountains, fields and clusters of apartment buildings.  Less suburbanization than you would think.", May 2018
251,5.0,"Express to Seoul in 40 minutes, convenient","Take the express to Seoul, rather than taking a taxi. You will save roughly $70 if you are alone. The KTX costs around $25-$30 per person (depending on exchange rate), so if you are more than 3, you may want to take a taxi. I still think the KTX is more convenient, faster and don't have to worry about traffic or getting into an accident. The train has Wifi, so you will be connected. Cool. There are no drinks or food on the train so if you want to eat something, buy it beforehand. Depending on where you will be actually staying in Seoul, it might be better to take the normal train (not the KTX). The normal train is far cheaper and it costs me only $2 to get to Seoul, instead of the KTX. Yes, it takes 20 minutes longer, but I would rather save $20 for the 20 minutes. :-) Now, there goes the tip. Once the KTX drops you off at Seoul STation, you will have to take a taxi or take the metro anyhow.... assuming you are not staying at Seoul Station area. I have made it to 155 countries. I have an extensive blog at pinchetravels.com, if you want to read more about my travels.", September 2017
252,4.0,Quick trip,Traveled from Busan to Seoul on the KTX. Price was approximately 80000.00 KRW P/person for first class.

254,4.0,Nice train but Japan is better,"in 2017 my Family travel to Japan. and in this June 2018 we travel to Korea.KTX is OK. But in Japan people are quieter. In Korea, I found people talk louder and some people didn't bother to watch the mobile phone without earphone, which makes the train ""noisy"". Older people have reserved seat. But if the reserved seat is full, I don't find the younger people willing to give up their seat (unlike in Japan where all young people seems to right away give their seat to elderly / those in need). Also there are no Officer in Korea Station where we can ask question. The signage not as clear as Japan. In Japan there are officer who were very helpful to both local and tourist.", June 2018

265,4.0,Reliable trains but rather expensive,"Used the Busan to Seoul service and was happy with our experience. You have plenty of space in your seating, there are power outlet for charging and you can choose whether you want to sit facing the driving direction or backwards. The train left on time and arrived on the minute. Very efficient, only the price was the only concern.

273,5.0,Cost Effective Travel around Korea,"Coming from Australia I can only say our Government have a great deal to learn about public transport. We took the ITX to ChunCheon and for 7300 won each to travel each way it was not only cheap but comfortable and actually on time. The ride was so smooth you forgot you were on a train. Book online at least one day before and select your date and time and you will travel cheap. The Korea Travel Pass is also a great idea but about an 81000 won initial outlay (but you do get greater flexibility). We left ChunCheon earlier than expected (after gorging on Dak Galbi at Dak Galbi Street. and with the help of the wonderful young lady at the tourist information booth, were able to get on an earlier train at no cost. But be beware, if you buy at the station on the day you risk not getting a seat and standing room only.", May 2018

275,4.0,Different for English and Korean page of the site,"My family went to Korea in late March. I didn't want to buy a Korail pass as we only needed a one way ride from Seoul to Busan.Ticket seat reservation opens only 1 month prior and navigating their site is easy enough but there is a difference.With the English page, you can't choose your car or seat number. It is randomly chosen by the system for you, which was a no go for me as I wanted seats near the luggage storage areas. The Korean page however is more comprehensive. I tried it out using google translate and it allowed for a wider range of options including choosing your car and seat number. Downside though is that you have to input a local Korean contact number to be able to reserve it. So in the end, I had our guide, TOP Korea, reserve it for me because I couldn't do it myself. Senior citizen discount was availed of for my parents because I booked thru Amy of TOP Korea thru the Korean page. The English page doesn't have this option.Things to note:1. You print out the ticket and that's it. You don't need to change it for any actual ticket like with other countries. Ours wasn't even checked while on board. Maybe because they could see we weren't local.2. Car and seat counting is in reverse for the Seoul to Busan trip. Car 20 is first and Car 1 is last. Same with seats, row 1 is the last per car.3. Luggage storage areas are limited for the economy cars. I was told by our guide they are generally located between cars 5-7. We took the KTX 251 for Seoul to Busan and we used up all the luggage storage area in between our car, for our luggage alone so yes, it's limited. Over head areas can store backpacks and a smaller sized luggage but was made of see through glass like material so it's better if it isn't too heavy. Their is no space to store luggage behind the last row of chairs per car on KTX 251. We checked out KTX 117 before it left and it seemed to have space. So it's different per train I guess unlike with Japan wherein you can store big luggage behind the last row.4. Arrive early if you have big luggage, the luggage storage areas are also used for product shipments as we saw on our trip. Our train was ready for boarding 30 minutes prior to our trip so we just boarded ahead of time to make sure we had luggage space.5. No food cart on KTX 251 so if you want food, buy at one of the food stalls before boarding the train. There are around 8 food stall stands at the top of the stairs before going down to the platform. More inside the station building itself.6. Navigating the station is clear cut, everything is marked clearly. Boards have announcements constantly updated with English. Boarding area of the KTX trains is pretty small and also clearly designated so you won't get lost. No problem at all even if the personnel don't understand or speak English.Overall, it was a clean, smooth, on time train ride.", March 2018
276,5.0,One of the best train,"I bought a pass for 7 days to go round South Korea and it was the best decision I ever made. It allowed me to go back and forward to the Busan, Seoul, Jeonju, Daegu, Yeosu and many other places cheaper than if you buy single trip on the spot. If I missed the time, I simply go to the ticket counter and ask for the next train without even paying again. It's fast and on time. You won't even feel you are in the train. Nice.", May 2017
277,5.0,Great way to get from the airport to the city,Seoul airport is a good 45 minute train ride away from the city centre so it is best to get the express train from the airport for a direct route to the city. Leave the airport departure and walk to the information centre to buy your tickets which at the end of your ride you put in a machine to help recycle your tickets and get some money back. The information desk is wonderful and directs you to the platform where you wait for your train to arrive near the door that will open according to the carriage number on your ticket. The trains arrive promptly and you need to get on promptly so don‚Äôt hang about! A great resource to enhance your travels, April 2018

279,4.0,fast and comfortable,"I've taken this to Busan as well as Masan now. Both times were comfortable, convenient and fast. Only problem is if you're lugging large luggages, you'd find places to store it a little hard. Price may be expensive but if you're looking to save time, then this is for you. Best is to head to Seoul Station or book online for KORAIL pass so you save up (esp on group bookings). Only drawback to the pass is you have to go the station to reserve tickets (cannot do that online).", April 2018

And I just need to wait for 30 minutes which is enough time for me to grab a quick lunch before boarding the train. The seats of the train is also very comfortable with enough leg room to stretch. The seat can even be shifted so that you are leaning slightly backward and comfortable enough for you to sleep. There is also a removable table for you to put your stuff. For some seats, there are even charging point for you to plug in to charge your electronics devices. Excellent transportation system. Would definitely go for it again when I head to other part of the South Korea.", April 2018
283,4.0,A moderate speed express train ,"Took an early train at 5.30am from Seoul Station to Busan to catch a bus ride to  Changwon city to visit cherry blossom boulevards.

288,3.0,Good clean train but not user friendly,"The train seats are clean and comfortable. However, the ticket system can be improved on. From Seoul Station subway, you need to buy a ticket for entry to the KTX terminal. Then when you arrive at the airport, you need to get a refund on the subway ticket. Not very friendly for tourists.", March 2018
289,5.0,Ktx from Seoul to Busan,"I bought the Korail Pass for foreigners as it offered unlimited rides for the day, which was cheaper and timings more flexible than 2 1-way tickets. There are discounts for groups of 2 pax and above. We had made ticket reservations a day in advance but missed our return train. No need to panic as trains between Seoul and Busan depart every 15 min or so. We were prepared to pay a penalty fee if needed, but maybe because we had the 1-day Korail Pass, which offered unlimited rides for the day, the staff only cancelled the departed train tics and gave new tics. No penalty fees! However as it was a last min reservation, we weren't able to sit together. At least it's better than standing tics for 2 hr 40 min!!There're no food bars on the train so be prepared to buy food for long journeys from the station's many food outlets. Luggage racks are available at the ends of each train carriage but it's small so best to go early to reserve spots for your luggage. Usually the train gets into the platform about 20 min before the departure time.", March 2018

It just took us 2 hours 45 minutes.We pre-booked our tickets at Seoul station, if you don't do this in advance you risk not getting a seat and will have to stand for your journey. There were vending machines on board if you wanted refreshments and Seoul station had tons of coffee shops and restaurants if you want snacks for your journey. Pretty much all KTX trains to Busan depart from platform 6, the screens in the stations are clear so it should be obvious which platform is required.The seats were spacious and comfy and the views from Seoul to Busan were amazing! The TV screens in the carriages clearly display which stop is coming up.", March 2018
292,5.0,Exceptional Experience,We took the KTX from Seoul to Daegu (and back) and thoroughly enjoyed our experience.  We chose first class to get a reserved seat.
