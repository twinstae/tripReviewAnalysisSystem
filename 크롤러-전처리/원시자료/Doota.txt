6,2.0,Innisfree and English,"Minimum half of the workers don’t speak korean, especially the ones in Innisfree. I beg your pardon, but not knowing what Sale and Discount means? Why are you even working in a place with full of foreigners", July 2019
7,4.0,Typical modern shopping mall,"This is one of the largest fashion malls in Dongdaemun area. There are many designer shops, luxury brand stores, shops selling cosmetics, accessories, clothing, cafes and restaurants. It was lively and crowded in the evening. I went to the basement food court and had my dinner.", June 2019
8,3.0,Less than average,"There are nothing about this store for it to stand out among the numerous retail offerings in Seoul -- so why waste time? The merchandise is offered at all the better outlets at equivalent prices -- the Food Court at Doota is inferior to that of most every other store in town and even the terrace is small, cluttered, enclosed and disappointing. Don't waste your precious time!", June 2019

11,4.0,Pretty good,"Guide recommended this place. Shake shack was prominent on the ground floor, very large mall with emphasis on local designers which set it apart from the Lottes. Affordable and stylish enough, Wife happy!  Good sports section too.", March 2019
12,3.0,It’s kind of boring,"Had some time to browse around in the mall. The mall was okay for us. They sell what most malls in the world sell. A lot of things mostly cosmetic and perfume, bags, clothes, etc. It operates from 10am ish until 5am. Unbelievable! There is a famous restaurant next to the mall, Shake Shack. We wanted to try it sooo bad, because we have heard about it for many many years but the one in Dongdaemun is not halal. Right across the mall is Dongdaemun History and culture park. The mall is easily accessible to subway stations.", July 2018
13,3.0,Just another mall,, July 2018
14,3.0,Shopping for Insomaniacs,, December 2018
15,3.0,Crowded mall,I suspect lots of tour buses offload their tour groups here in front of the mall which explain why this place is so packed with tourists. You can also find a food court at the basement., December 2018
16,3.0,Mall,"Just like other mall. Heaven for shopping person. They gave food court. Not many variations of food though, still in affordable price, came in a big portion. I suggest you buy 2 portions of meal for 3 person. There is Arirang shop, where sell snacks and souveniers too.", December 2018
17,3.0,A good shot for the tourists if you are attentive!,, October 2018
18,3.0,"Decent, but overpriced.","We went here for a family outing because there’s a Tayo Kid’s Cafe on the 5th floor. The cafe itself was very clean and our kid enjoyed it, but it was way expensive compared to similar Kid Cafes around the city. We looked around the shops and the clothes were really cute, but they also seemed overpriced. (Not paying $40 for a kid’s sweatshirt, thanks.) It was also a little frustrating that they kept suggesting we go to the duty free store. (We live here, so we weren’t interested.) There’s a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf on the 3rd floor with some outdoor seating, which was nice for reading for a few minutes.", November 2018
19,4.0,All in 1 mall,Got a brochure from the tourist information office and found 2 freebies in it - 1. Free face mask 2. 5000krw voucher to use in the food court. Why not? The discounts provided in the book is also good (with Conditions so do check before purchase) if you are looking to spend in the duty free section of doota. Only thing is stuff are priced in USD at duty free and the deals they offer are slightly different from the regular shops. Only place I found a pink fong shop that sells the mic in English! (the brand that started the baby shark fever). Also super happy they have a supermarket called no brand that sells a lot of goods at really affordable prices when compared to your convenience stalls. Overall a good mall to hang out in if you can't sleep as they close late., October 2018
20,1.0,Totally Crap,, September 2018
21,5.0,"Great place to shop for clothing, accessories, and souvenirs","Great place to shop for souvenirs.  I personally rested for a short while at Auntie Anne's on the 4th floor, but still explored all floors.  We just bought 2 articles of clothing and 3 pieces of jewelry.  Definitely not many options for guys, but a paradise for someone looking to shop for gals!", September 2018
22,5.0,best place to buy souveniers,"in this mall you can find makeup products and any other things for tourist you can chance the bill to a receipt for tax refund ( i think the place is at 1st floor near the laneige counter) . i visit a place called ""arirang shop"" in this shop you can get discount for tourist and you can get any kind of souveiers.", March 2018
23,5.0,Shopping mecca for fashionistas!,"Great selection of unique Korean brands by up and coming local designers.. Mostly ppeal to younger clientele who are fashion-conscious and seek the trendiest clothes and accessories.  Carefully curated boutiques spread out over many floors, with many good dining options mixed in between.  Prices are neither the lowest nor negotiable, unlike some others in Dongdaemun district...  But in my humble opinion, Doota is the best one-stop shopping destination for serious fashion-forward shoppers!", June 2018
24,3.0,Landmark building in east of city,"Shopping mall located inside the Doosan white building close to Dongdaemun. Food court in the basement. Shopping mall floors up to and including 6th floor.

Haha. Though we stroll around a little bit, Doota Mall is a variety of expensive clothes (for me) lol - There are lots of Branded Stores.", November 2016
41,4.0,Prepare your cash,"Doota Mall is in Dongdaemun Plaza. You get off at the Dongdaemun Design & Arts Center subway station, walk out of the DDP, and cross the street. You can't miss it. It has a LINE store on the G/F, and other coffee shops and women's shopping for days. The best part about our experience here was the Doota Duty Free, accessible via LINE store on the left side - cheaper skincare than in Myeongdong! I also LOVE their hawker-style food court with two levels to choose from. HUGE SERVINGS for 10,000-11,000 won! There's also an Olive Young on the 3rd or 4th floor for those who still don't have enough makeup and skincare in their luggage.", June 2017
42,3.0,Not as fancy as expected!,"A lot of people recommended us to visit and shop at this mall but what we experienced was not as fancy as expected.

43,5.0,Fun shopping,Love this place. The women's fashion section on the second floor is very very tempting. So many to choose from. Prices are varied depending on the items.

48,4.0,Fashion and more!,"If you are into shopping and fashion then you should definitely visit Doota. Keep in mind that prices are not that cheap and can get as expensive as a department store. Even though I don't spend too much money here, I enjoy checking out the current fashion trend in Korea. There are unique designers and each of them have their own style. The building goes from basement to the 6th floor and each floor is categorized of women, men, shoes, bags, accessories, kids and food court. The mall is open till late at night so I roam around when I'm jetlagged and can't sleep. I recommend that you visit early in the morning before all the tourists come shopping around noon.", November 2016
49,3.0,"Location is good, but.....","At the central of Dongdaemun, a very convenience place.  However, the area is too small and you have to wait the lift to and from G/F.  Means you may waste 5 minutes or more from 1/F down to G/F in critical season.", December 2016

55,4.0,Great selection but pricey,"This mall was a great respite after going through the monotony of the Dongdaemun shopping centre cookie cutter shops (although we did manage to pick up a couple of things there).

62,3.0,Disappointed ,I've heard a lot about Doota mall and I might expect a lot but the clothes is the same the price is kind of expensive compared to the quality of the other store. The good thing about it is that it open up to the midnight and until 5 am, August 2016
63,3.0,Expensive,"The items sold here are very expensive.. Took a walk around in the mall but did not manage to buy anything. Unless you are into designers items and willing to spend that much amount of money, I think it is not really suitable for normal shopping with items of reasonable price.", December 2015
64,3.0,Ok for a visit but,I won't buy anything in Doota- it has grown into a landmark but everything in Dongdaemun is more expensive than elsewhere.

67,3.0,Expensive and uninteresting,"Totally gentrified thus expensive. I'm not sure if there's a significant difference in quality between the designer clothes of Doota and the other Korean brands that you can find in Myeongdong or even in small shops at the subway stations. Not convinced and not amused, not even a bit. Come here, if you insist on feeling special or want to express your girlfriend/wife/gal friends. Personally, I'm not really drawn to overly bright stores, it always gives a superficial and unfriendly vibe to them. So in other words, expensive and nothing intriguing really to see here.", August 2015
68,5.0,Great shopping place! ,"What a fun place to shop!  The experience alone was worth the visit. The shops stay open really late so if you need things to do after dinner and karaoke, go check it out.  The staff working at the mall were all very friendly.", May 2016
69,4.0,Wide selection of local designers and international brands - tax refund in store,, May 2016
70,3.0,Expensive,"Doota isnt exactly a great place to shop unless you are into designer clothes, It is also no longer as cheap as it used to be years ago. I will suggest going to hello APM instead.", May 2016
71,3.0,same item with multiple prices,"If you care about $5-7 price differences, then make sure you shop around the entire mall before you buy something. I bought a long sleeve shirt at $22. Felt really stupid when I saw the same shirt sold at around $18 and $15. I'm not talking about bargaining prices. The listed price was literally different at different floors... But I am still happy with all the shirts I got. So.. just be aware of it.", May 2016

73,4.0,korean souvenir at arirang shop (Doota),"if you need various korean souvenir in one place you could try the arirang shop in doota(5th floor). the price is affordable, relatively lower than the price at namdaemun or myeoung dong market. very recommended, except if you are hard bargainer and really like the challenge to bargain in the market (maybe only 10% lower)", April 2015

75,3.0,An nice department store specializing in mid-range goods with a great basement food court.,"I found the department stores in Dongdaemun to be in three categories, mid to higher range such as Doota and Lotte Fitin, mid range like Good Morning City and Milgore and lower end such as Pyounghwa Clothing Market.  What I really like about Doota was the food court on the basement (B1) level.  There was a great selection of food that did not cost that much.  It was obviously a popular place for the lunch crowd.  We ate there at least three times.  And, they have great free wifi.  We were able to call home on VOIP a couple of times from here.", February 2016
76,3.0,Lots of fashion finds.,"This mall is overwhelmingly vast, with lots of floors and a variety of fashion finds. They have womenswear, menswear, children's wear and even sportswear. The merchandise don't come cheap though, as they are mostly brand-name goods.", December 2015

81,3.0,Just Another Department Store,"The department store was located at Dongdaemum.  We went to the top floor and started coming down.  No big surprise as a department stores.  Perhaps, you can find local design but the price is not cheap - mid range products.", December 2015
