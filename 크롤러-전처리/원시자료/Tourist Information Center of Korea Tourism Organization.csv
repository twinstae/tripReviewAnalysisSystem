0,1.0,Bad experience.,Very bad service to tourist. Ms Jina. If you’re not ready to be a service oriented person why be on the line? The place is not friendly for tourist to ask information., February 2020
1,5.0,한국 관광 정보를 구하세요,한국을 여행하는 분들에게 정보를 얻기 좋은 곳입니다. 무료로 한복 체험도 할수 있고 한식을 먹어 볼수도 있어서 추천합니다. Recommend biz tourists near Gwanghwamoon area who do not have much time to look aroud Seoul or Korea. This is good place to learn Korea culture and cusine as well as try Korean traditional costume., October 2019
2,1.0,Veiled threat,"I brought luggage cause I needed help with camping in Korea. They were friendly and helpful, then suddenly the employee I was speaking to suggested I go to the elevator, go down to the first floor and leave the building. She said I had too much luggage. In the west, that sort of suggestion is more of a threat that they will call security or the police in you, but they are too cowardly to make a clear threat.I think they like to judge people based on their appearance and they see me as a piece of garbage. I guess they feel okay with it and won't mind a few people being made aware that they are greedy, dishonest, phony people. In my opinion.I felt hostility so I didn't want to stick around to learn about their cultural heritage. I'm not in a mood to be sensitive to their culture, right now.", September 2019
3,4.0,Useful place to pick up tourist maps and general information,"This Tourist Information Centre is located in a large modern office building. I must have been very slow on the day that I visited as I thought that the place was restricted to the 2nd floor and so spent my whole time wandering around there. My impression was that it was quite modern & highly organised with a plethora of leaflets, maps and little booths describing many things to do and places to visit in the country. I grabbed a bunch of stuff which I thought could be helpful, acknowledged the fact that they also had a little coffee shop area to add to the other 88.500 odd coffee shops in this country (2017 figures!!!) and went out to find somewhere nearby to have breakfast.Unlike me, if you come here (which you should do) you might want to also visit the other floors and tell me about them on this platform :-)", October 2018
4,5.0,Its a MUST!,"First thing when you arrive at seoul as a tourist please find this place! Very informative and entertaining. Added, you can wear hanbok for FREE and take picture. Friendly staffs and you wont regret like us. I go there also after recommended by my friend. We walked from our hostel to here. Its took about 15 - 20 mins. Lastly, dont forget to come here and have a good day!", May 2018
5,4.0,K-Hub Tour,"This was a fun tour, if you have time do the health scan..AMAZING!!! The tour has a lot of interactive parts you can see actual KDrama stars, I did, we actually saw two. The gift shop was disappointing and NO K-Pop items at all. The gifts they do have are basically Station logos nothing more. Kevin was great and the lunch is amazing, the best part. It's good for filler.", June 2018
6,3.0,Some of the activities were for expats working in Seoul,There used to be a few handicraft sessions for tourists on Wednesdays and Thursdays. There were none open to 'tourists' during my last visit to Seoul. Sad., December 2017
7,4.0,"Information center, culinary exhibition, free hanbok","We visited this place on our way to Myeongdong (from Cheonggyecheon).We saw an awesome culinary exhibition on the second floor. There was a free hanbok at fourth floor, but the queue was very long. We decided to try free hanbok in another tourist information center.", January 2018
8,5.0,A must go place if you want know about lot about Korean cultures under one roof......,"This centre occupies the 2nd to 5th floor- within an office building complex. The tourists information centre is on the 2nd floor, with a small cafe within.Every floor has a different aspect showcasing rich Korean cultures ie Korean cuisines, history, cultures, etc.On the 5th Cultural products promo centre, visitors used free coupons to put on hanbok & take pictures. Also another sector to try out making a personalised character strap or magnet.However, the staff at both the hanbok & especially the handicraft sections( 2 young girls) are not very friendly. Makes us feel unwelcome with their cold attitudes!Seems like they don't like foreign tourists - an irony as to why this place is set up for ie to promote understanding of Korean cultures to foreigners/tourists. They are not warm nor helpful when you ask something.But the lady on the information counter on 3rd floor Culinary culture exhibition section was the extreme opposite. Very warm, friendly, helpful & always smile when see guests. She gave us the free coupons for 5th floor events without us even asking.So was the guy on the 2nd floor information counter ( English).Definitely we would recommend s trip here if in Seoul.", November 2017
9,4.0,Great place for free and indoor activities,Here is one stop center for tourist to get any information regarding South Korea. You can come here if you need a lil bit fresh up after a long walk in the city center of Seoul. You can take all the brochures as your guidance and also you can ask the staff here. For muslims traveler there provide a very comfortable prayer room divide men and women section. You also can try free hanbok (Korean traditional attire) for FREE at level 5 of this building., November 2016
10,5.0,Great staff,I want to thank the staff that is on the streets of Seoul. You can usually find them wearing cowboy hats. We were lost and found them. They called several shops to make sure they carried what we were looking for. Gave us bus direction and found the number of the bus we needed to take as well as writing the information in Korean for us. You can't get better service then that. I want to thank Noh Jiyoung  and An Kwangwoo your kindness. Your help was greatly appreciated and without them we would have been lost., June 2017
11,3.0,To get some info on other cities in Korea,"Nice and spacious place. Some events on Korean culture. Small coffee shop where you can get some snack. It is not enough but they have some brochures on Jeju, Gyeongju and Busan. Good to visit before heading for country sides.", June 2017
12,3.0,Overall great place but terrible attitude of staff at hanbok experience section ,"Awesome center for tourists with fun photo booths free for use and resting areas. Go for hanbok wearing experience on the fifth floor where you can either wear the hanbok of your choice and take photos inside the Centre or wear outside for an hour. Wish the staff at that the hanbok section could be friendlier. Could hear them murmuring ""so annoying"" in korean without a smile and that's not nice especially that's a tourist center. To be honest if you want to impress and attract tourists as the purpose of this centre, please hire staffs who can give good impression.", May 2017
13,5.0,Don't miss Korean Cuisine on 4th floor,"My wife and I were seeking an authentic Korean food experience when we came across the Korean Cuisine Cultural Centre on the fourth floor of K-Style Hub. It offers individually prepared Korean dishes while you wait and watch. The staff are fantastic explaining what goes into each dish and willing to help you make your selection (s). Meals are prepared,  in an open kitchen as you watch if you choose, from all fresh ingredients. Seating are  bench style tables with comfortable padding and can accommodate up to eight diners. A separate banquet room is available for demonstrations and/or dining. Interested in learning Korean preparation, cooking classes are also available.Overall an excellent meal and experience.", April 2017
14,5.0,Highly recommended! Best free activity in Seoul,"My mum and I went to K-Style hub this month and it was actually the best place we have visited in Seoul.They offer free 15-minute hanbok fitting and you can take photos everywhere in the premise wearing hanbok. We took some beautfiul photos and it was very fun.We also took a free mulberry paper craft class. Decorating paper doll and paper shoes with mulberry paper was much harder than we anticipated hahaa. Although the teaching staff could only speak korean, they were incredibly supporting, friendly and helpful. All the exhibited paper dolls and shoes were made by the lady who worked there, impressed! If you are interested in free mulberry paper craft class, you can go to search ""K-Style Hub"" on facebook and find a coupon for it.3/F has an exhibition about korean cuisine. It is small but thorough and interesting.4/F is an open kitchen + eatery for paid cooking class and dining. We didnt join any but the furnishing looked very nice.", March 2017
15,5.0,Fun and FREE!,"Fun place to visit with or without kids. People there were very friendly. We took hilarious pictures with K Pop stars, and loved trying on the hanbok. You can also ""virtually tour Korea"" with virtual reality glasses. This is a great place to get brochures for tourist attractions around Korea. See pics for brochure with hours and directions.", January 2017
16,4.0,A must go!!,"We alighted at Jonggak station Line 1 to K-Style Hub, immediately as our 1st destination.  This de facto the Korea Tourism Place is fast becoming a famous attraction that is less known to most international tourists! It is a one-stop complex provides information to meet all tourists' needs.  Beyond just a tourist information center there are exhibition halls and even sales of local specialty products! The hub is divided into 4 segments, with the Tourist Information Center found at second level, Korean Food Exhibition and Experience Halls on the third and forth levels respectively, and an Art Market Hall on the 5th level. We spent some time at L2 asking the officers for some tourist advice and also to take a break/rest.  Browsing through the many brochures while sipping our (Korean) latte.! Can even see part of the Cheonggyecheon Stream.  Only visited the 3rd level to get some souvenirs at the Korean Food Culture Exhibition Hall. There’s simple food sampling, hands-on and explanation of the famed Korean ginseng & kimichi too. Good for a 1st introduction to Korea’s diverse experience!Do watch this place as it is very likely to move-up the must-visit in Seoul soon.", October 2016
17,4.0,experience hanbok,"I went to K-style Hub to experience try hanbok, I thought it was very good experience for me, I thought that hanbok is very beautiful custom in Korea but it was too difficult to wear if no one help me also I thought it was hot that too wear hanbok. I think if you want to experience and know more about the Korea, you can go to there also ot was free for one hour if you try hanbok,you can choose the hanbok as you like and there are specially-assigned person helped you to wear it.if you wear hanbok and walk in the street, there are some foreign find you to take a photo with them, that was a good and unforgettable experience for me to experience the Korea culture, I strongly suggest if people want to try hanbok, I thought you can go there to experience and you will like it.", June 2016

19,4.0,Useful information at the Tourist Information Center of Korea in Seoul Korea,"This place offers a friendly first contact with Seou. Two friendly employees helped us plan to visit. The first one apologized for not speaking fluent English, but was able give anyways brief information and explanation and kindly told us to wait for the second whoh one more fluent. The second lady confirmed the monuments to see and gave us another map pointing the spots to visit. This place is obviously highly recommended if you are in town visiting. It also a virtual reality gallery with some videos to enjoy with the glasses and a virtual photo booth with famous Korean artists that appear on the screen besides you after you press a button with their name and pose for a picture. The same building offers other things on other floors like a food experience. Behind the desks there are more maps and magazines with more information in other languages.", October 2016

21,5.0,Try Hanbok Experience for Free!,"This place shows us that Korean Government works really really good in developing Korean Tourism. They facilitates tourists visiting Korea with such good service for free. If you want to try hanbok, come to this place. One of the most famous tourism center located in Myeongdong and you can try Hanbok for free! Make sure you register your self early because usually you have to wait 3-4 hours until your turn to try the Hanbok come.You can also got free drinks for free if you're subscribing your self to their facebook page. Also make sure that you ask them the wifi password because the wifi here works so well and it's also for free!One negative thing about this place is that some of the workers are not really friendly and communicated to the tourist. They're even not smiling when I tried to smile to them. But what can I expect from a totally free services, they works hard tho! :)", May 2015
22,3.0,If you have travel questions in Chinese or English this is the place.,"This place is created to serve, inform and entertain the tourists. It even offers medical tourism center.

23,5.0,Make sure you come here for an unforgettable souvenir!,"I had read on a blog about coming here to try on traditional Korean hanbok and take souvenir photographs for free so when we were recently in Seoul we had to do it!It was somewhat easy to find and when we entered we immediately encountered the hanbok costume display. We were able to put on the color of our choice and wear them for about 10-15 minutes as we walked around the tourism office and posed for photos with several backdrops. They even had a tripod and a few selfie-sticks available if you didn't bring one. It was free, it was awesome, and we treasure the pictures! Don't miss this when you are in Seoul.Now, as for the activities of the Tourism Info Center: there are staff who speak a variety of languages who are able to help you with whatever you need. We availed ourselves of an English speaker who happily provided train information (times and prices) for our trip to Busan.The center also offers free classes to foreigners for Korean cooking and handicrafts. They offer more than just brochures here (although those are helpful, too!) and if you're interested in learning more about Korea (and getting a great souvenir photo) come here!", July 2015
