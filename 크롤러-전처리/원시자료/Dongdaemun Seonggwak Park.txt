1,4.0,Small park near Heunginjimun Gate,"When I came to Dongdaemun to view the Heunginjimun Gate, I noticed there is an uphill path just across the road, alongside the old Seoul City Wall. I decided to climb up for a better view of the surrounding area. There is this small park along the hillside. It was quiet, with only a few locals there.
