Wery special", December 2019
1,5.0,Stunning,"Our visit to the Jeongdong Theatre was the highlight of our trip to Korea.We saw ""The Palace: Tale of Jang Noksu"".The grace and artistry of the performers is gripping.It is a microcosm of Korean culture.The theatre is 15 minute walk from the Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Royal Guard Change.There is a cafe next door selling lovely snacks,cakes and drinks.We bought the tickets online for about £16 each.", August 2019
2,4.0,A very entertaining and high-tech performance,"While this is a very commercial presentation, it is very high quality, and performed by very talented people.  Well worth including in your visit to get a taste of Korean music and dance.", October 2018
3,5.0,Entertaining Show,"I saw ""The Palace"" show with my friends. The show is a story about a king and his concubine. It's easy to understand because there aren't a lot if dialogue and they have subtitle in English, Chinese, and Japanese for foreigners.", April 2019
4,4.0,Entertaining and amazing cultural show,"I thoroughly enjoyed this 75 minute “The Palace” performance which was easy to understand and follow, in part due to the expressive acting, but also the English narrative provided on the screen to the side of the stage. Interesting folktale told with imagination and style. Wow! Such amazing dancing and percussion skills; if you have a dancer or a drummer in your family, GO to this performance because you’ll be amazed at the talent exhibited. I purchased my ticket 15 minutes before showtime and got an excellent seat (the theater design is such that I don’t think any of the seats would be ‘bad.’). The performers interacted with the audience in a fun and entertaining way and the pacing was fast enough that I think younger children would stay engaged. The interior was cool, which was refreshing after a hot afternoon, but might be chilly after awhile. Short walk from the City Hall metro stop. Definitely worth the $43 ticket!", May 2019
5,4.0,Good place to rest on travel near,"C ( 19.05.08 ) Though I didn't see play in this theater, but the inside was good place to rest. The theater was located in B1, and the floor was cafe and place to rest. The floor had wide space and sculpture. If travel on this area, there would be good place to make a pause.", May 2019
6,5.0,Extraordinary experience,"Very nice experience, I would suggest to everyone visiting Seoul to book a ticket for performance in this theater. It was nicely done, good artistic performances and fun, all in one. We have got the cheapest tickets, but the view was still very good.", March 2019
7,5.0,Traditional Korean Theatre Beautifully Done,"We saw ""The Palace"" at Jeongdong Theatre and were blown away by the performance. I am a high school drama teacher, so I'm often looking to see traditional pieces when we travel. This theatre didn't disappoint. The small venue has nothing but excellent seating - there isn't a bad seat in the house. The performance showcased traditional costumes, stories, dancing, music, and drama and was thoroughly engaging. I highly recommend taking in a piece here if you are in Seoul. Tip - check out the 1/2 price tickets available on Wednesdays. :)", July 2018
8,5.0,Fascinating traditional Korean Theatre,"I saw the afternoon production 'The Palace' in July 2018.  It is a traditional type story beautifully performed in traditional costume.  It is all dance, music and mime so there is no language issue and it is accessible to all.  At the beginning screens on each side of the stage describe the story in Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese so that you know what is going to happen, and then before each scene the same screens tell you what is going to happen in that scene in the same languages.  I love Theatre in general and wanted to see traditional Korean theatre.  I found it a delight.  It is 75 minutes long with no interval, which was about the right length. I think younger children might get bored after a while.", July 2018
9,5.0,Amazing and spectacular performance of traditional Korean culture!,"This was probably one of the best performances I've ever seen. It's like a historical K-drama come to life, but even better and more engaging. Every scene was suspenseful and kept me at the edge of my seat. As a foreigner, it was easy to follow the story as this is a non-verbal performance. Before the beginning of each scene, there were also captions (in English, Korean, Chinese and Japanese) summarising the scene, allowing the audience to have a better understanding of it.The performers were also professional, passionate and extremely talented. One unique thing about this performance was the engagement of the audience at the beginning of the performance. It was like a ""game"" between the audience and the atmosphere was lively and it was fun! I find it brilliant how the performers managed to convey such strong emotions and message without verbal communication and I think the production team did a wonderful job in this performance. The whole setup was extravagant and detailed and the use of stage props also made the performance very captivating and special.For a performance that was only a short one and a half hour, I felt like I invested so much emotions and feelings into it. Seriously. Time passed so fast without even realising it. I'd say my time was well-spent and I had a great afternoon at Jeongdong Theater thanks to this wonderful performance :)Also, there were times where the performers would appear along the aisle of the audience seats and I thought that was pretty cool since you get to see them up close! Photo/video-taking was not allowed during the performance until the last 5 minutes of the performance and after the end of the performance, there's also a photo-taking session with the main characters of the performance!I highly recommend anyone in Seoul or planning to visit Seoul to watch this performance and I don't think you will regret this experience! :)", April 2018
10,5.0,A modern Theater in Seoul,"What an amazing experience... we watched a theatrical performance play "" Lotus - a flower comes out once more"". The story is told with beautiful and splendid music and dances. The performers and their outfits were superb. Not to miss if you're in Seoul.", May 2017
11,5.0,Terrific Performance,"I attended a performance of  ""Lotus"" last night. It was excellent. The performers are obviously highly trained professionals and the production values were very high as the costumes, lighting and set were really good. The sorcerer's dance and the Queen's struggling with jealousy were amazing. The cast were not only wonderful dancers but excellent drummers and actors.", October 2017
12,5.0,Real art,"I just watched ""Lotus"" last night. It was so good that my friend and I was really satisfied. The dancer/actors are professionals. The witch's dance with power , beauty, and mystery impressed me most.", August 2017
13,2.0,Disappointed ,Was recommended by a local. However I am disappointed towards Youll. Predictable storyline. Over price for the experience., November 2016
14,3.0,An improvement from Miso....,I last attended a performance at this theatre two years ago to see a performance called miso... it was really boring... can see that they have tried to improve and although it is hard to make opera interesting it is a good effort....the show shows how boring it would have been even if you were the king of Korea anywhere earlier than a hundred years ago, October 2016
15,5.0,Youll a magical and wonderful show,"I've just seen the show Youll and I wanted to share with you my thought : AMAZING !!! A little theater, a little troup but what a splendid show !! The original soundtrack, the acting, the costumes, the stage set everything was perfect ! I wish they can produce in Paris really and moreover it was during Chuseok (kind of korean thanksgiving holiday) so there was a special price ticket with performances and traditionnal games included ! If I could I would have put 10 stars out of 5 haha ! Well that was a very nice night in Seoul !", September 2016
16,4.0,An entertaining night,"(Youll) A short performance with a simple straightforward story, but the acting and performers are fantastic. A good way to spend a few hours during a night in Seoul.", July 2016
17,4.0,Youll Show - Traditional Mixed with Contempory,"The MISO Show has ended and now playing is Youll.  Easy to follow with the English subtitles on one side of the stage. Dramatic lighting, dance, pantomime, contemporary music mixed in with the traditional, and energy of the actors will keep you captivated throughout.  Good indoor activity if your legs are tired from all the walking and it's a rainy day.", June 2016
18,4.0,Youll show - nicely performed - great for children,"I enjoyed the Youll show, although I thought it was best suited to a young audience.  I had hoped for more traditional dancing and costuming, but this was a traditional story given a modern twist.  Easy to follow, with English phrasing on boards at the side of the stage.  I'm a bit of a theatre ""addict"" so found this performance to be quite ""pantomime"" standard.  Cute fairies with their feather wands...  Nice way to spend an hour, but wouldn't say it was a ""must see"".", May 2016
19,5.0,"Excellent show, highly recommended","We saw a flyer for the show Youll at Jeongdong theatre and were apprehensive. Not speaking Korean we were worried we wouldn't have a clue what was going on, but the show itself was very easy to follow - there wasn't a lot of dialogue but the majority of it had English (and Chinese) subtitles at the side of the stage but even without these it would have been very easy to follow. The traditional Korean dance, singing, music etc was excellent to watch and I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Seoul, myself and my partner loved it.", June 2016
20,5.0,Youll show was great!,A great way to experience traditional Korean music and dance in a contemporary setting. Highly recommended!, May 2016
21,4.0,Great Blend of traditional meets Ballet and Martial Arts,"Great Quaint Theater a Tucked away near Palace walls. We showed up to a surprise free concert in the courtyard. Blues, rock and Jazz with an open coffee shop and bar on two levels to the side and lots of open seating. Very pleasant for a date or with family. The performance in the theatre was a blend of Korean traditional music and dance, martial arts and ballet! Very beautiful and interesting!!!", May 2016
22,5.0,Amazing Show,This was an unexpected stop while out with friends and it turned out to be one of the highlights of our Korea trip. Definitely stop in and see a show!, April 2016
23,5.0,Pure Perfection and Joy,"I was on a trip to Asia, 8 countries and 14 cities and had the fortune of assisting to some shows in cities like Seul, Tel Aviv and Istambul and I have to say and share that the MISO show that presents Korean traditions, dance, drama en aesthetics is a must!Pure colorful perfection and execution. Don´t miss it if you live in Seul or visit the city!", December 2015
24,5.0,Story of Secretary Bae,"Just left an outstanding performance of traditional Korean theatre art which was seamlessly interwoven with modern digital graphics. The Story of Secretary Bae was offered in pansori style (a Korean singing introduction) with English, Chinese, and Japanese subtitles on side screens. The exceptional cast, however, had no need for any of these languages since their expressions and moves told the whole story. My heart is still racing from the great storm at sea, acted out in Chapter 3. Well worth a visit. Read all reviews here (more eloquent and detailed than mine).", December 2015
25,5.0,Breath taking traditional stories in theater,"It was in the evening of our second day in Seoul that went to this theater. The way it was performed was fantastic , the stage and the lightings left no questions . It is about the ancient stories and myths and they have all been given life and brought to life by the professional performers who are wearing traditional costumes . There is no talking in the performance. The stage is being changed regularly based on the subject of each episode . Each performance takes almost one hour . At the end of the performance, back to the waiting hall , the performers are present for taking pictures.", October 2015
26,5.0,Amazing,"This is a theatrical experience lasting around 1.5 hours, there is a narrator singing at points in Korean, however, there is a screen offering English subtitles through the performance.All the actors are in traditional Korean dress offering a cultural blast of dance and colour..With an amazing traditional drum performance at the endWell worth a visit", September 2015
27,5.0,great  show,Last  night  was  my  second  time  at this  show .  I saw  the  performance  10 years  ago  when  the  now director was the star of  the  show .  Great  dancing  with  music . The  finale is rousing  and I  defy any  body  to not  feel  the drums  during  the  ending . Don't  even  try  to  make  or take  a picture  or phone  call  when  the  play starts. The ushers are right   there  to politely  remind  you . After  the  show  there   is  a  meet  and  greet  for  photos . I  recommend  this  as a  must  see ., April 2015
28,5.0,Must-Watch Play: Miso Baebijang-jeon @ Jeongdong Theater,"Last May 2014, I was able to watch a popular traditional Korean play at Jeongdong Theater called Miso. Miso, a Korean word that means “beautiful smile” or “magandand ngiti” in Filipino. Miso is the No. 1 Korean Traditional Arts Performance loved by people from all over the world. Starting last April 2014, Jeongdong Theater presents its new performance for 2014 which is Miso: Baebijang-jeon. It is my first time to watch Miso and for me the performance is very interesting and funny at the same time. I did not have dull moments while watching the show which makes it MUST-SEE performance when you go to Seoul. Baebijang-jeon is not just an ordinary play as the story is told through traditional Korean dance, Samulnuri (traditional percussion quartet) and other Korean traditional instruments as well. The combination of the traditional dance and music will definitely capture the attention of all the audience not only Koreans but also foreigners like me as well who loves musical performances. For me it is like watching my favorite sageuk drama live and up-close since we had a good seats in the theater. The whole production is perfect from the background, to the music, the cast (all of them are handsome and pretty!!!), and the colorful and vibrant costumes used in the play. If I want to I can watch the play over and over again and you don’t need advanced level of Korean to understand it because they provide English, Chinese, and Japanese translations on screen. Lastly, one thing I like in Jeongdong Theater is that the size of the theater is not so big and not so small either just the perfect size for you to watch the play and you can see the cast really close without using any binoculars. After the show, you can take pictures together with the cast as souvenir for free.Performances are held twice a day (Closed on Mondays): one in the afternoon 16:00 and at night 20:00. The tickets for this musical range from ₩ 40,000 to ₩ 50,000. If you come early you can visit the nearby places like Jungmyeongjeon Hall, Jeongdong First Methodist Church, and Seoul Museum of Art before watching the show. To get to the theater you can either got to Seodaemun Station (Seoul Subway Line 5), Exit 5 or You can also go out from City Hall Station (Seoul Subway Line 1, 2), Exit 12 and just follow the stonewall road along Deoksugung Palace. #wowkoreasupporters", May 2014
29,5.0,Traditional & Colorful Korean Performance,"If you are interested in traditional Korean music and dance, this performance is for you. This musical performance is for everyone including those who don't speak Korean. Although it is entertaining for adults, my 3 years old seems bored and luckily didn't make any noise throughout the performance. So, I wouldn't suggest people who have small kids to watch this. Definitely worth the money compare to Nanta or other shows.", April 2014
30,5.0,So worth the time!,"I was on my first day in Seoul and jet lagged up to my eyeballs. This colorful, lively performance will get you going. Traditional instruments and garb. I don't speak an ounce of Korean but not a problem.  It's a small theatre....can't imagine any bad seats.", November 2013
31,4.0,"Entertaining, beautiful, interactive.","The Chongdong Theater is a cozy small theater. You probably have a good view on the stage from nearly every seat. However I wouldn't go for the front rows as you really have to look up the entire time. We were on the fifth row in the middle which was just excellent. The musical starts with the entire story (written) shown on a screen. Throughout the rest of the musical there will not be spoken so to know the story line beforehand is helpful. There's no language barrier or a problem with comprehension as the actors are just brilliant. Their expressions, together with the beautiful music played live on Korean traditional instruments, helps you understand everything perfectly. The show is not too long, 80 minutes without intermission which is just right. There are some interactive and funny parts which makes it all very entertaining. Having said that there are some intense parts which would make me advise against taking too young children.", October 2013
32,4.0,Korean culture experience..,You can have very various Korean music on this theater., August 2012
33,5.0,Don't miss this!,The Chongdong Theater provides a wonderful cultural experience (although a bit on the loud side).  I enjoyed being able to see and hear the traditional musical instruments and dances., May 2013
34,5.0,Something very Different.,"Really enjoyed the show - good music, great costumes, easy to understand. Some bits felt like a Korean version of Gilbert and Sullivan! We found the website for booking online a bit clunky so went to the box office to buy tickets - didn't open til 3pm - the 4pm show was already sold out so we booked for the later one. The audience was a little noisy as is often the case in this part of the world, but the staff did a reasonable job calming them down.", April 2013
35,5.0,Great musical to know a little more abt ancient Korea,Loved the musical. Like the love story. Was touched. The actor and actresses took photos after the show. Live singing n playing of instruments reminded me of broadway shows. Those who love broadway will definitely like this., October 2012
36,4.0,Great show,"In the Chongdong Theater the show running in August 2011 is Miso - an Original Korean Musical. The place was packed and you could tell everybody had a great night. The show is spectacular and a nice introduction to part of Korean culture, beautiful choreagraphy, lightning, costumes, live music, percursion, and some opera-style singing. At the end a 10 min part with two persons invited on stage I thought a bit too touristy, but still fun. After the show the public is invited in the court yard to participate in some dancing with the line-up and thereafter some photo opportunities. The Chongdong Theater is located behind the Deoksugung Palace, very close to city hall, and major hotels Lotte, Plaza, Westin Chosun, Ibis, Koreana, etc. When facing the  Deoksugung Palace park entry, with your back to City Hall, walk along the left palace walls, after 300m on your right side. Tickets 3 types based on better view: KRW 30,000-40,000-50,000.", August 2011
