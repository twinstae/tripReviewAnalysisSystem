0,3.0,Huge mall,The mall is connected to the metro station so it's quite convenient to reach. We went on the new year eve for the countdown fireworks but it was smaller scale and not as amazing as compared to the one in 2019. Seems to have a great mix of shopping and food options would consider to come back explore again., January 2020
1,5.0,Great Shopping Mall,This 7 story shopping mall has great restaurants and activities including a large movie theater with a 4D screen., July 2019
2,4.0,"Nice building, but its a building","I went into this shopping mall and its nice and expensive, there are some nice restaurants below.I went to the very top and the views are very nice although for me somehow it was a little confusing to get done and the staff kept pointing me in the wrong level, so I am writing this and not from the top of the tower so obviously made it done.", January 2020
3,3.0,Only go if you are planning on spending big money,"We visited the Lotte Tower as it was not far from The Westin where we were staying. There was a constant stream of people going in and out so we were intrigued. The entire place is full of designer shops, as well as the surrounding area. We compared prices and they were similar to what you would pay in Australia. Overall it was a bit of a letdown but interesting to see. Not a great selection for Men.", January 2020
4,3.0,personally overpriced,"for not being the tallest in the world & still having infrastructural issues during its construction; not even guaranteeing the view that would compensate for most of the price, i'd say this thing is overrated; even when you get to the top, some of the things are extra.. . ""buyer-beware""..", May 2019
