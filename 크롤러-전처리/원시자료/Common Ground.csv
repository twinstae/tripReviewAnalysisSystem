0,5.0,Cute place to take pictures ,The place looks very hippie. There are cute cafes too. But the clothes what they are sells there is a bit expensive., March 2020
1,5.0,Such a cool vibe!!!,The vibe of this place is just plain old cool.. the restaurants on the top floor are awesome and the shops are neat (But some are very pricey) - I saw a Dj booth in the main complex so I imagine there's some sort of a nightlife vibe here as well!, October 2019
2,4.0,Neat shopping inside shopping containers ,"If you have never seen how cool retailers can make boring shipping containers interesting, then you need to come and check this out. In one section they even had a DJ spinning tunes while you shopped!  There‚Äôs food and seating too to enjoy your time here.", November 2019
3,4.0,Go for the architecture,"Shopping center constructed completely with shipping containers. Well done, with great visual on the outside and inside. The shopping itself is mostly streetwear oriented, and a live DJ keeps things hopping. Good people watching spot.", November 2019
4,4.0,Unique place and good for photo taking,"Common Ground or Uncommon? Its truly uncommon to me. Using stacked containers to build up the structure for a shopping place is very unique, you can imagine you are walking around a sea port. I was there on a Sunday and it was rather quiet, but good for nice photo shoot without much distraction. Nothing much to shop for me so we only spent around 30 mins to walk around. Its very near to the train station, like 3 mins walk away so can be a drop by place when you are in Korea!", November 2019
5,4.0,Novel and worth a visit,"An interesting take on a stack of shipping containers. Refurbished with stairs and elevators....as good as any small shopping mall but with a difference, good food options too.", October 2019
6,1.0,Part 2 of Kitchen waiting,"The sad saga of my wait in the kitchen community kitchen continued... I believe the duty manager made an appearance.. asking me to go to the front desk!?!Apparently I was a ghost on my first visit.Then Rachel a good natured service staff from the caf√© showed up and also asked me to go to the front deskEventually (for some blizzard reasons of trust... alluded to in the 1st post) Head of Security... Moonlighting as F&B manager showed up with Rachael in tow.Hip Hip Horray.. cabinets unlocked so I can get a knife and chopping board... Lucky I don't need to cook a smorgasbord üòÅüòÖüòÇIt is apparent that guest trust, service or solutions (getting someone to unlock cupboards!) Was not top of the agenda for this cheap... Yet not fully functional nor cheerful site... Be warned that the initial price on Agoda or booking might be attractive.The on site kitchen facilitiy is far from useable unless you wait the better part of 48 mins", November 2019
7,4.0,Common ground for photos,"Came here for the mandatory photo. One may spend some time wandering around the shops and you may find something that you like, or just for a cuppa.", May 2019
8,4.0,One hipsters‚Äô corner.,"The architecture (or not) was very pleasing to the eye, very Instagrammable, houses some of the hype streetwear brands such as Vans, Fila, etc. Make sure you visit Index bookstore at rooftop level if you have a thing for books and stationery, the cute tiny place certainly gave a homey feeling when you entered. Didn‚Äôt try the food from the various restaurants and cafes as I was full, but the place looks okay for a bite and sightseeing.", September 2019
9,5.0,Funny time,"Until now, I still remember the time when I was in Korea. Specially, timing in Common Ground. Thanks to my Korean friend who lead me to there and I really love there.

11,4.0,Nice place for instagram photos,"It's a small shopping centre but looks really fun, and nice. There are couple of spots for taking cool photos. I enjoyed my experience here.", July 2019
12,3.0,Common Ground for Instagram,"Not gonna lie, this place is pretty cool for photoshooting. Using containers as buding blocks for a shopping and chilling spot, it gives a modern with a funky twist which makes this place stood out from any other place in Seoul.  If you're up for an indie-esque kind of photos, this place will provide the exact ground (pun intended) to explore the simple yet aesthetically minimalist shots. But it has limited space where one can have their photos being taken. One tip, bright or contrasting colours would fit you well against the blue backdrop.", May 2019
13,3.0,"Ok for photos, not that interesting for shopping ",Ok place to take some photos of something different but retail offer is pretty average and many pop up street stuff., April 2019
14,4.0,Would visit again for cake,"A cool shopping area made out of shipping containers. The shops inside range from cute stationary to popular sportswear brands and some Korean clothing shops. Nice to browse or shop if you like that. There is also a level with restaurants but we skipped those and went to the cafe serving rainbow cake. We ordered two smoothies and a rainbow cake with cream plus a red velvet cake with cream cheese. SO DELICIOUS. Massive, and yet I ate the whole thing. The smoothies were also very tasty and not sickeningly sweet so went well with the cake.", June 2019
15,3.0,Common Ground - Good place for taking photos,"Common Ground is a good place for taking photos but not too good for shopping as an outlet. Unlike the Outlets in Japan, it has relatively less designer-brand shops and the products there are actually quite expensive. However, the blue containers design of the outlet is fun and stylish.", June 2019
16,5.0,Special place for photo shooting  ,"It‚Äôs a hot place in Seoul fr photo shooting, use  blue cargoes to built that places, lots of shops and restaurants.Get the green line 2 subway, exit 6 at Konkuk uni, walk 3 mins straight. Easy to find it.", June 2019
17,3.0,Not a must do,Small amount of stores and cafes to visit. This place is more for photos in front of the containers. I wouldn't make it a priority to do.If you do visit make sure you have some other plans within the area doesn't take too long to go through every there., June 2019
18,3.0,A few small stores and a crowd at the parking lot,"I think people just come here to take a picture at the blue parking lot. I did that too. There are many small stores inside, you can buy some korean clothing & accessories. On the first floor I saw many streetwear. However, I feel like most of the people are outside on the parking lot, busy taking pictures. If you want that cool pic on instagram, you‚Äôd better come here early.", May 2019
19,3.0,Just for photo taking,"Nothing fancy for us, just our own opinion. This is a place just for photo taking only. Can visit if got extra time during visit in Seoul.", May 2019
20,4.0,Common ground - Many things you find in common interest,"A great place to find clothing, shoes, apparel the tucks the heart's strings.  Would not burn a hole in your pocket though as the prices are very reasonable.", December 2018
21,4.0,Unusual place to shop or dine,"This is a fairly small place of two main buildings linked together and made entirely from metal shipping containers. That makes for quite a quirky look from the outside, although you don't notice it that much inside.There are quite a few restaurants and cafes here too so it makes a good spot for some refreshments and a wander around the quirky shops. An hour here would be plenty as its not that big unless you're stopping for a meal.", April 2019
22,3.0,For photo taking,"This shopping mall is built by stacking up some 200+ containers over 3 stories. It is close to Konkuk Metro Station and recommended in my guidebook, so I went to check it out on a Sunday evening. It's not busy when I got there. I am more interested in the design of the compound than the stuff sold there. Apart from shops/stalls selling clothes/shoes and accessories/knick knacks, there are also a few cafes and restaurants, a bookshop and some exhibition area. There are also food trucks in the courtyard. In the evening, when the place was lit up, it's quite atmospheric. You could consider dropping by if you are in the area.", April 2019
23,2.0,Photo taking only. Not a must go.,Not a big place. Apparels sold here are on the high side and you can get them elsewhere. A good place for photo taking. You can give this place a miss if you don‚Äôt have time., April 2019
24,4.0,really simple but beautiful place,"definitely a place to visit when in korea. nice spots for photography and good food! i tried analog kitchen, was quite pricey but definitely food for value!!", January 2019
25,4.0,Unique and small complex,"C ( 18.01.04 ) I and my friend visited this complex on our way to Konkuk University station. There was small area, but had unique shape made by container. We visited at night, there was good atmosphere and mood.", January 2019
26,4.0,Worth visiting at night during Christmas time,"Interesting place where shops (mostly sports goods), restaurants and coffee shops are brought together ‚Äúin the grounds‚Äù. Spectacular view at night time during Christmas, nice getaway after touristy and historic places in Seoul", December 2018
27,2.0,"Overpriced hype, tiny space ","If you‚Äôre into paying a premium for food or like the hype, this is the place for you! There‚Äôs a range of shops, all at full price and quite expensive and some dining choices.We did check out all the containers but didn‚Äôt find anything special about it. Has potential but at the moment, a bit of a let down. I did pay ‚Ç©5500 for a coffee which was decent.", December 2018
28,3.0,Unique location but not unmissable,"Common ground is a unique shopping destination with a number of small shops and eateries (on the top floor). The place has two sections with one dedicated to mainly menswear while the other has a variety of stores with some womenswear. However, the prices of clothes in the menswear section are generally higher than what you might get on the street, while the stuff in the other section is not dissimilar to what you can find in other stores around Seoul. Additionally, it was smaller than I expected and therefore it did not take us long to get through the complex. Thus I wouldn't say that this is a must-see location unless you wish for a spot to take cute photos or to see its interesting architecture!", December 2018
29,3.0,"Different, but still a shopping complex.","Imagine a coupla hundred shipping containers stacked to resemble a large number of interlocking shops... two stories of them!Something slightly different, but still a shopping complex of individual shops.How much time one spends here....depends on each individual, and requirements.Eg. How long does window- less shopping takes???From 10/20 mins to ?????? Hours??I was brought here to see ‚Äú CONTAINER SHOPS.....the prices weren‚Äôt to my liking!Didn‚Äôt buy...saving myself for Hong Kong  a week or two, later...", November 2018

31,5.0,Soul of Night,"Yes! Thank god during my trip, i planned to go there to watch the sunset. Really nice!

36,3.0,Cool concept space,"It is quite a cool concept for young crowd‚Äôs hangout space, made entirely from containers, with shops on the first & second floor and restaurants on the top outdoor floor. The exhibition space and music event on the ground level, saw a beer week event with singers and lots of street food joints around the stage area. To be honest, it‚Äôs not too worth it to go if you have not much time because it‚Äôs quite faraway from the center.", May 2018
37,4.0,Hipster Market,"Very different sort of market compared to anything that i have ever gone to in the past. The whole market is made from renovated shipping containers and very open and has plenty of rooftop restaurants and bars, while the rest is made up of international retail brands and a few small independents. We arrived at the end of May when there was a Korean Craft Beer Festival on and it was great and packed to the max. Very cool place with music and art and very easy to get to using the subway. I will say that I was a little disappointed that there weren't more independent shops but maybe that will change in the future with more unique events and festivals at it.", May 2018
38,5.0,Unusual and popular,This is a small shopping and eating area created with old shipping containers stacked two levels high.  It holds several shops and lots of eateries and coffee places.  We especially enjoy The Booth - a local craft beer restaurant that serves great flatbread pizza.  Absolutely recommend for visiting.  It's very loved by the 20s and 30s., February 2018
39,3.0,Generally for photoshot,Stylish shopping mall. There are many people posting outside for a nice facebook/IG shot. Inside is a mall in which the garments are quite expensive. There are cafe and restaurants at the rooftop. It is sufficient to spend within an hour here. Can consider link this place to Garak Market for seafood dinner., April 2018
40,4.0,"Cool architecture, but basically a tiny shopping mall","If you've been to Seoul many times and are in desperate need to find some new spots in town, this is it. It opened in 2015 and is relatively new. There are fashion and lifestyle stores inside, with a couple cafe (try Dore Dore's rainbow cake for instagram fans) and restaurants. The food trucks are also popular. We were there during the sale season and I won't say the clothes here are any more expensive than Aland and the like. But the place is really small and whether it's worth making a trip there is up for discussion... There aren't anything interesting nearby.", January 2018
41,2.0,Normal and expensive,"The container building is unique, however the price for the stuff is expensive compare to other places. Not really recommend for this place.", January 2018
42,1.0,Overpriced and quiet,"Other than the architecture being of  container concept, there is not much to do there. Highly overpriced and expensive international brands.", December 2017
43,4.0,Cool space worth a visit - limited shopping and food though,"We enjoyed exploring Common Ground just before noon. It opens at 11am. It's certainly a cool space and a cool collection for stores. Perhaps too cool if you're not into the mis of Korean/American skateboarder/DJ type. Collection of shops is esoteric and a bit different from the mainstream, but other than Snow Peak (= Japanese lifestyle / camping brand with unique high quality products) most other shops are somewhat repetitive (fashionable baseball caps, jeans, Dr Martens shoes, sneakers, a bit of jewelry, etc. etc.). Food offerings on the third floor were mostly disappointing. We were quite hungry and looking for options, but opted not to stay for lunch. Felt most of the food (especially the Korean/Chinese, Thai, Analog, Curry) all looked less than appetizing.", December 2017
44,3.0,Common Ground is a new concept shopping enclave but pricey,"The Common Ground Park at Konkuk University in Seoul is a noveau approach to shopping but it turned out to be quite a let down as the range of clothes and accessories can be found in Myeongdong n Busan but at a slightly higher price. However, it is here that you can take nice and unique photos. If you love cute toys and accessories for phones as well as diaries, this place might just be up your alley. In fact, i find the vicinity near it more interesting to explore where food is concern. Lots of restaurants serving local fare line the back alleys.", December 2017
45,3.0,Nice concept but pricy stuff,"Love the concept, with many little quaint stores selling unique stuff by young entrepreneurs and designers,  However, the prices are not so friendly to the pocket. Few eateries on the 3rd floor, fried chicken & beer, healthy rice and noodle bento, etc. Nice place to chill after browsing the stores.", December 2017
46,5.0,Worth a visit for those who love shopping.,"Nice shops (especially for guys), nice restaurants and caf√©s to chill at. If you're in Seoul for shopping it's definitely worth a visit even if it's a bit far off from downtown.", October 2017
47,4.0,"Very ""Instagrammable""","This place is suited for the young and hip since there's nothing much you can do here but appreciate the huge blue shipping containers and take pictures. The shops inside are quite expensive. If you feel like having a light snack, you can also head down to the food trucks on the market ground.Oh, did I mention a DJ inside the Market Hall?", April 2017
48,4.0,Good Design for Photos,"Interesting Cargo Design makes interesting photo shooting place, with some trendy young fashion shops here.also the ice cream and coffee shop on 3rd floor both are really nic3", September 2017
49,5.0,Hip and Innovative,"This place is very hip, and majority of the people that I saw were the younger crowds. It's basically a bunch of containers put together to make a mall. Very interesting concept to say the least. It's the first I've seen and was excited to see it, and definitely met my expectations. You have your usual stores on the inside from clothes to accessories and trinkets. Outside of the containers, there's a few food trucks with a nice patio on the ground floor. On the way top, they have an outside walkway with even more food options.  Definitely a place to see for the younger generation.", August 2017
50,3.0,Waste of time,"his place is is made by many blue cargo boxes,It   a container concept shopping mall .This place is small with no Elivator. The food and cafes ok .But,I did not like Shopping products, I came to this place because my wife told me she read about this place from famous blogger in Kuwait.

52,4.0,Great for a lunchtime visit,"We spent five nights in Seoul and once we got the hang of the train system, I was glad our family of four stopped by the Common Ground container park for lunch. We didn't really explore the neighborhood but didn't sense we were missing much, so it was a hop on and hop off to go to the next place experience.We enjoy container parks overall, for the funky idea and different types of shops and eateries and this was no exception. There were some interesting food trucks permanently parked on the bottom level but one daughter expressed interest in a restaurant on the second level so that's where we went. We spent about an hour wandering the shops and taking pictures but didn't buy anything other than food. There was an awesome dj downstairs dancing and playing American music, mixing from different decades. We stayed longer just to hear what tunes he'd play and left after he took a break.", August 2017
53,4.0,Worth for 1-2 hour stay,"Not many shops inside common ground itself or nearby walking streets. We tried spicy dishes in that western restaurant were very special and in good quality. But, it's still a suggested photo area while good weather.", April 2017
54,4.0,"A special container outlook built venue mixed with shops, restaurants and cafes",Great attractions! Container built outlook with many shops of fashion and accessories for both men and ladies. There are also having different style restaurants and cafes for relaxing while you want to take a break during shopping. We missed this place last year and specially visited it this time. It's a nice place!, August 2017
55,3.0,Trendy place for a short visit,An interesting concept shopping place. There's cafes at the top floors and the other floors are retail shops. It's small so don't expect to do much shopping here. Most of the retail shops are aimed for youngsters and are more on the pricey side.Recommend to come here just for a short visit and photo taking., November 2016

There are a lot of cafes too, so it is worth the visit.Please check on my vlog for more information (EN CHANNEL): search by title#7 TRAVEL BLOG DAY 6 SEOUL - DIOR CAFE - COMMON GROUND", June 2017
58,4.0,"Trendy, weird and odd",Some of this place looks like an unkempt backyard and some of it is very stylish and trendy.  Lots of the food places were just opening so the staff could not be bothered with us.  The best place to grab a coffee and cake is the colourful Dore-Dore.  This is a good place to take pictures of the very odd surroundings. Worth the visit!  Look out for the astronaut!, June 2017

61,3.0,Small but good short visit,"Not a huge place but accessible via the metro. The cafes and food are on the 3rd floor so don't miss that. Some unique shops but prices are higher than normal, so only buy the more unique stuffs and NEVER the common brands.", May 2017

Common Ground is near Kunkuk University so it's totally catered for the young hipster crowd. It's basically a pop-up store made up of blue shipping containers and it's 3 stories high with shops. They have unique stores with accessories, stationaries, clothing, shoes, bags and restaurants. They have food trucks too so you can eat outside when the weather is nice. I was surprised to see a small art gallery so you can also check out some artworks. Visiting the Common Ground was perfect on a chilly day with friends. We didn't get to eat there but I did see many different cuisines. I'm not sure if I would go again unless my friends or family really want to go. Merchandise were a bit pricey so we didn't get to buy a lot but I did purchase a few cards that were unique.", April 2016

75,3.0,Hip-ish ,"Common Ground is a somewhat a fashion market place for the youth. It has clothing boutique, food trucks, cafe's & restaurants on the top flood and a hell of a good scenery. The place is most definitely Instagram worthy. There were plenty fashion bloggers who came by to take their OOTD all over the place. If you like clothing (especially interested to see the local brand), then go. If you don't, then you can hang out at the roof top or by the food truck on the outdoor seating. It's a good ""pit-stop"" and an easy walk from Konkun Uni. Station (exit 6 and just go straight.)", December 2016
76,5.0,Nice place,"Once you are here, you will me mesmerized by the blue container structure of the place.

80,3.0,Young gen hangout only - there are other cultural things to see in Seoul,"It was really catered to the university crowd generation - food wise, clothing wise, and general feel.  College kids are just there to take pictures with their significant others. A selfie world.  Cute trinkets, but nothing much to buy unless you want that up & coming label.  We did have the famous rainbow cake at Dore Dore (which has exploded over all of Seoul with multiple locations).  The cakes look amazing.. the taste not so much.  Basically it was layers of dry cake with the taste of food colouring wrapped in cream cheese.  I was expecting so much more; maybe bec' I'm a baker (hobby)/cake lover.  H/E, even my Korean friend was disappointed.  I guess it's the whole ""Korea follow a trend thing"" - the reason for the popularity of this caf√© shop.  Visit Common Grounds if this is not your first time in Seoul, or want to avoid the Chinese tourist crowds.  Otherwise, do something else in Insadong/Palace region/Bukcheon/Seoul Tower, if you are short of time.  You'll spend your time more wisely.", October 2016
