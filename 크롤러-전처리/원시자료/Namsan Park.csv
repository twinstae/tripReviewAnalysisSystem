0,4.0,Nice view of the city,It helped that we went here on the first day so you can get to see Seoul and get your bearings. It is a huge city so it helps to see where everything from a bird's eye view. We were lucky that there was a cultural show as well at the bottom so that was enjoyable for the whole, January 2020
1,4.0,Long climb but worth it,During October - Autumn I climbed to the top. Lot of stairs but great views during the way up. Do bring some water. The view on the top is almost 360 and you get a much better impression of the city. Took the cable cart down and walked through another park which has a part of the Seoul City Wall., October 2019
2,4.0,Great views for miles,"I took the cable-car up & down the mountain (only a few minutes each way) and also went up the tower to the observation deck. You get great views from the tower or the platforms. It's about 10000 WON for the return cable car trip, and the same for the elevator up & down the tower.The views were great, with about a 10-15km clear view.", January 2020
3,5.0,Worth the climb!,"Namsan Park boasts an incredibly romantic view of the sunset! The Seoul cityscape view from the decks, whether it's during daytime or nighttime, is quite breathtaking. From the top there are a few shops that sell love locks where you can write your lover's and your name, find a nice spot to place it, and throw away the key. It's really popular with the youngsters who seem to frequent the area, but I've spotted some older couples as well. From the bottom of the tower you can find N Burger and a small cafe that sells some really great matcha lattes! It can get extremely cold during the winter because of the high altitude, so be sure to purchase some extra heat packs and bundle up with scarves!", December 2019
4,5.0,"Hike up 1.5 km to get the best view , there is also a cable car option . Lovely mountain with local folks hangout .","If your cannot trek , take cable car . You get to see beautiful sunset in the evening . After completing it , too if the mountain is the N Seoul Tower And  love locks .", December 2019
5,4.0,Great view of the city,Took bus #6011 from Namdaemun Market bus stop. It is the last stop.Love the view of the city. Recommend to go up around 5pm to catch the sunset and stay on till night for night view.Bought churros but pricey as it is tourist place anyway.It is very cold as night falls so make sure you wear winter clothes when visiting during winter., December 2019
6,5.0,Beautiful Place in autumn! Hike up then take the cable car down at night!,"I visited in early November 2018. It was still autumn, and the hike up the park was gorgeous. Be sure to bring some water and if you like, some little snack. But do not litter the park! There is also a tiny cafe on the way up, near some carpark area. If you want to try, their waffle if nice! Take lots of pictures! The autumn leaves all around the park is very beautiful and the cooling weather will be great to hike up without sweating. Walk through part of Myeong-dong to get the to the entrance of Namsan park.", January 2019
7,5.0,A haven in the fall!,"I walked from the cathedral uphill to Namsan Park and negotiated the ridge walk and N. Seoul Tower walk. Although steep with many stairs in places, the pace was perfect for absorbing nature. The birdlife and flora was a real pleasure to experience. The vistas from various hills were breathtaking. It was hot work walking, but chilly when at a standstill. Take a jacket and hat! The tower amenities were pure tat. Typical tourist attractions and gifts were jammed into a small area near the tower. The restaurant options were adequate, but the prices high. The views were amazing and the exercise value priceless. Lunch in the tower was about $30 pp, but other level eateries were less by descent. The pigeons fly around in large numbers and are quite fearless around humans, which provides a relaxing distraction. The cable car, buses and taxis are available for a fee, but walking is free and quick. The views on the descent are even better than the ascent!", November 2019
8,4.0,Spectacular views of the city,A huge “park” but really it’s the whole mountain!  There’s paved sidewalks for pedestrians who wish to walk up/down as well as well travelled trails for those who want more of a hike on either sloped or flat terrain. Facilities are available at the peak upon your arrival by foot or motor vehicle (ie tour buses as well as city buses). Cable car is another option. Lots of cyclists also enjoy this park. Go for it!, November 2019
9,3.0,Only reviewing the park,"So I will exclude the tower which I reviewed separately.  As a park, it was a nice walk up the beautifully paved road to the top with the fall foliage in full force.  There wasn't a lot of green and not a lot in the way of single track trails.  It's mostly road or paved path walking although we did go off pavement and followed a storm channel for a bit.  Obviously, it is quite hilly so those who are not physically fit may want to ride the cable car up and possibly walk down... the well maintained flag stone super wide path with steps is a safe and popular option which takes you down beside the cable car as opposed to the road which goes down another side.  Not a stunning park but pleasant.  3 stars.", November 2019
10,5.0,Relaxing green oasis with stunning city views,Park surrounding Seoul tower offering stunning views of Seoul. The walking paths are well maintained. You can take the cable car to the tower but I would recommend walking. The cable car is closed every Monday until 1 PM for routine maintenance., November 2019
11,5.0,Breath taking view!,Include in your itinerary a visit to the view deck of Namsan Mountain. Tip: ride the cable car to and fro or simply walk when you go back. The mountain isn’t that high and steep anyway. More like a hill. You will love the panoramic view of the skyline and sunset. Restaurant price is on the higher side here though., September 2019
12,5.0,Beautiful view and vibe ,"Go up there when the weather is nice for a stunning view. Be ready to queue for the cable car, 40 min for us and it can be up to 90 min!Everyday there is a traditional show not to be missedFood court, few souvenirs shops and many many Love lockers...", November 2019
13,5.0,Good to See,Good place to relax and enjoy the nature. I did some jogging and trail run in the park. Seoul city can be viewed 360 degree from here., November 2019
14,4.0,You can climb a mountain easily from Myondong!,"I stayed at Myondong, near from Namsan Park. I climbed Namsan for a walk feeling after breakfast.Altitude of Namsan is 243m, but was very tired.The atmosphere on the mountain is nice and the scenery of Seoul city was very good.There is the cable car, but I recommend mountain climbing to a tough-footed person.繁華街明洞に宿泊していたので、朝食後、散歩気分でで登山しました。標高は243mですが、意外にきつかったです。山の上の雰囲気はいい感じで爽快なソウル市内の景色は最高でした。ケーブルカーもありますが、健脚な方には登山をお勧めします。", December 2018
15,5.0,Heaps of walking tracks ,I had a really nice afternoon walking apt he all the paths to the N tower! It reminded me of Central Park, November 2019
16,3.0,"Good, nice place to relax","It's a nice place to go see and relax. You can see beautiful nature and Seoul. I came here to just relax and it was nice. Nice for a rest, if you are tired of the inner city loudness.", December 2018
17,5.0,Great place for run,"We went there to run, after eating and drinking, we decided to take a lap on Namsan Park, and I love it. We manage to get around 10 km of running with hilly countour. The track itself is road and somesort of rubber in certain area. They have public restroom in the areas around the park and it's very clean. All in all it's a great place to work up some sweat after eating and drinking the night before.", November 2019
18,5.0,if you want to see the view,Nice place to see the whole of Seoul! The cable car ride is nice but the tower view is amazing! Might seem odd but do go to the toilet when you are up in the tower - doing your business with a view sounds weird but its a new experience!!, October 2019
19,5.0,The view is spectacular ,The view puts this megacity into perspective.  The landscape from Namsan Park are phenomenal.  Lots of gorgeous photo opportunities.  Don’t forget to purchase a love lock and marker to display it with all the others. Definitely a must visit place in Seoul., October 2019
20,4.0,Great run to blow out the boozy cobwebs,"Short trip to Seoul which left me little time to get out and see what the city and capital of the country had to offer - outside of the bars and restaurants. Had a few hours to spare on the last day before the flight home and decided to make the most of a run to the Namsam Tower through the park. Nice gardens, lots of walkers, cyclists and the odd runner forcing themselves up those steep hills to witness the fantastic views at the top.", May 2019
21,5.0,Chance to put city in perspective,Well maintained paths/stairs/roads up the city mountain in Jongno/City Hall area.  Can make the hike up more vigorous by taking the stairs.  Nice overlooks of the city.  Seems to be well used but didn’t feel too crowded.  Seemed to be a bus option up to the top for those who just want to see a 360 degree view of Seoul’s sprawl., September 2019
22,5.0,Grand view of Seoul,"My wife and I went there in the afternoon, trying to get there before the sunset. We under estimated the time it took to go up on the tram, however.  Each tram can take about 30 people or so, and each trip is around 10 minutes.  So by the time we reached the mountaintop, the sun had already set.That said, it was a still and an excellent time to view the glory of the city in the fainting sunlight... and within about 40 minutes, it went fairly dark. The city may be even more impressive in the darkness.There's quite of bit of action at the peat of Namsan Park - Seoul Tower, not sure exactly how to call it but an entire area full of locks symbolizing love, multiple eateries and even a small mall, and artists making sketches. It's a worthy visit.", September 2019
23,4.0,The perfect city views ,This is a very large park. On weekends can be very busy with lines of over 1 hour to get upstairs using the cable car., September 2019
24,4.0,"Pretty park, with nice views of the city, but to get there it's a steep walk!","Our hotel was directly across the street from Namsan Park; instead of doing the treadmill or elliptical at the hotel gym, we decided to walk to the top of the park for our morning exercise.  At 6:30 a.m., it wasn't crowded, but there were plenty of locals out walking as well. The park isn't just at the base of the hill - there are steps and a path waaaaaayyyyy up to the top.  Even if you're in good shape, it's a more than decent workout, taking about 1/2 hour or so depending on your level of fitness.  If you're out of shape, you may want to skip the walk and opt to get to the top on the tram. On the walk, there are plenty of nice spots to stop and take a picture of the city below and in the distance.  Near the top, there's a restaurant, a bridge covered in ""love"" locks, a gazebo where locals were practicing tai-chi, and of course, N Tower.  It was too early to go into the tower, but it was imposing, and, later, seeing it from our hotel, gave us a sense of accomplishment, lol!I love visiting cities, but I also really love finding a nice quiet park in the middle of them so I can stay relax and stay sane.  Namsan Park is a lovely spot of peacefulness in the hustle and bustle of Seoul and I would go back in a heartbeat.", August 2019
25,2.0,Not worth the effort of getting here!,"At the time of our visit it resembled a building site with much of the area fenced off for renovation. Billed as a Hanok  Village : village it's certainly not, but just a collection of 5  Hanok style houses assembled from elsewhere!  They are all rather similar and  quite dreary!", August 2019
26,5.0,Next to the tower,"The park is connected to namsan tower. You can take the cable car to reach the park or you can take the long stairs way, about 1 km of stairs. The park is small but it has a nice view of seoul and you can also see the old seoul wall all along the park surroundings.", September 2019
27,2.0,"Good views, lots of people","A very crowded tourist attraction with good views over the city. We were taken up to the top by coach so did not experience the cable car.There are cultural demonstrations (dancing, drumming and martial arts) at 16:00, which were worth watching (no charge).Otherwise there was not much of interest here and it was difficult to get away from the crowds. The people who had walked up looked very hot and bothered, so this may not be a good summer activity.Eating places were low quality fast food.", August 2019
28,5.0,Namsan for 360 degree views of Seoul,"I've visited Namsan Park on 5 of my recent visits to Seoul.  Having spent 7 years in Seoul as a youngster from 1960 to 1967, I had the opportunity to visit Namsan, before the evolution of Seoul into the modern metropolis that it is today.  My first visit in 1961 already offered great views of Seoul as it emerged from the Korean War of nary 8 years before.  Seoul Tower was not yet constructed, and many of the beautiful trees now gracing the area did not yet exist.  The Korean pagoda was already there, and is still there to this day.  During my recent visits, my favorite route was by foot from the Myeongdong/Jongno district.  There is also a cable car option, but I am reserving that for the day that I am unable to do the uphill trek.  The lavish 360 degree views of modern Seoul are breathtaking, even from the park area itself.  Feeling a bit more adventurous?  Opt to take the elevator to the top of Seoul Tower for a truly mind-blowing view.  On a clear day, you can see well South of the Han River to the high-end Gangnam area, the new business center of Metropolitan Seoul, and to the North, the sheltering mountain ranges surrounding Seoul.   Having lived in the Itaewon area back in the 60s, I've also walked up to Namsan Park through both what were called ""Old"" and ""New"" Itaewon which are accessible from the Itaewon Station of one of the Seoul Metro Subways.  It's a longer climb but less steep, and pleasant.I would consider it a must-see for any first time traveller to Seoul.", April 2019
29,3.0,Namsan Park - Great Views of Seoul,Nice for a picnic.  On weekends there is folk dancing and much to do - up on top of the mountain look out.  It can be crowded on weekends - especially at noon and thereafter., August 2019
30,4.0,Peaceful get-away downtown,The park is a great place to walk or run. There is biking on the road leading up to the tower but not in the main park area., August 2019
31,5.0,Good views,"Namsan Park is located around Namsan Hill, which overlooks Seoul and gives very good views of the city. The walk up is straightforward and not too steep, with most of the walk in the trees in shade. Along theay are a variety of viewing spots. At the top is North Seoul Tower, which can be visited, but the views are good enough without paying to go up the tower. A good half day outing.", July 2019
32,4.0,Way to N Seoul Tower,"Namsan park has got the ropeway that will lead you to the N Seoul Tower. While on the Ropeway, you can see a bird eye view of Seoul. The both way ropeway journey cost around 9000 KRW.", July 2019
33,5.0,You can see all of Seoul from Namsan Park,"Namsan Park sits on the highest point in Seoul. The is a tower which is a landmark which can be seen from many locations when approaching Seoul by car of bus.  The tower some call the Namsan Tower, some call the Seoul Tower allows people to take the elevator to the top and get a spectacular view of Seoul, day or night. There are numerous hiking trails if you prefer to walk to the top but also accessible by a cable car and you can drive or ride a bike as well.", December 2018
34,5.0,Great walk!,"I got by myself, on foot, to the top platform. There are many interesting views along the way. It is better to start one hour before sunset to make both day and night photos. On the upper platform there are many cafes, gift shops, a cosmetics store.", July 2019
35,5.0,friendly place to visit,"accessible by bus or by  cacle car so its friendly to visit even for children, elderly and disabled visitors.", April 2019
36,3.0,Good to burn calories ,"Wasn’t overly impressed with the Namsan Park plus it was brutally hot and humid this day. The views are like any other city highest point views. You may say “oooh’s” and “aaahhh’s” take 4 pictures - one from North, South, East and West than go back down to the streets and go discover some unexplored back alleyways this is what Seoul is about.", July 2019
37,4.0,Largest park in Seoul,"It is the largest park in Seoul and is well-known for its beautiful walking trails. Most visitors come to Namsan Park to enjoy the views, the nature or go for a hike. The iconic landmark in this park is the Namsan Seoul Tower. There are 3 options to reach the top - hike all the way, take public bus or cable car. On top, one can have a panoramic view of downtown Seoul.", June 2019
38,5.0,Gorgeous city park full of monuments and beautiful views!,"Absolutely gorgeous urban park, a hidden treasure in Seoul.  I started my walk on the Millennium Hilton side.  Such gorgeous vistas in every direction - nature + modern architecture + statues to Korean heroes.  So beautiful!", July 2019
39,4.0,A must visit site,"N-Seoul Tower is a must visit site if you are visiting Seoul. The tower is open till 10.0 or 11.0 pm for entry. You will witness some breath taking views from the observatory deck, Access to the uphill transfer till the tower is comfortable.", June 2019
40,5.0,Lovely,"I visiten Namsan Park lot of times and everytime I love this place more and more. Mazing view, tons of green space, lovely people and close to center. I will be back there for sure.", October 2018
41,5.0,"A good mix of nature, history and commerce","The walk up the mountain is not very difficult, and can be completed in about 30 minutes if you walk at a good pace and choose the right path. We went up in a path along the Seoul city wall, starting near Namdaemun Market. A refreshing breeze followed us to the top on that day. We passed by statues of Korean leaders, an office building (with vending machines outside), an exercise area (with bathrooms nearby), a photo island (for photos of the city and geo-reference), and a covered rest pavillion, before getting to the Cable car entrance near the top of the mountain (with vending machines outside). Most of the walk is on paved terrain and there are lots of stairs. But the view from the top is amazing, and there are a lot of fun activities and food that can be tried once you get there. If you want to climb it early, keep in mind that the stores (or the tower) are not open until 9 AM or later. Aside from the restocking trucks and maintenance personnel however, the early hours afford more space and time to enjoy the mountain to yourself.", June 2019
42,3.0,Namsan Park,"Went around Namsan Park. Nice, but average park, as compared to other public parks -- Hyde Park of London, Jardin des Tuileries of Paris, Botanical Gardens of Sydney and Canberra, Shinjuku Gyoen Garden of Tokyo.", June 2019
43,4.0,It’s busy on Sundays,"The park is packed on Sunday. Children were playing traditional Korean games (free). Families enjoy the day out. Couples leave lock testament of their love. There’s enough restaurants up there, with a good variety for children, to keep people happy. You can feed pigeons and enjoy the scenery.", June 2019
44,4.0,Cable car,The park surrounds the Seoul Tower. We got a cable car up to the top but apparently the walk is nice and quite easy (to me it looked steep though). A lot of us were crammed into the cable car but it was a good experience. At the top there’s a few cafes and absolutely millions of locks of love - incredible., June 2019
45,3.0,Good view,Visited this place in the evening.  The view of the city below is very breath taking.If you are a fan of Korean Drama this is the place where the leave their love padlock to express their love with their partner.There is a small souvenir shop and also a 7-11 at the foot of the tower it self., November 2018
46,4.0,good view,"I visited at night and can confirm that the view of the city looks great. there is a place at the top to buy food and drink, nice way to pass a few hours.", March 2019
47,4.0,Love Locks and Views of Seoul,"We were a bit tired so we just walked up to the tram and bought round trip tickets to the peak and back.  Cost was around W9000 each but it saved our feet from climbing up the steep hill after already logging 20k steps that day according to our pedometers!After getting off at the top, the girls first plan of action was to acquire a lock and place it next to  the one placed in March during the other daughters trip.  After a bit of hunting we found the original location but her heart had been removed!  It was quite disappointing since we looked all around the area to figure where it could have gone.  The girls finally settled on a new location for theirs and hopefully it was off to the side and won’t be disturbed to be found in a future visit.We walked to the tower and found a lot more love locks forming trees, locked on hand railings and benches.  Pretty much any conceivable spot that would accept a lock.We opted not to go up the tower as the day was smoggy which would have limited our views.  We did find the views from the base were good at various vantage points.  A deck with glass walls extended partially out from the base of the tower which had seats to enjoy the views.  We also saw the path leading up to the tower and agreed we made the right decision that day.  Maybe next time we will try the climb and experience the natural portion of the park.The ride back down was less crowded so we were able to get front row views.", June 2019
48,3.0,Night view is good,Went there by the cable car. The cable car is small and stuffy. Walking is better if you have the strength as the walk is steep and uphill. It's a one time visit since it overlooks the whole city. The night view is better in comparison to the day view as Seoul can be cloudy at times., May 2019
49,4.0,Nice view from the park,"We went up by cable car and enjoyed the view on the city from the park. We didn't go up the tower, as it was hazy (as always).", May 2019
50,5.0,Fabulous views from the peak and plenty of walking trails to get away from the crowds,"I was fortunate to visit Namsan Park on a gloriously clear day. The views of Seoul from the peak are fabulous, but if the weather was bad I doubt you'd see much. Took the Metro and then caught a bus up the mountain - otherwise it would be a very long walk to the top. Alternatively, you could take the cable car, but I was on a budget. At the peak there is the usual collection of over-priced eating places, so either take your own food, or eat when you get back down the mountain. On a hot day you'll need plenty of water if you plan walking the many trails that criss-cross the mountain. Great place to visit to see the native vegetation and experience the calming environment on the walking trails, where you won't encounter too many other people.", May 2019
51,4.0,Beautiful View of Seoul,"I visited this on a bus tour and was intrigued by the panoramic views it provided of the city. Unfortunately, there is quite a smog issue with Seoul and it really diminishes from the appeal. In fact most of the time outside in Seoul I wore an N99 filter mask.It is still an attraction worth a visit. It might be a bit of an arduous trek uphill for some but the main area and Seoul Tower entrance is relatively close to the bus stop. The area around it is free to access and there are several restrooms. I never ascended the tower as I was happy with the views I got from the courtyard.There is a fence where lovebirds can attach locks securing their relationship. Worthwhile visit for a great view of the city.", May 2019
52,5.0,Namsan Tower (Seoul),"Nice view of the city which is surrounded by the sea, hilly mountains.Weather was great in coldness i presume below 10c, flower was bloomimgsGood to spend time here with loved ones with the great scenery and cold weather", April 2019
53,4.0,Great views,"Went up by cable car at night. It was a bit crowded at the top but the atmosphere (lights, etc.) and views over the different parts of the city were amazing. Some bars and restaurants underneath the Seoul tower offered good views over the city as well. Lots of ""love locks"" all over the place!", April 2019
54,5.0,What a wonderful piece of Escape right in the middle of Seoul,"Hiked up from Itaewon, past the Grand Hyatt and into the park that covers the mountain. The views of the city are there, but much more to the point are the trails - paved, dirt or just tracks in the woods. Lots of flowers on the main paths. Places to stretch or rest or do other exercises. It is highly recommended and you feel much better for having walked there.", May 2019
55,5.0,Super Park - Excellent views and overall experience,This park is large and will easily allow for half a day exploring (including up to Seoul Tower). Impressive views of the city. Very clean with well laid out trails. Recommended to visit on your first day!, May 2019
56,4.0,"Excellent day trip, no need to take cable car","We caught bus #2 (or 5) from Namsan Public Library to mountain top. Then either walk down or catch bus #2 or 5 (only 1 stop). There was lots of food outlets, can enjoy view and have lunch/dinner in food court.", April 2019
57,5.0,Beautiful,"Lovely place, goods vibes, friendly people, i will come back in the next time, high recommended!!! Love it so much", March 2019
58,4.0,Great views of Seoul.,To appreciate this place take the cable car and then pay the extra fee to go the top of the tower to really take in the views of Seoul., May 2018
59,5.0,Great for Families and Friends,"Getting to the cable car was a fun experience. We could either choose to climb up these extremely steep steps or get on a small elevator run by a gentlemen. Of course we chose the elevator and rode up shoulder by shoulder up to the cable cars. Even so, it was such a fun experience. There is a convenience store where you can purchase food, drinks, and locks before getting on the cable car, and at the top are plenty more shops, convenience stores and experiences.", December 2018
60,5.0,Great for family,"This is not actually part of our itenerary but i’m glad we did this. Fortunately since it’s just 5min walk from our hotel and we come early and we avoided the busy atmosphere.. It was peaceful and quiet until after 30 min when the buses from other tours arrived. You have to come early if you want to feel the place. Going back to the cable car, we wear the traditional korean costume for free in front of the mini stone tower monuments (between 11am to 12noon) and take photo with the guards. This is highly recommended for family tour.", April 2019
61,4.0,Cherry Blossom,We were fortunate to be still able to view magnificent cherry blossom at Namsan. The sakura trees lined the road and over the vast areas of the hill; enchanting!, April 2019
62,3.0,"Nice walk, great view, if less mobile take the cable car","A great walk to take in the views back over Seoul.The walk up is a nice one of you're of good or even average fitness, if you're not up to that, or low on time, consider the cable car which was cheap at around $10 AUD (March 2019).Once you're at the top there's a few places to eat and drink and prices are pretty typical of any touristy place in Seoul. If you're a corny couple you can buy a padlock, write on it and lock your love - just like every other couple who visits. It's a nice thought, but do so knowing they get cut down from time to time and for maintenance.", March 2019
63,5.0,Nice place,Namsan Park is where the Seoul Tower is located. The experience started with the cable car ride. The added perks were the offering of free wearing of the Korean National costume and the photo opportunities. Also on this park is the Hello Kitty Island where you can find the Hello Kitty Museum and house. Love locks can be found on an area and also the magnificent view of Seoul from above. There are also shops and restaurants in the area plus the first LED tunnel . Over all this place is recommended, April 2019
64,4.0,Great day out,Negatives: the queue to get into the cable car. And they cram too many people into the cable car.  We went to Namsan Park on a Sunday and were lucky to get a sword demonstration/ and other acts. It was a clear day and the views were good., March 2019
65,5.0,Great view of Seoul,"This is a great place to ride up to the tower to get a wonderful view of Seoul. It is amazing how big the metropolitan are is, pay the entry fee ride up and see for yourself, its WORTH IT!", April 2019
66,4.0,Fall Colors,Actually in my trip I wanted to watch fall colors..to reach and go to Namsan park from Seoul station is very easy.. two km from station..in the center of city Namsan park really give forest sensation.. when we were walking the sensation of the fall colors it was so exiting.., October 2018
67,3.0,Nice views,"This place has besutiful views of the city of Seoul. I went there bu cable car, which costs about 8,000 Won for a ride of less than 5 minutes. It’s better to go there by public bus or the hop-on hop-off shuttle bus from the Koreana Hotel. I was shocked to see the many thousands of “love padlocks” almost completely covering the walkway railing, and completely covering some tree-like structures built just for people to attach their padlocks. Other cities like Paris are cracking down on this thoughtless pracrice", April 2019
68,4.0,Fun,It was nice to see young Korean students there - they seemed to be on a field trip and it  was so cute to see them, January 2019
69,4.0,Views from above over Seoul,Catch the cable car up and see the views from the top of Seoul Tower. You need to pick your day and ensure you will have clear views from the top. We did not encounter long ques for either the cable car of lifts for the tower. We went in the morning so would expect longer ques at dusk when Seoul is lite up. You can reach the tower by feeder buses from a couple of metro stations., March 2019
70,5.0,Great for early morning or late evening strolls.,"If you like to stretch your legs once in a while, you can walk up Namsan and enjoy the park while getting a little exercise in.", March 2019
71,5.0,Definitely Recommend!,"Fantastic views (just...wow) with a good bit to see and do. N Seoul Tower has a bit of history within Seoul and it’s with looking into.

76,3.0,Great view but a tad inconvenient.,"We went at night and the view was amazing. You get a 360 degree view of Seoul. A bit touristy as you can imagine, and steps. Even though the cable car says it is wheelchair accessible, once you get to the top there is nothing but stairs. Having climbed the stairs, and there were still many, I saw that you can catch a bus to the top. However there are still stairs and the wheelchair accessibility is still tricky. They are very friendly and accommodating though so while tricky is possible. Also I was not in a wheelchair, just have arthritic knees.", February 2019
77,5.0,Beautiful!,"Be there by 4:30PM, if you want to see the day view, catch the sunset, and see the night view of the Namsan Seoul Tower.

79,4.0,Picturesque view in December,"I was initially confused when reading the reviews about Namsan Park and N Seoul Tower in Tripadvisor which in fact are at the same place. I almost wanted to skip this tourist attraction but decided to go and there was no regrets. It was snowing earlier and when we reached there, the place looked beautiful.My family decided to try taking the bus as we wanted to save money by not taking a taxi or the cable car. Indeed a good decision!  Since we were staying in Myeongdong, we took the Namsan Circulation bus, a bus that travels on a loop. We almost gave up trying to find the bus stop and asking the locals was futile. I guess only tourists know about this bus. To take this bus, go straight from exit 3 of Myeongdong station. The bus stop will have  a sign  written number 05. The fee is only about KRW1100 by T-money card. We also took the same bus back. We saved so much and it was a pleasant ride to see Seoul city.", December 2018
80,5.0,Namsan Park,"We decided to take the bus up to Namsan Park instead of riding the very, very crowded Gondola. The view is amazing; just make sure to go in early so you can take plenty of pictures - as it gets very crowded.

Seoul Tower and to Namsan Park on a dark, overcast, gray day with snow falling, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT ANYONE visit either attraction when the weather is inclement.So why did I even bother to visit Namsan Park on a bad weather day? Because it was my last opportunity to do so and I really wanted to see both the N. Seoul Tower along with Namsan Park.", February 2019

84,5.0,One of the main highlights in Seoul,I think this is one of those parks that would be pretty no matter what time of year you choose to visit. We came in November and admired the changing colour of leaves in hues of gold and red. Park itself is well maintained and very safe.

90,4.0,360 Degree View of Seoul City,"Built during 1960s, this tower was first used as a broadcasting tower to send out Radio and TV signals and then opened to public. This tower which is around 237 meters tall stand on the Namsan mountain providing a panoramic view of Seoul city from a height of around 480 meters.Considered as the first tower attraction of Korea, visit this place to enjoy the 360 degree view of the seoul city. The entrance fee is a bit on the higher side, but the view from the top well compensates for it. The tower complex has lot of shops and food options and a walk up to the tower and back would be relaxing one in the evening.This tourist attraction is well connected by both metro and city bus services. Or you can opt for Cable Car also. The best time to visit would be in the evening. But if you are using metro or city bus take care not to wait for the last service as getting connecting metro or bus services to your hotel may become difficult.", May 2018
91,4.0,"Namsan Park, Cable Car and Tower!","We took the clear elevator going to the Namsan Cable Car Ticket booth. Then we ride the cable car so we can go up the Namsan Tower. Lots of Kdrama scenes were also shot around this area. So I took every chance I can get to take pictures and pose like the actors/actress. We ate before going up at a nearby café. There are lots of activities you can do in Namsan – Arcade, eat at a restaurant, photo booth, check the Hello Kitty Island Museum, shop, put a lock at the designated areas or just have coffee. At the observation deck of Namsan Tower, you’ll get to see the 360-degree view of Seoul. It was beautiful. There are souvenir items around the tower and some activities you can do. We got to spend a few minutes here and then just enjoyed the view from other areas.", December 2018
92,4.0,Great way to see the light of Seoul. Especially nice for Christmas,"This is a nice ride up the mountain. Try to go for sunset, as the view is wonderful. Entrance is somewhat difficult to find due to the hillside. Best way to get there is to walk uphill from Shinsegae. There is an elevator that takes you to the the gondola landing. Lots of restaurants at the top of the mountain, but they will be busy.", December 2018

98,4.0,Worth a visit,Take the cable car to the top. It’s worth a visit. A little walking is needed so not suitable for wheelchair bound unless you are driving up. Great view of the city. Not too far away from the famous Myeongdong shopping area., December 2018
99,4.0,Nice view but it’s windy on a cold winter day,"You can get to the cable car station using the free shuttle bus located near to Myeongdong Station Exit 3. Alternatively can also choose to walk up passing through some shops up hill. Another way is to take exit 4 Myeongdong Station & walk towards the Shinsegae direction. Upon reaching the cross junction, turn left to Sogong-ro (ascending direction) for about 200m. There’s a free elevator directly to the cable car station.", December 2018
100,5.0,Walking Mt Namson & N Seoul Tower,"There is a path that travels around and up the mountain that sits in the middle of Seoul. It really does sit in the geographical centre of Seoul, they even have a marker at the peak. The park is approximately 300 hectares. We were informed we called walk it, but most people take the cable car up and down. At the top is the N Seoul tower.We didn’t research the route as well as we could have, so we winged it a bit, yet still managed to get most of it in. We walked from our hotel to the base of the cable car. There is a large enclosed escalator / lift that takes you to the cablecar entrance. We followed a bunch of hikers up the road to the park entrance. Instead of taking the stairs that run adjacent to the cable car, we used the ring road initially and followed the maps we came across along the way. About 3/4 of the way around the ring road there was a short cut path to the tower, of course it was stairs, but not too many as it happens. Like everything else we have found in Seoul, the path is wide & extremely well maintained. There are heaps of pleasant stops with seats and picnic areas along the way. Oh and clean and warm facilities at regular intervals too. This made the walk a real pleasure. The view at the top is expansive, you can see 360 degrees. We opted out of going up the tower. We walked the stairs back down next to the cablecar and followed the ring road back around to exit down to Namsangol Hanok Village. In hindsight, I would have liked to have started here, then walked up and around Namson. Perhaps even maybe also explored the botanic gardens on the other side to have made an entire day of exploring the mountain.", December 2018
101,4.0,"Wind is strong, watch out in winter","The park itself is not very big and there's nothing much to DO there if you don't enter the tower (we didn't). It was cold AF in winter (-10C excluding wind chill) but the views were excellent, and oh yes! The Geographical centre of Seoul is right there, in a quiet corner in front of a wooden shed. I'd say, just don't go when temps are below zero.", December 2018
102,5.0,Must Visit In Seoul,"We visited on a very cold Monday.If you want to use Namsan cable car, take subway line 4 to Myeongdong Station (exit 4). Walk straight westwards towards the Hoehyeon intersection (Shinsegae Dept. Store and Woori Bank are on the opp corner). Don't cross the road, turn left - walking southwards in the direction of the Namsan Park/Namsan Tunnel 3 - up the hill. The free Namsan Oreumi is located at the entrance of Namsan Tunnel #3 (near the Hoehyeong 119 Safety Center).  It is like a mini Penang Hill Railway.  They are closed for maintenance for a few hours every Monday.Alternatively, you can walk or take the Namsan bus.  I did not take the bus so I am not familiar with it.It is a must see especially for the view and many many locks.  You can purchase light plastic locks at the Namsan Park.

127,5.0,"Lovely to visit when it's a bright, sunny day.","I really liked visiting this park as I was on my way to the North Seoul Tower. I took the Metro from City Hall to Myeong-dong station and then asked a young man in the ticket booth the best way to the Tower. I took the cable car and was soon enjoying the views from the Park at the top. It was a glorious, sunny autumnal day and the views of the city were wonderful.I took my time up there, not only to admire the panorama but also to enjoy the peace and people watch. The place was quite busy, even though it was a weekday morning. There were quite a few groups of young children having impromptu picnics and older, uniformed adolescents showing off. The park really seemed to be popular with both young and old, local and international people. I was reminded of the Hohenzollernbridge in Cologne when I saw all the love locks in one area near an apparent beer garden which was unfortunately colsed on the day I visited. The place was absolutely covered in love locks - clearly the man in the nearby booth had been doing a roaring trade in selling them.", October 2018

140,4.0,Lovely views over the city,"We could see the Seoul Tower from our hotel and it had been recommended as a place to visit. It was a short walk from our hotel to the elevator leading to the cable car station, and we had to wait about 10 minutes to get on the elevator. Once at the cable car station there was a long queue for tickets and no sign of a cable car, so seeing a path up to the Park just opposite the building, we decided to walk up, as many others did. It’s not a difficult walk if you are reasonably fit and is a mixture of steps and paved path (mostly steps), with plenty of places to rest and enjoy the views on the way up. It took just over half an hour to get to the park. Once there, there are plenty of places to have a drink or something to eat, and viewing terraces so you get a good 360 degree look at the city. We decided not to go up the Tower itself, although there was no queue to visit. To the rear of the Park there is a short slope down to several bus stops where we took a bus back down to the city.", October 2018

143,4.0,Try to visit the whole park and in both day and night,I visited this park 3 times during my August visit. I suggest starting from one end and walking to the tower (it takes 40 minutes from Seoul Station) and then exiting the park via the MUCH less crowded eastern end. The east part is much less crowded and allows you to see another portion of the wall and nice scenery as well. It is much busier to visit here at night (avoid weekends) but something you should do at least once for the good view. There is a bus but I find walking much more rewarding., August 2018

157,4.0,Exploring the heights,"The quickest way to get into Namsan Park with its famous Namsan Tower is by Namsan cable car. The park has Love padlock area just like in Paris, and we can go up to the Seoul Namsan Tower which has great view from the height. If you don't feel to go up, you can explore the area under the tower. The park is also undoubtedly beautiful.", July 2018
158,5.0,Take the stroll up,Enjoy the 30 mins stroll up the to namsan park. You will feel that its all worth it and make the the securing of the lock even more meaningful. Good place to hang out during the night. However the cable trip down can be quite scary because the operators will jam packed the cable. Hope this is not a safely issue., December 2017
159,5.0,Nice view of namsan Park,"A wonderful experience from above Namsan Tower. You can see the beauty of Seoul City. There are 2 ways to get to Namsan Tower: take a bus or if you want to get more experience using the cable car. If you use a cable car, when you get there you will find one spot where there are colorful padlocks which according to the story show the couple who are in love to promise each other. But if you use a cable car, you have to prepare physically because to get to the tower, climb up the stairs which is quite a lot. But all that will pay off when you arrive at the top view of the city of Seoul from above. If you want to go to the tower, you should go at night so you can see the beautiful glitter of the city lights.In the tower there is a dining area, playground, souvenirs, lots of nice and unique photo places. So don't miss your trip if you are in Seoul.", July 2018

166,3.0,Okay park to reach N Seoul Tower,"Namsan Park sits at the bottom of N Seoul Tower and offers quite a view of Seoul and its surrounding. There are several shows here during different timing of the day, where people light up the beacons on the hill to reenact a ritual from the past. Good to check the timings before you come.Aside from that nothing really special, except the place is just a park you pass by on the way to N Seoul Tower.", July 2018

176,5.0,City hiking,"Namsan Park is home of the N.Seoul Tower but there is much more to discover especially on foot.  After a fifteen minute walk from our hotel near Jongno3-ga subway station we arrived at the foothill of the mountain and our first discovery of the morning was the memorial site of 'The Ground of Memory' dedicated to comfort women during WW2, a rather poignant way to start the hike.  From here it is all uphill via staircases, sealed and unsealed pathways and by the road, delightfully peaceful.The park was very pretty with the variety of changing colours of the leaves, different types of birdlife, running water features, undulating terrain and a visit to the Waryongmyo Shrine.  We passed many older Korean people out walking through the park, it was pleasing to see that they are not put off by walking hills.  After a very pleasant walk through the lower part of the park we arrived at the main staircase to climb up to the N Seoul Tower, most visitors will not take this path, rather choosing to take the cable car.  The hike up (1200m) is challenging but just take your time and the views and nature, it took us under thirty minutes with several photo stops.Nearer to the start of the climb up were drinking water fountains and toilet facilities, and roughly halfway up is a viewing platform called Jamdoobong Photo Island(North Point) with nice views over the park and Seoul.  If you are feeling up for a lovely holiday hike without having to travel far then Namsan Park is easily accessible by subway and on foot.", April 2018
177,4.0,Hilly Park with Great Views,"This park is home Mt. Namsan with N Seoul Tower located at the peak.  To reach N Seoul Tower at the peak of Mt. Namsan, you can walk along the hiking trails, take a bus, or take a cable car.  At the peak of the park, there is a free observation deck with a good view of Seoul.  For a better view, you can pay to go to the top of N Seoul Tower.Around the base of N Seoul Tower at the peak of Mt. Namsan, there is an amazing number of love locks.  There is even a vending machine selling love locks.  Other facilities include restaurants, food outlets, game arcade, gift shop, and plenty of photo ops.", May 2018
178,4.0,Long way to get to the top!,"Me and my parents took the gondola ride to get to North Seoul Tower from Namsan Park.  Not plenty of parking spots though. If you're looking for parking, go to the science hall a little further up the hill.  And there was a loong line of people trying to ride the gondola so make sure you wear comfortable shoes and clothing. Worth the wait though!", June 2018
179,4.0,Adventure to the Top,I've been here twice so far. Once by foot following the trail to get to the N Seoul Tower and the second time to try out the cable car ride. Both visits were leisurely and nice. But be sure to wear sneakers if you're going to walk instead of taking the cable car. It is do-able but comfy shoes would be wise., August 2017
180,5.0,"Great view, pay to go up","You pay to go up, but you can save that payment if you end up eating at the restaurant up there. The restaurant averages around $30 to $40 per person so you can do your calculation if it is meanwhile or not. The food is actually good and the view is even better. The best time is to go at night and you can see the lighted up area of Seoul. There are kiosks at the bottom of the park and can enjoy a few beers at the restaurants there.In order to get here, you can either take a taxi, take the local bus 401 or 405 and change to another small one or walk up from the main Namsan street (a good 20 minutes). I have made it to 155 countries. I have an extensive blog at pinchetravels.com, if you want to read more about my travels.", September 2017
181,5.0,"Great view of the city of Seoul, come at night, NOT WEEKENDS!","Excellent place to come to see the skylights of Seoul at night.  When you get on the tram on the way up make sure to go to the back of the tram and look backwards, and the opposite on the way down, to get the best night-view of the entire city.On top you can buy another ticket to go on the elevator to go up a tower with viewing areas to get a 360 view of the city.Beware, the place is packed, and I mean packed, on weekends.  My wife and her family had to wait 1.5 hours for the tram, and 1 hour for the elevator up the tower, and not much less coming down from neither places.  So if you can, avoid going there on weekends, but do enjoy on weekdays.", July 2018
182,4.0,Pretty park nice views,Pretty park in downtown area. Several really nice viewing platforms. Cable car.  Hop on hop off also drives thru, July 2018
183,4.0,Must visit in Seoul,Perhaps the most accessible place in Seoul to get a view of the city. We visited 2 years ago and went back again this time with kdrama Korean Odyssey at the back of our mind lol....Both times we took the cable car up from Myeongdong and walked down. As we were heading down somewhere else this time though the maps in the park weren't very clear so we spent quite alot of time doing a roundabout walk to get to where we needed to be. The views at the base of Namsan tower are good so we have never bothered with the tower. There are many tourists so it's really busy. I was glad we managed to see the rebuilt Joseon era fire beacon signals and there were some people dressed in historic costumes as part of the experience. As it was our wedding anniversary we also did the cheesy love lock thing though we used our own lock as the locks sold in the machines and shops there are way overpriced - would advise couples to come armed with your own!! A must-visit when in Seoul and the park offers good walking routes if you know where you are going!!, July 2018
184,5.0,Nice place,"It will be good to see the N Seoul Tower, near Myeongdong Cathedral. I suggest that you get a two way cable car ticket. The place is romantic. You may use the elevator going down. If you ll go to Myeongdong, walk to the bus stop and its just one ride.", June 2018
185,4.0,a place to see seoul from top,an icon of seoul. worth to go. and a place where you can place your love lock. Never seen a place with so much lock before : ), June 2018
186,4.0,Nature is the best,Local government needs to continue to preserve the nature as much as possible at this hill. Is a great place for recharge in such a stressful city like Seoul. Also need to have more English signboards., June 2018
187,4.0,Tranquility in the heart of chaos,Lovely landscaping. One of the places in Seoul where locals are actually not throwing trash everywhere. Stayed at the Hyatt right next to ine of the entrances. Very convenient. A lot of dogs though..., June 2018

191,5.0,Great view,2nd time to this site lots to do and not very costly so if you are on a budget it wont break the bank. The elevator is super fast and the view from the tower is spectacular try to go on a day were the pollution is low for a better view. Plenty to eat in the area you can walk or take cable car., June 2018
192,4.0,Not an easy hike up to Namsan tower,"My hub and I was at the palace nearby when saw the sign that ahead is the Namsan Park. Initial plan was to take a bus up to Namsan Tower but since we were early, we decided to hike up. Honestly, not an easy hike as there were some steep slopes. We weren’t dressed in sports attire and felt that it would have been more comfortable to dress lighter since it was summer in June. But the hike up and view was nonetheless great. We spent about 45 mins to get up to Namsan Tower from the bottom. Good experience.", June 2018
193,3.0,City views,"If you have been up the peak in hkg or mt faber in singapore, this is exactly the types of views you will get, city views. But in Namsan, you get views of some other mountains as well. Up there, you get clear views of the city buildings landscape. If you are searching for a breathtaking nature view, skip this. I find it a waste of time and money. The place is flocked with tourists and locals. Lots of lovers gg up there to ‘lock their love’ so for a family especially with young kids, i think its ok to skip this attraction. I would suggest going to seoraksan at gangwon do for a spectacular view of nature instead.", June 2018
194,3.0,Enjoy the lookout,Namsan park is best visited in spring for the cherry blossom or autumn for the changing color of the leaves. From different sides you can walk up or down the hill but this might be bit hot in summer. Be prepared to meet lots of tourists but once up the hill you can enjoy the view., March 2018
195,5.0,Nice Park on a Hilltop in Seoul,"The place up there is really nice especially during sunset. However, the queue for the cable car takes more than an hour which is not really worth the time spent waiting. Taking a bus up there is cheaper and save time.There were live music during our weekend visit. Needless to say, the queue up to the tower was another hour long. Restaurants were full as well.So try not to go during weekends before sunset. Everywhere is crowded.While taking a bus down to Myeongdong area, passing through the cable car station after 9 pm, there were still queues of people heading up the hill. Unbelievable!", May 2018
196,5.0,Top most point of Seoul,"The cable car which leads to the n Seoul Tower cannot be missed by those who are visiting Seoul.It's a great view on top gives a panoramic view of the city and worth visiting once.When you are in the tower, do not miss the toilet where the urinals are overlooking the city view below.. its breathtaking and very nice :-)", September 2017

198,3.0,Worth a Visit,"The view of the city would be similar to other countries - Malaysia, Hong Kong, etc. What makes it attractive is the morning walk with a cool weather, that is, if you’d visit during the cold seasons.", March 2018
199,5.0,Morning Walk,this is best place to do morning walk in Seoul and you will see a lot of bird and different type of tree., May 2018
200,5.0,Take the hike to city walls!,Starting out from the botanical garden we hiked up along the city walls to the tower. While it's quite a bit of stairs and somewhat intensive it's a pleasant walk along the ancient remains of Seoul while surrounded by the buzzing metropole. At the top you're rewarded with nice views over the city., May 2018
201,5.0,"Great walk, great views","The highlight of my trip to Seoul was the climb up Mount Namsan and the rewarding views of the city.  We couldn't quite figure out how to access this park from public transport, but it turned out Chungmuro subway station (Orange line 3 ad Blue line 4) was perfect, just to the north of the Namsan Hanok village. After exploring the village a bit, head to the southernmost edge, near the time capsule, to a gate on the SW corner. Turn right toward the main road through Namsan, and there's a pedestrian bridge over it--depositing you on the northern circuit of the mountain park.  Follow the signs (turn left) to get to the entryway to the stairs to the summit.  Not an easy climb, but not grueling, and worth the views on the viewing platform and the summit.", May 2018
202,4.0,Old faithful,"Easy access to a small mountain south of Seoul with a full view of north and south of Seoul.  You can walk up the stairs, a gentle paved slope or take a ride in a cable car; 3 approaches.  Worth the walk.", February 2018

206,4.0,Great view. Take the cable car.,Great views. Family friendly environment with plenty of photo opportunities. Skipped Seoul Tower because the view was good enough. Buy the round trip cable car ticket as it is a good distance to the top. Food available. Good place to hang out., May 2018
207,5.0,Great for a stroll,"The park is nice and quiet, and it is definitely a lovely place to go for a stroll. As the climb can be rather steep, I suggest taking the cable car up to the tower and walking the route down. Especially if you happen to be visiting on a very warm day like we did.I would suggest to get your hands on a map of the park before you visit - the area is big, and there are many routes down that connect to different parts of the city, and as such it can be rather easy to get lost. We also found a lot of signs were misleading when it came to distance (one sign would say 200 metres left, then 100, then suddenly 200 again!). A good map would have saved us, but instead we enjoyed the nature and some achy feet at the end of the day.", May 2018
208,5.0,Great park!,"The park is nice, walk through the path and alot of trees surrounds the area, theres a few rest area too.", May 2018

210,5.0,The view is amazing but earned,"My first few trips to Seoul I walked the distance. This time I took the cable car 😁. Regular cultural shows and displays and by the time you get to the to you willhave earnt your rest. Buy lunch, sit back and enjoy some amazing views. Can get really crowded on the weekends.", May 2018
211,4.0,Pleasant walk to the top,"Instead of cable car or bus, we walked to the top through Namsangol Hanok Village. The stroll and climbing of stairs (equivalent to 80 storeys) took about an hour to reach the Namsan Tower, where lots of tourists are transported by buses.Unfortunately the weather was hazy. The view would have been terrific otherwise.", May 2018
212,5.0,Excellent park for trail running!,I went for a run in the park all the way up to the tower and enjoyed it a lot! There are also many outdoor gyms scattered throughout the park. The history of the old city wall that runs through the park is also very interesting., February 2018
213,4.0,Steep Climb,We walked through the park on the way to the N Seoul Tower. The paths were nice and clean and it was a nice walk through the trees. It was quite steep. We started from the Public Library entrance and it took about 30 minutes to climb up. There were quite a few rest spots and paths that seemed to lead to other areas of the park. Really nice walk up although it was a tad tiring., December 2017
214,5.0,Definitely a must see,"If you've come all the way to see Namsan tower, you may as well take some time to see Namsan park as well. It's peaceful and beautiful. Well worth taking some time out to see.", May 2018

217,4.0,Scenic park with good view,"This is a very scenic park with a good view. There is a free lift to get up to the cable car station and from there you can either walk up the very steep mountain or catch a cable car. We took the cable car up - 6500 each one way and walked down, which was a nice way to do it.At the top it can get a little hazy/foggy, but can still get a great view of Seoul. There's a pagoda at the top, a few viewing platforms and of course Seoul Tower. We decided not to go up Seoul Tower as we thought the view from where we were was good enough.In Seoul plaza there was a demonstration of a 3D tv as well as a tourism area which had promotional tourism videos using virtual reality. That was pretty cool.A cute thing you can do with a loved one is to add a love padlock to the fence or to one of the love padlock trees. There were heaps of them and it was nice to view this monument to love. There was also a sign saying that a reality tv show had been filmed at this location.", March 2018
218,5.0,Worth a visit!,"Since we were travelling with senior citizens, we took the cable car up the mountain. Its a short 5 mins ride uphill. We had reached the cable car station at 1000am and didn't have to wait in the queue.  It was quite cold in early April, but still got clear views of the Seoul city …. could easily spot the few landmarks - our Hotel, Blue House, Parliament building, Shilla hotel, Lotte world tower, bridges over Han river etc. Lots and lots of love locks creating a colourful atmosphere. The K-drama places add to the charm. Its worth visiting for first timers to Seoul. Walking up the hill would offer viewing cherry blossoms in spring time, which we could only enjoy from the cable car. I guess the evening and night time would be even more charming with the lights lit up. it was an enjoyable visit including the souvenir shopping.", April 2018
219,5.0,"If you want to walk to the tower, you may need to walk against the signposts","This is an amazing park, especially during the cherry blossom, totally worth the steep climb. However, notice the signs in the park that say ""N Seoul Tower"" actually point to the base cable station. If you plan on walking up to the tower, you might need to walk in the opposite direction (depending where you are).", April 2018
220,5.0,Romantic and beautiful,"There are several routes to reach Namsan Park. We took the subway to Line 4 Myeongdong Station. We chose Exit 4 and walked straight and keep left when reached a cross junction. There, we continued to walk, following the direction of N Seoul Tower far in front of us. There was a slope which took us about 10 minutes to walk, then we reached a lift to go to cable car centre.  The fee for one-way ticket is KRW6000, and KRW8500 for a return ticket. The waiting line was acceptable in view of that we went on a weekday. We saw many young local couples here. Not hard to guess as the famous love locks can be found here. There are machines selling love locks together with a marker pen. There are several restaurants, and shops for the visitors. It was enjoyable to be at the Namsan Park. The night was lovely and the weather was cool. For those would like to go up to the N Seoul Tower, the entrance fee is KRW10000.", March 2018

222,5.0,Namsan Mountain and Tower is Well Worth a Visit!,"Whether you want to walk, drive, or take the cable care, and whether you want a nice walk, a tourist experience, or an amazing view, Namsan Tower is amazing. The price to visit the top of the tower is a very reasonable $10 (10,000 won) per person. However, there is a stunning view on the mountain itself, which is also filled with many different walks. Spring and summer are both great times to visit Namsan Park, but any season is okay.", April 2018

It well paved but does have a steep incline at time. If you haven't walked up then I would recommend it but the second time I took the lift. You save a lot of time and enjoy the view on the ride up. Many spots along the way to stop and take photos., March 2018
232,4.0,Spectacular views at sunset,"The tower observatory is almost always crowded since it is a popular date spot and tourist destination. Views from the observation deck of Seoul are excellent when you can get to a clear spot by the windows. Time your trip up right and you can catch a beautiful transition, as Seoul wakes up for the night. You take a short tram ride up to the ticket office then take another tram up to the foot of the tower itself. There are multiple areas to buy and lock away your love for couples. Coffee stands dot the area. The best views of the tower itself are right off the top of the stairs by covered sitting area. New light displays change colors of the tower often so you don't get the same views each night.", March 2018

234,5.0,Seoul Tower,We walked up to the N Seoul Tower which is located in this park. It was a lovely walk - very quiet and safe at night., November 2017
235,4.0,Cable car - night view,We went up the cable car and the tower as we are already there for our dinner at the MokMyeongSanBang which is at the foothills of Namsan. It is quite pricey but if you have plenty of time and enjoys tower view of whole of Seoul - this would be what you like. We were there just to kill sometime after dinner and since we are there - locked a 'love lock' just for the sake of it! lol, March 2018
236,4.0,Nice view ,"Namsan Park is a hill, which is located in southern part of downtown Seoul. There is a rope way to the top of hill, where there is a tower. But you can also walk from Myondon or Seoul station. It takes less than one hour. From the hilltop, you can enjoy a panoramic view of Seoul.", January 2018
237,4.0,Invigorating walk,A good 6-8km loop with trails in between and with scenic views of the city. Be warned that it’s very hilly and there are stretches with steep slopes/many flights of steps. We did the equivalent of 72 flights in the 2.5 hour walk.Very invigorating and with a few quaint tea-houses along the way., March 2018
238,4.0,Best Viewed at Night (or late evening staying into night),"If you can avoid crowded times, plan to take the cable car to the park from Meongdong. Then go to the top of Namsan Tower where you will have amazing views of the city (assuming it is a low pollution night).", October 2017
239,5.0,"Great choice, and even better view!!","Namsun or Nam mountain, is a must see in Seoul. There are several options to get up there, taxi, bus or cable car. You can go all the way to the top of the tower to have nice dinner, or just to experience amazing view. Namsun is not something that some of other cities don't have, Belgrade also have Avala mountain and Avala tower, but it is about 20 km from city, so the view is nothing special, just woods. But Numsan is totally different you will be amazed by the view, because it is located almost in center of Seoul. Oh yea, you have to use cable car, it will take you to one amazing street, and most crowded street I have ever seen, it is Myeongdong.", September 2017
240,4.0,Seoul tower,Seoul tower on cloudy day. This place is famous for the lock that promises love. Visitors hang their own locks, March 2018
241,5.0,A Must See Attraction ,Make sure you have a lot of energy cause you will need to do a lot of walking up inclined roads to reach the top of Namsan Park.  But its worth every step!  Great place to take photographs of the city view of Seoul and especially if you take the elevator up to the top of the tower!, February 2018
242,5.0,Super cold t the top during winter,"Better buckle up to the top . The view is breathtaking however can be really cold at the top during the winter . The ride on the cable car takes about 3 mins , but the lines can get to you if your not a very patient person visiting on a holiday but once at the top you’ll enjoy the view along with visiting the restaurants , souvenir store and the many other activities going on.", February 2018
243,5.0,What a view!!!,Beautiful views!!!! Easy access with city buses (search park online and website tells you where buses pick up!). The locks are really cool too., February 2018
244,3.0,N Seoul tower is good for patient people,"Price is high, and the queues are insane, but the view at daytime is very nice. Again, at night time the view gets destroyed by lights reflecting off the windows. The lighting is too strong inside. It is possible to save time and money by just viewing the city from to mountain itself, no need to go inside the tower.", March 2017
245,3.0,Cold in the Winter!,Spent an evening here in the winter. Good views of Seoul but bitterly cold! make sure you wrap up warm before you go!, December 2017
246,5.0,Pretty view,Tbis is a ride that ypu want to do in a clear day. Because Seoul can get foggy some times. So be sure to check the weather., November 2017
247,5.0,Great view of Seoul,"Very good location to get a feel for how expansive Seoul is. When we visited the air pollution was extreme, so could not see much of the city. However, when at street level the pollution was not particularly obvious", January 2018
248,4.0,Get away from the city,"Pleasant walk up to Namsan mountain. Great way to escape the city and enjoy an afternoon, time it right for a great sunset view over Seoul.", February 2018
249,5.0,Namsan,"Very attractive, clean and it has a very good service to the customers. Most of the tourists usually go first to Namsan", April 2017
250,5.0,More than just a park,"This is not just a green space to go walking in. There are cultural buildings, a restaurant, a memorial to the lost women, a museum, gardens, monuments to martyrs and the Seoul Tower. This park is definitely worth a full day. You get in a lot of walking, but there is so much to see and do there. Pack snacks for the day since the food offered is more expensive and not as prevalent as other locations, but it is definitely worth your time. You can end your day riding the cable car and going to the Seoul Tower.", January 2018
251,4.0,Tran ride to top,"The team ride for $8 saves from having to walk to the top (free).  At the top, there are nice views of the city.  The best view will cost another $10 to go up the tower. I would recommend for first timers.", January 2018
252,5.0,Top of the Mountain,"Mt. Namsan is a symbolic mountain located at the center of Seoul. Although not as high as other surrounding mountains, Mt. Namsan is a very popular nonetheless as a resting site. At the top, there are various facilities such as Palgakjeong (octagonal hall), Seoul Tower, Maritime Aquarium, fountains, and Namsan Library. You may take a cable car to the top or walk up the stairway path. Other than this path, there are many other walkways to Namdaemun, Hoehyun-dong, Taegyero 3(sam)-ga, Jangchung Park, Itaewon, Huam-dong and much more. The driving courses here are also popular for couples. Namsan Park is a historical site. You will find Bonghwadae (beacon mound) at the top as it was once the center of capital defense. During the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) the capital was changed to Hanyang,(current Seoul) and to protect the city from invasions, castle walls were built on the 4 major mountains like Mt. Bukaksan, Mt. Inwangsan, Mt. Naksan and Mt. Namsan. On Namsan peak, five beacons were built to report the news from local governments to the central government with a five-signal system. Also on the top of Mt. Namsan, there is the Palgakjeong Pavilion, which has a fantastic view. At Seoul Tower (479.7m), you can view the whole landscape of Seoul and the West Sea beyond Incheon. The rotating restaurant in the Seoul Tower also boasts excellent views. With excellent night view, you should try having dinner at the tower. It would be a great experience to visit Namsangol Traditional Korean Village which is a village of 5 traditional Korean houses.", September 2017
253,5.0,Good park,"Good park & tower in the heart of city. Fresh air, nice nature, good food & others. You can relax after seeing the city on a trip", January 2018
254,5.0,My favorite Park in Seoul.,I always visit this Park when I am in South Korea. Specially enjoyed taking the Cable Car ride to enjoy the breathtaking views of the whole City in Seoul., October 2017
255,4.0,Nature in the city,A worthwile place to seek nature but can be crowded. The hike above towards the tower provides fantastic views over the surroundings of thr city., January 2018
256,5.0,Great view - great „work out“,"The Namsan park is a hilly park leading up to the Namsan tower. It is fun with kids, you can do your workouts there, watch the locals or join in on the fitness equipment. It has small ponds, and is beautifully arranged. It is enjoyable at any season.", February 2017
257,5.0,Nice walk and views,We decided to walk up the mountain instead of taking the cable car. From the ticket office at the bottom you cross the street and find some stairs. It’s about a 30 min walk with lots of stairs but easily done. Lots of places to stop for a rest and take in the city views. From the top of the mountain there are lots of locks that you can buy and attach to the fences. It’s quite pretty! The views of the city are great as well. Worth a visit!, January 2018
258,4.0,Good for sunset sighting ,"We came here at around 4.30pm and it's was a good time and good weather for sunset. We took bus from Myeongdong and arrived at the bus stop at Namsan Park. There's a little slope to go up to the love locks corner. As we were a bit late, the crowds were already formed and all the spots for sunset sighting were taken. However, we still managed to see the sunset. I recommend to just stop here for the landscape sighting instead of buying the ticket to go up to N Seoul Tower, because this view is more beautiful than sighting from the tower itself.", December 2017
259,4.0,great view,We got lost on our way to the tower but good thing is that we were able to explore other area which is also nice and beautiful., April 2017
260,5.0,Came to See the Fresh Snow,"We came on Dec 31 when it had snowed the day before.  Since our hotel was in Myeongdong, the walk to the cable car was about 10 minutes.  The round trip price for the cable care is 8,500 won.  You can buy one way for 6,000 won.  While we were up there, we saw signs for the bus so apparently you can take a bus up although we enjoyed the few minutes up in the cable car.We walked around for about 30 minutes and enjoyed all the fresh snow on the ground.  A lot of people had the same idea.  It was crowded.After the cable car down, we saw the Namsan Ormi Elevator (FREE!) and it saved us some downhill walking.", December 2017
261,5.0,Awesome place to go in Autumn,"Visited Namsan park in Nov, Autumn season. The place is so amazing, littered with trees with different crown colours. Nice scenery as well. Please do go up to the Namsan tower which offers a panoramic view of the city.", November 2017
262,3.0,View of Seoul from Namsan,We took subway line 4 to Myeongdong station and walked to the cable car station. Bought round ticket for cable car and went up to the Namsan park. Korean traditional marshal art performance and photo sessions for tourists with performers. Great view of Seoul., December 2017
263,5.0,Couldn’t be better! The most convenience exercise park in the heart of Seoul,"Beautiful Saturday morning at Namsan Park. -7 degrees but perfect sunny day! About 7.5 kilometer one round.  Small cafe on the way, you can grab a cup of hot drink if you are thirsty or feeling cold.", December 2017
264,5.0,Short ride to top of cable car depot - shops and views,"The cable car runs every 10 minutes, and is a popular ride to get to the N Seoul Tower. Up top, you'll see the thousands of ""locks of love"" placed by couple on all the fences and ""trees."" Fantastic views, even if cold and windy. Arcades, restaurants and a gift shop as well.", December 2017
265,5.0,Beautiful view,"It's nice to take the short cable car ride up and then go up Seoul Tower. The park is excellently manicured with flowers, trees, and other landscaping.", November 2017
266,5.0,Must visit in Seoul,Great park. Very relaxing. I came here when Chuseok and so many people spending time here. They played traditional games and we can try to play too., November 2017
267,5.0,Definitely worth a visit ,"Loved the views as it had been 25 years since I was here, amazing to see how the city had changed from above... and how much it had stayed the same.", December 2017
268,3.0,Nice,It is a nice park and you can visit it after the North Seoul tower - this is what we did. Nice but nothing special., November 2017
269,5.0,Great park,Very worthwhile across the Street from Grand Hyatt walked every day quiet relaxing the fall colours were beautiful was also there last Feb even though winter was still nice amazing city views and history there, November 2017
270,4.0,Short Hike!,I would go everyday if I live here!  I highly recommend to take a hike up and enjoy the view while taking a quick rest, November 2017
271,5.0,Amazing beautiful scenery ,"We bought the two ways cable car ride but ended walking down from the peak of Namsan Park as we could not resist the beautiful scenery and view. The walk down the main road was very pleasant and we were greeted with colourful autumn trees along the way. The cable car which is a single large car was packed with people standing close to each other. Fortunately it was only a short ride of less than 10 minutes. Once we reached the peak, we were rewarded with amazing beautiful scenery of the whole city and the place was very clean and well maintained.  Recommendation: Take a one way cable car up to the TOP and then walk down. As the peak is already very high and provided a very good view of the whole city, I suggest to skip the N Seoul Tower which will not make much of a different and you can save some cost as you need to buy ticket for the N Seoul Tower.Go in the evening to catch the sunset.", November 2017
272,4.0,Three hours trail,"You should be able to finish the circling trail in to three hours comfortably. i would recommend to begin from nandaemun, take the free lift up to the cable car ticket box, take left direction of the trail, visit historical Hanbok village enroute, and finish your trip at Seoul tower. At night you may take a bus down to a tourist destination. I asked the tower ticket box for the information of bus.", November 2017
273,5.0,Started my day high over Seoul,"Stayed at the Millennium Hilton my first night in Seoul after flying from the U.S. awoke early and hike to Seoul tower via Namsan Park. Very nice walkway, lighting where needed, and many spectacular views of Seoul as the sun rose. Great Way to take advantage of first-night jet lag!", November 2017
274,4.0,"Worth a trip up here to catch the city views & enjoy the relaxing, nice atmosphere.....","The main path to here is a short 10-15mins walk along the main road from Myeongdong.Once here, take the small Ormi Elevator up a very short slope up to the main building (queues can be very long- on the way down as well.Then buy a ticket for the cable car ( single big Ropecar), which takes you all the way up to Namsan Park( surprising it is quite high up the mountain). Its a normal weekday & the queues were very long!You can also drive or walk up to the main building, if you know the way.The view at the top is what one would expect from such a height - you can see the whole city 360°.Don't come in the night. Yes, the lights looks great at night from so high but frankly, night scenes all looked the same everywhere in the world, from similar attractions.We were there in early evening & could appreciate the actual city views in daylight. And we caught the sunset as well!If you are willing to fork out more fees, then go up the Namsan Tower. But I don't think it is worth it as that extra few feet up on the Tower is not going to make a major significant difference as this park is already so high up in the mountain.Avoid going on weekends or holidays. I can anticipate a long nightmare queues for the Ormi Elevator & the Cable car.", November 2017
275,5.0,"Highly recommend to hike, especially during autumn!","The park is so beautiful during autumn! I highly recommend hiking up to N Seoul Tower instead of taking the cable car. You will walk among the beautiful red and golden leaves, pass by ancient city walls, took lots of pictures which turn up amazing especially during sunset, and save a couple thousand won to spend in Myeongdong. The walk is not that hard (LOTS of stairs) and the trail is easy. Sunset view is really incredible from the observation deck on top.", November 2017
276,4.0,Beautiful view from the obsevatory,"A 10minutes walk from Myeongdong metro station to the Orumi Elevator brought us to the cablecar to Namsan Park and the iconic Seoul tower. The queues for the cablecar was long but very well managed by the staff in charge.It was peak autumn, so the autumn foliage was amazing. We spent about an hour or so to enjoy the panaromic views above. It was an enyoyable evening with nice views, but personally, this would not be the most important Seoul attraction to visit if you have limited time in the city.", November 2017
277,5.0,Excellent cable car ride to the peak,"We go there before sunset by riding the cable car to the top of the peak. During the ride, we can see magnificent yellow and red leaves over the whole mountain. Shortly after our arrival to the peak, we can see the beautiful sunset. Nice place and a must visit place in Seoul", November 2017
278,4.0,Afternoon hike with a sunset view,"My mom jokingly told us that she was trying to save our spending money by asking us to walk up the mountain to Namsan tower.  It was actually so that we can pass by the ancient city walls and to see the sun set.  The hike was tiring but the paved steps made it easier.  Views were breathtaking once you arrive at the deck area. Definitely try this afternoon hike.  Photos end up amazing, you get some exercise and you save a couple thousand won. Haha", November 2017
279,4.0,A fun park on the mountain,"Nam Mountain has a lot to do, including the hiking, the tower and the cable car. Wait until you have one of Seoul's rare clear days to get the most of the experience.", October 2017
280,4.0,Fun outing with family,"We spent half a day there till evening. Tickets bought from Klook, good deal. My daughter was the only reason why we went to Hello Kitty Land (and she thinks this is the best vacation ever!). We have been to bigger Hello Kitty spaces before and personally I wasn't impressed but then again I'm not 6. We were very lucky to be treated with a comedian magician and spent half an hour sitting and watching his show. Namsan Observatory was a great view of Seoul. We ate at one of the Korean restaurants and food was excellent.. I was annoyed at myself for buying ONE lock while queueing up for the cable car for $10USD at the cable car . You can actually buy from a lovely variety when you reach the top. For $10USD u can at least get 2 big locks AND a marker. Overall, it was a wonderful memory for our family.", October 2017
281,5.0,Great place to visit,Great place to visit. An iconic place in Seoul that one cannot miss while visiting Seoul. many things to see and experience., September 2017
282,4.0,Fun Times,Namsam Park gets you to N Seoul Tower which is a must if you're in the area. Not too far from Myeondong is the cable car that will take you up to the top and allow you access to roam about and see the tower and get some great shots. The cable car will take you up and down for a small fee if you don't mind waiting in line. You can get some great shots of the city as well., October 2017
283,5.0,A great way to get to the N Seoul tower.,"The wait to ride the tram is the only downside.  We waited just over an hour in line.  The ride was worth it.  The views are spectacular at the top. Not as good as at the top of the tower, but still impressive.  Worth the wait.", October 2017
284,4.0,Busy but worth the time to explore,"I visited Namsan Park over 2 separate days, first time was during the day where I decided to hike around the trails up to N.Tower and back down another trail which lead me to the National Theatre of Korea. There are many trails within the park and each one is leisurely and not too tough, a lot of steps but it is worth the effort. In the midst of a busy city there is this wonderful park to hike around is a gift. My re-visit was early evening to see the city all lit up at night and this time, I opted to go up the glass elevator to the cable car ride up. Having experienced both the hike up and cable car, I would recommend that you do both if you get the chance but if you had to pick one I would recommend the hike as there was something soothing about the hike up. N Tower at the top is pretty much a tourist point with great views of the city, the toilets up the tower surprised me as each cubicle had a window to the outside world, peeing in full view of the city was a novelty factor for sure.", October 2017
285,5.0,Great Walk & Views,A wonderful place for a walk before heading up to Seoul Tower. The colours of the leaves make for great scenery and fantastic views, October 2017
286,5.0,Must go,"Great park with cable car to the top with access to the N tower, restaurant, coffee shops and gift shop.", October 2017
287,5.0,Lovely Place,"Nice place with a great view! You can go around and see lots of lovely locks and trees! The cue for the cable car going up was a bit long but it's okay because it was moving. From Myeong-Dong, suggest you wait for the free shuttle going to Namsan Park as it is uphill. You can get it by subway exit 2.", October 2017
288,5.0,There's much more as well as N Seoul Tower.,"This is the mountain park locating in the center of Seoul. Lots of visitors just come and go via a cable car or a bus. They just stay near N Seoul Tower and leave. But, there are definitely many other ways to enjoy Namsan Park.- Observatories(남산전망대)There are a few observatories other than the peak. Mostly locating along paved trail way. Observatory 'Namsan Tower Middle Point(남산타워중간전망대)' is the closest from the peak and nice to watch N Seoul Tower from the distance.- Baekbeom Park(백범공원)The quiet park near Namdaemun Gate. There aren't many visitors in a wide area. The city wall of Joseon Dynasty is still remaining and good to walk and take beautiful photos.- Namsan Open Air Botanical Garden(남산야외식물원)This is a very well-maintained botanical garden. Starts from Hyatt Hotel, Hannam-Dong close from Itaewon.- Trails(남산산책로)There are paved and unpaved trail ways. They both are nice and easy. 2~3 hours is enough. Not at the level of average mountain climbing. Paved trail way starts from near Baekbeom Park and Namsan Library. The starting points of unpaved are many.There are flowers, small animals, birds and some attractions(archery, gym, etc.)- Lots of first comers fail to reach the bust stop to go up the top. Since driveways on the mountain exists only one and one way road, buses go up from Gukrim Geukjang (National Theater - northeast) and go down to Namsan Library(southwest). If a visitor got the wrong way, he/she has to head for Gukrim Geukjang or preceding stops by bus or taxi. Or cable car entrance. But, if he/she is near Namsan Library already, taking a walk is recommended. It's quicker and cheaper. This is the mountain of only 270m high and the trail way is well-paved.", October 2017
289,5.0,Fantastic views,This was a really nice morning.  You can get some nice views of Seoul from here.  Can get thr cable car (see reviews) or walk. Lot of steps however not too difficult maybe 30 mins. I got the car up and walked down. Can see the N tower too and just soak it in. Not really too busy as there's a lot of space., October 2017
290,5.0,Very Beautiful ,We spent a considerable amount of time walking and sitting in this garden. Lots of little areas to see and u can walk from garden to Seoul Tower. Lots of stairs so not ideal for strollers or those with an aversion to stairs., October 2017

294,5.0,Good view of Namdaemun area,"We used the metro subway and exited at Hoehyeon station. We walked up the hill and explored Namsan Park. It was a cool and relaxing walk and the views were great and the park was beginning to show the beautiful autumn colours. You could see the N Seoul Tower here and you can use the Namsan cable car if you prefer not to walk. However, we feel that walking is the best option as you get to stop and smell the flowers and admire the natural scenery.", October 2016
