95,5.0,I looooove love love this place! Especially the park at Yeoido.,"The title says just about everything - I love the Hangang park at Yeoido so much. I hung out there three nights in a row while I was in Seoul, as well as after church at the nearby megachurch (Yeoido Full Gospel Church is a 15 minute walk away - it's the largest megachurch in the world with over 1,000,000 members if you're interested in attending!). There are always tons of buskers there singing and performing, so there is entertainment. The second time I went there was also a fireworks show over the river. There's a famous sign there that says ""I Seoul U"" as well, which makes for good pics during the day and at night. When I went a couple nights ago, it was also lightly raining so everything was just beautiful. There are little stores where you can get bingsu as well, and just eat and hang out. If you want to get right to the good part of the park, take the subway and get off at Yeoinaru station. Don't make the same mistake I did and get off at Yeoido station (I thought it was closest to the church, turns out Yeoinaru is MUCH closer, and I got lost looking for it). Oh and there are also food trucks right outside the park if you're into that kind of food, and a Gong cha (my favorite boba place) next door to the church (i.e. about 15 minutes away by foot). It's a really chill place to hang out, and you can get food delivered there and drink outside and everything, it's all totally legal (and acceptable!). I highly recommend going with a friend and hanging out on the grass, or just going alone with your boba and a journal to write and be in peaceful solitude like I did! :D", August 2017

We joined the crowd and walked through the shallow ponds. As we sat there with our legs dipped in the water, we are mesmerized by the view of happy people out there.
