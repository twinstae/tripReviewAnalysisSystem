6,4.0,Do what locals do! Picnic and Han river view.,"I visited this park because I was missing a ´local´ experience. Though I love Seoul and especially all the historical sites, I wanted to see what locals do in this town. It was recommended by a business contact of mine when I asked him why there is almost no movement at all on the Han river and he explained to me that almost all transportation of goods happens over land so the river isn´t really used a lot. What people do, is visit and look at the river, enjoy it´s wide open space while it cuts through Seoul. The place to experience this is the Hangang park (metro Yeouinaru), where especially on friday afternoon thousands of Corean youth gather and have picnics, meet with friends or with a date and just sit and talk. The Hangang park is really wide and stretched along side the river bank, so you can stroll for hours, rent a bike, buy some food at the foodtrucks and watch people have a great time. I recommend you to buy food, some beers or sodas, a blanket and have a picnic before going on a stroll!As a bonus you will have an amazing background scenery of (one of the) Seoul skylines.", September 2019

Even the building on Sebitseom were empty and partially closed. We ended up walking from Sebitseom to Dongjak bridge where we took the subway.

But you could order food there with the different delivery guys.It’s also great visiting there in the daytime.  The park is huge so you will not get bored.", May 2017
86,5.0,Awesome for Night Picnics in the Fall!,"We went there on a Saturday night, and the place was just alive with crowds of friends and families spreading out their mats just about everywhere and talking and laughing. There were buskers every few meters to add to the fun atmosphere and old ladies handing out flyers for local delivery shops. We ordered chicken and bought beer and found ourselves a spot. There are public bathrooms nearby, carts that sell mats and some snacks for those who didn't bring any, and convenience stores if you run low on drinks. It was just so fun. You can rent bikes too.", October 2017

88,4.0,Tip for you to enjoy Seoul like local people,"As the review below, it seems like there is nothing to do in hangang itself. Only river, and track to run or for bike. But let me give you tips to enjoy Seoul like a local. 1. If you want to explore hangang, there are plenty of options. You can take one day kayak class, or just rent a kayak in Ttukseom recreation area, which is western side of river. 2. You can also have a cruise dinner while enjoying the beautiful night view of Seoul. There are some restaurants able to do this. 3. What does real local people do? After work, we run to river with chicken and beer, and enjoy ChiMak (we call Chimak for fried chicken + beer) watching river!", September 2017
89,5.0,"Nice place, but nothing to do","the Hanang Park is a nice place and there is water and you can go and stay there for a couple of days. And there is a big sign that says I SEUOL U, but to get to the sign it is a 10 min walk from the entrance, it was a very nice long walk, but it was hot. Along the way to going to the sign we came across stores, food shop, lots of tents, rental bikes and people flying kites. And the nice thing is that most of the people brought tents and they were sitting in there tents eating and thee wasn't even one spot that they littered or that they made dirty, everything was SO CLEAN, even the stores and the shop.I recommend you come in the night because it will be a very nice place. I recommend the Hangang park", October 2017

You can rent bikes, camp grounds, etc.  Along its impressive length, there are water shows, water park resorts, restaurants.  It really is an impressive array.", September 2017
95,5.0,I looooove love love this place! Especially the park at Yeoido.,"The title says just about everything - I love the Hangang park at Yeoido so much. I hung out there three nights in a row while I was in Seoul, as well as after church at the nearby megachurch (Yeoido Full Gospel Church is a 15 minute walk away - it's the largest megachurch in the world with over 1,000,000 members if you're interested in attending!). There are always tons of buskers there singing and performing, so there is entertainment. The second time I went there was also a fireworks show over the river. There's a famous sign there that says ""I Seoul U"" as well, which makes for good pics during the day and at night. When I went a couple nights ago, it was also lightly raining so everything was just beautiful. There are little stores where you can get bingsu as well, and just eat and hang out. If you want to get right to the good part of the park, take the subway and get off at Yeoinaru station. Don't make the same mistake I did and get off at Yeoido station (I thought it was closest to the church, turns out Yeoinaru is MUCH closer, and I got lost looking for it). Oh and there are also food trucks right outside the park if you're into that kind of food, and a Gong cha (my favorite boba place) next door to the church (i.e. about 15 minutes away by foot). It's a really chill place to hang out, and you can get food delivered there and drink outside and everything, it's all totally legal (and acceptable!). I highly recommend going with a friend and hanging out on the grass, or just going alone with your boba and a journal to write and be in peaceful solitude like I did! :D", August 2017
96,4.0,Nice waterfront park,We went there at evening because it was too hot to visit the park at daytime during summer. There were a lot of visitors both local and foreign. It was good for walking along the river. There were also many different activities offered at night time., August 2017

99,5.0,ONE OF THE BEST PARK I EVER WENT,"Its one of the best park i must say, its clean and very cold specially at night. Alot of activities to do but if you feel to relax and makes you feel your in Korea you must go here. Just bring your snacks while resting here .", May 2017
100,5.0,People friendly park and best resting area,"I live in Seoul. But as originally from a small city in one province, I 've always missed the mother nature that can be found fully in my hometown.For me who gets tired a city life, Han river is a great soothing place. As large as enough to compare to a sea, by delivering cool winds and the location where I can glance at colorful lives of others, it comforts me a lot. In totall there are more than 20 bridges across the river, and along the river a long park stretches down, where many convenient facilities are installed, such ad like convenient stores, bicycle rental shops, toilets, ferry decks, retaurants and museums. From season to season, you can various shows and events going on. My favorite activity there is to ride a bicycle.To a traveller, I recommend to take a ferry and do bicycling, and most importantly try to eat Chi-mac(chicken and beer) like locals. It is the most popular menue for Koreans when we have casual gatherings. Feel the breeze and relax and the history of us that has lived togethet with the river and its bridges for more than a half century.", August 2017
101,5.0,"Park, River and Views","Hangang Park is like other parks adjacent to a river, however this park is designed with a couple of commercial structures that light up at night, galleries of food trucks and a view of the Bampo bridge that illuminates at night with water display show. Definitely recommend.", July 2017
102,5.0,Best place in Seoul,The river park is a quiet place that feels almost completely removed from the city. I've gone many times to relax or exercise when I feel stressed from the bustle of the crowded city. All the people I've encountered there all act totally different in the majesty of the serenity. It is a reprieve for nature folks such as myself., July 2017
103,3.0,A place for the youngster,"I was there in weekend and on a cloudy day. So many young people was there to skate, cycle, and even camping. The entire place was colourful and lively. Some food trucks and hawkers were selling mostly BBQ and noodle. But I felt it was quite boring to me (maybe I am getting old?), and a bit disappointed as I saw a lot (yes, a lot) of trash scattering around!!!", July 2017
104,5.0,My Favorite Place in Seoul!,"The Hangang Park is actually the entire system of parks and biking/walking path that parallels the Han River and tributaries on both sides all throughout and beyond Seoul.  Rent a bike (available at stations throughout town or at shops on the river) and spend a few hours just riding along the path to take in the sights.  Sometimes its even faster than car or subway.  Some notable areas are the path around the Banpo bridge, particularly at night when they put on a lighted water fountain display.  Picnics are also a great way to enjoy the park.", July 2017
105,5.0,Spend many hours at this park ,"This is an amazing park along the river. There is so much you can do here. Can really recommend to hire a bike or tandem bike for 2-3 hours.

106,4.0,"Cycle, picnic, stroll, take photos","There's plenty to do at the Hangang Park, that is if you have the time.WE took the subway to Yeouinaru station and got out at exit 2.This is where you'll find their iconic ""I SEOUL U"" signage.To rent a bike, you come out of the station, go further up front towards the river, and at the main walking path, turn either to the left or to the right and walk about 100M and you'll find their bicycle rental booths. Cycling is the fastest way to cover and see more area but you'll need to return you bike to the same station you rent it from to collect your security deposit of your passport or identity card.Even with walking, you can still enjoy the air, the scene and many photo stops. Convenient stores selling instant noodles, snacks and drinks are nearby.", June 2017
107,5.0,Great outdoor activities!,We came here by subway and it's so easy with that. We went there on Friday evening so there was so many truck food. With the live band playing.

114,4.0,Great outdoor activity along a beautiful river,"Inspired by the recent Korean dramas featuring bicycling on the Hangang, my daughter and I decided to try the bike rentals and see the sights on wheels. Managed to download a pretty good guide on Bicycling-Along-the-Hangang from visitseoul and started at Yeouido Park after getting out at Yeoinaru station. The bike station was easily spotted on the right (if you stand facing the river). Have an ID card handy to register for the bikes. Cost is about 3000 won per hour. Bikes are pretty new and have baskets to carry your stuff.The bike paths are well maintained but are not all flat. Some effort required for slopes. Maybe because it was a Sunday, we met with many other ""serious"" cyclists who were polite but kept overtaking us. Only complaint is that the signages were mainly in Korean and we didn't know half the time which bridges we were at. As a result we missed the crossing and didn't make it to Seoul forest. A good place to go across the river to the other side is on the Rainbow bridge. Keep cycling till you come to a traffic light along the path with car access. This bridge also has a water display at certain times of the day.Lots of convenient stores along the way to stop for a drink and snack. There was even a concert with live kpop bands.Scenery is beautiful but weather was a bit hot already in May. Would cycle again in cooler weather on a different route.", May 2017

118,5.0,Ttukseom Resort Station Park,"The park on the side of Ttukseom Resort Station was really good fun. Enjoyed the skateboard park twice during my trip, many ramps and large skatable area to practise. There is also convenient bicycle rental and many convenience stores along the way to get food and drinks. There is a public pool there too but it was not open yet.", June 2017
119,4.0,"Incredibly large, well-maintained park with tons of activities","I've visited this park with my husband several times since we moved to Seoul 9 months ago and plan to continue going once our baby arrives this spring. It is a fabulous park that we find is always clean and well-maintained. The park has plenty of inexpensive parking and options for restrooms and refreshments throughout. The park itself is huge and spans quite a length of the Han river. I doubt you could see it all in a day. However, it's a lot of fun to spend time here on nice weather days. We like that there are separate walking and bike paths along the river - it means much less risk of getting flattened by bicyclists than other parks we have been to. There are also wonderful sweeping views of the city skyline to be seen from this park - bring your camera! We have also observed children's playgrounds, basketball courts, soccer fields, picnic pavilions, sculpture gardens, water sports and water taxis, waterfront dining, and other attractions at Hangang park. We would definitely recommend this park to fellow nature lovers.", May 2017
120,5.0,Good for a gentle bike ride,A great park with many different things to see and do.I recommended hiring out a bike and riding alongside the river. Ask at the desk for a good route.

126,4.0,quiet walk in autumn,"Hangang Park covers a vast area of land, both sides of the Han river. From Itaewon, the floating island is just a bus away. The park can also be accessed from different start points using the subway, one is via Exit5 of Express bus terminal station. I visited the park last 2015 for the sunset. I chose to walk around while waiting, but bikes can also be rented if you want to cover a much larger part of the park. It was spectacular looking the at the at the silhouettes of buildings, the bridge and Namsan tower appear as the sun sets. Unplanned, I dropped by at the park at night and I was at awe with the illumination of one of the structures on the floating island. I saw a lot of couples that night, and I can't blame them for choosing the place despite the cold. Oh so rrromantic!", October 2016
127,4.0,An off-the-beaten track experience,"We came here to take the Hangang River cruise. After the cruise, we lingered here for quite a while to enjoy the walk along the river and witness a part of the lives of Seoulites. Hangang Park is a bustling place for young people and citizens to come here for recreational and sports activities. There were many people cycling, picnicking and doing water sports here.

My favorite thing at this park definitely has to the Moonlight Rainbow Fountain. During the day, you can see the natural rainbow. At night, there is laser rainbow show. The fountain show from April to October. The rainbow jets of water stretch 1,140 meters. It creates a fantastic view over the river along with 200 colorful lights.

The day I went a few people were jogging and riding bike. you have great views of N Seoul Tower and there is a sign I SEOUL U, where you can take good pictures. There is a ferry and also a place where concerts are held but because it was winter, they were close.

I don't remember where the place was where I rode a bicycle but I hoped that there would be more places to eat something. Anyway scenery was great, bicycle was good too and I had lot of fun. Especially on sunny day you can see many korean people enjoying of their free time. You can just go and sit somewhere, maybe walk a little bit or rent a bicycle which I recommend.

It is a cool place to hang out with friends and family for a picnic and fly kites. You'll see a lot of family bringing their kids to just hang out and play sport or games.

146,3.0,Hang-ing by the river,"Well, it is what it is - a riverside park. There isn't much to do here, except to just take a leisurely stroll along the river and enjoy the wind and the waters for a while, maybe even snap some pictures.There used to be more food outlets here, but they have since closed down and are now replaced by convenience stores. Still, if you do want to get food, you can buy them from the pushcarts selling food like kimbab and tteokbokki, although these are priced a little more expensive.The best time to visit this place is actually in early October, for the Seoul International Fireworks Festival (서울세계불꽃축제). But if you are going for the festival, do head down to the park early even though the opening ceremony only commences at 7pm. In fact, you should be there by around 4pm to reserve a nice spot in the park to get a good view of the fireworks. If you don't have a picnic mat, fret not because there will be people selling. Likewise, there will be a lot of pushcarts on that day, so you don't have to worry about food while watching the fireworks either.To get to the park, I recommend taking the Seoul Subway to Yeouinaru Station (Line 5) and going out from exit 4. The park is right in view when you exit the station.", October 2016
147,5.0,One of the great places to hang out meet the locals,Fall and Spring are excellent times to visit this enormous park. Check out the different options depending on where you go. Both sides of the river are wide green spaces even though there is always a freeway nearby. Seoul has done an amazing job at assuring that the river front is a relaxing place. Bike paths are every way and a separate walking/hiking trail is available. If you a bit outside of the main city center you will find some well restored natural parts for bird watching and a sense of wilderness which is hard to come by in this city., September 2016

Actually, when I am on the subway, sometimes it will pass on the river, it is really beautiful. This time we go to Hangang Park to have a look. As we entered the park, it is full of local people or tourists. The greenish area there is quite large. You can see many people doing different sports there. Like riding a bicycle, playing football swimming and so on. I have a picnic with my friends sitting on the grass. I enjoy the sunshine and fresh air there. It makes me comfortable.

There were families camping out and kids were having a great time playing in the park and in the ponds. The water was flowing and it was cool, much like the water from a mountain stream. We joined the crowd and walked through the shallow ponds. As we sat there with our legs dipped in the water, we are mesmerized by the view of happy people out there.

It's good to see with colorful light and for this reason, it is called Rainbow Fountain.There is a spacious parking lot in the southern part of Banpo Bridge. And another good place is a underneath bridge below Banpo Bridge. This bridge is called ""Jamsu Bridge"" in Korean which means it is overflooded with heavy rain in Summer. You may walk and acrosse Han River just over its surface. It is one of my favorate driving path in Seoul as well.During night, the floating islands called ""Sevit Islands"" are good to drop by. These there places are good to go on foot.", October 2016

166,4.0,What a nice park!,"Seoul has really put together some wonderful places for the residents to get out of the urban concrete highrise filled dongs and back to nature, and Hangang Park is one of the great ones. We visited at night, pre Eland Cruise, and it looked like a place that would be a go-to weekend destination of mine if I were to live in Seoul. Walking and biking paths along the Riverside, a beautifully sloped grassy rise perfect for picnicking with views of the Seoul skyline, it was very nice and seemingly much appreciated  by the locals as many were out enjoying the evening- mostly couples naturally.  Is it a tourist destination? Not so much if you have limited time in Seoul but if you are going to the river cruise, building 63, or even the huge wet market it is worth taking an extra 1/2 hour to go stop by for a visit!", October 2016

Due to the proximity of the Gangnam neighborhood, you can easily explore the shops and cafes of Sinsa-dong Garosu-gil.", October 2016

183,5.0,Believe it or not!,"In the early 90's during one of the major storms in Korea, I was in Korea on the Metro crossing the Hangang river and the river had risen very close to the track.  So this is a must on your visit to Seoul, visit the beautiful parks built on both sides of the Han river. Now this is the believe it or not,  and  but from the park, look up to the Metro rail, take a photo, and then make a mental picture of how much water was flowing down the river. Wow.

There are many things to do on the waterfront... dance, have a meal or picnic, walking, etc., but it is the bicycle paths that make this such an enjoyable place to visit.

Though Seoul is a big city with lots of buildings and traffic, it does have a lot of greenery and hills (I thought of Seattle or San Francisco) throughout the city that I loved. But, this park had something else (perhaps it was the proximity to water). It was a well planned and designed park for cyclists and pedestrians, there were the mini-gyms spaced out through the park, small gazebos where people were relaxing or picnicking, and lots of beautiful greenery.  It made me forget I was in a city (as long as I didn't look across the river)!", July 2016

We went early evening and it was a blast.  If you want to the left, under the bridge - keep going til you get to the fountain area, you can rent bikes to ride the trails. So much fun. You can also have a picnic there - we had chicken delivered - you can pretty much have anything delivered to you at the park to eat, but I would not recommend that unless you have a Korean with you to make the call and explain where you are located in the park. There is a convenience store to buy drinks - vendors - and you can even buy or rent these shiny square pads to sit down on the ground for a picnic from the vendors.
