0,5.0,No more museum excites more,"Unforgettable experience! Museum located in unexpected area of Hongik Uni. Before entering u download an app in which U make photo or video. Better video because it will provide u with amazing special effects like in fantasy movies. Every corner of the museum has its own thematic venue. Kids shall be definitely happy. There is also an ice museum with ice sculptures but it’s too tight. Better come early in the morning as it will be crowded and u need a time and space to make quality videos. Better leave clothes and unnecessary stuff in locker box. 100% recommended even if u don’t like boring museums. It is more than museum, it is an adventure.", January 2020
1,5.0,Absolutely worth a visit and so much fun!,"We had such a great time here. There is an App you download when you go in which brings the place to life. We had so much fun taking videos and pictures and there is even an opportunity to get your portrait done as an oil painting, which was a great keepsake to take home. A great tip for couples, take a tripod so you can get shots of both of you!", January 2020
2,5.0,Really cool place,This place is a lot of fun! I was traveling alone so I got a guide to accompany me so I could get some great photos. They have an app that works with some of the exhibits to get you some really cool videos and photos., September 2019
3,5.0,Worth it!,"The ice museum on the side is not really worth a visit, especially if you have seen ice sculptures elsewhere. Little kids would love it though.The Trick Eye concept is very clever - though sharing your photos with them might be risky. It is only 12000w entry, and a nice diversion from the shopping. Worthwhile even without teenagers. Future museums will all have this special effects capability. Clever", December 2019
4,3.0,Need to go with a teen or 20 something,"I visited this attraction with my wife and teenage daughters. I would not call it a museum but rather, an attraction. I am in my early 50s and don't have an intuitive understanding of how to manipulate the VR to maximum effect. My daughter, on the other hand, is masterful. Without her I would have been lost.The attraction is a series of rooms that you can take still pictures or videos. Some of the scenes require a few people in them. In many, your head is superimposed on the scene and in others, there is a lot of movement using VR. It's all quite clever but all i really need is one or two rooms, as opposed to many.If you have someone in your party to show you how to do things and you get into the mood, it can be fun. The ticket also includes a ridiculous ice museum that is really not worth visiting.", December 2019
