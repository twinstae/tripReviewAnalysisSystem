1,5.0,Enjoyed a colorful night beside the river .,"A quite beautiful and colorful fountain display from the ""Banpo Bridge"". You can enjoy the display after every half an hour from evening till 9:00 pm. Great place for refreshments and fresh air.", October 2019
2,5.0,Different kind of light show,"Quite a distance walking from express bus terminal metro station, anyway it is worth it watching the light shower where water jets coming out from side of the bridge. The timing of shows are 7.30pm, 8pm, 8.30pm, 9pm. Each show lasts around 20mins. There are some food stalls nearby where you can get a quick snack. Restaurants and cafes are also available.", October 2019
3,3.0,Better seen from the hanging cafe on the Dongjak bridge,"If you want to get a better view of the entire Banpo bridge go to the hanging cafe on the Dongjak bridge, you will see steams of colored water. If you want to see it up close, take the #9 line and exit at the express bus terminal, follow the signs and you will walk about 20 minutes along Banpo-daero until you find the entrance to go under the bridge, follow the signs that say floating island and walk another 10 minutes to Banpo Hangang Park. Make sure to check for schedule of shows. When we went there there were only 3 20 minute shows starting at 8 pm every 1/2 hour. From here you can walk to the man-made floating islands to watch the colorless steams of water and the bright colored lights underneath. I recommend 1 to 2 hours mostly because it takes time to get there.", October 2019
4,5.0,Great on an evening ,"I loved this area! Went on a Friday night, watched the show which was very relaxing! Then walked over through all the other buildings, and a night market with food trucks! I think its worth seeing, and ita free!", September 2019
