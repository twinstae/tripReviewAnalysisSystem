11,2.0,Not recommended for street foods,"This is a market mainly focused in optical products, knock off clothes and not very authentic souveniers that are made in China. Go to Gwangjang Market if you are looking for some street foods, Go to Myeongdong if you are planning to do some shopping. Worth a visit if you are trying to get yourself a new pair of glasses, but you will probably be overcharged if you are a foreigner. Bring one of your Korean friends. Since it is very close to Myeongdong maybe a 30 min quick stop would not harm you if you do not expect too much.", January 2020

If I needed something I knew I could go there and find it.  The best items on my list were outdoor gear.  The market had many vendors for hiking and climbing boots and shoes, crampons, clothing hats, walking sticks, energy bars, you name it, they have it.  Plus you get to people watch. There was one elderly Korean lady who set up her old sewing machine in the alley way and was making her living in public.

55,5.0,Bargain Market,"If you are looking for any bargains in Seoul then I recommend going to Namdaemun Market near the centre of Seoul. A busy bristling market full of people, clothing, food, accessories and lots more. This market fills every corner of the 6-8 streets that holds it within a small square area of Seoul and is a great place to explore and buy presents for back home. Namdaemun market appears to be mostly a clothing market and accessories like bags, sunglasses and watches but it also has plenty of food and drink vendors stationed around the various corners of the market. You can find some cheap bargains in here including dress trousers, football tops, bags and much more. And some of the imitations would fool anyone on the more luxurious branded items. It was so good I went back three times during my two week break in Seoul and I still think I only explored half the market so I guess I will just have to go back next time.", September 2019
56,5.0,Nice quaint night market,This area is well known and a must see. Especially if you like a bargain or street food. There are several adjoining streets and an interesting place to go at night. It's also not too far to walk for Myoungdong night market., September 2019

66,5.0,Take It All in,"There is much to see here. At first I was not interested as I had been to another market and I didn't really know why I would want to explore more stalls and why I would need numerous,  inexpensive trinkets. Still, I kept walking and the next thing you know I was very interested in the market. It's interesting to see coffee shops, run by a single person, tucked between perhaps a little jewelry stand and a store selling hats. You will see all types of products, from leather jackets to $3 earrings. You will find all types of fried foods, being prepared right before your eyes. We'll find a complete alleyway of nothing but restaurants. Other food kiosks are scattered about. On one side of the market is fronted by quite a few camera shops and I even bought a lens. Well, I guess that says I was having a pretty good time.", September 2019
67,5.0,great bargain spot for shoes and bags,"Visited this place on our ten day summer holiday last week. Lively place with hundreds of shops and stalls selling all types of Korean made shoes, bags, scarves and a lot of other goods. Lots of fake item shops, make sure you bargain well and hard. Great food stalls as well.", August 2019
68,5.0,Can spend half a day here,"Loved the market. One can easily spend half a day window shopping or shopping and trying out some street food. Pity that we got to spend only a couple of hours there since we were specifically looking for luggage. Would have loved to browse through the shops much longer and walk around. Definitely go there while visiting Seoul. Price wise, I did not see any great deals, some shops are open to bargaining and some are not. Nothing was really marked down. Nevertheless a great place to browse and look at things that you do not need :)", August 2019

72,5.0,Shopping,So there is the day time shopping and night time shopping. If your looking for kids clothes you can come after 10pm to 5am. On #6 you can find many kids clothing stores. The key to getting a discount is buy more than one piece. I think the minimum is 3 and up. So we bought on this trip maybe 9 of the same kids sleep sack different colors and sizes to give to friends and it was much cheaper. For example a kids hat I bought was 15000won each but if I buy more than 3 it’s 9000won. If I buy three I save 3000won and get 3 hats! Anyway this is the deal and for accessories you need to buy by the dozens and many styles. The last time I came I bought hairpins for my kids and friends. They come out to 50cents each very cheap. There is usually less people at night and this is when the wholesale customers come so just be aware to get deals you must buy more. Also make sure you bring cash. This also helps since most money exchanges close before 10pm. Good luck shopping., August 2019

75,3.0,Big market but nothing special,"The market is big and bustling. It is more about lower quality, cheaper and fake goods. We thought it might have had more hand crafted things but it didn't.", August 2019
76,4.0,Large market,"The market covers several blocks of the city and just about anything can be bought here. Not really a tourist market, much more a real market. There are several good cheap eating places tucked away in the alleys. Many of the establishments have pictures to help choose your food. Good location for cheap eats.", July 2019
77,5.0,All you need in the heart of Seoul,There are two main shopping districts in Seoul for buying bulk items. Namdaemun and Dondaemun.  You'll find a lot of what you're looking for in Namdaemun plus you'll find plenty of places to feast your palate and stop for a drink after shopping.  A must see place while you're in Seoul.  It's a short walk from the subway where you can go anywhere in Seoul., November 2018
78,3.0,Too many shops,It was really difficult to buy anything as there were too many shops. Most of the shops sell very similar things from clothing to souvenirs. There malls are tightly packed with stalls selling yet again similar things. Also the fashion was more suitable for the older generation. Food was a let down here. The interesting was the guards from Deoksugung patrol here daily., July 2019

81,5.0,"Amazing local market and shops, could spend all day here.","In contrast to many other places in the world, Seoul is not super touristy and Namdaemun even less so. There's mainly Korean locals who shop and dine in the area so you won't really be got with tourist traps or tourist prices. Be careful eating at the street stalls though, you don't know if they're sanitising that stuff properly.  Lots of good souvenir shops too.", July 2019
82,5.0,Local Markets and Local Culture,Enjoyed so much more than Insadong market because it was more authentic and less typical retail. Many products were the same. Allow at least 2 hours. Enjoy!, August 2019
83,2.0,"Big market, many street food stalls but avoid the alley restaurants displaying their sample dishes","Big market selling lots of souvenirs and cheap wares. Plenty of food stalls to try, but avoid the alley restaurants displaying their wax dishes and calling you in - we tried one and the dishes that arrived looked nothing like what was advertised, tasteless and we got only half the dumplings displayed for the same price - was then told the front displays were “samples” only. Then they pretended they didn’t know what to do with a credit card - asking for cash - when there’s their machine right there and finally put it through on the card to give us a proper receipt. Really dodgy.", July 2019
84,3.0,It’s a market ,"It is extremely huge and you’ll probably get lost, it goes underground overground and the streets go on and on. Anything you can imagine you will find here.

We didn’t see the deep fried baby crab anywhere else and the dumplings were excellent. The busy hot and narrow food alleys with kitchens along the walkways were a sight to see if not too enticing to eat at. Nevertheless I thought the Gwangjang Market had much better food quality and variety and the Myeongdong street stalls had much more atmosphere in the evening so if you were time pressed I’d do these first., June 2019

Ended up in some mediocre Korea “restaurant” that sells a range of Korea food. So they say jack of all trade master of none, the food was not fantastic and they expect one main dish per pax. If you are there, please walk into a small alley which u see ppl queueing for grilled fish and steam egg. May be a better choice for authentic Korea food.", May 2019
