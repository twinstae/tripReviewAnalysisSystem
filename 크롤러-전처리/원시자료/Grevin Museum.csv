2,5.0,A day out with my Chaplain,"I took one of the Osan AB, Chaplain's , her assistant and a friend to the museum. It was great. I am from New York so hearing the Godfather music and seeing Al Pacino, and Robert De Niro sitting down was a huge surprise and great experience. Also the room with the Presidents was priceless. There were even exhibits of Kings and the Pope. I especially enjoyed seeing Chinese National riding a Horse next to Napoleon. You can even ride a bicycle next to ET! I have not smiled and laughed as much in years.", January 2019
3,5.0,Cool Wax Museum,"It was a warm day in Seoul on our day to visit the Palaces. We had a list of places to go to with our BTS edition of Discover Seoul Pass. This was one of the places to go to. It was cool and the place was full of figures of people we know, especially our Korean idols and famous leaders of the world.We took our time going from floor to floor and there were also other guests from our country, the Philippines. What was great about the place is that it was not just a museum of wax figures, they also had games and 3D figures you can have photo ops with. They also had a souvenir shop where we bought stuff of our idols ( G Dragon, LMH and KSH) It was a good afternoon for me and my son. We enjoyed it. We have been to a wax museum in HK but this was great because of our Kdrama and Kpop idols. Thanks Grevin Seoul, we had fun . Thanks too for sending souvenir photos through my email.", May 2019
4,3.0,Meet the Stars,Conveniently located near City Hall Subway station. It was easy to find. An opportunity to meet with many movie stars around the world.especially the Korean movie stars. An interesting wax museum...there were also digital games that you can play inside., April 2019
5,5.0,Fun museum,"I liked the Grevin museum, it was my first wax figures museum and I was really impressed with how real some of the statues looked. I had fun with Einstein and Steve Jobs at the pop quiz room and I enjoyed making photos with other celebrities like Al Pacino, Brad Pitt, Messi and the Queen. The museum has a section with only k-drama stars and k-pop artist and overall it was a fun day.", September 2018
6,4.0,Great ,"If you have spare time, this is a good option. The place was pretty much empty when we were there & we received 20% discount with our MasterCard.", January 2019
7,4.0,Wax museum,"Interesting museum to visit. However, the Asian stars doesn't look as realistic. We had fun playing with the interactive games though.", November 2018
8,4.0,Good stuff to do when in the city,Good place to spend an evening in Seoul. Some cool things to see and do here. Not a place to go multiple times, September 2018
9,5.0,Very good,"We went there on Monday  and I was surprised there was literally no other visitors but us. Around 4-5 people arrived later. Except taking photos you can also participate in some games at the museum which was kind of fun I think. They take your pics and send it to you via email later on. Also, the regular ticket price was 18kWon but you can get 10% discount if you pay with MasterCard.", November 2018

12,4.0,K-PoP Stars,"Free admission with the Seoul Pass. I only spent an hour snapping pictures with K-POP stars, Trump, Obama, etc political leaders around the world", September 2018
13,5.0,Great experience,"We went first thing in the morning on a weekday. Got in free with the Discover Seoul Pass. No queues, in fact only one other couple there in front of us and they quickly lost us.Great experience", October 2018
14,4.0,Grevin Museum- Seoul,So you won‚Äôt find much mention of this place among the top attractions in Seoul. However I think it‚Äôs definitely worth the visit if you have time to spare. They have quite a few games/ interactions so it keeps you entertained rather than just walking around the wax figures., June 2018
15,4.0,Great wax museum and rainy day activity,"The Grevin Museum is pretty well known so we were very enthusiastic about visiting it. As it happened, it was raining so visiting it was the perfect activity. Firstly, the pace is huge, so wear comfortable walking shoes.We took the lift to the top floor and worked our way through each level and at each floor walked down steps to the next level.Most of the wax figures were very recognizable and the great things about this museum is that you are allowed to interact with many of the figures for taking photos as well as there being many other ways of interacting. This ensured that our children had a great time.Whilst most of the wax figures were easily recognizable, some were less so, or at least less recognizable or exaggerated in their features such as the figure of Brad Pitt which was almost not recognizable in my opinion, and also the wax statue of Lady Diana which I felt was not so good.However, the whole family did thoroughly enjoy the museum and we must have spent at least two hours inside.The museum is well located in the city centre and being very close to City Hall and across the road from the Lotto department store and Duty Free shop.", July 2018
16,4.0,Grevin- Wax Museum,Really nice place to take pictures. I think that this is funny when you come in and you feel like the wax people are real people or that real people is wax people. I don‚Äôt think so that this is type of museum that you have to go there. But if you have free time pr it‚Äôs rainy day you can go there., July 2018
17,5.0,Great Experience Not To Be Missed,"Visited Grevin Museum ( Part of Discover Seoul Pass Free Entry) and found this to be the best valued attraction among their list of 21 free attractions.  Apart from the realistic Wax Figures, there were also some Trick Art Photo opportunities as well and some interactive games which you could play too.  Overall a very interesting Museum.  If you are looking for directions, you should download a local map navigation app called Naver and search for Geurebaeng Museum .  It will give you options to take either Bus, Metro, Taxi or Walking routes with estimated travel times and cost as well.", June 2018
18,5.0,Must see museum,"For me, it was the most interesting and funny museum which I have ever visited. Was confusing live people with their exhibits üòùüòùüòù", June 2018
19,4.0,Korean's Version of Wax Museum,"You can take pictures with live size famous people including Korean stars here. Interestingly, there are interactive stuff like piloting a plane so the whole experience wasn't just for picture moments.", May 2018
20,4.0,Interactive Games,"The tickets for this place was part of the Discover Seoul pass.I thought that this place was just a wax museum and was pleasantly surprised when it was a bit more than that. Keep your entrance ticket handy since that's what you use to play the mini games inside. Like other wax museums, you can pose with the actors for photo ops. Some of the displays or areas had games like roulette and landing (or in my case crashing) a plane. I thought that made it more interesting.Some of the wax statues were a bit hard to tell or unfamiliar but there were placards around so that you can figure out who you're looking at. Nice place to spend some time especially if you can recognise them all.", December 2017
21,3.0,Good enough to spend a couple of hours,Positives: we came in the afternoon and there were no crowds. We practically had the entire place to ourselves.Also there were a few interactive game exhibits where u can either play solo or with a friend.Negatives:There wasn't that many exibhits (only 3 floors) and some of them don't really look like the real person.I can't imagine spending more than 1-1.5 hours here. You can probably go though the entire place within 1 hour., May 2018
22,5.0,Great museum,"I am used to always doing the wax museum, which is usually always Madame Thussaud, I was pleasantly surprised to see that it is a museum Grevin in Korea. I was there with my little brother, there was almost no one who made the visit very pleasant. We were able to really take our time and laugh a lot. to see the stars of Kpop and Kdrama is really nice, especially for the fans.", April 2018
23,5.0,Interactive Visit,I booked the ticket through a travel app(Klook). I think I was charged less than lining up. It was a trip i need to fill in the gap between my departure time from incheon. I have about 7 hours before my flight and from the time I checked out. It was fun. The characters are interesting. Some familiar some not but still worth the trip., April 2018
24,4.0,If you wanna see your idols!,"We came in late at this place, like just one hour they weill close so we had to do everything in a rush, but it was a nice tour! It was 4floors full of waxes, just something quite disappointing though was the Lee Min Ho wax, he didn't look like him or any close to him, but the rest were fine especially G-DRAGON! There is also a shop there for you to shop all those Lee Min Hoo, BIGBANG and JGS goodies!", March 2018
25,3.0,Celebrity Sightings,"Celebrity sightings...well, in 'wax'.  Fun to walk about life-like statues of historic and contemporary celebrities.  It's a quick visit.", April 2018
26,5.0,Just a great place! ,The best way to be close from your idolsüòÇüòÇüòÇ had a lot of fun with my family and we took hilarious pictures!, October 2017
27,5.0,Nice place to visit,I enjoyed going to Grevin. The wax figures were very well done and there was a lot to see. They were divided up by theme rooms. I wish I would have went with someone. I could only take selfies which was hard. I recommend taking a friend if you want to take pictures with the figures. I also liked the interactive exhibits., February 2018
28,5.0,Best Wax Museum I've visited ,"It is definitely not the biggest (see MT), but delightfully the funnest wax museum encounter I have hade all over world. We did not intend to go, but given it was across from hotel dropped by, wow. The staging of the scenes adds so much fun, and even though we did not know many of K Celebs,  we quickly figured out their significance. If you have visited other  wax museums, you have to try this one in Seoul and discover a whole new immersive experience :)", February 2018
29,5.0,Nice Detour,We passed by the Grevin on our way back to our hotel. They have celebrities for all ages and lots of interactive games for the young and old. We had a great time with the realistic wax figures. Fun afternoon!, February 2018
30,4.0,Meet celebs here,"easy to reach from city hall, pretty cheap and fun games inside, also you can take picture with world celebs", September 2017
31,3.0,Nice place to visit,went to this place and tour starts at level 4. walked out from the elevator and shocked the atmosphere very quiet with deemed lights and you will see famous statue's. Some of the statue doesnt really look like to the celebrity. I was shocked that day where suddenly a staff was standing next to the statue suddenly moving. haha... i think they should say Welcome to Grevin, January 2018
32,5.0,Recommend to visit with friends!,I visited with a friend. Will definitely come back again and recommend to friendsTaking ridiculous pictures and I enjoyed interactive games.It was a good time ;)I got a 10% discount on Mastercard!, December 2017
33,5.0,Great to visit with friends,"My friends wanted to take pictures with G-dragon and korean drama stars so we went there and it turned out to be really fun. Of course for foreign Hallyu fans the experience is mostly attractive because of the korean celebreties, but in reality world stars are just as interesting. The fact that you can become a part of everything is also a plus. So many games and activities, in my opinion a very nice way to spend time with friends and get hundreds of picures. Their gift shop has official goods of korean celebrities which is also quite handy for those who is interested in this kind of thing. I would definitely recommend.", January 2018
34,5.0,Nice visit at the Grevin museum.,"My visit at the Grevin museum was just as expected. Great wax figures and a lot of fun and pictures.As other Grevin's, you can ""meet"" with great people :)It's nearby City hall and other area of interest, so if you happen to be around, you should definitely stop by. I also received a link to download a snapshot of some of my visit.If you want to see Barack Obama or Leonardo DiCaprio or even Gandhi, this is the right place. Don't forget to say hi to the Pope :)", December 2017
35,4.0,"Madamme Tussaud for Seoul, South Korea","We went there since our daughter wanted to see the Korean wax museum up close and personal! Not a bad place to visit. You should get the Discover Seoul Pass if you wanted to visit this museum so that it would be worth the money paid. Lots of wax artists or celebrities to see. We have been to the actual Madamme Tussaud in London so it is nothing compared to the real ones. The only different is you can catch the glimpse of the famous Lee Minho. Overall not a waste but then if you just want to visit the museum & pay the entrance fees of KRW18,000 then it is not worth it!", December 2017
36,4.0,Another place to visit in Seoul,"If you are already in the area of the stream, might as well pay a visit to this museum.  There is an entrance fee of 18000 won for adult.  The wax museum will start at the 4th floor down to the 1st floor.  If you are a fan of Korean stars, you can sit beside Lee Min Ho. You can also play the interactive games per area, I tried the simulation game of being a pilot and in order for you to lay the game, you have to scan your ticket code. At the end of the your you will be required to encode your email address so they can send all the pictures you had in the simulator, a wax figure of yourself and a lot more. They also have a 3D Gallery where you can take some pictures while holding the leaning tower, falling in a big hole and having a portrait in the plaza. You can allocate about 3 to 4 hours on this depending on how addicted you are on taking pictures. By the way you can have selfie with the stars and play casino with the ocean‚Äôs 11 cast.", December 2017
37,5.0,Take your sweet time and have fun at Grevin Museum,"Grevin Museum is composed by four floors. Each room has a theme and with it a matching sound  and light system, making the experience all the more realistic and engaging. After you buy your ticket you will be instructed by the staff to take the lift to the top floor and then you move your way down to the beginning area. Always keep your ticket at hand. You will need it to activate the interactive games and activities throughout your visit. You will be able to play the roulette with George Clooney and Brad Pitt, a basketball match with Michael Jordan, attend a class in which Steve Jobs and Einstein will be your teachers, take a photo in Andy's Warhol studio, land  the presidential airplane with Leo DiCaprio guidance, learn the process of how to make a wax figure and morph your face with one of your favourite celebrities in the beauty salon. Some of these activities will give you the possibility to send the end result to your email if you wish to do so.The 4th floor starts with a  walk on the red carpet. Prepare yourself for the clapping and paparazzi and to be greeted by Hallyu celebrities. After you indulge them in taking a selfie with you, keep walking. In no time you will find yourself surrounded by Hollywood stars from the Ocean's Thirteen, E.T. and  The Godfather among others. On the same floor you will meet Korea's greatest: King Sejong, Saimdang Shin (the first woman to appear in a Korean bank note), Admiral Sun Sin Yi, Yi Hwang and Yi IInventors such Einstein and Leonardo da Vinci and people who dedicated their life to peace and human rights such as Pope Francis, Ghandi and Nelson Mandela are also present.The 3rd floor is composed by world leaders, athletes and artists. It is also where you will be able to land the presidential aeroplane after you scan you ticket and discover the magic behind the wax figures creation, the ‚ÄúDiscovery Atelier‚Äù.The ‚ÄúDiscovery Atelier‚Äù is amazing. You will be able to see how those super detailed and life like figures were created. You can even follow the steps that were needed to create G-Dragon (Korea's music idol) wax figure to create your own 3D model throughout their activities. While there, you will learn that it takes months to create a wax figure, that they all have natural hair, eyes made of glass and that their teeth are created by a dental specialist. Some of the wax figures are dressed in clothes donated by their models from their own wardrobe. On the 2nd floor you will find famous actresses, world renowned fashionistas and the Hall of Fame, which is also the main hall of Grevin Museum and where you will find Psy, G-Dragon, Madonna, Michael Jackson, Mike Jagger to name a few.From then on you move to the recording studio where you will meet John Lennon, Luciano Pavarotti and Sumi Jo.The visit ends on a K-Drama set titled ‚ÄúHallyuwood‚Äùsurrounded by some of the most famous Hallyu actors and actress like Lee Min Ho, Park Shin Hye and Hyun Bin.If you have kids, do not worry. They will not be bored since they can interact with the wax figures and also participate in the activities. Mine loved the aeroplane simulator, the 3D creation of herself, to ride a bike alongside E.T., play a basketball game with Michael Jordan and try the quiz given by Steve Jobs and Einstein. Actually she loved everything. The problem was to leave the museum.Grevin Museum is open all year round. Has a gift shop and a Cafe.Its at walking distance from the City Hall if you are farther than that take the subway. The stop is Euljiro 1-ga, Exit 1 ( follow the sidewalk for about 3 minutes. The museum will be on your right side)Make sure you take your camera with you ready for action. Once you get in you will become a happy trigger kind of photographer.", August 2017
38,5.0,It was a good time:),"Frankly I've never been Myungdong before and had no idea where to go. However, I've been often told Grevin is one of the best wax museum out of Asia and was recommended by a good friend of mine who has already been there couple times. There were many figures of celerbrities and other public figures, such as Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. I loved how life-like those figures looked. It was so amazing I couldn't believe that some of them looked wayyy too real. It's worth the cost and fascinating to look at. I highly recommend this lovely wax museum to all of you!", November 2017

56,4.0,Interesting trip,"Was hoping for more wax figures of kpop and kdrama celebrities. When I visited alone, there were only 2 other visitors. During the initial phase of the visit, a staff was tasked to follow me around, supposedly to guide me on the rules, etc. However, at one point, when I turned around to look for her, she was nowhere found in sight - she had left without informing me, leaving me alone, surrounded by the wax figures; that really crept me out. It wasn't until a while later when I ran into the other 2 visitors when the ambiance became a lot more pleasant. But overall, it was interesting, and I was glad that I visited.", November 2017
57,4.0,Helicopter Employees...,"Employees kept following me around for almost the entire duration I spent there. It made it really awkward to take photos... If I moved to one side of the room, they slowly walked over, and if I looked at the employees, then they would casually glance elsewhere. Smh, I wasn't going to destroy their museum or take dirty photos. Just a foreigner trying to enjoy the museum like everyone else is. Employees are creepier than the wax figures.", October 2017
