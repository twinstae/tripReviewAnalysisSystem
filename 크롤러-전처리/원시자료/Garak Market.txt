4,5.0,Garak fish market,"Walking 1.5 kmâ€™s from hotel arrived initially at fruit market and a little further we came upon dried food market , fresh messy and then the fish market walked around for some 15 minutes and purchased some fish and still shelled  muscles etc. quality of food good as majority of fish slice and/or fresh. You can purchase these and then go upstairs and have them cooked.  Relatively cheaper than outside and you can see the fish prior to purchasing.  We arrived around 5.15pm on a Monday and it was relatively quiet", November 2018
