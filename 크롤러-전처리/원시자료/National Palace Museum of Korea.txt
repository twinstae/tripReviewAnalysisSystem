1,5.0,Great addition to a visit to Gyeongbokgung,This museum is in the grounds of Gyeonbokgung palace and is a great place to get a bit more understanding about the Joseon dynasties - especially if you didn't have guided tour of the palace. Just the right size to be interesting but not bombard you with too much information., September 2019
2,5.0,Informational,Entrance is free and there is audio guide that you can rent at the information desk. It is located within Gyeongbukgung but just outside the ticketing booth. Plenty of displays and descriptions depicting the lives of the royal families who lived in the palaces. Took us an hour to complete though we would love to stay longer., July 2019

6,5.0,All About the Royals,, June 2019
7,5.0,Wonderful exhibits regarding royal life,"The museum is medium sized compared to most museums I've visited, but that means it is extensive enough to peak your interest but manageable enough to complete in one morning/afternoon session. The exhibits range all the way back to the 1300s until 1910 when the Korean royalty was overthrown by the Japanese.", June 2019
8,5.0,Joseon Royalty ,, June 2019
9,4.0,Live experience ,The palace museum shows a large collection and explanations of different king dynasties and different royal belongings during the last centuries., March 2019
10,4.0,Visit during Lunar New Year,"Museum currently has an exhibit of things from Lichtenstein. While cool, it takes up most of the museum which leaves not a lot of information on Korean palaces. Overall, museum does a good job explaining what you are seeing and setting you up for Gyeongbokgung which is next door.", February 2019
11,4.0,Korean history,A good place to learn about Korean history. The museum displays a lot of relics from Joseon dynasty to the Korean empire time. I particularly enjoyed watching the documentary of how Gyeongbokgung was constructed. The documentary was shown next to a giant building plan of the palace., January 2019
12,1.0,Their service tho,"I was just going to write a good review on this museum but then I met the people on the information desk so I decided to give it a poor one. It’s a small museum but I think it’s quite informative. I found it quite enjoyable, especially since they have a Liechtenstein exhibition when I visited the museum. So after walking around for quite a bit, I found out that they have these stamps with palaces (special) logos on it that you can stamped in a stamp book provided by the museum. On the desk where these stamps are provided, there’s a piece of paper mentioning that we should ask the information desk for the stamp book (if we want to get one). So I walked happily to the information desk with the sign “English” in front of it, with a big smile on my face I said hello since the lady (she looked maybe like late 30ish-40ish) there seemed to ignoring me. I said hello and then asked her politely can I get the stamp book here, and she rudely just staring at me and grunted “hmph” and without saying anything just waving and pointing her fingers at a small table near the information desk. I don’t know why she acted that way, is it because I’m Asian? I was just so shocked to find such a behavior from a “professional”. I don’t get it. The gentleman who was on the front door greeting us and smiled at us when we first walked in, so I thought at first “oh wow they’re really friendly”. FYI, it’s not that rare to find locals here even though they’re working in a service area to be rude to people with a darker skin tone. When I first got here a few days ago, in the airport I was asking to some uncle about the tax form desk, and he also just grunted at me and waving /pointing his fingers around with some broken English “later later you can find it”and he didn’t look at me at all while saying this. It’s like I was some nuisance that he couldn’t wait to get rid off. Oh yeah, actually the lady also did the same way, she also didn’t look at me while she’s pointing the table to me. The funny thing was, when I walked passed the information desk later on, there’s a couple from Europe asking the same thing to her and she even got up from her chair, gladly went with them to show them where to find the stamp book, with a big smile on her face, being chatty and all. So what’s the deal? Smh.", January 2019
13,5.0,Entrance is hard to find but worth the effort,, August 2018
14,4.0,Rich Korean History,"This place is spacious and has many exhibits, great for anyone interested in the history of the country. As it is located at a side entrance of Gyeongbokgung, ie Gyeongbokgung Metro Station Exit 5, it is really convenient to visit.", November 2018
15,5.0,Fabulous small museum on Gyeongbokgung Palace grounds,"I highly recommend a short visit to this wonderful museum on Korean history on the Gyeongbokgung Palace grounds.  Most people opt not to visit the museum which is a shame.  There is no admission fee.  The museum can be easily covered in an hour or two.  If anything, the museum is a great place for a short rest and (clean) bathroom break after touring the palace grounds.  There is ample seating and the museum is very calm and peaceful.  It’s actually worth visiting on its own independently from the Palace IMO.", November 2018
16,4.0,A good museum to visit after seeing the palace.,"This museum is free and right next to the main palace. It is worth seeing because the palace is mostly empty. You can learn a lot about royal customs here including clothing, birth, marriage, etc... There are many displays including 2 rare cars that the Korean king and queen owned. This is not the best museum in Seoul but it is still very good and a must visit for anyone interested in learning about the Korean royal history. The gift shop has some good quality souvenirs in various price ranges. I rarely buy things at attractions but this one actually had some good ones that I bought for a reasonable price.", August 2018
17,5.0,A must see museum within the grounds of Gyeongbokgung Palace,3 stories museum with plenty of artifacts showcasing the history and culture of South Korea from infancy. You don't need a guide to explore this museum as they are well presented and laid for any one to enjoy and be informed/educated of the country's history. It is within the grounds of Gyeongbokgung Palace and is totally entrance free., August 2018
18,5.0,Definitely worth doing,We were surprised to see that this museum was free to visit. It contains a great deal of Korean history and culture. It also offers free Wifi for visitors and proved a godsend on a scorching day after doing the palaces., August 2018
19,4.0,Interesting,"Since I am a big fans of Korean Drama and also a history lover, visiting this national museum links me. I enjoyed very much. The museum provide a stamp book where you can put a stamp at the exit of each room. Exciting activities for my teens.", July 2018

22,5.0,Nostalgic Visit,, June 2018
23,5.0,Wonderful museum,"Fine museum focused on every aspect of life for Korean royalties, lots of interesting objects all displayed and explained clearly in multiple languages.  There’s a lot to see, and many did not make it to the lower floors where there is an amazing self-striking water clock. The information provided actually gives me a better understanding of the Gyeongbokgung palace than a cursory walk through the expansive palatial grounds.  This place is easy to miss given the large number of attractions in the area, but  worth a couple of hours for someone interested in learning more about imperial life in Korea.", June 2018
24,4.0,Excellent Museum ,, March 2018
25,5.0,Depository of History,, April 2017
26,5.0,Worth a visit whilst at the palace,"We thought we might as well look around here whilst visiting the palace and were happy we did. It’s a small museum but full of lovely things, the staff are so friendly there and seemed happy we had visited, 2 smiling ladies asked us to sign the guestbook and a security guard saw me stamping the rubber stamps in my journal, he came and found me as I was leaving and gave me a stamp booklet (you can get from the desk) filled out with all the stamps- it was just a very thoughtful thing to do", February 2018
27,2.0,The cafe is overpriced and has bad coffee,We visited gyeonbukgung palace and stopped in the cafe  here for a quick coffee. It's cozy & comfy inside but it took ages to make the coffee and it was luke warm when we finally got it. I wouldn't recommend it., December 2017
28,4.0,Excellent museum,, August 2017
29,4.0,Well worth a repeat visit,, October 2017
30,5.0,Free museum,"Although it's inside the palace grounds, this museum is completely free and you don't need to visit the palace to see the museum. Considering all the Seoul palaces are bereft of antiquities and treasures, the museum is the only place you can discover what treats there might have been inside once upon a time. As of October 2017, the lower floors were all closed and the upper floor was partially undergoing renovations, but the ground floor was open.", October 2017
31,3.0,A nice collection of royal seals.,"Visited the museum after checking out the Gyeongbokgung Palace. There were royal seals on display, a couple of royal cars etc. There were other royal regalia on display. It was alright, since I was there visiting the palace anyway.", October 2017
32,4.0,Free to Visit,We visited this museum first before entering Gyeongbokgung palace. Entry was free and there were some interesting exhibits. Good for a short visit but history buffs would probably stay longer. Easy to access., October 2016
33,4.0,"Nice, but not really special","What caught my eyes were royal cars displayed in the museum. Otherwise, other museums offer more. It is free, which is a bonus.", August 2017
34,4.0,Extensive Collection. Free Entrance,, July 2017
35,3.0,Complements the Gyeongbokgung Palace,"This museum perfectly complements the Gyeongbokgung Palace by showcasing many royal artifacts from the 27 kings of the Joseon Dynasty, including a GM car from the early 20th century. Similar to the National Folk Museum nearby, entrance to this museum is also free although its exhibits are not as enthralling as the National Folk Museum. Your knowledge of the Joseon Dynasty will be complete once you cover the Gyeongbokgung Palace as well as the 2 neighboring museums.", June 2017
36,5.0,"Big, comprehensive, free",, May 2017
37,4.0,Nice in combination with the palace ,"Admission is free so even if you don't like it, no harm no foul. The museum has some nice objects but nothing really spectacular, but you also get an insight into palace life and the sad short lived life of the Korean Empire. General descriptions are in English , items descriptions only give the name in English.", May 2017
38,5.0,Truly wonderful display,, May 2017
39,5.0,Palace closed so...........,We went here after arriving to visit the Palace on a Tuesday (when it was shut):). So we decided to go into the museum (which is free). We took advantage of the headphone facility in English for a small price and spent the afternoon here. So much to see and read about. So glad in the end that we did this before going to the palace the next week. Great gift shop and video viewing area. Well worth the visit. Allow a few hours if really wanting to get the most from it., April 2017
40,5.0,One of the best museums in Seoul!,, April 2017
41,4.0,Nice museum palace,The museum is located in and not far away from the city. The building is nice and many palace's stuffs here, April 2016
42,4.0,Brief overview of Korean Palace life,A visit to this museum will give one a brief overview of Korean Palace life. This a good place to visit before going around the palace grounds so one will have a feel of the substance of the palace and other structures., February 2017
43,4.0,Quite interesting & informative. Good enhancement to a palace visit. But few English descriptions. ,, February 2017
44,3.0,Free and by the palace,So many of the museums are much the same for the foreigner and this one was no different. There is some English but for many of the exhibits all you get was the name of the item in English which you could in most cases guess anyway. I found that after a bit that I just walked round with just a casual glance at things. It also wasn't well sign posted on where to go next. I didn't find anything new in this museum that I hadn't seen in others. Or when there was something different there was no English explanation of it, January 2017
45,5.0,Unmissable,"Please stop by the museum when you visit the 5 palaces, it is so worth visiting, especially to see the screen", December 2016
46,5.0,All about Joseon era,"Beautifully laid out in spacious halls, the history of the 500 years of Joseon rule is well featured here. Free admission, located just next to the main entrance to Gyeongbukgung, there is little to discourage anyone to visit. Worth the 0.5 to 1 hour visit together with the palace visit.", December 2016

48,4.0,Right next to Gyeongbok Palace,We're visiting the Gyeongbok Palace and the museum is right next to it.  A nice break from the heat and learn some Korean culture and history., July 2016
49,5.0,Best Museum in Seoul!!,"I stumbled upon this museum when visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace--in fact you enter through the gate to the Palace and the museum is on your right--hidden.  Free to enter and amazing exhibits. You can't miss the Korean Water clock, which defies description (it is two stories high).  The place was deserted on a Saturday. You could spend hours here. A real gem and would be my first recommendation for a museum in Seoul. If I only have time for one museum---it would be this one. Don't miss it!!", December 2016
50,5.0,Following the TV series Jang Yeong-sil.,"Yeps, one goal at our Seoul trip was to see things that Jang Yeong-sil build and invented (or is told to be invented). Anyway, waterclock replica was awesome but we did not find proper replica for celestial globe. Later found there is replica somewhere south from Seoul but not proper one in any of Seoul museums :) Epic.", March 2016

54,4.0,Spacious and well organised museum,"The National Palace Museum of Korea is located next to the Gyeongbokgung Palace. It is very easy to access via the subway Gyeongbokgung station. Lots of insight into the life of the kings and queens over 3 floors. From cars, paintings, musical instruments,royal seals etc it has artifacts from the palaces over the kingdoms. It is free but closed on Mondays. Gyeongbokgung palace is closed on Tuesdays to do take note. The restaurant serves decent but not fantastic food at reasonable prices.", August 2016

Plenty to do for little kids.  This is good for older, younger, dates, anybody.  Free entry.  Pricey gift shop. Awe inspiring air conditioning. Start on B1 and work your way up.", July 2016
57,4.0,Interesting place,"This little museum covers about 500 years of the Joseon dynasty's lifestyle and their contributions to art and literature. The old scrolls provide an interesting insight into the development of the Korean alphabets. The dynasty was known for its passion for record keeping through resident scribes and hence a lot of scrolls and record books. My host said that even after the Korean alphabet had considerably evolved, the scribes preferred to write in Japanese and Chinese as it was considered a symbol of high status and intellect to be conversant in these langauages. Also of interest are the arts and crafts on display and also the traditional clothing. Some foods have also been recreated for display. My host later pointed a dessert to me in a restaurant where we had lunch that the same dish was also part of the Royal menu displayed in the museum.", April 2016

69,4.0,Great museum,"My husband and I visited this museum on a Tuesday. As the palace and the folk museum (both next to the National Palace Museum) are closed on Tuesdays, it resulted in the very few people visiting this museum that day which suited us fine.  There's nothing worse than a crowded and noisy museum in my books.  We throughly enjoyed the exhibits, even though 2 of them were closed for renovations.   We also rented the audio guide for ₩1000 per set which gave interesting information.  There are also toilets and water coolers on every floor.", September 2015

72,5.0,Unmissable museum of royal history,"The National Palace Museum is secluded in a corner of the walled Gyeongbokgung Palace grounds and can be hard to find unless you are coming from the subway station. It should be near the top of all itineraries to Seoul, as its galleries contain the countless treasures of the Joseon dynasty and bring to life the fascinating history of the old rulers of Korea. The first gallery is the only one with comprehensive English information, but there is enough provided in the remaining rooms to put the awesome collection in context. Everything connected with royal life is on show: gold seals, clothing, official documents, paintings, musical instruments, a huge, working water-clock and vintage cars are just some of the awesome items on show. The National Palace Museum of Korea was more interesting than all of the actual palaces I visited in Seoul (except Changdeokgung) and is a truly magnificent museum.", June 2015

Once you've seen enough old buildings, you tend to run in and take a look and leave.  We were surprised to find the grounds had 2 great museums and a splendid cafe. This museum contains nearly 600 years worth of artifacts from the royal family and the Joseon era.  Basically they took the items that were in the various palaces and put them in this museum. It was very interesting to see the lifestyle of the Korean emperor.  The basement has a pair of royal limousines which are particularly awesome.  The museum has a cafe which serves a very tasty, high quality, if not cheap lunch.  It was very much woth it though, as the food was so good.  I really enjoy that most museums in Seoul are free.  When things are free, it's so much easier to take chances. As well, it promotes family time.  I saw more families going through galleries and museums in Seoul than I ever see at home.  Beware the gift shops, all of the museum souvenirs are either incredibly cheap and awful or so expensive it will take your breath away, with almost nothing in the middle range.", April 2011
