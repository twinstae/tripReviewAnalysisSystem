0,4.0,Good Experience,"Small, basic and less crowded casino. Limited table game & slot machine. Just nice & comfortable for spending a little time for slot game without noise disturbance whereby big casino have. Majority Asian tourist (especially from China). Good to visit and experience. ", April 2019
1,5.0,Had a great time ,"I have been avoiding the casinos in Seoul because of all the horrible reviews that i read on this and other travel sites.I was walking around the Coex last weekend and passed by this casino and outside there were horribly large queues of visiting asian foreigners brought here by the tour- bus loads. I asked one of the staff outside when was a good time to avoid such noisy crazy crowds. He told me ‘come mornings’.  So today (Saturday) i did exactly that. I arrived at 11am. There was nobody outside and the casino itself was 30% full (my estimate). Everyone from the entry clerk to the dealers and pit bosses were super friendly and super helpful, speaking excellent English. It took very little time to get acquainted with the minor variants in play (like the count down timer that determines when to shuffle the card shoe at the BJ tables. The minimum bet at the lowest buy-in BJ table was a respectable KWN 30,000, and there were plenty of open seats. I cannot understand how the reviews could be so far away from experience i had here. Maybe non-gamblers trying to trash the reputation ir maybe they arrived when the flood of wizzened elderly ladies (i’m 60+ so i can use that term without it being age discrimination) were bussed in. But go here at 11am on a Saturday and you will find a very pleasant experience with a friendly helpful english speaking staff.", April 2019
2,2.0,Small and basic,We didn't plan on going here but we're walking around downtown and came across it so we tried it out. The gaming floor is not very large. There is one section of table games and a small section of slot machines. I didn't go near the tables so I can't really rate them but I played a couple of slots without much action. I'd estimate there were about 50 machines. Anything under 1000 krw won't pay out at the machines so you can save slips and take them to the cage.There is a self service soft drink dispenser with the usual choices of sodas., October 2018
3,3.0,Expensive but ok,"After Reading all the bad reviews, I was scared to visit the casino. But I had a nice surprise when I got there. The casino had a nice entrance. And inside was clean and kinda big. I have seen much worse casinos so I was very glad ! They had free coffee and tea and juice. There s just one roulette table (with their own order of numbers which is very tricky when u are used to the same roulette numbers in general) and several blackjack and baccara. The minimum was 50000W which is high.  Over all you can spend a nice time gambling. The only major problem was like 90% were chinses people who were screaming and taking all the tables, so hard to find a free seat.", October 2018
4,1.0,Terrible casino and staff,"Worst casino and staff I have ever been to. Interesting that everyone at the front desk not only cant speak a word of english, but dont even try to explain things to you. I was given false information that caused alot of inconvenience for me.", March 2018
5,1.0,One of the worst casino’s ever.,"It’s the middle of winter and it’s like a sauna inside.  Very small, atmosphere is very tedious, and yes foreigners only.  We showed our passports to get in and walked out a few minutes later and told the lady who looked at our passport it was very hot and unbearable inside and as we continued walking out, instead of saying sorry or being professional we overheard her telling the male companions who also work with her at the entrance and she started laughing about situation. She is just a bad apple in a bunch because we have many Korean friends and understand the culture but this is what you should expect here.  He casino itself is like the size of a extra big basketball court, a very few slots on one end and the other 80-85 percent of the other end has table games.  If you really want to visit a casino go to walker hill very classy hotel with art inside casino on other.", February 2018
6,1.0,Worst place ever!,"The people there were so incredibly rude, and they do NOT offer free food and drink!  That is a flat out lie.  We had such a bad experience, we cancelled our memberships so we wouldn't receive offers or deals that would tempt us to return.  There is no going back after the awful time we had.  The overall atmosphere was that of desperate people and addicts, with a staff that was clearly just done and fed-up, didn't care at all about your needs or wants, and we NEVER got our drink orders in the 3 hours or so we were there, even though we asked multiple times.  I had more money to spend, but it just wasn't worth it!  This place is horrible.  You should go to Walkerhill Paradise Casino if you want good casino fun.  That place treats you like a VIP no matter who you are, and are always on top of their game.  Seven Luck was the worst casino and tourist experience I've ever had!  Stay away!", November 2017
7,5.0,Amazing Casino,Big Big casino with all level and types of gambling verities ....Its a neat and clean place with a good mix of people from all over the world...its attached to a hotel and you can stay there if you want, October 2016
8,4.0,First time to a casino in Seoul,First visit to Seven Luck Casino as I was spending half a day at Coex and Seven Luck Casino was just next door to Coex., February 2017
9,2.0,A very small casino,Location is not convenience and the casino itself is very small and not new at all. If you live in the hotel right next to it then it's not a bad idea to have a bet over there. My kid was left outside in the game room and wait us., December 2016
10,2.0,Advice from an American Gambler,"As an avid world gamer from California, I would skip this casino if you are looking for anything that resembles Las Vegas or Macau. It's not a high end place like Monte Carlo in the South of France region either. For a CA native, it would be closest to a whole in the wall Indian Casino that is bursting at the seems with Mainland China gamblers who are pushy and lack common western concepts of personal space. Baccarat tables had a minimum of 10,000W with the only free space at Texas Hold em tables with 200,000W minimum bets per hand at 11pm.Stereotypical customer service with a foreigner only admitted policy. You must show your foreign passport at the door, with a very unfriendly feel from the entrance. You have to take an escalator to the 2nd floor to view an electronic dealer version of roulette, black jack with high minimums, and Baccarat with no house commissions as a slight plus.Overall, not worth a visit unless you are with a group of friends with money burning a hole in your pockets. I would recommend a trip to Las Vegas or Macau for some real gaming atmospheres.", October 2016
11,1.0,Don't waste your time,"People go to casinos to have fun and to spend a few hours of time. This place is really small and you will not feel welcome. Only a couple of tables were open. The tables with low minimum bets (less than 50000 won) were full. Over half of the tables were Baccarat tables. There were only a couple of slot machines that are somewhat understandable from a Western perspective. There is no bar and the dining area (4-5 tables) doesn't offer any drinks: you have to sit at the game table to order them! It was also VERY hot already before lunch time. Only positive side of this place is that there is no entrance fee, so you can leave soon without feeling too bad.", March 2016
12,2.0,No attraction to the gambling tables...,"I was staying in the Continental Hotel, which is linked with this casino, so it was easy to pass by. I only stayed for 15 mins though as there was no attraction to the gambling tables. I would have liked to poker, but only two tables were open and I didn't really feel welcome. Also the other tables were not really international so I decided to spend my money somewhere else...", November 2015
13,3.0,Average casino,This was an average casino. We only came across it because we were walking from COEX mall to the intercontinental COEX. Worth going in to look around., February 2016
14,3.0,Boring,"The casino is not so big. Mostly are table/card games. The slot games were boring as they were old games. No new machine. Luckily, I won approx. US$600 at the Hot shot slot machine after playing for less than 15mins. The games were paid in KRW. The other gamblers looked at me with angry eyes because I heard they complained to their friends that they lost their money on the same machine after sitting there for hours.", November 2015
15,1.0,"Cold, dull, boring and poor service","I have been to many casinos around the world and this easily stands out as the worst one by a mile.The place is tiny and more importantly, all the staff were cold, unfriendly and some were even down right rude. This place strictly prohibits any celebration amongst the players after one good hand of blackjack. Players who celebrated with noise after one good hand will be warned by the staff. I wonder what sort of casino is this.The slots were mostly outdated and the payoffs are a total ripoff. I had seen similar slots in other casinos like Singapore and Macau, the payoffs are so much better. Avoid the slots at all cost!Another ripoff is Blackjack. They use 6 decks and these are shuffled using an auto shuffle machine. While I did not play Blackjack there, I simply do not understand how on earth the dealer kept getting Blackjack and 21 points so many times during the one hour which I was watching as there was no available seat for me. On hindsight, I was lucky not to get a seat as during that one hour or so, the dealer got more blackjack and 21 points than all the players combined!!! And this happened in both the tables which I was watching!. The service is virtually non-existence for anything. In my opinion, I really wonder why those Chinese tourists would like to subject themselves to such poor service. This casino should just close down for good.", November 2015
16,3.0,Bring your Passport - Gangnam Gambling,"Was walking around Coex shopping center and came across this casino. I am from Las Vegas, so I just wanted to check things out to see how it compares. Most of the table games are blackjack or baccarat. There are some slots machines but not many. No video poker. Didn't see any live poker games going. But I was there at 10:00am in the morning. If you are looking for the Las Vegas ""glitz and glam"" then this isn't the place. This place is for hard core gamblers. Tip - You need your passport to get in.", October 2015
17,1.0,Bad service ,First time I found casino they have a bad service.If you want spend time make it last choice Casino paradise batter than this casino, June 2015
18,4.0,Good blackjack rules make it worth the wait for a table.,"Personnel were not exactly friendly but polite enough. The casino is small on the inside with only about 5 tables open (in late afternoon when I went) for blackjack. (an equal or greater # for baccarat). Only two tables were  at the 10K won -- roughly $10 minimum -- bet which is my speed (others at 50K won or higher). I waited at least 15 minute to get a seat. 6-deck shoe but the rules were the best I've ever experienced: dealer stands on 17, double-down on any initial hand, and ... surrender on an initial hand. I would definitely go back again.", April 2015
19,1.0,Don't bother unless you seek Chinese or Korean,"I visited last week because I was staying at the Intercontinental Coex in the same building so I didn't even have to go outside and I had a free chip to use. But what a horrible experience! The staff didn't say anything, no smiles or greetings or please stay awhile. I couldn't wait to get out. I won't go again.", November 2014
20,2.0,Not too swooft,"I got pumped up coming to Seoul to see this place, because I wanted to play Texas Hold'em after being in Japan where there are no casinos.  My hotel was pretty close, took the modern subway a couple of stops and walked to the opening.  The COEX complex is a big office/mall complex, and is pretty nice with a food court and all, and the casino is right next door.  I walked into what looked like a massive casino on the outside, and it was tiny inside.  About 3 tables playing baccarat and roulette, and the Texas hold'em area was empty. I asked where the people were, and the dealer said, ""Maybe sometime, do you want to leave your phone number?""  Wow.  Then I saw this game going with a few people called Caribbean Style Poker, where everyone gets three cards, including the dealer. You bet on whether your hand of three will beat the dealer's three cards.  Sounds good, but you have to ante $30 each time, and bet another $30 if you want your cards to play.  Needless to say, I dropped $60 bucks and saw the writing on the wall immediately. Thirty dollar ante? That's like if you were playing a 2-5 limit game and you bet 6 times the big blind EVERY hand, no matter how bad it was. You would go broke in 5 minutes with the minimum $300 buy in.  So, I won't rag on this place any more, just suffice it to say that you should stay home and save your money.", July 2014
21,1.0,poor service,"Manager song yong bum and staff hong snae was exceptionally rude to hotel guests at Oakwood Premier.  Will never stay at Oakwood premier again and do not recommend spending $$ at the seven luck casino.  Was denied entrance to casino because staff took it upon themselves to deny entrance because we looked like we were ""drunk"".  Obviously not the case since I was able to post this review right after being denied entrance.  It seems as if you do not speak Korean you are treated with poor service and rude staff. I recommend you should not stay at this hotel or waste your money at this casino.  Park Hyatt would be my suggestion.  Great brunch and high regards for service.", March 2014
22,1.0,Their best is still not good enoug,The  staff cant even manage a fake smile to a guest. Very monotonous  tone (even if you excuse their English skills). Dealers are just robots with bones and muscles. Interior was just average and there were not enough tables for people to play. I am sure they can see there are people waiting to play while they are just looking at other people playing at a table., September 2013
23,5.0,Clean with Great Service,"I went to Lucky Seven after visiting Macau and I was shocked at the level of professionalism provided by the staff at Seven Luck.  I definitely recommend the casino, but please note that it is a rather small facility and so finding a table can be very hard with the right limits (unless you're a high limits player).", March 2013
24,1.0,First casino experience-was awful,Never been to a casino before-so decided to have a look. What an unfriendly place- from people on reception to member of staff who told me off for asking for a beer ( I thought they gave out drinks in these places) I really only wanted to play roulette as I understand that- there was no room and there was a huge row with a punter- she was carted off by security.Played a few slot machines and lost a few dollars- was the most depressing place- mostly Chinese who seemed deadly serious on their cards. Hopefully might get to Vegas one day?, January 2013
25,3.0,Not as good the other branch,"After I have been to other branch in Seoul,  the Gangnam seems to be too dark inside.I also agree that the location is not easy to find.However I still like the slow going casino feel, this is good for small punter like me.", October 2012
26,1.0,Horrible Casino,"This place was awful from start to finish. It was extremely hard to find, and no one working at the stores in the vicinty seemed to know where it was. It's way out from the city center, not worth trekking out there for. Once inside, there are hardly any tables. Most of them are BlackJack. The minimums at the tables are ridiculous, as another reviewer put it, they are a rip-off. I went to play roulette. Two tables shared a wheel. The turns between each bet where about 2-3x longer than at casinos in the States. Furthermore, there were only four tables being run, even though they could have had six. And there were dozens of people standing around waiting to get a seat at one. When I asked if they would open another table, they very rudely told me no. Also, I was not once offered a drink. Even though they said that servers would be walking around taking drink orders. Overall, a very horrible experience. And I had been really looking forward to do a bit of gambling since I live in Japan and it's illegal.", October 2012
27,1.0,Stay avay of Black Jack tables - rip off,"In addition to previous comments about being dark and fun-less we've experinsed the real fraud.They use spesial dealing machines for Black Jack - you don't see card deck there like in LV. Instead they are all inside the machine and are shaffled there too, and the machine shaffles them in favor of casino.We've spent 2 hrs there, and calculated that 5 players together had less BJs than the dealer alone. Also there were VERY few busts for dealer, and every 2nd time he had 18-20 right away.All 5 of us knew how to play BJ properly, but none were able to get above our initial amount. Never seen anything like this. Stay away.", September 2012
28,1.0,"Smoky,run down and campy, avoid it!",This has seen better days. I do not recommend this unless you are really desperate to lose money in a smoky run down campy casino that would be closed in hours on the Vegas strip., May 2012
