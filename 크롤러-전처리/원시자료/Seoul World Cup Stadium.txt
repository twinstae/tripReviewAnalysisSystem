0,4.0,Stadium tour was exactly as advertized!,"I have been to dozens of games here, both the national team and FC Seoul, and there is not a bad seat in the place--and on game days, the north end crowd is rockin' it!  I finally took the stadium tour and found it to be as advertised, and expected--it costs 1000W (about $1 US)", January 2020
1,4.0,Sport!!,It was a stadium as all the others but the people made the diffrent. Everyone was nice and friendly and took care of there dirt., October 2018
2,5.0,"Good times, average footy!",, March 2019
3,3.0,Large stadium but soulless ,, November 2018
4,5.0,Great for football fan!,, September 2018
5,5.0,2002 World Cup Stadium,"I have been here first time for Turkey vs China football match for World Cup 2002 in Republic of Korea. Turkey : 3 - China: 0   It is a great stadium, convenient transportation and easy watching stadium.", May 2018
6,4.0,Faentasuim,Very interesting place to visit especially Faentasium has interesting stuff that if you're a fan of football you gonna enjoy it, October 2017
7,3.0,Great stadium but terrible team,"The massive majestic world cup stadium is impressive and fit for purpose for this day and age for major football matches, concerts, etc. However if you are planning to watch FC Seoul then I would probably tell you to support the away team. The stadium is rarely full to capacity which is surprising considering the population in Seoul, but the worst thing apart from the team is the supporters. I hate vuvuzelas ever since they where introduced to the football world at the South African World Cup, but also the FC Seoul fans don't seem very interested spending a lot of time on their phones and also they have a cheerleader stand where the fan seats are. Not the kind of things i enjoy at a football match but they do have a very nice fan cafe and shop and the food and drink is very good including the massive pizzas you can get and the beer. The world cup stadium is also very easy to get to using the subway as there is a subway station named after it. Overall it's good to experience it but I wouldn't want to be a FC Seoul fan.", May 2018
8,4.0,Nice stadium. Great food centre.,It's a nice stadium. With a massive super market underneath.  Really good food centre big cheap meals with a massive choice. Very slightly tricky to order. Best to look at pictures in menu/food catalogues.   choose pay at till. Get receipt wait for your number  on screen and go to numbered counter. You won't be disappointed with price and quality. After stadium we followed small river to main river and naval museum. Many riverside parks along the way. Then you can view the national assembly  on the other riverbank and head up to hapjeong station, April 2018
9,4.0,Superb stadium,, August 2017
10,5.0,Expect the unexpected,It was breath-taking when I finally saw this monument. It really stands out and so many activities going on at once. Its not just for soccer/football lovers., June 2017
11,4.0,Great atmosphere ,"We went to watch FC Seoul play a night match as my son is a soccer fan. We all had an amazing time despite a light shower. The fan support was full on for the home team, even with maybe a fifth of the stadium full. Have not experienced the passion before in this size crowd. Food options outside before the game were great as well. An all round fun night.", June 2017
12,5.0,Been there a million times ,"I like this place because its near our house and there are so many different things to do there. Food, shopping, movies, and soccer matches are all fun activities. Surely a must see when you are here", June 2017
13,3.0,Nice place to walking with a family,"I came here because I want to go to Haneul Park and I need to across this stadium to get there. The stadium is really huge but the time that I came, nothing much here.", November 2016
14,4.0,Chill Like A Local,, October 2016
15,2.0,Pretty dirty around there.,"I went to an FC Seoul game and the lower bowl was almost full. The pain is that this stadium is sectioned off and you can only enter you specific area.  The other thing I did not like was the food, as there was only 1 tiny gs25 convenience location in our section.", March 2017
16,3.0,Went to the stadium at wrong timing,"We went to the stadium at night and the match was between FC Seoul and Jeonnam Dragons. The guard requested us to pay for the tickets when the match was left with just 8 mins. We ended up talking photo outside the stadium and left soon in order to avoid the 50,000 crowds. A good stadium for photography", November 2016
17,5.0,Visit to World Cup stadium ,There was a gate left open as we walked round so did our own tour. Security was really loose. We even got onto the pitch, November 2016
18,4.0,Cheap stadium visit,, September 2016
19,5.0,Soccer in Seoul,"Nice stadium. I went for a Seoul-Incheon game. VIP at the booth was just 35,000 KRW with free beer and popcorn during the game. Fans were very passionate. Good experience", April 2016
20,4.0,Pleasant outing and easy to get to,, June 2016
21,3.0,Nothing special!,This was the venue for the 2002 Korea-Japan World Cup. There was nothing on when we visited and the museum was empty and interactive videos were not available. The stadium is certainly well cared for and very clean but it was not really worth visiting., March 2016
22,3.0,A worn out place that once was great,"The stadium itself is a nice place, but it feels like the place is stuck in 2002 World Cup glory and the time just stops there. The whole stadium is clean due to the Korean standard of hygiene, but there are only few visitors. The museum is empty, the interactive videos and games were shut down. Perhaps it would be a different story if I come when there is a sporting event held there.", December 2015
23,3.0,FC Seoul and AFC Champions league football,"Went there during the week at night to watch FC Seoul in a AFC champions League game. Ticket prices are very reasonable as my friend and I only paid $12.00 USD (14,000 Won) and we sat very close to the pitch. Lines are long to get food or beer but plenty of vendors and restrooms. Make sure not to walk into the World Cup mall when looking for the entrance to buy tickets. Use stairs not the rotunda.", April 2016
24,4.0,FC Seoul ale ale..,, June 2015
25,4.0,Museum and tour review,"There were no matches on as I went in the middle of winter meaning a lot of the area was closed. The videos were not playing in the museum and I was pretty much the only person there. However, the opportunity to see such a stadium and read about the history for the small price (about 50p, GBP) was massively worth it. I got to stand in the stadium completely alone looking at the pitch and stands, which for a football nerd like me was a beautiful experience. I also got to see the changing rooms, press rooms and the non interactive parts of the museum. Overall well worth a visit, and either in summer for the exhibits or winter for the serene experience.", January 2016
26,3.0,"Worth visiting, but K-League was not that fun",, April 2015
27,5.0,A sight right next to our house ,, January 2016
28,2.0,Does it Worth Visiting?,"We thought it was a good idea to explore the famous World Cup Stadium while we are in Seoul. The stadium is very accessible via the World Cup Stadium subway station. There is not much to see, however. In such a stadium, you may expect to see a small shop that sells relevant souvenir items. It does not exist here. Instead there is a large department store / supermarket that sell everything and I guess that why people come here.", October 2015
29,3.0,It's ok,, December 2015
30,3.0,Meh,Over it was cool that Japan and Korea co hosted the World Cup in 2002 the stadium itself is outdated or old nothing special. The basketball courts near the stadium and the homeless and restaurants are nearby so that's convenient!@@!, November 2015
31,4.0,It was where World Cup was held in 2002,We passed by Seoul World Cup Stadium on our way to Sky Park and the Stadium was big and it was where World Cup was held in 2002., October 2015
32,4.0,A must see for football nuts,"If you are a football nut like myself, a visit is worthwhile. Easy acces from the metro which stops just at the doorsteps.", August 2015
33,4.0,Nice Facility,"I watched as VIP, and the facility was great. Seoul Stadium has excellent public transportation system too. It has museum, and you can visit it too.", January 2015
34,4.0,Cool to see,"If you are a sports / soccer lover, the World Cup if a cool spot to see.  It is easy to get to from the subway.", January 2015
35,5.0,Great cheap and worthwhile adventure,, July 2015
36,4.0,Great Soccer History,, July 2014
37,3.0,checked it out from outside,"We walked a flight of stairs to check out the stadium from outside, nothing much to see. Theres sports shops in the stadium which u can go in. Thats all", June 2014
38,4.0,a good outlet mall in the stadium,We found a very good outlet mall in the stadium. It was a useful place to buy what you want. I recommend you to visit there and find whatever you need., March 2015
39,4.0,A great facility and a good team.,"Enjoyed the excellent stadium and the location. The football was good, and the work rate of a Korean team is phenomenal. Seoul FC make an interesting team, but I sometimes feel as though the crowd response is a little too orchestrated....but this is a Confucian society.", February 2014
40,5.0,my fav place in seoul,, December 2013
41,4.0,Seoul FC,We went to Seoul World Cup Stadium using subway from Osan. It takes around 1:40 hour but I it was nice to see that stadium built for 2002 World Cup that Brazil won., September 2014
42,4.0,Not really a tourist attraction but nice and well-maintained,"I feel soccer fans would have a better appreciation for this stadium. Although not necessarily a tourist attraction, it is nice to see and go watch a game. Well maintained with easy access from subway.  Has a CGV movie theater, a Homeplus shopping center, and a KFC. Situated nicely around mountains as well.", October 2014
43,3.0,A Stadium with Sentimental Value,"As i heard from the tourist guide, this Stadium are meant so much to the Koreans. This where the place they have their proud of becoming the host for World Cup and where they beat their rival off. During my visit this stadium are empty. Not much visitors only a few guard, maybe because it still in the morning. Walk around the museums, taking picture with the keepers and go to the souvenir shop. Most of the souvenir you can get from anywhere, hehe.", October 2013
44,5.0,Seoul World Cup Stadium - Something for Everyone,, June 2014
45,3.0,"Big, well maintained","Part of this stadium complex was some kind of shopping mall and cinema. So, a lot of locals still go there during the weekends and holiday. The entrance to that stadium was affordable. There is nothing much anyway inside of course (its just a stadium), just to snap some pictures. The exhibition room was indeed very informative and inspiring. I truly enjoyed the exhibition room.", July 2013
46,4.0,Border Bash,, July 2013
47,3.0,Mostly just big,"This is probably more interesting if you are a big soccer fan, but just looking at a big stadium does not hold a lot of appeal for me.  Mostly it is just an empty place with lots of seats.", October 2012
48,5.0,Great stadium to watch a game,"I checked out an F.C. Seoul game here on a chilly, rainy Saturday afternoon in April.  Had a great time.  The sightlines are flawless and the fans made a surprising amount of noise given how few of them there were (only 10,000).  Tickets are super-cheap (about $10) relative to Europe and it's a safe place to take children who like the sport.  Super convenient access with a subway station directly outside the gate.", April 2013
49,4.0,Cant get over they dont use it all the time,"Had a tour here and thought great stadium, was told they never use it much now which is a shame, would have loved to been here to watch a game", July 2012
50,4.0,Spectacular view.,First the stadium is spacious enough and there is state of the art equipment favourable for any event. It is also a beautiful edifice., May 2012
51,4.0,How many world cup stadiums have you been before?,, February 2013
52,5.0,Great Stadium,So we visited the Seoul World Cup Stadium as it was only about 2 miles from Hongdae where we were staying. The stadium itself was closed unfortunately as was the fan shop for FC Seoul. THere was however an IMAX cinema underneath the stadium where we went and watched Skyfall for around 8000 won each., November 2012
53,5.0,Ooo Ooo Ooo FC SEOUL!,"Forget watching baseball, come cheer on FC Seoul in the Ultras' section. With only 10,000 won it's a great way to spend a Sunday!", June 2012
54,5.0,FC Seoul Matches,"I come here pretty often for the FC Seoul football matches.  It's an excellent venue for soccer matches.  If you're coming for premium food, then forget it.... but that the fact that you're allowed to bring your own food, beverages, and alcohol MORE THAN makes up for it.... in fact,,,,, I think this in the very reason I enjoy this venue.", June 2012
55,5.0,Interesting,Interesting place for a visit. You get to go into the locker rooms etc etc., September 2011
56,3.0,One tenth of my expectations,, February 2012
57,5.0,"Magnificent stadium, magnificent views","The stadium itself is fantastic - I can't wait to go there for a match. Next to it is a large hill with a zigzag wooden staircase up. Climb up for great views of the stadium, river, and city and marvel at the fact that it used to be a landfill site...", April 2011
