9,4.0,Beautiful and authentic,"If it is an active and continually used Buddhist temple, I would say it's authentic.  To that end, photography is not allowed inside but outside the building and the grounds are gorgeous.  Animal shaped shrubs and flowering plants along well groomed paths invite visitors into a peaceful environment within the confines of a bustling downtown.  Take special note of the swastika at the top of one of the temples.  Obviously, it has a different meaning than what we are used to.  Still, it invokes in me a strange feeling to see that symbol so prominently displayed.  30 minutes is enough.  And as there is no admission fee, it is one of the few places left that tourists can go visit for free.  4 stars.", November 2019

Our guide Kasey was very accommodating/ and patient while each member of my family made their private wishes while rubbing the famous Pagoda tree n taking pics. It was surprising to find this temple so close to the big city not to mention to lotus garden. This temple was the precursor to  our other temple visits.

43,3.0,"Beautiful, but confusing without a guide","We visited on a Monday, when the museum is closed. The temple is worth seeing, and it's in central Seoul near the main palace and the US Embassy. But without a guide, it was hard to understand what was what between the different buildings. It was hard to find a pamphlet in English (though there is a pavilion we eventually found that had a little brochure in English).

You'll find yourself staring up there, unable to stop yourself. The temples are beautifully painted and decorated. A must-see in the Insadong area. However, be respectful. We went on a Sunday morning and it was filled with local worshipers. Please treat their beliefs and ceremonies with respect and do not try to pose in front of their statues as they're trying to pray (which we saw on more than one occasion in our brief time there) Also, refrain from entering the main temple as a ceremony is going on.

I don't think I'd go out of my way to visit, but then I have seen a lot of temples in Asia in the past. I suggest leaving your shoes at the door and going inside to experience the tranquility and ambience. For Buddhists this would be a must-visit. The three Buddhas are quite stunning. No photography inside is allowed.", May 2019
56,4.0,Colorful,"There were numerous lanterns handing with papers from them. It is a small temple grounds but still has much to offer. They still had prayer areas, theater, shop, cafeteria, and a few other things. Like many other reviewers, I have been to larger temples but do not compare temples due to size.

But, if you go, please be mindful that people are actively praying all around you, not just inside/in-front-of the main temple.  It is a colorful and joyful place.  At first, some of the figures in the garden made me feel like a child.  I expected to run into Hello Kitty or somewhere.  I didn't read up in advance about it so I missed appreciating in the moment what it all meant.  Regardless, it is interesting both from a cultural standpoint for a non-believer visitor, and though from another faith, I certainly appreciated that this place is very special to many.

123,3.0,Nice temple to visit in the city centre ,Jogyesa is not as beautiful as Bongeunsa or other temples we have seen in SK but it's perhaps the most accessible - a short walk from Insadong. There was scaffolding around the main building when we visited the first time but it was removed when we walked past at the end of the trip. An oasis of calm in the frenetic city. There is an impressive pagoda in the courtyard and the Buddha statues in the prayer hall are pretty stunning. Worth a visit if in the area., July 2018

There was a bus stop just outside so the site is easy to get to., May 2018

Maybe it would be time better spent during the warmer months.", March 2018
152,4.0,Jogye Buddhist Sect Headquarters,"This temple is the headquarters of one of the major Buddhist sects in Korea. My experience with temples of this sect is they are highly commercialized.

I'll never forget this experience.  I've seen many Buddhist temples in different countries, but this one so resonated with me.  Such spirit it has.  Visit the gift shop too for some wonderful items.

The grounds were a nice oasis in the middle of the city, but was not exactly peaceful due to the crowds. Our group scheduled time to speak with a monk for a tea ceremony and a short lesson on mediation which was nice. We also ate lunch across the street, served buffet style, which was the best vegetarian meal I have ever had. The meal was a diverse combination of flavors and used ingredients like black sesame pastes that I have never tasted in vegetarian meals. I was overall very impressed with the whole visit and would recommend it to anyone visiting Seoul.", October 2017

Jogyesa is relatively new, but has become important for Buddhism in modern Korea. It has been the site of political protests, and important religious work.

The place comprised of the temple itself plus what seemed to be a separate building for study on the ground floor (with the 2nd floor being inaccessible).
