2,3.0,worth a visit if you like pink,"This place if for those who love makeup and everything pink. It has 5 floors i think, the first one had tons of makeup, other floors had clothes, a laundry shop and a cafe. It was cute, but not a must visit.", June 2019
3,4.0,Fun concept store,"It is a rather famous flagship store in the middle of Myeongdong, where you are overwhelmed with pink, clothes and 3CE make up. I suggest going when it opens to avoid a very busy store and also take your time at the Instagram worthy spots.", June 2019

7,5.0,Awesome Pink,went straight up to the cafe where they serves fanciful drinks with candy floss! Great to have candy floss that wont melt during the winter. Great texture. Drinks was ok. Due to the snow the outdoor sitting area was closed. We had to stay indoor. However staff attitude needs to be improved!, December 2018
8,3.0,Went to the one in Myeongdong,"Went to the one in Myeongdong, it was super crowded on the ground floor, but it was actually quite empty on the other floors (which sells the same cosmetics). Top floor was the rooftop area, not exactly clean, the pink and white pillows were kinda turning grey and no one was taking care of the finished drinks from previous customers. Blue cream soda was good tho.", September 2018
9,5.0,LOVE THE PINKY SUMMER VIBES!,"I went to this cafe accidentally since I was looking for makeup stuffs on the lower floor. Didn’t expect to be so “hotel-look” and “fancy”, I totally feel satisfied with the photos and moment I got there. Come at summer will be a lot better! There is also pool inside that you can take a photo with! 💕", August 2018
10,1.0,Left the store with bad feelings. Cute interior doesn’t help,"We are very looking forward to visiting their shop since we are a big fan from Thailand. The store is very cute, well decorated with vintage pink hotel atmosphere. Sadly we got a bad service from the staff both at Stylenanda fashion and 3ce counter. The 3ce cashier put all the cosmetic in the bag carelessly that she accidentally dropped the cheek power that we are going to buy, she looked at it suddenly she just put it back. I asked for a new one and the answer is “it isn’t broken” check it! No sorry nothing... Such a disappointment. They decorate their shop so lovely that they may forget that SERVICE is also important.", August 2018

22,4.0,"Pink, my new Black","Love this boutique shop that has very creatively designed each floor in a hotel concept, from lobby entrance, room floors, washroom, laundry, swimming pool cafe, & on the rooftop an open air area where you can sit and take pictures.  Their merchandise ranging from cosmetics, toiletries to fashionable clothes, jeans are all placed on each floor & blends well with that particular concept of that floor.  Walls are largely PINK with the staircase painted in a vibrant orange color nicely illuminated by the lightings.", April 2017

24,4.0,Pink Everything!,Cool place to take photos with girlfriends. There is a outdoor rooftop that is probably great to chill at during the summer but since we were there when it was -7C we only spent a minute there. Top floor cafe offers colored cotton candy drinks that were fun to drink with friends., January 2017
