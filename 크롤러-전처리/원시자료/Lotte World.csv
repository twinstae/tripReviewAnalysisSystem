4,4.0,Family fun day,"Whilst at the beginning I thought it was a little pricey, the number of rides available to all and short wait time made it worthwhile. Only downside was the lack of English speaking guides within the park which made it a little difficult to get around. Other than that we had a great time", February 2020
5,4.0,To the Magic Island for more challenging experiences,"we went there during our winter holiday, and found out that during winter some of the outdoor rides was closed. then we spend half day inside the lotte world but it was too packed, most of the rides have around 40 minutes waiting line. but its worth the fun, our 6 years old daughter was have some fun on the park. TIPS: install the Lotte World Adventure apps on your mobile phone, to get more info on the queue line and you also can book the ride as well.", December 2019

Lotte World Tower contains everything that is necessary for modern urban living.", January 2020
7,4.0,Largest indoor theme park,"We travelled in winter, therefore chose Lotte over Everland and it didn't disappoint. As any theme park, there are many attraction, rides etc. It's connected to an outdoor amusement park called Magic Island and the theme park itself is connect to a shopping mall that features theaters, sports facilities etc. It's closer to the city and can be reached easily by public transport", December 2019
8,3.0,The heat is on...,OMG if you are a 50+ woman or a warm blooded man you are in for a hot night!The temperature of this hotel is 28 degrees and you cannot get the air conditioning to work as it does not switch on in winter. When we told the staff that we thought the air con was broken they checked it and it could not be lowered! We were kindly given a fan! It was not a silent fan but then again either am I!!, January 2020

11,3.0,Lotte World,"Avoid going during public holidays, school holidays and weekends. The queues are so long. It takes 1 hour to queue for any ride. The plus side is that its cheap entry tickets.", December 2019
12,4.0,Internal and external amusement park,My 2 teens asked to visit an amusement park. Wanted to visit Everland but was quite a distance.  Decided to visit some place nearer to our hotel. Took a cab there and thought that the driver had sent us to the wrong place as we are not aware that the entrance is at the basement. Unlike Disneyland. Went in and there was a long queue to purchase the tickets. There were many students. Luckily the queue proceeded smoothly and fast. Bought the tickets to the park and folk museum. Did not go to the museum so we wasted on that. Spent about 3 hours as there weren‚Äôt many rides that appealed to my teens. We bought the so called fastpass in the park so my teens need not queue up. The place was alright but not as good as Disneyland. Need a bit of refurbishment though., December 2019
13,5.0,Amassing Amusement Park Indoor and Outdoor ü•∞ü•∞,A great place to spend time with your kids whom will love the adventure and thrilling of rides everywhere. It is similar to Disney Land & combination of Universal Studio but only Korean Style. Many amusement park indoor and outdoor were pack with teenagers and even children‚Äôs in all walks of age. Lovely to see explore and have fun to feel how it is it to be like kid again. üíïüíïüíï, December 2019
14,1.0,Even if you get FREE tickets DO NOT GO,"Visited with my three kids. More crowded than Hong Kong‚Äôs MTR Subway during peak hour. Unreal.  They should have a concept of crowd control. Too many people no exaggeration. A basic swing ride took a wait of 1 hour 40 mins (quoted a 1 hour wait which was already unreasonable for the ride) - 3 minute ride. Will never visit ever again even if I was paidIf they employed a maximum occupancy limit, it would have been a fun day for the kids. Instead wasted one out of five of our days in Seoul. Will be disputing my credit card charge for this one to say the least. Left after the one and only ride.", December 2019
15,1.0,Not worth your time,"Average wait time per ride is 90-120mins, even on weekday. Completely overhyped and overpriced. Unless you come in via Seoul Discovery Pass. You will be lucky to hop onto 3 rides for the entire journey.Go to Everland unless you like queuing up.", December 2019
16,1.0,Not that ‚Äúwow‚Äù after a while,"Not that ‚Äúwow‚Äù like I expectedPark was not as good as we expected. I was excited at first during the entrance but was greeted with disappointment after a while. The queues for all rides is too long. I waited 120 mins for the hot air balloon which is not that cool after all. While queuing, you can listen to a speaker kept repeating the same sentence on and on in Korean language which makes us very annoying, more like chanting until we found out is actually a greet and bye from the staff when u get down from the rides. No merchandise items were sold inside which double the disappointment for me and my sister. Those plan to visit Korea, this place not an ideal but you can try if u want too. Something similar with Genting Highlands.", December 2019
17,2.0,Big shopping with indoor entertainment ,"It‚Äôs a big shopping centre, with lots of entertainments like kids. There‚Äôs really not much shopping. Mostly games & food. It‚Äôs not a place for us.", December 2019
18,4.0,Biggest indoor amusement park,"The park is divided into outdoor and indoor. Outdoor features some of the most thrilling rides and coupled with a few kiddy rides. The castle is one of the prominent display outdoor that you will take picture with. Recommended to buy fast passes as most rides have very long waiting time. There are also plenty of Restaurants inside the park. For very young toddlers, they do have a designated indoor areas for them too.", December 2019
19,3.0,Theme park during winter @ Korea,"Had fun but park was not as good like we imagine. Kids section is fun for kids age from 2 to 7yrs old. My child got bored after awhile. Poor in general is old, makes me thing of the theme park in Genting Highland.", December 2019
20,2.0,Nothing really charming about this park,"So we decided to book a ticket to lotte world during our vacation to Seoul, but I was really disappointed about the park. Having been to Disneylands, I would say lotte world is not even close to being as good as Disneyland. I was hyped at first at the entrance, wondering about the fun rides the park is going to offer but eventually i was greeted with disappointment when i took a look at the park map. Basically, the only fun ride was the Atlantis roller coaster and nothing else is that good. Plus, the place was packed with local students and I had to queue for 3 hours just for the Atlantis ride and trust me it wasn't pleasant at all. By the time we completed the ride, it was already evening. I would say they're trying to emulate disneyland with the castle and stuffs but boy was i wrong, as it wasn't even a ""fun"" experience at all. Rides were below average, some places were not covered with the 1 day pass and of course the massive crowd. I don't blame the crowd, but rather how small the park is to accommodate the large crowd.", December 2019
21,3.0,Overhyped,"A much overhyped amusement park, I'd say with nothing spectacular really. Generally great for thrill-seeking teenagers, perhaps adults, and families with young kids. Food is expectedly priced higher than usual. I'd say it's good enough to have been there, done that. Doesn't entice us to return unless there's major revamp.", December 2019
22,3.0,Super long queue even for a weekday,Visited on Tue 17 December 2019. Waited 1.5 hour for French Revolution VR. They should remove VR when it is not VR. Should have gotten the magic pass for this. Luckily this roller coaster ride is quite fun with a 360 degree turn. Only family rides have shorter queues around 5 to 1p minutes., December 2019
23,3.0,Nothing special just another tall building,5th tallest building in the world. On a cloudy day not worth going to the top of the floor. Fortunately you are able to go to the 31st floor (but have to queue for the access card) where the food court is and the Signature 7/11 is located. Nothing more nothing less., December 2019
24,1.0,Waiting times are very long even on a Monday. Staff are unfriendly and cold ,Nice theme park but not at $50 USD. Rides have long waiting times and staff are super difficult to deal with. You are better off going to a local disneyland or other theme parks at that price., December 2019
25,4.0,Good Place for Children and teenager,"I visit Lotte World on Sunday and the weather is light rain, unfortunate for me. Because the most extreme ride is closed. The rest is just good", December 2019
26,5.0,Great time for family!,kids enjoy the rides. Come during weekdays less hassle and queue. convenient facilities. Prayer room is available but need to be request access via intercom. ambiance were great. many parades able to catch on. value for money., November 2019
27,2.0,Alot of the ride needs extra payment and too long waiting time,"This amusement park is much more indoor-centric , and quite alot of the rides need extra payment which are not included in the entrance fee. And the waiting time are really crazy even on a school day. The outdoor park is quite small as well. In short, if you want to come here , I highly recommend you to get the Fast pass or else you would end up wasting alot of your time waiting.", November 2019
28,4.0,head on out there!,"Lotte world is just that, it's own little world that part amusement park, part indoor ice skating rink, underground aquarium part shop till you drop underground, followed by restaurants galore from street food to fine dining. It's your one day to explore underground activities all in one place. In the spring, it's one of the best place to catch in Seoul to catch cherry blossoms around the lake. There's plenty to do for all ages that it will literally take you the whole day if you just take slow and steady.", November 2019
29,1.0,Don‚Äôt even waste your time,"Worst place ever, even with a map it‚Äôs confusing to go around . Trying to be a Amusement park but it‚Äôs a giant arcade", November 2019
30,3.0,Not worth the Hype,"We went on a Thursday, wait times for the 3 rides worth going on were 70-80 minutes. It is more aimed at younger children than teenagers/adults. Definitely not a must do, especially if you‚Äôve already been to a Disneyland before.", November 2019
31,4.0,MUST VISIT,"We visited Lotte World  during our recent trip to Seoul  Great for all ages. I like both indoor and outdoor rides.Negative points: Queueing was 100 minutes for one ride. We didn't ride any of the popular rides because the queues were 90 to 110mins per ride.This is a whole world of entertainment. Outside park, inside entertainment, food hall and shopping¬† mall.", November 2019
32,4.0,Too many people,Avoid weekend if possible. We went on a Saturday. There were just too many people. The queue was too long. We only managed to catch a few rides. Suggest to pay extra to skip the queue., October 2019

34,4.0,Mid November Lotte World,Our kids enjoyed mainly the indoor theme activities rather than the outdoor as the weather is too cold and windy. Temperature was 1¬∞C. Suggest bringing own food for the muslims as there are no halal food in there. Kids enjoyed most of the activities. The indoor is huge. I suggest you guys starts from the top floor than down., November 2019

36,5.0,Amusement park ,"If using the train, go to the Jamsil Station. You can get to Lotte world without going outside, there is a connection underground. I have been to many amusement parks, and I would not say that this has the best rides but I would say that it was a really fun environment and a fun place for kids and for friends just walking around and going on rides. They do have some really awesome rides for adults, but I don't think the adults will be doing the hair and dress up to be a princess for the day. Especially when all the dresses are kids sizes. They have parades and showtimes which are great. Right now they still have the Halloween decorations up in the Halloween shows going on and I have to say they did an amazing job. The lines for the rides are pretty long on the weekends especially after 4 pm. Be aware that tickets have a discounted price after 4, which means a lot more people are there. So there is a pretty big crowd for the Halloween show in Magic Island. Make sure you hold your kids hands or you will lose them. After 4, it is also common for lines on rides to run an hour to 150 minutes for wait time. No exaggeration.", November 2019
37,5.0,Lotte World Park is great! ,Went with some friends to Lotte World and had a blast at the park! Made us feel like we were kids again! :), October 2019
38,1.0,NOT WORTH IT,"If you‚Äôre thinking of visiting this park - DON‚ÄôT!Absolutely terrible theme park!! I was so excited before for this theme park as it kept appearing in Korean variety shows, but it is SO FAR OFF from my expectations now the only emotion i have left for it is pure disgust. This park is a completely waste of time - the rides are old, trashy and not very well maintained. We waited 120mins to go on a ride called ‚ÄòFrench Revolution‚Äô but in return all we got was a massive headache from our heads banging on the seats, and spent 15mins recovering from that.A limited options of food and the taste is also not that great. The castle is extremely small, and here comes the worst attraction in the park - Ghost House. This attraction is such a joke, still left us traumatised. We waited an hour in line (when we still had hope for the park) for this horrendous attraction, and I felt my head was filled with crap after sitting down and basically watched a badly animated short-film when the protagonist - the cat, realised that he is not a real cat, but a ghost cat. Hence, even though we got there at approx 11am, we left at 4ish because we felt like we were ruining our mood by keep staying in the park despite the fact that we didn‚Äôt want to waste our money. And lastly, if you‚Äôve been to Disneyland or Universal studios theme parks and you‚Äôre used to their standards, don‚Äôt waste your time and money at Lotte World. Seriously. There are a lot more other fun stuff to do in Seoul and Lotte is definitely not one of them.", December 2018
39,5.0,all in one and value for money,"all the games is functions, i prefer lotte world as the location is convenient to travel by subway and the waiting queu is not too long but depends on days you visit it", March 2019
40,1.0,Such a stupid rule of magic pass,I don‚Äôt want to come here again for lifeEverything was suck and I can‚Äôt understand their rule of riding some Don‚Äôt wanna recommend here to anybody, November 2019
41,4.0,Love Lotte World!!!,"This is my second time going here. I like both indoor and outdoor rides! However, I prefer outdoor since it's more daring for older people. Depends on when you come, the park would decorate itself into Halloween/Christmas theme. I went during Halloween, and it was great to see display of Halloween; and I saw zombies come out in the evening to frighten people! It was scary and funny! Also, you can rent some cute clothes/high school/uniforms to walk around and take pictures!! Overall, if you're a foreigner--make sure to google ticket discount and go see Lotte World!! There are also restaurants indoor where you can buy food. It's waiting for you!!!", September 2019
42,3.0,free entry to park if not playing ?,can I just wonder around the park for free if I am not willing to play or I have to pay anyway a fee to enter the Lotte World?, October 2019
43,1.0,"Most big rides closed, rude staff and scammy pricing","What a disappointment this place was!We arrived at around 6pm for some evening fun, paying around ¬£30pp to get in. There was no indication at the ticket desk that most of the major rides were either closed or 'reservation only' - whatever that means.So upon entering the park, we try to get on some of the big rides:- French Revolution: Closed for 'Inspections'- Drop tower: Closed for 'Inspections'- Gyro drop: Just closed- Comet coaster: Reservations only, and rude staff- Atlantis coaster: Huge queue, but at the back of it 'Closed', and rude staffSome of the other smaller rides inside were pleasant enough, and the park is themed beautifully, just a shame that they decided to charge full price when all their major rides were innaccessible.Also, anytime we tried to spend money (including buying the tickets) with our GBP credit cards in the park, we were forced to use their scammy currency conversion and end up paying a huge fee. All the staff said paying in KRW 'doesn't work' - what a load of rubbish.In short, avoid this place at all costs and enjoy somewhere else in Seoul for the day or evening.", October 2019
44,4.0,Great fun ,"We got our tickets online with a magic pass 5 options. Basically you can choose 5 rides and cut the queues without having to book the timing like the magic pass on the main website. The entrance tickets are also discounted on the third party website. Apparently it is a promotion only for foreigners. So you have to bring your passport.The park itself was great fun. There were lots of rides for all thrill levels both indoors and outdoors. Atlantis, Gyro Drop, and French Revolution, were some of the more thrilling rides I remember riding. Definitely worth using the pass for. If you visiting with young kids I did see there were some rides that were only for young kids. The park really caters to all ages. For the Instagram mets there was also an area inside near the VR attractions for taking selfies. The selfie studio is set up with sets and props as well as tripods for rent. We loved taking pictures with the various backdrops.We happened to be there for Halloween, so there was also costume rentals and face painting (extra costs) near the entrance. There was even a haunted house set up. Not to forget the Halloween parade. We saw that they even has some of the park guests who were dressed as princesses participate. Lots of food affordable food available as well. Food stalls as well as set restaurants and food courts were available all over the park. There seems to have been no issues about bringing your own too. We brought in our own water.When it was time to go we exited into the Mall and we glad to find that there was a Lotte Mart around the corner of the exit. So manage to squeeze in a little grocery shopping before having to head back.Overall I felt it was a fun place to visit for the whole family.", October 2019
45,5.0,A Korean Disney,We bought tickets online.We got there by subway to the South entrance.There is a giant indoor park and an outdoor park.There is a wide variety of rides.However there are long queues for some of them.There is a folk museum inside the indoor park with stunning dioramas with thousands of models., August 2019
46,5.0,Fun afternoon for friends & kids,We took friends here who are visiting Korea for the first time.  It was also our first time.  We missed getting the magic passes that come with your regular park admission so will remember that for next time. We were also here for the big halloween party so crowds got heavier than I anticipated in the afternoon but we had a really nice time! My friend had trouble using her card- won is easiest. Lots of options for food and reasonable lines., October 2019
47,5.0,Seoul much fun in Lotte World,"My 6-year-old daughter and I visited Lotte World twice during our recent trip to Seoul. I must say at first i was worried the language barrier might spoil the fun but it turned out to be no problem at all! Every ride has clear bilingual instructions on height and safety rules, plus all the staff can communicate in basic english. There are plenty of rides to suite all ages, but the outdoor rides in Magic Island are mostly for older kids over 130 or 140cm tall.I would suggest you purchase the Magic Pass for Express entrance if you wanna avoid long queues,  especially on weekends and holidays.Yeah so definitely recommend Lotte World if you like theme parks. My child says it's more fun than Universal Studios and Legoland.", October 2019
48,4.0,Fun place to Visit,This is a fun indoor park to visit while you're in Korea. There are plenty of activities for the young and old alike., November 2018
49,3.0,A traditional city amusement park,"Its been around forever and if youre a foreigner on sight seeing, no need to go inside unless you are up to ride some in the theme park. Mostly very crowded with kids and teenagers and family units. There arent much alternatives around the city anyways.", September 2019
50,4.0,Halloween may be the best time to go?,"We decided to go to this park on a whim. Lotte world is the biggest indoor theme park (in the world?). It is at the edge of the lotte department store at Jamsil station. If you buy an online ticket you need to walk all the way around the park to the southern gate and then enter that side. It doesnt matter where you leave your bags as the lockers are accessible from several exits of the park. The park extends outdoors and there are some events centred around halloween. Specifically the indoor haunted house is not very scary but the outdoor house with entry fee of 5000 won is very scary. 5/5 spooks. Rules involved. Don't let go of the rope, no running, don't blind the actors. The wait times in the park are so mixed and with a ticket you only get to reserve 3 rides. I didnt really like this system as some rides are reservation only and can run out very fast. I recommend you book asap for a ride that looks interesting as we missed out on both of the massive indoor roller coasters operating that day. Furthermore the outdoor 3 biggest coasters were all closed for maintenance. A wait time under 30 minutes is tolerable and not worth wasting a magic pass on. The staff were also mind enough to let my friend and I into the same ride even though she was in the reserved session after mine. My other big complaint is that staff are very unprofessional and let their friends into rides ahead of the queue. There was a halloween show that started 6pm and two friends went in to chat with their mate despite the sign saying it is dangerous for individuals. It also seems impossible to access the ice skating rink without leaving the park. Some staff tell you to leave if you're a foreigner to use the outside escalstor and you won't be let back into the park.", September 2019
51,3.0,Lotto World Visit,"The main attractions were closed,  however there was no notice when we purchased tickets.  Waiting time is up to 90 min,  so suggest to buy a magic pass.  Good for children up to 14 maybe!!  Mine were 14&16, so not really interested.", September 2019
52,5.0,Lotte world at 50% discount for foreigner,"We went on 11/9/19 (chuseok: 12-14/9/19). There's usually a 50% discount for foreigners. Coupon usually avail on their website only few days before the holiday. initially we wanted to go on another day after 4pm (with the half-day ticket) but since there's a 50%, we went full day. We r glad that we made the right choice. We went in around 9+. There's little or no queue at all in the morning. We therefore do all the popular rides first. We were even able to do twice on some of the rides. Hours later the queue starts to build up but still we were able to queue within 15-30mins for most rides. We were there till 4pm and managed to complete all the rides that are suitable for our kids aged 5&8. When we exit around 4pm, we saw a long queue outside at the ticketing counter and was so glad that we didn't go for the after 4pm option.", September 2019
53,5.0,Best place for indoor games,This was the best place to play indoor games. There are also variety outdoor games. The price was affordable, October 2018
54,3.0,There is NO HALAL restaurant in Lotte World,The Pasha restaurant already CLOSE. Thus the only option that I notice is sulbing bingsu shop or bring some snacks from the lotte mart outside. We left early and not manage to finish exploring the entire park since we are so hungry. Most of the staff excluding the information counter personnel cannot speak and understand English which is very sad., September 2019
55,4.0,Good old Lotte world,"We went in at 10 a.m. which was the opening time but there was already a long queue in front of entrance. Soooo many students since it was summer holidays. We knew what we wanted to go for so ran to French revolution as soon as we entered. One of the most popular rides. We rode within 10 mins and went on to next one, Pirates ship, managed to ride within 15 mins. We tactfully chose the rides with shorter queue and  could ride many rides for the first few hours. It was possible because I am very familiar with rides and how to go about. If you are to come in in the afternoon, I strongly suggest 2 ways to shorten your queue time.  I am not talking about buying ridiculously expensive fast passes. Something you can do for free. Lotte world uniquely offer 3 fast access  using their own App. Magic pass App. Of course you will want to have more than 3 passes since there are many popular ones but better than nothing. You first need to scan or manually register your entrance tickets on App. Press reserve ride. Each ride opens up every 15 mins to choose time slot. Within seconds, slots will be gone. It is difficult to explain here. Once you try to use App, you will get the hang of it soon.  If you are not very technical person or have slow finger, I would suggest another way. Know what you want to ride and go there. At each entrance of ride, you will see ticket reservation machine. Simply scan your ticket then it will give out next available time slot. Bring that paper at given time and go to fast pass way. Only downside of this method is you need to physically go to ride and scan your tickets.  If your 3 rides are all scattered around, you need to walk around so much. I suggest you to choose 3 rides relatively close to each other. Atlantis, French revolution,  pirates ship and gyro drop are the must-trys. There were 3 horror houses but I didn't try since my 2 kids were too scared to go in. The most popular one was at magic island which is outdoor. It's a shame that you need to pay 5000 won to go in. There are many variety of restaurants to choose from.  Korean, Japanese, Chinese and burgers...etc. Many stalls sell  Lottel world goods and desserts.Lotte world rides can entertain from toddlers to teenagers. They have more indoor rides than outdoor ones. Perfect for rainy days. We stayed until 4 p.m. and rode most of the rides using App and reservation machines. Without a plan, you could wait for hours for each ride so plan well ahead.", August 2019
56,1.0,Too crowded,Too many people. Each ride need to queue up for at least 2 hours. Never go again. The theme park is very old., August 2019
57,4.0,Enjoyable day out ,"Spent my birthday at Lotte World Adventure and I must say that this place exceeded my expectations. I was concerned that it would be more suitable for young children and whilst there are really a lot of rides and attractions catered towards a children and a younger audience, there were plenty of things for adults to entertain themselves with with as well. Unfortunately, we went on a super wet and rainy day and could not try all the rides on the Magic Island (what they call the outdoor area) because they all closed once it started pouring. Thankfully there is a relatively large and pleasant indoor area but we had to queue for ages for the indoor rides. My advice before going to Lotte World is to plan your visit well. Decide which rides or attractions you want to visit, and consider if its worth investing in the Magic Passes. We spent most of our day queueing and it can get quite frustrating to stand in lines for 50-60 minutes at a time. The Magic Passes would save time for sure but if I'm not mistaken, you still need to ""fight"" for certain ride slots. Do check that you aren't going on a public or school holiday in S. Korea and do avoid weekends. We went on a random Thursday - to our knowledge there were no holidays, but still the place was packed with school children and teenagers.Another tip - don't miss the Folk Museum! It was actually a really impressive museum and we enjoyed exploring the exhibits.", September 2019
58,5.0,As good as any theme park,"I didn‚Äôt do much research before coming here and expect a rather simple theme park. I am wrong. It has all a theme park to offer and more. From outdoor rides to indoor activities. It was a rainy day but we still able to catch some outdoor rides like the gyro drop, spin and comet express. The indoor part is also huge with so many rides and activities. Lots of food outlets. Never out of choices. A day is not enough. One tip is never buy ticket on site. Better to purchase through online site such as klook or Trazy as you can get almost half price. Also don‚Äôt forget to visit the museum. Worth a visit.", September 2019
59,4.0,Good for young youth,Very nice well designed place with lots of rides.  Its both indoor and outdoor.  It is very similar to Disney., July 2019
60,4.0,Short visit to Lotte World,"As i went with a tour guide, we only had a few hours there and shortage of time and it was really crowded so we did not ice skate or play with any of the rides. We just walked around, take photos..Quite boring if youre already there but unable to play..They have a mall for you to shop too but again, due to time constraint we were unable to walk around and shop. So if you plan to come here, please ensure youre not in a tour group and do not go during peak season as time will be wasted in queuing up for the rides as it will get really crowded", February 2019
61,4.0,Fun in the city,"Lotte world is a nice amusement park right in the city. There is a indoor section and an outdoor section so even on rainy days and in winter you can still go and have a good time. There are plenty of places to eat and drink in the park. The inside part has balloon shape cars that go around the ceiling and a wild indoor rollercoaster.  There is a stage that has performances several times a day. Between the park and the metro station there is a big shopping mall. So you could go the park, go shopping, eat and never have to go outside. Great for those cold rainy days.", July 2019
62,4.0,Daughter loves it!,"It was a rainy day in Seoul and I still wanted my daughter to experience Seoul. I remembered Lotte World was indoor and it would be something she would enjoy. She made little comments here and there about it not being Disney, but once she walked inside she loved everything she saw. Lines were pretty long, but that‚Äôs to be expected.  Fun little rides for the kids and little entertainment segments and even a photography section where you can take pics on your own camera making it a photo shoot.", August 2019
63,3.0,Kids paradise - we went on the wrong day!,"The theme park is pretty big with lots of rides and fully indoor so you don't have to worry about the rain. Young children, in particular, would love it here as it's really catered for them. One regret I had was that I visited on a public holiday, so together with tourists, local Koreans and their families thronged this place. Wished that I had bought the Magic Pass to skip the queues as some rides, you will need to wait up to 2 hours long!", August 2019

65,5.0,Magic Pass Day Pass,"There are 2 different kinds of magic passes. One is 5 rides and the other is day pass. What I learned today was that magic day pass is unlimited and no need to book. You just show up and enjoy a ride. Important point is that this day pass is only available for the first 100 customers who come to the magic pass stand inside of the lotte world. So once you get in with your general access card, go to the magic pass stand right away to get yours. We were there until 6pm with plenty of resting and eating. But did at least 13 rides. Highly recommended. Good luck and hope you enjoy your visit.", August 2019
66,2.0,Long lines and half the rides close early or are broken down. ,Doubt there is any safety regulations here like most public access places. They  close the rides early outside and some inside. Carousel horses are about the only ride open til closing time. Few restrooms available like most Korean public places. Very few exits for fire safety like most public places in Korea., October 2018
67,1.0,Too busy and strange rules!!!,"The park is too busy , it waste of money to go there and pay USD50 for an adult where you are do nothing else waiting in a queue for your kids... also you are not allowed to go outside the park and come back using the same ticket!!!I prefer going to ‚ÄúEVERLAND‚Äù instead.", August 2019

69,3.0,For kids,"I booked a tour package for the day that included Nami Island and Lotte World. It was a good place to be in if you had young kids. My son didn't enjoy this place at all and he was in a hurry to leave. I had to see everything since we paid for the entrance already. We didn't do the rides, we just watched the shows and walked around. What I like about the place is there was an indoor part of the park. It was a warm day and we walked around the outdoor park and left. The bonus I guess was the mall where we got to buy Lotte products in the grocery store.If you have kids of young ages, they would enjoy this very much.", May 2019

72,1.0,Not english and baby friendly at all,"We got a baby and we have asked if we could take the ride before queueing up and Hans, the facilitator, said yes. After queueing up for 1.5hr, he refused us to take the ride and said we had to get him a baby ticket instead. It was absolutely unfair as I have double checked with him before queueing up, he should have let us know right from the beginning before letting us to queue up for so long so that we would get a baby ticket first. We were treated unfairly as no facilitator or sign has told us to get a baby ticket at the entrance nor at the ride. We actually have bought three adults tickets (which costed more) for 2 adults and a baby instead, we have shown the tickets to him, but still he insisted that we have to get a baby ticket instead. The facilitators there did not check any other tickets but us. :( We felt like we were treated differently just because we were not Korean. We were absolutely disappointed. Please don't go there if you can't speak Korean as non of them understand English properly.", July 2019

74,3.0,Underwhelming ,"Plus points:-*Easy to get to. Majority is inside which is great in hot weather or rain. Very well organised and clean. Lovely friendly characters. Many many good quality food stalls for families from snack stands to restaurants. Very large area which does have a little for everybody. Negative points:-*please check your children‚Äôs height before going. We do not have particularly smallChildren (6+9) but we found out they couldn‚Äôt ride the majority of the rides. My 6 year old was even too short for the swings! I don‚Äôt know if it was H&S but the sizes were strange. We could only go around the video rides, amusement arcades and a few of the street games.  It looks like a magical place but we felt very flat. It feels like a cheaper version of Disney, even down to the red bow. It looses something with all the similarities, there are so many. I would have loved it to be more Korean.  Street procession was like a Brazil carnival. Queueing was 100 minutes for one ride and it was a very humid/rainy day which makes me think on a nicer day it could be worse.One thing is guaranteed, this place will have you haemorrhaging money.  We paid W198,000.00 (family of 4)and that was without the added extras like museum entrance. There are also things like ‚ÄúThe Mirror Maze‚Äù, darts games and other attractions that will cost you extra, you can buy additional tickets next to the rides for these. It‚Äôs a very costly day. We were left disappointed but that was due to the lack of availability for rides for a 6&9 year old, who have visited many parks and ridden the same rides in other areas. The children felt cheated and upset at constantly not reaching the required height knowing they have ridden it before.", July 2019

77,4.0,Lotte World (indoor amusement park),"This is one of the most famous amusement parks in Seoul. A trip to Seoul would never be complete without visiting this place. It is located at the city center , connecting to a mall and half of the rides are inside enclosed facility. It looks a bit crowded and I personally still prefer recreational parks in the open. If you are ""afraid of the sun"" then this is ideal for you. LOL!  Could have been better if the instructions were in English and the personnel knows how to speak as well.", August 2018
78,4.0,Not that big but enjoyable.,"Not like other countrie's theme park this place is located in the middle of Seoul. It can be reach by subway easily. It is connect with shopping malls and hotel.  In Lotte World food is not reconmendable , actually it is expensive, taste not so great.I recommend you have meal in Lotte mall's food court before you get into Lotte World.If you have more than 4th grade they can hanging around and get ride without you.Since place is not that big you can have relax moments. It is safe and clean. Eventhough it is little old but well maintained.", June 2019
79,5.0,The best hotel in Seoul!,"a hotel with a feeling of a little old, but a kind enough to forget that part quickly. From the moment I enter the hotel, I feel the kindness of the staff. The point is that they are truly expressing their kindness. The pool is old, but it's managed so well that it doesn't feel like it. The food in the Club Lounge was fresh and delicious, and there are no flaws except that there are two kinds of beer in the Happy hour time.The club lounge breakfast was a good combination of Korean food and other foods, and the omelettes in the live session are a pleasure to watch and eat, so I recommend you to experience it. (You will see the smile and kindness of the chef)", July 2019
80,4.0,A fun outing for all!!,We had wanted to get there by 9:30 for opening time but didn‚Äôt quite make it until 11 am. My advice arrive to the mall for 9 - eat breakfast at the mall. We used Govoyagin to buy tickets on the spot for discounted tickets. The earlier you get there the shorter the lines. Our girls spent most of the day in lines. Our 7 yr old  son was able to go on rides for his age quite frequently. There is plenty of space to sit and rides for all ages. Overall a good way to spend the day., July 2019

82,4.0,Better than Everland,This has an INDOOR & OUTDOOR PARK connected with each other. Though not very big but it is entertaining and we found it better than Everland. 30 minutes drive within SEOUL. An entertaining day where kids can enjoy. Offers an ice skating stadium too, June 2019
83,3.0,Big but no longer new,"Good to spend a day in the theme park but nothing more even if you cannot cover everything. We bought the 1 day pass with 5 times express credits. Managed to use most on more popular rides and most are located in the outdoor section.Disappointed that a few exciting rides are undergoing maintenance work. To be honest, been to much much better theme park with fantastic rides.Remember, there is no reentry unlike many other theme Parks. Like those in Singapore, Australia and Japan etc.A good experience but not a must come.", June 2019

85,3.0,Not the best theme park,"If you want to have an experience of Korean theme parks with lots of Korean people around, give it a try. But if you're a theme park fanatic, I'd give it a miss. I also found it disappointing that pretty much every outdoor ride shuts down when it rains. I understand safety must come first, but it was disappointing to have bought a fast pass and not be able to ride any of the rides I wanted to. I'm glad I went just to see it, but I wouldn't go back.", June 2019
86,5.0,Amusement park in Seoul downtown,"Affordable amusement park in the minddle of Seoul.  For foreigner, please take ticket from Klook...cheapest.I went during summer and weekdays, no hard queue....enjoy park...", June 2019
87,1.0,"If you like queues, you'll love this place","We went on a Friday after Memorial day holiday in Seoul. May have been the most stupid time to go other than memorial day itself.I paid for 3 tickets on Kloop (ticket collection was far away from the main entrance... A good 10-15min walk after asking 3 different people) and added 5 magic passes to two of those tickets for an extra S$100. What a waste of money. The magic pass system is terrible. Every 15 minutes the system opens to allow time slots to be booked to reserve the ride and skip the queue. It has very limited number of time slots each hour and try as we might, for 2 hours we could not reserve anything. Each time the reservation started... It showed all slots filled/closed about 10 seconds after it opened. Eventually all time slots had been reserved and we had to queue with everyone else. So that was $100 down the drain.We didn't ride any of the popular rides because the queues were 90 to 110mins per ride. We were there for 10 hours (until closing time) and rode 5 rides all day.We thought... Screw it let's pay extra to play the VR games.... But no... There's a height restriction and my girl was 5cm below it. Also, the stupid parade that they run through the main indoor Adventure land around 2pm will section off large areas which cannot be crossed easily or at all (during some parts of the parade). So don't get separated or you won't be able to return until after the parade ends. And all this online advice about going for the popular rides during the parade I found to be bull crap.... The queues were long and getting longer still... While my 10yr old enjoyed it, as an adult - I wouldn't wish the experience on my worst enemy. Only a parents love for his kids got me through this day. Just be prepared to queue. Bring your tunes and your headphones, battery pack for your phones, a portable fan (sweaty queues whether indoor or out), snacks, drinks, and pack light. There are plenty of lockers but they are single use so if you do use them then make sure you keep the important stuff with you. One thing I wish I had was a collapsible stool. You will stand for a long long time at Lotte World in queue after queue. I saw some parent bring a picnic mat for the kids to sit and lie on. She was a local with local knowledge. Food and beverage prices are not super expensive but nor are they cheap. Expect to pay amusement park prices.I wish I could say something nice about Lotte World but I can't. I just taste bitterness.", June 2019
88,4.0,Some Attractions Need Upgrading,"Lotte World has its own charm. Its indoor attractions are worth-trying.  At the Magic Island,  we tried the Gyro Drop and it was fine.  Horror of Horrors...  The Horror House had a long line of people and we waited for almost an hour. We were given 3D glasses as we entered. The design of the viewing room was okay but when the show began,  I realized that it truly wasn't worth the wait. The poor content of the 3D show was disappointing.  I slept throughout the rest of the viewing time.  The effects were way below my expectations and the absence of a good story frustrated me no end. If only I could tell the people outside that they have to look for another attraction,  I could have done it so. Well,  the administrators of this theme park have to give this a quick response.", June 2019
89,5.0,Magical place for little ones!!!!,"Went during spring break with a group of first graders. The kids loved it and me too:) The park is huge and and I think it has enough attractions for little ones. The parade at 2:00 p.m was amazing the kids enjoyed it while eating ice cream. I loved the fact that the park has an indoor area and the outdoor which is great when there is not good weather or air quality. Overall, if you are in Seoul and have the opportunity visit Lotte World!!!!!", April 2019

95,4.0,Lots of fun,"Came here on a weekday evening, on an ""after 4pm"" discounted ticket, with our 3 y.o. No real crowds, maybe some most popular adult rides had ~15 minute lines, but we breezed through it without spending more than 5 minutes in a line. Looks like most of the visitors are local young adults, so kid-focused areas didn't look busy.  Lots of fun to have for all ages. Only few rides were available for toddlers, but it was quite enough for us. Also keeping in mind just the fun value of exploring all the territory, plus a little musical play they perform, it all comes down to at the very least 2 hours of activities enough to exhaust your kid. One big minus and -1 for the number of activities which require extra cost. Didn't use any of them out of principle, so don't know if they are worth it or not... But entry fee is high enough, I'd rather pay extra $5 and not be annoyed when stumbling into some random place only to be met with ""sorry, this costs extra"". All of them looked completely empty as well...", May 2019
96,3.0,Overwhelming,"We accidentally went the day after Children's Day, so there were lots of school groups.

97,5.0,Plan your day ahead of time to get the best out of your park visit,"Here are my tips for you to get the best out of your Lotte World visit so you can spend less time on queuing:1.  Go on a weekday2.  Buy your ticket on trazy.com.  there's a special promo exclusive for foreigners which gives you an option to purchase the admission ticket at 16% off + 3 Magic Pass rides + free sausage + 1 free VR attraction for just an extra $20. It is definitely worth it.  There is also an option for 5 Magic Pass rides.3.  Download the Lotte World app so you can check queue times and decide which ride to best use your magic pass on. There's an option to reserve on the app but those are usually gone in minutes so it's best to visit the magic pass kiosk in the 1st flr and B1 (location is in the map).  Pls note that you have to use your 1st magic pass first before you can make another kiosk reservation.4.  On top of the 3 magic passes, you can use your ticket as a magic pass 3 more times.  So you actually get 6 magic passes total.  Just go straight to the ride itself, no reservations needed.", May 2019
98,1.0,Bad bad bad ~~~,"I am so regretting what I wrote about this hotel just before. It‚Äôs bad for club guest.

99,5.0,We loved it,"Went with my 7 year old daughter. For several of the rides we went on we did have to wait for about 20 mins. There were some long lines for the roller coaster and  the boat ride but I was not about to wait over 90 minutes to get on these. Plenty of food options. A great day out, with plenty of things that would interest all ages. Oh and if you pay for the tickets by Mastercard you get 20% discount on the admission price. That was a nice surprise which I did not know about!", April 2019

102,1.0,Not worth a visit. If you do dont buy a Magicpass! ,I'm writing this while still in the queue for our second ride. We have been here for 4 and a half hours now. I was afraid it could be crowded so we went on a Monday and I bought a 5x Magicpass which i could not use a single time because all seats have been booked out almost immediately for all attractions which are popular.I think its only worth a visit if you are totally into waiting or if you come with children because the attractions for small children seem to have less waiting times., April 2019
103,4.0,Mini Disneyland,Beautiful amusement park. We chose to go here because there's both an indoor and outdoor park. My 8 year old daughter really enjoyed the parade. It was really nice. We had a really good time with our family and friends., December 2018
104,1.0,Cheated by tour operator Cosmojin Travel Agency / Viator,"Here is our experience: 3 adults and 2 kids We were picked up at 8.30 from the hotel and taken to Lotte World. The trip took some 60 min and after getting organized with tickets etc it was already 10. We were told to return to the meeting point at 11.20. We all got full day tickets including any rides.  After getting familiarized we realized that there were so all Magic tour tickets available allowing to skip the line. Further more also attendants tickets for adults just following the kids around and not doing rides. Cheaper of course. Our 4 year old managed 3 rides and our 12 year old managed only 1 and had to give up the 2nd ride due to too long queue . At 11.23 we were noticed that time was up and time to return either direct to hotel or to a shopping center. We opted for the shopping center which turned out to be a small souvenir shop.Later on I reviewed what we had booked and paid for USD 294 . It was a whole day Lotte World Package Deal. If by any chance Viator or the tour operator read this, our Booking reference was BR-697267984We were clearly cheated. We had enough other things to do in Seoul so did not do anything about this then. But now thinking back I like to warn others for this...", April 2019
105,3.0,"Great for kids and teens, lackluster for adults",The place is huge and the best thing about it is that most rides are indoors. We didn't even realize that it had been raining for most of the day till we rode the train at Jamsil station (the station is connected to the mall) and got off Myeongdong station. I yawned through most of the rides and the queues were extremely long as we were there on a weekend. The kids (ages 9 and 10) enjoyed themselves though. They got to enjoy VR rides that gave them the impression they were riding actual roller coasters. Other underground rides they found too scary so we spent most of our time at Wild Tours located on 1F., April 2019

Sidestep to the one hour of ice skating where my friend ice skated well, his first time & I was speed skating in rental skates OMG so much margarita courage! hahaha having an amazing time. Actually we lost any idea of time but it was running out. Made our way to the foreign guest entrance for Lotte world which was challenging, yet we made it in. We lost things along the way some shopping a power bank....hahaha when we finally found the indoor French revolution rollercoaster there was a 70min estimated wait  ! ""then"" an angle appeared out of nowhere and vip`d us to the front of a queue with a magic pass. It was actual magic. Thank goodness ! Then an awesome 4D movie adventure Flyventure excellent We did see a lights parade & indoor fireworks during our chaotic cascade through this indoor entertainment shrine. All in all we miss-judge available time & missed alot but still have and amazing fun tale to tell. Really it was very cool very wow !Arriving as late as we did the full price would not have been great value.

107,3.0,Great stay!,"Check in was easy and friendly. Obviously the location is excellent if you like to shop or go to Lotte world theme park. There‚Äôs a subway station right in front. Not a lot to do nearby once the mall closes at 10. My friend enjoyed the sauna while my teens enjoyed the theme park. The beds were comfortable but the rooms had no drawer space. Hotel‚Äôs bakery did have much but there‚Äôs plenty to eat a decent breakfast at the underground shopping (go downstairs thru the Lotte department store doorway)There‚Äôs lotteria, angel in us coffee shop(breakfast sandwich), krispy creme(doughnuts), samsong bakery(famous bread/pastries),odeng place that opens before the mall opens.

The Haunted House and Hall of Mirrors are not included and cost extra (because there‚Äôs profit to be had, that‚Äôs why).It‚Äôs a very strange place that looks like a deranged billionaire took elaborate steps to exactly copy Disney World but had a lawyer tweak it all juust enough to not be sued.Expect Rickey Louse, Roland Cluck and their slow-witted accomplice Doofy (with his dog Plato) to ride on parade singing about how amazing the LOTTE Corporation (a division of GloboDynamix Defence Systems) is, overpriced nibbles permeating the air with 20 calories of sugar per breath, lines stretching into the next millennium and people everywhere, no space unfilled by person, not an iota of room not occupied by human, literally 100% of all available capacity used by corpus humanis.

Looking at it at another perspective, I find this location a very popular spot for locals especially students and kindergartens. No doubt the basic amenities such as toilets are well maintained, so they are clean and functional. Plenty of food stalls and restaurants spread out so one never runs out of options.There are plenty of articles floating round on the tips so parents do read them, otherwise invest in Magic Pass Premium, download the Lotte World Adventure Magicpass app to enjoy a few rides with dedicated time slots. Of course, avoid peak season if you can!Our children (7 and 1+) were enjoying themselves nevertheless, but the waiting time really did eat up most hours, not forgetting time for lunch/dinner and breaks. The number of rides/attractions are sufficient to keep the kids occupied enough that they can never finish all the rides.The indoor theme park can be like a maze so parents need to read the map carefully while trying to match the ride timing so that one would not miss the parade. So it's not just an adventure for the kids/teens, but also quite another one for the parents!", February 2019
121,4.0,Amazing indoor park,"It is a huge indoor park with a small outdoor section as well. Reach early as it is not possible to cover the whole park in 2 day. It's was Christmas week so Christmas evening parade was worth seeing. Many VR rides are very good so are the outdoor ones like roller coaster, gyro etc...A must visit place.", December 2018
122,1.0,Don‚Äôt even think about it ,"Came here with my sister on a Wednesday and it was packed with students. No personal space during the line up, will most likely get bumped.  Waiting time were minimum 2 hours. What foreigners need to know is that they have a lotte world adventure apps where u can reserve 3 rides per person. We only knew about it at 11am and most of the rides were fully booked for all the slots. Managed to book the pharaoh which was somewhat a fun ride. It‚Äôs called the magic pass reservation. Be sure to reserve magic pass for the more trilling rides after getting your tickets! We waited for the French Revolution for a whooping 3.5hours. The ride lasted less than a minute, and VR was working. Not the best experience. Never going again. You will see the longest queue in your life. Went there at 930am left at 8pm. Managed to get on 5 rides only. Not worth my time and money tbh. Should‚Äôve went to Everland. People in their 20s should just go to Everland for more thrilling rides. This place can be skipped for sure.", January 2019
123,2.0,Worst park ever ,"We went there on a Monday, in the morning. But the amount of people queuing was unbelievable. The waiting time was at least one hour, up to 3hours. The most popular rides have longer waiting time, ofc. During 6 hours spend there we took 3 rides total. You can buy a magic pass, but that costs extra 100k and you can‚Äôt use it on all rides. And let‚Äôs be honest, 50$ for the regular ticket is not so cheap. Also, you have to pay extra for some of the rides/attractions. To sum up, I don‚Äôt recommend it neither will I go there again.", February 2019
124,4.0,Good for business trip,"Room was clean, hotel staff were very polite. Hotel was conected to a department store. Very convenient for shopping.", February 2019
125,2.0,Never again,"Huge crazy place. A lot of people, huge queue. In fact you will not have opportunity visiting more then only few action cause the time in queue takes about 1:30 hours.", February 2019
126,3.0,Cool place,"Was here with a couple of friends (all in our twenties). Whilst it was a cool place, I dont think I would go here if not on either a date or with kids. For me the best thing was just seeing the indoors theme park and looking at cool things. The lines for most rides are pretty long. And one of the few things we did was go on a balloon that goes around the theme park in the roof. Which was pretty cool, but not worth waiting 90 minutes with a korean yelling/singing into a speaker constantly for every group going on a new balloon. The part with the games and stuff was okay but not great.", February 2019
127,5.0,WooooW,"Its was wonderful experience, i was in Signiel hotel next to Lotte World.First it was easy to reach the place .Second its really huge place and amazing.Third next year for sure i will visit Seoul with my family.", April 2018
128,5.0,Highly Entertaining,There's so much things to enjoy here good for adults and kids. Everyone will enjoy even on winter since most of this is indoor.The parade is amazing. You should see this when you visit., January 2019
129,4.0,Big indoor park ,"For the winter season, it is good to visit Lotte World because they have both an indoor and an outdoor theme park. If it gets too cold for the kids outdoors, then just bring them to the 4-storey indoor park.", January 2019
130,5.0,Like Disneyland,"We were there during the winter. It was packed with people. Can't get into any rides as the waiting line was unending - gotta wait for at least 45mins per ride. Tonnes of kiosks and shops selling snacks, food and souvenirs. There's an indoor & outdoor park with lotsa rides.We got to watch their Christmas Parade too. Awesome!!!!If you want to go to Lotte World I would suggest that you go during off peak season. Then you'll benefit from the rides.", December 2018
131,5.0,Fun Out,my first visit to the lotte world was great. It has a shopping place outside the lotte world. once in the lotte world. there is 2 section where indoor section is more for kids of primary school level and the outdoor section is more thrill with rides. Need to gear up if going on cold weather., December 2018
132,4.0,A colourful world full of fun,"Never miss to visit this Amusement park if you are in Seoul with your kids.There are lot of rides, shows and a whole lot of eating options. And not to be missed is Carnival parade which boosts of more than 200 performers singing and dancing as they take a round around the park. The park also stages various themed musicals at their central stage where one can sit and enjoy them.Beware most your time may be spent waiting to take the rides nd be ready to shell out more for your food than it is worth.This park is huge, plan full day here.", May 2018
133,4.0,Shoppers Paradise ,"This shopping mall was directly across from my hotel , and even though I hate shopping I had to have a peek . A massive shopping centre with about everything you could want to but all under one roof . Also some very nice restaurants and food stalls with some very nice snacks . Electronics, food and clothes for every occasion. I must visit for those who like to shop .", January 2019
134,4.0,Good place - with flaws,"Here, Lotte World, is one of the biggest theme park in Korea. Although it is smaller than Everland, it has more thril rides here. Personally recommand French Revolution, Gyro Swing, and Atlantis for adults. Most of the other rides are for children/family. And be prepared for very long lines and harsh prices of foods.", January 2019
135,2.0,One star for the parade! + one for the Disney castle,"Ok, we were here on a Saturday night which is probably not ideal as it is very busy. The rides are mainly for little kids, so, nothing too exciting for adults. We wanted to go on the hot air balloon ride but the queue was 2 hrs. We queued for about 1/2hr for the monorail ride but because it‚Äôs winter, half of the ride route was cancelled, so, it was a very short one. Some nice photo ops outside at the Disney looking castle, so, make sure you go out of the building & walk around a bit. We were lucky that there was a Christmas parade - this was the highlight of this visit.", January 2019
136,5.0,Nice day out,Family day out Theme park and shopping underground and all the big stores Must visit The tallest tower for lovely views over Seoul., December 2018
137,4.0,Another Happiest Place,"At first time I‚Äôm not expect too much for this place because I think they only have rides just for children and not that big enough. But, surprisingly this place is sure big enough and have various rides for adult. I like Atlantis and French Revolution. But, unfortunately Flume Ride was out of service when I came. I‚Äôm not a fan of challenging attraction so yeah I skipped for viking and gyro rides.", November 2018
138,4.0,Xmas visit!,"Visited Lotte World as part of a tour group package. Spent about 4 hours here, from 5pm to 9pm. Place was semi packed with mostly couple's and families. Certain attractions such as the horror house and mirror maze requires an additional fee of 3000won to enter.Most of the rides were mild as this is a family theme park. Do try the ice skating rink on the lowest floor and there are several food options around to choose from", January 2019
139,4.0,Be prepared,"Be prepared to wait in lines and you're fine. I visited during super hot August and the lining was horrible. However, the attractions are fun and different from the ones I've been in other countries. I highly recommend the indoor roller coaster, Comet express, and Atlantis Adventure roller coaster. Just the indoor park itself is a sight to see. Go early in the morning if you want to experience everything.", August 2018
140,4.0,Fun place for family and children,Lotte world celebrates its 30th anniversary this year (2019) and there are many shows and nice decoration around the theme park to commemorate that.  The rides are still fun (despite some of them being really old) and insanely popular., January 2019
141,3.0,Indoor theme park for small kids,"The warmth in the indoor theme park was very welcome with the freezing cold outside. However, the indoor rides were more for smaller kids less than 12 years old probably. Very long queues on a holiday and weekend. We stayed in an AirBnB across the theme park so transportation was not a problem.", July 2018
142,3.0,Crowded and expensive,We spent a Thursday afternoon at Lotte World indoor. It is great for the 6&4 yo that we have but it was so crowded. Every ride took a long wait and it felt that rides for small children were all filled by teenagers. We spent US$150 for ultimately 4 rides and that took us 3 hours and all our energy. Safety precautions seemed way over the top (e.g. all had to wear a safety belt in the carrousel)., December 2018
143,1.0,Below average park. ,"I guess because it's indoor there were more emphasis on VR rides and experiences. Not the place to go if you're looking for thrill rides. The queuing time was ridiculous - over a hour unless you have a magic pass. The signs for the rides or the facilities are not clear. I walked a full circle looking for the toilets to discover it was right where I was. The stairs and escalators were hard to find going up or down a floor. Some experiences you have to pay extra for and you don't know this unless you go up to it like the VR experience on B3. They had a tour pamphlet all in Korean with the ice rink in it and we thought it was part of Lotte World. The park staff on B3, with very poor English, so I think she said, we'll be exiting the park and reentry is not permitted. So to sum up. Spent most of my time going around a big circle looking for stairs and elevators to go up or down a floor to go around in a circle to look for rides and experiences which takes a hour of queuing because people with magic passes takes priority so they take up the seats first.", December 2018
144,4.0,Litre world,Avoid at Christmastime! Great place to visit but queuing for 2 hours for most rides took the shine off. I don't know how much a magic pass is but I think it would be worth investigating to go to the front of every line., December 2018
145,4.0,Fun for those who like theme parks ,"Lotte World is a large indoor theme park covering multi stories and including an outdoor area. The rides range from kiddie rides through to relatively large roller coasters that older kids will love. If you‚Äôre coming in winter, be prepared to layer on and off if you‚Äôre going to be in or outside. Best to arrive first thing when the crowds are small and queues are short - go to the most popular rides first - Atlantis, French Revolution, Pharaoh‚Äôs Rage etc. otherwise be prepared to queue for up to 2 hours when the crowd builds up especially in the holiday season. The park is clean and well presented and offers a Disney-eque feel complete with their own Snow White Castle. The entry ticket (we got 20% off using MasterCard) is generally all inclusive (a small handful of rides require extra payment). There is a range of food from local to western. Prices are generally higher than outside. There is a Lotte World app that can book Magic Passes (like Disney fast passes) but we couldn‚Äôt get them to work; perhaps they need to be booked first thing. So, suggest some pre-planning is essential to get the best out of the park.", December 2018
146,4.0,Good  theme park with indoor and outdoor rides ,Spend a full day at this theme park. It is crowded especially during this school vacation season. They had quite a wide  variety of rides to cater to the different age groups. It provided enough thrill to keep my 3 teenagers occupied.  They have plenty food options to satisfy your hunger. Good place esp if you have kids / teenagers ., December 2018
147,5.0,Great day!,We visited with a 6 and 2 year old - Both hada great time - the oldest went on several rides and the little one enjoyed the carousel and playground. It was very busy as it was close to Christmas so we left before taking full advantage of all the rides and activities. We loved the Christmas shows!, December 2018
148,4.0,Feel Like a Kid,"Like a kid in a candy store, there are so many things to see and wanna try and ride. The 'hot air balloon' was amazing. There are performances slotted. You need to check with the Information.Lots of eating places and snack bars too.The attraction outside is simply crowded. If you can endure the cold weather, it is kind of nice. But i expected it to be bigger.", December 2018
149,3.0,Lotte world magic pass - do not buy,"Today is Christmas eve I expected the lotte world will be very crowded therefore I bought the ticket for my kids with unlimited magic pass but when we try to reserve the ride, most of the hot attraction magic pass reservation already closed, it mean you cannot use magic pass for this attraction. End up they need to spend time Q at normal queue. I regret to bough the pass because is not cheap. For my self self I bought 5 times magic pass and now is 5pm and I only manage to use one still has balance 4.", December 2018
150,5.0,Fanstasy,It was wonderful and amazing. I love the place very creative and colourful. My favourite part was the ice skating. The best part was the parade with all the fiction characters., April 2018
151,4.0,Good place for the kids to play the whole day,Indoor and outdoor theme park. Good for cold weather as you can just do the indoor rides. The museum on location is definitely worth a visit as well. Hidden gem. Quiet as most of crowd would be at the theme park. There are several eateries at the exit of the museum.  The eatery closest to the entrance of shopping mall offers cheap and good food as compared to the other eateries on the same floor. It is small and looks less expensive .. food is good value for money., December 2018

154,2.0,Very average! ,"Unless you‚Äôre really desperate to spend money on any average theme park, don‚Äôt go. The rides and premises feels old and tattered. The crowds are packed and the queues are crazy long (2 hours) for a short unexciting roller coaster ride. It‚Äôs also small with limited attractions. We were bored stiff despite spending a fortune on the entrance fee.", December 2018
155,1.0,Avoid,"Very disappointed.   Expensive, a lot of attractions closed and the best attractions cost extra, which is outrageous considering the high entry fee.   Even the ice skating rink required everyone to vacate after only 10 minutes.   Overrated, overcrowded and totally over the most disappointing theme park our family has visited, and we have been to many.   We lost on Lotte.", December 2018
156,4.0,Get the Fast Pass to enjoy to the Max!,"Went on a Wednesday morning but it was so packed with Korean teenagers, many in school uniform. It makes me wonder if that was a school excursion or it is a trend to visit theme Parks in school uniforms. We reached there exactly at 9.30am and when the doors were opened, teenagers starting sprinting towards the rides and queues began to form. Not intending to wait too Long for rides, we each paid 40000 won for the 5 rides express pass. The counter for express pass is located behind the famous Carousel ride. A paper band will be tied around your wrist. Just show the band to the personnel at the express ride queue and they will mark on the wrist band. Choose to use the wrist band wisely. Some rides have queues that move quite fast. Eg the pirate ship ride which allows 60 riders or more per rid, so one should not use the wrist band here. The express pass is really useful for rides that have queues up to 1h Long. Atlantis and French Revolution have Super Long queues and these are reall high intensity fun rides! Use your express pass here! Gyro Swing is another ride which has ridiculously Long queue. Don‚Äôt forget to go to level 2/3 where there is a photography area with many feature walls to take nice instragammable photos", December 2018
157,4.0,Strange place. Fun park.,"Very strange place, but a fun time had overall. Initially when entering the park, the place seems very small. All of the big attractions aren't immediately visible. Take a few minutes to locate all of the major rides/attractions inside and outside of the park. Some of the lines can be very long, but hey, most theme parks are. The indoor section looks very dated and there aren't as many spectacular rides. Roller coasters are a blast. Lots of food options too! There is enough to see for an entire day so plan ahead. Not a bad option for a day at a theme park.", September 2018
158,3.0,Too many people (students) hence longer queues,"Went on a Thursday, some rides were undergoing maintenance (DO CHECK THE APP/WEBSITE BEFORE GOING, the rides which were down were some of the main rides), long queues for the comet express & french revolution (>100 mins), there is the magic pass app where you get to try your luck to get an express pass at a specific time slot (you can do it at the kiosk too) The day I went, there were many students there making it crowded - almost 90% were students which was really different from my Everland experience.Food selection was decent, it's not super big, but its good, and the location is still in the city which makes it convenient, and it's near lotte mart for food shopping", November 2018
159,4.0,Moderate theme park,"The theme park is not big but it has all the rides and facilities. Most rides are for older child with height more than 110cm. We spent some time studying the  floor maps because the signage was not very clear. It was long queue during winter. We tried to use the magic pass but some rides did not accept the pass. Anyway, all of us were having great fun there. The parade was not very interesting. We were confused about the direction to get there initially because the area was a combination of mall, hotel and park. No signage to show us how to go to theme park from sunway. The exit of the subway is 1 or 2. And the park was located near the food departmental store.", December 2018
160,1.0,"Too busy, not enough open","Because of the weather the ride numbers are very reduced, leaving you with not much to do and very very long lines. Do not visit here in winter wait for the warm weather", December 2018
161,3.0,Cool,"Though I don't ride all the rides, I just embraced the view and surrounding, a moment when you wish you are young again. I don't think is as big as Everland that I heard of bring a huge place, but since here, the location is great and accessible by using metro when you do not have enough time while in Seoul but just enough to experience the moment of being young at heart.", November 2018
162,5.0,Too much fun definitely worth it,I went to Lotte World in October 2018. They have a wide selection of games and activities as well as different restaurants and stores. The quality of service is amazing. I went on a Wednesday or Thursday afternoon and the place was crowded. There are a large selection of private or vip rooms to cater for special occasions and business dinners. Can't wait to go back!, October 2018
163,5.0,Well known facility,"Upon entering the facility it is clearly evident this building offers the full gambit of stores and sporting & eating highlightsWhilst the wife does extensive shopping there are numerous coffee shops, restaurants,  cinemas,, highest lookout in Seoul, aquarium,  play arama  and games facilities , ice skating rink", November 2018
164,4.0,What fun!!! ,"What a fun day at Lotte World! So many rides and lots to see. It is difficult to navigate around. There is so much packed in that you don't see all the rides unless you go down every street and every corner. It is really tough to find the stairs or escalators as well. Lines aren't long but the wait to get on a ride takes forever. They could introduce more efficientcy by counting passengers while the ride runs and limiting the number of Magic Passes allowed on a ride. We went on a Monday and not a super busy day, but wait times were 45-60 for the more popular rides.", November 2018
165,5.0,Omg,Actually everything there is amazing but the problem is all the time crowded and alot of people special after 12 pm but in weekend from when lotte world open until close they accept millions of people to much people and if you need to play sometimes you need to wating like one hour for one game or 2 hour i just suggest to visit there but in weekdays spical in middle of the week, November 2018
166,4.0,Quick-Wit-Tedness,"Lotte World is one of the most interesting places in Korea. We can also say Korean's Disney land. It places in Jamsil station of line 2. Since I was young, I went there and I also went there with my friends. Sometimes, I visited there from the school field trip. Mostly there are a lot of people that is why you should be quick-wittedness. We normally say we need to win on the quick-wittedness game which means that we need to go there when there are fewer people. Anyway, it would be good for you to enjoy Korea's amusement park. By the way, as every amusement is, prices are not that kind.", February 2018

One day is just sufficient to enjoy The place.", November 2018
175,4.0,Huge park that'll need more than a day,My kids were a little young to enjoy the rides fully (3 & 5 years old). The park attendants are quite strict on the minimum height restrictions. Older kids would definitely enjoy more. It has both an indoor and outdoor section so was good for the colder months., November 2018
176,4.0,A world in it's own -,The 'Lotte World' in Seoul is an Amusement Park in it's own. If you like water activities and other fun amusement it is worth spending time there. As it is not cheap you should allow time for best 'value for money'., May 2018
177,4.0,Great for kids,We went here with a young infant so didn‚Äôt explore outside as none of the rides would be suitable for our baby. Being indoors meant that we could still go there even though it was a rainy day. Lots to do at Lotte World. There are lots of restaurants and lots of shopping opportunities. I would recommend coming here with young kids although it can get very busy., October 2018
178,4.0,Crowds galore,"It‚Äôs a fantastic place if you‚Äôre travelling with older kids. There‚Äôs a whole floor for younger kids which we only found later in the afternoon. Queues were crazy on the Friday we visited due to school-going kids of all ages. So if you‚Äôre really keen on getting on the rides on a Friday or weekend, do check it they sell fast passes. But definitely do avoid Fridays and weekends if you can. We went back to Lotte World for Pororo Park on Thursday and it was really rather quiet so do consider going on a weekday!", October 2018

180,5.0,Great Service And Care From Hotel Staff (Especially From the Club Lounge),"I was unwell right at the start of my two week's working trip in Seoul. Upon knowing of my condition since 13 Oct 2018, the Club Lounge staff had been very concerned each time they see me, and during breakfasts, would recommend what to drink and eat to better manage the condition of my extreme throat inflammation. Specifically on the 13 Oct 2018 morning, the two Club Lounge staff had helped to find the nearest clinic for me upon request and followed up with me on their own accord an hour later if I was going to the clinic. Another special mention would be the male lobby senior staff who, upon my inquiry of direction, brought me to the clinic for fear I might find it difficult to locate. Very thankful for the concern and dedication of the hotel staff during my visit to Korea this time. Grateful to have made the acquaintance of the hotel staff.

Do not pay the full price if you decide to go. Use sites like Trazy or Klook and get your discount passes. (foreign passport holders only). The kids had a fun time but for adults not so much.  The only saving grace for us was that we did get some nice photos of the kids.  Also, do go early and avoid weekends/holidays if you can.", September 2018
185,4.0,A fun theme park!,"Sweet little theme park that is not overblown. Good for kids, big kids and adults who are kids inside. Great way to enjoy a day.Lotte World theme park is not overly crowded. Most rides will require about 30-50mins++ to line up for. Indoor activities are quite numerous but are aimed at younger audiences. Be warned, some 4D rides can get you very dizzy. Outside is fun but can get colder at night. No extreme thrill rides such as a crazy roller coaster and some rides are notin operation. App/Web is not updated about status.They have some theme (halloween) but arent as committed as other parks. Lotte mascots are not as relatable to foreigners.", October 2018

Got some tickets online (with a massive discount) the night before, collection was easy. Was pretty amazed by the spectacle of the whole site really, rides are designed for kids rather than adults but we found the outside ones a but more adult. Very much enjoyed our day but it was very busy with long lines for all rides. Food and drink was farely priced considering it is a theme park.

When they returned, they refused to let my hubby boarded the ride, and simply showed us a card that we cant cut queue. In the end, they only allowed my MIL to go up. Separately, we were queueing behind for the second cabin. I asked if they allowed my hubby to join us. again they refused. I told them 4-5 persons are allowed and we only have 4 persons here. And the same reason, we are not supposed to cut queue. Nothing fanastic about their rides + bad service. For Singaporean or Malaysian who are visiting Seoul, my advise is you can give this amusement park a miss. Personally Prefer disneyland and Universal studio.", September 2018
190,1.0,"3 rides in 5 hours, extremely boring","Was really disappointed with this. It looks good but that's about it. All the rides indoors are for young children, despite waiting in lines for 30 mins filled with teens and adults. The outside rides are proper rides but a 2 min ride doesn't really seem worth lining up half an hour. For tourists, if you have limited time I wouldn't recommend this, English is also a bit limited here.", September 2018
191,5.0,Crowded but good nonetheless,"So i went on a friday and it was very crowded with a kids in school visits but the rides on the outdoor are the best for adults , if you have kids and want them to have some fun go indoor.The lines in the outdoor are long and tiring however the rides are very enjoyable.You are advised to go from tuesday to thursday if you want to avoid crowds and also avoid public holidays at all costs.", September 2018

193,4.0,Busy but fun,"i rally wanted to go to lotte world when i was in Seoul and when i did i didn't regret it, it was magical and fun. it was very busy but it was near Christmas so it was expected and i did go on a weekend there were very long lines for rides and we only managed to go on 3, but they were well worth the wait.the food was really yummy we had some of the food off the stands and went to the Korean restaurant in the magical kingdom are both were really delicious. beacuse the rides were so busy we decided to go and do all of the 3D rides which were so much fun!  there we 4 or 5 i think they were only 5/10 minutes or so long but so good!overall i would recommend people to go to lotte world just not on the weekend or at peak times!", December 2017

195,5.0,World class theme park,"Lotte world was one of the best indoor/outdoor theme park we‚Äôve been. It has so much to offer for persons of all ages. Rides indoors are more for the kids while rides outdoors are for the extremes. 1 day is not enough. Its situated in the city of seoul. other places near it was the lotte mall, lotte aquarium and lotte tower the highest in S.korea and 5th in the world.", September 2018
196,5.0,Excellent customer service,I spend 1 week at the lotte World hotel Jasmine location.The hotel is extremely clean but what makes this hotel stand out is their staff ... one of the best customer service I received ... especially if you meet Rain and Suzie who worked at the executive club... They went above and behind to make my stay an excellent one..also location location location 1 minute walking to the subway...I will defiantly rate this hotel 4.5 stars...Kansameda lotte staff!!, September 2018

198,4.0,Enjoy it both indoor and outdoor,"We decided to go to Lotte World since we visited South Korea during Summer time. We were informed that this amusement park had an indoor and outdoor area so we could just choose which area we would like to check.Once inside the indoor park, you wouldn‚Äôt feel you are inside an amusement park, instead a shopping mall for the children! Haha true enough, it was airconditioned, which was very helpful during Summer time. There were a lot of rides and entertainment there but we just didn‚Äôt have the time to experience it all. We went inside the Fantasy Forest (if i remember it correctly), which btw, you would have to pay extra 2,000 KRW to enter, since our ticket didn‚Äôt mention that it was included. No worries though since my 2 year old son loved seeing the various animals that were inside. I think adults and kids alike, would love to spend an entire day here since you could actually find a lot of rides and things to do here.", August 2018
199,3.0,Still Fun,Lotte world is good for Kids at heart .. Still fun but if you been to universal or disneyland you will be disappointed..Good thing with Lotte world though is mall is just right there too with a bunch of places to shop for .. But entrace is quite expensive if you buy there in the spot find some cheap ticket online..Food wise its good theres various selection.Jamsil station is right there as well and they have lockers on the train station .., September 2018
200,5.0,Love love love it,"Even though I'm not a child, I loved it, great place to take kids, lotto world is located inside a shopping mall so theres always plenty of things to do, it has alot of rides, shows and food, i do recommand to see lotto world especially if you have kids.", September 2018
201,3.0,Faded and Dated Elegance,"Lotte is a well-known chain in Korea, and its hotels have a somewhat formulaic uniformity. Lotte World has a rather dated feel and look - it was probably the bees knees twenty or thirty years ago, but doesn't seem to have moved with the times.The staff during my stay were impeccable - polite and efficient, if rather lacking in warmth. My double room was comfortable, functional, and equipped with the sort of items that one needs and expects in a hotel of this level, but faded. The wallpaper and carpet looked as though they should have been changed years ago, and the shower over the bath tub was a Heath-Robinson arrangement. The corridor carpets were equally in need of changing, and the space was pervaded by a musty smell, that may be a legacy of the days when smoking was common in the corridors and rooms.I didn't think much of the dining options: a Chinese place on a high floor (which I didn't try) and a buffet place on the second floor (which I did). The hotel lacks a simple coffee shop type restaurant where one can order a simple dish from a menu.There are plenty of better hotel options in Seoul.", September 2018
202,5.0,Great view from the top,"Had a chance to see the view from the 120th floor of Lotte World.  I can only say, it‚Äôs amazing and worth the experience.Entrance fee is 27,000 korean won and you‚Äôll get the chance to experienced the fastest ride of your life on a double floor elevator.  It only took a minute for us to reached 120th floor.Not to be missed.", September 2018

204,5.0,Kids heaven!! ,"Visited one weekday in December but I guess it was school holidays, it was so so crowded. The kids went crazy at this place, lots of kids ride and the queue was long for each activity. We spent one full day here. We did not play the outdoor activities as it was freezing cold. Hope to pay this place a visit soon!", December 2017
205,4.0,Sensational ,"Besides waiting 2.5 hours in a line up for a roller coaster wearing virtual reality goggles, the first thing we did getting off the ride was get back in line for a further 3 hours to do it again. It was a memorable time but allow yourself a full day.", August 2018
206,4.0,Much better than expected.,"This place provided for a fun day for our family. The key is to get the ‚ÄúFree Pass‚Äù ( Premium Pass ). This allows you to cut to the front of the line and, unlike the Magic Pass, it is unlimited and there is no need to make reservations using the app. At 100,000 Won it is not cheap, so we purchased just for the kids‚Äî they are now raving about Lotte World. Otherwise, I think the long lines (hour or more at times) would have seriously interfered with the fun.It is also a good idea to get to Lotte World early as the atmosphere is calmer and not as crowded.", August 2018
207,4.0,Lotte World South Korea,This is an indoor theme park which is good for kids aged 4-11 years old.. Half a day will be enough.., October 2017
208,4.0,Indoor small version of Disneyland ,"Very crowded on the weekend. My 6 years old did enjoyed it as we changed plan from a private city tour to half city, half Lotte world day because it was too hot to walk around palaces and other tourist spots. I felt the indoor amusement park could have been cooler but with the outside heat and too many peoples inside made the AC seem it wasn‚Äôt working well. Lines are long, minimum 30+ minutes wait. Wish I bought the magic pass, that could of save us lots of time. Final thought: been there done that and will not come back.", August 2018
209,4.0,Decent theme park but not super exciting,"We arrived about 15 minutes before opening on a hot Wednesday morning. We ran first for the Atlantis coaster (one of the most popular rides at Lotte World) and after our ride the line was already very long. Other attractions include several more coasters including a virtual reality one called French Revolution, a monorail, and an ice skating rink. The rest of the park was also enjoyable although eventually we got bored and left at around 4 pm. This park is not recommended for thrill seekers, rather it is best for families, couples, and high school groups.", July 2018

215,5.0,Amazing,The place is massive. Would recommend to get a vip pass so you do not have to wait in line. The rides are expectacular. They got both outdoor and indoor rides. I would say people at different age will enjoy this place. There are rides that the kids will enjoy and there are rides for the thrill seeker as well. Lots of restaurant and food stalls to choose from., February 2018
216,3.0,Good but not a Disney/Universal,Good amusement park and the best thing is that most of it is indoors. So you can enjoy irrespective of weather conditions. But seems to have become old and charges additional for certain attractions. Fireworks are indoors as well and are not comparable to what one would see in say Disney., August 2018

We stayed in Myeongdong and Busan first before transfering here. As expected everything is still in tip top condition. Everything is accessible. Train, restaurants, 711, malls and even lotte world which is my kids favorite place to be. Staffs were polite and helpful. Will still be back here on our next trip to Seoul.", May 2018
218,4.0,Well presented theme park with a twist of latest technology.,Disney meets asia with this gem.From water slides to roller coasters along with a massive ice skating ring this little commercial gem will not disappoint.

224,5.0,Great olace,This was a great place to take our kids 9 & 13. There‚Äôs 4 floors of rides and games. There‚Äôs also a lot of fun thrilling rides outside the building that kids and adults will have fun on. We spent about 8 hours here just playing games and ice skating., July 2018
225,2.0,Too expensive,"We are not users of theme or amusement parks so not up on the pricing, but took my kids for our sons birthday. Getting in the door is what you pay for with the entry ticket. Rides cost extra - every single one. While reach ride doesn't cost a fortune it would soon add up if your kids are adventurous. I left feeling totally ripped off. Should have researched it better.", July 2018
226,3.0,Huge theme park,there are lots of things to do at this theme park.  it is very loud by my standards.  but  also a must see experience.  I wish ice skating was included., July 2018
227,5.0,Great hotel to have business or for leisure - tax refund people need to be polite,"I have stayed here at least 5-6 times and every time the staff in the hotel, at the club lounge are excellent.Great service, always smiling, positive feelings for guests. The manager and his team are very friendly and helpful. Rooms are nice and quiet with molten brown amenities. Same old nice touch with no reduction in quality - always of a high standard.Breakfast and the evening snacks are superb. High quality food always.Kloud beer bar at the basement is also very nice and not overly priced.Location is super as you have a subway Jamsil station and a super mall beside and the new 123 floor little observation tower.Only gripe is the tax refund people - not part of the hotel - are rude. The young lady needs some training to be more polite to tourists who pay your salary and reason for your job. If you are still rude to such tourists, who are your customers, then you will be out of a job. Be nice. I don‚Äôt owe you money and I can return your tax if you feel that you deserve it.

231,5.0,Convenient nice hotel! A bit expensive though. ,"Hotel Lotte was a bit old but very well maintained. The character room gave good excitement to my sons; 6 & 8, especially due to its Wii. Service is also excellent. I emailed them in advance to enquire about the beds since I only managed to book non-suite character room with 2 twin beds but they helped me to get a room with a queen bed and a single bed with trundle, which is exactly what I need. The location is indeed convenient from the Lotte theme park which is in the mall next door with a connecting passage. Price is on the high side but with all benefits above, it's quite worth it. Will come back again", August 2017
232,4.0,South Korea‚Äôs Disneyworld,"This is an ok theme park. Appreciated that there is an indoor area when the weather gets too hot or rainy during the summer season. Went on a Friday and was quite surprised that the queues were not that long. Though the park was quite big, I find that there are more things to do at Everland. Enjoyed the street and stage performances throughout the day. The food choices are ok. Would have been better if the park access includes the skating rink area as I believe it costs extra to try out.", June 2018
233,5.0,Great indoor theme park ,"We spent the whole day in this theme park with 4 kids under 6, 2 seniors and 4 adults. Had a great time enjoying the Lotte theatre shoe, the samba parade which was the current theme and the many rides.There's also a outdoor extension to Magic land. Very decent rides there; I played the bungee and gyro drop. Queue was manageable except for the few games that everyone garners for: Atlantis at Magic land looks like the most popular and Aeronaut's hot air balloon and flume ride were also popular.Otherwise , we had an enjoyable experience with a day at the park.", July 2018
234,4.0,We had a good time!,"I don't know why people say the queues are so bad they could hardly ride!We went early in the morning and went on the French Revolution twice without queuing for more than 5 mins (bad idea cos one can get really dizzy on that ride)I recommend going for Atlantis for your first ride as that ride is by far the most popular. Queue was 40 min or so but if you buy the magic pass from klook you can breeze straight to the front and beat the queue. If you wish, you can use all your magic passes here (prob the best cos the other queues are not as long as this)We bought 5 magic passes. We went on every single ride, French Revolution 3x, Atlantis 3 or 4x, gyro spin, swing, drop a couple of times, Conquistador 4x.If you download the app you can get some free magic passes (these are timed and released every hour) and you could use these for the less popular rides. We never managed to use the free app magic passes for the popular ones cos they were always sold out so we gave up.Enjoy yourselves! The queues are not that bad! But please go early!", June 2018
235,5.0,A great experience,"A good place people must visit, there is everything from food, groceries, restaurants, electronic, audio, white goods, good quality garments etc. etc..During the visit I was lucky because there was 50% discount on garments like Zara and others, even on sport garments.", July 2018
236,4.0,Great for traveling with friends,"There are the indoor and outdoor park.I suggest you buy the ticket online (e.g. Klook) before your visit as you can get cheaper price and some package promo (theme park + aquarium + magic pass, etc).Magic passes are very useful to avoid long queue at famous attractions. Grab a map from the information counter to make the most out of your visit.This place took a long time to explore especially if you plan out on trying out rides.Visited here to try the most adrenaline pumping rides (INDOOR: The Conquistador, French Revolution - with VR option, OUTDOOR: Gyro Spin, Gyro Swing, Gyro Drop, the Atlantis). If you have little kids, they will also enjoy merry go round, shows and parades, and other kids-friendly attractions. The 4D Wild Series (indoor) is also very fun and can be enjoyed by all.For cultural buff, they also have the Folk Museum that is not crowded at all (as people prefer the rides) where you can see miniatures and artefacts from the many eras of the Korean peninsula.Places to eat are mostly restaurants and some snack stalls.Aquarium is located on separate building.", June 2018
237,5.0,Start early to enjoy Lotte World fully ,Lotte World is huge with both indoor and outdoor attractions so do plan to spend the whole day there. The Fly Venture and Upside down wheel were my favourite rides. Stay for the night parade and indoor fireworks - fun for the kids. Nice view from the 'hot air balloon' rides., May 2018
238,4.0,Perfect place for shopping ,I went there with two of my friends. We did a lot of shopping and eating there. Their food court has food from all around the world. Even Korean street food too., June 2018
239,3.0,Why the extra fees??,"Good:It's a nice attraction for families and teenagers. The focus inside is more on smaller kids but outside my teenage girl had lots of fun.The park is in good condition. It looks  very safe and well maintained.Negative:When I pay an entrance fee of 50 USD I don't understand why some of the very simple attractions require an extra payment. I found this very disappointing and a little fraudulent. If your staff is sad and depressed as they look, please don't let them wave always their hands. It looks strange to me if some is waving the hands to me and looking depressed.", June 2018
240,3.0,Just another themepark,"Before I went there, I've read not so good review about this park. Some attraction you have to pay, some are only for toddlers, some are under maintenance. Because it's indoor, I think they have to do the landscape in certain way. This makes the route pretty confusing and lots of stairs (even though there are escalators in main area). The employee looks not so enthusiastic (though not impolite / rude), and not efficient in managing the crowd, which is surprising because Korean are normally quite fast in working. Me and my 2 children normally loves theme park, but this one I give Rating 3 simply because it's indoor, so it's the weather is not hot. There are attraction outside and it's very hot.  I don't complaint that it's hot because I know it's summer, but because there were lack of sitting places with shades / shades while queuing.", June 2018
241,4.0,old park but worth the visit,the park is old you can see it with some of the rides but well maintained a protion is indoor which is wonderful on a sunny day and there is also a outdoor portion where the more extreme and newer ride is located., June 2018
242,5.0,Amazing Shopping Center,"You can kill 2 duck with one shot.Get to Lotte World and you can get to the top at 555m and see Seoul from different angles. Also the entire district around it is one kind ... you'll see it.Also enjoy a complete different shopping experience , good food court even an aquarium if you fancy to submerge.A bit far if you're staying at Seoul downtown but defo it worth it.Don't forget to download Citymaper at your app store and enjoy.", June 2018
243,4.0,my rating would be 3.5!,"We went on a Monday and arrived slightly before 10am.  Stayed right through to 5+pm. Tips : entrance tickets :for foreign visitors, i think its better to purchase the entrance tickets online/before hand - we got our tickets at SGD36 per person (adult or child alike).  redemption is at the south gate -- look for the counter that says overseas admission.  it is not the ticket counter that is outside,  it is located after the main doors.Magic passi contemplated purchasing the tickets that comes with magic pass but decided not too and didn't regret my choice.- as we arrived fairly early on a monday morning - crowds were thin - didn't have to wait more than 15 mins in the morning.- we downloaded the Lotte World App - the app gives u 3 free magic passes per ticketholder! - we managed to redeem 2 of the 3 magic passesCrowd - after 2pm - the crowds started to stream in - and that's when the queue starts to form especially for popular rides like the FLUME ride.- so for the popular rides, u may wish to redeem your magic pass early. we didn't know that and when we tried to redeem our 3rd magic pass in the afternoon for the popular ride -- the reservation has closed.  so please note!overall - my child enjoyed the rides - especially the VR rides and had a fun time - for the price we paid - i thought it was worth it!", June 2018
244,4.0,Indoor and outdoor,Negatives:- Outside lines are long waits which is especially difficult in the freezing winters- There are not that many ridesPositives:- Lotte Market is right outside the amusement park- Some of the rides are very different where they use technology and 4D- There are a variety of rides for people of different ages- Able to spend a whole day at Lotte World, February 2018
245,3.0,Big area but quite empty with limited rides,"Indoor rides are limited as 3 popular rides were closed down with no reason provided. Inconsistent with the staff service as some staff require tourists to present entrance pass documents before getting on the rides. One of the level 2 rides, the staff pushed my son away and dropped him on the ground for refusal entry when the passes were with my hubby in another ride with my daughter. I found this attitude and service quite bad as a two yr-old child was excited for the ride and being treated in this manner. Not as if the ride having long Q. I explained that we will show the pass tickets later after the ride as my child is crying with  disappointment after such treatment.", June 2018

250,3.0,It was fun but queuing up takes forever ,"This theme park has outdoor and indoor area. We went there on weekday and it was super packed with the teenager students whose wearing uniform. Actually not quite sure how the education system here works? But based on my experience not really recommended if you are taking too young kid to this place neither elder due to huge distance also too many floors in the building.It's confusing place as they do not provide the map at the outdoor entrance. We had to figured out on our own at the end of the day we found the entrance from the mall and the map was there, plus no information to inform the tourist if they were busy with a big tour group. We were disappointed with the management team here on careless. Free WiFi here sucks, it doesn't really work mostly unable to connect. Ticket will be cheaper in the afternoon but I don't think I want to be back again, doesn't worth the money.", November 2017

252,5.0,Something for everyone,"We came here late Thursday morning and there was almost no queue at all the rides. Think the crowd came in about 2pm or so, however queue length is still relatively ok at 30-40mins. Generally the indoor parts are for kids and outdoor rides are more older kids or adults. We bought our tickets from the internet and managed to cut the ticket queue, however we still need to exchange for real tickets at the South Gate, and only there. Signage was quite bad and it took us about 15-20 mins to locate it. Within the theme park, again signage can be improved as we find ourselves circling around look for the specific rides. All in all, it was still fun enough for us to go around without lunch for 8 hours. Cannot be compared to Disney or universal studios but good enough for us.", June 2018
253,3.0,Disappointingly small,"Ok if you're from the US like I am and are used to going to big theme parks like Universal studios, six flags, and disneyland, then you're going to be disappointed. If you rarely go to large theme parks, then you'll like lotte world. I really didnt like lotte world because it was so tiny that I could cover the entire amusement park in under 4 hours. I don't know about other countries, but in America, disneyland is so huge that it takes a whole day just to cover one section of the park. Compared to the disneyland in LA, lotte world is like 1/10 the size. It's just so tiny and the rides were not really ""thrilling"" at all. The horror house was literally a 10 minute 3D video for 5 year olds. If you have young kids, then lotte world wouldn't be a bad choice, but if you're over 15 years old, I suggest everland over lotte world.", June 2018
254,4.0,Amusement for all ages,"This amusement is vertically huge, ranges from b3 to 4th floor. It can be very confusing when you first reach there. Be sure to get a copy of the map at the info counter after you enter located at 1st floor. I entered by the south gate and arrived at the 1st floor playground for young children. They cater rides to kids below the height of 100cm and there were variety. If you walk further towards the centre of the theme park on 1st floor, you reached the place where the carousel and viking is. There are other rides on 1st floor for older kids and adults. Most rides height requirement is about 110cm. The more thrilling ones probably above 130cm. 2nd floor leads to the outdoor theme park where most of the thrill rides are. There are also lots of cafes and restaurants on the 2nd floor indoors as well as 2 other adventure rides.3rd floor houses another 3 more adventure rides and 4th floor is where the hot air ballon ride is. Well it‚Äôs really crazily big and we didn‚Äôt have the time to complete all the rides as we were rushing off to the aquarium. Spent a total of 6 hrs there. Study the map, plan your time wisely and you will be able to get on most rides. Magic pass that helps skip queues save time. But sometimes the queue for magic pass can also be quite long for popular rides.Comparatively, I prefer everland as it is an outdoor theme park and there is a zoo within the park itself. Also it is easier to locate the rides in everland.", June 2018
255,4.0,No Lines,"Admittedly, I'm not sure if we got lucky or whatever, but it was a Tuesday. There were kids on their field trip there but despite that? there were no lines. Majority of it is indoors with a train that goes around the indoor area and around the outdoor area, too. That said? it was rather fun, and this coming from a guy that doesn't particularly enjoy  theme parks. Just be aware that the B3 entertainments with the VR and ice skating? know that those do NOT come with your entrance, so don't be surprised if you need to pay extra for those.", May 2018

Find the signed that show Lotto World Adventure. There are outdoor and indoor. Weather was hot so we stayed indoor first. There are rides for whole family as well as children. The waiting time can be up to an hour. kids enjoyed the day.", June 2018
257,2.0,Nothing special. Just a regular amusement park in the center of the City.,"Just a regular amusement park in the city. The waiting lines for the rides are very long.

Considering that Korea is an IT advanced country, this is just an old amusement park.", June 2018
258,3.0,It was good but expensive,"This theme park was good in many ways, but expensive for what you get. It honestly reminded me of when Pinocchio's carnival went bad. Something is just a little bit off with this theme park. Green monkeys, people in mascarade masks, strange performances. . . The rides are kind of fun but be prepared to wait a while in the hot indoor area. We paid extra to ice skate and that was fun for the kids. All in all this park was bizarre. It's like a strange knock off of Disneyland.", June 2018

261,4.0,Rushed,"We went with a guided tour, so we were pressed for time. We only managed 3 rides. There is something for everyone, like the Aeronauts Balloon Ride( to see the ""city"",) a ""hot-air balloon"" ride for younger kids. Older kids can go to the Tomb of Death and Pharaoh's Fury(find the hidden treasure). Younger kids can also enjoy the Jumping Fish(escape the shark;jump vigoursly at corners) and boat rides. There is limited space in the fishes in the Jumping Fish ride, so parents who want to accompany their kids, beware of your knees. There are three bumper cars, one for kids, the other for children taller than 140cm. Both only seat one person, and for the kid one , parents are not allowed. The average wait there is 25 mins, while a ride is approximately anywhere between 6 - 20mins. The Lotte Aquarium is a short walk away, and Lotte Hotel is just outside, perfect for families with kids as kidzania is a stone's throw away. Overall awesome, will come again.", June 2018
262,3.0,Complicated place which needs some planning,"Overall the visit was ok. It was a little overwhelming at first as the place had the outdoor portion and indoor part with four levels. There was also poor description of the rides, hence, you had no idea what to expect for some of the indoor rides. This place has quite a bit of height restrictions for kids 5-6 years old. So if you‚Äôre below 110cm, you basically cannot take most of the rides even though if the kid is game for it. The kid would have to take the really baby rides. Good to do some research before heading to the park.", June 2018

I really didn't wanna waste my precious time waiting in the middle of crowd waiting for some popular ride for like an hour and half.

Lotte is not a Korean enterprise(actually it's more like Japanese company).2. It's hard to find any employee who can speak English fluently.3. There are not enough space for visitors to hide from sun ray on the 'magic island'.4. Don't go there on the weekend.5. Foods are expensive and crappy in Lotte world. 6. There are only few rides for guys s who seek real fun.E.g)'Atlantis', 'Zyro Swing' 7. Ask your Korean friend how to enjoy fun pleasantly there. YOU DON'T WANT TO GO THERE UNPREPARED.", May 2018
264,2.0,just a amusement park with rides,feels just a normal amusement park with rides. nothing fantastic.

265,5.0,What a range!,Lotte's department stores are incredible with up to 17 floors of every type of merchandise you could wish for. It is not only a store but a real experience with marvellous facilities for keeping families amused whilst bargain hunting. British department stores could really benefit from seeing how these work, May 2018
266,5.0,Great for All Ages!!! Must See!,"This place is like Disneyland on steroids. It has both rides indoors and out, which is great incase it rains.It‚Äôs also located inside Lotte Mall, arguably the greatest mall in existence. There‚Äôs a Hard Rock Cafe here, and many different shops and even exhibits to see. There‚Äôs even an aquarium.Lotte world itself is great. Some of the best and crazies rides I‚Äôve ever been on. Definitely recommend getting one of their waffle sandwiches (waffles, cream, and fruit sauce, I recommend apple!) located outside near the Drop of Doom-type ride. Great options for food. Great for vegetarians and vegans. The Panda Express just inside (as you‚Äôre coming in from the outside portion it should be on your right) has a tofu stir fry.", May 2018
267,4.0,JAM-Packed. ,"This place is full of people. Waiting time goes from 60mins to (240mins for French Revolution VR). It is a very tiring day of waiting as most theme parks are.My tip will be to download their MagicPass app. Go to setting and change the language. Register your tickets. For us we had 3 magic passes included with our tickets. Then from there you can book your magic pass for 3 rides. You can also view the waiting time for the rides real time. Sadly, for us, we figured this out when we were in the middle of our visit, so all schedules were filled.", May 2018

269,5.0,Lotta fun!,"I have been to many theme parks around the world, but i had a lot of fun in Lotte World, even though the rides are not extreme at all. Its just a fun place in general and something different to do when you are not busy doing all the cultural activities. We ended up going after 4pm to take advantage of the cheaper tickets as we didn't think we needed a whole day anyway. We spent around 5 hours here during a weekday and we managed to visit all the main rides (although one or two rides were out of service). The only problem we had was that we enjoyed trying to cram in as many rides as possible, that by the time we finished up, we realised the park was closing and all food and snack shops were closing up. You wont need more than 5 hours here in this park and its very easy to reach by MRT. And also, just take note, around 8pm there is a parade that happens inside which is quite cool, but it means a lot of the rides will close down for the duration of this 20-30 minute parade.", April 2018

271,1.0,Every ride was out of order! ,"We reached there at around 2pm and wanted to stay till the night as the park opens late for that day. The day has been gloomy thus, we have already expected all outdoor attractions to be closed. Upon reaching, we saw that most attractions had queues of 80min and up. We proceeded to utilize the magic pass mobile app in hopes to snag a magic pass however the app was loading the whole time and could not even get us to the landing page. We went on to walk around the premises to see if there were attractions with shorter queue. As we walked on, the app finally loaded and we checked on waiting time to see a few attractions 0-15min wait. Upon rushing it, were we told that the ride was under maintenance which was why the app reflected such a short waiting time. The park had similar naming rides that we rushed in order to make it in time for the magic pass only to know that we were at the wrong location. After an hour or so, we so frustrated by what's happening that we went to the customer service counter to see what else Lotte World could offer. We were shocked to know that at the point of our query, only a total of 8 rides (and they were all kiddie attractions) or lesser were available as all the others were under maintenance! I can't imagine heading into a theme park and wanting out so badly due to what is happening. We were there for 3hours, 1 hour was spent on lunch and the remaining 2 was spent finding and getting rejected from rides. The good thing out of the whole situation, we managed to get on 1 ride which we thought were for adults but nope it wasn't.", November 2017
272,5.0,FUN!,"Tips: *Book in advanced*Get a ‚ÄúMagic Pass‚Äù to skip the long queue. you still need to fall in line though but magic pass holders are kind of priority.*Be there early!

273,4.0,Great day out,A great day out with kids lots of rides for kids over 120cm and a fair few where you have to be over 150cm. The place was rather busy even on a weekday there seems to be a lot of school excursions at the park. There were a lot of eateries to choose from and involves a lot of walking so comfortable shoes are recommended. They also had a parade happening which was quite exciting to watch and have a big ice skating ring. We purchased our tickets online which had to be redeemed from the south gate which was a small walk before we could enter.Overall a good day out for kids guess it's Seoul's answer to Disneyland., April 2018

I visit there on Monday expecting little less people than the weekend, but there was so many people üòû, so each ride takes long waiting (of course).

Like some people who don‚Äôt mind paying a bit extra for ‚Äúfast passes‚Äù, we paid for extra ‚ÄúMagic Passes‚Äù. But using them proved impossible. You have to download their app to make ‚Äúreservations‚Äù. These reservations close every time the very few slots have been allocated. For a first timer with young family, we did not realize that we need to literally ‚Äústalk‚Äù the app every 15 mins to secure those precious slots. And for one reason or another, the navigation is super unintuitive for the first couple of times. Since the slots are gone literally 3 seconds after each time period opens, it‚Äôs a race of fast fingers.Of our couple of hours there, we couldn‚Äôt get on that many.

291,2.0,An Average Amusement Park (at best),"I had heard that Lotte World is one of the busiest amusement parks in the world (apart from Disney and Universal Studios parks). So we decided to visit it.  Honestly, it's not a good amusement park. I would advise people to not go. I have not been to Everland, but surely it can't be worse. The only reason I can think that Lotte World is busy is that it is in the city centre area beside 3 or 4 big shopping malls, so I guess people who are around find it convenient to visit. But I can't imagine anyone going for more than 1 visit. And I don't recommend that anyone visit it even once.The indoor part of Lotte World feels like a bunch of mediocre amusement park rides have been shoved into a shopping mall on 3-4 floors. Making matters worse, there is a bit of a bad smell around the space. We went on a few rides in the indoor part (a dinosaur shooting one and a flight simulator one) - they were somewhat copies of Disneyland rides, but not even 1/4 as good. The outside area of Lotte World was not very big, connected via a bridge over the highway. There is a castle in the middle (copy of disneyland), and the main ""thrill"" rides seemed to be the rides that either go from side to side (like a ricking ship ride) or that spin. We didn't go in tot the haunted house as I read a review to avoid it. We went on a Monday and the wait for those average-looking ""thrill"" rides was 40 minutes. Those rides remind me of old-stlye travelling amusement parks that go to various cities with basic rides. Really there is not much more than that, from what we could see, at Lotte World.It was a real letdown. We left very early.", March 2018

However, we really really had fun in Lotte cause there are plenty of rides which look cool. Plus, the happiest thing was that we got discount 20% of one-day Free Pass Ticket via Visit Korea Mastercard. We thought that the ticket price is a bit expensive honestly, but my friend found the link of Visit Korea Mastercard so we could get 20% off. How cool! We used the ticket as much as we can.
