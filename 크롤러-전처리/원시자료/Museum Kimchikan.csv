0,5.0,Kimchi the best,Very nice place to explain history of traditional Korean cuisine I would never believe before how many kimchi kind of combination existing in Korea. If you like it try to find time and visit it, September 2019
1,5.0,Underrated and fun experience,"I don’t understand why this place doesn’t have higher ratings.Tucked away at the 4th floor of a hidden building in Insadong area, this Kimchi museum is in the vicinity of very chill artsy vibe. I signed up for the Kimchi making class and it was really fun to make your own kimchi with the various ingredients such as plum sauce, garlic, ginger, anchovies sauce provided. You even get to bring your kimchi creation home! The exhibits, though not very extensive, were obviously done with a lot of love and gives the visitor a comprehensive guide to Korea’s favourite export. I spent a very lovely afternoon there and wished I could have stayed longer. There is even a tasting room for us to taste kimchi! Overall it was a very memorable experience for me, and I highly recommend anyone who visits Korea to go.", November 2019
2,5.0,A must while visiting Insadong!,"If you're a kimchi fan or if you'd like to learn more about Korea's heritage. stop at this quaint museum. A better visit would've been taking a kimchi cooking class. Insadong has so many great shops, boutiques & snack vendors.", June 2019
3,3.0,Planning ahead would make it more interesting,"So... I knew I wanted to take my family here (for the love of Kimchi) however, did not schedule the visit in advance.  The museum is about halfway along the main Insadong street on the fourth floor of ""Insadong Maru"" (several interesting little shops and some restaurants in this building).  The museum is on three floors - elevator service is available.  The first floor (4F) has an interesting exhibition, an interactive ""Scientists Laboratory"", and a little game where you can make kimchi virtually (children loved it).  The second floor (5F) was mostly books, media - videos and photos, and a small cafe that was closed.  The third floor (6F) has UNESCO cultural heritage items - pretty interesting - an art area (winner for the 4yo) and a place for a cooking class (need to schedule ahead for this).  Entry for adults is 5,000 won each, 8-18y 3,000, and 3-7y 2,000 won for individual entry (Tuesday - Sunday 1000-1800).  In order to take part in the cooking or other interactive encounters you must schedule in advance.  Overall the museum was fairly underwhelming, especially when there is so much to see in this city or even just in Insadong.  The cooking class may have made it more worth the time.  A little disappointed - I had more fun exploring grocery stores or local markets and can get the history in museums with more to offer.", July 2019
4,2.0,Not what we expected,There was literally nothing.  Some picture of kimchi. Some kimchi tasting and interactive game.We are excited for this visit however upon arrival everything change. There was no kimchi making class on the day of our visit.We were given a ticket and thats it no explanatory on what to expect etc..If you guys have free time and money to waste then please visit. If not dont bother. Better visit the Kimchi Academy in Myeong Dong., April 2019
5,5.0,Love it,Finding out about koreas traditional food like kimchi. Well worth goin to this. Slightly difficult to find but its fun to adventure out. Like looking for a hidden treasure. Plus side you can taste different type of kimichi, November 2018
6,4.0,If you love Kimchi...,My son is a lifelong devotee of Kimchi. We absolutely had to visit this museum. (Who would guess there would be a museum devoted exclusively to Kimchi? But there is in Seoul!) Very interesting with several activities for children to participate in. There is even a large kitchen where they offer Kimchi making courses for children and adults. So many displays and information throughout the museum about the history of this unique dish and also shows how it has impacted the world. Excellent visit for people who love Kimchi. And very enlightening for those of us who would rather not eat it but are accompanying our children who had this as their #1 attraction in Seoul!, September 2018
7,5.0,All you ever wanted to know about Kimchi....and more!,"one of the best, small museums we've ever been to.Amazing how such a side dish / side topic could be presented in such an exciting way.Great exhibition design work, activating all the senses, kids and adults would enjoy and profit from it.", August 2018
8,4.0,Kimchi – Korea's National Treasure,"The Kimchikan Museum is where you can turn to for all of your kimchi learning needs.It is the only Korean museum dedicated to kimchi history and to the process of kimchi making – kimjang (the annual autumn kimchi- making season, is a major event on the Korean social calendar), which was designated  as UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

Its not a decorative item. Its where they keep their kimchi.Kimchi Festivals:If you visit Korea during the first week of November go visit their Kimchi Festival in Seoul. Or Gwangju World Kimchi Culture Festival during May, September and November.", August 2017
9,4.0,Cultural Impact of a Food,"Very interesting to see everything from the science of fermentation to the ways different regions' kimchi differ. Also a nice tasting, but that wasn't anything to write home about.", December 2017
10,4.0,Kimchi!,"This quaint museum in Insadong is dedicated to kimchi. Adult admission is $8USD. It isn't terribly big, so you can pretty much get through it in about an hour. My husband and I went on a Friday afternoon, and there was literally no one else there. There are a couple of kimchi documentaries that play in two different rooms, two or three interactive activities, kimchi artifacts, and hanbok garments you can try on for free. I really enjoyed the taste tasting room where you can sample three different types of kimchi, which you can only enter by scanning your admission ticket. There was also a kimchi making room, but you have to set that up with the front desk. Overall, it's a nice play to wander if you wanna wind down after walking through Insadong.", January 2018
11,4.0,Nice Museum in Insadong,"Great Museum to learn more about Kimchi. Tickets are not too expensive (2500won/pax) and overall the museum was quite interesting with kimchi tasting! You can also sign up kimchi making experience on the spot, but better to reserve. Free Hanbok Experience, as with many other museums in Korea.", December 2017
12,3.0,Good to bring kids there,"The museum located in one of the alleys in Insadong.  It is a small museum that show you various kinds of kimchi and how they are made.  There are videos, photos, stamps, and other fun activities.  On the top floor, you even get to taste a few different type of kimchi.Admission is required (I think it is 10000W).  You can spend a couple of hours there and kids will like it.If you visit Insadong and your schedule is not tight, it's good to have a visit.  Otherwise you don't have to come all the way to see it.", October 2017
13,2.0,Very small museum,"Super Super Super small museum. You can check out the museum in less than 15 minutes. Admission fee 5,000 won (around $5). If you have never tried Korean traditional Hanbok, they have a few selections that you can wear for FREE. But you can only wear it inside the museum. Self-service. No much display or exhibits there. A very small room showing many different kind of kimchi, there is a tiny cooler inside that kimchi room that you can sample the kimchi. Then there is a ""art room"" that you can use the kimchi stamps on the post card when you purchase your admission ticket.", May 2017
14,5.0,Great activity for kids and adults alike!,We had so much fun making Kimchi at the museum and the kids did too! They gave us an English translator and the instructions were clear and thorough. The kids were able to participate at only 6 years old and they provided kids sized aprons and gloves / cutting tools for them. Included in the price was our own container to take home our Kimchi. The facilities were clean and modern and we will defiantly do this again!, July 2017
15,5.0,Fun for food nerds,"Okay, I love food museums and this one is very well done and clearly had money put into it with hands on touch screens, excellent short documentaries with elders talking about different types of kimchi they grew up with, and tastings. It isn't a long visit but it was not expensive either and it will change how you view the different kimchi that is put on the table in front of you. I think it is a must visit.", July 2017
16,3.0,We were the only visitors,"We went to the Insadong tourist information center on the Insadong cultural street to ask for directions and it was just down the road!  The local tourist map of Insadong makes it easy to find.  And we were given a 40% off discount voucher for the museum.  On the day / time we went, we were the only visitors.  Two Korean families went up in the lift with us but for whatever reason decided not to continue.  Your ticket allows you to get into the display areas on the 4th - 6th floors of the building by scanning in your ticket to get the door open. The kimchi tasting is self-service which you just get it from a refrigerator and there were only 3 kinds to try.  And they are the milder ones.  Various types of kimchis are displayed in bottles in the refrigerators.  I had expected to see more types as I read somewhere there are 180+ types of kimchis.  And if you want to wear Korean costume, they are there for you to wear during your visit so your selfies look more authentic!", April 2017
17,4.0,"Cute, helpful insight",It takes about 60 minutes to see this museum. Some nice interactive displays; audio guide is free with admission. Highlight is the kimchi tasting section on the 6th floor. I wish I'd come sooner: this place demystifies kimchi significantly. Check the website for classes - asvance registration required. A fun and free extra is the traditional Korean garb available to borrow during your tour for epic selfies. It is really hard to find: don't give up!, February 2017
18,3.0,Interactive,"This is not a museum where you just stare at various types of kimchi. Here, you get to try different activities that make you appreciate kimchi.", March 2016
19,4.0,Make your own Kimchi!,"Kimchi is an integral part of Korean cuisine so having a chance to learn how to make it helps you understand the culture a little better. Plus, it's fun! I did the white cabbage kimchi class. All your ingredients are laid out when you arrive. First, you watch their chef make the kimchi and then you try for yourself. It's pretty easy but just remember you need to let them kimchi ferment in your fridge for a few days before you eat it! If possible, plan to do the class at the beginning of your trip so you can eat the kimchi you made. The staff was very helpful and spoke good English.", September 2016
20,3.0,Interesting,Visited this museum dedicated to kimchi and had a good time. Lot's of interesting information and actually interactive displays that my five year old enjoyed. The reason that I am giving it 3 stars instead of 4 is because I was expecting the kimchi tasting room to be a bit more extensive than it was., August 2016
21,5.0,Great experience!,"The entry for two only cost us KRW5000 as they had a two-for-one offer and we were also given two complimentary bottles of water. We also borrowed two English audio guides - make sure you have an ID on you.The museum is very interactive and educational - staff go out of their way to show you how the displays work to maximise your experience. You can also try on a hanbok and take pictures in it for free. (An experience that often costs KRW 15,000 on Insandong)Make sure you watch some of the short films on kimchi making - they are very interesting.You can also design a postcard on the top floor where they have a range of cute kimchi-themed (obviously!) stamps.Next to the card-making room is a 'kimchi experience' workshop where, I think, you can sing up for a kimchi-making class.", August 2016
22,3.0,"Highly interactive displays, go if you are a kimchi fan","This is a place I definitely would not have thought of, however a friend wanted to see it so I went along.  The museum is set up to guide you through a series of rooms that take you through a journey to explore every aspect of kimchi.  The displays are very interactive and modern, there are a lot of videos and educational touchscreen displays in several languages that illustrate how it is made, the health benefits, history and cultural significance.   There is a large touchscreen table where you can ""virtually"" go through the motions of making a batch.  If you already are familiar with how kimchi is made, you might find the part a bit remedial.   There are 3 movies in a small viewing room, but we could not figure out how to synchronize the audio guide so we watched one of them and skipped the rest.    At the end there is a small tasting room where two styles of kimchi can be sampled.  There are also classes and demos however we did not participate in them (it looked like they were setting up for a session later in the day). I am not a kimchi buff, so for me what made this museum better than expected was the high quality of the interactive displays.   Without these elements, in my opinion the subject matter would have only been mildly interesting. It is located in a Insadong, which is a great area to visit.  You don't have to spend a lot of time here.  If you are in the area and you LOVE kimchi or are highly interested in food/culinary history, you will probably find an interesting way to spend an hour or so.", October 2015
23,3.0,Not a lot to do but fun for a quick visit,"Honestly, we happened upon the Kimchi Museum accidentally and we were freezing so decided to check it out to get out of the cold. It was very interesting to learn more about what many would consider to be the national dish of Korea, and we enjoyed the interactive displays and information. Signage at the museum said it's one of the world's top food museums, but like others have said, there isn't a ton to do and it won't take you long to go through it. An annoyance for me was the fact that there wasn't a coat check and they wouldn't let us leave our coats up front so we had to lug them around with us throughout the visit, which detracted from the experience.", December 2015
24,2.0,Located in Insadong and not exciting at all,"The only reason we visited this gallery is because the day we chose to visit Insa Dong, it was snowing heavily and some of the souvenir and handicraft stores were closed due to the heavy snow flurries. We wanted to wait it out so there were a few museums and galleries there so we visited them. I am not a gallery fan but the art here was very attractive and the people in the gallery weren’t trying to push their art. If you are into art galleries you might want to check this place out since it impressed me and I’m not an art lover.", February 2016
25,3.0,Interactive displays,"Not a whole lot of information. The displays were interactive though, which was nice. They had samples of kimchi out as well. If youre dying to learn about kimchi then check this out otherwise it can be passed", January 2016
26,3.0,Fantastic Idea But Lacking Content,"No doubt, kimchi is popular in Korea. Having a museum is a great idea, but this one was lacking content. The displays were sparse, and I feel like they could have provided a lot more information. Nonetheless, I am glad I went. The English translation devices were helpful.", December 2015
27,5.0,Taste bud zinging museum!,"An excellent, newly opened, multi-sensory, multi-media museum. Fascinating historical to present day Kimchi making. Tasting room, creative arts workshop and kimchi making cooking lessons available. Audio guide available and highly recommend.  Well worth a visit.", September 2015
28,5.0,Now reopened in Insa-dong!,"Come find this excellent museum in the Maru builidng in Insa-dong.5,000 Korean won entrance fee includes audio guide (high recommend you get this as it'll make your experience better if you're a non-Korean speaker).Videos to watch and even samples of two types of kimchi. Love it!", September 2015
29,3.0,Worth to Visit,"It is not fun place to visit as a Native Korean. I know a lot about process of making Kimchi. But for the foreigners, it might be interesting. The good point is that you can enjoy Kimchi at the end. This museum moved to other town.", January 2015
30,4.0,Nice museum worth a visit.,"It was a nice view to see this, but I think you would want to be kind of a Kimchi buff. We lent the audio guide and found it somewhat usefull. We actually watched the 3 movies in the study room, but had quite a lot trouble starting it at the right time, so that was not so usefull. Small taste of 2 different kimchi, I had expected more, also more in the recipe and book selling business, but we did not find. Overall a nice experience.", August 2015
31,3.0,"Small, but inexpensive, and educational","This museum was in the Mall and easy walking distance from our hotel room at the Coex. Since it was so inexpensive we decided we would check it out. There were lots of displays and information about kimchi and it's history. How kimchi is healthy and how it's different in each part of the country. We learn what ingredients are found in different kimchis and near the end was a sampling area with about 7 different types.It was a fast visit, under an hour, but I am still glad we visited this small museum devoted to kimchi.", July 2014
32,3.0,Worth seeing,"Actually this was surprisingly memorable even for it's novelty value.  Not being Korean myself, kimchi has limited value to me aside from liking the taste.  But for Koreans it's a matter of national identity.  I wouldn't travel too far to see this but if you're in the area and need something with an A/C. Ha ha.  You will learn some stuff. Always a good thing.", July 2014
33,3.0,"Small museum, not a must-go",The museum is quite small and took me about 15-20minutes to finish looking at the exhibits. You can find out about the history and different types of kimchi. There is also a tasting room for some common types of kimchi.In my opinion it's not a must-go museum given its size and corresponding entrance fee., September 2013
34,5.0,small but informative and interesting,This museum is tucked away in the COEX mall.  It takes less than an hour to go through but it was very informative.  I enjoyed learning about the many different types of kimchi as well as its history., September 2013
35,1.0,I think they closed,"We went to the COEX looking for the Kimchi Museum and could not find it.  We went to some of the stores to ask if we were in the right part of the facility and were told that the museum had closed.  If this place is still in operation, they hide it well.", April 2014
36,4.0,Good introduction to the delicious kimchi,"The Kimchi Field Museum is located at the basement level of the sprawling (and bewildering) COEX Mall. Be sure to visit the website before you visit as it may be closed for renovations. Although small'ish, the museum gives you a good overview of all things kimchi from history, to production, and of course opportunities to sample a few variations of kimchi. For the ticket price, it was well worth the visit which unless you're incredibly thorough about it, will take 30 or so minutes.Most of the museum consist of displays of fake kimchi beautifully presented behind glass. If the idea of seeing plastic eats that you can't touch or taste bores you, well, be warned because the experience here is mostly passive. There's a couple of basic push-button interactives and a resource room if you like to read about kimchi and other Korean cuisine & culture but really, the museum is for those curious and interested about kimchi. Otherwise it's going to be a pretty short visit.For me, as a big fan of museums, I definitely enjoyed it. Could it be better? Definitely as there's signs of age and some exhibits could use a makeover (but a renovation I believe is planned for). Being largely familiar with only the red pickled cabbages, it was refreshing and eye-opening to see the variations of kimchi and to not just learn how its made but to see its value and significance to Korean history and culture.", May 2013
37,4.0,Interesting!,"Having been buried under a deluge of kimchi with every meal in Korea, it's nice to learn a bit more about it. It's only 3000 won, and you can whizz around in less than an hour, but I definitely learned something from it.This little museum in the big COEX mall (by the World Trade Centre) explains the origins of kimchi, reveals the array of different types, explains the health benefits and, best of all, has a tasting room where you can try half a dozen or so different types of kimchi.Lots of photo opportunities too, and you can marvel at dishes such as ""cod gill kimchi"" and ""kimchi with fish bowels"".", June 2013
38,5.0,Small but very informative,"The Kimchi Museum is great! Located in a hole in the ground at the mall, it isn't too hard to find since you just go towards the aquarium most of the time. The museum is small, but there is a lot of really interesting information there, and you get to taste different types of kimchi! They also have some of the traditional Korean hats (men and women) so there are some cute photo ops there.", March 2013
39,5.0,cute and fun experience,This museum is in the COEX mall.  If you love kimchi like we do this is a great way to learn all about the history of it.  The museum is small and can be covered in an hour.  It's a little cheesy but informative. The exhibits are nicely done and you can take photos.  A fun little experience., November 2012
40,4.0,"Interesting informative museum on kimchi, worth visiting while in Coex mall","Had no expectations of the Pulmuone Kimchi Museum, but while there, found the visit rather pleasant and enjoyable. The entrance fee is KRW 3000 (USD2.70) and takes less than an hour for a proper viewing. There were not many visitors, and the exhibits were viewed at own pace and leisure. Staff also allow guests to take photos.The history, production and the types of kimchi are presented, with a good balance of kimchi artifacts and written displays. Some posters are text-y but they are interesting enough to read and one will definitely come away remembering some kimchi trivia after visiting. Enjoyed seeing the different mock-kimchi for different seasons, that there's kimchi for royalty and the elderly. Kimchi is also compared with fermented food items from other countries. At the end of the museum there is a kimchi tasting room, the samples are limited but it was fun trying the kimchi available here.The best way to learn about kimchi is probably to eat as much of it as possible, but personally, visiting the museum gave a broader perspective and enhanced appreciation for this ubiquitous South Korean food item. While there are other attractions in Seoul that are more worthy of touristic attention, the Pulmuone Kimchi Museum is worth seeking out if in the Coex Mall. Likely, kimchi is also featured in the National Folk Museum, however was not able to visit this other museum to compare.", October 2012
41,4.0,Kimchi Going Big Time!,"Kangnam Style is sweeping the world.  Kangnam is an area in Seoul where the beautiful people live and work.  It has a convenient subway station of that name and, from there, you can walk to the Kimchi Museum in the Coex Mall (a sight to visit in itself),  The museum is small but well done, telling the history and preparation of many varieties of kimchi.  There are displays of the instruments used in preparation, huge kimchi jars, and even a mock up of a Korean room with a mannequin you can be photographed with....as she feeds you kimchi.  The health benefits of the fiery panjon, the small dishes accompanying rice, is outlined in several panels.   One of the last rooms has a selection of several  varieties of kimchi that you can taste.  It is well worth the visit and, after wards, you can do a little Kangnam Style shopping in the mall.", September 2012
42,3.0,Lots of Kimchi,I was wondering around the mall (b/c its not far from my friends place) and I stumbled upon it. I was entertaining... it wasn't expensive to see it. They showed you the many types of Kimchi Korea makes along with how to make them. they tell you the health benefits of kimchi. Im not a huge fan of Kimchi and so towards the end there is a sample station. The lady attendant who was there was super nice and had me try a whole bunch of different types . I didn't want to be rude so I ate every sample. If you like kimchi you will like this little place., December 2011
43,4.0,very interesting history of kimchi,The museam is located inside of the COEX mall in Seoul. Easy to get to. Signs posted in English., November 2011
44,3.0,Fun but quick pit stop if you are in area/ at COEX Mall,"Went there to understand more about a popular dish in Korea. The museum is kind of small, and the level of detail about the history of the dish was not too great. Some of the exhibits looked like it saw better days. The education and data room was packed with boxes and kimchi-making ingredients. I didn't see any directions on classes, but I didn't ask... .I was overwhelmed by the many varieties of kimchi on display and there was some interactivity in the displays (read: press some buttons and lights come up/ open cupboard doors to smell ingredients eg red peppers, garlic...). The kimchi tasting station was nice with 6 varieties for you to try.Overall I'm glad we went, but I left wondering if the entrance fee of 3,000won was worth it... Then again we learnt a little about kimchi history, so that was okay. Overall, I'll recommend if you have time to spare, but don't go out of your way to visit.", November 2011
45,5.0,"cute, informative, with free samples!","i was really excited about going to the kimchi museum in seoul.  i was ending a 2 week trip through SE asia, and knew that i couldn't handle going to any more temples or art museums.  this is a very small place and won't take up much of your time, definitely less than 1 hr.  it's located in the COEX mall (metro stop: samseong, look for the COEX mall exit) but is somewhat hard to find.  i recommend going directly to one of the mall's info counters and asking where it is.  alternatively, you could try asking about the location of the 7-11 convenience shop inside the mall.  near there, there is a set of stairs - go down the stairs and go out the door to the left labeled exit 16.  this will lead to some escalators - go down them (by now you will see the signs for the kimchi museum) and voila.  if you are a foodie, i would definitely try to stop here during your trip to seoul.  the museum goes through the history of kimchi, has a zillion plastic models of different kimchi varieties, discusses the health benefits of kimchi, talks about pickled foods in other parts of the world, and best of all, has a small sampling room where you can try 8 different types of kimchi.  sadly there is no gift shop, as i would have loved to get a t-shirt or something from here.", January 2011
