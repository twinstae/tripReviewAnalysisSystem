0,5.0,Wonderful forest park. Not necessarily to come for tourists.,"Really nice park in southern Gangnam-gu District. it's huge and the forest is amazing. But, tourists don't need to come here because this is quite away from most touristic sites.- Many tall trees create shades and it's good to avoid heat in summer.- There are surrounding roads and wedding area inside. Children and camping tents, too. It's a bit disappointing not to feel peace in silence.- There is a little snack bar and things are highly priced.- It consists of two parts divided by the road. There's a metro station between them.- The lower part has some memorial structures and many costume play photoshoots.- This park is connected to the Yangjaecheon Stream Boardwalk and it's also good to take a walk.", June 2019
1,5.0,Yangjae Citizens Forest Park - romantic fall retreat for couples,"Yangjae Citizensâ€™ Forest is a lush public park located in Yangjae-dong featuring over 70 different species of tree including zelkova, maple and pine trees. A popular picnic destination with Seoulites, it's also a peaceful and hidden gem to bask in Korea's stunning fall colours. The park is an absolute heaven for family and couples to talk a romantic walk, just like in the Korean dramas. Far from the tourist crowds, revel in the splendour of the rich palette of autumn colours and changing seasons.Directions:Yangjae Citizen's Forest Station, Exit 5 for Yangjae Citizens' Park.", November 2018
