1,4.0,"Nice area for theatre, dinner and drinks","Like Hongdae and Sinchon at the opposite end of Gangbuk, Daehangno has a distinctively youthful and laid back vibe, with shops and F&B places catering mainly to University students and young adults. The area is rather quiet even on weekend mornings, with crowds building up only 4pm streaming into the cinemas and many cafes in the neighbourhood. Walk away from the shops and cafes to visit the Ihwa mural village which has colorful, witty pictures handpainted on the walls of old buildings, returning to Daehangno in the evening for dinner and drinks. Those who do not fancy Korean food or Korean version of American grub may opt for one of several Thai and Vietnamese resthurants in the area. The pubs with alfresco seating offering craft beers, sausages and tapas are worth checking out too.", June 2018

12,5.0,One of the city's most underrated neighborhood,"Daehangno doesn't usually come on top of Seoul's touristic attraction list, but it definitely should. In such a small district, you can experience different facets of Korea's cultural, nighlife and culinary scenes. On the west end, you have Sungkyunkwan University  (Korea's oldest higher-learning institution) and it's university street, food of shops and affordable restaurants and bars. In the middle, the actual daehangno, which is Korea's Broadway, since it has the country's highest concentration of theaters and music halls. On the East side of the street, you'll find bustling Streets with a vibrant nightlife. More accessible than Gangnam, more authentic than Itaewon, more stylish than Hongdae, it features bars, restaurants, music venues and stores of all kinds. If you head East even more, you'll reach Naksan Park, which is actually more of all small mountain, and offers amazing views of Northern Seoul ; as well as the lovely Indie Iwha neighborhood.", May 2015

18,4.0,Nice and Probably Better if Better Planned,"Lured by the possibility of catching an interesting show or jazz performance, we headed to Daehangno one evening for some food and entertainment. It was too late to follow the walking tour guide of the Seoul Metropolitan Government (which takes you around public areas and places to eat), so we just explored the immediate area around Hyehwa station. We were drawn by the small stores selling clothes, shoes and make-up; saw plenty of restaurants that seemed to cater to a younger set (hence, cheaper – and they have Saboten!); and generally liked the atmosphere of the town -- busy, bright and not too touristy. Unfortunately, because we sort of jumped right in without carefully considering where to go and what to do, we ended up in a so-so chicken stew restaurant where the staff only spoke Korean. We were also unable to find a jazz bar or a non-verbal performance theater where our lack of Korean language skills wouldn't  matter. In short, we ended up going home after a meal and some accidental/incidental window shopping. I believe this  place deserves another look after more careful research and planning. I'm coming back in the mid-afternoon so I can follow the official walking guide. There are a few interesting daytime places in Hyehwa – there’s a palace/botanical garden, Sungkyunkwan University and a pretty park.", March 2013
19,4.0,Heart of Korea's Theatrical Culture,"If New York has broadway, Seoul has Daehakro. Unfortunately, most theatres are limited to sketch show types and not many musical in this area. Also, all shows are in Korea. So this may limit your experience depending on your language skill.However, this area has other things to offer many cheap good quality restaurants owing to its proximity to SungKyunKwan University and very long time ago(1970s ish) Seoul National Uni(now moved to South Seoul). Whilst Seoul National Uni main campus has moved down south, its medical school has stayed put. It's one of the top 3 hospitals in Korea with extremely skilled physicians and surgeons. So if you are visiting this hopspital elective/ fellowship training etc this area cannot be avoided.In terms of accommodation, there is not much accommodation close to this area unfortunately. But easily accessible by line no. 4(blue) which is the name same line as Myoung-Dong, Dongdae Mun and Yong San.", February 2013
20,3.0,famous street for the plays,"it is one of best areas to enjoy"" play "" of th etheater however, I am not sure if it is same to foreign visitors. atmosphere of the street is very animated in the evening", January 2012
