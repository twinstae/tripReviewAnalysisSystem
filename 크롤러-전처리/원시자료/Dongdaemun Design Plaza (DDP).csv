0,4.0,Nice design,"I went there two times, AM and PM. The night scenery is so beautiful. So many places to take photos. Outside the building, there are roses being displayed (actually for kdrama shooting, but somehow they left it there as it become famous with tourists). I would like to recommed", October 2019
1,2.0,A little tense,For me it was a bit disappointing visiting S. Korea. I can feel a bit of tension wherever I would go around the city. The people were not as warm as expected. I don’t know if it was due to a language barrier or they were just not trying to be nice.  I’m Caucasian and my wife is Japanese and at a lot of places we went I didn’t really enjoy myself. It was our first time visiting. But as for me I probably won’t go back again. This is my opinion, April 2019
2,4.0,Worth a visit,"Definitively worth a visit, especially if you are interested in design and arts.Depend on what exhibition will be held during your visit, but even without interesting exhibition, you can visit the building during a sunny day.", January 2020

Designed by the late internationally acclaimed Pritzker Architecture Prize recipient, visionary Zaha Hadid, Dongdaemun Design Plaza, frequented by both tourists and locals, greets all with the notable humanistic art of architecture.  It imparts a feeling of liquid, fluid metal.  Seoul, the capital city of South Korea, home to 10 million people, is a modern world mega-city, designated in the year 2010 as the “World Design Capital.” It is indeed fitting that he Dongdaemun Design Plaza so elegantly captures the beauty and energy of Seoul.The Dongdaemun Design Plaza is home to the Dongdaemun History and Culture Park, featuring the Dongdaemun Relic Area 2, an archaeological site discovered at the former baseball field of the Dongdaemun Stadium Complex, yielding knowledge about the life of Korean people during the Joseon period.  The tile-paved path believed to relate to the Japanese colonial period connects the building sites and the Well Site and Fireplace Feature depicted along the path.  The dual-languages of the signage of the site are Korean and English.

8,5.0,"A Modernistic Piece of Art, and Architecture as well as Technology.","There is very little I can tell you about this outstanding and gorgeous piece of engineering and architecture. Designed by world renowned architect, Zaha Hadid who is an Iraqi/British citizen..The place has conveniently allocated metro entrances beneath the structure. I think 3 to be precise. Before you get to the building there is a mayor plaza and a walking street/ramp that leads you to the heart of it. The entrance is beneath the full structure.The DDP of its name means: Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) has the meaning of 'Dream, Design and Play' as far as I was informed. The place is also famous and renowned for it has staged diverse cultural events including exhibitions, fashion shows, product launch shows, forums and conferences.DDP's exterior features over 40,000 aluminum panels, none of which are the same. As I mentioned before the plaza is home to various exhibition spaces, design museum, sky lounge, rest area and a souvenir shop.Is really a beauty of Art, and Architecture as well as Technology.

Please check operating hours or any announcement before you go., January 2020
10,3.0,Misleading information!!,"The website or it's advertising stresses to get here at dusk! However by dusk only a few shops are open!The Plaza would be busier if your opening times were more precise.

16,5.0,Dongdaemun Design Plaza,"A truly impressive futuristic, sci fi looking complex that deserves a wow factor on first impression especially if you just exited the subway stop.  The grounds and surrounding area are massive you could easily spend two days exploring this area as it also includes historical Dongdaemun wall and gate parkway etc.  The DDP is an art gallery design complex that has numerous spaces and rooms for outdoor performances and conferences.  Another interesting factor that there are archelogical finds surrounding the complex area that was unearth during construction and this has been integrated into the overall area.  This is an outstanding architectural design complex that is impressive when viewed both during the daylight and evening hours.", November 2019
17,5.0,Wonderful space to visit and get some nice photos,"This beautifully designed building is part of the Design Plaza, with regularly exhibitions and performances. There is a small food court area and with few cafes around the basement level of the Plaza. It is also a good place to wait for the HopOn HopOff tour buses which makes DDP their main stop for both lines.... Right across the street and surrounding areas are 5-6 large department stores, some which are opened till 4-5am.", November 2019
18,4.0,Overwhelming,Vast building designed by Zaha Hadid covering a few city blocks. Definitely worth a visit. Various shops and galleries inside and usually a lively market outside., November 2019
19,3.0,Artistic,"The building design itself is interesting. Sloping corridor to get to the various levels that locate the museum.From the outside, it looks like a gigantic docked spaceship. It has two sections, the design plaza on one side and a museum on the other. When you are done, the shopping is simply overwhelming. This is the place for those that do not fancy the bazaar style shopping as in Namdaemun market. This place has a few big malls for fashion mostly. It has even has two underground shopping malls. One at the main street and the other is adjoining the Metro station. Good for photo opp and place to shop", December 2019
20,3.0,Average,"The structure of DDP itself loks futuristic, something like out of a Star Trek movie. However there are not many shops in there and can look deserted. I guess you have to appreciate art or design, for me there is not much to see except the structure itself", November 2019
21,4.0,Unique,The architectural facade of DDP is very unique. Outside the building is a good place for watching people and drinking coffee., December 2019
22,2.0,Empty megastructure,"It is a iconic piece of architecture on a monumental scale. It was a huge disappointment though, there was almost no content and so much of the museum space was closed or empty. The shopping area was billed as a design market, it was not at all curated as “design” goods. The remains of historical buildings in and amongst the futuristic mega buildings were the most interesting parts of the park. Overall, the sheer bleakness of the interior was fascinating, but I was very frustrated at the lack of museum content. The one small exhibit gallery with exhibits in it was okay, but not of a scale to fit this giant park. So, be aware that besides the giant swooping building, there isn’t anything else to see.The central stair in the design building is amazing, there is some striking architecture.", December 2019
23,5.0,Amazing architecture ,"Beautiful, artistic architecture that houses a museum, a kids playground, a gift shop and underground shopping mall. Take the lift up to the roof top and strolled down the ramp while admiring the wonderful view!", December 2019

35,4.0,Great Spot and Marvellous building ,What an amazing building!! The little shops in DDP were really interesting and worth exploring. Spend a lot of time in there. Glad that interior is not overly clutter but kept clean and minimalistic. The outside was full of activities so it was worth a trip both inside and out., November 2019
36,3.0,Looks beautiful from the outside but didn't really get the point of it,Was looking forward to coming here but after marvelling at the structure and sculptures outside we were a bit bemused by the inside.

37,5.0,Wonderful Place,It is a wonderful place to visit. Great architecture and atmosphere. They have different exhibitions., October 2019
38,4.0,Best seen at night,"This is a fascinating building which looks great from pretty much any angle. There didn’t seem to be an awful lot to do there - a small shopping arcade & a gallery for exhibitions plus some historic remains in the grounds with a small museum - but we spent an hour or so there, then went and ate in the arcades nearby then came back once it was dark when it looked even better. It reflects the light from surrounding buildings & looks quite otherworldly. Well worth a brief visit.", October 2019
39,5.0,Architectural Delight,"As an architecture buff, I found this plaza in Seoul to feature one of the most innovative modern structures that I have seen. I first visited the 7-level (4 above ground and 3 below) building during the day and was so impressed that I returned to introduce the center to my husband that night. Designed by architect Zaha Hadid, the futuristic construction exhibits no straight lines or right angles. Instead, it presents elongated, curvy forms, built with concrete and cloaked in 45,000 aluminum panels.At night, the center’s lights seem to glow from within. At certain exterior vantage points, its shape and silvery hue give the impression of what I imagine a giant spaceship to look like. The park next to the building further enhances the look. It holds 25,550 LED roses, which light up 5 minutes after sunset and are absolutely stunning. It was a magical experience to stroll here in the dark. Inside, the curves continue in long corridors and connecting stairways (there are also standard elevators). The center serves as a fairly new venue for design in Seoul, featuring an art hall, meeting space, a museum, a design lab and a design market. I visited the huge lab, which displays a variety of well-crafted items for sale and gives visitors the opportunity to meet the designers. We enjoyed a light dinner in one of the many eateries in the market, which is connected to the nearby Dongdaemun shopping centers.DDP, located in Downtown Seoul, is easily reached by subway. Take Line 2, 4 or 5 to Dongdaemun History and Culture Park Station and leave through exits 1 or 10.", November 2018

41,4.0,Stunning,"I loved the outside of this structure with its sinuous metal shape winding around gardens and walkways and couldn't wait to explore further.  It is beautiful and whatever is going on inside, the building itself is worth a visit.  There were two exhibitions on when I visited which were both quite interesting but didn't really float my boat - but that's subjective, they were very well presented and worth the time I spent there.  Take time to explore the building, the nooks and crannies and little architectural surprises are a joy to discover.", September 2019

Inside there is a museum, and the Cafe de Fressina. A visit to the cafe is a must - it is in a huge cavern, with the flooring, the furnishings and the stunning serving counter designed by Zaha Hadid.

Such a beautiful architectural design that has to be seen in person as photos don’t do it justice.

Without the signages you would not know where is the entrance to the building.We walked around the DPP on a late afternoon to appreciate its exterior. Each different angle gives you a fresh perspective of the building. We didn’t visit any of the indoor exhibitions. There are shops, cafe and restaurants in the basement, and street artists who could do a quick portrait for you.The DDP is directly connected to a subway station.

Overall a good place to hang out and chill after a long day.", May 2019
89,4.0,Special Curvy Building,"This building was full of curves and flowing lines that made it one of the coolest buildings we visited.  Inside an almost all white walkway spiraled up to the top floor making for a long walk along the outer circumference of DDP.  A staircase with an oddly angled and brown contrasting steps brought us back down.The building and surrounding areas were open 24 hours a day.   I walked around for free inside but to visit any of the exhibits or museums you just had to pay an admission fee (roughly W16000 for adults).  On the ground floor was a temporary exhibit on Disney animation which seemed to be quite popular.  There also was a Disney store and lots of silkscreened animation scenes from the likes of Frozen, Big Hero 6, and Moana.  On the second floor was an art museum.  On the third floor was a children’s play area, some collaboration space and on the roof, a viewing area and a cafe.  In the back was a lush landscaped area with seating, a piano and various art pieces.  In the front was a large courtyard where lots of people were congregated.My daughter previously visited during the nighttime and enjoyed seeing the building lit up.  We will have to visit again.", June 2019

Really nice to relive the childhood memories and learnt more about how Disney actually evolves through the years. :-)Tickets are @ 15,000 KRW for an adult.There's another area with cafes and shops. Else just take a seat outdoor and enjoy the breeze.We saw the LED rose at night too!", May 2019
93,5.0,Extraordinary contemporary architecture,"Don't miss a visit to the DDP if you want to get away from temples for a while and see an ultra-modern side of Seoul. Aside from the architecture, the centre has other attractions, and shops. When I visited there was a Disney Animation exhibition. Definitely worth seeing. Oh, and if you play the piano, there are several dotted around the complex. Just sit down and play!", May 2019
94,5.0,Look like a scifi spaceship,The building designed by the wellknown late Zaha Hadid looks like a scifi spaceship landed in the middle of the city aurrounded by shopping malls. It looks amazing and walking in it feels like inside something surreal. Every corner is curved giving the feeling of endless boundary without borders. Really very interesting design concept and realization., May 2019
95,3.0,It’s okay,"I may have selected the wrong time to visit so take that into account. First, if you enjoy architecture, the building itself is so unique and beautiful that you can’t go wrong. The building, the artistic statues outside (perhaps the correct term would be sculptures?) are definitely worth seeing in person. The interior is peaceful and calm which contradicts what you might anticipate looking at the space age like exterior. However, there wasn’t a lot going on inside during my particular visit. If you have young kids, they would have fun on I believe it was the third or possibly fourth floor.", May 2019

99,4.0,Of Curves and Elongated Structures,"First time to visit DDP and was impressed with its design. It’s like an infinity elongated curve from start to end. It would be nice if you could see the plaza in its total structure as it is quite unique and futuristic. We were there late afternoon and when it got dark, the lights gave the plaza an awsome ambience. They have this attraction which we visited and waited for hours the so-called led rose garden where hundreds or thousands of roses automatically light up as the sun sets. It was a nice view as the night went deeper. There are also have art hall, museum, design lab, design market, culture and history park but most of them were closed when we were there. It’s quite tiring if you tour around the big plaza but there are coffee shops and restaurants where you can eat and rest. It’s good to visit this place.", April 2019
100,3.0,Flowing emptiness,"I do love design so, I was really looking forward to my visit to the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP). Having dragged my family to it, I must say, I was --- disappointed.Yes, amidst Seoul’s skyline, the DDP’s facade is aesthetically unique for it’s fluid lines and steel curvatures. There is no doubt, its sheer outline exudes design.But once, we appreciated the swooping façade and geometries, there is just emptiness inside the building: empty rooms, empty echoey corridors and vast empty spaces. For a designer, space is a design element but when we went (around 4 pm on April 17) there were no exhibits, no permanent showcase not even, food trucks. Just one big EMPTY building.OK, if you are a modern architecture design nut (and enjoy photographing shapes) but, you might want to skip this if you have mixed group. For a showcase design plaza, they really could have done more with it.", April 2019

107,2.0,Check before you go,"We aren't only to find out there were no exhibits. Literally zero things to look at inside. It's a nice enough building, but we were expecting to see actual design work inside, only to discover they were between exhibits, have no permanent collections, and most people went for the market out front and the children's playland on the top floor. It was very disappointing. Would highly recommend finding out if there's actually something to look at before you go, else just stop by if it's on your way to someplace else. Not worth it to go to Dongdaemun just to look at an empty building.", April 2019
108,5.0,Modern Seoul,"Generally Seoul has not fine architecturel profile.. but this DDP is well aesthetic huge building..

I visited unknowingly on the anniversary of her death of 31.03, 3 years ago and you can see the reason she was famous. It’s an architectural piece of art for the ages. I am stunned looking at the curves of the building and then to find out it’s mostly usable space was incredible. I thought it would be simply design, but it’s functional which makes it doubly amazing. I absolutely loved every aspect of the building and the exhibits. Another South Korean architectural marvel.", March 2019

127,5.0,Spectacular construction designed by Zaha and the best instagram place in Seoul,"Located in a Seoul-style block, dongdaemun design plaza is a extremely strange but spectacular construction. Just like zaha always did, she made DDP the an unusual construction and a representation of dongdaemun or even the whole Seoul.I always like zaha’s design and think it very cool to take photo here. You can take very instergrammable photos inside or outside the building since the the Zaha style is everywhere here.If you hope to take some pure architecture photos, I would recommend you to come the eighth floor of lotte FITIN which is a shopping mall facing to DDP. There are lots of clean windows allowing you to take amazing photos of DDP at night. In contrast, there are some buildings nearby where you can not take satisfying photos for its dirty windows and terrible views.", February 2019
128,5.0,Spectacular construction both inside and outside,This is a must see building in Dongdaemun.  It looks like a space ship at night with glistering lights all around.   The inside is white with curves and angles on the stairways that are pleasing to the eyes. There was an art exhibition on the ground floor and interesting design items for sale when I was there in the beginining of Feburary.  There are two cafeterias that I can see on the top floor.

131,5.0,Wonderful building but best at night time,"Located in Dondaemun, and very close to our hotel, this was a really interesting place to visit for all the family. The building is truly stunning and the design resembles something from the future or like an extra-terrestrial space ship. You can wander around the outside, underneath and inside and the different views of the building continually surprise.Inside there were many things happening. There is a huge and fantastic play area for children, an exhibition of Wallace & Grommit, many shops and restaurants and cultural and art displays. Even the stairways in the building are far from normal and cleverly designed.Probably the best time to visit is in the evening time and at night when the building comes to life with subtly placed lights so it even more resembles a flying saucer or space ship.During our visit in the evening time, there were stands outdoors where people were selling handcrafted items such as jewellery, singers and musicians performing, and food trucks from the Seoul Bamdokkaebi Night Market offering all kinds of really delicious local and foreign snacks and street food.", July 2018
132,5.0,Stunning architecture ,"I find the night view of this beautiful and serene amongst the hustle and bustle of the city.

143,5.0,The architecture was stunning enough,"Went there with the intent to explore any design exhibitions.  In the end, plans were mired by the architecture and Kakao store.  The architecture was fascinating enough to capture even a layman's eyes.  At ever angle near the building, it was stunning to see it especially closer to sunset.  Spent some time taking photos of the building.  Even more fascinating was how the building was not so obtrusive that it was rude to the environment.  It remained modestly unobtrusive, retaining the harmony and yet feature it's avant-garde intent.For families, they can pop by the Kakao shop for photo opportunities with the cute figurines there.  Shopping is welcomed there too.The basement has F&B outlets and shops.  The building is conveniently connected to the Dongdaemun History & Culture Park.", December 2018
144,1.0,Art museum void if art.   ,"It’s a beautiful building and you should visit if you are a champion of significant architecture.  If you love art, you will be shattered with disappointment.  There is no art here.  Changing exhibitions means that all galleries were closed.   Buildings designed to be galleries have been turned into job fairs, malls and food courts.  It’s pathetic that a civic project has been allowed to be so misaligned with the original intent.", December 2018
145,5.0,"Great Architecture, confusing space",The architecture is stunning but the usage of the space is a bit confusing (seems to be more of an exhibition hall than a museum) so if you want to see the interior find an event or you will be limited to the hallways and public spaces.That being said I strongly recommend a visit (the entrance stairway alone is worth the visit in my opinion) and the archaeological area at the base is very interesting, August 2018

It's absolutely stunning, there's ample space to just sit and relax, chat with friends, or take in the sights. Lots of stores as well, including a LINE Friends one that was super interesting to check out and do some souvenir shopping at. Not sure it this would still be here but there were also lots of pop-up pianos that you were welcome to use and created a really awesome atmosphere. Nearby electronic rose garden was also absolutely stunning. Overall, even if you can't stay long, definitely try to stop by the DDP during your time in Seoul.", June 2018

200,5.0,Amazing building - a must for every architecture-fan..... and kid,"We visited the Dongdaemun Design Plaza late in the afternoon after a day of sightseeing as I was interested in seeing the Zaha-Hadid designed building in real life. The building itself is breathtakingly beautiful and equally impressive in my opinion and worth the trip alone. What makes it even better is that there is a very large kids play area on the top floor that provided hours of (air-conditioned) fun for our kids on a very hot day. In a busy city like Seoul that does not have a tremendous amount of activities for kids (note we live in Sydney, Australia so we're very spoilt for choice) this can be an absolute life saver and I don't understand why the play area is not advertised more.If I were to make a top 3 of things to visit in Seoul, the DDP would definitely be in it.", July 2018

There are a bunch of shops inside, The second time I came here (in 2015 I think), there was some type of event going on outside with a stage set up and some music artists were performing.  It was no one I recognized and I think they were rehearsing for something later in the day or evening.  It definitely seemed like things were still being set up.  The subway stops right at the DDP, so it's convenient to get to via subway.  You could spend so much time just taking photos outside before even going inside to explore.  It's also close to Doota and other shopping areas right across the street so expect to spend a few hours in this area if you want to go shopping.", August 2017
204,4.0,Very nice architecture,We went there primarily to shop nearby and took a coffee break inside one of the cafes.  The structure is really impressive for the architecture and good for photos.

You must take your shoes off & then just lay down relax & enjoy the shaded breeze.", July 2018
208,4.0,Great look outside. Inside is a bit disappointing.,"As many are aware of, the design is the work of the famous Zaha Hadid.Looking very cool with futuristic curvy edges.But, the inside is not impressive.

210,4.0,Futuristic landmark,"There are so many amazing buildings in Seoul to see, mostly historical palaces, but there's something new and very impressive to see, Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) it is rather futuristic. The DDP is divided into a Design Hall, Art Hall, and Museum Hall, the whole complex is free to the public to visit, we walked through one of the buildings, but got more joy out of walking around outside. The complex was built on the former sight of Dongdaemun Stadium, built by the Japanese in the 1920s during the Japanese occupation.  During the process of redevelopment of the sight, relics were found which are now displayed on a large surface under the canopy of the curved roofline.

211,3.0,Interesting Exterior but Not Much Inside,"It’s definitely worth seeing and walking around the exterior of this building but it wasn’t worth paying 10,000 Won to visit the museum inside.

212,5.0,Gorgeous inside and out,"What a fantastic idea. So much creativity to see and on the day we went, there was an African food market. Typical Seoul to always be thought provoking and creative. Great coffee shop inside if you need to shelter from the heat (or cold) too.", May 2018

It's a must visit for anyone who visits Seoul, in particular if you are interested in architecture and design.  Great photo ops both day and night. When I went this time for the exhibition on The Art of Aardman Animations: Wallace and Gromit & Friends, it was pouring. Glad that I already had a detailed look on my last visit.  Despite the heavy rain, a trip there to see the exhibition was very worthwhile.  The exhibition has already gone to Germany and Australia, and is in Seoul now. Lucky I could catch it here.

218,3.0,Worth it if you like architecture,"The only cool thing about this place is the design of the plaza and the rose led garden so go at night to see it lit up. Shopping is the same as everywhere else. I like Namdaemun market more than Gwangjang market because the street food is better. I'm not a big souvenir shopper so once you see 1 market, they're pretty much the same except for the food variety. If you're tight on time, you can stay in this area and skip Myeongdong and Namdaemun.  They're pretty much the same but this area is cleaner and more modern. If street food is more important to you and you're shopping for eyeglasses, Myeongdong and Namdaemun have more street food variety and eyeglasses selections.", June 2018

288,4.0,"impressive building, less impressive exhibitions",Just the building and the surrounding area alone are worth a visit.
