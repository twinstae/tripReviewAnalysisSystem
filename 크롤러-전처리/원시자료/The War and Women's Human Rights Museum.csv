0,5.0,Breathtakingly powerful,This museum talks exhibitions the lives of the comfort women for Japanese soldiers during World War 2.   The staff approached us with such kindness and provided us with audio guides in English and helpfully explained in detail how to use them. The first part of the museum was, October 2019
1,5.0,You have to visit this museum. ,"I came here with my girlfriend and we were stunned by this museum. It is a truly eye opening experience not only to the past but what is still happening in present day. They give you an audioguide, which is very helpful as most of the displays are in Korean. As well as being very educational and informative, the museum gives you the opportunity to donate to help fight for the end of sexual slavery and for the freedom of the women who have been affected.Anyone and everyone should go to this museum, and appreciate the bravery of the women who have stepped forward and shared their stories.", October 2019
2,4.0,Powerfully important museum,"Tucked away in a little neighborhood, this museum is a small, intimate experience of a terrible chapter in the history of World War II. The English audio guide walks visitors through the little building, where art, personal stories, and artifacts tell the painful stories of “comfort women,” sex slaves who served the Imperial Japanese Army after being abducted and forced into service. A ‘must see’ destination to understand how widespread violence against women was a historical reality that has yet to end. Stories of sexual violence that continues today in other parts of the world are also reflected in an included exhibit. Appropriate for youth ages 13 and older (many of the sex slaves were younger at the time of their kidnapping). I was glad to see both young women and men taking their time to thoughtfully proceed through the museum.", May 2019
3,5.0,Valuable museum to can know about Women's pain in War.,"CC ( 19.02.16 ) I and my son visited this museum to know more about enforced sex slaves by Japan. No photo inside, and had many exhibit about enforced sex slaves in WW II. The exhibits was more terrible than I think, and I felt sorry for women in these times. The inside was a little small, but well-managed. In some area, special exhibit was held about Vietnamese women's victim who was harmed in Vietnam War by Korean soldier. I felt sorry, too. Without considering national benefit and nationality, we don't forget and must console about innocent people who had much pain.", February 2019
4,5.0,Respect,"I have visited with one of my friend who’s father at Korea war. If u want peace u must know war and visit this museum. The new Turkish corner was excellent, but half of indoor museum were under construction, what a pity.", September 2018
5,4.0,Family vacation,Worth a short visit. Intro film and exhibits were interesting. Staff were friendly and informative. Located in a small but quaint town with an interesting main street., July 2018
6,3.0,Not the most touristy thing to do,"The museum has an important purpose and a precautionary tale of the evils of war.  Neither our taxi driver nor the concierge in our hotel had ever heard of this museum, and the location seemed like an hour from anywhere else you would rather be in Korea - but the visit was important to one person in our party and for that reason we all went.  It will not be everyone's cup of tea.  But I suppose you don't have to drink tea to know that it exists. The museum highlights a terrible aspect of war - one that has not been formally recognized by the Japanese governments.  There are funds being raised for the victims, but it seems that the victims are not seeking compensation from donors but recognition of what happened and how awful it was - and by extension how terrible that it is as it continues to happen in other wars.  Not a happy visit - but there is a message in there somewhere.", May 2018
7,5.0,An action museum,"Well done museum with the purpose to educate about the approx 200,000 ""comfort women"" or victims of sexual Slavery inflicted systematically by the Japanese government in WWII. Important to know this history in order to not repeat history and to bring awareness to other areas of the world where women are the victims of rape and violence.  Not easy to find but do your planning and you'll find it (and follow the yellow butterflies). 3,000 admission. There are bathrooms and refreshments. Ok to go solo, there is a great audio guide. If you are in town on a Wednesday, there are protests in front of the Japanese Embassy.", September 2017
8,5.0,Very moving and necessary,The museum aims to raise awareness on the pandemic of violence against women and particularly on Korean comfort women during Japan's occupation., September 2017
9,5.0,So worth it,"This is one of the best small museums i have ever been too. So emtional, so importan! Please take a visit, you will not regret it.", September 2017
10,5.0,A must-go in Hongdae,"This is one of the most powerful exhibitions I have been to. If you are in Hongdae, please spare some time and visit this museum. This could be one of the most meaningful activities of your trip.I coincidentally saw the name of this museum in Hongik University station signage. After knowing that this museum is dedicated to ""comfort women"" and that it is part of the movement for fighting for protection of women and children in war conflicts, we went there on the next day. This museum is located at an alley, not the main road. It may be easier to go there by bus than by subway. (Citymapper gives very clear directions.) The museum (as well as its entrance) was modest, but the ""yellow butterflies"" led us there. The English speaking staff member was very kind and helpful. After paying the 3,000 won admission fee, we were given the audio guide. The audio guide was very important since there was barely any English illustration about the exhibit. The audio illustration also created the right mood and tempo of our visit. While we were shocked and moved by different exhibits and images, we were impressed by the special exhibition at the basement, like the epilogue of the tour. We were glad that this museum is not a very sensational and nationalistic one that promotes hatred but one that encourages reflection.If you happen to be in Hongdae or in Seoul, please don't hesitate to go and pay tribute to these brave women.", August 2017
11,5.0,Tricky to find but worth it,"An important museum, but not a fun one.  A taxi from the World Cup metro cost about $5-6, and the driver missed the narrow, alley like street you have to go up. Afterwards I had a beer at the bar back down the hill by the main intersection and walked to Hongkik Metro. A good museum for solo visitors, as you get an audio guide for the exhibits. But it's also good if you have someone to debrief with.", May 2017
12,5.0,Very important museum full of hope,"I was blown away by this museum. I couldn't believe the struggle to get Japan to recognize their involvement in the sexual enslavement of women during WW2 was ongoing. Their dignity and fortitude in the face of this ongoing denial of their suffering is inspiring, as is their work to reach out to other affected women world wide. We also went to the Wednesday protest, where we were welcomed warmly. My only small issue is that the audio guide told us to listen to videos which were only in Korean. If they could translate the videos to English, that would be great.", April 2017
13,5.0,Learn about comfort women and their advocacy work,"it's a bit confusing to get to the museum. from hongik stn exit 2, turn left and walk further down to the bus stop for bus number 15. then stop at Gyeongseong High School intersection on street name - World Cup buk ro 11 gil. cross the street and there should be a sign with the name of the museum pointing into an alley where the museum is. but it's definitely worth the journey! really heartbreaking and eye opening experience learning about this aspect of war which is not usually talked about in many history books. learning about what these women were forced to endure makes me have great respect and admiration for all these women who have stepped forward to share their story and fight for their right to be recognised. we are standing on the shoulders of these great women. definitely a must-visit when in korea. entrance fee is 3,000won and if you don't understand Korean, they will give you an audioguide (eng + other lang) to guide you through the museum for free.", November 2016
14,5.0,Dignified explanation of a dark time,"Surprising on many levels, the museum is located in a hard-to-find side street relatively far from the city centre having been initially granted and subsequently blocked from a site within the Independence Park as it was deemed an inappropriate location by some. The museum is remarkably discreet from the outside, the main entrance could be mistaken for a side door, however a wall covered in paper butterflies with hand-written messages from past visitors gives it away. A surprising amount of the museum is dedicated to evidence that the atrocities happened at all: diaries, maps, photos - simple but clear indicators which are then followed by the Japanese government denials and subsequent legal cases. The story is hard. The outcome of their struggle for recognition remains uncertain. It is a deeply engaging place which is worth the trip. There is English language captioning on each exhibit but it is somewhat limited in content.  If you have the opportunity to go with someone who can read the Korean text it will add a lot.", September 2016
15,5.0,"Museum is a small, thoughtful, and compelling exhibit.","This museum does a good job of presenting a dark piece of the history between Japan and Korea, and honoring the women who finally told their stories. I was astounded to learn that the victims did not disclose their abuse for over 40 years, and I did not know that numerous sites throughout Asia were used by the Japanese. This is a must-see museum for anyone who cares about human rights and women's rights.", June 2016
16,5.0,A must visit,It was very touching to learn about the lives of the comfort women of Korea and what they have gone through. They have a guided recording (mp3 and earphones) that you can listen to that will explain to you the exhibits as you walk along., June 2015
17,5.0,A must visit,"On a recent family visit to Seoul we had the fortune to engage a vehicle and tour guide. The visit to the museum was more than we expected. However, we did have the added advantage of a tour guide who was able to explain in detail all aspects of what we were shown. This is a must if you have the chance to visit the area.", May 2015
18,5.0,Great experience,"What a hidden gem in Seoul.Lots of people were questioning me if I was feeling too bored to go to such a place, but after all I think I was right persisting.The War and Women's Human Rights Museum makes you reflect truly on what it would be like being a comfort woman and so as all the related gender theories.I particularly like how it plays warring sounds as you are walking through the path that takes you to the underground exhibition room.Dark yet homey enough.And very informative.The War and Women's Human Rights Museum is one of the best museums I have ever been to in in Korea (I had a hard time finding it though!).", August 2014
19,4.0,Stop Violence Against Women,"I went to this place with my wife and teenage daughter, and it was a truly meaning visit for all of us.  It's a small but valuable museum mainly focusing on victims of sex slavery by the Japanese before and during the World War Two, still an ongoing heated issue yet to be settled.However, the museum does not intend to provoke a sort of anti-Japanese sentiment often displayed by the Korean nationalists. Instead, the museum calmly and clearly views the issue as the violence against women frequently committed in the wartime. There is also a dedicated section about the wartime sexual violence committed in Kosovo and Congo wars.I hope the museum continues to develop and help reach out to the victims of war crimes in other international conflicts as well.", July 2014
20,5.0,"Hard to find, but such an important museum","First, be aware that some people refer to this as the ""Comfort Women Museum.""  That is the topic of the museum, but not its official name.  Also be aware that this is a difficult place to find.  Considering how little English most cab drivers in Seoul speak, you may want to get detailed directions from your hotel concierge before going here.  The museum is small, but well done.  Most of the displays are in Korean, so I really appreciated the audio tour that was included in the admission price--the audio is available in several languages.  I certainly knew a little about the topic of ""comfort women"" before visiting this museum, but I learned so much more after my visit.  What a tragic period of history.  Because the museum is small, you will not need more than one hour to visit.", October 2013
21,5.0,A visit off the beaten path,"While there are many fun things to do in Seoul, such as the Trickeye museum, shopping and kpop galore, it is also worthwhile to take a visit to this museum. Touching upon a part of history that is still quite unknown to people (although there have been more attention to this issue recently) this museum gives you insight to the ""comfort women"" issue of the past where many females in Japanese colonialized and occupied areas were forced to be military sex slaves for the Japanese army. Although a lot of people write this off as a ""japanese-korean"" problem, it isn't necessarily as it applies to a lot of similar issues in the present right now such as human trafficking. I won't write too much on this, only that if time permits - you won't be dissapointed visiting this museum and I would hope that you'd leave inspired to understand more about violence against women.", December 2012
