The museum is quite nice and the exhibits are well presented. There's a children's museum which I didn't go to. Contents include general Korean culture and life in the Joseon Dynasty. There is some overlap with other museums and attractions in Seoul. Similar items can be seen at the National Palace Museum which is also on the Gyeongbokgung grounds and the National Museum of Korea. In terms old old hanoks, there is the Namsan Hanok Village.  So the National Folk Museum is like the greatest hits of korean museums in terms of culture. If you don't have the time to visit them all.

94,5.0,Excellent modern and educating museum in the palace grounds.,"A bonus to visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace is the that the Nation Folk Museum is located nearly on its premise.

The gift shop was closed when we visited in the third week of April and I think it is set to re-open this summer. I recommend a visit.

What I saw was life size exhibits detailing the life events of a typical South Korean family such as weddings, 60th birthday, burial as well as clothing, medical practices, etc. The first time a Korean couple in previous times met was at their wedding, although I am sure that is no longer the case.

So I can't rate it as 1 star (terrible) or 2 stars (poor) because that would be an insult to the museum, its curators and staff.But as a tourist from the UK i didn't find any of the content at all interesting. I was in-and-out in around 10 minutes. Entry is free so if you find yourself at Gyeongbokgung Palace then by all means take a look for yourself.I imagine that for Koreans, the museum would be much more interesting.

It would be a mistake as this is an exceptional museum, very well laid out.There are 3 main galleries.  The first covers the Historical period of Korea, from prehistoric to the 20th century.  The second gallery covers seasonal life (i.e. how people lived and adapted to the 4 seasons).  The third gallery covers life passages (i.e. from birth, to marriage, to death).  It shows the various rituals and customs practiced during the Joeson period.I would highly recommend the audio guide (1,000 won + ID), which provides over 150 commentaries/exhibits.

270,5.0,The National Folk Museum of Korea,"THE NATIONAL FOLK MUSEUM OF KOREAThis is an almost unique museum, that highlights the Korean common folk, and particularly the agriculturists, who have formed  a large part of the total population over the centuries.  The emphasis is primarily on their history and their way of life, from the Paleolithic period to the present.    Many of the exhibits highlight life in a traditional Korean village , including an ox-drawn mill-stone and a water mill. These highlight the lifestyle and the customs of the people. There is considerable emphasis on agricultural implements and practices.  The visitor also sees centuries-old household goods as well as hats, shoes, traditional costumes, medical practices and even fortune-telling. Several displays are out in the open. These include a century old street scene and larger-than-life effigies of civil officials.  Of particular interest is a complete circa 1848  cottage including household items, donated by the Nam family. Many of these exquisite cultural gems represent a journey back in time.The main building of the museum has a traditional architectural design based on Korean Beopjusa Temple.  Temple architecture is also the inspiration for other areas of the museum building.There is a large children’s museum on the grounds, with a wide range of exhibits, including some for hands-on study.  Visitors are offered free private guided tours  of the museum in English, Korean,  Chinese and Japanese.  The very well stocked library and archives should satisfy even the most demanding scholar’s thirst for knowledge. The museum shop has a good selection of books, , picture postcards, DVDs, as well as replicas of historic artifacts. A large café helps the visitors to ‘recharge their batteries’ before continuing their visit of the museum. Every Saturday, there is a one-hour cultural programme of Korean music and dances in the well laid-out and air-cpnditioned auditorium of the museum. The performances are by the cream of Korean cultural talent, and the audience  shows the performers  the utmost reverence. The programme includes folk and classical dances from the Gyeongge and Yeongnam regions of Korea.  The music is performed on traditional Korean string, wind and percussion instruments. The cultural programme is a befitting introduction to one of Asia’s richest and most exquisitely beautiful cultures, and is one of the highlights of a visit to the National Folk Museum of Korea.

272,5.0,Very interesting,Found the place almost by chance on my way out of Gyeongbokgung. This is a rather classical museum but very well done. Clever (meaning : limited)  use of electronics and mostly many beautiful and interesting artefacts. I initially thought that the Museum was completely disorganized and that the visit would vibe difficult then realized that the designers made a clever work in suggesting a natural path through the various sections.

The main city has wide streets and modern shops, the folk music looks at the cities past - certainly before the Korean War. The rooms depicting the 1980s houses were interesting as when I first looked they were more like 1950s Britain. There is no mistaking the major leaps in it and housing made over the last 40 years. The museum balances this beautifully. There is plenty of space to explore the exhibits and the outside exhibits - including the coffee shops barbers and printing houses are excellent.", March 2016
