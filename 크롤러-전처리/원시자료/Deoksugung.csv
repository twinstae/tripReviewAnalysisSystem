0,4.0,"Small City Palace, Great for Visit if one is short in time",A small palace compared to that of Gyeongbukgung and Changdeokgung. This palace is perfect for those who wanted to visit one but do not have much time. The palace allows visitors to understand the ancient Korean culture. There is a change of guard ceremony at fixed timings here., November 2019
1,5.0,My favorite Palace,"This is probably one of my most favorite Palace in Seoul, definitely in the top three. It seems like it lies in the center of Seoul the way it is positioned surrounded by modern architecture of Seoul, hotels, restaurants, the City Hall and other important buildings. It’s so easy to get to by train, bus or taxi and it is within walking distance to other attractions. The Palace house also a gallery and a shop. It’s great to stroll around these old buildings and imagine how life might have been way back in the Joseph Dynasty. Right outside of the Palace in the small street on the right of it lies a famous Belgian waffle shop which I’d recommend trying. It’s not Korean but it is claimed to be one of the top 5 dessert shops in Seoul.", January 2020
2,5.0,Love of Beauty is Taste. The Creation of Beauty is Art.,"There is a common believe that most South Korean Temples look pretty much alike and that is an undeniable truth. Nonetheless there is a hidden differential beauty on each one of them. Here at this temple we could appreciate the differences.This palace also has a lot of dynamic history as has been occupied not only by the Korean Royal family. In 1897, after the incident when Emperor Gojong took refuge in the Russian legation, he returned to this place and named it Gyeongungung again. During the Japanese occupation of Korea in 1592, the residential buildings became a temporary royal residence after all the other palaces were destroyed by fires.Many of the structures here have since been removed or sold. In 1933, all buildings except for a few central and western style buildings were removed. It was then made a park and opened to the public.At the end of the trail you may walk you'll find a turquoise Blue Fountain. European looking. On the left of this you will find a smaller part of the palace (detached unit) and on the right of the fountain you'll be right in front of the Deoksugung National Museum of Modern & Contemporary Art.Its important at the door to purchase the full package ticket so that you can appreciate both. Palace and Museum.Since 2007, restoration work to restore Deoksugung Palace to its original specifications. This work has been ongoing. We do recommend extensively this palace although we couldn't appreciate the full beauty as it has been a bitter winter this January, but in Spring must be definitely wonderful.Don't miss it.", January 2020
3,5.0,Deoksugung is a unique palace,"I visited 2 palaces (Deoksugung & Gyeongbokgung) during my visit to Seoul last month. 'though Deoksugung is not as big as Gyeongbokgung, but Deoksugung is quite unique compare to Gyeongbokgung. You can find both Joseon Dynasty & Western influences in this palace, something that you can't see in another palaces in Seoul ..", December 2019
4,5.0,Plan to Visit here and the other Historical Places... and do not rush the enjoyment,Why pay for tour guides when you can hop on and off the subway and visit so many places in Seoul?  This is yet another great place to mark on your tour and enjoy your photos for years to come., January 2020
5,5.0,Beautiful!,A well maintained palace in the modern city. It is smaller than Gyeongbokgong and Changdeokgung. Beautiful scenery!, November 2019
6,4.0,Changing of the guard ,"I've been here a few times over the years and it never disappoints. I love the fact that it has a changing of the guard ceremony (3 times a day I think) and other stuff going on too. Once inside though it feels like a different world with a park like ambience plus a mixture of Korean and Western architecture which makes it unique for a Korean palace. I like to just sit and watch the world go by here.I walked here, but it's close to City Hall metro station if you're using the underground.", November 2019
7,5.0,Great guide,"This was the last of four Palaces that we visited while in Seoul and the guide was the best we had experienced.  It was a smaller Palace in comparison to some of the others, but the information regarding buildings, customs and structures carries across them all.  Unfortunately the Change of Guard was postponed due to protests.  Including the free guided tour - we spent around 1.5hours here.", October 2019
8,4.0,Changing of the guards,This is a much smaller palace as compared to the grand Gyeongbokgung palace and is in the heart of the city. We landed there just in time for the changing of the guards ceremony which is again not as elaborate as the one at Gyeongbokgung but is still nice. (You can watch the ceremony from the street. You need a ticket only to enter the palace grounds). The visit does not take much time as the palace grounds are small. The guide pointed out to us some of the structures dating back to 1600, April 2019
9,5.0,A smaller palace if you don't have much time,A smaller palace in the middle of town. Well worth a visit especially if you take the (free) guided tour (about 50 minutes). Time your visit to see the changing of the guard which is quite entertaining., November 2019
10,4.0,Lovely autumn colours,"Deoksugung is right at City Hall Station. I went there to see the City Wall, the external wall of Deoksugung. This time I went inside the palace, as there were lovely maple trees showing beautiful autumn colours. Happened to see also the show performed by the palace guards.", November 2019
11,4.0,Great palace to visit at night,Deoksugung is the only palace open at night and the way it is all lit up is both beautiful and atmospheric. There was a children's concert going on when we visited which we stopped to listen to., September 2019
12,4.0,Wacth the changing of the gurads,Have to go at the right time to see the changing of the guards in front gates. They let you take pictures with them afterwards.Its free and it was really cheap to go into the gardens after if you wanted but we did not go in., May 2019
13,4.0,Good for two Visits,"I really liked this palace. Not as well known as the others but deserves two visits. First, the afternoon changing of the guards is fun to watch and you can stand right next to the guards. Second, this palace stays open at night and makes for some great pictures with the lights on the grounds and the surrounding buildings.", September 2019
14,5.0,Beautiful in the evening ,What a beautiful palace to visit at night. We stayed 5 minutes walk from the palace and was reading about the palace being open during the evenings. Definitely highly recommend an evening visit. It had a romantic atmosphere and was lovely to visit as a couple. Entrance is 1000 Korean won per person. The grounds houses a art museum and some modern art installations are visible on the site. Made even more special once lit up. As the palace is situated near the city hall and I the heart of the built up city the tall skyscrapers are even more visible at night when they are lit up with their neon lights. Spectacular blend of old with the new modern backdrop. Will definitely return during the day. It might be the smallest palace of them all but I would definitely recommend a evening visit as you will experience it in a way you cant see the others., October 2019
15,4.0,Pretty nice,"But pretty small. With the audio guide no need to spend more then an hour. Part of the palace pass, which contains five palaces. Come early to see the changing of the guards, but dont enticipate something ""european""", September 2019
16,4.0,Lovely Temple Grounds,"Adjacent City Hall is Deoksugung Temple Grounds which is down the road from the main palace. Outside this temple you can find the Royal Guards performing their Change over ceremonies and other cultural displays. Once you get inside you will find that this temple ground is larger than it first appears with a Cafe/Gift Shop, forested wild pathways, council buildings, an Art museum, temple grounds & buildings and many large art installations. If you arrive during the Korean holidays the temple is free entry, otherwise you will have to pay to enter. There is plenty of exploring to be done in this little area which almost appears hidden from the surrounding city streets like an oasis for people to come and relax or to learn about Art & History or even get a bit of exercise away from the traffic heavy streets of Seoul. I highly recommend a visit to this temple even if it is to waste a little time on your journey around the city.", September 2019
17,3.0,The Smaller And Less Interesting Of The Three palaces,Deoksugung  Palace was used by the King when he was in exile during the Japanese invasion of 1592. This was used as a King's residence until King Gojong died in 1919.There is a mix of ancient and modern architecture. We visited to see the changing of the guard but it was cancelled because of very (very) light rain., September 2019
18,4.0,Changing of the Guard,Good display of the Changing of the Guard on the outside of the palace gates between 10:00-14:00. You don’t need a ticket to watch it from the street. Lasts about 15 minutes with photo opportunities with the actors after the show is over. Worth the trip to see the traditional dress and the parade., September 2019
19,4.0,Closed on Mondays,"1. Closed on Mondays2. Get the Royal Palace Pass (entry to multiple museums - including The Secret Garden); less queuing, saving money and all sites are worth a visit3. The actual review: We visited on a Sunday and saw the changing of the guards - narrated in Korean and English. Photo opportunities with the guards were free after the ceremony. Mix of old-school Korean buildings and western buildings, but all worth a visit. It's small, but you can't argue with the price! There's a free guide at the entrance, and not the one to visit if you only have time for one, but can easily be done in a day of other activities.", September 2019
20,5.0,Day trip to Seoul,"Visited during a day trip. it was very cold but the day went well as the Palace is easy to navigate, and you can listed to the tour in English as well as have an English tour book.", January 2019
21,5.0,Royal Palace,"Deoksugung is one of the 5 royal palaces in Seoul. It is covered by the Royal Palace Pass, but entry is only 1000KW. It is a small palace compared to the other main palaces, but I think one of the nicer and more interesting. The architecture reflects a blend of Korean with western influences.", July 2019
22,5.0,Small palace,This palace is a lot smaller compared to the others. Easily walked through the entire grounds within 30minutes. The changing of guards is not to be missed. The audio guide can be rented at the entrance., July 2019
23,4.0,"Korea, with European influence","Interesting collection of traditional Korean architecture (e.g., Daehanmun Gate, Junghwajeon Hall, etc), a fusion of Korean and European architecture in Jeonggwanheon Hall, then more classical European in Seokjojeon Hall and the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (both fronted by a European garden).  All overlooked by the high rise buildings of modern Seoul!  I relatively small complex, easy to traverse in 60 or 90 minutes, but the architectural contrasts are a highlight.   Along with the changing of the guard!  11am, 2pm, and 3:30pm.  Noisy, colorful and informative - really well presented, and plenty of photo opportunities at the end.", July 2019
24,4.0,Small palace compound,"This palace opening hours are 9am to 9pm. I visited this palace just before 6pm, initially hoping to stay until dark to capture the compound with its lightings. However, the palace is rather small, with only 6 buildings in total. As such, I spent only an hour here and left, not willing to wait till sunset around 8pm.The buildings architecture and design are generally the same as other palaces. One unique building is Jeonggwanheon Pavilion, built by a Russian architect, incorporating Korean and Western designs. This pavilion was used for banquets for foreign visitors when they visited the palace.", June 2019
25,2.0,"Deoksugung, FREE Hanbok rental for 20 mins.","We ventured here for the free rental of Hanbok, and the changing of guards performance:Changing of Guards ceremony 11:00(1st Time) / 14:00(2nd Time) / 15:30(3rd Time)Closed on Mondays.We queued for the Hanbok at 1300, as the sign stated that the counter will be opened at 1330.The counter eventually opened at 1345, with crowds over-powering the queue.  We voiced out to the crowd and the attending lady in charge.  Yet, the lady in charge replied that she only attends to the people who approached her first, regardless of the queue.  Hence, we voiced out to the crowd that there was queue and be sensible to those who have waited for 45mins.  We were lucky as the crowd were English speakers and they take heed to our comments.Beware of the lady attending to you, she was rude and abrupt.Well....  we were here for the Hanboks, just swallow what her comments were.", June 2019
26,4.0,Wonderful visit,"I went there after being rather unhappy with a museum visit. This place saved the day as it was a wonderful way to learn about more recent Korean history and understand how things moved there. The mixture of old traditional style Korean architecture with what came to be more fashionable once Korea was influenced by the west is a interesting sight to observe. By all means that time to sit and watch, observe the landscape.Though I did find it annoying that for the museum you needed to buy an extra ticket, so I didn't go.", June 2019
27,4.0,"Perfect visit, especially for seniors!","The palace, directly across the street from the Seoul City Hall and easily accessible using Exit 2 from the metro City Hall stop, is worth a 2 to 3 hour visit -- especially if one is a senior (65+) for which it is free of charge. The well preserved buildings interesting, as is the art museum which focuses on Korean painters -- a genre which is unfamiliar to many westerners (also free for seniors). Planning your visit around the changing of the guard ceremonies is prudent, as well.", June 2019
28,5.0,Volunteer guide made it perfect,"A high school student called Esther who is my volunteer guide made the trip perfect. She was able to explain about the different buildings, meaning of motifs and emblems, and story of the Princess. Weather is very good in June with sun and nice temperature. Just in time to catch the change of guards after my tour. Best experience, thank you!", June 2019
29,4.0,Changing of the guards,We didn’t go inside the palace but watched the lavish and dramatic changing of the guards at 3:30 (I think the other times are 12 and 2pm but check that if going). We get lucky enough to try on free Hanbok costumes to experience the change of the guards and pose with the guards after their ceremony. The whole thing lasted about 20 minutes and there were explanations in English. The outfits were colourful. There’s a huge drum that’s beaten too., June 2019
30,5.0,Holiday ,We went to Deoksugung. We were very lucky to be escorted by a volunteer guide. He was 16 years old and spoke good English. He took us through the various buildings of the palace and gave us a detailed explanation of the uses of the buildings and the history. This place was not to big and it was an excellent experience. Definitely worth a visit, June 2019
31,5.0,See changing of the guard ceremony,The changing of the guard ceremony takes place outside of the palace grounds in a small courtyard next to the sidewalk. You are very close to all of the participants who are in very colorful costumes.  Great for photos! The park like setting inside the gate is very peaceful. Hard to believe it just off a busy street., April 2019
32,3.0,A rather typical palace with small territory,"Dropped by here because it was on our way, and walked the grounds. A few beautiful nature corners and buildings are picture-worthy, as usual. Otherwise, not much to see here, but if it's on your way it's worth stopping by.", May 2019
33,3.0,Architecture ,A combination of Korean & Western-Styled Palace which makes me opened up my eyes 👀 Wonderful place to relax, April 2019
34,4.0,Great Han Empire Palace,Famous for its stone wall road and located at Seoul's busiest downtown intersection. You can watch the changing of guards ceremony here and don't forget to try walking on th4 stonewall walkway path., November 2018
35,5.0,Enjoyed the pictures with the guards,"The ground was not as big as Changdeokgung palace but it was one of our most enjoyable places visited in Seoul mainly because we were given free guided tour and we were also allowed free use of hanbok, the traditional South Korean dress. After the Royal Guard changing ceremony, there was announcement to  encourage picture taking with the palace guards which we did while wearing our hanbok.Tip:Changing of the guard ceremony is held at 11:00, 14:00, and 15:30 closed on Mondays. Try to get there at least an hour before the changing of the guard if you want a free guided tour. We were there just after 10:00am where we saw this youth group who are offering free guided tour. At this time, the group managing the free hanbok were not yet available. We took the tour which was only the tour guide and myself and my wife so it is practically a private tour. The guided tour took about 45mins.After the tour, we went out of the palace and proceeded to the stall of the group that is offering free hanbok. We registered, and was fitted with hanbok - both my wife and myself. We were wearing the hanbok during and after the changing of the guard ceremony and took plenty of pictures of us wearing them.Please note. The stall for the free guided tour and the hanbok experiences are NOT inside the palace. They are at the left front side of the palace gate.", April 2019
36,5.0,Cancelled Changing of the Guards,The scheduled Changing of the Guards was cancelled due to fine dust warning issued by the government.But the whole palace itself is a good attraction to visit., March 2019
37,4.0,I liked it here better than...,"...Gyeongbokgung Palace which I thought to be rather bleak (maybe stark). Then again maybe it was because I was on a tour there, and here  I was on my own.  Changing of the Guard Ceremony seemed more intimate here with everyone invited to take pictures with the guards.  I liked the Museum of Modern Art located on the grounds though there was nothing modern about the art at all. I didn't see anything less than a hundred years old in the place.", February 2019
38,4.0,Nice palace. Well maintained. ,"This was our first ‘self’ tour of the Deoksugung Palace. Interestingly the entrance fee was waived for the next few days, we got lucky. We also witnessed a demonstration right outside the palace. Lots of Korean and US flags. The palace ground is quite bare and brownish, I guess in winter it doesn’t look it’s best. What was interesting to do was play a few ancient sports that are on display and we made full use of trying some of the ancient games. The palace has an interesting mix of traditional Korean and Colonial style architecture.The law with the fountain area looks really nice and the Museum of Art is quite an interesting (albeit boring for kids) exhibition. It was a nice day to be out and about as the sun was shining bright on a cold crisp winter day. Worth a visit, check the box!", February 2019
39,4.0,Changing Guard Ceremony,We went Deoksugung Palace to see the changing guard ceremony at 11am ( only 15min ). First we went to the hanbok counter to get the free hanbok. We can choose the hanbok and we can wear it for photo around the gate for 10min. We took many pictures with the free hanbok., December 2018
40,5.0,I thought of the country's lost woes!,"It was a strange feeling because it was deoksugung which had come decades ago.  after the emperor Gojong was abandoned by the pressure of japan in the palace history guidbook, he lived here and was called Deoksugung palace. the name of the palace is not pleasant. However, we was doing the gate changing ceremony to remember tttttthe dignity of the palace. when the king was inhabited, could we go to the royal court as easily as we do now? the couple gave free admission togethere as a national merit.", January 2019
41,5.0,Fusion of Korean and Western Architecture,"Standing in the middle of one of the busiest city junctions, a visit to this place can be clubbed with that of City Hall. This Palace is considered one among the five grand Palaces of Joseon Dynasty. Located near the City Hall Metro station, this Palace complex houses a very well maintained garden, the National Art Museum influenced by the Western Architecture along with other traditional structures.The changing of guard ceremony is also held in this palace which is another major attraction for visitors.", May 2018
42,4.0,Palace very beautiful,It´s a very nice place to visit. This one is definitely definitely recommended to visit.The Emperor Gojong lived there when he’s old and passed away at that exact building, November 2018
43,5.0,Really love it!,"I seriously fell in love with the palaces in Seoul. This one is definitely definitely recommended to visit. The only palace where you can observe the King’s throne closely. Even though it’s pretty small compared to other palaces, it’s still beautiful. One of the building isn’t painted like other buildings, it’s said that the Emperor Gojong lived there when he’s old and passed away at that exact building. There’s a mixture between western and eastern architectures here. I will come back for sure and maybe will try to book a tour for the Daehan empire history museum ( the only building with western influences where Emperor Gojong used to live and entertain guests).", January 2019
44,3.0,Pick a spot facing the entrance gate!,"Arrived at this palace 15 minutes before the changing guard ceremony. What i can suggest, please pick a spot facing the gate as usually this side can get a first chance to take a pic with the guards and no crowd yet ;-)  One more thing, if you go inside the palace, for senior citizen (>65y.o) is free.", November 2018
45,5.0,Changing of royal guards is a must-do,"We went to see the changing of guards at 11 am. Very interesting ceremony, a loud English voice explains what is happening and afterwards pictures can be taken with the guards. Kids loved it too (6&4 yo); good to go 10-15 min before start to get a spot at the ropes.The palace and its garden are great to walk through. We visited on the last Wednesday of the month and it was free including the museum entered from the garden (some really interesting pieces). All in all a very entertaining morning.", December 2018
46,5.0,Explore beyond Deoksugung,"Deoksugung is the only palace in Seoul where you can experience being a Royal Palace Chief Gatekeeper and take an active part in the Changing of Royal Guards Ceremony (not just as a spectator). Unlike other palaces, you can also enter the palace grounds at night to enjoy a moonlit stroll. Currently, an exhibition of costumes and accessories from the K-drama Mr. Sunshine is being held in the palace. Beyond the palace, you can explore the historic neighborhood and the famous Stonewall Walkway along the palace walls. You can find film locations from K-dramas like Goblin. Find more tips on how to enjoy this palace and its neighborhood here -> http://bit.ly/DeoksugungTips", November 2018
47,3.0,Several buildings under renovation ,Changing of the guards was interesting! Like a short theatre production. Interesting history and buildings. Didn't stay long but unfortunately to walk around. Probably would have leqrnedy more if we rented audio guides or took one of the scheduled free tours., November 2018
48,5.0,Under Renovation,"This is probably the smallest palace in Seoul. But what you go there for is the changing of the royal guard ceremony. It happens right outside the gate so it's free. The ceremony takes place every 11am,  2pm, and 3:30pm. Be there 10-15 minutes before so you can get a good spot behind the cordon. They give you time to take photos with them too. Going inside the castle, you'll need to pay 1000 won (youth 500 won). Unless you're wearing a hanbik, then it's free! Some areas wereunder renovation when we visited. You need to walk around the palace and take photos in their stone walls!", November 2018
49,4.0,Close to City Hall Metro Stop,This palace is very easy to get to from the Seoul metro.  Changing of the guard is scheduled several times a day.  The guards pose with the tourists after the ceremony.Open and main building are lit at night.  Grounds have beautiful trees and walking paths., October 2018
50,3.0,Changing of Guard the Best Part,"I liked Deoksugung the least of Seoul's five grand palaces. That's because its myriad buildings present a mishmash of neoclassical Western and traditional Korean architectural styles. A palace since 1593, Deoksugung took on a new look in the early 1900s when King Gojong instituted a program of modernization and reform. In addition, during my October visit, a wall enclosed a large portion of the grounds, further detracting from a cohesive whole. Construction work was under way, with windows in the wall revealing only dirt and construction materials. I found the buildings interesting to look at separately, especially Jeonggwanheon Hall, a fusion of Western and Korean. The king drank coffee here and entertained guests. This small structure features a verandah and metal railings and fits in better with the Korean halls than with the massive  Western buildings. One of the latter  now holds the Daehan Empire History Museum and another features the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art. I came here on a weekday to watch the changing of the guard at the entrance gate and stayed to visit the palace itself. The guard ceremony proved to be absolutely spectacular with at least 50 participants dressed as Josen-era soldiers and bandsman in vivid yellow or brilliant shades of purple. The ceremony lasted about 10 minutes with a woman describing what was happening over a loudspeaker in English and other languages. She then invited spectators to approach the soldiers to take photographs. Excellent free brochures about the palace are available in English. Information signs, most with details in English, exist throughout the complex, and tours are available in English. The admission fee for adults is 1,000 KRW (about $1 U.S.).", October 2018
51,4.0,Historical,"Make sure to include this in your itinerary.Walking through the palace corridors, absorbing the rich history and imagining being there as well.", October 2018
52,4.0,A must visit Palace when You are in Seoul,This place is huge and take your own time in exploring these palace grounds. Good for a leisurely walk. It has many Palace buildings and a beautiful Garden., November 2017
53,5.0,Another lovely palace,I was walking by so I stopped in. Nice buildings and grounds and a very low entry fee. I was fortunate to see the changing of the guard on my exit., October 2018
54,4.0,Good walk with kids,"The Palace ground is huge where the palaces of each dynasty are spread over the whole area with the rock walls.interesting history of the palace and also the nice change-of-guards ceremony at the main gate.Good place to visit if one goes for a walking tour with City Hall, Arts Museum, Presidential Palace, the Stream and Insadong... for a day.the Palace entry tickets are definitely cheap and worth the 1-2hrs walkabout.", October 2018
55,4.0,"Interesting palace buildings, lovely tranquil garden","This palace and the surrounding grounds are much smaller than the nearby Gyeongbokgung Palace but it is still worth a visit if you have an hour or so to spare.We arrived just as the changing of the guard ceremony was starting (11am) which takes place just in front of the main gate. There wasn’t such a big crowd so we had a good view of the ceremony. After that we took a walk around the western-style garden and the interesting buildings in different architectural styles. Part of the site was under renovation but there was still plenty to see, including the Modern Art Museum.", October 2018
56,4.0,See this palace at night,"Since this is the only Seoul palace you can see illuminated at night, we walked through the Seoullo Sky Garden on both ends (blue lights come on) and then over to this palace nearby.  It was beautiful to behold at night.", October 2018
57,4.0,Enjoyable exploration of this temple complex,"This was the first temple we visited in Seoul and really enjoyed it. It's a pleasant place to explore and its quiet, given it's located in the centre of the city. The architecture is lovely and tranquil. Do try and come both by day and night as its wonderul when lit up too. Well worth a vist to see the beautiful buildings.", November 2017
58,4.0,Was hoping to see the changing of the guards. ,I think I might’ve missed the event. I only saw two guards at the gate and they look quiteordered. Enjoyed the visit and it’s nice grounds is that it’s under construction at the moment. Pretty buildings and peaceful, October 2018

61,3.0,Just watched the changing of the guard,"Didnt go into the Palace , but watched the changing of the guard at 11.00 hrs. Nice to watch with commentary in Korean, English and Chinese and Japanese.Dont panic about trying to get a good close up picture of guards, at the end of the ceremony, the ropes come down and you can take photos and walk in amongst them.Little great toilets in Berrys and bean on your left.......make sure you buy a coffee!", September 2018

64,3.0,A little old palace with changing guard ceremony,"It’s smaller than Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung, and Changgyeongung but still interesting. The location is near the Seoul City Hall. The most interesting things are the changing guard time and palace festival (usually around May or October). But for the other months, it’s not that worth it to be visited.", December 2017
65,4.0,Go for the changing of the guard ceremony,Small place which only takes half an our or so to walk around.  Not much to see inside.  The main attraction is the changing of the guard ceremony.  It was excellent.  Lots of interesting uniforms to look at and excellent drummers., September 2017
66,4.0,"Short visit, nice for a hot day","Deoksugung is a lot smaller than the other Seoul palaces (Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung) but it's still worth visiting. It's much more quiet and offers a break from the city on a hot day. Take you time and sit around for awhile, observing locals and enjoying the scenery. Since it's centrally located, Deoksugung also offers great views of traditional palace buildings with a bunch of modern skyscrapers in the background - a combination of old and new that makes Seoul so interesting.", April 2018
67,5.0,Love It,"Something is different here !The architecture style first, there is 2 building were build on European touch And there is one beautiful museum !On extra fees of courseSecond thing, the guard ceremonySuperb !On Morning it s around 11 am !Don’t miss it", May 2018

69,3.0,"Nice enough, but shouldn't be a priority","We visited as we had a little time and were in the area. It is cheap to visit, but there isnt much to see compared to the other palaces. The changing of the guard ceremony is fun to watch and there is an explanation of what is happening in English. There is some information about the buildings in English but not very much. I would say it isnt worth going if you only have a few days in the city, but stop by if you will be around for a week or more.", May 2018

86,5.0,Just at City Hall station,"Peaceful palace and nice scenery just at city hall station. Take a walk to rest your eyes from all the commercial signs.

Check time for performance at the main gate too.", February 2018
87,5.0,Great place to see a blend of the old and the new,Deoksugung Palace is a very unique place to visit for me. On one hand you have a great historical site and just beyond the walls of the palace is the ultra-modern Seoul City Hall and large hotels towering into the sky. The palace itself is a blend of traditional and modern buildings. The palace originated in the mid 1400's and continued to evolve in the 1900's so there is a mixture of buildings on the site. Great to see and well worth the 1000 Won entry fee. The palace is free for seniors., January 2018

94,5.0,Imperial Korea in the heart of Seoul,"The Deoksugung Palace was the home of the king of the Joseon Dynasty and was used as a residence of Emperor Sunjung right up until his death in 1919. The imperial buildings have been restored to their former glory and gardens that are well maintained. Guided tours are also available fpr groups, or just couples if you book ahead on the Deoksugung website.The grand Western Seokjojeon Hall is architecturally splendid. I would have loved to have been able to make it inside had I made a reservation (only 5 people are permitted) at a scheduled time on a first come first serve basis. Through the windows the banquet hall looked like the set of 'Downton Abbey'. It makes for utterly gorgeous backdrop for landscape photography.Its highly recommended to watch the Changing of the Guard procession  outside the main palace gates at 11am, 2pm or 3.30pm. Its a ceremony with lots of drums, flag waving, marching and military formalities stretching back over hundreds of years. Afterwards tourists are welcome to come and take photos with the guards. Finally, a great little tip. Make sure you check out the Jeongdong Observatory, located next door to the palace in the Seoul City Hall Seosonum Annexe Building. From the observation deck (18th floor) you can capture panoramic views of the Deoksugung palace grounds, CBD skyline, City Hall grounds and other landmarks - and its Free!

98,3.0,The remains of a historic palace.,"On a brief visit to Seoul earlier this year we visited the Deoksugung Palace. It is a collection of buildings some dating back to the sixteenth century, that have survived wars and some dismantling by the Japanese last century.

101,5.0,A rushed visit to the Secret Garden before huge downpour,"We managed to secure tickets for the Secret Garden in Deoksugung on our first day in Seoul and all other days for our Seoul trip was sold out. While the weather forecast was not good, we proceeded on to visit this palace and its garden.Of course, it would be a much better visit in gorgeous autumn weather, but we managed to enjoy the gardens and the castle complex with its spectacular foliage before the huge downpour. Do allow at least half a day in good weather to fully appreciate this complex.", November 2017
102,3.0,Disappointing,The backdrop with leaves etc was dramatic. But there really isn’t anything to see inside the structures and we could only appreciate from the outside. Wish there was more. The changing of the guards was a nice bonus., November 2017
103,4.0,Peaceful and beautiful,After my 16 hour flight and few hours sleep walking through a new city can be quite daunting but this was the best place I could have ended up the palace and buildings were lovely and there wasn't too many people. I was also there for the guards show which was also very entertaining, November 2017
104,3.0,For a night stroll,"I plan to go to other palace, but our dinner dragged on until 2pm. This palace seems to be the only one still open (without reservation).The lightning is not good enough so we weren’t able to truly appreciate the palace, but it’s a unique feeling strolling around the historic place at night.", October 2017
105,4.0,Elaborate Guard Changing Ceremony,"The Changing of the Guards ceremony was quite elaborate and more detailed than that of the larger Gyeongbokgung Palace.  Unfortunately, the viewing area was smaller so it was hard to enjoy all the pageantry, drills and musical instruments.  The grounds of this palace are adjacent to the City Hall so one sees the contrast of the modern and traditional buildings.", September 2017
106,3.0,A small palace,"Unless you cannot visit Gyeongbokgung Palace or Changdeokgung Palace, do not bother to visit here, as it is a very small palace.", October 2017
107,5.0,The best palace,"Of the five palaces in the heart of Seoul, the Deoksugung is probably the most interesting, even if it's the smallest site. But come at night. It's open until 9:00PM and looks particularly interesting once it's floodlit under the night sky. Some of the pavilion's are actually accessible (unlike any of the other palaces) and there are art displays to view. Plus, the main pavilion has the doors open to spy the intricate ceiling. The only snag of coming at night is that the on site museum is only open until 5:00PM. Buy the Palace Pass (it's W10,000 for the five museums and the shrine) to get the best deal.", October 2017

The Changing of the Guards is colorful and impressive and is worth scheduling your time to catch.", September 2017
110,4.0,Stay for the guard changing ceremony,"The regular changing of the guards ceremony is worth seeing, with an English language commentary. A very convenient location just across the road from Seoul city hall (and the city hall itself is worth visiting, the basement had an archeological display). As for the many temples we visited one tends to forget the specifics of each palace. I remember that one of the palace buildings had an organised tour (only way to get in) but this needs to be booked in advance. By the way I was entitled to free entry to many of the palaces and temples due to being over 65, a great deal! Worth a visit and easy to get to.", September 2017
111,5.0,Nice changing of guards ceremony,"We took the subway here and exited at City Hall station. It was a smaller palace complex but nice nevertheless. We came around lunch time and were fortunate to be able to witness the changing of guards ceremony here. It was a very colourful affair. Entrance was KRW 1000 which we reckon was cheap. As most of the main palaces were near each other, you can actually walk from one palace to the other, if you don't mind walking.", October 2016
112,4.0,Beautiful at night,"Although I unfortunately missed the changing of the guard, it gave me the opportunity to visit this place at night where everything is beautifully lit.

113,5.0,A step back in time,"It was very surreal for me to be walking along the same paths as many kings in the past. The buildings are truly impressive and certainly worth your time. A ticket to get in was 1,000 won, or a little less than a dollar. Soooo glad I came here!", August 2017

Anybody can visit the basement - not much to see there, particularly if you can't read Korean. The best parts are the first and second floors. But you have to book on the site webpage in advance. Or for foreigners there is a special rule to allow up to five to sign up on a waiting list, first come first served. This hall was built in about 1910 and is a mixture of western and Korean styles. The hall is now the Daehan Empire History Museum and is definitely worth a visit. The visit is guided and should take about 45 minutes.Time to visit would be up to an hour, longer if you go into the hall.", September 2017

THe knowledge imparted on that tour was worth more than what we paid to enter the palace. It gave the palace life and tangible history, a profound sadness and added to the beauty of what was once a royal palace during times of turbulence.", August 2017

121,5.0,Great place to visit!  Free to foreigners!,We visited this palace during a bright sunny day.  Encountered some outdoor traditional Korean entertainment during our visit.  It was a great experience!  On the good side of this visit is that the entrance fee is waived for foreigners and we could go back as many times as we wanted.  We opted to go back a second time during our stay in Seoul because we were with a local friend who couldn't enter one of the buildings without registering on-line., April 2017
122,4.0,Quiet place to visit in the evening!,"We visited many similar palaces all over the city where there were hundreds of people rushing about.

123,4.0,Nice place for chilling ,"Stayed for a few days in the Plaza hotel which is just in front Deoksugung and was curious to know what is insideEntrance fee is quite affordable and you get a decent guide for the different buildings, however personally I enjoyed much more relaxing under the shadow of the trees just enjoying the view than learn about the history of the place", July 2017
124,4.0,A combination of tradition and modern,"The palace was not too large, in compared with Gyeongbukgung or Changdeokgung, but it was easier to find as it was right out City Hall station and opposite the City Hall of Seoul. Half of the palace was as traditional as other palaces in Korea, but the other half was totally different with Western-style building, pond, fountain and garden that made me very impressed!", July 2017
125,5.0,A lovely park in downtown with some ancient palaces and temples,This place is an absolute must when in Seoul.

The palace has classy buildings and ground as well as wooded areas. Although this palace is not as popular with foreign tourists as Changdeokgung Palace and Gyeongbokgung Palace, this Deoksugung Palace is well worth a visit especially because it is so conveniently located in the city center across the City Hall, acting as a peaceful oasis for relaxation and reflection. You can also visit National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in the palace compound.The Changing of the Royal Guards take place in front of Daehanmun (Gate), which is quite colorful and popular ritual for many visitors and passersby.

130,3.0,More park than palace,"Very convenient to the CBD area and a short walk from some of the major hotels.  Lacks information and signage to give a feel for how the place looked in its prime and how the place was used.  Odd collection of buildings of various ages, some in traditional style and some in ""western"" (read brutalist ugly) style.  Worth a visit, but 30 minutes probably all you need", June 2017
131,4.0,Another splendid palace and grounds,Another one of the great Seoul palaces filled with grand colourful structures.

132,4.0,Central location and less crowded...,"Two reasons to visit Deoksugung Palace - it's centrally located next to City Hall right in the middle of the city, and it's less crowded compared to its bigger and more illustrious siblings. If you only have 1 hour to spare and would like to experience a Joseon Dynasty palace, this is it.

Not that big compared to Gyeongbokgung.", June 2017
135,4.0,"Smaller than Kyeongbokgung, but also less crowded.","I actually tell visitors to visit Deoksugung instead of Kyeongbokgung many times. If you want to see a palace, this is a good starter palace to see. You will not be walking in wall to wall bodies like at Kyeongbokgung. You get way more bang for the won, so to speak.  I was pleasantly surprised by Deoksugung.", June 2017

142,5.0,A different kind of palace,"Deoksugung has a different character compared to the other well-known Korean palaces like Gyeongbukgung or Changdeokgung. For me, this is mostly because of the mix of Eastern buildings next to Western buildings which are greatly influenced by neoclassical architectural styles. Deoksugung is also softer and feels less imposing than Gyeongbukgung, possibly due to the less extensive grounds.I visited Deoksugung in the cherry blossom season and it was lovely, especially in the sunset and as the lights started to come on. Deoksugung is the only palace that is open until 9pm all year round, allowing you the opportunity of walking in palace compound at twilight. It's pretty amazing to feel that you've been transported back several hundred years only to look up and see a modern building or sign in the distance.If you're not fond of mingling with the tourist crowd but yet wanted to visit a Korean palace, Deoksugung is ideal for its size, location (right next to City Hall) and character.", April 2017

145,4.0,Beautifully lit in the evening,"Deoksugung palace is one of the five grand palaces built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty. This palace is smaller than for instance Changdeokgung Palace or Gyeongbok Palace, but really worth a visit. Entrance tickets are really cheap and the buildings on the palace grounds are an interesting mixture of Korean and Eastern style buildings. The Deoksugung palace is also the only palace which stays open in the evening. A visit in the evening is highly recommended, because the buildings are beautifully lit.

146,5.0,Worth the visit,I decided to visit this palace quite last minute and was impressed by the architecture inside it (East meets West). The change of guard ceremony was a lot more impressive than the one at Gyeongbokgung Palace. Don't miss it!, April 2017
147,5.0,Lovely palace & grounds,"This was a lovely, well maintained palace & grounds. You can easily spend a couple of hours walking around, looking at the different buildings as the grounds are large. Very serene and peaceful even though it's in the city centre. I went early in the morning and avoided the crowds so got some great photos.", April 2017

149,4.0,Decided to visit this palace in walking distance from the Lotte Hotel,"This place is spotlessly clean, full of history, great palace and grounds. Takes a good 2 hours to do this properly. Great to see the changing of the guard and they are photo friendly, the cherry blossom was out.  Had a coffee at a nice place inside.  Well worth the walk.", April 2017
150,3.0,Small but worth to see. ,"It's not expensive for the ticket and you can walk around, enjoy the old Korean style palace. It took me just 20 minutes to see them all (as well as going to the toilet on the other side of the palace).", March 2017
151,3.0,Historic palace,"The Admission: 1,000 wonThe Palace: Originally built during the Joseon period, one of the historic palace. It is situation between modern buildings, interesting to see the old and the new in the same place. Beautiful architecture, great for photo opportunity. There is also a western style garden fountain, nice place to sit down, relax and enjoy the view. The changing of the royal guard ceremony that takes place every day at the main gate. Definitely must-see. You don't need to buy admission ticket to see this because it is right outside the palace. The Subway Station: Exit 2 or 12 of City Hall Station (Subway Line 1 or 2)", October 2016
152,4.0,Very Interesting with Cool Architecture,This was our first Korean palace experience. We enjoyed walking around the grounds. We went on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't very busy. I recommend adding this to your itinerary. Entrance fee is small and it's a great way to spend an hour or two., February 2017
153,4.0,One of the palace,One of the palace in seoul. Located in city hall. They have a changing of guard ceremony every day. Entrance fee is 1000 krw., August 2016
154,4.0,Can-do but worthwhile,"I would do Gyeongbokgung Palace and Changdeokgung Palace first. If you are then still keen on yet another palace, Deoksugung is a good choice. Much smaller than the other palaces, it is rather more intimate and there are less tourists. Also, it has not been rebuilt so the atmosphere is more historic than at Gyeongbokgung.", February 2017
155,4.0,Interesting! ,This is one of the most interesting Palace I have visited. History of it is good but the traditional and modern buildings within Deoksugung is more interesting. It shows how South Korea slowly learning from the western culture. Interesting place!, February 2017
156,4.0,just across the street,"I stayed in The Plaza Hotel so it is very easy for me to reach this palace. The buildings are well preserved and incredibly beautiful, exactly like what you see on the dramas or movies. Definitely clean and tidy in every corner of the complex. Too bad I only spent less than 1 hour in this place. I will advice you to spend at least 2 hours in order to really enjoy your moment there. It has particular times where you can see the traditional dance performance and palace guards' shift-changing ritual.", June 2016
157,3.0,Open until 9pm. Modern and Korean buildings. Watch the changing guard ceremony. ,"This was the last of the palaces I visited on the combination ticket. And I think only the changing of the guard ceremony was good. They have a few timings per day, so do check the schedule and watch it. Quite worth the spectacle. We caught the 3:30pm one. As we were early, we managed to join in the ceremony in traditional clothing. There's a booth at the side with free clothing available to try on. If you don't join in the ceremony, you can try the clothing for 3 min to take photos. It's free! Why not? Usual hanbok rentals start from 10,000₩ for 2 hours. The rest of the palace wasn't as nice as the others I went to, I feel. It also had some western style buildings built when Korea was trying to modernize. Abit odd. The inside of the colonial looking ""palace"" building can also be viewed but only 5 foreigners a day can enter with a reservation but the website doesn't load. I tried asking the counter staff but they said no, it's full already but Koreans could enter. Oh well. The plus point is that, if you want to visit a Korean palace and you can only do so after 4 or 5pm, this is the only one that is open, so you can enjoy this palace grounds in the evening. And it's only 1000₩ to enter. Cheap. Especially if you have no time for the other palaces, don't have to get the combination ticket.", February 2017
158,4.0,Check out the Museum,"As I have done most of the palaces, this one didn't have anything special, no must see factor until I went round the Historical Museum. This was the tick in the box for this Palace. The w1000 also includes the museum, and if you want to walk round head over as soon as you arrive and get yourself on a tour. It is access by tour only and they leave every 30 minutes, but gets full quick as the groups are only small. Shoes off and slippers on, they gave me an English audio so I could follow round, but obviously the passionate guide was giving the locals much more than I was hearing. All renovated in the last 10 years, but decorated as best as they could from old photos and with some of the original furniture. The history you get is the best thing and even some photos of the old emperors and emperoresses. Your 1000 doesn't also get you into the art gallery, that will cost you more.", February 2017
159,5.0,Interesting mélange of architectural styles,"Nice collection of palaces, both ancient and modern, eastern and western. Quite small compared to other palaces, but well worth visiting as so unique, making great photographic  juxtapositions. If visiting on the weekend, go up to Jeonddong Observatory beforehand so as to get a birdseye view in advance.", January 2017

161,5.0,The history is well preserved,This palace is downtown across from city hall.  They have a changing of the guard twice a day...don't miss it, January 2017
162,5.0,My favorite among the palaces,"While this palace doesn't have the sprawling grounds of some of the others - it is stunning. The lawns are so well-manicured, and the mixture of the architecture styles is quite interesting to see. Some of the more ""European"" style buildings were constructed on the palace grounds during the Japanese occupation I believe. there is also a small annex of the Seoul City Art Museum inside the grounds which holds small exhibitions. I got to see a gorgeous collection of antique Cartier jewelry by chance in there one day. Such a fun surprise. I would say this palace is a must see!", September 2016
163,4.0,"An urban ""spot of calm""","Being the ""smallest one"" among the four palaces I got to in Seoul (not sure how it compares in size with Gyeonghuigung which is the only one that I didn't get to among Seoul's five palaces), this is not a palace like Gyeongbokgung which is kind of ""a world of its own"" with its huge grounds where you'll get an ""immersion experience"" of the Joseon era days but what this palace offers ""just because of"" its significantly smaller grounds (compared to Gyeongbokgung) is nice ""contrasting views"" of traditional palace buildings & their modern high-rise counterparts right outside the confines of the palace grounds (including the interesting-shaped all-glass structure of Seoul City Hall which can be seen from the raised platform around the main palace building) which will kind of give you an idea ""how far"" Korea has come from those days of the Joseon Dynasty.  And those relatively small grounds of the Palace actually merge on one side (to the left of the main palace building while facing it, or equivalently to your right if you go all the way to the end of the pathway from the entrance gate after coming in from the street) with the grounds of a big museum with a lovely fountain in front although I'm not sure if the museum is considered part of the Palace (for admission purposes) or if it can be entered from another side.And unlike at the other palaces, the main building of this palace can be entered (not just to look at from right outside) so you can get a close-up view of the throne stage.  Also present here at the entrance gate are two or three ""ceremonial guards"" (didn't see them on the way in at about 10 am though, only saw them on the way out about an hour later), but I'm sure there's no big ceremony involving a lot of guardsmen in colorful attires with some holding beautiful flags as at Gyeongbokgung since there's simply no space here for such a ceremony.Coming by subway, City Hall Station (Lines 1 & 2) is where to get off, and you're pretty much right outside the Palace once you get out of the station onto the big street Sejong Daero (just a 1-to-2-minute walk to the entrance gate).  And, what I suggest for the ticket is getting an ""integrated ticket"" for 10,000 won (the equivalent of 10 US dollars) which is good for like a month and which gives you admission to four of Seoul's five palaces (except for Gyeonghuigung which I'm sure is a small one, maybe even smaller than this one) & Jongmyo Shrine; also do keep in mind that this palace along with Changdeokgung & Changgyeonggung are closed on Mondays whereas the main palace Gyeongbokgung & Jongmyo Shrine are closed on Tuesdays.", June 2016

166,4.0,A must visit!,"A nice architecture and you can also experience the guard changing ceremony here. However there are certain timing of when this ceremony will take place so you will need to do a bit of research. (went for 11am ceremony).

The English tour guide was knowledgeable, enthused and provided an overview in a manner that encouraged questions, allowing you to feel the Palace and hear the different spaces. For those of us who need to see, hear and read, the pamphlet available is well written and outlines in details the different Courts and Halls as well as the different time periods and what was taking place. With this being my first time to Seoul, it was a great introduction. Because it was a group of us, we made reservations to be hosted by a English speaking tour guide. And yes there is a small entrance fee. I hesitate to quote the amount here as who knows when it may change.", November 2016
169,4.0,A small Palace,A very small Palace but the Royal guard changing ceremony is good. It's the only Palace that has both Korean and western buildings. Same as Gyeongbokgung  if u wants to watch the Guard changing ceremony the time will clash with the guided tour so can only choose one., December 2016
170,4.0,Excellent for the value!,"I happened to go on the perfect day. I got there right when the changing of the guard was happening (happens at 11:00am, 2pm, and 3:00pm). And it was free for everyone that day (normal admission is ₩3,000). The National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Deoksugung  is free but you need to make a reservation for the Seokjojeon Hall: Neoclassical Western Style Building. This place is great to see the difference between modern and old but you'll be done in an hour maximum. Go to City Hall Station Exit 2 from Line 1 or Exit 12 from Line 2.", December 2016
171,4.0,Quick Immersion to Korean History,"Came to visit Deoksugung Palace as well as to witness the changing of guards ceremony, which was done thrice a day at 11am, 2pm and 330pm. Entrance ticket is attractively priced at 1k₩ for adult and 500₩ for child. The changing of guards ceremony is very spectacular. However, there is only Korean and Chinese narration provided during the ceremony, thus may have to read up the before the visit to fully appreciate. Overall, a good way to immerse the Korean history after days of city shopping.", December 2016
172,4.0,Palace in center of city,This Palace is across the street from City Hall.  It is not as large as the other palaces but has the Changing of the Guard Ceremony which is very interesting and if you make special reservations you can tour the European buildings from the early 1900's which is unique here.   Only 1000 won ($1) to enter--so worth it!!, November 2016
173,5.0,Deoksugung,I'm grateful that I visited this place during the spring season and witness the cherry blossom trees. It is also nice to watch the Royal Guard-Changing Ceremony in this palace., April 2016
174,4.0,Nice palace,"Seoul has many of them, this one is right next to the city hall, fee is less then a 1 euro, and you get a free 40 minute english guided tour, very nice. With guide is better, they has as well the change of the guard, which is interesting. Inside is as well a museam which has a extra charge if you want to go.Worthwhile to visit if you have time and the weather is nice", November 2016
175,5.0,Quintessentially beautiful ! ,"Staying right next door (The Plaza), I have no excuse not to visit this palace. In fact, it is the first palace I visited in Seoul. I deliberately waited to write this after visiting others. To me, this is the most quaint. It was the last day of autumn & I joined the morning English tour which was very informative. Especially on the Joeson Empire. Then I wandered into this part of the garden which took my breath away: the glorious colours of autumn. I bought the Royal Museum Pass. The MMCA in this palace requires a separate entrance charge.", November 2016

It has a palace with a central court, a bell building and a fountain. It is one of those that has been destroyed during the Japanese colonization and currently only a third of the original building is left, but what is left is worth seeing.", October 2016
179,4.0,I had fun!,"OK, I admit it - I was a lucky one.  But first, some background.  Outside the main gate, at certain times you'll have to look up, they have a stand for individuals to dress in traditional outfits and take photos.  This is timed to coincide with the changing of the guard ceremonies, replicating the traditional method of days gone by.  They select a tourist to participate.  Being selected made the visit inside even more magnetic.  It's not huge inside, but it shows some history, including some modern aspects.  If you like history, sign up for the Seokjojeon Hall (in advance on webpage).  It's newer but fancy.  If your time in Seoul is limited, you'd probably want to skip the palace tour.", October 2016
180,5.0,In the Heart of Seoul!,The palace is located right in the heart of Seoul. It is a nice respite from the busy urban area. Be sure and attend one of the Changing of the Guard ceremonies., October 2016
181,5.0,Charming palace with a human history,"The living quarters of Korea's first and last but one emperor, who enjoyed coffee. It's a charming place to visit, even if you're not interested in the history. If you love taking photos, it's a wonderful location. The trees are beautiful, and so many interesting details inside and outside the buildings.Honestly, I'm not interested in modern history (20th century), but I suggest you go with someone, who's well-versed in the life of King Gojong. It's a very human story, worth listening to.Occasionally (even on weekdays) there's a ceremony of changing the guards in front of the palace. Catch it if you can.", October 2016
182,5.0,A lovely place for a stroll ,Got some lovely photos of this palace. The buildings are beautiful and the grounds are lovely to stroll around. We spotted a couple taking their wedding photos in traditional garments. It's free to enter if you dress in traditional clothes too., November 2016

184,5.0,Less tourists is a plus,"Deoksugung palace is smaller than other palaces. But it attracted me more cause I could enjoy it with less people there. I was there when there's a ceremonial (not the guards changing)happened. It took place in front of the palace gate and they even had a parade on the street. No need to buy ticket at that time. I was so lucky I could enter the palace for free. By the time I finished going around, the parade just returned back so I could take more photos.The location is close to city hall.", October 2016
185,3.0,A good quick insight into old times Korea,"A visit to this palace gives the visitors a quick taste of the old times Korea of what it would have been. This palace comes complete with a regular show of the changing of the guards out the front about three times a day. The guards are part of the show rather than actual guards protecting the palace. There are quite a few ancient buildings which have been reconstructed, along with fountain & statues around the peaceful ground. Tip: We spent an hour wandering the ground to pass time, but a good tip would be to save some time to try on the free Traditional Korean costume dress up right outside the front for some photo opportunity. We found out too late that this great tourist experience was just outsider (and complimentary) when our tour bus arrived for the pick up.", October 2016
186,3.0,Change of the guard,"The palace itself is not very impressive, but the change of the guard is something. It takes place outside the gate. Well worth to see.

188,4.0,Good place to see changing guard ceremony,"I choose to see the changing guard ceremony in smaller palace because less people than in bigger palace like Gyeongbokgung palace and it's more comfortable for me since travelling with a baby.It was more than I expected.The ceremony was great. I can watch whole ceremony without difficulty because I am not that tall. They asked foreigner to hit the gong and asked them to wear hanbok during the ceremony.They were also hanbok free to wear near the ceremony area. You can wear them for free.

So it's definitely the place to go where lots of local children are also exploring their culture and history. My husband and I were here mid morning just missed the free English tour but that's ok. You can feel the history inside the walled residences. Also hang out for the procession it's pretty spectacular.", September 2016
196,4.0,A mixture of ancient and modern,The Deoksugung Palace is conveniently located next to the City Hall subway station. It is not a big as the other palaces like Changdeokgung or Gyeongbokgung palaces but is unique as it has 2 western styles buildings inside which was the residence of the royal family for a while. There is a tour of this residence which is interesting. The changing of the guards is definitely the highlight of the palace. From there I walked down to Sungnyemun Gate and Namdaemun Market., August 2016
197,3.0,peaceful garden walk in the afternoon,"We visited this palace in the afternoon on returning from a tour in Seoul. We realised that the museum was closed at 5pm, and unfortunately did not get time to revisit. The palace stands out in the middle of the city, as it is surrounded by modern buildings in the City hall area.We had an opportunity to walk the garden and view the architecture. This is the only palace where western style (russian) architecture may be found. This palace is also known as the west palace.The palace may be reached by subway line 1 City Hall, and exit # 2. It is open from 9am - 9pm, but closed on Mondays.Admission is W1,000 for adults and W500 for students. There are free english tours at 10:30am and 1/;30pm, and the changing of the guard ceremony is at 11am, 2pm and 3:30pm.This palace assumed importance after the Imjin wars (Japanese Invasions) in the 16th century. As the Japanese had burnt most of the seoul city gates and palaces, the King decided to live here until the main palace was repaired.The russian style buildings to the North of the palace compound, were built between 1900-1910, and there is a belief that there are secret passages from the palace grounds to the russian embassy. The pond and fountain in  front of the russian buildings is beautiful, and there is a hemispherical sundial that was invented in 1434.I hope to visit the palace again to see the changing of the guard, and experence the museum.", July 2016
198,3.0,Not much to see - except the changing of the guard ceremony,"We understand that this is the only royal palace which can be visited at night, illuminated. OK, we saw it by daylight. Japanese invaders did a fairly thorough destruction job and we could not visit the Western-style building as it takes only groups of 5 people at a time on a first come first served basis – and we were #7 and 8. As Seoul royal palaces go, this one is certainly not a must, but the very colorful procession of the changing of the guard, three times a day (11 am, 2 pm and 3.30 pm) is certainly worth the sight. The procession crosses the premises from the Western-style palace and heads for Daehanmun Gate, close to City Hall, where they perform some martial movements rhythmed by drum beats – a popular photo op, the more so that visitors are invited to join the guards for pics at the end of the show.", May 2016

As it was originally constructed as a residence not designated for royalty, Deoksugung possesses a humble quality enhanced by the beautiful foliage landscaping the premises. It is historically significant as the only imperial palace and the place where Emperor Gojong died in 1919. It is a beautiful mix of eastern and western architecture, a testament to Gojong's desire to lead Korea onto the world stage in the early 20th century. The thrice-daily changing-of-the-guard ceremony transports visitors back to the Joseon dynasty and is a must-see if visiting this palace. Admission is inexpensive and guided tours are free.

212,4.0,East meets west at this palace,This palace is unique in Seoul as it has some Korean style buildings and some western European style buildings. It is worth visiting to see the two styles together. A Korean art museum is also here and worth a quick look (if you come in the day). This is one of the few sights you can visit after 6 pm so you can plan this as the last sight of the day if you are in the palace area (unless you want to see the small but interesting art museum). Free guided tours are available and there is a popular changing of the guard ceremony several times a day., April 2016
213,5.0,A green spot in Seoul's concrete jungle,"I didn't expect much from this palace, it's small (a third of its original size) and gives an impression of a less-than-korean palace sibce there are modern buildings in itBUTIt has difinitely exceeded my expectation. Firstly, it was considerably less crowded than Gyeongbukgung, even in its peak time which is 11 am when the Changing of the Guard takes place. Secondly, the Changing of the guard is a wonderful experience, you can follow the marching band around and watch the change comfortably and then even pause a few times to let you take photos with the guards.Thirdly, the history of the different buildings that compile the palace is very interesting. One of the buildings is a fusion between traditional korean architecture and imperial architecture and to my opinion it was spectacular. For the meek price of 1000 won, I recommend going. I arrived around 9.20am so I even managed to get a free english tour with a guide before following the marching band.Overall I spent 3 hours exploring (including the guard change and half a guided tour).", May 2016
214,4.0,Lovely retreat from the bustle of Seoul,Spent a very charming hour walking around the palace looking at the buildings and soaking up the history. Its surprising quiet when you think it is just across from City Hall and has some lovely gardens to walk around in. Great to pop into as it is not a big palace (the smallest of the 5 in Seoul) and has some interesting recent history - the site of the joint Soviet - American commission in 1946 where the USA tried to get the Soviets to accept a unified democratic Korea., May 2016
215,4.0,Evening visit,After a long day and on my way to an evening flea market and some dinner I passed this nice little palace. Open until 21.00 hours and we'll lit it was little gem for a very little price., May 2016
216,5.0,Underestimated,It is smaller (now) than the other palaces but relatively uncrowded so you can explore easily. Great free English speaking guide and if you go to the main residence you may be able (as a foreigner) to book a time for entry. It is worth it and the free English audio is excellent.Not as grand as the Gyeongbokgung palace but rather restful. If you had time I'd do this first as the explained features are the same and the history of the murder of the Emperor's wife takes on meaning., May 2016
217,4.0,"Nature, Art and History Combined","The palace and its grounds are not as extensive as Seoul's other famous palaces, but it's worth a visit all the same. There are free tours in English so you can learn about the historical significance of each building. I skipped the tour, preferring to wander through the grounds myself just to appreciate the architecture and landscaping. If you're into museums, there's even a museum underground where you can learn more about the history of South Korea. The National Museum of Art is also accessible from the palace grounds and the structure is in stark contrast to the wooden structures of the palace.", April 2016

219,4.0,Out of my itinerary but glad we did go in and see. ,"We were just having some nice photo ops on the square of city hall when something caught our attention. It's the changing of the guard by the gate with their traditional colourful costumes complete with spears and flags. It was a good opportunity to have some photos taken with the guards which they offered to tourists even if you don't enter the compound. Nevertheless, we did and with a very cheap entrance fee who wouldn't (W1,000)? The garden that adorn the buildings are a great space to relax and enjoy looking at all the traditional Korean and European style architecture. There's a central water fountain in front of the museum and one interesting object that caught my attention was the sun dial which gives a very accurate time that I've compared with my iPhone. The museum charges an entrance fee but the other one is free but you need to book an entry online for they only limit the capacity. To get there, you have to get off from City hall metro station and exit next to the palace. There are several palaces nearby to explore too so enjoy it if you have time!", May 2016
220,5.0,Excellent visit,"What a deal!  People over the age of 65 gets in free!  Located right in the middle of the city.

It is very comprehensive and takes over 75 minutes, so be warned.", March 2016
221,4.0,Easy to Do and Highly Affordable,The palace complex comprises of many buildings (halls). It is so close to the City Hall subway station. The entrance fee is only KW1000 (very minimal isn't it?). The place is like a mini park and it would be nice to just sit down and relax there. The guards look interesting with their traditional dress. Ask the information center about the time for change of guard. It's unique and worth waiting for., May 2016
222,5.0,Beautiful architecture and a calm small garden.,Located in the middle of several touristic spots. This palace gives you the opportunity of scape of the big city and see some beautiful buildings.The entrance is very cheap. Around 1 US dollar. There's the change of guard constantly going on.

There is a separate art museum which charges an entrance fee. We got to see the paintings of a Korean artist, which were stunning.There was a concert of popular Korean music given on the grass in front of the museum.There is the possibility of visiting the Palace rooms. This takes a special ticket for which the concierge at our hotel arranged. It may be possible to arrange this per Internet.

226,4.0,"Interesting Location, Great Palace","You can't help but notice when visiting this ancient Palace that you are surrounded by modern day high rises in the heart of the city.  This was a very popular Palace for school children to visit as there had to be several hundred children on site.  The grounds are very nice and much bigger than expected.  There is a mixture of Western and Korean architecture.  Make sure to grab the brochure expaling everything at the entrance way.Definitely worth a look.

229,5.0,Very nice,"In my opinion this is by far the most interesting of the city center palaces.The place is very easily accessible from the city hall square. On a relatively small area you can enjoy various superb buildings from a mix of styles and epochs. If you have time there is an art museum and additional interior visits to do (needing a  reservation or luck!). The information given at the entrance and inside are basic but sufficient to have a grasp of the place's history. Well done. And if you’re into shows, you can even enjoy the colorful change of guard every hours!", April 2016
230,3.0,Good for a short visit,"This palace was just 5min from our hotel, so was able to visit in the morning before our departure.

This Ancient Palace is located in Seoul city surrounded by the modern urban infrastructure, it is near to the City Hall Station Sub-way. The palace belong to the Joseon Dynasty. You will feel very nice after entering inside, most of the area is surrounded by the plantation and in Autumn seasons different shades of maples pleasing the viewers, the nature lovers will definitely love this place. In a very big compound there are different types of building of 15th & 16th century, people who like to visit historical places & attraction, this place is definitely worth to visit, for close attention and details you should have sufficient time considering the opening and closing of the palace. There is museum inside (basement, 1st and 2nd floor) and to visit the place prior reservation is required via Deoksugung homepage.", November 2015
233,4.0,Worth seeing,"A nice example of the palaces but time your visit to watch the changing of the guard. It is very colorful and adds to the ""ancient"" feel of the palace. One of the buildings house the National Museum of Contemporary Art.  Worth a couple of hours.", January 2016
234,5.0,Changing of the Guards,"This Palace, one of four major Palaces in the same vicinity in Seoul, is pretty much directly opposite City Hall, and there's a metro station at City Hall, so it's easy to get to and find.This is a smaller Palace than some of the others, and has a few more later-built buildings, so is quite distinct from the other Palaces.The Palace guards are interesting to see and photograph, and you don't have to buy a ticket to go into the Palace to see them, as (for obvious reasons) they are on the outside of the gate.  They are used to having their photos taken!As a consequence, you can also see much of the changing of the guards from the street too, free of charge (much like Buckingham Palace).  And the changing of the guards at Deoksugung (and at Gyeongbokgung, not far up the road for that matter), has just as much pomp and ceremony, with colourful uniforms and a marching band, as Buckingham Palace or Horseguards.  Well worth a look if you can time it right.", March 2016
235,5.0,Watch the changing guard,"We watched the full changing guard ceremony and got the chance to wear Korean hanbok free for tourist (before entering the gate, there's a booth on the right that provides Korean traditional clothes for tourist to wear, just need to fill out your name) and took a photo with the head of guards. The booth closed around 2 or 3 pm. Very memorable!", March 2016
236,4.0,Nice Place to see,I was glad to see this palace just wish it was in the day not night time even though the lighting was kind of nice at night., February 2016
237,5.0,Palace worth a visit,"There are other main palaces that are closer to each other and make it easier for people to do palace tours at the same day, and Deoksugung is often left out because it is a little far and in different direction. But it's right across Seoul city hall and very easy to find. It has nice parks and very unique because it has museums within it too. During weekends and holidays I think there are highschool student volunteers doing English guide. I went in August 15th, the Korean Independence Day, and they opened for free. There will be some other national holidays when they open for free so check it out before the visit.", August 2015
238,4.0,Worth a detour,We stumbled on this palace on our way from Namsan Park to Gyeongbukgong Palace.  It costs about $2 USD to enter the palace and it is certainly worth it.  Spend about half an hour wandering the beautiful grounds., March 2016
239,4.0,Palace that Function,"Deoksugung being the latest palace built, the buildings scatted throughout the huge ground were very functional.  Instead of the traditional building of ceremonial displays, this palace has open room in serving for the purpose of daily activities.  The gardens surrounded the palace are very well landscaped and can be maintained with minimum labor.  However in walking through the various gates between the courts, visitor must be aware of the low ceiling that easily knock one's head if not careful.", February 2016
240,4.0,Excellent venue with Palace and changing of the guards,"Easy to reach by metro. Buy a combination ticket for all the palaces and jongmyo for 10.000 KRW. Ther is a small empire museum in the basement, the larger palace museum is only open for guided tours.The changing of the guard is a nice show to see. Most of the action takes place outside the Palace ground, in front of the main entrance, so better try to be outside than inside to see the ceremony.", February 2016

243,5.0,Made it to the guard changing ceremony at 14:00,"Exclusive and free experience that you can watch in front of the palace's gate. Just curious that some performer are westerner dressing in an old traditional Korean guard uniform, I found it a bit strange.", February 2016

245,5.0,First on Itinerary,"As it was quite near our hotel, this was first. We chanced upon a Changing of the Guards ceremony and it was quite interesting and the colors were fascinating. We toured during the MERS scare and there were not a lot of tourists around. Our photos were quite nice as it appeared like we were the only ones around. it's a small palace and it's something you can quickly finish up in an hour or two.", June 2015
246,4.0,Good palace amazing change of guards,"This palace is an ocean of serenity in the middle of a very busy part of Seoul and while the palace deserve a visit as it is, the change of guards is a fantastic sight to see, great and a fantastic recreation of Korean history", February 2016
247,5.0,Small and manageable with kids,Stayed about 2 hours which about tested the limits of a 3yo. Nice microcosm to see what a Korean palace is like without having to travel too far and having to feel obliged to walk the extensive grounds of a bigger palace like changdeokgung, May 2015
248,4.0,Good-size Palace for family,"We choose to visit Deoksugung because of its size. We would like to be able to tour the ground and thought that Gyeongbok and Changdeok is too much for our group of elderly and small children to walk through and cover all.We arrive exactly as the changing of the guard ceremony is about to start at 11 am and lucky enough to find a booth in front of the main gate that offer services of young korean student for a free tour to tourist. They were official and looked very professional with their orange uniform and obviously they get the support from the local govt. The purpose is to practise their english with foreigners and to learn more of their own culture, which I thought were very nice.Sara, our guide was only 14 years old, about the same age as my eldest daughter, thus they were instantly having a girl talk :) she showed us around the palace complex, stopped every now and then to explain about the buildings and their history.The complex also has a museum, but we choose not to go in so cant comment on that one.", January 2016
249,4.0,Serene Seoul ,It does not get more central than this and the daily changing of the guard ceremony is fund to see as well. The main temple building is lovely but there are a few unique things to see here:The small lake garden section in front of a tea house / gift shop is one lovely aspect. The 19th century pagoda with hints of iron Eiffel era railing is particularly unusual and distinguishes parts of this complex from the other temples and palaces. It is the last hint of the final Korean royal family., January 2016
250,3.0,Palace in the middle of the city,"The guard changing was interesting, tradition passed down though generations, guards in traditional clothings, martial art demostration.  There's a carpenter outside the wall. Need to buy tickets to enter premise. More of preserved architectures, for photography. Not for wet weather.", December 2015
251,5.0,"Interesting show of changing guard, free guide and hanbok wearing experience",I recommend everyone to see the guard changing ceremony. It is pretty fascinating. They are actors but it is nice to see the tradition is still preserved. There was yellow booth set up beside the entrance so you can try hanbok or traditional Korean clothes for free and get to take pictures with the guide while wearing it. I recommend to get the free volunteer guide before you get in. Ours was a high schooler with excellent English and he gave a lot of good explanation and insight of the palaces and Korean culture. I love how the public restroom was warm and has heated water. Got to escape the coldness outdoor for a little bit., January 2016
252,4.0,good,"located near the city hall, good to walk around and see korean palace. Convenient access but nothing much to do there.", January 2016
253,5.0,Palace with Asian and Western architecture,"One of the ""Five Grand Palaces of Joseon Dynasty”, is easy to access as it is located in the city centre in front of Seoul Plaza and City Hall.I really recommend to check out official information about time of changing guard ceremonies (we saw one at 14:00 and it was the biggest performance - took around ~30 mina - with also music show and martial art show). They are WORTH watching. Tourists are also encouraged to take photos with the guards :)For palace itself it is a big complex with both Western and Asian architecture. Additional Western-style buildings were added during Korean modernization period in XIX/XX century.Highly recommend to visit this palace!", October 2015

256,3.0,Ancient Palace within the Metropolis,"This palace is within walking distance from the City Hall Station.  Had I not visited Gyeongbokgung the next day, I would have rated it very good.  Somehow, the modern cityscape surrounding the palace ground spoils the flavor of the traditional palace architectures.The Royal Guards changing ceremony is a must watch if you do not plan to go to Gyeongbokgung.  Do check out the schedule in advance so that you can optimize your time.  Be at the entrance before time so that you can watch from a good spot.  The schedules during our visit in the last week of Oct-15 were 11 am, 2 pm, and 3:30 pm.  The ceremony last for 30 minutes and I found it a bit lengthy at the end.  The colourful costumes of the Royal Guards make some of the otherwise plain photos stand out.It is also worth to pay a visit to the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art which is also inside the palace compound.  If you’re here at the right time during autumn which we obviously were not, you should be able to see a blaze of vibrant autumn colours.", October 2015

258,4.0,A great look at Korean history,"It might not be the most impressive of the palaces in Seoul, but it's still worth a visit, and entry really doesn't cost much at all. You probably don't need to spend much more than an hour there, and definitely not more than two, but the architecture alone is worth the price of admission, even without taking into consideration the historical importance of the palace. Signs are in English, Korean, Japanese, and Chinese, so almost any visitor can learn about the historical details.", November 2015
259,5.0,Small but cozy palace,"This palace is nearby cityhall and good for take a rest from crowded seoul. In addition, can feel the real historic palace.", July 2015
260,3.0,"A nice place, probably better in spring or summer though.","It was a very cold day - 0 degrees so my walk around the grounds was brisk! The entry fee is only 1000 won (about $1.50 AUD) so inexpensive!There are free tours leaving twice a day and there are brochures just inside the gates in English. There are a number of plaques dotted about that have a short paragraph in English explaining the relevance which is very useful. Overall it is a peaceful place that was largely empty in December and is was easy to stroll around and look at the gardens (although they are pretty bare in winter). The grounds also house the Daehan Empire History museum, which has tours of the 1st and second floors of the palace (I peeked through the windows, was worth a look if you like palaces!) and you can reserve your place in the free queue almost every hour - I didnt know this before I went, so the tours were full. Check it out before you go, the rooms looked lovely. In the ground level was a  museum about the history of the dynasty? I'm not really sure, there was an english brochure which didnt explain much and none of  the displays had english translations so I am not sure what it was about. Give it a miss if you are in a hurry, although it is nice to get in outside from the cold. The changing of the guard was at 11am and I was able to see them marching from behind the hall, all the way through the gardens to the outside gate. Ignore the cheapskates who say to not pay, go in and see it! It was a good spectacle. Allow about an hour, and there are plenty of toilets and drinking fountains throughout as well as a few vending machines if you want a quick drink or snack.", December 2015

262,3.0,Average Level Palace,Not really that impressive. Can cover the palace ground in less than an hour.However the changing of the guard is quite interesting. It can be viewed at the entrance of the palace and hence not necessary to pay the 1000 won fee. It's done 3 time a day., December 2015

It gives you a taste of what the palaces were like back in the time of the Joseon Dynasty.  This palace complex is compact, all the sites are within easy walking distance of each other, and the signs are in English as well as Korean.  It is easy to get to either by subway or via the ""Hop on, Hop off"" city bus tour of Seoul.  Consider a visit here if your time in Seoul or interest in Korean palaces is limited.

268,4.0,Beautiful palace during fall foliage season,"Deoksugung (₩1000 for adults) is one of the Five Grand Palaces of the Joseon Dynasty, located next to Seoul Plaza and City Hall in the city centre. Opening hours are 9am to 9pm (closed Mondays). This palace served as the residence of the Royal family twice, during late 16th century and then again at the turn of the 20th century, providing well preserved buildings of traditional Korean and Western architecture. Here you will find a collection of traditional Korean style entrance gates, lovely inner courtyards, worship and residential halls, pavilions and landscaping, all quite similar to what you see at the much larger Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung Palaces. You can also watch  Changing of the Guards ceremonies here at Daehanmun Gate.  Two unique inclusions at Deoksugung include the Western style buildings at Seogeodong Hall, which was built in European style in 1910, and the adjacent building used to house the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (MMCA) - Deoksugung branch.  One of the things we very much enjoyed about visiting Deoksugung during the autumn was the fantastic fall foliage display seen throughout the palace grounds. There were numerous spots where we found multiple colours of tree leaves that made for lovely photographs. The autumn scene here was considerably more impressive here than at other palace grounds visited during this trip to Seoul. We were however, disappointed to find the MMCA Deoksugung Art Museum closed during the time of our visit. There was no indicated closing on the MMCA or Deoksugung websites nor at the place entrance, which was odd.  Overall, we quite enjoyed spending time at the Deoksugung Palace. Not only was it  exceptionally beautiful this time of year, but, we found it more management a place to visit compared to larger palace grounds around Seoul. You can comfortably browse Deoksugung in 30-45 minutes or longer if you want to visit more leisurely.  This is a very good and cheap attraction visit to consider making during trips to Seoul.", November 2015

278,4.0,Lovely Look at a Historical Palace,This looked like one of the smaller palaces but it provides a lovely glimpse of old traditional historical palaces looked like. We went on a quiet day so didn't get swamped by crowds., March 2015
279,2.0,Too Little Korean Flavor,"As far as Korean historical sites in the area go, this is one of the least attractive. First There is a lot of ongoing consruction which always seems to interfere with photos. Also, there is a lot of more Western buildings which housed legislative offices. If life mited on time I would opt out of this site for the more beautiful Changdeokgung Palace and the Secret Garden. But if a history buff, it is worth a visit.", October 2015
280,4.0,Nice quite stop visit ,"This is a nice place, but there areBigger palaces in the city. 1000 won very reasonable admission. Nice to take a stroll down to Myeung Dong area from here.", October 2015
281,5.0,You'll pass by this Palace en route to Namdaemun.,"If your plan includes Namdaemun Market, then it is very likely that you'll walk past this palace.  Therefore, I'll highly recommend you pay a visit to this famous landmark and soak in the ancient context behind Korean royalty many centuries ago. The most unique section in this palace is the attached Western, neo-classical European styled buildings. This is a stark contrast on the conventional and traditional Chinese-styled palace facade.", October 2015
282,4.0,Fine!,This is also known as Gyeongun-gung Palace. Its one of the 5grand palaces built by the kings. It has garden forested around and also has a square with the statue of King Sejong the Great!, August 2015
283,5.0,Beautiful palace,This palace is a quick walk from my hotel so had to visit en route to Namdaemun market. Beautiful grounds!, October 2015
284,5.0,Must watch music show!,"This is the palace I visited other than Changdeokgung. It was not as big as Changdeokgung or Gyeongbokgung. But inside there is a combination of old palace and modern-looking palace (plus a modern contemporary art museum).At the beginning, you can watch changing of guards. And that day (Friday, October 9th 2015) at around 12-1 pm, there is a traditional (+modern fusion) music show. MUST WATCH! I'm not sure if it's held everyday/not.", October 2015
285,3.0,More of a leafy refuge than an impressive sight,"At the time of my visit, the main hall was completely under wraps for renovation.  That said, you may find – as I did – that this compound offers more of a cool, leafy break from frantic, downtown Seoul than a serious competitor to the other of Seoul’s palaces.  It has very much of a park-like layout that seems to encourage relaxing and strolling.  The two main structures at the time I was there were the completely incongruous neo- classical Museum of Modern Art and Royal Museum buildings – two structures which look like they’d be more at home in Washington D.C. than in Seoul.The entrance fee is very modest (I believe 1,000 Won) so it is not a great financial investment to check it out, particularly in the middle of a hot day.  I don’t know if it is worth a special trip, but if you have other sights nearby lined up, then it’s logical to stop in.", September 2015
286,4.0,A nice palace,"This is included if you get the combination Palace pass. It is near City Hall. It is very much like the other Palaces, but very nice. On reflection I would not get the combination pass as in my opinion you do not need to see them all, as they are much the same.", October 2015
287,3.0,An interesting palace if you like history,"My parents and I visited this medium sized palace on a sunny day and we saw the changing of the guards parade which was quite interesting although it gets draggy after a while.  You can take photos with the guards at the entrance and if you have children the guard will pose for you as well (unlike the stiff royal guards at the Tower of London). This place is for you if you enjoy photography of architecture and outdoors. There is a cafe and resting areas within the compound but there are lots more eateries including Dunkin Donuts just outside the entrance (you can find a seat there facing the entrance, and when the changing of guards ceremony starts you can enjoy the whole ritual while you munch your donuts but chances are the tourists will block your view).  There is a contemporary art museum located within the compound and also another historical building inside but I found the former a little boring, and the latter only allows guided tours at specific hours which you need to book in advance because of restrictions in group size.", September 2015
288,4.0,Cultural & Traditional,Interesting place to visit....Very traditional and cultural. Accessible from main street and close to amneties, August 2015
289,4.0,Very inexpensive cultural attraction in Seoul,"Since I went to this place on Chuseok, it was actually surprisingly free of charge! I suppose it was a kind of promotion? I hear it's 1.000 won on other days, which is about 80 American cents by today's conversion. Regardless, while wandering around Seoul trying to find places to visit over the busy Chuseok holiday, we ran into the Deoksugung palace, and though we couldn't go inside the palace part itself - which is fine, as many palaces tend to look very samey - we were able to see the royal gardens (uninspiring as they were), the sundial next to the big, beautiful fountain in the pond, and the art museum. The art museum was the best part, along with taking a picture with the guard standing at the entrance to the whole attraction. :D", September 2015
290,5.0,Peaceful once inside the beautiful grounds,We watched the changing of the guards. The walk along the tree lined path was lovely along the way to see all the cravings on the buildings . At the end was a pond and and the 2 huge buildings were amazing . One holds works of arts the other was a home but we could not get in as you have to make a appointment to see all inside or as a tour . The ground s are beautiful and peaceful away from the traffic of the city, September 2015
291,4.0,Good primer on palaces,"More compact than other palace sites, and has one modern palace on site. If you are short on time, this should be your one palace visit.", September 2015
292,5.0,My favourite Palace im Seoul,This is my favourite palace of Seoul. It's not to crowded and the mixture of western and korean architecture is simply awesomeEntrance fee is very reasonable (1000₩ for adults), September 2015
293,4.0,An interesting contrast,It was interesting to see this traditional palace sitting among all the sky scrappers.  Hopefully you'll have a tour guide that can give you some of the history about the place., September 2015
294,3.0,Where Tradition and Modernity Intersect,"Deoksu Palace served as the king's residence twice during Josecon.  The site was originally the home of Prince Wolsan, and King Seonjo lived here temporarily after returning to the capital following the withdrawal of Japanese forces in 1593.", September 2015
295,3.0,Was okay,"Smaller than Geongbukkung (not sure I spelled it right). It has its charm, but the great palace is better. ", August 2015
296,4.0,A quiet & small palace,"As my aged parents couldn't walk alot, so we chose this palace to visit. We went there to watch the guard-changing ceremony. It was interesting & we enjoyed the short martial art performance too. After that, we went in & take a slow stroll around. It was quiet & not so many", June 2015
297,3.0,quiet and peaceful palace,"if I compare Deoksugung to the other palaces, Deoksugung is quiet and peaceful, but the scale and size is small so it's not that dynamic and exciting.", March 2015
298,5.0,Quiet osais in Seoul,"Unexpected quiet and serene palace beside a main 10 lane road. The serenity was so relaxing. The palace building were impressive. However the best thing was the changing of the guard ceremony at 11am. I did not know about it so was surprised, when nearly run over by the parade.", August 2015
299,5.0,Sejong-daero,For a reasonable price they take you back in time to enjoy Korea in the feudal ages. As one of the oldest castle is a must see attraction. , September 2015
