0,3.0,Art museum tour,Good for art people.  Too difficult to understand for us.  There are free lockers on first floor to keep a large bag and coat., December 2019
1,3.0,Nicely designed building ,The building and the surrounding are interesting enough to give the museum a try even if the collection/ installations are of unequal interest., November 2019
2,3.0,I’m too old for this,, October 2019
3,5.0,"Really cool, absorbing, incredible visit","Take subway to Anguk, setting is restful. Museum spreads to outside. Exhibitions, installations are huge, well displayed! I had lovely inexpensive meal at canteen. Then bought lots of gifts in Gallery.  Outdoor have been there longer. Believe there is bus to visit another branch of this esteemed museum?", June 2019
4,4.0,Learnt about contemporary Korean artists,A retrospective about an artist I did not know was very impressive - including the 'painting table' set up. Then I happened to see the artist at a talk about his work. The museum has several larger exhibits running in separate exhibition spaces + a cluster of galleries is nearby for more visits., July 2019
5,4.0,Excellent venue for Modern Art - Worthwhile stop while in Seoul,, August 2019
6,4.0,Useful for general development!,"I was brought up on classical examples of art and painting, so not everything in the exposition was clear to me. But, I think, more progressive young people will be interested in this museum, as an example of the avant-garde trend.", July 2019
7,5.0,Wonderful space,, June 2019
8,3.0,"Good venue, but only 3 Galleries open :( - hence, Average.","1 Adult went alone.  It cost Won 4,000 entry, but only 3 of 7 Galleries were open :(  The Duchamp exhibition had just closed :(  However, of those open, I enjoyed them - particulary Zach Blas idea of 'facial masks' to confuse CCTV cameras (good one!!) and Simon Denny to finally explain what Blockchain/Bit Coin technology really is!  I also enjoyed Cao Fei's idea of using an automatic cleaning machine within a restricted platform to demonstrate today's China: rapid economic development yet contain social conflict with generation gap contradictions.  Very good location for walking to historic village nearby (Bukchon Hanok Village) and a lovely Korean restaurant (the man outside wears a Panda outfit!), just beyond Pink Butter café, opposite the national Library/Digital Archive Building.  (Another great peaceful place to study)", April 2019
9,5.0,A quick art run after visiting the Gyeongbokgung Palace,, March 2019

12,4.0,Very Interesting displays,this museum is great i went when it was raining and directly at the entrance they had bags for wet umbrellas and free lockers which was great! the exhibits were all very interesting and i got an English listening guide as i was walking around. defiitely worth braving the rain for., December 2017
13,4.0,For the modern art lover.,, May 2018
14,4.0,Interesting,"It was an interesting museum. Though, most of the displays were slightly too dark and/or disturbing. It's a really big museum, with modern spaces. The exhibits and exhibition style was interesting too. Their souvenir shop is pretty cool though.", February 2018
15,3.0,Boring ,, February 2018
16,4.0,Interesting though only one gallery open,, March 2018
17,4.0,Temp exhibitions in a Conveniently located museum with nice exhibition spaces,, January 2018
18,4.0,"Good Museum, but not that inspiring","Interesting museum, and many of the exhibits were short on inspiration and quite ""average"". However, some were quite interesting conceptually. I would say nothing was absolutely riveting here...", October 2017
19,5.0,excellent museum - would highly recommend visiting,, December 2017
20,5.0,If You Speak Art.....,"... You don't need an audio guide. There is free admission on the last Wednesday of the month and one exhibit we saw focused on up and coming Korean artists. The exhibit showed the state of mind of Korea right now. It was more insightful than reading a book or talking to Koreans. Evocative and yet not too complex for normal folks. Staff was excellent, kind, and helpful. The only problem we had was finding the front entry door because we had walked north from Insadong. A must see in Seoul!", October 2017
21,4.0,Seoul Modern Art Museum,This museum has interesting collections. Location is easily accessible. In each hall it is possible to find English speaking gentle staff. Also it is possible to find printed information on exhibitions., October 2017
22,4.0,Drop by!,, August 2017
23,5.0,One of many good museums.,I have been to many museums in Seoul now and this is a good one.  Not very big but still good.  And in a very good location next to the most popular place in town and less then 10 minutes walk from the King Sejong and Admiral Yi statues and museums., July 2017
24,5.0,Top-level curation,"This MMCA location showcases Korean art, and they also get high-quality international exhibits.  A slightly awkward building, but that is to quibble.  Absolutely worth a visit if contemporary art speaks to you.", June 2017
25,5.0,Fantastic museum of contemporary art,"Count in spending several hours here to see the huge display if contemporary art, mainly Asian. It is a world class museum. The only drag for non Koreans is that the audio guide has a bit of info on just a few works, and there is minimal English signage otherwise. Still, if you have any interest in contemporary art make sure you come here. Conveniently, the very good Arario Museum in Space, also focused on contemporary art though with a more western orientation and better English signage, is just up the road.", July 2017
26,4.0,Excellent Contemporary Art Museum,"f you like contemporary art this is a ""must see visit"" in Seoul.  Starting with the architecture of the building and the exhibitions rooms everything is great, particularly if you want to have a large vision of contemporary Korean art. The place is really big and consents the presence of very good installations. The museum is located in a nice area, in a cluster of many beautiful and interesting art galleries, cafes and restaurants.", April 2017
27,5.0,Great venue and great exhibitions,, April 2017
28,4.0,Great place to wonder around and get inspiration,quiet and impressive museum with lots oxf Asian artists. Great to walk around for 2 hrs and get some modern inspiration., March 2017
29,5.0,You should not overlook this small little jam!,"This museum is situated in the northern part of Seoul.  The museum is very close to the Kyungbok palace which was the main palace during the last dynasty of Korea.  The museum's construction concept is ""Multiple Islands surrounded by sea (actually developed into small open yards following Korean traditional construction concepts and this open areas are very good space for large sculptures, etc.  The museum's display of modern contemporary arts periodically reorganized and designated inner spaces are decorated by carefully chosen artists supported by large corporations of Korea.   As a local I strongly recommend to visit this place if you have a plan to visit the the main palace area.  There are small but nice Korean traditional food restaurants nearby this museum (also the very children-friendly place).", January 2017
30,3.0,Just don't get modern art,"Only went in as it was free over the CNY holiday. I just don't understand why an empty room is art. Or a room full of clay balls. There are a few pieces that are interesting to look at but for the most of it, if your 5 year old produced it you would be happy, but you would not make a room full of it and call it art.", January 2017
31,4.0,near to Gwanghwamun palace,, November 2016
32,5.0,Good exhibitions,"Good Korean exhibitions, some of them are interactive. A different insight into Korean culture. Close to other tourist attractions.", November 2016

34,5.0,Fantastic Exhibitions of International artist,Great museum with very large exhibitions of Modern and Contemporary International artists. Great place to see if you like art, October 2015
35,4.0,As the name suggests,"It's a huge space for exhibiting modern and contemporary art mainly. The MMCA Seoul branch offers a spacious courtyard, some gift shops, a theater and a cafeteria among some other shops. The location makes it even more attractive, it's right next to Gyeongbokgung Palace and other main attractions. There's a small admission fee which is totally worth it, considering that they've brought the works of Gilles Barbier, William Kentridge and Leandro Erlich before, just to name a few. Personally, I love the surrounding areas but I find the architecture of the very building somewhat cold and orderly. Interestingly, it used to be the old Defense Security Command building.", August 2016
36,4.0,Some interesting artworks.,"It is questionable whether all the pieces on show are worthy of the name 'Art'. Whilst it begins well by showing how a craft can become an artwork, it seems to develop into a need to fill space with projected images and other video films which are not worthy of the space dedicated to them. Fortunately there is a cafe and cafeteria on site where one can review the different exhibits.", September 2016
37,3.0,"Good souvenir shopping any time, choose your moments for the exhibits","The repurposed ship's hull at the entrance is intriguing and inviting, and the gift shops full of well-designed traditional and modern goods are good hunting ground for souvenirs. But check the current exhibitions carefully before paying to see inside. There is no standing collection and when we went the temporary exhibitions were extremely sparse and underwhelming - just one work worth seeing, and room after corridor after atrium of empty space.", August 2016
38,3.0,Big Empty Space,, August 2016
39,4.0,A Big Art Gallery,"More than a museum this place looks like a big art gallery. If you like contemporary art, you will find beautiful and stunning works. 1.5 hours to see it all. Cafe for food on site. Open from 10-6pm (tickets will stop selling 1 hour before closing time - Wednesday closing time is after 6pm and admission is free every last Wednesday of the month). 500m walk from Anguk Station Line 3 exit 1.

41,5.0,Impressive,, July 2016
42,4.0,modern and contemporary art of korea,"This museum was open last year. It is near insadong and samchungdong. If you are interested in modernart, go MMCA. Near MMCA you can see many galleries, so after you see mmca, go sime galleries. Usually it is open until 6. The last entry time is 5 maybe.more information go hompage.", May 2016
43,4.0,OK experience,"The museum has quite a number of spaces for exhibition, but during my visit almost half of the spaces are closed, so there was not a lot to see. They were having photography exhibition by that time and I'm more interested in painting and sculptures so I was a bit disappointed. But it was still a nice place to go if you do not have much to do and want to relax in the afternoon/to visit on rainy days. I wish there will be more spaces opened next time I visit. Also, there are a lot of galleries near the MMCA, so it can be a good idea to visit the galleries around the area.", May 2016
44,5.0,Very Fruitful Visit,"Must visit if you are an art or cultural lover. MMCA is a modern architecture with innovative interior design, which was awarded as ""Architects of the Year"" in Korea, 2014. Also, it is an art, culture & education multi-function complex, consisting of 8 galleries, lecture halls, digital facilities and theater. A wide range of exhibitions have exceeded our expectation, which provided a new art appreciation experience.  You can also enjoy free admission to visit during night opening from 6pm-9pm on Wed/ Sat. Don't miss it!", May 2016
45,3.0,So-so,"The museum building is spacious and fancy, located just outside Gyeongbokgung palace and the folk museum. However, at the time of my visit, only one or two (!) of the eight exhibition galleries were open, so not that much to look at really. Make sure to check in advance before you visit, since it not cleary stated on their website front page which exhibitions that are open. Closed on Mondays and entrance fee for adults is 4000 won.", April 2016
46,5.0,Loved this place!,"Really awesome, affordable museum to wander about. Many different exhibits and installations happening ~ I really enjoyed the William Kentridge exhibit. The museum itself is very modern and open. We went on a holiday when the museum admission was free for everyone. Even though there were A LOT of people there, it did not feel crowded because of the very large, open spaces.", February 2016
47,5.0,Amazing Place!,Didn't even notice when ladies said it's time to close the museum! Spent there whole day without noticing when is it time to eat.  Enjoyed the benefit of free admission for students but had so much fun!, January 2016
48,5.0,Not so well known as it ought to be ...,... possibly because it is very new. The MMCA houses innovative and participative exhibits with some multi-media work too. The best of modern art from Korean and foreign artists., November 2015

57,5.0,Beautiful space and wonderful exhibition!,"Amazing space and architecture,World class  local and international exhibitions and curatorial. There were 5 exhibitions on at the same time. Best of all, entry is free on Wednesdays(??time) and Saturdays ( 6-9pm)I find it fascinating that Koreans are really into Art and visitation is a for Everybody not only Art enthusiasts- babies, kids, teens, parents, granfolks, couples- Everyone was attentive and interested.  I've never experienced that my whole life travelling around the world.  Just a bit far to walk. :P", August 2015
58,4.0,Awesome museum,"We'd heard great things about this museum and given that it was a short walk from Gyeongbokgung Palace we decided to stop by.

62,5.0,Great museum of contemporary art,"If you like contemporary art, the sleek looking museum is a great museum. It is an impressive space that is full of large scale exhibits.

It is a nice and relaxing way to spend a day.", July 2014
63,5.0,Pandas,"The main reason why we visited here is because of the 1600 Pandas event. Good thing it was also scheduled when we were in Seoul. Since this is a one time event, the pandas won't be there anymore. Good thing we were able to catch it before it transfers to another city. As for the museum, the place is full of large art pieces.", June 2015
64,4.0,"If you like contemporary art, particularly large scale installations",, May 2015

Helpful staff, quite a lot of interpretation in English, a fair price - 7000 to see all the bits on display today, and you have a great way to spend a couple of hours.  If you like to go to places where there are more Locals than tourists, interactive exhibits and an atmosphere which suits kids and adults alike, give it a go.", January 2014
79,4.0,Very good modern art museum at a price,"This museum is way more conveniently-located than the Korean National Modern Art Museum, but the entrance costs no less than 7,000 won. I think the collection is excellent although I personally would not normally pay the ticket price to see it.

Once inside, the ease of flow between galleries and the exhibitions to see were wonderful and even better since we happened to go on the last Wednesday of the month which is the free entrance day... which we hadn't known about. ^^", November 2013
82,5.0,A nice new addition to Seoul's offerings,"We really enjoyed most of the modern art, especially the House in the House, in the House, in the House,.... Children will also enjoy several of the artworks. Of course, like in any modern art museum, you sometimes have the feeling ""so what"" and/or ""I can do that"" (not sure if that is true), but all in all we found the museum a really god one. (We also checked out the new Zarah Hadid building called Plaza but that has not opened yet).", November 2013
