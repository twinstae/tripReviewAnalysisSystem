0,4.0,Worth a visit,The park offers  360° view of Seoul and the Han. Worth noting is how the park came about. From being a landfill to becoming an attraction tells us that nothing is impossible with political will and determination., December 2019
1,4.0,See a land of Lalang during winter .,"If you do not wish to attempt 291 stairs or long hilly walk up to the top of the park, you can take the golf-cart shuttle service departing from the park entrance at a small charge (1 way 2,000 won / return 3,000 won).", December 2019
2,4.0,Wrong time but still worth it,"Of course I am here in winter so grass in brown and bot much color. However, it also meant that it was deserted and felt like I had the whole park to myself. I started from the World Cup Stadium and walked up the stairs.  There is the option of taking a car, which I did on the way down as it was after sunset and cold AF. Paid KW 2,000 for single trip As you go up, Seoul is revealed in bits, breathtaking really. As someone who comes from a place where we still have sweeping vistas of untainted Savannah, it was a bot sad to see the cramped up high rises and kinda feel the suffocation from so much concrete. I sat and watched the sunset over Han River and as sunsets go, definitely one of my best.", December 2019
3,5.0,Highly recommended!,"If u want Seoul pictures different from all your friends', then this is the place to go!  your pictures will come out looking Instagrammable too!Take to World Cup Stadium Station and then walk towards Haneul Park. u have the option to take the buggy shuttle bus up onstead of climbing the steep slope up. The bus is highly recommended and cost only KRW1000 for a round trip. The field is huge so no worries about crowd. Each one has his own little patch of muhly grass to disappear into and take pictures!", November 2019
4,5.0,Sky Park,"Haneul Park is the highest park and one of the five parks situated in World Cup Park. The park can be reached by climbing the wooden stairway or riding the parks electric tram. It was once a landfill that has been turned inti an ecological park. Once you reach the top, you can enjoy the fantastic view of Seoul and the Han river. The view is breathtaking and goodspot for taking pictures and relaxing.", May 2019
5,4.0,Dive deep into Lalang,"I went to Haneul Park in Mid Nov and flowers have withered. All that were left are field of brown Lalang. Definitely, was hoping for more colours but can't be help that I went at the wrong timing. Personally felt that the park will be enchanted if we went at the right time with flowers blooming.You will be required to climb stairs up to the park. After the short climb, the gradient is gentle. It took us around 45 minutes to finish exploring the park, taking photographs. The park is a 10 minutes walk from world cup stadium, making it accessible by public transport.The weather was cooling then at around 10-14 degree Celsius making the walk enjoyable. It was a worth a trip there as you can visit Mapo-Gu or Hongdae easily after. It will be added bonus if you plan the trip well and see the seasonal flowers in timely manner.Overall, a beautiful place to go to if you have extra time to spare and is looking for a spot for instagram worthy pictures.", November 2019
6,5.0,Beautiful and peaceful place!,"I found this place from a few blogs that recommended scenic places to visit in South Korea. It is not hard to get here. Just needed to walk quite a distance from the train station. This visit to the park is very nice if you have one whole day to spare and relax walking around to just look at the scenery. There are other parks nearby but the area is very huge and you cannot visit them all in one day. Our feets are also hurting from the long walk. I visited during the end of Autumn, nearing winter. It was worth the trip here because it is really as beautiful as described in the blogs and when I was there, there wasn't a lot of people or tourists. Only the starting area has some crowd, but when you start to walk up and explore the tall plant areas, it is very peaceful and quiet. And you can take beautiful photo there. Just remember to bring a tripod if you have no one to help you take photo! I would suggest not to step into the plant area as it will kill the plants. There are already some area that people have cleared for you to step into so you can walk around and find those areas to take your photos instead. If you do not want to hike up, there is a place near the bottom of the park to purchase a ticket for the buggy car to bring you up, One way or round trip.  The ride is very nice if you can sit at the back seats which was what we did.  If you are hungry, there is a little snack shop near the tall grass area, with many choices of food and beverages. There's also a few table and benches where you can rest and eat your snacks or instant noodles on. Just outside the train station, there are some shops selling clothes if you are not wearing enough.", December 2018
7,5.0,SKY PARK,I come to Hanuel Park on autumn day. The weather is so cool and little hot at noon.The park is near by World Cup Stadium.It's so easy to go to there by subway.And you take electric car to the top or climb to there.You should go to pinky grass hill., October 2019
8,4.0,Best experience,"It has fresh air and clear blue sky. I really enjoyed the moment there. You can go there by subway to World Cup Stadium Station and walk about 1 kilometres to Haneul Park. You can choose shuttle bus and pay about KRW 5,000 for round trip or just walk by the upstairs to the destination. It was good experience!!!", October 2019
9,4.0,"Silver Grass, Flowers etc","Its my 2nd time here, went on summer 2018 and autumn 2019.You can see the park in many photos in social media. Its a nice backdrop for photos.Its crowded when we visited, long line for the golf-cart shuttle service.", October 2019
10,4.0,Often known as Sky Park,"Visit this park for views of the river, city and football stadium. The area was a land fill turned into an attractively landscaped hill.  It is a popular destination especially when its tall grasses seed and turn red. The hill top has a cafe and toilets. The staircase serving the hill features 291 steps, so bare that in mind when you start to climb it.", October 2019
11,4.0,Worth the climb,"Instagram brought us here! The park is huge, from the size of it, probably 90% is filled with silvergrass and the rest is pink muhly grass and kochia. We arrived early in the morning and had to walk around 20 minutes from World Cup station to reach the foot of the hill. There are 3 options to reach the top, by tram, stairs or hill climb. We opted for stairs and get down by hill. There was silvergrass festival during my trip but it wasnt fully bloom yet. Pink muhly grass on the other hand was blooming perfectly but the land plot for pink muhly is too small hence huge crowd. Overall experience, we had great time here", October 2019
12,5.0,Silver & Pink Grass,"You may call it hype, marketing, commercialized space...  I call it, a patch of beautiful nature called PARKIf you have the time, GO Autumn is the best time to go when the grass turns pink and the leaves are yellow. The path is already an adventure with the different sounds that tingle your sensesThe signage around about wild creatures make you appreciate their respect for nature and the natural habitat of animalsSome say it is nice to go on foot instead of riding the buggy... I think paying 3,000 Won is better then perhaps fulfilling your step while at the top moving from one section to the other is much better.Make sure to take a drink with you because you will want to sit in one of the huts with a cold drink on hand (and maybe some snacks)-DONT FORGET THE SUNSCREEN!", October 2019
13,4.0,Nice place,Interesting at the top with the grass  land and good views of Seoul.   Noticed long lines for the shuttle to the top.   Not sure why so many waiting for shuttle.   You could walk to top in less time than in line.  And there is a gradual road to top if you want to avoid stairs., September 2019
14,4.0,Good in October,"I visited here at the end of September this year and in October of last year. I went to see the pink Muhly grass and the silver grass. It was pretty but not as full at the end of September thus I recommend going in October as I went last year - the silver grass was blooming then at that time. Overall, nice views from up there. One time we hiked up, the other time we took the trolly ride. It costs 3,000 won one way. Avoid going on the weekend, if you can, as it is packed then. Weekdays are much better.", September 2019
15,3.0,Its just another park.,"To be honest, its just another park. It will serve as a good location for wedding photoshoot but I can't think of another reason to go there and walk under the hot sun. It provides good vantage points overlooking seoul and the world cup stadium but thats about it. Not much variety of flora or fauna too.", September 2019
16,5.0,Beautiful Park,I went there summer time so the silver grass are not showing. But overall the park is beautiful and refreshing because it’s in higher location., May 2019
17,4.0,Nice field,We went mid May and the grass was knee-high. Very important to check when the grass is scheduled for cutting or else you risk missing out on the pretty backdrop.  There ware signages about FROGS so beware if you ware one like me who gets creeped out by them.  Very important to enter at the base of the hill and not anywhere else... why? because that's where you can ride the buggy up the hill instead of treading 950meters UPHILL :)  Trust me you will want to ride it ;), May 2019
18,5.0,Great scenery park,"To reach this park, we walked from World Cup Stadium Station to the base of this mountain and climb up by the stairs. After sweat a bit you will see a great tall grass field and nice view of Seoul opposite the Han river from the top of mountain. This park is good to visit before winter. We were there in the end of November and saw they started cutting the grass.", November 2018
19,4.0,Nice walk,"Nice workout to climb the stairs up, if you do not want to climb the stairs you can pay the mobile buggy to go up, not sure of the price perhaps 1000won or 2000 won per person. Is nice up there and best to go during spring or autumn . Autumn would be prefect with the bloom of the furry silver grass i am not sure of the grass name.", September 2018
20,5.0,Commending great city scenery park,"It's a place where all garbage that are collected from the city of Seoul. At that time we're using coal briquet for heating in winter. Ashes after its burn are collected and dumped here then where was an outskirt of city 40+ years ago rises to make a huge hill.It's well gardened with trees and flowers and becomes a beautiful garden hill. When in the fall, it's fully covered with reeds that is great.Many shutterbugs go there to take nice landscape photos with changing leaves.", October 2018
21,5.0,A great find,"This place is beautiful before the winter season. However, you can still get to see some tall grasses after the winter season. The shuttle is worth paying if you do not plan to hike the whole way to the top of the park.", March 2019
22,5.0,"Nice park, great views","If you are interested in relaxing on a weekend or getting in some exercise, this may be your place.  If you hike up the nearly 1000 steps to the top, you get a great view of the Han River, Yoido, Seoul, etc.  (You can also walk on the trail — more steps but less steep).   Several bike trails, jogging trails, etc.   Enjoy the flower gardens and hanging squash tunnel.", August 2018
23,4.0,Go at the right season,"It was quite a journey to get to the top but I bet the view was worth it on a perfect season. Unfortunately for us, the place was barren the time we went (March 2018 to be exact)", April 2018
24,5.0,Beautiful golden afternoon,"We burned calories and leg muscles getting to the top, but it was worth it.  The Eulalia glowing in the setting sun was spectacular.", November 2018
25,4.0,Picture-Pretty,"Oh, this was fun. Haneul Park was not on our itinerary, but since we were in the area, we decided to make a go for it and check out what was so special about it—why it was deemed one of the “most Instagram-worthy places in Seoul.” Going up, you can either hoof it or take a tram for a minimal amount. We decided to take a tram, and there was a medium-sized line, but manageable. Upon arriving at the top of the hill, we were pleasantly surprised to see the silvergrass (?) in autumn colors with some snow (this was in the mid-afternoon, almost December). It was indeed very pretty, and the sweeping view of the grass, the river and the city did explain why it’s very popular for people to go there and have their photographs taken. Never expected the grassland to be so pretty, and that the area used to be a landfill and now is a park is quite impressive too.", November 2018
26,5.0,Another beautiful scenery in the middle of metropolitan city,"Despite being a metropolitan city, Seoul has a lot place with beautiful scenery they can offer. And this one is definitely one of it. Though it can be slightly a little bit tiring since you have to climb a lot of stairs before you reach the so called Haneul Park (Literally means Sky Park). But once you reach the end of the stairs and found this little paradise on the top of the hill, then you really feel like you're in heaven. For the best time, you might want to come here during autumn~! They have the best view in autumn~!", October 2018
27,4.0,Family tour in Korea,Haneul Park is a good park to enjoy and relax only after you climbed a series of ladders going to the top.A good exercise. The park offers a good view of the surroundings especially of the stadium and has a lot of different trees and plants in contrasting colors., November 2018
28,5.0,"Quiet, peaceful, good views",Great park to get away from the buzz from Seoul city. Small provision shop with coffee and snacks is available. Best view of Seoul. Good photo opportunities. Still pretty in December., December 2018
29,5.0,Silvergrass,It is a park located near the world cup stadium. The best time to visit this place is during autumn when the silvergrass start to turn golden and silver from green. They also have kochia and pink mullberry grassYou can take the stairs to the park or take the 3000won shuttle. I recommend taking the stairs to enjoy the breathtaking view., October 2018
30,4.0,Beautiful Views from Haneul Park,"Take the metro to World Cup Station and go out from Exit 1. Then walk across to Haneul Park. Takes about 5 minutes walk only. Pay for the entrance fee of 3000 Won and add a little extra to take the shuttle to the top but for those who enjoys the walk, by all means hike up the slope.Went in December2018 and enjoyed the place without all the crowd. Had all the time to take photos, etc. The views from Haneul Park is breathtaking. But once the wind blows, hope you have enough layering to protect you. :p They only had the toilets at the Café area opened. While the rest were all closed. Café wasn't open either.", December 2018
31,4.0,Great View,"This is an awesome place for photos amongst tall plants (i have no idea what its called). My guess is it will be full of colours at Spring time. You get a great view of Seoul with mountain backdrops opposite the Han River. The sun also sets there so the view should be magnificent. On the other side, where the sun rise, more mountains are located.Getting here is kind of complicated. So i will summarise as easily as i could.Train to World Cup Stadium.Exit 1.As you exit, follow the stadium by the left, means the stadium is on your right. Walk by the pathway beside the main road.As you go round, keep your eyes on your left. You will see a hill with 'fan' or 'windmill' structure at the top of the hill. That is Haneul Park. Just find a crossing to get there.To the top, there are shuttles at the car park. Or, you can climb a zig-zag flight of steps (300 steps).Or, you can walk by the road path up.", December 2018
32,5.0,A beautiful garden in autumn ,"The park was quite big and well maintained.  It was accessible by subway; close to World Cup Stadium Station.  After a 10 mins walk from subway station, there are over a few hundreds steps to climb to the peak of the park.  There is also a shuttle to take visitors to the peak at a small fee. The garden was especially beautiful in autumn, with different types of plants of distinct colours, such as Eulalia grass, pink muhly grass etc.  Highly recommend to visit in the morning if you want to take nice pictures.", October 2018
33,4.0,Gorgeous view,A very nice park to chill and relax. You can choose to take a paid shuttle to go to the top of the hill or walk up the stairs. View from the top of the hill is breathtaking. Nice scenery around the park too., November 2018
34,5.0,Best place to visit in autumn,Visiting this place requires some stamina. The views and the experience worth the efforts. You can either climb up the stairs or walk on steep hills leading up to the park. I personally find stairs climbing much more easier.The silvergrass in autumn brings a sense of calm with a hint of sadness (maybe it was just me). Absolutely poetic if you are sentimental. Recommended to visit at least once during autumn season., November 2018
35,4.0,Nice view at Haneul park,"Just follow the sign to haneul park. There are shuttle service which cost 3,000 KRW for round trip. View is nice but nothing much to do.", November 2018
36,5.0,Haneul Park,"Just did a trip to Haneul Park yesterday , the park is very beautiful. This is best time to visit as the Eulalia is all brown in Color & not to mention the weather is perfect too. Those in Korea for holiday , this place is worth a visit !", November 2018

But on october you can see cosmos garden on the park. This year the park has pink grass and kochia garden too.  I was visited at noon. The view is amazing with the orange sky., October 2018
38,5.0,Lovely,"I love this place. One of my favorite places in Korea. You can visit with your boyfriend, girlfriend, with your family, even by yourself. You will love it. It makes me feel so fresh, comfortable, and also healthy. Haneul means ""sky"". Love that name too. Good place for a picnic, for taking memorable pictures with the ones that you love.

39,5.0,Great place,Hello guys i been to this park solo but i think it was not good discussion if you want take picture you have yo be with friend the park is amazing relaxing and clean but also don’t visit the park during the weekend, November 2018
40,5.0,"Great way to start my trip, Haneul Park!",A climb for an hour just to see its amazing view. Haneul Park is a park for the family and friends. Gives us the vibes of a park and mountain at the same time. :), October 2018

42,4.0,A popular park for local people even on weekdays,"The park is very popular among local for its silver grass festival. We went there on Monday morning and was thinking there would not be much people however we're wrong. There were many people already waiting for shuttle bus to go up to the hill. At the end we had waited for more than 30 minutes. It only took 5 minutes taking the shuttle and a round ticket is not expensive. You could also choose to climb few hundred steps instead.The view on the peak is stunning, you could take a lot beautiful photos with the endless silver grass field. Also,  if the weather is good you can also have a very nice panoramic view of the city. Beware there is nothing else on the hill, if you are not interesting in taking photos you probably will get bored very soon.", October 2018
43,4.0,Awesome garden,"We took the train from Myeongdong to get to this place and it's a little hard to find.  It's right next to Seoul World Cup statdium, however you have to walk around it to find the way going to the park.  We hiked up the hill which isn't so bad and took the tram going down.  This is a must when you are in Seoul, it's amazing view is breathtaking.  It was a dumpster back in the days and was reclaimed to commemorate the World Cup in early 2000.  A must see in Seoul!", November 2017
44,4.0,"Garden in the Sky, a sight to see","As its spelled out in the packaging, Haneul means Sky. The park/garden is located on a hill that was used as dumpster back in 1990s, the government rehabilitate it to become a park near the World Cup 2002 because the location is very near to World Cup Stadium in Jamsil. The trek above can be quiet a feat, but they also offer a buggy service for you with extra charge. You can choose to hike up and down (they also have wooden staircase if you prefer), or riding the buggy to save your knees' joints. I myself rode the buggy going up and took the stairs down (slowly, because it was quite tiring). The view on top is marvelous, in early October, the grasses are turning silver, they go about 2 meters high, great photo ops, in between the grasses. They also have some Red Kochia and also a bit of Pink Muhly grass, great place to take picture. You can enjoy the view of Seoul from top of the hill, and relax a bit before going down. Overall, it's a good destination, you can visit this park in the morning before going around your other destinations.", October 2018
45,4.0,Silver Glass session,"It silver glass session, so we decide to pay a visit here. I suggest take the tram/electric golf cart go up to the hill. Just a small price for it. But if you want to enjoy the night view, then you have to walk down as the tram last stop is 6pm. Quite a long walk from the nearest MRT station but worth it as my country don't have this.", October 2018
46,5.0,Best park in Seoul,"About 15 minutes walk from World Cup Stadium, the park was huge and located on a hill which required a hike passed 291 steps. It was so beautiful during late autumn with silver grass and cosmos. We walked to the end of the road to watch Seoul from the other side. I love this place, maybe the best park in Seoul!", October 2018
47,5.0,Very crowded on weekend,This is a huge nature park on a hill. Flame grass(silver glass) & cosmos area is very beautiful in fall. Really crowded during that time.- One part of World Cup Park that consists of several parks.- You'd better prepare foods in advance. The stadium complex is a good place to buy.- There are mini shuttle buses called as Mangkongi Bus. It's not recommended when there are many visitors. A long queue will make you exhausted waiting.- Great photo spot., October 2018
48,5.0,Land of Silver Grass,The long walk from subway station & climbing 700 meters stairs totally worth it ! When reach at the stairs from subway station (about 5 minute walk) kindly have a a few minutes break before continue the journey to climb the stairs. The views are superb on Autumn ( I visit on early Nov) & enjoy taking photos up there ! When going back if you want to have a coffee break there is cafe near stadium ( A Twosome Place), November 2017
49,5.0,I guess you should go in the Fall,"I came here in the spring of 2015 and after climbing those 200+ steps, I was so disappointed that everything was cut down and ugly. I made such a great effort to come here, after just getting over the flu the day before.  After reading reviews, apparently the best time to come is in the Fall.  I will definitely make it back here one day when it is more picturesque.  The little brick pathway with the trees on the sides was still pretty even though the fields were not.", August 2017
50,4.0,Epic history,"A long walk up the 200+ steps but great views. Did you know that this used to be the Nanji-do garbage dump for west Seoul? On a hot day, you can still smell it faintly. The methane gas is captured and used to produce the electricity for the nearby World Cup Stadium park.Great food trucks in the neighborhood in the evenings too.", May 2018
51,5.0,A Place that Everyone Visiting Seoul Should go to!,"Haneul Garden is easily one of the biggest and best outdoor attractions in Seoul. It takes about 30-40 minutes to walk to from the subway station (and the walk is uphill, although on a road, so a little fitness is required). However, the view and gardens themselves are well worth the walk. Any season, Haneul will be amazing. Further, every side of the garden offers a new and unique view of Seoul.", September 2017
52,4.0,A great park to go to during Autumn,Haneul Sky Park  (하늘공원)  is the most popular park situated in the World Cup Park and is best to go to during Autumn where Eulalia ( Miscanthus sinensis) blooms. It’s a very nice place to get those Instagram worthy picture, October 2017

63,4.0,Haneul Park; Sky park,"I visited Haneul park on Korea  Chuseok day.  Haneul means sky in Korean, so it can be called as Sky Park too. It is a big and beautiful park, and surround by Noeul park and Hangang park as well. I wanted to visit Haneul Park since long time ago because it is a very nice place to take photo. I purposely visited on Chuseok day, as i expected there would be not much of people visiting on this day. But when I reach the destination, I was surprised because there were so many people. A lot of people bring their pets along and many families are enjoying their time. The way to reach the park, you have climb a zigzag stairway which called sky stairs. It consists 291 stairs! If you do not want to climb the stairs you may take a ride too! I  went up by myself and it took some time and energy because of the crowd. When I reach the park, it was really nice and flowers are all around. But it was quite bad because the sky got darken so quickly so I was unable to take lots of nice photo. Get there early if you want to take photos, but if you  like to enjoy sunset or night view then it is good to visit on evening too ^^. There will be having a festival here every October so you can visit Haneul park for this festival. Furthermore this is a good place to visit in autumn too~", October 2017

69,5.0,Beautiful place to visit during autumn,Very beautiful place for engagement shoots and pictorials.It is walking distance from the world cup stadium but you have to take a small car to take you there ( from the ticket booth) as it is located uphill., November 2016
70,5.0,Must visit park in Seoul!,It's gonna be your leg day! But it worth every steps you take to reach the top. This park gives 360 degree views of Seoul. Plus the eulalia field.. it was just breathtaking!, November 2016
71,4.0,Great way to take in the view and get some excercise,"At the recommendation of JW Marriott Executive Lounge staff, we decided to try this gem. I was pleasantly surprised at the beauty, ease of hiking, and facilities within the park. The view was simply amazing! We took the stairs up and walked down the path. I would recommend that you walk the path that's lined by trees/forest on both sides. It was a beautiful path. At the top of the Foothill (after working up 260+ steps), you walk up few more steps, and you're presented with beautiful prairie and various walking paths as well as the observation deck. This is great place to visit, and it's free!!!!", November 2016
72,4.0,"Lovely views, flowers and foliage in the fall.","We spent a few hours walking in this lovely urban setting. Even in the third week of October, the cosmos were in full bloom and the eulalia grasses looked great. However, on this specific Saturday it was crowded and noisy, so maybe a weekday would be more relaxed. Be ready for a lot of stair climbing and paths with moderately steep inclines. Great panoramic view over the city.", October 2016
73,5.0,Must go!,"I was here in Oct and coincide with their silver grass festival. I must say KTO really do an excellent job promoting.I understand usually the park is closed in the evening, but during this festival, they remained open. Nearest subway station is World Cup Stadium station. Signage are clear during this festival ( all in Koreans though)  and I'm not sure if there'll be enough signs during normal day.I was following taking a chance and following he crowd 😂Good for a walk after dinner or couple dating. Heels are not advisable. It's a slope uphill. But definitely worth it. Check the weather if you are going as it may get chilly uphill.", October 2016
74,5.0,Breathtaking ,"This park was beautiful. A true hidden treasure is the heart of Seoul. First you have about a 15 to 25 minute walk to the top of the hill. There is a place to by drinks and snacks at the top. Once you arrive you will soon see endless fields of flowers, tall grasses, light tunnels and a large bowl structure that you can climb inside of. It's essentially a large maze that's perfect for taking photos. You can also see some great views of Seoul. You can easily see Namsan Tower and the nearby World Cup Stadium. I highly recommend this park!", October 2016
75,5.0,So close yet so far from the city,"In the middle of 2002's World cup village, this park built on a landfill is just an incredible place to spend the afternoon, walking around the fields, with an incredible view of the city. It's even better in Autumn when all the fields turn to a yellow color.", March 2016
76,4.0,Quaint ,I love this place. Quaint and away from the hustle bustle of the city. Not to mention the view from the top is amazing - you can see the river and the World Cup stadium too., August 2016
77,4.0,Nice walk after dinner,"This park near the World Cup stadium (part of World Cup park, between Noeul park and Pyeonghua Park ) in mapo-gu is easy to get to.  Signage gives clear direction and the stairway to the top of Haneul Park was well maintained.  There was information at the bottom of the stairs saying there are 291 steps to the top and the amount of calories that will be consumed for the climb.  Along the stairway, the park very considerately shows the count of steps from 291 so as you go, you know how far you are from the top.  It was almost 8 when we arrived.  Regret not bringing a proper camera to shoot the beautiful Hangang with lights on in building on both sides and the many bridges crossing it.", May 2016
78,5.0,A beautiful park with amazing view ,"It's near world cup stadium and easy to get too. I like the park and the view there, and easily it can be considered one of the best parks in Seoul. Walk around there and enjoy the beautiful nature with a smile", December 2015
79,3.0,I visited at the wrong time,"If you make the trip all the way out to Sky Park (Haneul=sky) go when the grass is tall, so I suppose in the summer or autumn. I went when the grass was cut and the park was bare. Interesting fact: the sky park is a covered up pile of garbage.", March 2015
80,4.0,Great to visit,"It is quite easy to get here since there are some electric shuttle cars to take us to the park.There are many interesting attractions to take some photos.Suitable for camping, and any generations.", October 2015
81,5.0,Nice park near World Cup Stadium,It's worth to visit this place. Beautiful scenery. You can go up by walking along the stairs up to the hill or take the Eco-Tram there., October 2015
82,5.0,Don't miss! If you travel in seoul,"The most beautiful park in seoul! On the top of the park, you will see Han river and grass.How to go : World cup stadium station (brown line) exit.1, Go straight until you see traffic light in the left hand side and then cross the street. Turn right and keep straight. you will see blue bridge in front of you. It's entrance to the park.", December 2015
83,4.0,Path to heaven is not easy,"The stairs to the top are a good workout, slightly tough but the view at the top is totally worth it. Beautiful in autumn. Lots of small flies around but they won't bother you.Also a great educational trip to see how the Seoul government has changed something completely unattractive (smelly landfill) into an attraction for locals and foreigners alike.", November 2015
84,4.0,Autumn is the best season for visiting here,We visited here in the Autumn and it was the most beautiful time of this park.  The long grassland is stunning, October 2015
85,5.0,Magnificent Autumn View,"Hanuel Park is one of the five parks located at World Cup Stadium Park. The park was a landfill which the Seoul government turned it into an ecological park.  There are different ways to get up to the top.  You may either climb the 290 steps, hiking or take the buggy for KW5000 per person (2-way trip).   The highlights during the Fall season at Haneul Park or aka Sky Park are the enormous Eulalia grass aka silver grass across the park.  Its shimmering golden background & sunset is certainly the best spots for beautiful photo shoots especially wedding photo shoot.", October 2015
86,4.0,Amazing View,"The long walk up the park was not my favorite part, but I can say that it was worth it. I really loved that you can see the Han River and the city from the park. It was autumn when I was there and walking around was really a joy because it was not hot. The park was also big enough, so even if there were a lot of people, there is space for everyone. If not walking up to the park and walking down is not your thing, I think there is a shuttle that can bring you to the park but for a fee.", November 2014
