0,1.0,Really disappointing,"This is a few metro stops from the center of Old Seoul. Not difficult to get to on line 1 but not worth the trouble. The place is quite large but the goods are mostly of no interest, or just stuff like clothes and shoes sold in so many other places as well.", January 2020
1,3.0,Interesting but not really worth the walk from DDP,"I love a flea market, especially when in a fascinating country, but this was a bit disappointing. Lots of items far too big for hand luggage and lots of tat but little I was taken by. I particularly look for vintage clothes and fabrics and Olympic memorabilia but that was all a bit thin on the ground unfortunately.", September 2019
2,4.0,Nice Market,, October 2019
3,4.0,Interesting to see things from decades ago,, June 2019
4,3.0,Worth a stroll,, June 2019
5,5.0,Great Shopping,A real hidden gem.  Our driver suggested this place and we were not disappointed.  Some really top quality items at bargain prices enabled us to wipe out our shopping needs in one stop., May 2019
6,3.0,Interesting & fun flea market,, July 2018
7,5.0,Is exactly what it says it is - a flea market.,"We came with no presumptions other than the fact it was called a flea market, so we didn't expect to see anything in particular. We were both very pleasantly surprised to see so many film cameras from the early 1900s to mostly 1960-1980 era cameras. We marvelled at the variety of them and their charm. Definitely a must visit for any camera enthusiasts. Other than the cameras there is plenty of other old school electronics to be seen and military clothing as well as other used clothing, there is a cool Whiskey/Brandy stall too where we bought some very nice Japanese whiskey to have on a special occasion   Food court looked great too.", September 2018
8,1.0,Don't bother!,"I went here expecting a real craft experience, there was only one crafts stall. The rest was a glorified garage sale with everything was a real muddle. Only highlight was a delicious pancake at the upstairs food court. Needs better sorting and more crafts like it advertises. Disappointing place, could be so much better!", August 2018
9,3.0,Good people watching ,"Such a contrast to the shopping malls of Seoul.  Mostly vintage, aka used, clothes.  Some street food, nothing too tasty (I love street food).  Most of the stuff is of low quality and cheap.  It’s still worth a walk through.", August 2018
10,2.0,Vintage and army stuffs,"If you’re vintage collector or keen on buying army stuffs, this is definetely a must to go place. Most sellers not really good in english so make sure you sharpen up your hanguk tongue to get cheap price. Some people may see this as junk. Well, one man’s trash is another man’s treasure. Just walkinh distance from dongdaemon.", October 2017
11,2.0,Not that special,, October 2017
12,5.0,A great day out picking!,"Huge selection of stalls and shops with everything vintage, plus tools, clothing, shoes as well. Wander the streets, many little cafes and restaurants to take a break from shopping. Friendly people always try to help with limited english.", December 2016
13,2.0,Not worth the visit,I was there at eleven o'clock in the morning and most of the shops were not opened yet. There was an unpleasant smell in the market., February 2017
14,4.0,Antiques and secondhand.,, February 2017
15,2.0,Disappointment - Just a common flea market,"Although the name is Seoul Folk Flea market, it doesn't really showcase anything Seoul or Korea. It is just a flea market selling old goods. Might be of some interest to some locals interested in antique or used items. It is not as good as the posters and banners depict as seen in the subway stations . It is easy to go as there are signs and banners showing you the direction to this market. A food court is available but many stores are closed due to lack of business.Definitely nota place for the common foreign tourists.", August 2016
16,5.0,A very neat way to experience the locals,"I am a collectible-aholic and found this place amazing!  The area is huge and you can get just about anything you want, from antiques to junktiques to collectible to second hand goods to used/new stuff, electronics, etc.  There is one main area that is in a building that has lots of ""good stuff"" but then just about every street leading to the building for many blocks around, has all kind of street vendors, locals, families selling ""stuff"" that you would never find anywhere else, easily anyways.  There are restaurants and ""main street"" shops all around.  It was very easy to get to by the subway and then you had to know where to go after getting out of the subway but I also noticed that there were signs directing to the feel market.  Pretty easy to get to and well worth the trip so that you could barter with the locals.  This concept is pretty new to them so it was great to experience it; better than the ""commercialized"" markets, which are neat in their own right, but this is just ""different"".", September 2015
17,4.0,Great place to visit on a weekend!,"The alleyways, full of professional yard/garage-salers, are great.  The prices are a bit high, but you never know what you will find.  I recommend going one weekend, just to orient yourself with all the shops in the building and in the alleys.  Then, when you have an idea of where you want to shop, go on a 2d or 3d weekend, and do some in-depth shopping and bargaining.  Beware, there is some artwork that can some nudity if you have young children (it is avoidable if you are wary).  Finally, this is a great place to find some cheap Black Yak clothing.", November 2015
18,3.0,Junk,, September 2015
19,3.0,Go if you've been to Seoul many times,, July 2014
20,3.0,the slow market,"if you're expecting to see attractive market or shop like crazy in this place, you'll be disappointed, obviously. but if you want to see different side of seoul--the real everyday life of seoul, then you come to the right place!  for the shopper or those loving crowd, this place will be boring, as it's only a quite small market where people buy some everyday needs--ordinary clothes, fake-branded bags, CDs, or sex toys. there's also section that offers antiques items and army goods. i love to enjoy unordinary site when traveling and feel the everyday life in a city. so i find this place is quite interessing. too bad i travelled alone and i don't speak Korean even a word--so i couldn't talk to the people,which is the most interesting part in traveling. if you have spare time in seoul, you can consider to visit this place.", November 2013
21,4.0,"A must, If you´re a real picker!",, November 2012
22,3.0,Nothing for tourists,, November 2012
23,1.0,Almost a total waste of time,"I was led to believe that this was the place to come if you want vintage junk bordering on antiques.  There was very little of that here.  The entire second floor consited of rows of booths all selling the same things.  hair products in one row, bootleg cd's in another, sex toys in one, and a whole lot of garden tools.  Downstairs, there was some used clothing and one row of older items.  There were also people selling thigns outside, none of which were particularly interesting.  I LOVE flea markets, but this was quite easily the worst one I have seen in the whole world thus far.", April 2011
