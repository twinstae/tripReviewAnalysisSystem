0,4.0,"Nice, Quiet place with great views of Namsan","I went in winter near the end of the day, maybe 3 or 4 pm and it was super quiet and peaceful. They had a special event with some beautiful cloth hanging up, and some other winter games. It was quite fun and a nice place to start the hike to Namsan Tower", December 2019
1,5.0,Appreciate various building structure of korean community,Definitely well worth a visit. Affordable entrance fees and there is a schedule for english guide tour. Spent 2 hours there and easily accessible on foot from nearest subway., February 2019
2,4.0,Walk and fresh air ,"It is early winter and the air is fresh and cold. We walked from our hotel upThe track and down to this village. I can imagine how beautiful it will be when in spring. But many local still walk here, business Executives that walked after their finished their lunch. Senior folks that that stroll and the in full sports gear. Nice place to visit.", December 2019
3,5.0,One of the most romantic fall attractions and panoramic view in Seoul,"If you want a good view of North Seoul Tower and its surrounding Namsan Mountains plus a beautiful garden right at the heart of Seoul then look no further than booking your nearest hotel in Namsangol Hanok Village which is near the Exit 4 and 7 of Chungmuro Station. By exit 4 turn left then right and you would see the entrance gate to this park. It was an accident that we didn't know the hotel we booked (Oriens - separate review) is nearby. Just 10 mins walk and whola were at the entrance. It is free for public and before the park there are many cafes', food carts and restaurants around it. Built in 1998 on the north side of Namsan Tower, the village has 5 restored Korean houses, gardens, pavilion, small streams, activity center, museum and small popup stores. Hanok means restored and its location is the original site for Jeonghakdong, a summer resort during the Joseon dynasty. The exhibit hall displays their traditional kitchen, clay pots, utensils, tea rooms, etc... There are toilets and this place is accessible by PWD. If you walk further south there is a hiking trail leading to N Seoul Tower and shuttle bus that can take you there directly. Parking is also available. When we visited there was a playground and activities set for the families and their kids. It was indeed a delightful surprise and experience for us to visit this park just right beside our hotel - one of the most scenic, romantic and beautiful attraction in Seoul. A quiet calming stroll here will take you breath away with its wonderful view and amazing attractions. Do come visit it guaranteed!!!", November 2019
4,3.0,Small and Free,"My visit here occurred on my third time in Seoul and I did not regret missing it on my first two trips. Unlike other recreated villages I have gone to worldwide, this one offers only five traditional houses, which have been moved here. They provide a good cross-section of how Joseon Dynasty citizens lived, but none beckoned to linger; and no hands-on activities, such as wearing traditional garments, were available on an early weekday afternoon in November. Though there is no admission charge, the free access did not seem to stimulate interest, at least at this time of year. I saw only a handful of other visitors during my brief exploration. But this atmosphere proved to be a nice change from the crowds at popular tourist attractions, such as palaces. I enjoyed sitting by the pond here for a while and walking along one of the trails in the park at the rear of the complex.The village is near the Myeongdong area of Seoul. By subway, take Line 3 or 4, get off at Chungmuro Station and take Exit 3 or 4.", November 2018
5,5.0,Beautiful and Educational,This is a great place to spend the afternoon exploring and seeing the traditional style of living and shops. Really loved it here and It's free and easy to walk around., September 2019
6,5.0,Birthday trip,"I loved this tour. The steep inclines and quaint houses and shops is reminiscent of our tour in Tuscany (on much smaller scale). So picturesque, I can understand the attraction for tourists. But I sympathize with the residents having to put up with us taking selfies in their doorways. We only stayed for about 30 minutes. It’s a real look into the history of South Korea.", September 2019
7,5.0,Very nice,This Hanok village is easy to find and is walking distance from my hotel. The heritage houses are well maintained and is good to visit inspite of being free access, April 2019
8,5.0,A peek at Joseon culture and traditional houses,I didn't have high expectations as I went to Bukchon Hanok Village before; so reckon it'll be similar ie cafes housed in traditional houses etc. But at Namsangol Hanok Village (NHV) surprises me at every turn. First you can experience 1 hour sleeping time in the hanok (for a small fee). I thought that's a very refreshing experience in true sense of the word. Next you can rent traditional costume and take photos or pretend you're in a period drama and walk around the village. We also came across a gentleman who is a falconer and told us many information on this ancient heritage of korean falconry. The cafe nestled in the middle of the village is also very quaint and the souvenirs are worth looking at., July 2019
9,5.0,Excellent ,"We visited yesterday, 20/07/19, a family of 6 aged between 6 - 69. No entrance fee that we noticed. Information hut was on your immediate right after entry. Lovely clean toilets all the way round the area.  This trip was throughly enjoyed by all. It was a nice steady walk around the village and gardens. Fun games for the children to take part in as you walk, including a stamp collecting map for the children to find stamps as they walk around. Lovely village and So clean and well taken care of.  Some very large Koi fish in the lake which the children enjoyed watching. We could have hired traditional dress at the entrance but with the humid heat we would have struggled. I would happily go again for a lovely peaceful stroll.", July 2019

11,5.0,Great way to experience Korean culture ,"This place is a hidden jewel if you experience some of the traditional Korean culture. The park itself is peaceful and very walkable. One must try “Experience Korea” items at a nominal fee such as making  bow and arrows, making crafts, making game pieces, rice cakes, etc. The instructors are people who are experts at these Korean traditions and passionate about sharing them.", June 2019
12,4.0,Nice Village,Just take a short walk from Chungmuro station and you will reach this village. Admission is free. We walked around the few traditional houses and the pond nearby. It is small but peaceful and not crowded. A great place for a stroll and photos., May 2019

14,2.0,Nothing interested us,"We stayed in Tmark hotel which was just opposite this village and we thought we could just come over to see what it has to offer.  But found that the old buildings were converted to teahouse, shop, etc and the place is connected to a big park.  Did not explore further as we had time constraint.", May 2019
15,4.0,Good if you plan on partaking in any activities ,"The village is very pretty but pretty small. We were nearby and decided to take a stroll inside but did not book any of the activities offered (archery making, tea ceremony, costume rentals, etc). We visited on a Friday morning and it was quiet and empty. Ended up sitting by the pond for an hour and enjoying the nice day and atmosphere.", May 2019
16,4.0,Great for free attraction,"Hanok cluster, folk game zone, pavilions, ponds, time capsule square, etc.It's a great place to spend 2~3 hours.The location is really good as well. 3 min walk from Metro #3, #4 Chungmuro Station. Near the metro station, there's a bus to N Seoul Tower, too.", March 2019
17,4.0,recreated village..nice to know traditional culture.,i was taken to this village as a tour package and found it quite interesting place to explore korean traditional culture. it is a recreated village by the government to preserve Korean traditional for the people. nice visit., March 2019
18,5.0,Hanok Village,"this is the best place to experience the people staying in hanok those era.  after viewing all the hanoks in this village, feels like staying in a hanok for my next trip just for the experience.  free entrance too.", March 2019
19,4.0,Worth a walk to see the exhibits,"After walking Namsan Park, we happened upon a pathway to take us back to our hotel which cut through the Namsangol Hanok Village area.

21,4.0,An interesting (and free) Hanok Village and park to visit,"My partner and I had spent a couple of hours around Gwangjiang Market, and decided to walk the 2+ kilometeres back to our hotel on the western edge of Myeongdong. As we are want to do, we like to make the occasional detour if we think a street, or distant object/building might hold some interest. Such was the case as we were returning to our hotel. We came across the entrance to this traditional Village and park, and ended up spending more than an hour wandering around the traditional buildings, and the large park at the rear.We were not able to get into many buildings, and the one building complex that looked interesting happened to be conducting a wedding reception on the day of our visit, which meant we were not permitted to enter anyway. On the day of our visit there were some temporary food stalls operating, and I got the impression from some signage that this park and the architected surrounds/seating etc. at the northern end that the Seoul Food Festival was to be held on this site.We enjoyed our time at this site, and provides the ability to take some really wonderful photos, of the Hanok Village buildings themselves, the large park at the rear, and the higher levels of the park provide some pleasant views of the nearby city areas as well. A relaxing and pleasant place to visit.", November 2018
22,4.0,Korean history ,Nice historic park for learning about ancient Korean lifestyles and living. Surrounding park has nice trails.  Many local weddings take place here.  Relaxing place to spend an hour or two., November 2018
23,4.0,Great place for pictures ,This village is as beautiful as the buchon. They are different but both will be worth the visit. The plus point is it’s near the subway station. The cafe located within the premise has a nice ambience. I had the ginger citron tea and it was fantastic., December 2018
24,4.0,A beautiful Park,This is a relaxing and great place to visit in the afternoon. It is easy to navigate and very clean. An audio tour is recommended to get the beautiful history and background on this lovely site., December 2018
25,4.0,"Recreated Hanok Village, FREE to explore","Namsangol is a sprawling open space, great for kids to run around freely. There's definitely less tourists here, so taking pictures is easy. Unlike Bukchon Hanok Village where you have to mind your voice volume in respect to the residents, few guests get annoyed by noise here. It's a pretty quiet park, because that's how it feels like to me.", November 2018
26,5.0,Cultural!,It's free to go in. It's huge and beautiful. It's connected to the park where you can also seethe Seoul Tower from afar. They have lots of free programs you can attend - interactive or just to watch and learn. Lots of traditional games you can play., November 2018
27,5.0,Step back in to the past ,A great way to preserve the old buildings and you can also do calligraphy classes here to very picturesque, November 2018
28,5.0,Lovely place and many activities for kids,"This place is conveniently located right in the heart of the city and worth visiting. Unlike Bukchon Hanok Village where you could only admire the houses from the outside, here you can actually get inside and walk around the houses. We were there on Sunday and there was a real traditional Korean wedding hosted so we got to observe the beautiful ceremony as well as the venue. Inside, there were few activities for kids to do too. While our daughter got dressed in Hanbok dress (10,000 won for one hour), our son enjoyed making a wooden bow and arrows. There were also craft and tae kwon do show in the afternoon. All in all, it was a very nice place to visit.", October 2018
29,5.0,Lovely Traditional Place,I found this beautiful traditional village across the street from our guesthouse in Seoul. It has 5 restored Korean traditional houses. The village is not to big but has a beautiful scenery with autumn leaves from the trees. This is as perfect as Bukchon village or Korean Folk Village if you are looking for traditional instagrammable pictures and not crowded too. Entrance is free and also has autumn festival for foreigners. We attended one last Oct 27 of this year. The village also has a path to Namsam park. This village can be found on Chungmuro Station exit 3 or 4 just look for the signages. This place is lovely!, October 2018
30,3.0,Replacement for korean folk village,"If you don't want to paid for korean folk village and still want to enjoy some Korean history village, then can have a short trip here.

31,4.0,Charming recreation of Korean village,Well done exhibits of typical Korean life from the rural past. Homes have been reconstructed. See the earthenware pots where beans are fermented. Homes and furnishings are on display. Interesting place to walk around for a bit. In the heart of Seoul so access is fairly easy. Lots of other activities on the grounds as well., October 2018
32,4.0,Historical,Went here the 2nd time with my family. There's no entrance fee as well and you can pretty roam around the whole area and take good photos. If you're more into learning the history and culture in Korea. You should go here., January 2018
33,5.0,Beautiful place,"Namsangol Hanok Village is very close to Chungmuro subway. It was Chuseok when I went and there was a taekwondo exhibition, lots of food and people walking around wearing hanbok.", September 2018
34,4.0,lovely and quiet,"i went in winter so it was very quiet there were a few people around but not many very close to Chungmuro station but i walked from myeongdong so it wasn't very far at all, there is a Hanbok rental store just outside if you want to dress up bit i was flying solo so i passed on that but he village itself was so pretty and fun to explore, i wondered around a bit and stumbeled on a huge time capsule which was quite cool", December 2017
35,4.0,Experience traditional Korean culture,"It is less crowded than Bukchon Hanok Village and the vibe is a bit different. It is also a nice place to try on the hanbok and take photos. If one cannot have time to visit the Korean Folk Village, this Hanok Village can be a substitute as it is in Myeongdong and there are some performances or activities that tourists can enjoy.", August 2018
36,4.0,Traditional houses ,"Very nice area with traditional Korean houses.  The houses are well maintained and decorated.  Nice garden yard area, which is very peaceful.  Pleasant place to walk and spend a casual afternoon", July 2018

38,4.0,Quiet Stroll Through Traditional Houses,"If you like quiet and peaceful strolls whilst enjoying a good view, the NamSanGol Hanok Village is for you. There's not much going on here besides looking at traditional Korean homes (aristocratic) but the walk and sightseeing is quite quaint and serene.But in all honesty, this place can easily be a hit or miss. I went to the Korean Folk Village a few days before I came here so I didn't enjoy this scenery much (even though it's just as beautiful here). So be sure to plan out which village scenes you attend first before going to several. One is usually enough, there's not much difference for two visits. I recommend the Korean Folk Village more.", August 2017
39,5.0,Architectural,"5 mins walk from Chungmuro subway station (exit 4). Free admission but closed on Tuesday. Namsangol Hanok display Hanok (traditional Korean house) from several wealthy family. Personally I prefer Namsangol Hanok compared to Bukchon Hanok because there are many activities in this place which opens to public, flatter walking path and we can ""peep"" the internal hanok.", July 2018
40,4.0,Quaint,"In Korean, this means ""village of traditional houses in the Namsan Valley"". It's in the Pildong neighborhood in Junggu district of Seoul. They try to be authentic to the period, which adds to the charm. We saw many people coming in traditional attire and posing for photos. Very lovely garden to walk around with plenty of benches.", August 2017
41,3.0,Good place for photos,Went in mid June close to noon time and it was a bit sunny. Temperature was still a cool 27 deg C so it was ok to walk around. The scenery is nice and is good for taking some photos but otherwise nothing very interesting., June 2018
42,4.0,Interesting walk,"If the weather is good, I'll recommend a visit to this place. The architecture is lovely and a lot of the houses have rooms decorated in traditional style, allowing you a peek into Korea's past. It's not a 'walk in and look' - you can stand outside the door and look in, craning your neck around the sometimes dark corners. But there are plenty of signs explaining what you're seeing so you don't have to be well-versed in any history beforehand (although it definitely makes the experience better).We arrived towards the end of the day when everything was being packed up. I imagine it's more lively in the late morning/early afternoon when activities take place, stalls are open outside the main gate, and people walk around in traditional dress. But if you've been slowly walking the area like us, I'd still suggest to drop by. It's a very lovely area with a nice park just next door that makes for a nice stroll. There is also a gift shop which, surprisingly, has some nice and affordable souvenirs. I am not sure if this is an attraction I would've gone out of my way to reach - which we definitely had. But if you have the time, and if you're interested in seeing what Korea looked like before, then do find a nice day and go.", May 2018
43,4.0,A hidden jewel not mentioned by most tourist attraction lists -,I have been in Seoul several times and never made it to this Traditional Garden and Hanok Village. A local Korean friend of mine discovered it with me on a nice Sunday afternoon. It is only about a ten minute walk from the Catholic Cathedral., May 2018
44,3.0,"Nice scenery, otherwise a bit boring","The weather was nice, so it was beautiful to walk around and take some pictures of the nearby garden and small river that runs through. Otherwise a bit boring, but if you pass by anyway have a look.", April 2018
45,4.0,Peaceful place for a stroll or picnic,The Hanok homes here are lovely but they are only a small part of the appeal of this village. There are some beautiful walking paths and picnic areas in the park around the Hanok. It is a great place for a stroll or picnic. I enjoyed seeing and listening to the babbling stream that winds throughout the village. It is a fabulous place for photos., April 2018
46,5.0,Peaceful,"I thought this place was perfect for taking a walk. It was very quiet and peaceful when I was there. The hanoks are fun to see, but there aren't very many of them. It's free, so it's great to check out if you're in the area.", June 2017
47,4.0,Seoul Trip,"Beautiful place rich of history, better to be with a tour guide to know all the stories behind which will make your visit more enjoyable.", April 2018
48,4.0,Experience Korean Architecture,"I walked down from N Seoul Tower and took a quick walk through before heading to my next activity. It was a cold day when I visited, but it was still beautiful. I have a hunch that it would be a little more interesting at night with lanterns and lights and Seoul Tower in the distance. I would say that if you are in the area stop by. If you are going to Bukchon Hanok Village, then I'm not sure that there is anything new here. Although there is a lovely photogenic pond, so it's not a waste of time if you want to see both.", February 2018
49,4.0,A Good Place to learn About Korean Culture,"Namsangol Hanok Village offers few things to the visitor to learn about Korean culture such as Hanbok fitting, archery making, rice cake making or tea ceremony experience by paying a bit of cash. There is no entrance fee if u just want to explore and see. The hanok setting is very nice and you can learn how the traditional Korean house back then. Fortunately if you go in Spring time, u may see a bit of Cherry Blossoms as well as the other pretty flowers. If you go deep down to the center of the park you will find Seoul's Thousand Years Time Capsule which they burried in 1994 to celebrate Seoul's 600th years anniversary which contains cultural properties. It will be open in 2394 in celebration of Seoul's 1000 years anniversary.", April 2018
50,4.0,Cool,"Visited as part of a half-day, multi-site tour. It was a quick walk around and we were able to learn a bit about traditional Korean lifestyle and villages. Be sure to duck under the little walkways between buildings because you might hit your head (don't say I didn't warn ya!)", March 2018
51,4.0,Beautiful ,Even a grey day could not influence the experience at this place. Two facts helped a lot. Paper lanterns with great figures brightened the impressions there. And there was a foto shooting for an egagement which gave life to this place :-), March 2018
52,4.0,A place to get in touch with Korean traditions ,"This village is much better than I expected! I heard from other people it was pretty much traditional houses and nothing too special, but I have to say I really liked it and would visit again. The architecture is impressive and village is quite big. You can really have a feeling of how people used to live in the ancient times in Korea. They also have a nice gift shop with beautiful and original gifts.", February 2018
53,3.0,Very nice but small,Very nice place you can see all traditional houses but unfortunately very small town you can finish it less than half hour, February 2018
54,5.0,Time Capsule in Namsangol Hanok,The village with traditional houses from different places of South Korea. There is the Time Capsule on the territory of that village. 600 hundred items from modern life are buried there in the ground so that 400 years later (when Seoul celebrates its 1000 years anniversary as the capital city) it could be opened by future generation. Amazing!, January 2018
55,5.0,Awesome Self-Guided Walking Tour,"Beautiful area to walk around, it's very scenic with the traditional houses and the background of the Seoul industrialized city! Information/tourist booths can be found scattered around with maps and suggested directions to walk around the area. It is hilly, which I personally love, but could be hard on people who have any knee/leg/feet/etc. issues. There are tea shops scattered about and other stores as well. We had tea at a fantastic tea shop along the path!", December 2017
56,3.0,Small Village Near Namdaemun,"I walk here from Namdaemun Market. This is such like small village with traditional Hanok Village. If you go to Or before go to Namdaemun, please have a visit at this area to take a photo. It will not take a long time.", December 2017
57,5.0,Best in Spring!,Enjoyed every side of it since we went there during spring. lots of flowers and cherry blossoms. there are also people and couples in hanbok who are also game to take picture with. good for family bonding too as we see lots of them having a picnic, April 2017
58,4.0,Traditional Korean House Village ,來南山谷韓屋村逛逛韓國老建築.  This is a reserved village for traditional Korean houses.  The outlook of the houses are very Chinese house like.   But the inside is more Japanese oriented (this is my be due to that Korea was once the colony of Japan).  It’s definitely a good spot to visit in Seoul., January 2017
59,4.0,Very cool attraction,"Very cool attraction - also it’s free! The houses are very well preserved, and it’s cool to walk around and see.", September 2017
60,5.0,Enjoyed the peaceful garden and traditional houses,"We visited Namsangol Hanok Village on a weekday morning in summer. Beautiful garden with lots of ponds, pavillions and of course the traditional hanok village.A big place to walk around and a good place to learn about Korean Seoul culture. Definitely should visit Seoul Millennium Time Capsule where they buried 600 items in 1994 and to be opened 400 years later. What a romantic idea!We enjoyed walking around the Hanok village where there are different styles of traditional houses.Apparently, there are some ceremony, performances and hands-on activities for the visitors throughout the week. Be sure to check out their website before you visit if you like to experience more. A perfect place to spend a peaceful day in Seoul.", August 2017
61,4.0,Full of Korean traditional house,"First you don't have to pay to visit this nice place. You can see many Korean traditional home, and there are some performance you can enjoy in the evening. You can even dancing with the performers. There are also some spot where you can try some Korean traditional game here.", November 2017
62,5.0,Better than Bukchon if you want to see Hanoks and like touching things!,"My take is this is a better bet for seeing Hanoks because Bukchon is a upperclass residential district set on a hill (people still live there, so you can't just walk in!)  In Namsangol, it is a reconstructed village (mostly of old houses that were moved there, and 1 replica), so you can walk around all you like - the other nice part is that it is near Myeongdong (Chungmuro), so easily accessible, and not hilly (unlike Bukchon!)", October 2017
63,4.0,Worth a visit,"Went during their taste of korea, that had samples of eats, drinks, and carving demos.  Pretty neat experience.  Got some goodies to try and take home.", September 2017

65,5.0,Must see,This is one place that i would highly recommend when you visit Seoul. Its like traveling back in time. Its very fascinating to see how Koreans lived during those Joseon/Shilla era and how they built the houses with those intricated designs. There's no entrance fee and you can ask for a guided tour as well free of charge. They also provide wheelchairs for seniors who cant walk too long which  was really great since im traveling with 2 senior citizens., September 2017
66,4.0,Mid autumn festival,"It was fun and crowded with Korean to celebrate the mid autumn festival. Great experience, there was shows for the whole day, stalls for younger to participate in crafts, Korean families were picnicking, and food trucks selling Korean food.  The houses were in good shapes with lots of interior details and we were able to understand how Korean lived before..my boys were learning and asking what were this, why and how. Overall it was great cultural experience to learn.", October 2017
67,2.0,Underwhelming ,Pretty empty in my opinion.  Not much going on. Just drab and unexciting.  Not really worth your time checking it out. Free entry.  Metro exit 3, October 2017
68,5.0,Great free tour,"This village is good for seeing historical Korean buildings. It offers free 40 minute tours in a range of languages (Chinese, English, Korean and Japanese).  Check before you go what days and times have your language.", October 2017
69,3.0,Well preserved traditional houses in the heart of the city,"My friends and I stopped by this place on our way down from Seoul tower. Tranquil surroundings,  but without activities or sufficient signboards in languages other than Korean, it is just a location with  traditional houses", August 2017
70,3.0,Traditional but Underwhelming,"I enjoyed getting to see the traditional architecture at Namsangol Hanok Village (남산골한옥마을). I think this place is most suited for photographers and those with a strong interest in Korean culture. As a tourist, it was a little underwhelming as it is essentially just walking around and looking at the buildings. There is an area where you can watch martial arts or drink tea but it is otherwise a sight-seeing location only. If you are doing the Seoul City Bus Tour, it's worth taking 30 minutes to stop and look at it as it is free admission.", September 2017

73,5.0,Korean Folk Village,"Architecture is beautiful, this place is clean and it is free to get in. This recreation of a traditional Korean village has free shows, plenty of refreshment stands, historic recreations and is also the home to many Korean TV shows. There is a group of student offering free tour. They will answer your question about the village.", April 2017
74,4.0,Nice place,This place  is a replica of old traditional Korean villages. The entrance area is like a park and inside there is a ticket counter and a cafeteria. One can buy tickets for hiring traditional Korean dress and having a photo shoot in it for one complete hour. Overall a good place to spend time knowing abt the old Korean era and their lifestyle., August 2017
75,4.0,Beautiful quite village in the centre of Seoul,"Beautiful, tranquil area in the midst of all the hectic of downtown Seoul. Gives a good understanding of the traditional Korean lifestyle. Try to find and catch the 1 hour Nap Experience for W2000!", September 2017
76,5.0,An awesome Stroll before Night time in Namsan Tower...,"We thought it would be just a simple historical stroll through and head to namsan in the evening and end the night in Myeongdong. Well, the place is beautiful as you take in the gorgeous surrounding , landscape, historical structure and just the vibe on the place. The small details was what interest hubby and i . Beside the pond there are batches of small strawberries growing in the flower beds, and we notice some herbs here and there too.. When you walk around you will see pine cones which the shape is something Ive never seen , some kind of berries (which i wasn't sure can be eaten or not) and just the flowers are beautiful. Take Ur time and breath in the fresh air and somehow the place exudes calmness. I like that there will be a corner for anyone to try some local traditional games. The only setback is would be awesome if there was someone to explain the game to us or maybe they should put some multi-language boards on instructions of games . Lolz..

There are some demonstration of Korean craft. Hanbok experience is also available but it's not free. What I like most is the Taekwondo performance at 1pm. There was a booth outside the village which indicates ""free tour for foreigners"". I waited there, but nobody came to give tour, what a pity.

It's not a large area to visit, but I liked that it was not crowded and it was very enjoyable walking through the area.    My sister, niece, and I rented hanbok from the rental place right outside.   It was more expensive than the rental inside the village, but the hanbok were beautiful and the husband and wife running it were very nice.   The woman even did our hair for us.

If you are using subway,  stop at chungmuro station,  exit not sure. The layout of this place is just ok for me. You can see a few hanok for a few different rank. We go there twice,  the first time to visit,  and the second time is to   try their hanbok. After surveying for a few days at a few location,  we figure out that at this hanok village,  we can wear hanbok at krw 10,000 for 1 hour. Other places range around krw 18,000 to krw 20,000. The hanbok is beautiful enough so no complaint. Just that you need to be there early,  if not - maybe you have to wait for quite some times before your can try it out. Just a reminder,  before you enter this place,  there will be a shop just outside this place that also rent hanbok. If you don't mind paying higher it is ok.

There is a courtyard in the back where you can try traditional kids games, unfortunately I could not do because the instructions were in Korean and I did not do the tour.

Get out exit 3, don't go up the slope, walk straight past the petrol kiosk, follow the sign and you're there in 3 min. Nice environment and atmosphere. They moved some actual hanok onto this site. So they are not really new replicas. We went during the lunar new year festivities period and they had a lot of traditional crafts, activities and shows. Quite fun! But too cold as it was snowing hard. Fun place for kids to run around too. There's also a park at the back to explore if your interested. A nice walk around the village and feel lost in time.

Over weekends there are expected to be renactments of traditional Korean wedding around noon, so time your visit!Because there is no guided tour of the place, you are pretty much on your own. The Hanok village museum is part of a larger park. Sometimes there are cultural performances. Overall it is a good place to get an appreciation of traditional homes.

Well, some may feel that this place is a ""me too"" replica from other Hanok Villages but we feel it has its unique offering and still worthwhile for a visit to experience different time.Other than some of the old and traditional houses and buildings (but no one is living here), what this place offered was a massive garden that is so serene and tranquil. Upon entering and after a short walk, you will see a lovely pond with lots of fishes (i.e. Koi) swimming and birds flying around in a greenery and nature environment. Walking further, you will come by a section where fruit trees and vegetables are grown.Walking further in, there is an open field where the operator placed traditional Korean games here and visitors could grab one up and play, to enjoy the past time activity. What is interesting is the place where the Time Capsule that was buried here in 1994 to mark Seoul’s 600 Year Anniversary and is scheduled to be reopened in 2394!!! On top of it was the inscribed well wishes by well known political leaders and celebrities around the world.There is also a section where the theatre and tea house is located (next to each other). Unfortunately we didn't make it on time for the performance but did dropby for some tea. It was good!It was a good visit here despite the fact that the weather was sunny and warm.

Oppressively hot and humid, not much shade nor air conditioned places to pop in to cool off. The lake was pretty. The show was good, but quite staged, set to music, lots of board breaking.  Would be a good circus act.", September 2016

Ok, the snacks were that good but it was the experience I was buying. For a small fee, we also had the chance to put on traditional Korean clothing (quite a few selection to choose from) and posed for pictures inside another building. I recommend going there early so there are fewer people. We get to experience the above activities on our own without other people in the way. Just after we finish with our traditional clothing, a few groups of people were already there waiting and ""fighting"" over their preferred clothes. Another activity I wanted to try was the brush calligraphy session but for some reasons, it wasn't available until a couple of days later. I didn't realise there are seasons to calligraphy writing...

We were served little snacks to go with our tea and we could take pictures inside the room with olden Korean decoration. There are other 'experiences' that you can take part in and they are generally not expensive.

250,4.0,A more peaceful ancient Korean Heritage,This Namsangol Hanok village have 3 blocks of ancient Korean Nobles' houses which were moved from Buchon Hanok village. All the houses are still well maintain. It is very interesting to know how the ancient time the rich nobles Korean houses structure were build to keep away heat of summer and remain warm during the winter. This Namsangol Hanok houses are different from Buchon Hanok village because there are no residents reside in . Therefore the interior are still remain the same and not modernized to reside people., September 2015

255,5.0,Loved It!!,"Traditional Korean Village, This village has five restored traditional Korean houses and a pavilion, a pond, which make it a perfect spot to take a walk.There are spots where on the ground traditional games are made. During the weekends, traditional marriages are shown at Bak Yeong Hyo's Residence. The groom and bride in traditional attire, you can quickly grab a foto with them.We loved this place!", August 2015
256,5.0,Calm park and old traditional houses.,"I visited Namsangol Hanok Village a beautiful October day when weather was great. Saw an amazing taekwondo show, walked the tranquil park. Sat in the sun and watched the nice colors of the trees preparing for fall. Not many people. Great if whether is good. I spent 2 hours here.Also strolled around the traditional houses. The had different traditional activities to try, like dress up in traditional Korean clothes. Didn't try any of that. Really nice place if you want to get away from the buzz in the big city!", October 2015
257,3.0,Save it for dead last on your trip,"The buildings are genuine but the ""village"" is an artifice.  Essentially, it is a collection of 5 wealthy families’ homes relocated to this spot and landscaped to appear to represent a natural setting.“Homes” is really a misnomer; these are the equivalent of today’s mansions.  Though not overly picturesque or photogenic, they are, when examined patiently, a good glimpse into household life during that period (including how they used fire pits under the various living quarters as radiant heat).Try to get here as soon as the place opens.  As the day progresses, it will inevitably become completely over-run by busload after busload after busload of Chinese tourists.  At no other sight will you see such a concentrated number of tourists from China.  I don’t know why but this place is apparently a very popular, “must see” sight with all the tour groups.  It amounts to a large number of people occupying a relatively small parcel of land.  At times you will find yourself very distracted.  It’s quite strange because there are no busloads of anyone from any other country.This is far from a “must see” sight.  I would save this as filler at the end of your stay in Seoul; don’t risk sacrificing any prime sight or sights on your list to go here.On Wednesdays and Saturdays there are Taekwondo exhibitions by children and young teens, which adds to the touristy, carnival-like atmosphere.  Keep in mind, the village is closed on Tuesdays; although you can walk the grounds, access to the homes is not possible.I wish they would re-name two stars ""below average"" because ""poor"" has a distinct negative connotation.  I would give it two stars but for that reason.", September 2015
258,4.0,An insight into the past,"The Hanok Village is a collection of traditional Korean houses which have been moved onto a complex and rebuilt as they had been. It gives a fascinating insight into how Korean families lived in the past.We went at a quiet time in the village, around 16.30/17.00 so there were few people around but there was no food or drink place open despite the normally long opening hours of the café!", September 2015
259,4.0,Treasure and Historical,"Treasure.....this place amused me. I thought this place will be located in a very hidden place. but I'm wrong, is located in a city, it definitely gives me a WOW feeling.  Also, is kinda impress that the building remain so well and beautiful. Overall, nice place", August 2015
260,3.0,Namsangol Hanok Village on Chuseok,"Overall good experience. There were quite a lot of people- especially families with children. Only a few food stalls mostly selling traditional rice cakes, hotteok etc.They also have a special event schedule for the day with some traditional dancing and other performances.", September 2015
261,3.0,Below expectation,"This place is small. We expected expected a bigger Hanok Village with real living people in it like in Hoi An, Vietnam. By the way, it's free and this is our first Hanok Village visit in our life.", December 2014
262,3.0,I would pick something else to visit,Suggested by our guide. It was relaxing but I think there are other attractions more interesting. We saw the old ways to make Kimchee., August 2015
263,4.0,Interesting history tour,We did a tour go during the week less visitors . Our guide was very informative with the history of hanok . The houses had been shifted there from another place . It gave you a inside view of how they slept cooked and lived life in there village years ago, August 2015
264,1.0,Not worth the time,Please ignore this place as it has nothing interesting or worthy about it .  Totally deserted and barren - went with high hopes only to crash it, September 2015
265,4.0,Walk around ,Free entry. Easy to get around. Not sure how wheelchairs manage the high step in to each area We walked to this coming down from the Seoul tower through Namsan park  and then back to exit12 beside hotel Also plenty of water toilets and outdoor exercise  equipment Hilly and many steps, September 2015
266,5.0,great place and great experience,"I came here during Korea's summer vacation week - I think. so, when I arrived, there was a 'free walking course' by teenagers - about 16 years old for them to practice English, and also a teacher assists and encourage them to speak english and also introduce how traditional houses build as smart house, i.e : heat from in-door kitchen is circulated to main house.", August 2015
267,4.0,Surprisingly good,"It is conveniently located, not far from Chungmuro station (line 4) exit 4. Free admission and you can get to experience a traditional Korean village there more leisurely than bukchon hanok village, which involves a lot of tough walking.The hanbok experience and arrow making class (fee applies) are the highlights of the visit. The hanbok there are new & beautiful and you are allowed to take photos inside a traditional Korean house, which is great in my opinion.", August 2015

270,4.0,Hidden Gem!,"I'm glad I found this little gem on the way to the train station. There was also a photo studio where you can dress up with traditional clothes, get your photo taken and even walk around around the village! It was pretty cool. Overall, I still consider this a little treasure.", April 2015
271,5.0,better than Buckchon,"I'm visit two of Hanok village at Seoul, this place better than the other one (Buckcon). But, Namsangol is like a museum, there's not a real village as at Buckcon. But, you can taking a photo better than because the buildings looks real. suggest for visiting in the morning, not to crowded and you can enjoy the garden.", May 2015
272,3.0,Nothing noteworthy,"This hanok village with its handful of traditional Korean houses was a bit boring for my tastes. The 5 houses all looked the same to me and there wasn't much information about them, apart from who they were built for and when and some architectural details. You could not go inside any of the buildings, so my visit was very short.", June 2015
273,5.0,Nice walk! What I was looking for!,Loved walking the streets in the early morning. had the place almost to myself. Some nice viewpoints up the hill! Great walk!, November 2014
274,4.0,Finding it was an accident but well worth the trip,"Me and my wife was looking around Myeongdong and just decided to walk....well we walk pretty far and then we found the village. It was great seeing how my ancestors lived many years ago. The design of the building was very nice as well. I find it hard to believe Koreans were so short back in those days. The houses were pretty small in height and my wife's head touched the bottom of a doorway, and she is 63"". If you keep walking towards the rear of the village you will stumble across the time capsule. I also played a game of tuho and out of everybody that played, I was the only one to get my dart into the small hole. You have to try it, pretty sure it would make an ""excellent"" drinking game as well lol.", August 2014
275,3.0,A peak inside a tradtional house,If you want to get the feeling of how houses were traditionally furnished this is a good place to go. You can also walk around it in traditional clothing for $5. A great place to take pictures. The houses were moved from other areas so there is a good amount of space to walk around them as opposed to bukchon. Bukchon has more houses but you can only go in the few that are stores or workshops., June 2015
276,5.0,You have to see this place,Spent a few days here on return trip to USA.  There is so much to do and see and this is a must see. An oasis in the city.  Very beautiful and easy to find with local map. We walked there from Myeongdong shopping disctrict., October 2014
277,3.0,Worth taking a look at,"Our hotel was nearby so we strolled around for few hours. You get nice pictures here and it's free, but there's not that much to do around the hanok village. Few pretty nice cafes here and there but not much more, worth going for the ""old village""- type of pictures though.", October 2014
278,5.0,A great village to visit after the Gyeongbokgung palace,It is great to combine this village with the Gyeongbokgung palace at the same day. It is easy to compare daily life of  royalty and normal citizens of Korea. It also has a time capsule to celebrate Seoul 600th anniversary., June 2015

281,4.0,A short break with nature in the city,"I have been to this place just by pure luck when we were wandering around with my mum. Sadly it was lunch time and that's why most of the workshops were on break but still it was good enough to make us happy with its nature and well designed structure. We bought many items from the gift shop inside. It is not the cheapest but definitely normal prices; if you find something you like, definitely go for it.", June 2015
282,5.0,Great place to familiarize yourself with history and culture.,"This place is a good stop if you only have a few hours in Seoul. You can see old style houses, try traditional games and activities, eat traditional food and watch cultural shows.", October 2014
283,2.0,"At base of N Seoul Tower, great for photos, not to visit.","Our next stop was the Namsangol Hanok Village. By the time we found it, it was high noon and it was too scorching hot for my liking and I admit, I was acting like a spoiled brat. The village was literally close to the N Seoul Tower which made for a great photo opportunity, but other than that I would not recommend this as a must-do when visiting Seoul. Heck, when we got there we just sat on a rock under shade for about 30 minutes pretending to soak in the serenity and beauty of the area, when in reality our foot was sore and probably blistering.", July 2014
284,4.0,"Interesting, cultural",The background was really great for photos and it was interesting to see how the Koreans lived long time ago., May 2015
285,5.0,A Quick Visit to the Past in the Heart of Seoul.,"I walked to this village from Chungmuro Station. Seeing how much of a metropolis Seoul is, places like this will bring us to the past. The traditional architecture and art of Korea can be seen here, well preserved and maintained. It's right there, just amongst the tall buildings. Visitors can go for a walk around the village, learn hangeul, play traditional games and try on hanboks. At one of the houses there, traditional hanboks can be rented at less than KRW6000.00, a great bargain compared to other places I've read/found out that charges more. The lady who was in charge of the hanbok rental was very kind. Noticing that I came there as a solo visitor, she helped me took my photos like it was a photoshoot almost everywhere in the house :D The signage there had English translations. The village is a huge area, I wish I I had spent more time there. There's free public wifi in some areas in the village.", May 2015
286,4.0,"Very cute, great landscapes in the background","The Namsangol village is a reconstitution of what a traditional Korean village was during the Joseon dinasty. As a reconstitution it feels a bit like a tourist attraction (it certainly is), rather than an actual historically relevant and authentic place. Nethertheless, the village is very interesting. It is free, big enough to stroll around for 2 hours or so, and allows visitor to discover the different buildings and rooms comprised in a Korean home and village. The place is very-well maintained, and doesn't feel dated at all. What's also great about the village isn't the village itself but the background and the surrounding environment. Located at the foot of Namsan mountain, the village is allows for stunning views of the mountain as well as the Jongro skyline. In and around the village, the park is also very relaxing: patches of grass, river streams, trees, pagodas, pools, combined with the actual village, make the place truly worth seeing. Lying around for 30 minutes or so in the park is actually probably the best thing you could do in the park, as it is truly relaxing.", December 2014
287,5.0,"Good place to take pictures, and it was free","It's free, what else could I say? The place was not too big, but you can see Namsan tower clearly from there. There are few old houses, and good place to take pictures, especially for couples.", April 2015
288,4.0,well presented traditional houses from the past,"Within a short walk from Chungmuro Subway (exit 3 or 4) this ""village"" is well worth a visit. Various traditional style houses are displayed in a well planned park with some water flows nicely landscaped. Good place to stroll around leisurely, taking in some historical background of Korean life. There are periodic guided tours in different languages. According to the brochure I picked up the park is closed every Tuesday and if Tuesday happens to be a holiday, next day too. Other days the park opens by 9am and closes at 9pm (8pm during winter months). One can easily spend anything from 2 to 4 hours depending how much you want to take in. There is also a Korean traditional medicine clinic within the park where you are invited for a cup of Korean tea and a free health check. In approximately 30 minutes or so young ladies/men, dressed in traditional and colourful costume, will take some information about your physical health, take some readings (with the help of modern aids) and take you to the traditional doctor for a quick review. The doctor will explain what is best for your health and leave you, if required, with a small dose of traditional medicine for the next two days. Everything is free and there is no hidden agenda. Well done! Korea.", May 2015

291,5.0,Traditional village,"This is a traditional korean village created in the middle of Seoul's skyscrapers.  Admission is free.  You get the sense of how a typical family (nobleman, craftsman,...) lived in these compounds as they are furnished and maintained in excellent condition.  In addition, they offer demonstrations of traditional arts (basket weaving, calligraphy, trying traditional dress, martial arts).  It's also very calm and peaceful with many trees and areas to sit.
