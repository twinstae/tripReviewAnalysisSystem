0,4.0,Kdrama shooting location,"This is a small museum mansion. Built in 1913 by a pro-Japanese business tycoon, later bought by several people and in the end bought by Baek In Jae-an activist. The mansion has tatami room. Worth a visit.", October 2019
1,4.0,Small but great house museum to visit,, October 2019
2,3.0,only took about 15 minutes,All the rooms were blocked off so you can only look in through the windows.  It was nice to see what the traditional house looked like with all the furniture.  We were there less than 15 minutes.  Good thing it was free because I would not pay money for this place., August 2019
3,5.0,Amazing Hanok Museum,"One of the best Hanok experiences in Seoul for me. You can visit the inside of the yard and the house, the old house architecture with wooden doors and awnings make the pictures taken very beautiful. You can visit for free, the museum area is quite hidden so the number of visitors is not much, so you can freely travel inside comfortably.", June 2019

9,5.0,A nice historical house ,Well worth a visit if you are in the bukchon area.  This house museum is free and gives you a look into how life was like for the Korean elite in the past. This is a real house that has been converted to a museum. It is in the middle of other old historical houses that people still live in.  A very worthwhile visit., August 2017

13,4.0,Cozy + Short Historical Walk,"Baek In-Je House Museum is a wonderful place for visitors who are on their track to find Bukchon 8 Spots because it is located in the same area (Bukchon Hanok Village). Although the house was not really huge, the house is full of surprised because you'll get to see how people used to live in a traditional Korean house FOR FREE!! If you are really interested in this place, remember to bring a map or else you might get lost between those houses! The only bad thing of this place is that it is not disable friendly!", June 2016
