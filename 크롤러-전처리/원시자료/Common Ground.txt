0,5.0,Such a cool vibe!!!,The vibe of this place is just plain old cool.. the restaurants on the top floor are awesome and the shops are neat (But some are very pricey) - I saw a Dj booth in the main complex so I imagine there's some sort of a nightlife vibe here as well!, October 2019
1,4.0,Neat shopping inside shopping containers ,"If you have never seen how cool retailers can make boring shipping containers interesting, then you need to come and check this out. In one section they even had a DJ spinning tunes while you shopped!  Thereâ€™s food and seating too to enjoy your time here.", November 2019
2,4.0,Go for the architecture,"Shopping center constructed completely with shipping containers. Well done, with great visual on the outside and inside. The shopping itself is mostly streetwear oriented, and a live DJ keeps things hopping. Good people watching spot.", November 2019
3,4.0,Unique place and good for photo taking,"Common Ground or Uncommon? Its truly uncommon to me. Using stacked containers to build up the structure for a shopping place is very unique, you can imagine you are walking around a sea port. I was there on a Sunday and it was rather quiet, but good for nice photo shoot without much distraction. Nothing much to shop for me so we only spent around 30 mins to walk around. Its very near to the train station, like 3 mins walk away so can be a drop by place when you are in Korea!", November 2019
4,4.0,Novel and worth a visit,"An interesting take on a stack of shipping containers. Refurbished with stairs and elevators....as good as any small shopping mall but with a difference, good food options too.", October 2019
