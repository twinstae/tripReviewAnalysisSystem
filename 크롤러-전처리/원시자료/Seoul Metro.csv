1,5.0,Most efficient in the world!,Best metro system: 1) Inexpensive 2) Superb time keeping 3) Clean 4) Well behaved co-commuters 5) Everything is described in English (smaller fonts -nevertheless) , February 2020
2,4.0,Convenient way to travel around Seoul,Looks complicated at first especially when we need to change a few lines to get to our station but using the naver map makes it easier for us to check train timings and the best way to get to our destination. Train cabin is usually clean and comfortable. Not all exit has a lift/escalator or sometimes there are stairs leading to the platform so you may need to carry your luggage up and down the steps., January 2020
3,5.0,I use this every week.,"If this isn't the best metro in the world, then I don't know what is. Convenient, clean and consistently on time. A great way to get around Seoul.", March 2020
4,5.0,Metro ,"One of the best thing that you should try to experience in Korea, inside the train is very clean and also it run so fast. Its very accessible to everyone.  Huge and spacious inside the train. So if your in hurry or to avoid traffic this one is the best for you.", April 2019
5,5.0,THIS IS THE WAY TO GET AROUND SEOUL,"When visiting Seoul in January this year, my wife and I found that the Seoul Metro is the ideal way to get around Seoul. Just go to the underground and purchase a Transportation Card and then just top it up when needed. Getting from point to point is easy by reading the subway maps which can be paper or on the walls of the subway. We used it every day and had no problems. Highly recommend.", January 2020
6,5.0,Perhaps the best subway system in the world,"Don't hesitate to use the Seoul subways. They are clean, well-lit, and safe at any hour. Unlike Tokyo with its multiple competing transportation lines that don't appear on all maps, Seoul's subway system is integrated and maps are designed so that it is easy to figure out the route.  All signage and announcements are in English and Korean, and lines are color coded and stops are both numbered and named. If you get lost, just ask anyone for help. Almost everyone speaks English  and will be happy to help you navigate the system. There are a few negatives - it gets crowded at rush hour, especially on the green circle line around Gangnam station, and most entrances and exits are via long staircases with limited elevator access and not enough escalators for those who want to ride upstairs. Aside from that, it's smooth sailing. Almost forgot -  it's very affordable, costing less than $2  for a one way ride, and less than $5 to connect to the Incheon line to get to Incheon international airport.  I have traveled extensively throughout the world and have never found a subway system that could manage such a high volume of passengers so cheaply, safely, and efficiently. Thank you, Seoul!", July 2019
7,3.0,difficult to use the metro due to language barrier,"very bad signage, not much English we ended up using the taxi as it was not easy to use the metro in Seoul", December 2019
8,3.0,Confusing for foreigners,"Taking the train around Seoul is quite an eye opening experience. Unlike Japan, everything inside the different stations are written in Korean and translating to where you as a foreigner wants to go to is such a major headache...even with Google maps. Wished they had an app that could translate their Korean written maps into English or other languages, so as to make it faster to get to where you need to go....all in all korail works great for those that can get through the translation fast enough ...", February 2020

17,5.0,One of the best Subways in the World,"The Subway in Korea at first glance can be overwhelming. But once you find the right way of using it, it becomes a cheap and fast way of getting around Seoul. The trains are very frequent, om time and extremely clean, like everything else in this fantastic city. As long as you know which exit to use, that's the main thing that can be tricky because every underground station also has a multitude of shops. I suggest using the  KakaoMetro App, along with a good map and some good old common sense.", January 2020
18,5.0,Best metro service ever!,After riding all the big metros around the world i feel Seoul metro is one of the best..kakao metro app helped tho and all the climbing in and out is there but its relativley easier and best mode of transport..esp in winter!, December 2019
19,4.0,almost legendary,"some people call it the greatest subway system in the world, & they would be right if it could compete 24/7 with the new york metro, but it doesn't even come close to other ones such as singapore, taiwan (probably better than japan's because it's fractioned into multiple companies, at least in tokyo), but not sure if it's due to corruption or otherwise, my pet peeve, at least, for the seoul metro is the insistence of partially doing escalators to go down/up. many times you'd find an escalator at the very mouth, then halfway to the bottom, it turns into regular stairs. the worst is when you have to go on the opposite way up..", August 2019
20,5.0,The best metro I ever seen,"Very clean, with good road descriptions. Announcement in 4 different languages including English. You will never lost your way", February 2020
21,5.0,"Efficient, cheap and reliable.","Being the lazy Englishman that I am, it took a while for me to suss out Korean place names and directions of trains, but I soon came to appreciate how efficient the metro was. It was easy to buy tickets from the machines as everything was translated to English at the press of a button! On the  occasions that I was confused, there was always someone to assist when I required help.", February 2020
22,5.0,Seoul Metro is the Best Way to Get Around,"The Seoul Metro is clean, inexpensive, and convenient. The traffic can be horrendous in Seoul, so the Seoul Metro can save you time. Locals are pretty quiet when riding. The only negative thing, it can be very crowded during rush hour times. If you travel during rush hour, expect a packed train. All other times, the train was comfortable.", June 2019
23,5.0,Convenient,Excellent way to travel. The metro out here is so reliable and cheap. Using the Kakao Metro app made it so easy to navigate Seoul. I went to Mall/Aquarium and the War Museum using the metro. This paired with the Navar App and you will almost always be able to get around without getting lost., December 2019
24,3.0,Disappointing - The Non-English Speaking International Service.,"I have to say that infrastructure wise and for what I was able to see South Koreans got themselves a nice Metro system. Good reactive machines and the prices are not too expensive either. For 2 people and for very long journeys including sometimes 1 change and 9 stations per change we paid collectively some 4.200 KW.  For regular trips from outta town to the downtown Seoul, we spent collectively 2 persons 3.700 KW per trip. Not bad considering the efficacy of the system.The only thing you need to understand is that Koreans as a whole DO NOT Speak English whatsoever. I do not understand why. Every time (and there were several times) we stopped regular people in English they avoided us deliberately. And some of those times we were confused, in a pickle you may say as the system is confusing at the beginning until you get a grip.Do not even get me started with the Staff at the Metro Stations, most of them do not even know what services they offer and the price of such. For example they did not know that there is a card that compiles several trip during the whole month so tat you can recharge it and not have to stop every single time in front of the ticket dispensing machines. It took us to travel on their suggestion to three major stations to find out that this service was not sold in the other stations but rather in the one we were to begin with. No refund to us for their mistake and nowhere to find someone to complain for this in English.In a nutshell. You'll have to learn it yourself and deal with it. No friendly user systems and no English speaking on site across the entire system. Very disappointing for a Metropol such as Seoul with millions of tourist every day converging and commuting specially by Metro system.Good luck and so may God help you :)", January 2020
25,5.0,The Best Metro I’ve Ever Used,-Clean-Easy to use for English speakers-Expansive stations-Extensive system of stations/stops-On time -Safe, January 2020
26,4.0,"Very easy, transit card system a little different","Easily accessible and the best way to get around Seoul. Some tips:1. Easiest method is to buy a TMoney card at any convenience store, and load money onto that. The caveat (and the reason I don't give it 5 stars) is that it is CASH ONLY whenever you do, either at the store or at the station kiosks. Seoul is a very card friendly city but this is the big thing you'll need cash for.2. Google Maps is not great in Seoul, however it DOES work for public transit. 3. Highly recommend taking it to and from the airport. Taxis will run you around 50,000 won4. Screenshot your directions before leaving. I don't recall the wifi being that great in the stations and on the trains.", December 2019
27,5.0,Easy way to get around Seoul,"The Metro is easy to use. Get a T-money card which can be used on the subway, buses, many taxis, and at several convenience stores. It makes life so much easier. It's the best way to get to many different neighborhoods across Seoul. I loved it!", January 2020

30,5.0,Efficient but watch out for last trains,"Efficient transport system that is real easy to navigate. Do consider the timing - if you’re taking a late train, check whether it’ll bring you to your destination or they may just stop halfway and you’ll be stranded and forced to take a taxi. Buses may be a better option if you’re taking a train around 11pm.", January 2020
31,5.0,Road Trip ,"Seoul Subway System is a lot like either New York City or London. 9 million people on the move. For the equivalent of $2 you can go anywhere.

The hardest thing might be buying the ticket, but plenty of people willing to help.", January 2020

40,5.0,Seoul Metro,"What a great travel system this is. So clean, easy to get around and inexpensive. We bought a travel card and put 10,000 won on it at a 7 eleven store and that lasted 8 days of city travel every day. It is easy to to travel as the lines are colour coded. The announcements are in Korean and English. The electronic display inside the carriages, is spoken in Korean and English as well as written.  Signs in the stations also have an arrow showing you what the next stop is in English. There is no eating or drinking on the subways so the area is clean. People are respectful and we felt safe even late at night. A great way to get around. There are quite a few stairs but usually you can find a lift as well. The shops are also amazing in the subways. Fully recommend using this transport system.", January 2020

I've downloaded an app called Seoul Subway which seriously helped a lot.People in Seoul are generally OK except for the fact that they rarely say ""excuse me"" even in Korean so expect a lot of sudden pushing, shoving when someone needs to get on & off. I still do my basic of saying excuse me & thank you which helps that little bit.", December 2019

49,5.0,Piece of cake visiting Seoul with the Metro,"The Seoul Metro is efficient and one of the cheapest way to travel in Seoul.  Get a T-Money card and forget about getting the single trip tickets which can be a pain during busy time with many tourists trying to do the same.  All stations we visited do have escalators in at least one of their exits but it could be a long walk if it is not the exit you needed.  Do look out for the signs for the dedicated seats for the pregnant, disabled and elderly if you are not one of these.", December 2019

51,5.0,Best in the world,"Honestly the best subway in the world - so easy to navigate, especially with the app. Was actually enjoyable to travel, and the journey themselves were very quick and convenient. I like how there are seats for the elderly and pregnant women, and no one else sat in them - unless the carts were completely packed and there were no elderly people/pregnant people around. Very affordable - only £1 per journey, and the t-money card is very convenient - I especially liked the range of designs you can choose. Convenience stores can also be found at most stops which was really helpful", August 2019

54,3.0,Beware of old people when travelling with young children,"Whilst the metro has better than average step free access, the directions were often confusing to the discerning tourist. However, what is annoying and its probably a cultural thing is the older generation when travelling with small children, they will actively come over and touch your child without your consent even if you have covered their faces with a hat as they will remove it to look and take pictures. I found this disturbing, also there are certain older gentlemen who were staring at our girls in a peculiar way and only looked away after I confronted them. So for this i am only giving a 3 and a warning to people thinking of travelling with young children.", December 2019

57,5.0,Very convenient and cheap!,"There is no better way then you travel by the metro if you want to save money. It is time consuming sitting on the metro to get to your location, but trust me when I say it saves a lot of money. Every time you use the metro, it takes 1250₩. When you transfer, it takes a transfer fee between 200₩ to 500₩. You won’t transfer between a lot of subway lines. Maximum usually three transfers. The subway is very very easy to use, sometimes it can be confusing with all the signs to locate where to go, but they show you in English and say in English what the next stop is. The metro gets very very busy during rush hour. Sometimes you’ll be waiting in line and won’t get on until the third subway that passes by. Usually rush hour is around 4pm – 6pm since that is when people get off work. However, do not be afraid since a new train comes by every 5 – 10 minutes. The subway runs until 12am the latest and there are designated seating area for elders, pregnant women, individuals who have physical accessibility needs, and also individuals with luggages.", December 2019

60,5.0,Great place to get around the city,"The Korean Metro is one of the easiest metro mass transit system. Even without knowing their local language, you can probably figure out their metro lines and get to where you need to go. Just get used to the machines to purchase your metro card...

They can speak good English. Do take not of the exit number of your destination too if not you can end up walking and crossing more.Getting off at the correct station and the exit is one thing, you also need to know which direction to walk to.

It took an hour ( other trains takes about 30 mins, pay at least 2500 won).", December 2019
65,5.0,Super efficient,"I recommend you download the Seoul Subway apps and travelling anywhere in Seoul is super easy. Seoul has a very big subway network.

Some station have many exits, and there are signages that tells you which exit to take to go to a particular tourist spot.

When you're on the platform, each stop has a sign that shows the stops just before & just after the one where you're standing.  I especially liked that there are two sets of sliding glass doors--one on the platform doesn't open until the train is there with doors open.  No way to fall onto the tracks!  Most of the subway stations we saw had free and clean restrooms.", November 2019
69,5.0,Clean and efficient ,"Metro, tube or subway, every city has similar system. Difference is the language and the ease for passengers. Seoul Metro trains are wide, clean, with clear indication of the next station (in Korean and English) and which side the door opens. Stations are clean and well posted. At the platform, they indicate which is the next and preceding station so you know the direction of travel. There is even a visual sign that tells you the train is approaching a preceding station, leaving it and arriving at where you are. And to top it all, theres a fanfare music announcing the approaching train (like the fanfare one hears when Ryanair has safely landed).

72,5.0,"Efficient, clean and pretty comfortable.","Amidst the complicating train network, it is comforting to note that the trains itself are clean and they generally run on-time.

73,4.0,great system once you learn it,"Once you understand the system it is really quite easy...  With limited English we used our observations.  Approaching trains are signalled with a musical tune.  There are lines - diagonal for entry/exit on the platform.   While on the subway, if the station is one you can change lines on, it plays a tune.   The biggest challenge we faced was exiting the subway.  There are up to 14 exits which pop you up on the street in VERY different locations.  Locals were always keen to help and assist, however more than often unable to due to language difficulties.", October 2019

77,1.0,Do you feel lucky?,"Depending on the station or station interchange, you may be fortunate and not get stuck trying to get in or out.  We've had pretty much experienced the gamut over the course of 5 visits: Not being able to leave the station after riding to destination station due to ticket malfunction, not being able to successfully buy a ticket from their machines, not being able to transfer from one line or another due to ticket malfunction and even when using T Money card, having to buy 2 or 3 tickets to be able to successfully get to destination...I have a small collection of metro cards from Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taipei, Bangkok, Japan, Mexico City etc.  that I keep for return visits and the T Money card is the only one I got a refund for.  They need to seriously upgrade their station ticket readers.  Otheriwise it is an exercise in frustration.  I feel for the ones who have to use it daily.The only line that has worked seamlessly every time for me has been the express train from ICN to Seoul station.  NB:  Should you find yourself unable to exit a station, go to the gated ticket gate and press the monitored help button.  You'll get someone who won't be able to speak english but they will eventually buzz and let you out...Good Luck!", February 2019

143,4.0,Tips on T-Money for new visitors to Seoul,"Some personal tips for new visitors:1. Buy a T-Money card for 3k won. Vending machines in metro stations offer options for 7k, 4k & 3k won. For 3k, you get one regular T-Money card. For 4k, u get a fancy looking card. For 7k, you get 2 fancy-looking cards. (Thankfully, i needed 2 cards this trip!!)2. I can confirm T-Money card saves U time, especially during rush hours. If u take a bus-metro combo trip, u could save a fair bit of money, provided u don't take too long for the transit. 3. Download KoreaTransit app to find the best routes from A to B, typically a combination of bus & metro. This app is not perfect but it's definitely one of the best public transportation app I've used so far. (In my view, better than a couple of Singapore apps I've used for Singapore.)4. One time, I could tap going in, but I couldn't tap out. Red signal came on & gate wouldn't open. No guard or attendant around to help me. Caused me a bit of panic, betore a local showed me to a nearby gate which opened without tapping out. To be sure I wouldn't get ""penalized"" i tapped the in-gate again but didnt go in. I found out next day from card balance i was charged for an ""additional"" trip. But its OK  - ""peace of mind"" for me to know the card still works ok. 5. T-Money worked for me in Seoul & Gyeongju. Understand it will work in Busan where Im heading next. And yes, i can confirm u can recharge at most C-stores without any service fee.", October 2019

182,5.0,Take the Green Line and Circle Seoul,"You can go everywhere you want in Seoul on the green line - no 2 - which runs in a circle on the north and south sides of the Han river. It takes about 2 hours to complete the circle, or more accurately, the oval. All the main tourist attractions are accessible from the Green Line.Avoid the many cross lines - unless you are in a hurry and know what you are doing.Buy the Seoul MICE card which you can top at at machines at the stations, near the turnstiles. A single journey is 1,250 won - about US 80 cents. It's a bargain!The larger stations are set in large underground shopping malls selling clothes, shoes, coffee, rice cakes and much more. There can be up to 8 station entrances - the entrances are distinctive on the footpaths.The carriages are the cleanest I have seen in a subway system. And everyone is so polite: You queue for the doors to open. The carriages are crowded at peak hour and not at other times. Check the maps before you board to check you are going in the right direction. The maps and the signs inside the carriages and on the station are in both Korean and English, which make it a easy to navigate. Highly recommended.", September 2019
183,4.0,Download their app before you go,If you download their app your stay in Seoul will be a lot better. It works without wifi. You can plan a route and it will tell you what trains to take and a map of the stations blinking. Some newer stations are bigger than some airports and some older stations are so small that the platforms are so small that if it wasn't because there are doors at the edge of the platform people would definitely fall on the tracks. It is like any other big city subway system but their signs are much better. Some signs on the street at the entrance will show where the train is so you don't have to rush downstairs. The exits are numbered so you never exit the station and find yourself in the middle of nowhere.   If you are meeting people just tell them the station name and exit number. It is fast and convenient. There is a lot of underground walking if you are changing trains. The worst part is that Koreans like to walk with their eyes on their phones instead of ahead of them so be careful not to get run over by a Korean watching tv while walking. There are lots of stairs not too many escalators in the old stations., October 2019

200,5.0,Cheap and efficient ,"At first I was a bit taken about by the Seoul metro.  The route map was really extensive and each station has a number. But after a short while, getting to places in straight forward. Seoul Metro stations are HUGE.  Some have areas that serve as shopping malls (largely for women). They seemed to have dug deep and far. You could be walking a fair distance to transfer from one line to another. The trains are comfortable and spacious (especially by London standards) and not as tightly packed like London or Hong Kong. But then again, the journeys aren't as stressful. Language wise, announcements are made in Korean, English, Manderin and Japanese. There is little pushing, Koreans are very polite and orderly. Again, unlike London and Hong Kong. There is usually a seat free, but it's custom to give to older people. This is often obused in Hong Kong, usually by youths and mainland tourists. But in Korea, its expected and there are seats at the end of the carriage that are specifically for old people and you're not allowed to sit on them unless there are no old people. Even then, most people will avoid them. There is little chatter and despite the amount of people, it's not noisy. Don't worry, the trains are long and cone at regular intervals. Safety is not really a concern, it seems most are law-abiding. The stations are clean (the aged ones don't seem it, but are) and some platforms have stalls selling food, drink or clothes. What's really considerate are the cupboards and racks that contain breathing apparatus and torches, in case of an emergency. That's really thoughtful. I can't see it bring done in London, due to budget or health & safety reasons. In Hong Kong, they'd be vandalised by youths or taken as souvenirs by mainland tourists.  The Seoul metro isn't just a metro system, its pretty much a regional rail service in its own right. Just remember to get your T-money card.", September 2019

It can get confusing with so many rail lines (identified by colours and number) and sometimes transferring between stations is not so straight forward due to the names of the station and it takes a while to figure out which direction one should be going to when changing to a different line.

The stations have many markings on overhead signs as well as on the floor; and color coding also helps guide one in the right direction.  In addition, there are several underground shopping areas that are convenient to the subway stations, making shopping a joy.  As an added convenience, the stations have electronic monitoring to let you know how soon the next train will arrive at the station; and the punctuality of the trains is excellent.

236,5.0,"Great Engineering, Remarkably Cultural, and Dirt Cheap","Normally I don’t review public transportation systems.  They’re not something to see or do: they’re a means to get to something you want to see or do.  The exceptions—the times when a public transportation system actually IS an attraction—are pretty obvious: San Francisco’s cable cars, Valparaiso’s ascensors, Taipei’s Maogong Gondola, Innsbruck’s Nordkettenbahnen, etc.  Kiev’s Arsenalna Metro station is a bona fide attraction--biggest elevator in the world.  But most public transport runs from boring to aggravating.  Horse-drawn carriages, pulled rickshaws, the elephant rides at the Amber Palace, and the camel rides in Giza, are things to do, not public ways of getting around.  But the Seoul subway system is not only an excellent public transport system, but one that adds flourishes of art and culture as well.  Here I’ll just note one impressive engineering detail, one cultural artefact that any major museum in North America would give its eye-teeth to get; and a travellers’ tip.Engineering: Walk up to the tracks and no further.  A platform-long, floor-to-ceiling transparent panel runs alongside the track.  Its doors slide open only when a train has stopped, and those trains stop so accurately that the entire entrances to the cars, and not an inch more or less in either direction, are accessible.  This of course prevents your being jostled off the platform, or accidentally falling onto the tracks just as the train roars into the station.  A few months ago a fellow committed suicide by jumping in front of an arriving train in San Francisco’s BART system.  Naturally all the commuters in that station at the time was horrified: this was REALLY going to delay them.  In fact, the entire system shut down for an hour.  Had the same fellow attempted the same suicide in Seoul, he’d have been out of luck, or maybe in luck, but still alive either way.  In theory I suppose you could install a shield like that in existing subway systems like BART; but I suspect the tricky 21st century engineering bit isn’t the plastic wall: it’s the stopping of all trains at precisely the right spot on the rails.  No system dependent on human drivers could do that.Culture: If you take time to look around when you’re at a Seoul station, you can see some remarkable things.  At one station I was sitting on a curving multi-colour bench backed by an artsy wall and thin trunks of mature bamboo, with an old wooden beach chair and a Western-style toilet integrated into the seating for humour (Bench and Bamboo photo).  Sitting there, I noticed a polished black objet d’art atop four mythical Korean lions in the middle of the pedestrian traffic, with four red-taped stanchions alerting folks to walk around it (Objet d’art photo).  Every time a train came in, scores of folks would swarm out, making for the exits, without even glancing at whatever it was.  I got up and found a tiny plaque stating that it was an ancient Korean sundial.  And what an exquisite bronze sundial!  Instead of just a flat dial, it has a central semi-sphere circled by a flat perimeter dial as well.  I believe that the yellow-edged gnomon is a modern recreation.  The astronomical engravings and calligraphy were in pristine condition, with just two or three tiny chips along the outer edge (Sundial photo).  The most astonishing thing, other than it being in the middle of a Metro station walkway, was its casting date: 1435 C.E!  That was during the reign of Sejeon the Great, who revolutionized Korea’s writing system, and sponsored the golden age of ancient Korean science.  Jang Yeong-sil was a scientist who used an iron printing press decades before Johannes Gutenberg, and invented improved rain gauges, water gauges, water clocks, and a wide range of astronomical instruments, including sundials.  Jang and his co-scientists created the “angbu-ilgu” (“pot-shaped sun clock staring at the sky”).  There’s one at Gyeongbokgung, out in the sun, a fitter place for a sundial than down in a Metro station, but exactly the same as this one!    To put the antiquity of this sundial into perspective: in 1435 the richest, most cultured, and most powerful state in Western Europe was the Grand Duchy of the West (stretching from Friesland and Flanders through Burgundy to the Alps, but long gone by 1500); the most powerful state in the Indian subcontinent was the Vijayanagara Empire (the first Mughals wouldn’t show up till the next century); the Eastern Roman emperor still reigned in Constantinople; the princes of Muscovy were still under the Tartar Yoke; the Incas were nomadic tribesmen who hadn’t even founded Cuzco yet; and Henry the Navigator’s captains were still struggling to get past the Western Sahara on the African coast.  To put the location of this sundial into perspective: Can you imagine transferring at a Berlin U-Bahn station and seeing a 1455 Gutenberg Bible on display in the middle of the traffic flow as you head to the other line?  Or spotting a 1434 Jan Van Eyck painting hanging on the wall at London’s Bond Street or Embankment station?  They’ve actually got a 1434 Van Eyck in London, but it’s prominently displayed at the National Gallery, not down in a Tube station!And yes, I did discover cultural touches at several other stations, though not at all.Traveller’s Tip:  Whether you’re landing in Incheon or Gimpo, the 5000-won “All Stations” ticket will get you and your luggage from the airport to whatever Metro station is nearest to your hotel: that’s less than 4 Euros, and slightly more than 4 US dollars.", August 2019

I'm surprised that the fares are affordable and you can get to anywhere in Seoul quite conveniently. The bad thing which I remember most is that some subway stations are not stroller friendly. For example, Myeongdong station, there are 10 entrances to the subway but only 1 has elevator access. Even then it only brings you the concourse level and not entirely to the subway level causing you to carry your toddler out of the stroller and walk or carry the stroller with the toddler with it which is just pain and suffering.", August 2019

258,5.0,Easiest way to get around,"If you've been to Singapore then the Seoul metro is very similar. Ticket machines are easy to use and a single trip is roughly $2 AUD per person and you get a refund on the ticket at the end of the trip.We had a couple of problems with the machines, if you put coins in too fast the transaction will cancel and once we had a ticket that we could not refund.The announcements are in multiple languages and the trains are all air conditioned. Like Singapore there is no access to the lines so no accidents of falling onto the tracks or people running from one platform to the other.There are food stalls and markets at most stations.Not all levels have escalators so if you have luggage, sometimes it's a haul up stairs.The afternoon knock off is always busy, but with trains roughly every 2 minutes it's no big deal to wait for the next one.You'll find most Koreans are fairly rude when entering/exiting and it's not uncommon to see elderly people pushed out of the way.  There is no real chivalry for seating either but then again this is the liberal age.Overall easy to use and a lot cheaper than a taxi.", August 2019

If you have any difficulties, please don't hesitate to go to the information office and ask questions and you will be very kind to help. And it is more convenient to use the card than to use cash, and the deposit of the card is refunded. Using the Metro from Seoul is one of the best ways to enjoy the city.One caveat is for the elderly and pregnant, and it is Korean manners not to sit down even if the seats are available.서울의 지하철은 세계 최고수준입니다. 깨끗하고 빠르며 안전하고요. 목적지만 선택할 수 있다면 지도를 보고 쉽게 이용이 가능합니다만, 노선이 많아 어려움을 느낀다면 인포메이션 창구로 가서 도움을 요청할 수 있습니다. 그러면 매우 친절하게 알려줍니다. 현금보다는 카드 이용을 권하고, 이용권은 반납하면 보증금을 돌려받을 수 있습니다. 유의사항 한가지는 노약자석이나 임산부 전용석이 있는데, 자리가 비었더라도 앉지 않는게 한국의 매너이다.", October 2018

For my son's time, all you needed was an app. It's very easy to go around South Korea if you had a wifi connection and a naver app. It shows the fastest way to reach your destination and what train to take. It also tells you which way had the shortest walking and transfer of trains. I just love the transport system in Korea. It's easy and fast. I wish they had an unlimited transport card for tourists like us. But the trains were clean, safe and people were very polite, it was so quiet in the train . Visit South Korea friends, going around the tourist spots was easy through the Seoul metro.", May 2019

269,5.0,Very clean and efficient.,"While not as good as the Tokyo Metro, in my opinion, the Seoul Metro is still one of the best in the world and depending on the day, I'd put it at number 2 or 3. Very clean, very fast and very efficient. Cost effective as well. One downside is that the people who ride it are not as quiet and reserved as in Japan and you will hear lots of people on their mobiles or being loud.", July 2019
270,4.0,Easy to Use,You can find everything you need in English to get around. Taxis in Seoul are difficult to hail as there are restriction as to where they can stop so you really have to find a taxi stand and taxi drivers English can be limited.

275,5.0,Remains an excellent metro network,"Seoul's Metro has risen from nothing 50 years go and overall is a great rail network.Station numbering plus bi-lingual signage in Korean and English help one to navigate.A few station interchanges can be confusing to first time users, particularly the larger ones.The Seoul station transfer to AREX is cumbersome but it remains a better option than the airport bus or driving, because the latter two are subject to traffic congestion.Metro trains are frequent, fast between stations safe and extremely clean.  Users tend to be courteous, far more so than in mainland China.The T Money card strangely can only be topped up in cash, but can be purchased using a credit card.  It can be used in Seoul, Busan and other cities, a feature not available with similar public transport smartcards in Australia.There were very few Seoul Metro staff visible.  Platform screen doors minimise injuries though.I did not see any inoperable escalators or lifts.It would be better if which entrances and exits had lifts were more clearly indicated as this would help visitors travelling with luggage as we were, not to mention the elderly, mums with prams, disabled and those with lots of shopping bags.", July 2019
