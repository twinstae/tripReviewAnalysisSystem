9,5.0,Interesting museum for all ages,"I planned to go here mainly for my boys (Ages 9 and 6) because they wanted to see tanks and planes but I surprisingly learned a lot. The guide we had, Mr. Kim was very knowledgeable and it was so interesting to see how grateful he was to the US and their help. He says if it wasn't for the US and their help, they would be a communist country under North Korea. It was interesting to hear the history from someone who actually experienced it. Definitely a must see!", January 2020
10,5.0,Easy to find at the samgaki line on the blue or orange lines.  five minute walk.,one of the must see museums in my opinion.  they did a great job presenting the Korean war and its immediate aftermath.  the museum used to be a bit too much propaganda but they have make it more objective = gone are the famous pictures of the happy children of South Korea and the starving children of North Korea.  that was a bit too much in my opinion.  the museum is close to the national museum (see my review) and the Samsun ilan museum in near by Itaewon.  Itaewon is still a good bet for lunch or dinner after musuem hopping., December 2019

Wonderful displays inside. The memorial hall caused me to reflect deeply on the toll of human life that was lost. We sat in on an interactive presentation in a theater where the seats moved and we were right in the nose cone of a bomber plane, right on the landing beach, right in the middle of an air fight... Oh, my, so realistic and well done. Don't miss this!", October 2019
49,5.0,Quiet and peaceful time at the memorial,"The memorial is easy to get to by train, and it is very quiet and not crowded with tourists.

There are displays of ancient arrowheads and things like that, as well as displays covering warfare in the area for the past thousand years etc.  One of the better ""war theme"" musuems I've visited.  It's very educational, and ""dense"", so not sure if it would be great for kids TBH.  But historically important to understand what happened in Korea and why it is divided etc.  I recommend this museum but only if you find the topic really interesting / enjoy history.

There is the usual displays of military hardware but there is a very informative section on the Korean War and how things got to be where they are today. Check ahead to find out if there are performances on the huge parade square that showcase Korea’s traditional and modern army, it is colourful and interesting to watch.

72,5.0,Half a day at least,"First visited with my 8 year old twins in Sep. Entrance is free. I truly enjoyed the complimentary English tour conducted by a lady in her 70s who lived through the war. Her stories we so captivating and touching I had to hold my tears in many occasions.  We didn’t get to visit the Children’s Museum as it was fully booked but the kids spent more than an hour playing at the play area outside the Children’s museum. They were in awed with the fighter jets and tanks on display. Just visited the museum again today with my 15year old, our English guide today was a 17 year old high school boy. He was well versed with the basic history and professional with the job assigned. However, nothing beats having the story told by one who had first hand experience but it’s not fair to compare with the 17 year old as I think he did put effort to do his best. We spent 3 hours going through all the exhibits with a coffee break in between at the cafe on ground floor. They serve nice coffee, bun with red bean and cream filling and especially love their ciabatta sandwich with chicken and cheese filling. Will go back again for the Children’s museum.", October 2019
73,5.0,This is an amazing museum!,"This is not a war museum.  This is the Korean War museum.  It is beautiful and incredible. If you have a heart it will bring tears to your eyes.

88,5.0,Well Presented,"I have visited the War Memorial of Korea over the past several years and it seems to improve with each visit.  The information is well presented and honors Soldiers from all nations that contributed to the war efforts.  There are many floors/exhibitions to visit and it can be a bit much for just one visit - thankfully the museum is easily access from the metro (just off Samgaki Station - line 4 or 6, exit 10/12 or Namyeong Station - line 1, exit 1) and general admission is free.  There is an outdoor exhibit for children and the interior is appropriate for all ages, may appeal more to older children.

89,5.0,Impressive!!! ,"Seoul has many state funded museums and forms the ones I've visited or know of, all are well presented. It seems little is spared to put on a hood, high quality show. The National War Museum is no different. It showcases her military history from the earliest period up to the Korean War. You'd be surprised that Korea is not the doormat people perceive. But a proud and sophicated nation. There are things on display that you would not expect and not mentioned in books elsewhere. I've seen pictures of the turtle boat, but to sea in person is a nice experience. Yes is a scaled replica, but it's still impressive. There is also the large outdoor display. With a number of Korean War period planes and tanks. Also other retired items of hardware. You'd have to pay good money to see this elsewhere, but all free in Seoul. There is a B52 bomber, which is smaller than I thought. At the time of my visit, done halls and the outdoor display was closed off for maintenance. There are plenty of toilets, most displays have English and I suppose the only let down is that the giftshop. You can spend a fair few hours here.", September 2019

113,1.0,Amazing museum but racist worker,"Very interesting museum but the wonderful visit were wasted by some racist worker. As we were waiting for the line for an animated room (incheon landing 4D simulation) with a 15 people capacity and 30minutes long waiting line between the sessions, the staff member who were in charge of the line had the audacity to put first 4 korean girls who came after us. Indeed, she went to talk to them then one of them started to give us some weird glances. Then when it was the time to enter the room the 4 Korean girls quickly  took the 3D glaces and run in the entry. We were 3 and she came to us at the end to give us the glaces but only 2 remained...when we told her that we were there before and we were going in together she went to give the glaces to the people behind us. We tried to complain but she brushed us off and completely ignored us. Even though we stayed very polite we were really disappointed by this unfair experience.", August 2019

121,5.0,Exceptional Museum! ,"Honestly one of the best Museums I have been too! Well spaced out, clean and taken care of. You can feel the respect for their history in the information and atmosphere you see and feel.  No charge but donations welcome. Free English speaking tour at 10am & 1pm, we unfortunately missed those but I have no doubt they would be great.  English signage and leaflets all round, shows/videos and 4D available in English. Toilets on every level and so fresh and clean. The best bit for us was the children’s museum, fantastic interactive areas free of charge for a set 50min.  There is a playground outside for the children to burn off energy and a few cafe to get snacks and ice cream, also blox (Lego) area which looked great but we didn’t use.", July 2019
122,5.0,Outstanding Museum & History of Korea,"Sadly, Korea's history has been marred with warfare over the centuries.  But this museum is a great collection of this history with artifacts, interactive displays, and panoramas that take the visitor to some of these battles.  Also interesting to note are some of displays on the modern ROK military which is one of the strongest in the world.  The vastness of the museums reminds me of the Museum of the Great Patriotic War (WWII) in Moscow.", July 2019

125,5.0,Best war memorial and museum,"Huge collection, spanning early Korean history to most recent conflict in the Gulf.  As expected, there is a significant focus on the Korean War, but there is much, much more.  The outdoor exhibits are extensive, including a B52D from the Vietnam War.  The memorials are particularly meaningful  and well done.  There are many interactive exhibits, and plenty of English signage. This is easily a half-day visit, especially if you are interested in military conflict and Korean history.  Provides great imsight to military history on the Korean Peninsula.  Free entry. Easily the best war museum and memorial I have visited.", July 2019

127,5.0,Huge and full,"We were here a half day and did not nearly see it all.  We started with the outside area first coming upon the Clock Tower of Peace and then the Statue of Brothers.  From there we visited all the outdoor sights and particularly the Open-air Exhibition Area.  On a warm May day I really did not want to leave but there are very few places to sit and take a break and with standing, reading, and observing a nice short bench break would have been welcomed.  The first floor held a very interesting up to date exhibit (which may have been a special exhibit) about recent relations with North Korea.  Admission is free.  Be sure to grab a  free brochure as it will help you plan your time at the museum.", May 2019

130,4.0,Insightful in several ways,"The museum provides a well illustrated history of the painful Korean war. You leave the museum a lot wiser than you arrived. Certainly in terms of the events of the war, but perhaps more interesting, you have a much better sense of the pain and deep wounds this meaningless war has had on the people of Korean. Clearly the history and culture of Korean is deeply affected by the divide and you feel you understand this a little better after the visit. If you are interested in military equipment this is definitely also a good place to visit.", July 2019

132,5.0,Heartbreaking and educational,"We visited the War Memorial of Korea today. It was my second visit and it is well worth the time to explore. The building and grounds are beautiful and full of war relics. From prehistoric weapons, displays from different eras in Korean history to the high-tech displays to Admiral sun-shin's turtle ship- it is all here impressively displayed. Admission is by donation. The only suggestion that I would make is to have the address written in hangul on website (for the cab drivers). Be prepared to spend hours here. It's worth it.", July 2019
133,4.0,Interesting to visit,"Attempting to find one's way from the subway stations can be challenging since the signnage is very poor (exit 12 from Line 6 is the easiest, line 4 more difficult). The memorial itself, however, is well presented and I am sure it would be much more interesting to those with a military background.", June 2019
134,4.0,Good way to learn some Korean history...,"The area is big and there is a lot to see and learn. No entrance fee and you can learn a lot from the exhibit as there are a lot of things to see, hear, and experience. Suggest to put this in your agenda when visiting ROK.", June 2019

On Fridays, at 2 p.m. there is an exhibition of the various military branches in the front of the museum. This is where you experience the all female Color Guard, traditional martial arts, the various anthems of the military branches, and many other performances by the various military branches.

146,4.0,An excellent half day--or a day if you are really into this conflict.,"We came after lunch to the War Memorial. It has excellent programs that explain the war and the international coalition that brought the North Korean-Russian-Chinese forces to armistice. There are lots of details for those who love details and it is easy to choose what to focus on and what to pass on. There is lots of English interpretation, unlike some other museums in Korea, and many beautiful sculptural tributes to the many soldiers who gave their lives. Korea lost just over 170,000 soldiers and God knows how many civilians. Just over 10,000 Americans died. There is no entry fee, there are a number of good video programs and there is a coffee shop if you suffer from museum eyes after a while. For Americans especially I think this is a good way to understand something of the very special bond that exists between Koreans and Americans. One thing it could do better is to illustrate the cultural rifts between North and South that existed for centuries before the conflict. This dividing line is not just a creature of the Cold War. Coming during the week would be a good idea. We were there on a Thursday afternoon and found plentiful parking. I'd certainly go again.", May 2019
147,5.0,Multimedia Narrative History and Artifacts,"Great, free, museum about conflict on and over the Korean peninsula from ancient to modern times.  I spent 2.5 hours here and still didn't see, read everything.  A wonderful mix of multi-media (movies, actual US/ROK and captured equipment, wax museum like staging, and other artifacts.

Although I'm not really interested in military history, I found an impressive and informative range of displays on the history of war on the Korean Peninsula and an expression of hope for the future. To be honest, I found it all a little unsettling, but it's very well presented and there is an area for kids to learn the history. There's also a wide-ranging display of military aircraft, tanks, missiles, etc, that you can get up close to. Worth a visit, even if military history isn't your thing. Free entry.", May 2019

155,5.0,Amazing place,This is quite amazing. Its free and it tells the story of war through the ages. there are lots to look at and many movies explaining the history of the Korean empire. It tells every aspect of the story even the peace keeping aspect of the Korean military. I was very moved by the memorials outside the museum thanking the different nations helping the people of South Korea., October 2018
156,1.0,Shocking ,"Well....it definitely IS a WAR museum. I found it simply obnoxious. We were led into a movie play which encountered me to be more like a counter strike video game. It was a 4d movie! Sitting there and watching the invasion of Incheon through a soldiers eye.... ok.... not my idea of a „war museum“(that is supposed to be dealing with the terror of war)..... but when these soldiers started to fire at their own -but north- korean people I was just simply shocked. I have never ever seen such an impiety before. It all reached its peak when some american tourists wanted to start clapping at the end of the „show“. But they wouldn’t dare to as we all looked shocked and pissed and wouldn’t want to clap. The rest of this museum is ok but it rarely displays the terror of war, it even more glorifies it. It took me a few days to get rid of this disgusted feeling when I left the museum. It’s more like US Propaganda.", June 2018
157,5.0,Interesting,Spent the morning there and it's a must to see. It's wonderfully kept for you to wander around and take in the past.

162,4.0,Quite impressive,Originally we did not plant to visit the musem but we were happy that we decided otherwise. We leaned quie a lot about the so called forgotten war and the museum is a good mix of information and memorials. Also the outside part with an actual B52 bomber is worthwhile, April 2019
163,5.0,Extensive museum of the history of war in Korea,"This is a massive museum providing information about wars and military strategy throughout the history of Korea (and, now, South Korea).  While an English Language tour was provided, it started out focusing intensely (in terms of time invested) on the ""Korean War"" (which I suppose is what most English speakers want to know about).  We were hoping for more of an overview of the museum, so we left the group early.  It took us 2 hours to see the entire museum quickly.  All signage is in English.", April 2019

I have been there, but I didn't remember well. And I knew I was totally wrong. we had 5 hour there but it was not enough time for see there. Long Long time ago Korea had war and war again a lot too many time. so if you know the war of Korea you will know about Korea history, nationality, geography ... it was my best part of trip. don't think too much Just go there and see about Korea.

Such an interesting display., February 2019
185,5.0,Free entry daily (except Monday) to a meaningful museum,"For history buffs like myself, you should set aside at least half a day for this sprawling war memorial and museum. The outdoor section includes symbolic monuments, planes, tanks, and a 4-D video exhibit about heroic South Korean sailors which made me tear with emotion. The indoor section has 3 levels which you should start from the bottom. It starts from the evolving of Korea from even B.C. times all the way post-Korean War - that's literally two thousand years of warring history. There are plenty of exhibits and videos and 4-D experiences.

186,5.0,Great place to gain perspective of warfare on Korean peninsula ,"This museum is great place to gain a good perspective on the history of warfare on the Korean peninsula as well as the Republic of Korea's involvement in warfare elsewhere (Vietnam, etc.).  The museum often has guided tours and offers self-paced tours with recorded explanations in a variety of languages available for use.  The museum is large and exhibits are extensive so you should allot no less than 2-3 hours to do the place justice.  I was there a half day and still sort of rushed through a couple of areas.
