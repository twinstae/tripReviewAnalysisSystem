0,4.0,Good mix of old and new architecture,"Interesting Campus with a mixture of buildings, nice to walk around.  Close to Bongwa temple and the area of EWAH is fun and interesting to explore.", February 2020
1,2.0,Don't come here,It's disappointing because it's closed for tourists because of corona virus pandemic. Come when corona virus ia gone, February 2020
2,4.0,Must visit!,Very historical university. Beautiful campus with a mixture of historical and modern architecture. Visited during winter and the campus outlook would be good for photography enthusiasts, January 2020
3,3.0,Spot for Photo opp and for shops,"There are 3 spots here that make good photo backdrop for your Seoul trip album. The oldish colonial building with magnificent steps (very British), the modern design wide concrete slope that leads to the steps in the background, and the flower beds. After the photoshoot, head for the shops in the area for what Seoul is known for; fashion and cosmetics. Easy access to the place as it has its Metro station and a bus stop where you can head for other places when you are done with the photography and the shopping.", December 2019
4,4.0,Iconic university ,The university is impressive. Physically and academically. But many people come here for the shopping. Less crowded then Myeondong but probably same price. The problem as in most Korean shops is that they do not display price and you have to ask for it and become suspicious that the price is not fixed., September 2019
5,5.0,Beautiful university!,"Honestly I visit Ewha, because of how beautiful the architecture is there and not for the shops around the university. Sure going towards the massive campus you have several different stores, but by all means focus on the beautiful architecture of the university.", June 2019
6,5.0,Spring 2019 üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß,It was our 4th family holidays in Seoul and first time stayed in Seodaemun area.We stayed in this area for our first 3 nights and it was a walking distance to ewha shopping area.We also went exploring the Ewha University for our second time visit (first was in 2017) Here there not many halal restaurant but we usually take away the chicken rice at Halal Singapore Chicken Rice.And it easily went to other areas by subway., May 2019
7,2.0,"Great for women, awful for anyone else","As with most of Korea, geared towards women. So if you‚Äôre here for clothes shopping it‚Äôs a Mecca! A few places to avoid- baviphat- popular cosmetics shop, but with fake prices on everything - you don‚Äôt know until you pay. There are also a couple of men‚Äôs suit shops, no prices on anything and some with fake prices, all owners exceptionally rude. Don‚Äôt buy ANYTHING for men here if you don‚Äôt want to be ripped off and of course it goes without saying for any smart foreign guest- don‚Äôt buy if there is no price tags", May 2019
8,4.0,A nice university,I come here with my closed friend. It's a nice university with a good landscape. Ewha is the combination of East and West about architecture. The entrance is very huge. Nice place to walk!, December 2018
9,3.0,Street in front of Ewha Woman's university.,"C ( 18.10.29 )I visited there on my way to promise. There was good to foreign traveler, but for Korean there was just normal street. Once upon a time, there was crowded by traveler and shopper, but now just so-so.", October 2018
10,1.0,Worst shoe shop owner ; ewha uni shopping street,"Don‚Äôt ever go to the shoe shop at the end of one of the alleys. The owner threw the shoe, shouted at us and tried stopping us from exiting when we didn‚Äôt want to buy the shoes we were trying.", September 2018
11,3.0,A faded glory,"The street was famous of its 10,000 won bags and 1,000 won socks in the past years.  However, when I visited last week, many of these shops were closed and therefore, my choices were very limited.", July 2018
12,3.0,Not worth a visit unless you're really into makeup,"I wasn't terribly impressed with Ewha Fashion Street - a LOT of Korean makeup brands at the same price you'd find in a major US city ""Koreatown."" I found it especially baffling that 2 major brands would not sell single sheet masks, but wanted me to buy a minimum of 30! How am I supposed to commit to 30 (for about $65) when I don't know if I like it? I asked for the price for 10 or for 20 and they refused, even after I walked away (no counteroffer!).For fashion, we found much cuter clothes in the subway station itself - 5k won stylish t-shirts and 10k won pants and skirts; for accessories like bags, hats, and hair clips/pins, we preferred the shops in Myeongdong near Shinsaegae department store.Two standouts at Ewha:1) Olive Young--like a Korean version of Ulta--where there were some real bargains as well as bonus gifts and 10% off your 50k+ won purchase. Two branches on the same street (left and right)2) Art Box (one of the first shops closest to the subway) which had lots of cute Kakao character items, stationary, and knick knacks.Bummed that we didn't do better, but there's always a market or other district to try!", July 2018
13,4.0,For the young generation,"Great for shopping, targeted at the younger generation and ladies. Less crowded than Myeongdong so walking around was more comfortable. The street food carts also sells at a cheaper price. Not so much of skincare shops, it has mixture of clothes and accessories (socks, earrings etc). There is also a LINE store and I visited Ewha Woman's University.Visited here last year...", April 2018
14,4.0,Great shopping,"Great place to shop for cosmetics, fashions and knick knacks for good quality and under budget. For the men or those who would not want to shop, there are also many cafes and restaurants nearby.", May 2018
15,5.0,Excellent shopping street for cosmetics,"This is an excellent street for cosmetics, fashion and knick knacks. And good news for the men who don‚Äôt dabble with cosmetics, you get to comb the many food stalls, cafe and restaurants for food, drinks and snacks. I prefer this kind of streets to shopping centers which can be seen everywhere.You can easily spend 2-4 hours here wandering through the street and peering at every shops and stalls.", June 2018
16,5.0,Shopping at Ewha,Definitely a place for women who are into fashion. They provide a wide range of clothing for teenagers to young women and working adults. On good days you may get very good buy and quite a number of clothes are reasonably priced. They also have the higher end as well for those who do not mind paying., June 2018
17,5.0,Ewha Womans University Street,"Very nice shopping area for youngster, there is eatery everywhere. Shopping starts when you are out fron the train platform.", June 2018
18,5.0,A shopping street mostly for the youngsters,It is a shopping paradise for youngsters and students studying in the university. The things are so much cheaper than those in Myeondong and more variety too. The staff of the stalls and shops are also much friendlier than those in Myeondong. This will definitely my 'Must-Go' area for shopping the next time I visit Seoul., April 2018
19,4.0,shopping,"There are many korean brands cosmetics shop everywhere,  Ewha university is so close to the station, street foods are delicious.", May 2018
20,3.0,Famous university and some shopping and eatries...,"Ewha Women‚Äôs University is a famous place where people loves to take photos of the church building and the slope design building.There are many cheap eateries around the area and also sell most ladies clothes for obvious reason. üò¨Take note!There is a ‚Äòfamous‚Äô cosmetic shop. Please do not buy things from there! Though the items are cheaper than those already cheap in the stores, some of the items have expired or near expiry date! And you may not know if they are genuine as well!", April 2018
21,3.0,I was disappointed.,"Not that much shopping, though prices were significantly cheaper. All the clothes were similar and not much variety.", April 2018
22,4.0,Youthful ,Yes myongdong has more to offer but this is a university district and the clothes here are comparatively cheaper than dongdaemun and myeongdong area!, March 2018
23,5.0,Nice vibes !,There are alot of fashion stores here in Ewha women univ. The prices here are very mouth watering. You can buy alot of winter coats and jackets in a very cheap price if you go in winter (not sure about other season). The area near the university is so beautiful. Must visit !, February 2018
24,2.0,Nothing much to miss,You would find better in Myeongdong. Overrated street. Not really recommended for a tourist as you can find same or better products in Myeongdong., December 2017
25,5.0,Cheapest Deal Especially for Cosmetics,"What I like about Ewha University, not only that they have beautiful architecture and surroundings but also the street shops offer cheaper price than any other places in Seoul. Especially for cosmetics.In one of the shop called Baviphat, they sells extremely cheap stuff. Good idea for souvenirs. You should visit this place if you are around the area. Also, near the university, you can find a big LINE Store.", November 2017
26,5.0,Fashionable yet appropiate price for clothes and bag ,"The street is closed to 2,3 Exit from Ewha University Subway Station. This place is full with store of clothes, shoes,bag and accessories to food. Price are reasonable and most of the store are easy to find. You may visit to Ewha University before or after your shopping. Overall, it is a good place to explore.", November 2017
27,4.0,Relatively cheap compared to other areas,I was able to find a few relatively cheap coats and sweaters in a few shops along this street but must really dig deep for it. I like the general style of the clothes sold here., November 2017
28,5.0,Hunt for Cheap Deal,"I couldn't find what I liked in Insadong (1st day) and didn't know where else to look for young trendy fashion for my tween (mainly) and me (if there is anything suited me) in Seoul, I did a last minutes search and thanks to the TA, I came here for trying my luck, at the same to visit Ewha Women's University.From cosmetic to fashion to Korean unique creatives merchandise were all similar in all corners of Seoul, i believe. But I have to agree that this was peaceful shopping experience here than Myeongdong or Namdaemun. I enjoyed the leisure hunting here in the late afternoon and found some cheap buys.", October 2017
29,3.0,Not worth the visit,I am not really sure why this is listed as one of the must see shopping places in Seoul.  There is nothing unique or really that interesting about the shops here.  Dominated by the same cosmetic stores you see elsewhere it is a few blocks of shopping.  I would not go out of my way to come shopping here., September 2017
30,5.0,Trend setting fashion street  for young women,This area is famous for trend setting fashion among young women. Lots of university students shop here. We visited the area to shop after visiting Ehwa Womans University nearby. This area is very accessible by subway.  Prices were reasonable since the shops cater to the university students. We found some cheap handbags here., October 2016
31,4.0,Good place to shop,Comparable to Hongik University in Hongdae shopping area but not as big.  You should experience a visit here to compare.  I personally prefer Hongiik Univiersity area the prices are about the same and there are more stores to be found., May 2017
32,3.0,Lots of stores; beware: BAVIPHAT,"Many clothing and makeup stores as well as places to eat. Unfortunately, the clothing stores don't allow people to try on tops. However, you can try on bottoms. I'm not sure why...maybe because people are sweaty in this hot weather. There are many clothing stores that carry the same items so look around before buying.My main reason for posting this review is to warn others about a store called Baviphat. I was so excited to see makeup products being sold at such a cheap price. But I felt like something just was not right and the actual stores (e.g. Banila) were close by. The staff was also not very welcoming. Once I got wifi, I googled about this store and found out that they sell fakes! So be careful before buying from there.", July 2017
33,5.0,"If You're Shopping, Spend a Day Here","I really had a lot of fun shopping here. We came here in the morning, so I don't know how busy it gets later in the evening (after the work day and such), but it was a much more peaceful shopping experience here than Myeongdong. Pretty much every major Korean cosmetic brand has a few shops here (Innisfree, Etude House, etc) and a lot of smaller ones as well (like Holika Holika or Labiotte), so you can do a lot of your shopping here if you want. The deals seemed pretty good here too, but I'd already done the vast majority of my shopping in Busan so I didn't buy a lot of cosmetics in the area. You can spend HOUURRRRRRRRRRRRS here looking at clothes. There's something for almost everyone's style from super frilly and feminine to the more baggy sort of streetwear look. I actually didn't buy much, but I was pretty happy when I got a cute little denim jacket for something like 11000W - oh yeah, the prices here are great. There are lots of stores that just specialize in accessories too, like handbags, socks (yes, socks), jewelry, etc. There are also a few men's shops sprinkled around, so my boyfriend wasn't as horribly bored as he usually is on these shopping excursions, plus the neighborhood is pretty cool and interesting too. There were lots of carts selling street food all over the place if you want to get some snacks, but there are also tons of super adorable little cafes that you might want to save room for. We got some snacks early on, and then in the afternoon went to some cute little place run by a really nice lady that was at the end of a little walking alley, I think it was just off one of the ""main"" streets. I have no clue what the place was called (I don't even remember seeing a sign in Korean so I could attempt to deciper the Hangul), but it had a bunch of strawberries on the banner outside. Turned out EVERYTHING on the menu was made with strawberries. We had a couple of (delicious) jam sandwiches and some strawberry tteokbokki (which was still spicy, but with a nice strawberry flavor on it). We also had strawberry lemonade to drink. The restaurant seemed pretty popular with the local uni students as well (my boyfriend was the only guy there, hahah). If you ask around for the strawberry restaurant, maybe you'll have some luck, because I would totally recommend it if you can find it. Anyways, yeah, this is an awesome area to shop and I recommend it to anyone who plans on doing shopping while they're in Seoul. Myeongdong is fun and you should check it out, but this area is way more laid back and fun.", October 2016
34,4.0,Fashion haven,This is the best place to shop for good quality clothes. Price wise is on the higher side as compared to the normal market place but the design and quality is really good, July 2017
35,5.0,Budget Friendly Shopping Paradise,After visiting EWHA Uni we headed to the street shops along this area.  My daughter told me she felt like stars coming out from her eyes because of seeing trendy clothings and others.  Indeed it s a budget friendly shopping paradise.  Highly recommended if you are in a budget and the working public wifi added up to the experience., August 2016
36,5.0,Young people paradise,"There are lots of fashion shops in the area, especially you can easily find some cheap bags and mobile case in the area. I have bought a small bag which only cost me 10000 won. Besides, there are also several shops selling icecream, juice, coffee and other snacks which is suitable for chilling in the afternoon.", May 2017
37,4.0,Good Place for Shopping,"Ewha Fashion and Shopping Street can be an alternative than Myeongdong for cosmetics and fashion shopping. You can drop by Ewha Women University, take pictures in front of the famous Ewha main gate and explore the shopping street after. The main shopping street filled with mostly cosmetics shops. They have a wide range of brand options with reasonable price. You can also find street food vendors in the main street. Out of the main street, you can stroll to find fashion outlets also with a cheap price. That because their main customers are college students. However, for your notes, the clothes they sell here are not type of clothes you can wear for a long time. They are kind of clothes that keeping up with mode and season with short cycle. Also the reason for a cheap price. Line Cafe also available on the same street along with fashion outlets. I will truly recommend this place for everyone who wants to avoid the crowded Myeongdong.", April 2017
38,4.0,Shopping,Can go to the university to take photos first then go to the street to shop. Many pretty affordable clothes. There's stylenanda and line with friends store there as well so you can take photos there., May 2017
39,4.0,Great bargains,"This is an underrated shopping place in Seoul. Seriously, especially for ladies out there, this is the IT place for shopping! It‚Äôs not too crowded, the amount of shops is not that overwhelming, and shops give better offers here. Also, they sell clothes which are very affordable I guess it‚Äôs because they are catering to university students. Moreover, the fa√ßade of the university is so beautiful. Every spot was ‚Äúinstagrammable‚Äù that you couldn‚Äôt help but execute your blogger pose. It looked like it came straight out of a European garden book. Lastly, the famous underground complex was simply worth visiting. I myself was amazed at how massive the place was and how beautifully it was constructed. This university just made me jealous at the students who study here.", April 2017
40,5.0,Must Visit Shopping Gem,Always a must go/visit for my trip to Seoul :) must also eat their street food along the fashion street :) During Cherry Blossom season will get to see it there too :) Ewha University entrance cherry blossom tree is beautiful too, April 2017

47,4.0,Fun place to shop and roam around,The area is smaller and easier to explore compared to Dongdaemun or Myeongdong. The building where Line store is located is a must visit as there are a number of shops in every floor., November 2016
48,4.0,Love this shopping area!,"There's just so much you can buy here because of the affordable prices! You will be able to see many shops selling similar design of clothes and bags and shoes in other places but much more expensive. But here, price is good! Street food is good too:))", February 2017

54,1.0,Nice surroundings of shops but with average mean & agressive service manner,"After visiting Ewha front campus, it's within minutes of walk to reach these fashion street, it floods with shops selling owned or no brands of apparel. We did try 3 to 4 shops, and all of the shop people were very mean, long face and aggressive once you showed don't buy. It's a real bad name for Seoul, and visitors will ask if it was the national attitude of customer service for Korean. It just keep people away. Bad ! And hopefully it could be improved in the future.", December 2016
55,5.0,Your wife's favourite street,It has all of the shopping that a woman desire. The fashion street is big enough for you to shop for days but not much of a place to look for food. Some even visit there for a korean haircut!, December 2016
56,5.0,Great Shopping!,"This is a great street to go shopping for Korean fashion.  There are little shops and street vendors everywhere you look.  Trendy, cute, low priced items geared to young, college age students.  Plenty of things for older folks too, socks, jewelry, and much more.", November 2016
57,5.0,"Charming university town: Good views, Good prices.","How did I find out about Ewha Woman's university? I asked the tourist office where is the best place for a manicure/pedicure & hair styling services.....and they pointed to me Sinchon / Ewha Woman's university. At my first visit, I was just checking out the area. Alighted at Sinchon station and walked through Sinchon ""Pedestrian Friendly Street"" on Myeongmui-gil which connected us to Ewhayeodeae-gil.If you really want to visit the Universities and shop, you need the entire day here. Another way to get here directly is to alight at Ewha Woman University Station, Green line, Exit 2 or 3 and it brings it straight to the main drag where you can find street food. Hair Salons popular with foreigners are Juno Hair, Cecilia, DJ Hair, and Hair clinic. They are also plenty of woman's fashion here at very reasonable prices. One particular shop that sells cosmetics and a whole array of goods that are popular with tourists is Baviphat. They do instant tax refund (cash) on the spot, if you bring your passport along. Even without the tax refund, their prices are much cheaper than Myeongdong & even Namdaemun. If you want to seriously stock up your skincare, cosmetics, and even Korea's famous Honey Butter Almonds, I highly recommend that you hit Baviphat first before shopping in any parts of Seoul !!I finally dyed my hair at DJ Hair Salon (they speak Mandarin more than English). Log on to their free wifi & use the translator to communicate. It was professionally done.  Didn't have time for manicure/pedicure.......", November 2016
58,4.0,Shopping haven for young women,"As it is located near Ewha Women's uni, this area is a shopping haven for young women, although they do have items for men as well.

This place is packed with small shops selling all sorts of cute outfit that is very suitable for young and trendy. If you are looking for office wear or something more formal, then I suggest, giving this place a miss. Afterall, if you wanna look like a student, you will shop at a university town. If you wanna look like an office lady, better off heading to a department store or gangnam/ myeong dong for higher end office wear", October 2016
63,4.0, Evening shopping ,"It is a very interesting place for young ladies as their prices are most reasonable and nice little shops with fashion, accessories  and interesting caps too.

66,4.0,"Awesome shopping,cheaper than Hongdae","I find it cheaper here and has lots of variety in fashion items as compared to Hongdae. There are jackets that cost 10k won but with very nice quality. That's aroung Php450.00. Also, I found items here from 5000-15,000 won which are very cheap and are really nice clothes. There's also a shop here who sells bags at 10k won no matter what the design is. Its synthetic leather but you'll really see how sturdy the material is. Inbought a couple of pants and shorts here and some tops for really cheap amount. If you are a budget traveller, there also street foods and cafes to try at a very affordable price since this is just mear a University. This is really worth the try! One of my favorites!", September 2016
67,4.0,Quick shopping,"If you think Myengdong is too big and takes too much of your time shopping, go to Ewha's Fashion Street. It is not as crowded and Myengdong nor it has as many shops, that just makes you feel lost... Whenever I go to Myengdong I feel lost and I walk all around the same place many times, some of the streets even looks the same with the same shops around the place!! but Ewha is different. It has a few streets that are filled up with different stores/stands. You can easily find what you're looking for and you do not have to spend too much time. Also, there is enough of street food and cafe's where you can rest or meet someone. Other than that, make sure to visit the University campus, especially during Spring. it is BEAUTIFUL.", October 2015
68,3.0,Popular shopping area,"I found the clothing selling here are similar to other shopping area.  However, most important this shopping street is much more peaceful and quiet than other shopping streets in downtown.  I felt comfortable here.

69,4.0,The street you want to visit for women‚Äôs shopping,"My family and I got there by alighting at Ewha Womans University station on Line 2 and then take Exit 2 or Exit 3. We spent about 2 hours here on a sunny weekday late morning and the ladies in my family still couldn‚Äôt get enough of it! They found shopping here to be more fun and enjoyable. The clothing, accessories, shoes, bags and beauty products for women have more variety and some were slightly cheaper than Myeongdeong district. However, the shopping caters more to the fashion of the young women. Unlike Myeongdeong area, there‚Äôs no crowd here and no stalls in the middle of the road, so you feel more relaxed and less constrained in your movement. With the huge popularity of recently ended ‚ÄòDescendants of the Sun‚Äô TV drama, several shops put up a poster of the actor Song Joong Ki, hoping to entice shoppers like us into the shop. There are also several restaurants and eateries where you could indulge in meal to replenish your lost energy and energise you for further shopping.Aside from shopping, we also walked briefly to the outskirts of the Ewha Womans University that was founded in 1886, admiring the architecture (e.g. imposing church) and the beautifully landscaped gardens. You could actually visit the University campus but we didn‚Äôt. Anyway, we really envied the students for not needing to go far to take a break from their studies since the university is just next to a shopping and eating area.Overall, it‚Äôs a nice experience. And I think it would be even nicer and cooler at night. We would come here again the next time we visit Seoul.", June 2016
70,4.0,Great shopping but be careful!,"Less manic and chaotic than Myeongdong although there isn't quite as much choice (understandably).I strongly recommend you visit a cosmetics store Baviphat that sells numerous Korean cosmetics brands - I've read some reviews/posts suggesting that they sell fakes but the items seemed genuine enough. I am a big fan of a brand Too Cool For School and I got several items from there for 2/3 of the price that I would have paid in a regular TCFS shop. I recommend you have a look in Baviphat before purchasing cosmetics elsewhere. Beware that not all items have testers, but if you get pally with one of the sales assistants, they'll open a sealed item for you to have a look and try. I have 'saved' about KRW 20,000 by buying my Too Cool For School cosmetics here. Also bring your passport to get the items tax free.There are some cutesy shops selling Korean jewellery and many clothes and shoe shops. Most shops don't let you try tops on - it's 'free size' hence you can't try it on. I don't see the logic behind this, I've asked the sales assistant why and even explained that, as a Westerner, I am a different shape and I wasn't even wearing makeup so I wouldn't stain the tops etc but it didn't work. I stumbled across a cute clothes shop called 'Banana +' where I picked up a beautiful embroidered blouse and so inspected it for loose threads etc (KRW 39,000) but as I went to paid for it, the shop assistant didn't let me have that one - she just whisked another one off the shelf (that wasn't on a hanger on display) and put it in the shopping bag. Needless to say, the one she sold me, as I found out once I got back to my hotel, is full of loose threads and a seam is falling apart - check the item before leaving the store as most places don't accept returns.I've spent about 3 hours here and came back a lot poorer but most of the shoes and fashion items sold here are not unique to Ewha - you can see the same items in Hongdae and in numerous underground malls. Still, a successful shopping day and I'm glad my husband decided to stay in the hotel as he would have hated every second of it.", August 2016
71,5.0,Hair salons and cheap food and clothes,I wish I spent more time here. I went to Sinchon for a hair cut at Lucy's Hair and then walked to Ewha. It was busy here especially in the evening. I came across a restaurant for anchovy noodles which was so cheap! Lots of bars and cool stores for young people., August 2016

We managed to visit museum inside the University and stopped at the bakery there. I am amazed with the University buildings and there was a church there too. Due to time limit, we just passed by the fashion street and tried some street food beside the shop lots. If you a korean cosmetic brand lovers, this street has lots of them.", December 2015
75,3.0,Good buys if you are small in size,"The fashion street is near the women's university. There's plenty of cheap buys but don't expect them to be of quality. There are many stores that don't allow you to try. So it's buy first and hope for the best. I found the sizes to run small and extra small so it's quite disappointing. Although they are many stores, they seem to sell very similar things.", July 2016

77,5.0,One of the best shopping spots in Seoul,"I was blown away when I arrived at Ewha Women's University Fashion Street: It was chock full of nice eateries and the best place (in my opinion) to score cheaper than usual skincare products and cosmetics! I stocked up on almost a year's worth of skincare products and cosmetics at Baviphat, which you'll definitely stumble upon while roaming the streets of Ewha; and you should be prepared to spend quite a substantial amount of Won if you plan to do some stocking up too! The price range at Baviphat is well below the prices at the stores eg. Laniege, 3CE, Sulwhasoo, Face Shop.. Just to name a few. Don't miss out on exploring the eateries there as well! And did I mention.. Coffeeshops are everywhere in Seoul, so be sure to leave some space in your tummy for coffee after each meal!", December 2015

82,4.0,"Many stores, but the same products","I used to be an exchange student at Ewha Womans University, so most of the time spent in that area. First weeks, the street amazed me with the stylish, but not expensive clothes, cosmetics and other different girlish staff, however after some time just realize that in every store all the things are the same with the same prices. All the people who were doing shopping at that stores were wearing absolutely similar clothes, the same colors, shoes, bags etc. Make up stores are good, as with that variety it is possible to find what you really need. All the time there are some promotions and quite often you can receive nice gifts for shopping (or just for visiting the store to check out), and the gifts might be not only samples. If you came to Korea for shopping, but are not willing to pay much money, it is place for you! However, I would suggest to find some well-known brands with better quality and different look.There are also many restaraunts with delicious food. The price is comparatively low as it is place mostly for students.", September 2015

Things are very affordable and the designs differ quite abit from each other. There also always seems to be some sale going on at some of these shops. I bought a whole load of clothes and a really smart coat here at a very affordable price. I liked the ambience here ‚Äì it was pretty laid back and although quite crowded, it never really got to very annoying levels. If you are tired from shopping and want a haircut (lol) or a coffee, there are many hair salons and cafes dotted all over the place. This was one of my favourite areas in Seoul and I personally hope that this place never turns into another Dongdaemun or Myeongdong!", April 2016

Food around the vicinity are affordable as well. Probably because cater to the university students. Explore the narrow alley there are several quaint cafes. Coffee, soft serve, waffles etc.Kindly take note shops close at around 10pm or maybe earlier during weekdays. While weekends it depends on certain shop's operating time.

And if you want to take a picture with you're friends or family or your significant other, I recommend you to go to a studio and take it in Ewha Women's University Fashions street (a.k.a Eedae) They have several studio's here and there (I went to a studio that was next to Missha, it's downstairs), and I can guarantee that those photo's will come out beautifully. Also, something you MUST EAT when coming here is Cheese Rice (ÏπòÏ¶à Î∞•), there's one next to a shop called 'piercing crow'. The food there is SO good. Whenever I go here, I always stop by and order a Cheese rice.

One of the plus points about this place is that the products sold here are pretty affordable (with majority of the clientele being students that‚Äôs a given). But while the clothes are affordable, the quality of the cloth is literally what you pay for, so don‚Äôt expect the clothes that you bought to last you a long time (they just aren‚Äôt made that way - well most of them anyways).For more on my experience and photos, please check out my blog: http://www.travelbytez.com/2015/06/a-little-shopping-at-ewha-womens.html", November 2014

The area around Ewha University, however, would really appeal to the young lady on a budget.  Many stall sell 1 dollar socks, 10 dollar tops, 19 dollar shoes as well as 10 dollar bags/backpacks. Just to note here, Le Bunny Bleu (a local shoe design with bunny ears on cute flats/loafers) and Choo Choo Cat (Korea's version of Hello Kitty?) have locations here.  If I were with my sister, we'd definitely spend all day here but as a guy, there isn't much shopping wise BUT the area was still interesting to see as there were lots of cheap eats (I had a tonkatsu/omelette rice for 6.50 dollars).

If you are looking for accessories and fashion, this is the place to be. :-) Of course, it also has the brand name cosmetic stores as well. During our stay there, there were many buses of Chinese tourists in the area. However, I also see local students shopping for trinkets and whatnot. The inner streets have more interesting items than the main streets and is a fraction of the price. For example, the same hair clip that I saw for 25,000 won on the main street costs 5,000 won on the inner streets. :-) Food here is also delicious, but this is coming from a person who loves Korean food in general.

There are also better quality and more fashionable pieces around, but at a hefty price tag. However if you are not planning to shop for cheap clothes there, there are many other things to do and it's a place definitely worth looking around! Go for the various famous brands for skincare and cosmetics like The Face Shop, Etude House etc. Skincare and cosmetic products are so much cheaper in Korea!! Or try shopping for cute and affordable stationeries and accessories in Art Box. Food wise there is Chu's Churros, a caf√© selling very very good churros, or try the street food like the egg bread freshly made on the spot. They also have a unique street food where fried chicken, hashbrown and toboki(korean rice cakes) are all mixed together in sweet sauce and topped with mayonnaise, only 1000won for a small cup(they have different sizes). http://poportion.blogspot.sg/2014/08/flew-from-taiwan-to-korea-on-28th-may.html", June 2014

Not as overwhelming as Myeongdong, but with a great selection.  I always end up coming away with more clothes and bags under 10k won than I bargained for.  There are also some boutiques with better quality clothing, but a still affordable pricetag when compared to other areas in Seoul.The restaurants and cafes with inexpensive food and beverages are a plus, too.

Then I realized that there was a huge fashion street within the women's university itself, how cool is that?There were many tiny boutiques and stalls selling clothes of very unique designs (not found in Singapore, of course), at very affordable range price range.  I found some of the designs a little loud and too funky, but it is all good for the young at hear or youthful individuals.THere are also some skincare range and accessories on sale here, hence one is able to get all their shopping done at this one-stop shopping street.For more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/kaptivating-korea.html", November 2013
138,5.0,A must-go shopping place in Seoul!,"If you have limited days in Seoul and you want to shop to your heart's content without burning your pocket, this is the place you must go! It has fashionable clothes (price as low as 10,000 KRW) and shoes that are cheaper than Dongdaemun, Hongdae and Myeongdong; major Korean cosmetic brands can be found here too! Should you find the price for clothes and shoes too expensive for your liking and yet you would really love to get them, you can try negotiate the price (given that you buy more than one) and add a little aegyo (note: this works!) while you negotiate. I trust that you will succeed 90% of the time (the motto here: be persistent)! ^.^There are many food choices as well ranging from cafe, shaven ice, Isaac Toast to traditional korean food like budae jjigae, jeon etc. I stayed at 24guesthouse at the same area and out of my 6 days trip in Seoul, 3 days were spent at the Ewha's shopping area. It is just too tempting to stay at close proximity to such fabulous place! Do note that most shops here do not open until 11:00am (KST) so preferably a good time to shop will be afternoon till night.", July 2014

143,4.0,"Pretty as a picture, easy on the wallet.","Went there when the weather was nice and cool, lots of shops selling stationary materials as well as clothes and makeup. Lots of those food carts as well, food is cheaper around this area, the clothes and shoes are not bad. Latest trends could be found here. You definitely have to visit the campus itself. Stunning flowers/ views. Great place to relax and be at awe of their gardens. Anyone can enter the campus by the way. However if pressed for time, there is no need to visit this place, as most of the items sold around this area could be located in places such as myeong dong, or dong dae mun. If fond of gardens and architecture, Ewha Uni is a definite place to visit.", May 2014
