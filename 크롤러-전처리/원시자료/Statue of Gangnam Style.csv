0,4.0,Oppa Gangnam Style,"We went there riding through subway and we got off at Gangnam station thinking it was the right stop. If you want to visit this place, ride the subway and stop at Samseoung station - the Coex Mall. This is the spot where the Statue of Gangnam is found. Alighting from the subway,", February 2020
1,5.0,A Pair of Giant Hands.,Not too much elaborate about this. The giant hands are pretty and well made. You can just pose in front of it and that's it. It is right outside the Starfield Library. It is worth to take a picture of these hands if you are nearby. Otherwise is really not worthy of you commuting on train to see them. That's all it is not a must see., January 2020
2,3.0,"Wrong place, wrong shape","Local people who know the history don't like it since its construction process was controversial.When I watched it for the first time on TV, I thought it was in somewhere near Gangnam Station which is much closer to the feeling of Gangnam style. But, it's actually locating in the middle of the square before COEX.I haven't seen many people around. Foreign visitors liked it anyway.", January 2020
3,5.0,All style,The statue is by the road outside COEX. We were surprised that there were so few people. Maybe Psy has gone out of style..., December 2019
4,3.0,It's a statue of crossed arms that is titled Gangnam style.,"If you're at the giant Mall in Seoul and you kind of liked the song Gangnam style by Pay, then you may as well take a few minutes off of shopping to see the statue.  I would definitely not go out of my way to see it.", November 2019
5,3.0,Good only if you are passing by,"it is nice to see only if you are passing by for any reason, it is not worth to organize or deviate your tour for this. it si simply a statue in remember of this success, nothing more nothing less.", October 2019
6,3.0,"It is not a statue, it is decoration","First of all, you don't need to book a tour to see this. It is not an attraction it is decoration outside a shopping center. Take the number 2 line do not exit in Gangnam Station, exit in Samseong Station, 3 stations before or after depending on which way you are coming from. The station is under the COEX Convention Center shopping center but go out to the street and walk around the sidewalk. You will find it near the east entrance, take photos for 10 minutes and unless you want to go inside and shop in an ""almost american"" mall, you will get back in the subway and go somewhere else. Like the Banpo Bridge after 8pm.", October 2019
7,4.0,Must to see it just for fun,A trendy landmark of seoul that if you have enough time you must visit it... not only because it has fun but also of the great interest of the area.. with nice skyscrapers and mall and a special museum dedicated to the modern design, September 2019
8,3.0,Famous dance statue for phito,"Since we are here at Coex centre, we just drop by to take photo of this Gangnam style horse dance statue. Though simple, it is very well done and beautiful.", September 2019
9,4.0,Didn’t realise what they were!,Totally didn’t get what they were until I saw on trip advisor! Right next to the COEX! love that they have a little statue decided to Gangnam style., June 2019
10,5.0,Great place for sightseeing,A great place to go to in the Gangnam District. We had to take pictures in front of the statue and it’s quite iconic of the K-Pop culture., April 2019
11,5.0,Nice to see,If you wanna see the huge hands forming the famous dance of the Gangnam style music video go outside the Starfield Library (mall). You also can watch the video again., March 2019

13,5.0,This was so much fun,"We were so happy to find this, they even have the youtube track that you can play and dance along! Great statue and tribute.", January 2019
14,3.0,Why not?,Not much to see but visit if you're at the COEX mall - take one of the East exits of the mall. Saw quite a few people having a little dance and photo ops and we couldn't resist ourselves! It's lit up at night too., November 2018
15,3.0,Ok,It's kinda cool to see the statue and take pics. That's really about it but the location is next to the COEX so it's worth a visit so you can do great shopping after you do the horse dance., November 2018
16,4.0,Gangnam Style Monument,"The statue is in the front of the COEX East Gate and represents two overlapping fists, the popular “horse-riding” dance move from PSY’s song “Gangnam Style”. From a bird’s-eye view, it looks like two hands embracing the Earth.", October 2018
17,3.0,If you are nearby,It is an impressive statue but wouldn't be too disappointed if a visit doesn't make the top of your list - as I was in the Gagnam area I made a quick stop by for the obligatory photo opportunity - near the COEX mall which is more the reason I was there, August 2018
18,2.0,Can be Missed,I just happened to visit as I was at the nearby Coex Mall but it is hardly a place to specially come to .However the statue has a running video beside to make you dance Gangnam Style steps in case you have missed them .Fun place nevertheless for the family  and young ones make the most of it, March 2018
19,2.0,Nothing here,I went here because the hype at that time. And actually it's just a statue with Psy there and that's it. Is it probably because I'm coming on afternoon?, May 2017
