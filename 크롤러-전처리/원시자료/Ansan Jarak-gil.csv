0,5.0,Weekly trail hike,"I love being out there especially in the crips morning, maybe mostly to avoid a lot of other people.   It is also quite interesting to walk on elevated wooden roadways.   The signs say it will take between 2-3 hours you can easily do it under 2 hours I believe. ", October 2019
1,3.0,Short but steep,"Shorter than many other trails in Seoul mountains, Ansan is beautiful but steep, especially the northern end.", April 2019
2,5.0,A bit tough to reach the trail start,"The amazing trail on high areas of Ansan Mountain. Good to walk around for 2~3 hours feeling the forest and views.- The mountainous zone of Ansan-Inwangsan-Bugaksan is dividing northern and middle areas of Seoul. Ansan is the one on the west.- We started from Muakjae Sky Bridge which is about 20~30 min walk from Seodaemun Prison. Since this trail is locating on a high area, the way to starting point might be a bit tough for seniors.- The whole trail is very long. I think it'll take 3+ hours to complete. But, there are many points to stop and leave.- There are many resting areas and benches. We saw many seniors passing.- It is said this is very beautiful during cherry blossoms in April.", September 2019
3,5.0,My weekly outdoor exercise,The Jarak-gil trail of Ansan is a very well developed fairly easy trail to hike. It is crowded on the weekends but less so than some other mountains such as Bukhansan (also worth hiking but on a less crowded weekday). I recommend going off the trail to really explore the mountain places such as Beacon hill and the water wheel the first time you hike Ansan. When the sky is clear you can get some awesome views of the different parts of Seoul. It is also worth exploring Bongwonsa Temple and Independence Park at the base of the mountain., June 2019
4,5.0,Climb to the top!,"I went to this mountain with my husband on a Sunday morning with the plan to have a relaxing walk along the Ansan Jarak-gil. This wooden path is a loop around the mountain, designed for strollers and wheelchairs. But once there we decided to go up to the Fire Beacon on the top of the mountain. The climb to the top was a bit challenging at some places but the views along the way and from the top were definitely worth the climb!", May 2019
5,5.0,Great nature park. Wide range of terrain for a smallish park,"Totally enjoyed myself here. I like hiking, but have little opportunity to do so. Came here with no expectations except a 4.6 out of 5 rating on google. Totally satisfied.The park centres around a peak of approx 280-290m height. most trails are under the shade of trees, which is great for hotter weather. The trails which go around the park are mostly concrete, and have a meandering gentle up and down. Trails which start heading uphill can get steeper, are a mix of concrete steps, dirt inclines, stone steps. Towards the peak, you have to scramble up some rocks and some ropes as railings.You can get a great view of Seoul and soem surrounding peaks from Ansan Jarak-gil. Can also get some relief from the city noises like cars as well.  On the Thursday I went, there were many people. I'd say about 75% were 50-80yo .There are a lot of features in the park. There are some pagodas with older Chinese/Korean style roofs. Several areas have parks with exercising apparatus like chin up bars, benches for sit ups, and even multiple weight machines that you see in gyms that you can pull out pins to choose different weights. In addition, there are some water springs, which have water running out of a hose (ok...they could simply be piped water running out of a hose, but they call it a spring, ) from which you can drink by using the ladels in the area, or, refill your water bottle like I did. I liked the park. The peak had good views, but wasn't too tall for me. You had many options for trails.it was very well signed, with directions not only showing what was where, but the distance in metres, including nearest train stations. There were 3 train stations, I think. When I returned home, I went on instagram to search this park- a few had pics from winter, and everything was covered in snow- it looked beautiful. I'd love to see this park in the winter as well one day.", May 2019
6,5.0,Hidden nature treat! ,"This is a recommended site for those who have perhaps been to Seoul a few times and feel like they have seen a lot of the tourist sights that the city has to offer. For a change we decided to stay at the nearby Hilton Grand hotel and we came across this hidden gem of a hike route. The route can be accessed on several sites around the hill itself and is very well sign posted, look for any signs to Ansan Jarak-Gil as per one of the photos attached here. It is a short walk from the Hilton and from several underground stations. It was absolutely the best way for a regular Seoul visitor to spend half a day out of the city. The walk provides a nice way to see a bit of 'urban nature' and get some exercise. We did this walk on a hot September day and were pleased to find that parts of the walk were in the shade under the canopy of the trees. We were the only westerners on the walk that we saw that day, but with it being a Sunday it was quite clearly a popular way to spend the day for the local Koreans. Most of the walk is actually not on the hillside itself but on built decking (see picture) that makes the walk very easy as there are very few steps to navigate. Having said that, some of the walk on the decked route can be very steep so do expect to break a sweat! Very much a recommended alternative to the usual Seoul sights.", September 2018
7,4.0,Hiking trail suitable for all,"Ansan Jarak-gil is a 7 kms circular walking trail located in Seodaemun-gu, the path was designed and created in 2013 suitable for strollers, wheelchairs, senior citizens, pregnant women and children.  The path takes you on a gentle slope, through forest and with good views of the city of Seoul.  We noticed an information board and map about the trail in Seodaemun Independence Park, the closest subway station is Dongnimmum (exit #5).", April 2018
