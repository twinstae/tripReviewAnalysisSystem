6,5.0,Beautiful Place in autumn! Hike up then take the cable car down at night!,, January 2019
7,5.0,A haven in the fall!,"I walked from the cathedral uphill to Namsan Park and negotiated the ridge walk and N. Seoul Tower walk. Although steep with many stairs in places, the pace was perfect for absorbing nature. The birdlife and flora was a real pleasure to experience. The vistas from various hills were breathtaking. It was hot work walking, but chilly when at a standstill. Take a jacket and hat! The tower amenities were pure tat. Typical tourist attractions and gifts were jammed into a small area near the tower. The restaurant options were adequate, but the prices high. The views were amazing and the exercise value priceless. Lunch in the tower was about $30 pp, but other level eateries were less by descent. The pigeons fly around in large numbers and are quite fearless around humans, which provides a relaxing distraction. The cable car, buses and taxis are available for a fee, but walking is free and quick. The views on the descent are even better than the ascent!", November 2019
8,4.0,Spectacular views of the city,A huge “park” but really it’s the whole mountain!  There’s paved sidewalks for pedestrians who wish to walk up/down as well as well travelled trails for those who want more of a hike on either sloped or flat terrain. Facilities are available at the peak upon your arrival by foot or motor vehicle (ie tour buses as well as city buses). Cable car is another option. Lots of cyclists also enjoy this park. Go for it!, November 2019
9,3.0,Only reviewing the park,"So I will exclude the tower which I reviewed separately.  As a park, it was a nice walk up the beautifully paved road to the top with the fall foliage in full force.  There wasn't a lot of green and not a lot in the way of single track trails.  It's mostly road or paved path walking although we did go off pavement and followed a storm channel for a bit.  Obviously, it is quite hilly so those who are not physically fit may want to ride the cable car up and possibly walk down... the well maintained flag stone super wide path with steps is a safe and popular option which takes you down beside the cable car as opposed to the road which goes down another side.  Not a stunning park but pleasant.  3 stars.", November 2019
10,5.0,Relaxing green oasis with stunning city views,Park surrounding Seoul tower offering stunning views of Seoul. The walking paths are well maintained. You can take the cable car to the tower but I would recommend walking. The cable car is closed every Monday until 1 PM for routine maintenance., November 2019
11,5.0,Breath taking view!,Include in your itinerary a visit to the view deck of Namsan Mountain. Tip: ride the cable car to and fro or simply walk when you go back. The mountain isn’t that high and steep anyway. More like a hill. You will love the panoramic view of the skyline and sunset. Restaurant price is on the higher side here though., September 2019

17,5.0,Great place for run,"We went there to run, after eating and drinking, we decided to take a lap on Namsan Park, and I love it. We manage to get around 10 km of running with hilly countour. The track itself is road and somesort of rubber in certain area. They have public restroom in the areas around the park and it's very clean. All in all it's a great place to work up some sweat after eating and drinking the night before.", November 2019
18,5.0,if you want to see the view,Nice place to see the whole of Seoul! The cable car ride is nice but the tower view is amazing! Might seem odd but do go to the toilet when you are up in the tower - doing your business with a view sounds weird but its a new experience!!, October 2019

20,4.0,Great run to blow out the boozy cobwebs,"Short trip to Seoul which left me little time to get out and see what the city and capital of the country had to offer - outside of the bars and restaurants. Had a few hours to spare on the last day before the flight home and decided to make the most of a run to the Namsam Tower through the park. Nice gardens, lots of walkers, cyclists and the odd runner forcing themselves up those steep hills to witness the fantastic views at the top.", May 2019
21,5.0,Chance to put city in perspective,Well maintained paths/stairs/roads up the city mountain in Jongno/City Hall area.  Can make the hike up more vigorous by taking the stairs.  Nice overlooks of the city.  Seems to be well used but didn’t feel too crowded.  Seemed to be a bus option up to the top for those who just want to see a 360 degree view of Seoul’s sprawl., September 2019

25,2.0,Not worth the effort of getting here!,"At the time of our visit it resembled a building site with much of the area fenced off for renovation. Billed as a Hanok  Village : village it's certainly not, but just a collection of 5  Hanok style houses assembled from elsewhere!  They are all rather similar and  quite dreary!", August 2019
26,5.0,Next to the tower,"The park is connected to namsan tower. You can take the cable car to reach the park or you can take the long stairs way, about 1 km of stairs.

31,5.0,Good views,"Namsan Park is located around Namsan Hill, which overlooks Seoul and gives very good views of the city. The walk up is straightforward and not too steep, with most of the walk in the trees in shade. Along theay are a variety of viewing spots. At the top is North Seoul Tower, which can be visited, but the views are good enough without paying to go up the tower. A good half day outing.", July 2019
32,4.0,Way to N Seoul Tower,"Namsan park has got the ropeway that will lead you to the N Seoul Tower. While on the Ropeway, you can see a bird eye view of Seoul. The both way ropeway journey cost around 9000 KRW.", July 2019

34,5.0,Great walk!,"I got by myself, on foot, to the top platform. There are many interesting views along the way. It is better to start one hour before sunset to make both day and night photos. On the upper platform there are many cafes, gift shops, a cosmetics store.", July 2019

36,3.0,Good to burn calories ,"Wasn’t overly impressed with the Namsan Park plus it was brutally hot and humid this day. The views are like any other city highest point views.

37,4.0,Largest park in Seoul,"It is the largest park in Seoul and is well-known for its beautiful walking trails. Most visitors come to Namsan Park to enjoy the views, the nature or go for a hike.

41,5.0,"A good mix of nature, history and commerce","The walk up the mountain is not very difficult, and can be completed in about 30 minutes if you walk at a good pace and choose the right path. We went up in a path along the Seoul city wall, starting near Namdaemun Market. A refreshing breeze followed us to the top on that day. We passed by statues of Korean leaders, an office building (with vending machines outside), an exercise area (with bathrooms nearby), a photo island (for photos of the city and geo-reference), and a covered rest pavillion, before getting to the Cable car entrance near the top of the mountain (with vending machines outside). Most of the walk is on paved terrain and there are lots of stairs. But the view from the top is amazing, and there are a lot of fun activities and food that can be tried once you get there. If you want to climb it early, keep in mind that the stores (or the tower) are not open until 9 AM or later. Aside from the restocking trucks and maintenance personnel however, the early hours afford more space and time to enjoy the mountain to yourself.", June 2019

44,4.0,Cable car,The park surrounds the Seoul Tower. We got a cable car up to the top but apparently the walk is nice and quite easy (to me it looked steep though).

47,4.0,Love Locks and Views of Seoul,, June 2019
48,3.0,Night view is good,Went there by the cable car. The cable car is small and stuffy. Walking is better if you have the strength as the walk is steep and uphill. It's a one time visit since it overlooks the whole city. The night view is better in comparison to the day view as Seoul can be cloudy at times., May 2019
49,4.0,Nice view from the park,"We went up by cable car and enjoyed the view on the city from the park. We didn't go up the tower, as it was hazy (as always).", May 2019
50,5.0,Fabulous views from the peak and plenty of walking trails to get away from the crowds,"I was fortunate to visit Namsan Park on a gloriously clear day. The views of Seoul from the peak are fabulous, but if the weather was bad I doubt you'd see much. Took the Metro and then caught a bus up the mountain - otherwise it would be a very long walk to the top. Alternatively, you could take the cable car, but I was on a budget. At the peak there is the usual collection of over-priced eating places, so either take your own food, or eat when you get back down the mountain. On a hot day you'll need plenty of water if you plan walking the many trails that criss-cross the mountain. Great place to visit to see the native vegetation and experience the calming environment on the walking trails, where you won't encounter too many other people.", May 2019

Fortunately since it’s just 5min walk from our hotel and we come early and we avoided the busy atmosphere.. It was peaceful and quiet until after 30 min when the buses from other tours arrived. You have to come early if you want to feel the place. Going back to the cable car, we wear the traditional korean costume for free in front of the mini stone tower monuments (between 11am to 12noon) and take photo with the guards. This is highly recommended for family tour.", April 2019

63,5.0,Nice place,Namsan Park is where the Seoul Tower is located. The experience started with the cable car ride. The added perks were the offering of free wearing of the Korean National costume and the photo opportunities. Also on this park is the Hello Kitty Island where you can find the Hello Kitty Museum and house. Love locks can be found on an area and also the magnificent view of Seoul from above.

76,3.0,Great view but a tad inconvenient.,"We went at night and the view was amazing. You get a 360 degree view of Seoul. A bit touristy as you can imagine, and steps. Even though the cable car says it is wheelchair accessible, once you get to the top there is nothing but stairs. Having climbed the stairs, and there were still many, I saw that you can catch a bus to the top. However there are still stairs and the wheelchair accessibility is still tricky. They are very friendly and accommodating though so while tricky is possible. Also I was not in a wheelchair, just have arthritic knees.", February 2019
77,5.0,Beautiful!,"Be there by 4:30PM, if you want to see the day view, catch the sunset, and see the night view of the Namsan Seoul Tower.

Was interesting to see the tower, although we didn't go up as the view from the top of the park was sufficient for us.

138,5.0,Must do,"Very good facilities. The cable car is a short ride and only about $10 which is very reasonable.Then there is the tower. This is another ticket but worth it, and the view over seoul is great. There is a craze for putting up 'love' locks around all the fences similar to the bridge in Paris.

143,4.0,Try to visit the whole park and in both day and night,I visited this park 3 times during my August visit. I suggest starting from one end and walking to the tower (it takes 40 minutes from Seoul Station) and then exiting the park via the MUCH less crowded eastern end. The east part is much less crowded and allows you to see another portion of the wall and nice scenery as well. It is much busier to visit here at night (avoid weekends) but something you should do at least once for the good view. There is a bus but I find walking much more rewarding., August 2018

The place is an easy hike up through various trails, but if you are not up to hiking up (easy and paved steps/trails), then you can take the tram up to the top and walk down. I would imagine, the leaves are turning colors now, which would be nice. I plan to do the hike (which I've done multiple times) when I visit Seoul in a few weeks.", August 2018

If you don't feel to go up, you can explore the area under the tower. The park is also undoubtedly beautiful.", July 2018
158,5.0,Take the stroll up,Enjoy the 30 mins stroll up the to namsan park. You will feel that its all worth it and make the the securing of the lock even more meaningful.

178,4.0,Long way to get to the top!,"Me and my parents took the gondola ride to get to North Seoul Tower from Namsan Park.  Not plenty of parking spots though. If you're looking for parking, go to the science hall a little further up the hill.  And there was a loong line of people trying to ride the gondola so make sure you wear comfortable shoes and clothing. Worth the wait though!", June 2018
179,4.0,Adventure to the Top,I've been here twice so far. Once by foot following the trail to get to the N Seoul Tower and the second time to try out the cable car ride.

183,4.0,Must visit in Seoul,Perhaps the most accessible place in Seoul to get a view of the city. We visited 2 years ago and went back again this time with kdrama Korean Odyssey at the back of our mind lol....Both times we took the cable car up from Myeongdong and walked down. As we were heading down somewhere else this time though the maps in the park weren't very clear so we spent quite alot of time doing a roundabout walk to get to where we needed to be. The views at the base of Namsan tower are good so we have never bothered with the tower. There are many tourists so it's really busy. I was glad we managed to see the rebuilt Joseon era fire beacon signals and there were some people dressed in historic costumes as part of the experience. As it was our wedding anniversary we also did the cheesy love lock thing though we used our own lock as the locks sold in the machines and shops there are way overpriced - would advise couples to come armed with your own!! A must-visit when in Seoul and the park offers good walking routes if you know where you are going!!, July 2018
184,5.0,Nice place,"It will be good to see the N Seoul Tower, near Myeongdong Cathedral. I suggest that you get a two way cable car ticket. The place is romantic. You may use the elevator going down. If you ll go to Myeongdong, walk to the bus stop and its just one ride.", June 2018

Initial plan was to take a bus up to Namsan Tower but since we were early, we decided to hike up. Honestly, not an easy hike as there were some steep slopes. We weren’t dressed in sports attire and felt that it would have been more comfortable to dress lighter since it was summer in June. But the hike up and view was nonetheless great.
