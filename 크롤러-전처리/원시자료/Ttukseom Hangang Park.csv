It has several facilities to chill.- The resting area below Cheongdamdaegyo Bridge is cool and good to stay during summer.- There are snack stands, restaurants, bicycle rentals and some other things to enjoy.

4,5.0,A break from the rush,"A must if you're in Seoul! Especially if it's hot outside, the Han river is really cooling and beautiful during a hot summer day.

7,3.0,Snow Tubing Experience.,"We didn't get the chance to ski when we went to Alpensia Resort in Pyeongchang so we looked for a resort in Seoul where we could experience snow tubing or sledding. And luckily we found Ttukseom Hangang Park & Resort.We arrived early and the place was practically empty. Even the other attractions are still closed. But at least the snow tubing is already open. Entrance is cheap and you can slide again and again. You get your own tube ring, go up the hill, sit on the tube and slide down the snow. It was fun but scary at first. But you would want to do it over and over again. No need to far. This place is but the right one for the experience.", February 2017

9,5.0,Peaceful and Relaxing Park,"My friend and I love to come to this park for cycling and picnic. The area is really peaceful and less crowded compared to other parks and there's also nice cycling track along the river which is really awesome.Park is very easy to reach by train as the station connects directly to the entrance of the park and the place is huge, so you can spend the whole day to explore and have fun at your own pace with a beautiful han river view.", May 2016
10,4.0,Great place to relax,"This park has many things to offer. You can play basketball, go water skiing, have a picnic, or just enjoy the scenery. You can get a nice view of the 63 Building to the west, a view of the new Lotte World Tower building to the east, and a view of Jamsil Stadium across the river. The only things lacking are venues to eat at. You only have two options: a convenience store or a chicken and beer restaurant in a ship on the river.", July 2015
