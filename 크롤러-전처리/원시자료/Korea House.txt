0,5.0,Great evening out (Dinner + Show),"I went to Korea House several times with my clients on business trips. The reception team has been always very professional and friendly. Set in an historical building, the Korea House is serving an extensive set menu made of several dishes and kimchi (make sure you are hungry", April 2019

2,5.0,Amazing Koreans show,, October 2019
3,4.0,Cultural show was impressive,"The group I was with booked a dinner and cultural show at the Korea House. I had no real expectations but was pleasantly surprised at the cultural show.  The show gave you a good insight into traditional Korean dance, music, and dress - very impressive.  The dinner was a buffet.  You could get almost any type of Korean dish you would expect.  Service and food was very good.  Staff was pleasant and friendly, especially considering I went with a very large group.  I would recommend this as a place to visit if you are in Seoul for a couple of days.", October 2019
4,1.0,Terrible service,"We request to book a table for dinner uso y their website twice, but not response. You can check the confirmation using their site; but is always as “checking” .... they dont even bother to inform you that is full.", July 2019
5,5.0,"Food is good, but it’s really about the show!","I had ZERO expectations for this as a cultural show isn’t usually up my alley but someone else on our trip booked this and it ended up being a highlight from our trip. The dinner is a multi-course affair and is based on royal meals of the past. There are 3 options, and they all come with plenty of food in tasting portion sizes. It’s not your typical Korean meal that you will find in the U.S. or even most Seoul restaurants, but it was all fine. The real treat was the 1-hour long show. The story is based on a Korean folk tale and is performed by a talented group of dancers and other performers. There are also musicians that play traditional instruments to accompany the performance. Without spoiling too much, there was also a fun audience participation element that was a nice surprise. In the end, it ended up being an entertaining way to see a little bit of Korean cultural history.", June 2019
6,4.0,Korean Showcase,"Every time I travel with my wife we always spend one night watching cultural shows that represent the culture of the country we are visiting. In Seoul I think Korea House is the place. They offer different ticket options, like show and dinner, and dinner itself has different options, depending on the food you want to eat, or the kind of service you want to have, etc.... The show is a total representation of the old Korean cultures as shown through the evolution of their music and dance. The food...I don’t really like the food, but it’s worth it if you want to try culturally or historically sourced food, and the servers are wearing period Korean attires.", June 2018
7,5.0,"Banquet.  Many courses, excellent food and service.",This is the second time I have eaten here.  There were 21 of us and everyone felt it to have been very good.  can't fault ti really.

8,5.0,Really great show,"I have seen thus show last month, and i think it is beautiful, elegant, highly professional , done in good taste. Go and enjoy!", April 2019
9,5.0,Excellent!  Must see,I went there with my group and we had dinner followed by the show.  It was AWESOME!  The food was fantastic and very refined and the show was a must-see.  You don't have to understand Korean as there is a narration and the action in itself was hilarious.  We had great fun and I would definitely go again if there is an opportunity to do so., March 2019
10,5.0,Performance only,We did not eat at Korea House. The performance was excellent. They engaged the audience and provided an interesting story., May 2018
11,5.0,Great food and show,"It was a fabulous experience.   Our driver and guide, Paul, were very good.  Paul was very knowledgeable about the city and very polite, funny, and caring.  The dinner was great, and the show was fantastic,  although the sound was loud.  Overall the experience was very good.", April 2019
12,5.0,The coolest lunch experience I had!,"We went for a traditional meal, we didn't see the show. We initially balked at the price, but we got the mid-priced option and it was enough food. The meal was one of the best I had on the trip, and it makes for a very photogenic spread. For our weekday lunch, we were one of three total groups, and really appreciated a lot of the traditional touches (like taking off your shoes and wearing slippers to walk to the dining table. The food was excellent as well, very fresh and unique flavors. We wanted to go back for the show, but it didn't work out for our trip.", February 2019

14,2.0,Overpriced food and ok performance,, November 2018
15,5.0,Lovely Dinner and a Show,"This was a graceful place, so dress nicely (Sunday best / business casual). Dinner was multiple courses -- you choose how many courses ($60 - $135 per person - read the website menu). The dinner menu described in English what each item was. Lots of small tasty bites. Be sure you wear nice socks - you must take off your shoes before you enter the dining room for dinner! The show took place in a small, beautiful theater after dinner. The one we saw enacted the story of an old Korean folk tale ""Sim Cheong"". The acting was lively ,sometimes comedic and the drumming on stage was dramatic.  Other musicians on the sides were playing classic Korean instruments. The costumes and dance were amazing. We enjoyed everything immensely and were lucky enough to have someone else paying the bill.", April 2018
16,2.0,Good show but annoying tourists,"We went to see a show here, without the dinner. The place is really beautiful. However they allow cellphone use during the performance, so as the show was starting, everyone of the tourists in front of us took out their phone and they were recording it all and taking pictures all the time, blocking our view with the phones, it was really really annoying, and they kept doing it all the show. The show was really good, good story, everyone can understand it, they don't speak a lot in Korean so you're not missing anything. It was really funny but also really connected to the Korean culture. They have live music with some really cool instruments we don't have here in the West. The show was really worth while but I think the phone thing made us enjoy it much less. If you go I would recommend going to the front row so you don't get the view blocked from the phones.", September 2018

21,4.0,"Amazing Show, Horrible Audience","The show was nothing short of spectacular. My wife and I enjoyed every second of it. However, there were bunch of Chinese business type travelers showed up way late and spoiled the flow of the show. Additionally, they had the balls to walk around the theater with their cellphone flashlights on! So rude and inconsiderate. Once they sat down in the middle of the show while blinding everyone with their stupid flashlights, they began looking at their phone with their bright screens. It seems like everywhere you go in the world, Chinese tourists are rude and inconsiderate. They act as if the rules don't apply to them...", April 2018

28,5.0,Spellbinding,"What an amazing evening!  The whole show transcends the language barrier to deliver an artful mix of technology, dance, comedy, music, and live theatre.   The play was delightful with a feel good ending.  The dinner we had later was very good and the service impeccable.  This was well worth the time and money to see", April 2017
29,5.0,Excellent experience,"We three adults went to Korea House for an evening meal. We choose a set menu and thoroughly enjoyed it. Each course was beautifully presented and the waitresses who were also dressed beautifully in traditional costumes, explained what we were eating and how we should eat the dishes. We found the experience very enjoyable and something very different which we had do done before. The individual dishes are small and delicate however after 10 or so courses we left very satisfied. I see people comment about the food being expensive, however you get what you pay for. if you are looking for beautifully presented food and quality over quantity I would highly recommend this restaurant.", December 2016

34,5.0,Exactly the cultural experience I wanted. ,"I was looking for a Korean tradition that would exposed me to the various forms of Korea performing arts. I found it exactly here at Korea House. This is my friends and I first time in Korea. I booked only the performance a few days before arriving and received a confirmation right the next day. However, I mistaken the day of my reservation and came a day early. The ticketing ladies were so generous to switch my reservation for me. One of them also spoke good English. The performance was for 1 hour and KW50,000 (~$45) and the story line was easy to follow. The performance was a combination of performing arts, live music, and projections. The plot remained relatively simple and as a foreigner language wasn't an issue in following the story. All in all, truly excellent. Highly highly recommended.", November 2016

38,5.0,Imperial Cuisine,, November 2015
39,3.0,Beautiful place but food was bad,"Attended a reception in this place.  It is a beautiful setting with lovely traditional architecture.  I love the courtyard with lanterns.  Unfortunately, the food was mediocre and a lot of the dishes tasted the same.  It was a buffet that night with many dishes but none of them was impressive.  There was no show that night.  I might go back for the show but not the food.", September 2016
40,4.0,A quite stay,"I didn't go there for an event or to taste the food, but simply to walk around at a time where no one was there (read in the morning). It is a wonderful small quiet place and you can enjoy Korean architecture without another 10 cameras being held up to capture the same image. As I visited it near the end of my trip I simply found it a great place to take a break and catch my breath without tourists pushing past me.", July 2016
41,4.0,good quality of korean traditional performances with good food,, August 2016
42,5.0,Loved This Place,"I cannot say enough about our experience.  We were easily able to buy tickets online and pick them up on site.  We were able to walk around a bit before the performance and enjoy the atmosphere.  The traditional performance was beautifully staged, great singing, and lots of humor.  If you want a night out enjoying a traditional performance pick the Korea House.", June 2016

44,5.0,Great show w 10 acts in less an hour - good swing and drums,, May 2016
45,3.0,Great Show but NOT Dinner,"This is an easy place to go to via subway.  Great garden.  Should definitely go for the Show which starts at 630pm for about 1 hour. We had the Royal Traditional Menu and it was a disappointment. We booked 2 so called Royal Traditional Meal from two location so we can compare.  And Korea House was bad in food quality, taste and service (rushed, makes me wonder if Royalty were that rushed in having their meals).  The other place is Seokparang. No show but the food was really good.", December 2015

49,5.0,Traditional Dinner and Performing Art,"Went has a reluctant visitor, the building itself is great and being off the main area make a great change from the usual modern Korean structures.  I was treated to a good traditional meal and then the real surprise....traditional performing art this was excellent especially the drum dance finale.  Go there...", October 2015
50,4.0,An Awesome Dinner at Korea House ,"We did have an awesome dinner at Korea House in terms of yummy food stuff and great services. From the main menu, we did reserve for their well-known royal cuisine, which includes the signature dishes in the restaurant. They all tasted so good that we stopped to eat them up and definitely forgot our muffin top for the whole nite. Please be reminded to make a reservation in advance and enjoy with a nice experience right there", September 2015
51,4.0,True Traditions,"We had a great experience witnessing one of our best friends' wedding held there. Despite being close to the main road, it was very secluded and quiet. The food served was good but I had to point out, because there was another wedding after our friends', it did feel a bit rushed.", September 2015

53,2.0,Half happy half dejected ,"The staff is blank as they can't understand English,  something which should addressed like the other tourist places in Seoul ,  food was very bad and overpriced", September 2015
54,5.0,Don't miss in Seoul,You can taste all of the Korean national food. So delicious and Folk Art Performance was so amazing and interesting., September 2014
55,3.0,Don't Fall Asleep,"The traditional dance and music which greet you at a Korea House performance are professional and beautifully choreographed. But if you have had a good dinner and then go to this performance, it is not difficult to fall asleep, not even the traditional drums will stop you. Thankfully, there is no attempt to drag the audience onto the stage, so you are safe even if you get a seat in the front row.", May 2015
56,2.0,Not so good at all,If you stay close to Myeongdong area it`s worth going there to experience Korean Culture. I advise you not to visit Korea House unless you sleep on money., July 2014
57,2.0,A great deception house,The personnel is cold and gave no explanation. The food was probably one of the worth we had in seoul. And the price was expensive not to say outrageous for the quality. Go there for the shop at the entrance but not for the food., May 2014

61,5.0,Don't miss the traditional performance!,"We went to Korea House for the traditional performance, which offered an hour's worth of beautiful fan dances, intense drumming, musical pieces, singing and even some breakdancing. The show is very professionally done in a beautiful Korean-style theatre, and you can tell the performers are true artists. I was blown away especially by the drumming, which is so fast you can barely see their hands. And of course, they never missed a beat! The tickets are a bit pricey (50,000W), so I recommend becoming a Korean Tourism Organization member so you can access coupons to save 20%. Directions: take line 3 to Chungmuro station, exit 3. You'll come out at a gas station, and Korea House is directly behind.", April 2014
62,5.0,Not to be missed if you want a real cultural experience,"The olace is within easy access to the metro, 5 minutes walk. The dance perfomance was really good and I can't speak highly enough of the performers and thri porfessionalism and deication to their art. The costumes were colorful and awesome. the women were beautiful their smile was more enigmatic than Mona Lisa's. the stage itself was really well set up. unfortutanely it was not well attended and don't understand why? probably they don't use agencies which would swamp the place with noisy tourists? I tookd the buffet dinner afterwards but I hear the banquet would be worthwhile too albeit expensive, You would need at least 3 people for a booking for that THe cost of the bufet was 40000won which was real value for my money seeing I got to tatse so many varieties of traditional Korean Cuisine.", March 2014
63,5.0,Loved the show,"We attended the performance of traditional music and dance and were so pleased with it.  Our boys really enjoyed the drumming in particular (which is really loud in case your child needs advance notice), and they also enjoyed the length of one hour :).  I loved all of it - we attended with my Korean parents who said it was authentic and were quite moved. Great experience!", March 2014
64,5.0,Great dining experience,, March 2014
65,5.0,"Did only the dance/music, no dinner","We first heard about this show while we were on the Seoul City Tour.  Decided to do this on our own by calling Korea House and making reservations.  We did it only for the performance (USD 50) and had dinner on our own.  This is an incredible show displaying amazing talent by various artists.  I would go there again next time I am in Seoul.  Also, do take your camera; you are allowed taking pictures (just no flash); we didn't take ours thinking there won't be any photography allowed.  Also, if you are traveling form Gangnam area in the evening please give yourself over an hour to get there.", October 2013
66,4.0,Join for the Hanstyle program,"we join the handstyle program with a discount rate which is only cost 20k won per person.. the activity which is included in the program is to learn how to make korean food, wearing hanbok, learning Korean words (just how to write your name) and enjoy thier traditional dance/performance.. the experience is pretty good.. whole program is about 3 hours.. love it and it worth to try out.. :D", October 2013
67,2.0,The food was so bad! It is not worth the money you pay!,, September 2013
68,4.0,traditional dance and music,"f you want to experience Korean traditional dance and music at its best go to Korea House. he dancers are lovely, graceful and seem to float weightlessly across the floor. The drum numbers a fabulous. Overall a great performance. I enjoy watching Korean traditional dance on TV but this is light years beyond.", April 2013
69,1.0,Bland food with poor service,"The food was poor, but the performance afterwards was excellent. This may be authentic royal Korean food, but if so I found it to be very bland. One course after another was tasteless, one-dimensional and generally unfulfilling. I was desperate for the kimchi when it finally turned up!! The waitresses could not have served it in a more unenthusiastic, indeed slap-handed manner. Plates were pushed onto the table, soups spilled, and little to no explanation given as to what we were eating nor  how to eat it. Mugunghwa in the nearby Lotte hotel is far superior. A much better bet if you want to try a Korean banquet.", April 2013
70,5.0,"Touristy, but a great experience","We had dinner and watched the show at someone else's treat, so I can't say anything about the cost as I don't know what it was. The dinner was a great experience. Lots of different foods to try, atmosphere was nice. We had two Korean hosts with us so they told us what everything was, otherwise we might not have known half of the foods. Everything was excellent. We stayed for the show, and though it was a bit cheesy at times, it was really fun to watch. The music was loud at times (not sure kids would like this one at all), the dancers were very good. This is not something I would typically enjoy and even less so my husband, but we both left glad that we spent the time there. I would recommend the show.", October 2012
71,5.0,The one place to experience traditional Korean food if your time is limited in Seoul.,Korea House is a restaurant that caters to visitors by offering a somewhat narrated experience to include a full meal with multiple side dishes and a theatrical performance of the key Korean performing art forms such as Salmunori in a idealic setting in the middle of a busy metropolis. Highly recommended if you will only be in Seoul for a very limited time without any chance to explore the back alleys and by ways. Great location and reasonably priced., February 2012
72,5.0,Traditional Korean Wedding Venue & Cultural Centre,My son and his wife were married at this venue on October 12th.  What a wonderful setting for a traditional Korean wedding.  The location was very easy to get to by taxi.  The facilities at the venue were very good and the wedding extremely well organised.  There were also cultural exhibits to look at too and you can book classes to attend to learn how to do traditional things eg make Kimchi. The buffett lunch after the wedding was a very large variety of beautiful Korean food.  The waiters could not do enough for us., October 2012

75,2.0,Tourist Trap Warning!!!,"Ok, this is another tourist  trap.  If you want to have a dinner that beats your local hospital food, this is the place to go.  You can find much better food, at a reasonable price, in almost  any local restaurant in Seoul.  Korean food is fabulous and certainly this is not the best place to experience it.", November 2011
