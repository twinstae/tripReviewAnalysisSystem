0,3.0,Art museum tour,Good for art people.  Too difficult to understand for us.  There are free lockers on first floor to keep a large bag and coat., December 2019
1,3.0,Nicely designed building ,The building and the surrounding are interesting enough to give the museum a try even if the collection/ installations are of unequal interest., November 2019
2,3.0,I’m too old for this,"We visited on a Wednesday.  Not too many people, so we were able to move around freely.  As a Senior, I didn’t have to pay for admission.  However, as a senior I found it difficult to relate to the exhibits in a positive way.I understand that at least some of the exhibits “spoke״to younger people.", October 2019
3,5.0,"Really cool, absorbing, incredible visit","Take subway to Anguk, setting is restful. Museum spreads to outside. Exhibitions, installations are huge, well displayed! I had lovely inexpensive meal at canteen. Then bought lots of gifts in Gallery.  Outdoor have been there longer. Believe there is bus to visit another branch of this esteemed museum?", June 2019
4,4.0,Learnt about contemporary Korean artists,A retrospective about an artist I did not know was very impressive - including the 'painting table' set up. Then I happened to see the artist at a talk about his work. The museum has several larger exhibits running in separate exhibition spaces + a cluster of galleries is nearby for more visits., July 2019
5,4.0,Excellent venue for Modern Art - Worthwhile stop while in Seoul,I was pleasantly surprised at the depth of art at this museum.  Nice space - interesting art - and beautiful space.It seemed like a nice place to go when the weather got dangerously hot in August.  The air conditioning was fabulous - but the art was even better.Nice children area with interactive exhibits and art.  Your kids will love it.One of my pleasant surprises while in Seoul!  Don't hesitate!, August 2019
6,4.0,Useful for general development!,"I was brought up on classical examples of art and painting, so not everything in the exposition was clear to me. But, I think, more progressive young people will be interested in this museum, as an example of the avant-garde trend.", July 2019
7,5.0,Wonderful space,I came here since I was curious to see what is on show. The museum is big and after a while you figure out how to navigate it. Most galleries were open and the exhibitions held there very interesting. Especially the one about Park Seobo! Ticket for anyone above 24 and not yet 65+ is 4000₩, June 2019
8,3.0,"Good venue, but only 3 Galleries open :( - hence, Average.","1 Adult went alone.  It cost Won 4,000 entry, but only 3 of 7 Galleries were open :(  The Duchamp exhibition had just closed :(  However, of those open, I enjoyed them - particulary Zach Blas idea of 'facial masks' to confuse CCTV cameras (good one!!) and Simon Denny to finally explain what Blockchain/Bit Coin technology really is!  I also enjoyed Cao Fei's idea of using an automatic cleaning machine within a restricted platform to demonstrate today's China: rapid economic development yet contain social conflict with generation gap contradictions.  Very good location for walking to historic village nearby (Bukchon Hanok Village) and a lovely Korean restaurant (the man outside wears a Panda outfit!), just beyond Pink Butter café, opposite the national Library/Digital Archive Building.  (Another great peaceful place to study)", April 2019
9,5.0,A quick art run after visiting the Gyeongbokgung Palace,This place offers a relaxing pace of seeing contemporary art works from different artists.It is also not that crowded unlike other museums in Seoul., March 2019
10,5.0,Free,Great space with 6 exhibition halls to go through. Liked all the exhibits (5) open when I was there. Friendly help by all the staff., October 2018
11,4.0,lovely museum,"Realy nice museum which will give you a lot information about Korean art and history up to app. 1910. They have a great app, which you should download before you start your tour", September 2018
12,4.0,Very Interesting displays,this museum is great i went when it was raining and directly at the entrance they had bags for wet umbrellas and free lockers which was great! the exhibits were all very interesting and i got an English listening guide as i was walking around. defiitely worth braving the rain for., December 2017
13,4.0,For the modern art lover.,Are you 65 year of onder the most musea are free.Orherwhise the entreefee is not zo high.The most musea are also culturele centra for learning.This musea is great to see and to visit. Inside is modern art, May 2018
14,4.0,Interesting,"It was an interesting museum. Though, most of the displays were slightly too dark and/or disturbing. It's a really big museum, with modern spaces. The exhibits and exhibition style was interesting too. Their souvenir shop is pretty cool though.", February 2018
15,3.0,Boring ,"It's a big museum but most of the sections are closed or are not opened. There were only 3 areas opened the last time I visited and the entrance fee was $4000 Korean won. There's nothing really much to see, there's also this video showing how 3 women survived during the Korean War, the video itself was boring and the set inside the temporary theatre was really creepy.", February 2018
16,4.0,Interesting though only one gallery open,"Only an audiovisual presentation was available when I visited at basement level.I can not speak Korean but I watched it twice. It was a three concurrent large screen presentation. Famous as a preeminent academic, Professor Joan Kee, Professor of Art at the University of Michigan points out the development of art and its respective time frame. Post war in Korea means post Korean War in 1953. With that in mind, this video looks at the transition from the Japanese occupation through the period of separation to the destruction of the Korean War. It perhaps shares some similarities with the search for identity in Eastern Europe when the wall came down. It describes isolation and separatism. It captures suffering, hardship of war, and the suffering of individuals, innocent civilians whose lives were torn apart by the separation. Just as you may be getting comfortable there is the sound of gunfire. It paints a picture of the shortcomings of war and its destructive elements. Interesting films - and then you go to leave the auditorium and discover this is not fictional because all the clothes of one of the portrayees is on display. How vividly that brings the life of that person to a real witness. More poignant of the hardships she must have endured and suffered. Excellent presentation. Full marks.Whilst your at the museum check out the restaurant - stunning and inexpensive.", March 2018
17,4.0,Temp exhibitions in a Conveniently located museum with nice exhibition spaces,The museum is located near the G palace.It provides 9 exhibition spaces for contemporary art mostly a Korean one. Ch city what is being exhibit but in any case once you are in the area worth a visit., January 2018
18,4.0,"Good Museum, but not that inspiring","Interesting museum, and many of the exhibits were short on inspiration and quite ""average"". However, some were quite interesting conceptually. I would say nothing was absolutely riveting here...", October 2017
19,5.0,excellent museum - would highly recommend visiting,"It was a pleasure to visit this museum. We were an extended family group of 10 and it seems there was something for everyone. we didn't even have time to explore the food options, but thoroughly enjoyed the art and various exhibits. The museum has different areas, floors, exhibit spaces. Grownups and children roamed and found a variety of things that interested them. Will definitely go back next time in Seoul.", December 2017
20,5.0,If You Speak Art.....,"... You don't need an audio guide. There is free admission on the last Wednesday of the month and one exhibit we saw focused on up and coming Korean artists. The exhibit showed the state of mind of Korea right now. It was more insightful than reading a book or talking to Koreans. Evocative and yet not too complex for normal folks. Staff was excellent, kind, and helpful. The only problem we had was finding the front entry door because we had walked north from Insadong. A must see in Seoul!", October 2017
21,4.0,Seoul Modern Art Museum,This museum has interesting collections. Location is easily accessible. In each hall it is possible to find English speaking gentle staff. Also it is possible to find printed information on exhibitions., October 2017
22,4.0,Drop by!,"Spent an hour in this museum after touring Gyeongbokgung -- the exhibits are beautiful! Entrance to the museum was free for those under 24 (even for tourists as long as you have your passport), which I think is a great way to encourage the youth to drop by.I think an hour is a bit too short if you really plan to see and take in all the exhibits. But for those with just a little bit of time to spare, it should be enough.", August 2017
23,5.0,One of many good museums.,I have been to many museums in Seoul now and this is a good one.  Not very big but still good.  And in a very good location next to the most popular place in town and less then 10 minutes walk from the King Sejong and Admiral Yi statues and museums., July 2017
24,5.0,Top-level curation,"This MMCA location showcases Korean art, and they also get high-quality international exhibits.  A slightly awkward building, but that is to quibble.  Absolutely worth a visit if contemporary art speaks to you.", June 2017
25,5.0,Fantastic museum of contemporary art,"Count in spending several hours here to see the huge display if contemporary art, mainly Asian. It is a world class museum. The only drag for non Koreans is that the audio guide has a bit of info on just a few works, and there is minimal English signage otherwise. Still, if you have any interest in contemporary art make sure you come here. Conveniently, the very good Arario Museum in Space, also focused on contemporary art though with a more western orientation and better English signage, is just up the road.", July 2017
26,4.0,Excellent Contemporary Art Museum,"f you like contemporary art this is a ""must see visit"" in Seoul.  Starting with the architecture of the building and the exhibitions rooms everything is great, particularly if you want to have a large vision of contemporary Korean art. The place is really big and consents the presence of very good installations. The museum is located in a nice area, in a cluster of many beautiful and interesting art galleries, cafes and restaurants.", April 2017
27,5.0,Great venue and great exhibitions,Visited on a short trip to Seoul and would come back there.It's a great venue with very cool exhibitions happening., April 2017
28,4.0,Great place to wonder around and get inspiration,quiet and impressive museum with lots oxf Asian artists. Great to walk around for 2 hrs and get some modern inspiration., March 2017
29,5.0,You should not overlook this small little jam!,"This museum is situated in the northern part of Seoul.  The museum is very close to the Kyungbok palace which was the main palace during the last dynasty of Korea.  The museum's construction concept is ""Multiple Islands surrounded by sea (actually developed into small open yards following Korean traditional construction concepts and this open areas are very good space for large sculptures, etc.  The museum's display of modern contemporary arts periodically reorganized and designated inner spaces are decorated by carefully chosen artists supported by large corporations of Korea.   As a local I strongly recommend to visit this place if you have a plan to visit the the main palace area.  There are small but nice Korean traditional food restaurants nearby this museum (also the very children-friendly place).", January 2017
30,3.0,Just don't get modern art,"Only went in as it was free over the CNY holiday. I just don't understand why an empty room is art. Or a room full of clay balls. There are a few pieces that are interesting to look at but for the most of it, if your 5 year old produced it you would be happy, but you would not make a room full of it and call it art.", January 2017
31,4.0,near to Gwanghwamun palace,"came to visit during november 2016cost 4000won each person (~SGD $4.80) to view all the exhibitions in MMCAAs MMCA is near to Gwanghwamun palace, you can pop by if you are keen on arts and you can walk over to Anguk later for your lunchThere are digital lockers (free) which we utilized it to store our bags and autumn jackets while we wonder around MMCAit is interesting to see art pieces by the korean artists. looking at art pieces somewhat help to calm my mind and there is a sense of serenity, i do enjoy being there. i will probably return if there is new exhibitionwe spent about almost 2 hours, taking non-flash pictures of the exhibits (:", November 2016
32,5.0,Good exhibitions,"Good Korean exhibitions, some of them are interactive. A different insight into Korean culture. Close to other tourist attractions.", November 2016
33,5.0,new launch,expanded to new building no huge but well curated  and interesting   Free during thanksgiving weekend . shop good too, September 2016
34,5.0,Fantastic Exhibitions of International artist,Great museum with very large exhibitions of Modern and Contemporary International artists. Great place to see if you like art, October 2015
35,4.0,As the name suggests,"It's a huge space for exhibiting modern and contemporary art mainly. The MMCA Seoul branch offers a spacious courtyard, some gift shops, a theater and a cafeteria among some other shops. The location makes it even more attractive, it's right next to Gyeongbokgung Palace and other main attractions. There's a small admission fee which is totally worth it, considering that they've brought the works of Gilles Barbier, William Kentridge and Leandro Erlich before, just to name a few. Personally, I love the surrounding areas but I find the architecture of the very building somewhat cold and orderly. Interestingly, it used to be the old Defense Security Command building.", August 2016
36,4.0,Some interesting artworks.,"It is questionable whether all the pieces on show are worthy of the name 'Art'. Whilst it begins well by showing how a craft can become an artwork, it seems to develop into a need to fill space with projected images and other video films which are not worthy of the space dedicated to them. Fortunately there is a cafe and cafeteria on site where one can review the different exhibits.", September 2016
37,3.0,"Good souvenir shopping any time, choose your moments for the exhibits","The repurposed ship's hull at the entrance is intriguing and inviting, and the gift shops full of well-designed traditional and modern goods are good hunting ground for souvenirs. But check the current exhibitions carefully before paying to see inside. There is no standing collection and when we went the temporary exhibitions were extremely sparse and underwhelming - just one work worth seeing, and room after corridor after atrium of empty space.", August 2016
38,3.0,Big Empty Space,"This big impressive looking complex is located opposite Gyongbokgung Palace, around the corner from the main entrance.  It seems to be a big white empty space without much in it. We wandered around looking for exhibits but it seemed that most of the galleries were closed so perhaps they were in the process of changing.  Found it difficult to navigate and to work out where to go (even with the map).  We saw a huge installation, by a german artist, of 4 shipping containers frames with fountains coming out that spelled random words (very interesting), a room full of balls of clay on a table and a young architects exhibit (mildly interesting), a few sculptures outside and that was about it.  Just had a coffee and moved on. Plenty of Koreans there with kids running around.  probably just enjoying the airconditioning.", August 2016
39,4.0,A Big Art Gallery,"More than a museum this place looks like a big art gallery. If you like contemporary art, you will find beautiful and stunning works. 1.5 hours to see it all. Cafe for food on site. Open from 10-6pm (tickets will stop selling 1 hour before closing time - Wednesday closing time is after 6pm and admission is free every last Wednesday of the month). 500m walk from Anguk Station Line 3 exit 1. Closed mondays.", July 2016
40,5.0,"Fascinating, captivating, well worth a visit","You never know what to expect with a contemporary art museum. It seems like each one I visit around the world exhibits something completely different from each other one. It's the uniqueness of a museum that makes it stand out from the predictable.There's only two floors to this museum, and it only took an hour to see it all, but I found it to be quite addictive. Rather than spoil it, I'd recommend people just check it out for themselves.The pieces that stood out for me were photos that artists took by examining children's drawings made with crayons and turning them into real-life photographed copies down to each tiny detail to reflect the original drawing, not to mention the fact it was so bizarre and adorable it made me laugh in amazement. I'd never seen anything like it in my life.", July 2016
41,5.0,Impressive,This museum opened in 2013 and is a major asset to Seoul and fits well in to the cultural atmosphere of the Bukchon area. The building complex is large and very easy to find with the entrance opposite the palace. Most of the gallery space is under ground but is large well lit and easy to navigate. The exhibits had ample English to explain their context. With an entrance fee of 400 won this is very good value., July 2016
42,4.0,modern and contemporary art of korea,"This museum was open last year. It is near insadong and samchungdong. If you are interested in modernart, go MMCA. Near MMCA you can see many galleries, so after you see mmca, go sime galleries. Usually it is open until 6. The last entry time is 5 maybe.more information go hompage.", May 2016
43,4.0,OK experience,"The museum has quite a number of spaces for exhibition, but during my visit almost half of the spaces are closed, so there was not a lot to see. They were having photography exhibition by that time and I'm more interested in painting and sculptures so I was a bit disappointed. But it was still a nice place to go if you do not have much to do and want to relax in the afternoon/to visit on rainy days. I wish there will be more spaces opened next time I visit. Also, there are a lot of galleries near the MMCA, so it can be a good idea to visit the galleries around the area.", May 2016
44,5.0,Very Fruitful Visit,"Must visit if you are an art or cultural lover. MMCA is a modern architecture with innovative interior design, which was awarded as ""Architects of the Year"" in Korea, 2014. Also, it is an art, culture & education multi-function complex, consisting of 8 galleries, lecture halls, digital facilities and theater. A wide range of exhibitions have exceeded our expectation, which provided a new art appreciation experience.  You can also enjoy free admission to visit during night opening from 6pm-9pm on Wed/ Sat. Don't miss it!", May 2016
45,3.0,So-so,"The museum building is spacious and fancy, located just outside Gyeongbokgung palace and the folk museum. However, at the time of my visit, only one or two (!) of the eight exhibition galleries were open, so not that much to look at really. Make sure to check in advance before you visit, since it not cleary stated on their website front page which exhibitions that are open. Closed on Mondays and entrance fee for adults is 4000 won.", April 2016
46,5.0,Loved this place!,"Really awesome, affordable museum to wander about. Many different exhibits and installations happening ~ I really enjoyed the William Kentridge exhibit. The museum itself is very modern and open. We went on a holiday when the museum admission was free for everyone. Even though there were A LOT of people there, it did not feel crowded because of the very large, open spaces.", February 2016
47,5.0,Amazing Place!,Didn't even notice when ladies said it's time to close the museum! Spent there whole day without noticing when is it time to eat.  Enjoyed the benefit of free admission for students but had so much fun!, January 2016
48,5.0,Not so well known as it ought to be ...,... possibly because it is very new. The MMCA houses innovative and participative exhibits with some multi-media work too. The best of modern art from Korean and foreign artists., November 2015
49,4.0,Well worth the visit - great,Really enjoyed the internal as well as external art on show here. The varied collection of contemporary pieces were world class., May 2015

51,4.0,MMCA Seoul - An enjoyable modern and contemporary art museum,"The Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (MMCA) includes three branches around Seoul, the main branch being located at the former Defence Security Command building on Samcheong-ro near Gyeongbokgung Palace. Opening Hours 10am to 6pm (T,TH,F,SN) and 10am to 9pm (W,ST), closed on Mondays. Here you will find eight exhibition halls spread over three levels of this large building. Presently there is a large collection of works by Korean contemporary artist Suh Se Ok on display. This is a series of abstract images that represent people. The works are peculiar and interesting to view. You can take photographs as well if you like. We also enjoyed seeing the large installation that dropped water in a sequence and pattern, spelling out various English words and phrases. This was neat, as were some of the works included in the Ahn Kyuchul 'Invisible Land of Love' exhibition. There were some peculiar works in the downstairs exhibition halls as well. We liked the mechanical junk works that moved around on the floor. That certainly had a way of grabbing your attention, regardless of your liking the works or not. Overall, we were quite pleased with our visit to the MMCA Seoul branch. They do a pretty good job of filling the halls with interesting modern and contemporary art that is interesting and fun to look over.  We didn't fall in love with any of the works here but were happy with our visit and would definitely consider a return during future trips to Seoul. Note: Do check out ongoing and future exhibitions on the MMCA website in advance of your visit to Seoul. This can help you determine if the art on display meets your art tastes or not.", November 2015
52,5.0,Another must see near Samcheongdong,"A complex for modern art with a recreated palace within the grounds. It has a good library and at present , an outdoor intallation art to marvel at.", September 2015
53,4.0,Good variety of arts shown,"A nice place to visit, especially the last Wed every month, as it is free only on that day. Got different type of artwork being shown. Though not really understand much about arts, the museum is spacious enough to walk around and enjoy what is offered.", September 2015
54,5.0,"Hands down, excellent. World class.","This museum is right near Gyeonbokgung, near the exit by the folk museum so decided to give it a look and was extremely glad that I did as it turned out to be one of the highlights of Seoul.The curating is excellent and presents a number of Korean artists that showcase a contemporary emotional reflection, a query into identity and what it means to be Korean, the country's rapid development, amongst many other issues. Pieces are powerful and linger with you for a while. I would highly recommend paying this museum a visit and prioritizing it on your to see list. You do not have to be an art lover to visit the museum, pieces are fun, playful, while others make for good photo ops as well. Very child friendly.", September 2015
55,5.0,World class museum,"I have been to a lot of contemporary art museums and this is up there with the best! You won't find the big international stars, but the exhibitions of Korean artists are fantastic. The curators have done a great job here, and again and again you blown away by the displays. Both in size and in magnitude. Well worth a visit, even though you are not an art buff.", September 2015

I've never experienced that my whole life travelling around the world.  Just a bit far to walk. :P", August 2015
58,4.0,Awesome museum,"We'd heard great things about this museum and given that it was a short walk from Gyeongbokgung Palace we decided to stop by. Students were free which was a nice surprise, and we loved the interactive exhibits and installations. A really cool museum - would recommend a visit even if you're not typically a fan of contemporary art.", July 2015
59,5.0,What a museum should be like,"Not being a great fan of modern art, I was pleasantly surprised at this museum.  The exhibits were varied and interesting.  My visit coincided with an exhibit on an imaginary country, Xijing, which was quite superb, and worth the admission money alone.Even if, like me, contemporary art is not quite your thing, this is well worth seeking out.  As it's near the Bukchon village, this would make an excellent half-day visit.", July 2015
60,5.0,YESSSSSSSSS enjoyed very much,I did not intend to go here but after visiting the palace I walked past this and thought to go and have a look . I thoroughly enjoyed it as it gives a great insight into a more modern south Korea. I only had limited time and could easily have spent longer there. Try it., June 2015
61,5.0,A fantastic art space in a wonderful location,"We stumbled upon the Museum almost by chance, when walking from Insadong to the National Folk Museum during our first day in Seoul. It was a fine summer day and we decided to go in and discover it, while we waited for lunch time.If you are a lover of modern art and modern architecture, you will be pleasantly surprised. The building and surrounding areas are magnificent, and it's located right across the street from the National Folk Museum.Most exhibits are large-scale and they may be contemplated (or not, depending on your tastes) at your leisure and without disrupting the traffic flow - the MMCA is very well organized, the staff is pleasant and most exhibits have an index card in English. The restaurant (Caffe Grano) is also very recommended for an Italian lunch. The pizzas and pasta are good and not too expensive for a Museum cafe.We will return to the MMCA on our next visit to Seoul.", June 2015
62,5.0,Great museum of contemporary art,"If you like contemporary art, the sleek looking museum is a great museum. It is an impressive space that is full of large scale exhibits.

It is a nice and relaxing way to spend a day.", July 2014
63,5.0,Pandas,"The main reason why we visited here is because of the 1600 Pandas event. Good thing it was also scheduled when we were in Seoul. Since this is a one time event, the pandas won't be there anymore. Good thing we were able to catch it before it transfers to another city. As for the museum, the place is full of large art pieces.", June 2015
64,4.0,"If you like contemporary art, particularly large scale installations","If you like contemporary art, in particular large scale installation art, then you MUST make it to MMCA.Was here in late May 2015, and experienced Shinji Ohmaki's Liminal Air installation and Leandro Erlich's Port of Reflections. I think they were preparing for new exhibitions at the time of my visit, so it seemed a bit empty and disorganized, but it is nonetheless, an impressive space.The surrounding area is so charming!!! Full of cafes and galleries. Makes for a lovely afternoon out.", May 2015
65,5.0,Special exhibition of Jung Takyoung,"This museum is situated at the end of Deoksugung grounds. In front of the museum building is a fountain in a pond. At the time we visited, there was a special exhibition of  the artist Jung Takyoung. There were sketches and drawings, paintings, handicraft works and abstract paintings.

66,5.0,a must-visit place for art lovers!,"I was really pleased to see that a lot of contemporary works by Korean artist were featured.

67,5.0,Second visit to the BEST museum,"I have visited this museum already twice, and each time I have been absolutely enchanted. The exhibitions and installations are simply remarkable. The works of art are of very high quality, and there are explanations in English. Audio tour is available. My favorite is the “Hanjin Shipping The Box Project” that sponsors and supports artists.I have seen two installations and they were both INCREDBLE. Check the website out to see more .  lovely cafeteria and great gift shops !", March 2015

70,4.0,Great contemporary art,"If you're into art and want a fresh perspective on contemporary works, this is definitely worth checking out. There are some really unique paintings, sculptures, exhibitions, and rooms dedicated to different styles and works of art. Certainly worth checking out for any art lover. I do agree with some of the comments that there could be a bit more, but it's certainly not lacking.", November 2014
71,2.0,Yet another empty box,"After seeing the building work from the outside on my visit to Seoul last year I was looking forward to seeing the finished museum this year.  What a disappointment. After having bought expensive tickets we tried to figure out where the collection was in this labyrinthine building. Well, we came to understand that there is hardly anything there. And what is there is extremely mediocre. Enormous  spaces, huge corridors, elevators and escalators going nowhere.  Glaring white walls. By now everybody knows that that is the worst way to show a painting. Not in Seoul. I suppose that the  builders and bureaucrats made a lot of money on it.As usual. A missed chance to make Seoul a more interesting place to visit. When one wants a bit more out of life then just eating and eating, go somewhere else.", September 2014

The permanent collection is housed at another branch in Gwacheon which is also worth a vistit.  In fact, if you're only going to choose one branch I'd go for Gwacheon.  There is a fee but its fairly modest.  Its a 20min walk from Anguk subwat, opposite the Folk Museum.", August 2014

76,4.0,Great location and collection,"located in the great location surrounded by many museum and palace.The MMCA offer great collection of modern and contemporary art from painting to installation. The collection of Korean Zeitgeiss is ok, not so stunning but still we can experience Korean contemporary art here but not all painting and sculpture is on the english interpretation device but still we can enjoy the art work any way. the variation of sculpture,painting, installation and video is very good, they displayed also the work of Nam Jun Paik in some corridor of the museum. there is museum shop in the corner of the building and also museum cafe that offer some light lunch, cake and coffee.", January 2014
77,3.0,Amazing exhibitions and beautiful building,"Small entry price and great exhibitions, I was very impressed! If you can try buying your entry tickets before to avoid long queues.  As in all Korean life, you will be waiting in long queues to see every exhibit but they are all well worth it! Very well located for lots of other attractions and there's a city tour bus stop outside too.", January 2014
78,5.0,Korean Art is cool.,"Not too many visitors, but a great space to see Art from planet Korea. Have a break from wandering around the Hanuk village, head down towards the palace, and you will find it. Helpful staff, quite a lot of interpretation in English, a fair price - 7000 to see all the bits on display today, and you have a great way to spend a couple of hours.  If you like to go to places where there are more Locals than tourists, interactive exhibits and an atmosphere which suits kids and adults alike, give it a go.", January 2014
79,4.0,Very good modern art museum at a price,"This museum is way more conveniently-located than the Korean National Modern Art Museum, but the entrance costs no less than 7,000 won. I think the collection is excellent although I personally would not normally pay the ticket price to see it. The in-house Italian restaurant looked really attractive and, unusually for Korea, has a nice view, but the prices were themselves well above Seoul's (very cheap) average.", December 2013
80,4.0,A good escape from the metropolis into contemporary art.,Big spaces with big installations. Very interesting the engaged work of Amar Kanwar (dec 2013). Worth spending a couple of hours., December 2013
81,5.0,Interesting complex and great art,"It took some finding, and finding the correct door to enter as the complex is multiple buildings with multiple doors, but they aren't all entrances. Once inside, the ease of flow between galleries and the exhibitions to see were wonderful and even better since we happened to go on the last Wednesday of the month which is the free entrance day... which we hadn't known about. ^^", November 2013
82,5.0,A nice new addition to Seoul's offerings,"We really enjoyed most of the modern art, especially the House in the House, in the House, in the House,.... Children will also enjoy several of the artworks. Of course, like in any modern art museum, you sometimes have the feeling ""so what"" and/or ""I can do that"" (not sure if that is true), but all in all we found the museum a really god one. (We also checked out the new Zarah Hadid building called Plaza but that has not opened yet).", November 2013
