2,4.0,"Expensive, equivalent to Selfridges or Harrods",Huge store with everything high end you need.  Close to the markets and other big shops. We went yesterday it was packed. I thought the staff were quite rude when I asked for a specific product and the information desk was really unhelpful as the guy did not speak one word of English., December 2019
3,5.0,A surprisingly great place for food! ,"The good hall is connected to Hyewha underground and is brilliant! Shopping is very high end. Tax free floors are 8-12 (not very well advertised), but we found it overrated with not much bargains. Also they only accept USD in duty free and you need your passport (or photo of it) and flight details to buy.", November 2019

7,4.0,Typical Upscale Department Store,, November 2018
8,5.0,AMAZING spot if you're into fashion.,"I always laugh when I read reviews from people bashing a high end store for having high end items. If you can't roll with the big boys, stay on the porch. There's everything in here for every type of fashion you could want from minks to street wear. There's also a supermarket, street style food booths and other restaurants in the basement. If you've ever been to Harrod's, that's basically what this is. Well worth a visit if you're into fashion.", July 2019

10,3.0,Mainly high end product shopping,"If you are looking for luxury goods such as cosmetics, perfumes, handbags and clothes, you can come here and buy these products.

11,1.0,Horrendous service at airport duty free pick up,"Firstly, the level of service at the departmental store in Myeongdong wasn’t great. Bought a Tumi hand carry and due to bad command of English of the sales person, I became aware only after payment that I can only collect the bag in the airport. The first payment transaction had to to voided and a new charge had to be processed because the sales person made an error the first time around. Long story short, when I went to collect my bag in the airport on 27 May (approximately 9.30am) the lady that served me was rude beyond explanation. She handed the bag in a box to me and wanted me to sign off that the item was collected in good condition. I refused before inspecting the item. I asked for a cutter or scissors to open up the box, she lamely handed me and pen without uttering a single word. I asked if she expected me to unbox with a pen, she dropped the pen on the table and walked off! Such utter rudeness! If Korea wants to promote tourism, the country need to send its people fronting tourist for better training as such bad attitude in a place filled with tourists is just not acceptable! The picture below showed the unfriendly facial expression of the staff member manning the collection counter. Such a sight just put off the idea of me ever wanting to visit this country ever again. Extremely disappointed and upset with the horrendous encounter. Shinsigae, please send your staff for training so that they are more customer oriented.", May 2019

There are a lot of luxury goods but for Hermès they don’t have bags and only comestics and stuff. It is a lovely mall!

29,5.0,"Go to the bottom, it’s awesome!","This store only carries high end goods, so if you are looking for a deal, this might not be the place for you. It is however extremely nice and everyone was very friendly. The bottom floor is where you need to go. That is where the food court is along with a nice grocery store. The food at the food court is as good as it gets! We had the best rice bowls there. We actually went back multiple times.", July 2018

The employees I found to be very brusque and even surly and unhelpful. Will not go back.", July 2018
37,5.0,Great shopping and excellent service ,"Compared to other high end department stores in the area, we felt more shopaholic here. The staff are friendly, more attentive and more welcoming.

49,5.0,Shopping Heaven for Shopholic!,"This is the place for people like me....shopholic with a style. You can get lots of branded goods at a good price especially at their duty free floors. However, take note that you can only collect the items purchased at the airport upon your departure date.

69,4.0,Lotte Department Store is Better,"This is still a good department store, I just feel that if you got to Lotte Main Department store, I don't see why you'd need to go here.

79,4.0,My wife really loved it here,"It seemed to me like a Macy’s in New York without all of the glittering decorations. he department store had American Music, all of the advertisements had American girls and every store could be found in America. I have some allergies to perfume and this place really had such a strong perfume smell because of all the samples being given out and placed on potential customers. The prices on cosmetics were pretty good according to my wife even though I find the duty free at the airports cheaper. I liked that you can show your passport and get a rebate on the taxes you paid so that was pretty cool except for we were with our in laws and they know how to do that. Had I been by myself there would be no way I could have done that because you have to go across the street then down some escalator to like a secret passage that it wouldn’t be worth my trouble. The place made my wife happy so I’m ok with that.", February 2016

My wife choosed 5 leather handbags went to the cashier to pay and they refused letting her pay without the passport. At the same time all customers pays normally. As tourist we never carry passports while shopping majority of tourists leave passports in hotel room right! My wife showed her official identity card. But still the cashier refused a supervisor came to help but still the cashier lady refused! Can any one tell me what thats means at front of all other customers. The other thing non of them speaks a single word in english., October 2015

91,4.0,Impressive and opulent store,"What an impressive site as you approach Shinsegae.  The main store, the flagship of the chain is truly a landmark in downtown Seoul.  Located in the Myeong-dong area the beautiful structure emits an air of style, class and historic culture.  Best way to reach it is by metro light blue line 4.  Take exit 5 and walk forward.  You will see the beautiful building facing you.  Shinsegae which means ""new world"" is noted for its luxury goods with all brand names represented in the store.  My main reason in visiting was to see what was offered in the basement, usually the spot for food items and supermarket.  Not to be disappointed it was super clean, orderly and well laid out for viewing, shopping and gawking.  The products were of very high caliber as evidenced by the prices.  Does $10.00 for an apple tell you anything.  It really is eye popping to see the array of cooked and packaged goods.  It is mouth watering.  There is a supermarket and also many mini counters selling ever item imaginable.  Some of the bakeries were fabulous.  Even if you are not in the buying mood it is quite an experience to see how the rich shop.  I was somewhat disappointed, because having been in Lotte, this area was much smaller, plus I could not locate a sit down restaurant like in Lotte.  It does not compare to the size and quantity of goods available in Lotte.  It is definitely worth visiting and experiencing it.  But if time is limited, then I would most definitely visit Lotte for the shear size and scope of the area.", June 2014
92,5.0,Hidden Gem in the Hectic & Stressful City Life,"The most luxury department store. Two wings. One wing for super luxury and the other for normal luxury. Worth to visit and see what it offers, but please note you'd feel odd if you are not well presented. Also, please make sure you visit TRINITY GARDEN on the top of department store. My friend took me here for lunch break. I never wanted to disclose this place to anyone as it's just a perfectly hidden gem in the city. Quite classy, stylish lavish cafe with high quality food and beverages to the richer. You'd feel quite odd when you are not presented properly not only in the garden but also in this part of department store. Four major artworks would obviously make you feel privileged as well. Absolutely stunning merchandising and promotional stuff overwhelm you. Very lavish life style for the richer but good to catch up with global trend. Not a place you take your kids. Not a place you'd casually and uninhibitedly visit and enjoy, but obviously much better than any other department stores if you'd like to buy any luxury goods.", April 2014

95,5.0,just wow!,Shinsegae Deptmartment store in Myeongdong might have been the best shopping day i have experienced. Not only because of the endless high end designers but the service of the workers are unbelievable. One worker who works for Dior Sunglasses truly made my shopping experience at Korea one that i would never forget. Not only did she took me by suprised by speaking in English but she might have been the sweetest and nicest person i have ever met. Truly amazing., May 2014
96,5.0,Finest and Best,"Easily the finest and best high street shopping experience in Seoul. Spread across two stores, New building(12 floors) and the main building(6 floors). Has all the major fashion brands under one roof. Truly amazing. As always the duty free floor is flooded with Chinese shoppers. The basement food court is good. The authentic Korean restraurants in 10th floor is very tasty but expensive. Worth visiting for the experience.", February 2014
97,4.0,Upmarket Shopping Centre,Shinsegae Dept Store is one of the upmarket shopping centre in central Seoul.

103,4.0,Good Restaurants Upstairs,"One of the best restaurants in Seoul for kalbi-tang is on the 10th floor.  They have a nice coffee shop on the main shopping floor, you can purchase pastries as well.  You can satisfy your western craving for bread products as well - a couple of good bakeries which sell whole-wheat bread, muesli buns, good selection of imported jams, etc.  Ladies, if you are anything more than a US size 6-8, forget about finding any clothing here that fits.  Go downstairs to the market and you'll have many choices.  I always purchase traditional Korean cookies/sweets for my friend's mother, a Korean lady in her 90s when I am there.  The store itself if spotlessly maintained, and a nice reprieve for a coffee, cake and or bread purchase when you are in the area.", November 2011
104,5.0,Restaurants on the 10F are excellent!,Having family in Seoul is a plus because they know where the high quality but reasonably priced restaurants are.  The 10F of the Shinsegae department store near Namdaemun is one of them.  I have had the occasion to try a few of them but the one that stands out is the sushi restaurant on the 10F--not only will you get fresh and authentic sushi but the price for what you get is outstanding.  There are many choices of cuisines and it's a nice place to take a break between shopping at Namdaemun.  We thoroughly enjoyed our sushi meal and will return for some more when back in Seoul., September 2012
105,3.0,Upmarket mall - very expensive,"Go to this store if you want to purchase high-end fashion and accessories at a high-end price. It is just a huge department store, nothing special, unless you go to the one in Busan in the South of Korea, which is recorded as the World's Biggest Department Store. If you do go there show your foreign ID at the information desk to get a coupon booklet, then purchase any item, even something small from the supermarket and take the docket back to the counter & you will receive a free quality shopping bag. Also a must in this store in Busan is to go to the 9th floor restaurant and eat 'Blowfish' and live to talk about it. Perhaps the store in Seoul gives the bag & has a 'Blowfish' restaurant too, worth it to check, if you are interested!", September 2012

108,4.0,Huge upscale mall,This mall is huge and very upscale.  Take a trip to the bottom level for a snack.  Walking around took forever but the sights were pleasing.  The clothing displays were very nice and I found a dress that's out of this world.  Ca't wait to wear it., May 2012
