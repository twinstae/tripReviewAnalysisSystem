0,4.0,"Small City Palace, Great for Visit if one is short in time",A small palace compared to that of Gyeongbukgung and Changdeokgung. This palace is perfect for those who wanted to visit one but do not have much time. The palace allows visitors to understand the ancient Korean culture. There is a change of guard ceremony at fixed timings here., November 2019
1,5.0,My favorite Palace,"This is probably one of my most favorite Palace in Seoul, definitely in the top three. It seems like it lies in the center of Seoul the way it is positioned surrounded by modern architecture of Seoul, hotels, restaurants, the City Hall and other important buildings. It’s so easy to get to by train, bus or taxi and it is within walking distance to other attractions. The Palace house also a gallery and a shop. It’s great to stroll around these old buildings and imagine how life might have been way back in the Joseph Dynasty. Right outside of the Palace in the small street on the right of it lies a famous Belgian waffle shop which I’d recommend trying. It’s not Korean but it is claimed to be one of the top 5 dessert shops in Seoul.", January 2020

3,5.0,Deoksugung is a unique palace,"I visited 2 palaces (Deoksugung & Gyeongbokgung) during my visit to Seoul last month. 'though Deoksugung is not as big as Gyeongbokgung, but Deoksugung is quite unique compare to Gyeongbokgung. You can find both Joseon Dynasty & Western influences in this palace, something that you can't see in another palaces in Seoul ..", December 2019
4,5.0,Plan to Visit here and the other Historical Places... and do not rush the enjoyment,Why pay for tour guides when you can hop on and off the subway and visit so many places in Seoul?  This is yet another great place to mark on your tour and enjoy your photos for years to come., January 2020
5,5.0,Beautiful!,A well maintained palace in the modern city. It is smaller than Gyeongbokgong and Changdeokgung. Beautiful scenery!, November 2019
6,4.0,Changing of the guard ,, November 2019
7,5.0,Great guide,"This was the last of four Palaces that we visited while in Seoul and the guide was the best we had experienced.  It was a smaller Palace in comparison to some of the others, but the information regarding buildings, customs and structures carries across them all.  Unfortunately the Change of Guard was postponed due to protests.  Including the free guided tour - we spent around 1.5hours here.", October 2019
8,4.0,Changing of the guards,This is a much smaller palace as compared to the grand Gyeongbokgung palace and is in the heart of the city. We landed there just in time for the changing of the guards ceremony which is again not as elaborate as the one at Gyeongbokgung but is still nice. (You can watch the ceremony from the street. You need a ticket only to enter the palace grounds). The visit does not take much time as the palace grounds are small. The guide pointed out to us some of the structures dating back to 1600, April 2019
9,5.0,A smaller palace if you don't have much time,A smaller palace in the middle of town. Well worth a visit especially if you take the (free) guided tour (about 50 minutes). Time your visit to see the changing of the guard which is quite entertaining., November 2019
10,4.0,Lovely autumn colours,"Deoksugung is right at City Hall Station. I went there to see the City Wall, the external wall of Deoksugung. This time I went inside the palace, as there were lovely maple trees showing beautiful autumn colours. Happened to see also the show performed by the palace guards.", November 2019
11,4.0,Great palace to visit at night,Deoksugung is the only palace open at night and the way it is all lit up is both beautiful and atmospheric. There was a children's concert going on when we visited which we stopped to listen to., September 2019
12,4.0,Wacth the changing of the gurads,Have to go at the right time to see the changing of the guards in front gates. They let you take pictures with them afterwards.Its free and it was really cheap to go into the gardens after if you wanted but we did not go in., May 2019
13,4.0,Good for two Visits,"I really liked this palace. Not as well known as the others but deserves two visits. First, the afternoon changing of the guards is fun to watch and you can stand right next to the guards. Second, this palace stays open at night and makes for some great pictures with the lights on the grounds and the surrounding buildings.", September 2019
14,5.0,Beautiful in the evening ,, October 2019
15,4.0,Pretty nice,"But pretty small. With the audio guide no need to spend more then an hour. Part of the palace pass, which contains five palaces. Come early to see the changing of the guards, but dont enticipate something ""european""", September 2019
16,4.0,Lovely Temple Grounds,"Adjacent City Hall is Deoksugung Temple Grounds which is down the road from the main palace. Outside this temple you can find the Royal Guards performing their Change over ceremonies and other cultural displays. Once you get inside you will find that this temple ground is larger than it first appears with a Cafe/Gift Shop, forested wild pathways, council buildings, an Art museum, temple grounds & buildings and many large art installations. If you arrive during the Korean holidays the temple is free entry, otherwise you will have to pay to enter. There is plenty of exploring to be done in this little area which almost appears hidden from the surrounding city streets like an oasis for people to come and relax or to learn about Art & History or even get a bit of exercise away from the traffic heavy streets of Seoul. I highly recommend a visit to this temple even if it is to waste a little time on your journey around the city.", September 2019
17,3.0,The Smaller And Less Interesting Of The Three palaces,Deoksugung  Palace was used by the King when he was in exile during the Japanese invasion of 1592. This was used as a King's residence until King Gojong died in 1919.There is a mix of ancient and modern architecture. We visited to see the changing of the guard but it was cancelled because of very (very) light rain., September 2019
18,4.0,Changing of the Guard,Good display of the Changing of the Guard on the outside of the palace gates between 10:00-14:00. You don’t need a ticket to watch it from the street. Lasts about 15 minutes with photo opportunities with the actors after the show is over. Worth the trip to see the traditional dress and the parade., September 2019
19,4.0,Closed on Mondays,, September 2019
20,5.0,Day trip to Seoul,"Visited during a day trip. it was very cold but the day went well as the Palace is easy to navigate, and you can listed to the tour in English as well as have an English tour book.", January 2019
21,5.0,Royal Palace,"Deoksugung is one of the 5 royal palaces in Seoul. It is covered by the Royal Palace Pass, but entry is only 1000KW. It is a small palace compared to the other main palaces, but I think one of the nicer and more interesting. The architecture reflects a blend of Korean with western influences.", July 2019
22,5.0,Small palace,This palace is a lot smaller compared to the others. Easily walked through the entire grounds within 30minutes. The changing of guards is not to be missed. The audio guide can be rented at the entrance., July 2019
23,4.0,"Korea, with European influence","Interesting collection of traditional Korean architecture (e.g., Daehanmun Gate, Junghwajeon Hall, etc), a fusion of Korean and European architecture in Jeonggwanheon Hall, then more classical European in Seokjojeon Hall and the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (both fronted by a European garden).  All overlooked by the high rise buildings of modern Seoul!  I relatively small complex, easy to traverse in 60 or 90 minutes, but the architectural contrasts are a highlight.   Along with the changing of the guard!  11am, 2pm, and 3:30pm.  Noisy, colorful and informative - really well presented, and plenty of photo opportunities at the end.", July 2019

26,4.0,Wonderful visit,, June 2019
27,4.0,"Perfect visit, especially for seniors!","The palace, directly across the street from the Seoul City Hall and easily accessible using Exit 2 from the metro City Hall stop, is worth a 2 to 3 hour visit -- especially if one is a senior (65+) for which it is free of charge. The well preserved buildings interesting, as is the art museum which focuses on Korean painters -- a genre which is unfamiliar to many westerners (also free for seniors). Planning your visit around the changing of the guard ceremonies is prudent, as well.", June 2019
28,5.0,Volunteer guide made it perfect,"A high school student called Esther who is my volunteer guide made the trip perfect. She was able to explain about the different buildings, meaning of motifs and emblems, and story of the Princess. Weather is very good in June with sun and nice temperature.

29,4.0,Changing of the guards,, June 2019
30,5.0,Holiday ,We went to Deoksugung. We were very lucky to be escorted by a volunteer guide. He was 16 years old and spoke good English. He took us through the various buildings of the palace and gave us a detailed explanation of the uses of the buildings and the history. This place was not to big and it was an excellent experience. Definitely worth a visit, June 2019
31,5.0,See changing of the guard ceremony,The changing of the guard ceremony takes place outside of the palace grounds in a small courtyard next to the sidewalk. You are very close to all of the participants who are in very colorful costumes.  Great for photos! The park like setting inside the gate is very peaceful. Hard to believe it just off a busy street., April 2019
32,3.0,A rather typical palace with small territory,"Dropped by here because it was on our way, and walked the grounds. A few beautiful nature corners and buildings are picture-worthy, as usual. Otherwise, not much to see here, but if it's on your way it's worth stopping by.", May 2019

36,5.0,Cancelled Changing of the Guards,, March 2019
37,4.0,I liked it here better than...,"...Gyeongbokgung Palace which I thought to be rather bleak (maybe stark). Then again maybe it was because I was on a tour there, and here  I was on my own.  Changing of the Guard Ceremony seemed more intimate here with everyone invited to take pictures with the guards.  I liked the Museum of Modern Art located on the grounds though there was nothing modern about the art at all. I didn't see anything less than a hundred years old in the place.", February 2019
38,4.0,Nice palace. Well maintained. ,, February 2019
39,4.0,Changing Guard Ceremony,We went Deoksugung Palace to see the changing guard ceremony at 11am ( only 15min ). First we went to the hanbok counter to get the free hanbok. We can choose the hanbok and we can wear it for photo around the gate for 10min. We took many pictures with the free hanbok., December 2018
40,5.0,I thought of the country's lost woes!,"It was a strange feeling because it was deoksugung which had come decades ago.  after the emperor Gojong was abandoned by the pressure of japan in the palace history guidbook, he lived here and was called Deoksugung palace. the name of the palace is not pleasant. However, we was doing the gate changing ceremony to remember tttttthe dignity of the palace. when the king was inhabited, could we go to the royal court as easily as we do now? the couple gave free admission togethere as a national merit.", January 2019
41,5.0,Fusion of Korean and Western Architecture,, May 2018
42,4.0,Palace very beautiful,, November 2018
43,5.0,Really love it!,"I seriously fell in love with the palaces in Seoul. This one is definitely definitely recommended to visit. The only palace where you can observe the King’s throne closely. Even though it’s pretty small compared to other palaces, it’s still beautiful. One of the building isn’t painted like other buildings, it’s said that the Emperor Gojong lived there when he’s old and passed away at that exact building. There’s a mixture between western and eastern architectures here. I will come back for sure and maybe will try to book a tour for the Daehan empire history museum ( the only building with western influences where Emperor Gojong used to live and entertain guests).", January 2019
44,3.0,Pick a spot facing the entrance gate!,"Arrived at this palace 15 minutes before the changing guard ceremony. What i can suggest, please pick a spot facing the gate as usually this side can get a first chance to take a pic with the guards and no crowd yet ;-)  One more thing, if you go inside the palace, for senior citizen (>65y.o) is free.", November 2018

47,3.0,Several buildings under renovation ,Changing of the guards was interesting! Like a short theatre production. Interesting history and buildings. Didn't stay long but unfortunately to walk around. Probably would have leqrnedy more if we rented audio guides or took one of the scheduled free tours., November 2018
48,5.0,Under Renovation,"This is probably the smallest palace in Seoul. But what you go there for is the changing of the royal guard ceremony. It happens right outside the gate so it's free. The ceremony takes place every 11am,  2pm, and 3:30pm. Be there 10-15 minutes before so you can get a good spot behind the cordon. They give you time to take photos with them too. Going inside the castle, you'll need to pay 1000 won (youth 500 won). Unless you're wearing a hanbik, then it's free! Some areas wereunder renovation when we visited. You need to walk around the palace and take photos in their stone walls!", November 2018

57,4.0,Enjoyable exploration of this temple complex,"This was the first temple we visited in Seoul and really enjoyed it. It's a pleasant place to explore and its quiet, given it's located in the centre of the city. The architecture is lovely and tranquil.

64,3.0,A little old palace with changing guard ceremony,"It’s smaller than Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung, and Changgyeongung but still interesting. The location is near the Seoul City Hall. The most interesting things are the changing guard time and palace festival (usually around May or October). But for the other months, it’s not that worth it to be visited.", December 2017
65,4.0,Go for the changing of the guard ceremony,Small place which only takes half an our or so to walk around.  Not much to see inside.  The main attraction is the changing of the guard ceremony.  It was excellent.  Lots of interesting uniforms to look at and excellent drummers., September 2017
66,4.0,"Short visit, nice for a hot day","Deoksugung is a lot smaller than the other Seoul palaces (Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung) but it's still worth visiting. It's much more quiet and offers a break from the city on a hot day. Take you time and sit around for awhile, observing locals and enjoying the scenery. Since it's centrally located, Deoksugung also offers great views of traditional palace buildings with a bunch of modern skyscrapers in the background - a combination of old and new that makes Seoul so interesting.", April 2018
67,5.0,Love It,, May 2018

71,5.0,Charming ,"Deoksungung palace is a must to visit if you come to Seoul. Read little bit of history about the place that it will be easy for you to understand the details when you visit. Wear comfortable dress and shoes that you will need to walk around comfortably.You can enjoy the change of gaurds show. There is a lot of things to see and enjoy. You can arrange for a a guide to take you around and explain the details,  but it is not necessarily. Wheelchaired persons can get access too. It is a charming place to visit and highly recommended", April 2018
72,4.0,Nice introduction,, April 2018
73,4.0,Honour Guard Changing Ceremony,The palace is not as big as the rest of the other palace around Seoul but the highlight is the Royal Guard Changing Ceremony that is showcase to tourist every day except Monday at 2 different timing (10am and 1pm).

75,4.0,One of the smaller palaces,"This grounds of this palace are much smaller than most of the others in the city.  Entrance is only 1000kr, however despite the bargain price this place is relatively empty.  This allows you to stroll the grounds and take numerous photos without the hoards of tourists, which you will find in the other palaces.", April 2018
76,5.0,very nice palace,"located at the intersection of Seoul's busiest city center. This is the only palace surrounded by Western-style buildings that add to the uniqueness of the scenery.

81,4.0,Interesting Palace,, March 2018
82,4.0,A must visit Palace,This palace is one of an attraction that happen in the central of Seoul City. You can easily find this place by simple asking people or just follow google maps. It was a nice to get an experienced about old time of South Korea that long time ago has a massive and great kingdom with Kings and Queens. They have some schedule to perform on how the guard change shift between themselves who lead by a general. Quite nice to go in the afternoon or in the morning time.

83,4.0,Night visit,"We visited it just before sunset, it was our only palace to visit at night, different view and Colours at night. We are unaware if you can visit other palaces at night. We would skip it if they do not open the door at night and illuminate the palace.", December 2017
84,4.0,Do u like to drink coffee,"Deoksugung, one of the five palaces of the Joseon Dynasty. This is a very small palace.

85,4.0,A blend of the old and new ,, February 2018
86,5.0,Just at City Hall station,"Peaceful palace and nice scenery just at city hall station. Take a walk to rest your eyes from all the commercial signs.

Check time for performance at the main gate too.", February 2018
87,5.0,Great place to see a blend of the old and the new,Deoksugung Palace is a very unique place to visit for me. On one hand you have a great historical site and just beyond the walls of the palace is the ultra-modern Seoul City Hall and large hotels towering into the sky. The palace itself is a blend of traditional and modern buildings. The palace originated in the mid 1400's and continued to evolve in the 1900's so there is a mixture of buildings on the site. Great to see and well worth the 1000 Won entry fee. The palace is free for seniors., January 2018

95,5.0,Colorful changing of the guard (check the weather).,"I have visited in the past and enjoy the colorful changing of the guard ceremony.  Please see my review from 2012, my first visit, for exact directions and location of Deoksugung Palace.  All renovations now completed inside.  Our visit this time, all changing of the guard ceremonies were cancelled because of the hot weather.  Always be cognizant of the current weather, as they may cancel ceremonies if toohot or too cold.", July 2017
96,4.0,Stone wall Palace,A small palace that is open until 9pm and has a stone wall with scenic ginko trees during fall season and a weekend market.

102,3.0,Disappointing,The backdrop with leaves etc was dramatic. But there really isn’t anything to see inside the structures and we could only appreciate from the outside. Wish there was more. The changing of the guards was a nice bonus., November 2017
103,4.0,Peaceful and beautiful,After my 16 hour flight and few hours sleep walking through a new city can be quite daunting but this was the best place I could have ended up the palace and buildings were lovely and there wasn't too many people.

105,4.0,Elaborate Guard Changing Ceremony,"The Changing of the Guards ceremony was quite elaborate and more detailed than that of the larger Gyeongbokgung Palace.  Unfortunately, the viewing area was smaller so it was hard to enjoy all the pageantry, drills and musical instruments.  The grounds of this palace are adjacent to the City Hall so one sees the contrast of the modern and traditional buildings.", September 2017
106,3.0,A small palace,"Unless you cannot visit Gyeongbokgung Palace or Changdeokgung Palace, do not bother to visit here, as it is a very small palace.", October 2017
107,5.0,The best palace,"Of the five palaces in the heart of Seoul, the Deoksugung is probably the most interesting, even if it's the smallest site. But come at night. It's open until 9:00PM and looks particularly interesting once it's floodlit under the night sky. Some of the pavilion's are actually accessible (unlike any of the other palaces) and there are art displays to view. Plus, the main pavilion has the doors open to spy the intricate ceiling. The only snag of coming at night is that the on site museum is only open until 5:00PM. Buy the Palace Pass (it's W10,000 for the five museums and the shrine) to get the best deal.", October 2017
108,4.0,Another beautiful palace.,"Had the opportunity to witness the change of guard. Steep in tradition, the colours were just beautiful to watch. The palace was beautifully built, location was super convenient. A beautiful experience in Seoul.", October 2017
109,4.0,"Nice grounds, well-located near City Hall","This palace was very near our hotel and close to City Hall which is one of the most active places on weekends.  We strolled the grounds which, while not as impressive as those at other palaces, were pleasant.  The Changing of the Guards is colorful and impressive and is worth scheduling your time to catch.", September 2017
110,4.0,Stay for the guard changing ceremony,"The regular changing of the guards ceremony is worth seeing, with an English language commentary. A very convenient location just across the road from Seoul city hall (and the city hall itself is worth visiting, the basement had an archeological display). As for the many temples we visited one tends to forget the specifics of each palace. I remember that one of the palace buildings had an organised tour (only way to get in) but this needs to be booked in advance. By the way I was entitled to free entry to many of the palaces and temples due to being over 65, a great deal! Worth a visit and easy to get to.", September 2017
111,5.0,Nice changing of guards ceremony,"We took the subway here and exited at City Hall station. It was a smaller palace complex but nice nevertheless. We came around lunch time and were fortunate to be able to witness the changing of guards ceremony here. It was a very colourful affair. Entrance was KRW 1000 which we reckon was cheap. As most of the main palaces were near each other, you can actually walk from one palace to the other, if you don't mind walking.", October 2016

121,5.0,Great place to visit!  Free to foreigners!,We visited this palace during a bright sunny day.  Encountered some outdoor traditional Korean entertainment during our visit.  It was a great experience!  On the good side of this visit is that the entrance fee is waived for foreigners and we could go back as many times as we wanted.  We opted to go back a second time during our stay in Seoul because we were with a local friend who couldn't enter one of the buildings without registering on-line., April 2017
122,4.0,Quiet place to visit in the evening!,"We visited many similar palaces all over the city where there were hundreds of people rushing about.  This palace was different because it is smaller, less visited, and peaceful.  A great place to visit in the evening.  Trees were blooming as well.  Very cheap to enter at KRW 1,000.", May 2017

124,4.0,A combination of tradition and modern,"The palace was not too large, in compared with Gyeongbukgung or Changdeokgung, but it was easier to find as it was right out City Hall station and opposite the City Hall of Seoul. Half of the palace was as traditional as other palaces in Korea, but the other half was totally different with Western-style building, pond, fountain and garden that made me very impressed!", July 2017
125,5.0,A lovely park in downtown with some ancient palaces and temples,This place is an absolute must when in Seoul.

130,3.0,More park than palace,"Very convenient to the CBD area and a short walk from some of the major hotels.  Lacks information and signage to give a feel for how the place looked in its prime and how the place was used.  Odd collection of buildings of various ages, some in traditional style and some in ""western"" (read brutalist ugly) style.  Worth a visit, but 30 minutes probably all you need", June 2017

132,4.0,Central location and less crowded...,"Two reasons to visit Deoksugung Palace - it's centrally located next to City Hall right in the middle of the city, and it's less crowded compared to its bigger and more illustrious siblings. If you only have 1 hour to spare and would like to experience a Joseon Dynasty palace, this is it. At only KRW 1,000 entrance fees, you not only get to experience this, but also to witness the Changing of the Palace Guard ceremony (at 11 a.m) and explore the beautiful western-style architecture of Seokjojeon Hall and its lovely fountain garden.", June 2017
133,3.0,If time ,There are many other palaces that are more with to visit I then this one. This one is nice but if only you have lots of time to kill in Seoul. Otherwise you can skip it. It cost 1000 won, June 2017
134,5.0,Near the city hall,"It was the first palace we went to and it didn't disappoint. We got lucky to go around 11am to witness the changing of the guards ceremony. Inside the palace is windy so it's relaxing to walk even if it's so hot in the afternoon. We went there in the 2nd week of June, it's summer already. Not that big compared to Gyeongbokgung.", June 2017
135,4.0,"Smaller than Kyeongbokgung, but also less crowded.","I actually tell visitors to visit Deoksugung instead of Kyeongbokgung many times. If you want to see a palace, this is a good starter palace to see. You will not be walking in wall to wall bodies like at Kyeongbokgung. You get way more bang for the won, so to speak.  I was pleasantly surprised by Deoksugung.", June 2017

View from the street side of the roped square for best pictures without commercial store or kiosks in the background.

144,3.0,It's part of the palace,"I'm not sure why it's listed as a separate attraction since it's part of the palace, one of many buildings in the palace. The buildings are replicas and are empty. The story we were given is that they are afraid that if they furnish the place, the furniture could be used as weapons.", April 2017
145,4.0,Beautifully lit in the evening,"Deoksugung palace is one of the five grand palaces built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty. This palace is smaller than for instance Changdeokgung Palace or Gyeongbok Palace, but really worth a visit. Entrance tickets are really cheap and the buildings on the palace grounds are an interesting mixture of Korean and Eastern style buildings. The Deoksugung palace is also the only palace which stays open in the evening. A visit in the evening is highly recommended, because the buildings are beautifully lit. If you're a photographer, don't forget to bring your tripod!", March 2017
146,5.0,Worth the visit,I decided to visit this palace quite last minute and was impressed by the architecture inside it (East meets West). The change of guard ceremony was a lot more impressive than the one at Gyeongbokgung Palace. Don't miss it!, April 2017

153,4.0,One of the palace,One of the palace in seoul. Located in city hall. They have a changing of guard ceremony every day. Entrance fee is 1000 krw., August 2016
154,4.0,Can-do but worthwhile,"I would do Gyeongbokgung Palace and Changdeokgung Palace first. If you are then still keen on yet another palace, Deoksugung is a good choice. Much smaller than the other palaces, it is rather more intimate and there are less tourists. Also, it has not been rebuilt so the atmosphere is more historic than at Gyeongbokgung.", February 2017
155,4.0,Interesting! ,This is one of the most interesting Palace I have visited. History of it is good but the traditional and modern buildings within Deoksugung is more interesting. It shows how South Korea slowly learning from the western culture. Interesting place!, February 2017
156,4.0,just across the street,"I stayed in The Plaza Hotel so it is very easy for me to reach this palace. The buildings are well preserved and incredibly beautiful, exactly like what you see on the dramas or movies. Definitely clean and tidy in every corner of the complex. Too bad I only spent less than 1 hour in this place. I will advice you to spend at least 2 hours in order to really enjoy your moment there. It has particular times where you can see the traditional dance performance and palace guards' shift-changing ritual.", June 2016
157,3.0,Open until 9pm. Modern and Korean buildings. Watch the changing guard ceremony. ,, February 2017
158,4.0,Check out the Museum,"As I have done most of the palaces, this one didn't have anything special, no must see factor until I went round the Historical Museum. This was the tick in the box for this Palace. The w1000 also includes the museum, and if you want to walk round head over as soon as you arrive and get yourself on a tour. It is access by tour only and they leave every 30 minutes, but gets full quick as the groups are only small. Shoes off and slippers on, they gave me an English audio so I could follow round, but obviously the passionate guide was giving the locals much more than I was hearing. All renovated in the last 10 years, but decorated as best as they could from old photos and with some of the original furniture. The history you get is the best thing and even some photos of the old emperors and emperoresses. Your 1000 doesn't also get you into the art gallery, that will cost you more.", February 2017
159,5.0,Interesting mélange of architectural styles,"Nice collection of palaces, both ancient and modern, eastern and western. Quite small compared to other palaces, but well worth visiting as so unique, making great photographic  juxtapositions.

162,5.0,My favorite among the palaces,"While this palace doesn't have the sprawling grounds of some of the others - it is stunning. The lawns are so well-manicured, and the mixture of the architecture styles is quite interesting to see. Some of the more ""European"" style buildings were constructed on the palace grounds during the Japanese occupation I believe. there is also a small annex of the Seoul City Art Museum inside the grounds which holds small exhibitions. I got to see a gorgeous collection of antique Cartier jewelry by chance in there one day. Such a fun surprise. I would say this palace is a must see!", September 2016

166,4.0,A must visit!,"A nice architecture and you can also experience the guard changing ceremony here.

169,4.0,A small Palace,A very small Palace but the Royal guard changing ceremony is good. It's the only Palace that has both Korean and western buildings. Same as Gyeongbokgung  if u wants to watch the Guard changing ceremony the time will clash with the guided tour so can only choose one., December 2016
170,4.0,Excellent for the value!,"I happened to go on the perfect day. I got there right when the changing of the guard was happening (happens at 11:00am, 2pm, and 3:00pm). And it was free for everyone that day (normal admission is ₩3,000). The National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Deoksugung  is free but you need to make a reservation for the Seokjojeon Hall: Neoclassical Western Style Building. This place is great to see the difference between modern and old but you'll be done in an hour maximum. Go to City Hall Station Exit 2 from Line 1 or Exit 12 from Line 2.", December 2016

172,4.0,Palace in center of city,This Palace is across the street from City Hall.  It is not as large as the other palaces but has the Changing of the Guard Ceremony which is very interesting and if you make special reservations you can tour the European buildings from the early 1900's which is unique here.   Only 1000 won ($1) to enter--so worth it!!, November 2016

It has a palace with a central court, a bell building and a fountain. It is one of those that has been destroyed during the Japanese colonization and currently only a third of the original building is left, but what is left is worth seeing.", October 2016
179,4.0,I had fun!,"OK, I admit it - I was a lucky one.  But first, some background.  Outside the main gate, at certain times you'll have to look up, they have a stand for individuals to dress in traditional outfits and take photos.  This is timed to coincide with the changing of the guard ceremonies, replicating the traditional method of days gone by.  They select a tourist to participate.  Being selected made the visit inside even more magnetic.  It's not huge inside, but it shows some history, including some modern aspects.  If you like history, sign up for the Seokjojeon Hall (in advance on webpage).  It's newer but fancy.  If your time in Seoul is limited, you'd probably want to skip the palace tour.", October 2016
