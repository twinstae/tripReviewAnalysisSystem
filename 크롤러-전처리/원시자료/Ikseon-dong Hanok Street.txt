0,5.0,Good for cafe-hopping,Recommended by a local to visit which turns out to be one of the most memorable moment of our trip. The area is made up of connecting alleys which makes you feel like you are in a maze but there's something good waiting for you at every turn. Quaint little shops and cafes, January 2020
1,4.0,Modern and cute fashionable street .,"Lot of shops , cafes but none got seats . Only good for photography and window shopping . Ladies accessories shops are nice though .", December 2019
2,5.0,Cute little place with loads of instagram worthy cafes,"We took a leisurely walk from our hotel near Euljiro 3-ga to Ikseon-dong Hanok Street. It is relatively easy to locate. You can use NaverMap to guide you there as google map doesn’t work well in South Korea. Loads of instagram worthy spots and cafes. There is a nice little hotteok stall near Seine Dessert. Seine Dessert is another cute little cafe with pretty desserts and nice and different European themed interior on each floor. Apart from Hotteok, we tried the pancake at Flipper’s. How was the pancake? Good, but i still prefer Pauline Pancake. Apart from Cafes, there are also bakeries and shops that sells hats, accessories and flowers. You can spend some good 2 hours in this area.", December 2019
3,3.0,"Interesting, but not a must visit","Tiny alley ways lead you to various stores. That's about all there was to this place. It would be a fun place to go as a small group, but as a solo traveler on this date of visit, I didn't find too many places to eat that could accommodate me as the lines were long, but tables are configured for parties of 2 or more. One of the reasons to visit was that it was near other large must visit attractions in Seoul, so taking an hour to swing by here is not that big of a deal.", December 2019
4,4.0,Ikseon-dong Hanok Street,"We were recommended to tour this area by another tourist who was also visiting the Bukchon village.  Surprisingly enough, it was situated relatively close to our hotel.  It is an interesting area filled with trendy shops, eateries and cafes.  Apparently this is one of Seoul's oldest neighborhoods that dates back to the 1920's and many of the traditional old style hanoks have been renovated to house trendy eateries and boutiques.  One can still see traditional roof lines and careful restoration of traditional buildings in this area.   It has narrow laneways and it doesn't take much for the area to get overcrowded.  If you like people watching and visiting trendy shops, you can spend an indefinite period of time here.", November 2019

Will  be back there again.", October 2019

18,4.0,"Hidden gems, tiny alleys","Ikseon-Dong, just a short walk over from Insa-dong has its charm. This tiny traditional area is full of charm. Tiny alleys lead to hidden gems - colorful souvenir shops, themed cafes, tea houses and restaurants. There are clothes shops too. If you are a photography enthusiast there are many spaces and interior-exterior design spaces waiting to be captured. You will be walking around with a smile, but beware this place is so crowded. When I visited it seemed like half of Korea was there. I didn’t mind too much, other than there were line ups for cafes and restaurants. I will go back again and try to get there before lunch time.", May 2019
