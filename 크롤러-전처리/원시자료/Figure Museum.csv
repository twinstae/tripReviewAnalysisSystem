1,4.0,Figure Museum W,"The museum is located in Cheongdam-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul. All types of visitors can enjoy this museum. It consist of six themes - super hero, anime, etc. It also has a coffee shop and a store if you want to shop for figurines. Those who love collecting or watching animes/cartoons, this place is for you.", May 2018
2,5.0,Love the displays,"Not too hard to miss as you can see quite a few characters outside. Getting in is a bit harder since the door is atypical and you need to touch the button to get in, almost like a space ship. The entry fee was covered by the Discover Seoul pass.Once inside we went to the top of the building and made our way down the myriad of displays in the building. I quite enjoyed them because they were mostly ones which I recognise and like, including Marvel, DC, Gundam, DBZ and One PIece.I really enjoyed taking my time just looking at all the different figurines on display, particularly the life sized ones like the Hulk Buster. The vault on the top floor was also quite cool since you can check on the screen in front of you for details of the figurines. The only problem was that it got a bit hard to see the ones near the top and edges.After the browsing, you can buy some stuff yourself at the shop by the entrance.", December 2017
3,4.0,Good for toy enthusiasts,My husband and father in law had the best time there. It’s like there’s a surprise on each floor they visited. It was properly maintained (it even smells good there haha). We went there on a Thursday and it wasn’t crowded. Easy to find via Google Maps. The toys they sold at the ground floor were a bit expensive but we bought some as souvenirs., March 2018
4,4.0,Our Mini Family Adventure in Seoul 2017,It was our 3rd family holidays in Seoul with our 5 yrs old 7 mths daughter. The figure is my husband wishlist so we went early after our breakfast via subway. It is not difficult to find and once we get out from the exit then walk few steps. It not too big but i think up to 3/ 4 level. I miss a chance to take spiderman picture ^-^, July 2017
