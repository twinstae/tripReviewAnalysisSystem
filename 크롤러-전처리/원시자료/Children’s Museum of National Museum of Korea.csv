0,4.0,"Korean culture, fun, free but need to register, good for extreme weather day","We visited here during our winter holiday. This museum was not big enough and had so many activities for kids. Most of the informations were in Hangeul, but our children could enjoy it.   There are some activities that required papers (the papers are not free). Near this museum", January 2018

2,4.0,Great fun for kids even if it's in Korean,"You'll get free tickets for the sessions at the reception counter and each session last for slightly less than 2 hours which was appropriate for young kids.  We didn't speak Korean but the kids still enjoyed a good mix of drawing / puzzle / games.  Also a great way to learn about Korean culture.  For some of the activities, you will need to buy a folder at the gift shop and costed around KRW1,2000.  The adjacent food court provided a good range of food options - Tonkatsu was a popular choice and looked delicious.", February 2017
3,3.0,Cute ,"This is a tiny museum inside the National Museum of Korea. Good for maybe a 30min walk through. Only a few exhibits were in English but the kids could understand most of it. Mostly interactive exhibits, many puzzles, and a dress up part where you could take pictures wearing a Korean king and queen costume. Free entrance.", March 2016
4,5.0,It is over my expectation!,"The museum is a bit far from where we were staying if taking metro, so we end up taking taxi back.  The museum got 3 floors with different kinds of activities for different age groups, and most of the activities are quite detail and educational.  My 3 year olds boy loves it so much.. he didn't want to leave.", December 2015
5,4.0,"Smallish, but great interactive museum for kids (and adults!!)","We visited here on a rainy morning, and it was a great experience. Free entry, and it wasn't very busy. This is a great activity to do on a rainy or very hot/cold day - a time when you need an indoor activity!!I would definitely go again. Bring a piece of paper so you can do the stamping activities! My boys as 16 months and 3 years, and they really loved wandering around touching everything, dressing up in traditional clothes, putting together pottery, and exploring a small sized castle!", April 2015
