The night time views were magical as we ended by the river front.

From bicycle, rollers to scooters. You can rent easily but not for very small children. During the festival there are many food stalls and activities, so within these 2 weeks you'll get culture, happenings trends and current local favorites.  Since the event is outdoor do prepare umbrella as early April (when the flowers bloom) means there's rain every now and then and the temperature is still chilly.

Before I was able to enjoy all the cherry blossoms, I was blocked my people and street food carts that were everywhere. It was not visually pleasing to see all these street carts under the beautiful cherry blossom trees. I couldn't take a decent picture because there would be trash and street carts in the background. :( Due to the street food, trashes were everywhere and it was hard to even find a trashcan.

Unless you are spending a lot of time in Seoul, I do not think you will want to take the time to visit here.  I hope you will have the time because it is so refreshing and restful.  Take the metro, line 5, purple line and get off at Yeouinaru station and the park will be right in front of you.  The entire park takes a T shape, all along the river and the middle from the river inland.  But the river section is ideal.  Lots of native trees, plants and flowers, walking trials, skateboarders, bikers and benches for resting.  Unfortunately this was not cherry blossom time, otherwise it would be even more beautiful.  As I was just passing thru to building 63, next time I will enjoy and investigate more of this huge park, especially the Korean Forest with all native foliage, and culture square.  If you have time and need a peaceful break from sightseeing and shopping, visit Yeouido Park.  If it is summer and very sunny, a hat might be recommended.", June 2015
