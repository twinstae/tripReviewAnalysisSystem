2,5.0,"Great Experience, Potentially Fantastic Views","Unfortunately the day we went up the tower it was very cloudy, but that didn't affect our experience. The setup they have is very cool, and the double decker elevator was very interesting. Glass floor and open air areas were both fascinating. Prices for souvenirs weren't that bad either. Views must be great, but we just couldn't see that far. On a clear day, I 100% recommend going up the tower.", December 2019

4,3.0,Seoul Sky Tower,I thought the ride up would be unnerving. But it wasn't. I didn't feel anything in the lift from ground floor going up to 120th floor. And it only took 1 minute. Definitely state of the art technology., December 2019

11,1.0,Worst experience in seoul,"Very long queue going UP. Staffs keep on explaining in Korean, not even speaking in English.

12,5.0,Loved it,"You can't travel to Seoul without visiting Seoul Sky, and getting a spectacular view of the city.  The observation floors allow one to see Seoul that is only possible at that elevation.  The observation floors are from 117-123rd floors.  The highest floor is a bar and restaurant.   The ticket to Seoul Sky allows access to all the floors.   No matter what floor you are on, you'll enjoy a great view of the Korean capital.", October 2019
13,5.0,Fantastic observatory experience,, October 2019
14,4.0,Worth a visit,Magnificent views of Seoul from the Seoul Sky observation deck in Lotte World Tower. There are several floors between the 117 and 120 floors designated to observing the panoramic  views of all of Seoul. There are various cafes and shops located at the top. In addition there are glass floor panels in a few places where you can really test your vertigo! It’s worth the visit to give perspective and an appreciation of the phenomenal development of Seoul., September 2019
15,5.0,A must go attraction!,Amazing attraction! I would highly recommend splurging on getting a drink in the 123 lounge as the view is amazing and it feels very high end! Great date night option as well! If you do go I would suggest getting your tickets on the Klook app! You can buy a bundle pack for most of the Lotte locations for about $50 a person!, September 2019
16,5.0,Seoul Tower a place must visit,"Great view of the entire city from above. It a tourist destination must visit when in Seoul. Just love it! Ticket price at W27,000 per person. The elevator is superb fast. In a few second you are up to the top.", August 2019

20,3.0,SEOUL SKY TOWER,, May 2019
21,5.0,Go early on a clear day,"We had five days of cloudy weather in Seoul in early June. We went to the Lotte Tower Seoul Sky on the first sunny day of our trip. I was worried that it would be very crowded on a Saturday, but we got in line for tickets about 30 minutes before the place opened. We were the first people on the elevator. As soon as we got to the top observatory desk, we took photos with very few other people around. After about 15 minutes, large groups of tourists entered and it was much more difficult to take pictures. You cannot buy tickets online unless you have a Korean cell phone. I did buy tickets online through Klook at a slight discount and then showed my phone to the person at the Seoul Sky ticket desk. She printed out our tickets to get on the elevator. I would highly recommend this place, but not on a cloudy or rainy day.", June 2019

We sat in the bar overlooking the old Olympic site, and it was a stunning view. From the rest of the vantage points you could see the city in a totally different light. Well worth doing! We didn’t book ahead, we arrived around 1030 and the line wasn’t too long, so don’t worry too much if you’re a last minute planner", May 2019

30,1.0,Seoul Sky - Bad experience on Service and responsibility of service condition,"I visited Seoul Sky on 18 Apr 2019 and didn't notice that there was too much smoke in the sky or not, but staff ignored to inform any proper info to us. They just sell ticket and cannot speak English. In the entrance area, Service staff also delivered bad service to guests, not provide any info and forced us to walk into the gate urgently. Finally, we have failed to see anything on the top. There were too much smoke. I just wondered that why they want to sell the tickets without considering the guests would be satisfied on view on not. If customers have no chance to see clearly on that day, they shouldn't sell any tickets. So weird!!!!!", April 2019

34,4.0,It's get better base on Weather,"Dust fogging up Seoul is a big issue, so watching for clear sky is the biggest factor when going to Seoul Sky. It offers a beautiful 360 view of Seoul. Even the elevator ride is cool with it's visual presentation prior to reaching for the skies. As with most attractions, there's plenty of stop along the way to get that perfect picture for purchase just in case the selfie's and the weather is not all that great because they always have a beautiful blue sky. There's plenty to do around the area, so it worth the going on if you can catch good weather.", February 2019

36,5.0,Better than Namsan Tower in Many Ways,"I love Namsan Tower; however, it is a hike to get to and the weather has to be in your favor.   I visited Seoul Sky this past summer (in July) and would recommend Seoul Sky for everyone, especially if you have someone in your group with health issues where going to Namsan tower (walking up incline hills, many stairs, etc) is not easy.   Seoul Sky, you simply go to Lotte Mall and use the elevator. No hills or stairs involved.  They have a glass bottom floor in the observatory which is really cool.  You have a great view looking down at the castle in Lotte World Adventure Park.", July 2018

39,5.0,Majestic View,"The 5th tallest building in the world.. world's fastest double decker elevator.. tallest building in South Korea.. whether day or night, spring summer fall or winter it's worth the experience to go here. Consists of 123 floors and the glass observatory is located on the 117th to 123rd floor. You'll see a 360 degrees panoramic view of the entire Seoul city. Plus it will only take you 1 minute from the basement to the observatory.", December 2018
40,4.0,My first experience in the top of the building ,, August 2018
41,2.0,Not practical for disabled person’s family ,My sister and I took my mom here for sky tower. From the beginning they made us separate because only one person allowed to carry the wheelchair. It’s is so hard to meet after we separated. Couldn’t take a group picture and needed call each other’s where we are. So inconvenient service., January 2019
42,4.0,Amazing view...glass floor,"I was dubious about going to this attraction--everyone has been in a tall building--but it was fascinating.  The lower level explains the construction and engineering which was more interesting that i expected.  The elevator up is only a minute and is one of the fastest elevators--there are all sorts of guiness record book items to quote.  I really liked the glass bottom floor, but it took me awhile to step out on it.  Take a picture looking down with your shoes in it for perspective.  I wish we had longer as i would have liked to enjoy a cocktail in the lounge and look at the view!", December 2018
43,4.0,Great view with good weather ,"Nice view from above on Seoul. Gives a good impression of the city. It is worth a visit, but a little pricey.", November 2018
44,5.0,Amazing view!,The very quick elevator trip was the best as there were LED screens inside where a video is played to entertain the audience. And the drop off point is on the 117th floor where the view of the whole city can be seen. You can go up to the 123rd floor and each floor offers different activities., November 2018
45,5.0,Worth the Money!,"Being 500 meters up is not something you do every day. you can selfie yourself to death, on 121, 122 and 124 floor and have a great coffee at the upper-level lounge.  come before sunset and enjoy day, sunset and night time up in the air.", October 2018
46,1.0,View!,Amazing view. 6 storey to appreciate the the beauty of the skyline at a different level. Only thing they can do better is the restaurant manager at the 123 floor not to be snobbish if we happened to be up there not for dinning but just to see how the restaurant is like. Just because we are not dinning there doesn't mean we can't afford to eat there and hence the snobbish treatment., October 2018

49,5.0,Highlight of my Seoul trip,This place was the highlight of my trip to Seoul! Make sure that you will go there before sunset so you can stay and also see the night view.

51,5.0,Definitely worth the time and the money,"This was at least 1,000 times cooler than I expected.  The glass floors, and the views are amazing.  The elevator ride itself is super cool, and probably worth doing in itself.  There are some refreshments at the top of the tower, which is pretty nice.  I am very glad we did this, and I would certainly do this again.", July 2018
52,5.0,Breathtaking Views ,"Take metro to Jamsil station (metro line 2 or 8)  Buy tickets to the observatory deck at B2. Wasn't crowded on a weekday. 27,000 won for adults (ages 13 and up), 24000 won for children. The observatory deck offers an unparalleled 360-degree view of Seoul. Would prefer this to N Seoul Tower anyday.", September 2018

54,4.0,Precious view of Seoul,It is fun to go up so fast to 117 floors in a double-deck elevator.  The view is most precious at sunset so try to go between 5 and 7pm depending on the season so you can watch the sunset and night., August 2018
55,5.0,Highly recommend having a beer at the top,, August 2018

59,5.0,"Awesome View, Worth It!","You can just buy your ticket there, you can stay there for as long as you want. We stayed there for awhile because we wanted to see how it looked like at night as well. It was really cool. The glass floors were great and kind of scary but it makes for a really good picture. Go there at like 5 or 4 pm and stay until sunset. Its really so nice to see Seoul from up high.", April 2018

73,4.0,Great Experience,"When we visited the observation deck of Lotte Tower, it was not very crowded and this made the experience fantastic. This is the third-tallest observation deck in the world and it has the highest glass floor in the world. There's also ""balconies"" which are more like a portion without a ceiling since the windows are still a storey high. Overall, we really enjoyed seeing and experiencing the tower. I wish I could rate it 4.5 because the view isn't as nice as the view from N Tower (however, the experience is much better).", September 2017

At level 0, after the ticket office you can see a movie from during the construction of this tower - the first shock (for the civil engineers it is very interesting).

On the 118 floor  two sky deck will prove whether you are afraid the height or not.  After that, we take a coffee break at the 122 floor .  A place must try as you can see the landscape changing.

Landmarks are well marked and identified on each level.  You can even venture outside on an outdoor deck. Lots of great photo opportunities.    I definitely will return for a second visit.

We knew everything would be pricey, so we just ordered the cheese plate ($23 US) and were shocked at how big it was!  It was the perfect snack for us as we wanted to eat elsewhere that night but it was worth going up to the top for it.  The views were stunning that day and hardly anyone to compete with the view.

Visibility was only 6 km the morning we went, and though the views of the city were still quite impressive it could have been much more exciting on a clearer day. We took the subway to Jamsil station to access the tower. The elevator to the top of the tower/observatory is amazingly fast and offers smooth ride more than 100+ floors up in 60 seconds! We thought the staff did a great job controlling the crowds and were able to see everything we wanted to at the observatory.
