2,4.0,A pleasure to visit always,"The park is easily accessible by subway (Mongchontoseong Station) on Line 8, near Jamsil. It is a large park with beautiful scenery. The best is to go there in the afternoon, take the path on the right and then walk anti-clockwise around the park.

3,4.0,Great to see an Olympic Park so well used many years after the games,I love the Olympics and have visited a number of Olympic cities over the years. How they use the park after the games varies a lot from country to county. Here in Seoul it was good to see the park so busy and well used although turning the former Olympic stadium into an O2 type venue has obviously helped. The Olympic gate and flame were worth seeing., September 2019

Also there is a big lake in the middle of the park, and it also has many trees, flowers and grasses, so that people can see great views of a natural environment.

20,3.0,Worth paying a visit,"The Olympic Park is a very diverse place to start off, lots of trees and sub-nature but also a lot of facilities. You can really experience much in the Olympic Park touring the statues, buildings and more. One thing about the park overall is that the facilities are quite outdated, so if you are a type of person who likes fresh and all clean facilities, I do not recommend this place to you.

25,5.0,Lots to see,The only problem with this lovely park is that in sub zero temperatures it’s impossible to walk round all of it.  There is a monument with lots of information about how the games came to Seoul as well as names of all the gold medal winners. The outdoor sculptures are excellent but the indoor display was a bit too modern for me., January 2019
26,5.0,Beautiful in autumn,"The Olympic Park is most beautiful in autumn, particularly towards sunset. There are two main entrances, Previously I came out from Metro station 813 on Line 8 (Monchontoseong) and could see the Olympic arch right in front of me. However this time I came out of the Olympic Park metro station P550, after changing at Gangdong on Line 5. A bit confused, I walked straight and then walked around the park in a counter-clockwise direction. It took a couple of hours of leisurely walk to get back to Monchongtoseong but it was worth the trouble. The scenery was really beautiful in autumn, all along the walk. At one point I was lost at a junction in the park. The sun was going down but I was still quite far away from the park entrance. The signs were all in Korean (no English); what a pity! Tried Google Map but it was not much help. Anyway, I gambled and took the uphill path on my right instead of the level walk on the left; fortunately it worked out. The path brought me to a bridge and the surrounding sunset scenery was fascinating. Further down, I recognized the large courtyard with many flags; the Monchontoseong station was right behind the Olympic arch. Actually there is a short-cut path between the two main entrances, but if you take this shortcut, you will miss most of the beautiful scenery.", November 2018
27,5.0,A Vibrant Happening Place for All,"We visited on a fine autumn day. Autumn foliage was everywhere and made the park so beautiful. It is a big place, so it does not feel crowded.

108,4.0,Trip down history lane!,"Although the day was cloudy, we took the bike ride around the pathways and gardens while looking at the facilities from 1988 Olympics. Some buildings were very tired and locked to the public; others had been turned into day care centers however the gardens, statues and memories were terrific. The gardens were turning with the autumn colours and many flowers were still out. Pretty great all round - well worth the couple of hours.", October 2016
109,5.0,Glorious autumn leaves walk!,"Oh this was one of our most favorite days in Seoul. The park was big, beautiful and so well maintained. We went through the main entrance first because the street beside it is famous for the beautiful rows of yellow leave trees (forgotten their names!) but the park itself is just as stunning! Very peaceful, great for a stroll and picnic. The small speakers around the park even had classical music playing out of it which was a cute touch. LOVED this place!", November 2015
110,4.0,Great place to walk,"This Olympic park has been kept in great condition and is still a wonderful place to walk around on a nice day. There are plenty of different areas as the park is so big. There are several sports facilities still on the site, as well as bike hire.

There are lots of fun (modern art) sculptures scattered on the grounds of the 1988 Olympic grounds. Not sure if the venues are open, I didn't go inside any except the museum which was wonderful.

114,3.0,Nice but nothing more,Its great that Seoul has gotten use of their olympic park. Its a nice area where you get to see some historical thing along with the old stadiums. But its doesnt give a lot more than that. Plan a shorter trip here. You might be lucky and be in Seoul when they arrange events in the park., September 2016
115,5.0,Lovely park,, September 2016

On my way to swimming pool, (for half day admission 6,000 KRW, =about 6 USD, you can choose morning session or afternoon session), I could enjoy my walk from the station to the pool. Since this pool was used for the 1988 Olympic Games, quite fun to see the pool. If I had more energy, I wanted to take a seat and read a book under the nice weather. Entering grass is not allowed for the winter, as far as I know.", September 2016
118,4.0,Be ready for lots of walking,"I think a bike would be best to explore this place. They are allowed everywhere, and you would save a lot of steps. We only spent about an hour, but could go inside many of the buildings, such as the gymnastics arena, the indoor pool, etc.  wish we could have found a gift shop.  Lots of great Statues here. The acupressure path lets you walk on a walkway made of many types of stones, wooden beams, etc. that excercise parts of your feet. Print a map before you go, you'll be glad you did, if speaking English. Lots of drink vending machines along paths, and public restrooms are clean, free.", September 2016

Walking for a bit I started to also see the several interesting and somewhat curious sculptures along with a map of the grounds. IF you just want to see the World Peace Gate then go to the West Gate and you are good. If you however want a wonderful walk alongside with interesting sights on your way - the East Gate is a good point. Along with the statues you can enjoy a peaceful walk with the locals going about their everyday activities. The closer I got to the West Gate I found, tucked away cutely, a wonderful small water mill and simply continued discovering the grounds. The World Peace Gate is naturally an interesting sight, but the park as total is what I recommend.", July 2016

I got off at the Olympic Park Station but would actually recommend going to the Mongchontoseong Station since it's near the World Peace Gate. That and several structures around it (place with all the flags) are the best photo opportunities.  It's basically a HUGE park, which isn't bad if you just want to relax and enjoy the scenery or get some exercise.  If you so choose, there are actually fitness machines that you can use at the park.", October 2015

133,4.0,Just because I love the Olympics,"There wasn’t much to do but then again it is still the Olympic Park of the 1988 games. The Olympic flame is still there and so are museums. If you don’t get a bike, be prepared to walk. It is a bit run down now but so are many of the 2008 Olympic sites in Beijing and that occurred 20 years later. What we liked the most, and I am a big guy and love food is at night, they have a gathering of vendors and they bring together food from around the world. It was an enjoyable evening and I was able to taste food from around the world.", February 2016
134,4.0,A nice place to exercise,"This park is huge. It offers a good and free museum about the Baekje Kingdom, including a historical fortress wall walking trail (the wall itself is long gone).

137,5.0,bigbang at olympic park,I came here to see BigBang's concert in march 2016.  This place is nice to walk around and take photos.  There were street food vendors so you don't need to worry about going hungry.  For some odd reason I did not see any taxi stand and it was hard to catch a taxi since the road was gated off at the main entrance.  My other mistake was taking a taxi here to the concert at 6pm.  It was a total disaster.  Taking the subway would've been easier and faster during rush hour., March 2016
138,5.0,Well designed park,"I was travelling with a sports enthusiast thus we had to visit the Olympic Park. The admission is free and there is a long path with modern art sculpture. If you want to go to the Olympic Museum avoid SOMA (Seoul Olympic Museum of Art) as it has nothing to do with olympics and costs 3,000₩ - wasted money.", May 2016
139,3.0,Place where to rest in the busy city,"Good for walk, peaceful, quite quiet place. But don't expect too much, it's just a park, not even an extraordinary one. You can rent a double bike buggy there, too bad we found that out when already leaving, otherwise we would definitely go for it.", June 2015

I highly recommend going on a weekday however to avoid a mass crowd of people though, but overall, its nice, spacious, and good for the kids to run around and have fun.

Not a really big deal beyond that.  it has a lot of history since this is where the 1988 summer games were held, but you can't get into any of the buildings so there is really nothing to do.  You walk around and look at the big stadiums.  If you love a walk in the park, this is for you.  If you are looking to explore the Olympic complexes, that's not happening.", December 2015

It is quite a sight when you exit the Monchongtoseong subway station and emerge up the steps to get your first glimpse of the majestic World Peace Gate, with the Olympic rings proudly displayed, and the surrounding colonnade of flags of all the countries that participated in the 1988 Olympics. I enjoyed spotting the flags of the many countries which no longer exist today and reading about the events of the 1988 Games on the long memorial beside the beautiful lake, which has lovely fountains that come on at the top of the hour. The extensive park is beautifully maintained and the Mongchon Fortress Promenade along the top of the ramparts of the ancient Mongchon fortress, which stood here hundreds of years ago, offers incredible views of Seoul in all directions and is a must-do. It was lovely to spend a few hours walking around the park, getting fresh air in the middle of a huge city, taking in the delightful gardens and visiting the many museums. The Olympic Museum and Baekje Museum are well worth a visit! I am not usually a fan of parks but the Seoul Olympic Park is one of the loveliest places I have ever visited overseas.

Most museums are closed on Mondays, so having unexpected art moment really made my visit to this park special.  The sculpture garden is extensive--pictures do not do it justice.
