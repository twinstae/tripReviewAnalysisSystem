0,3.0,nothing special,just a tall building in a residential area. not worth visiting in itself. the restaurants and attractions are mostly intended for families in the area., February 2020
1,4.0,City Views,"Had lunch on 59th floor, outstanding views of the the city. Enjoyable buffet lunch well presented, professional staff.", October 2019
2,3.0,Great Views,"Stopped by here as it was along my travel plans for the day.  The building is striking from the outside and in... a little pricy for the overall experience.  The exterior elevators are quite thrilling for one with a great respect for heights.  It was a bit of a challenge to find the actual entrance to the building/activities and it was quite crowded on the weekend I visited.  As mentioned, it was along the travel route I had planned for the day and thought it would be nice to visit the Art Gallery (happened be to the show ""With My Friends"" geared toward children and how children interact with their environment - actually quite charming).  Not sure that I would go back unless there were a particular event to attend or art show to see.  City views are available in other locations...", April 2019
3,3.0,Just a tall building,"I don't know what I was expecting but this was just another modern building. The area is great though, so if you are in a position like me where you're travel buddy wants to visit, you can combine it with a nice walk by the river :)", August 2018
4,3.0,63 City,Took a 10-15 mins walk from the Yeoinaru station. First went to the aquarium but the place as smaller than expected. I would say not worth the price if you are not interested in sea creatures. The observatory and art museum was worth the time there as it overlooks the whole of S.Korea.Tip: I left 63 city around 7 and walked past the Han river towards Yeoinaru station and there was a great view there since there was a great sunset., July 2019
5,4.0,Worth a visit for the view,"This site is listed as a should do, so we did. We travelled by Metro to the Yeoinaru Station and took a ten minute walk to the building.The visit to the building is free when you purchase a Seoul Tourist Pass, otherwise entry to the 60th Floor viewing floor plus Art Gallery, and the aquarium in the basement costs 25000₩, I think.It was very quiet on the Tuesday of our visit. No crowds and we certainly enjoyed the view of the city and the river Han plus the numerous bridges crossing the river. The Art Gallery on that 60th Floor is interesting and ""easy to interpret"", with several focus on young children.The aquarium in the basement was not huge, with a good collection of sea life. The mermaid swim show at the end of the walk in the aquarium certainly got a lot of the children's attention.", March 2019
6,4.0,63 CITY= 100 SCORE,"63 building in the highest building in my country, so people want to visit there, and after they visited, they always shocked because of the hight of the building. It was awesome!", September 2018
7,4.0,Worth the views,"It overlooks the Hangang river and as the name suggests, it has 63 floors - and is the tallest and most recognisable building in Korea. It is not just a tall building and houses attractions such as Seaworld and an observatory on the 60th floor.", August 2018
8,5.0,Great view on the top.,You can see Han River from the top.There us an aquarium in the basement. It's not so big but there is a mermaid show., May 2018
9,5.0,Beautiful scene,The night view at here is quite great. it is a wonderful experience stay in 63 tower for 1~2 hour. Very convenient to visit there by taking the subway or bus. You can go there at night when after dinner., February 2018
10,4.0,Worth one time visit,I visited twice. The view from the top is great. You can see Namsan Tower in the distance and the new Lotte Tower. That helps you realize how big Seoul is. Huge. It's an iconic building in Seoul so one should visit while in Seoul., July 2017
11,3.0,for a rainy day,"I didn't now what to expect. There are not so much inside to do. We've been there on a rainy day. The galleria was closed. We visited the aquarium aqua planet which is nice and artifully displayed but it is more for small children. The aquarium is relatively small. Shops were not very interesting. At sunset, the 63 building is shimmering with the sun (this was not at this rainy day). So it is better to see it from outside.", July 2016
12,5.0,Great view of the city,Seoul is a huge city and this building allows for a great view of it along the river. This is well worth a visit., April 2017
13,3.0,Tall building,"63 Square is one of the tallest buildings in Seoul. It is also a cultural complex. It has 63 Art observatory, museum, and Aqua Planet. The night view of Seoul from 63 Art, the highest gallery in the world is outstanding!!63 Art Galleria.... 13,000 won. Aqua Planet 23,000 won. Since 90% of the museum in Seoul are FREE and minimal admission fee for the palace. For the galleria and aquarium... 13,000 won and 23, 000 won is a little bit pricey. Subway Line 5, Yeouinaru Station, Exit 4", October 2016
14,4.0,The tallest building in Korea,"This is a very popular atraction in Seoul. It has an elevator which takes you to the roof, where there is an observatory. The city view from there is wonderful. At the ground floor there are many restaurants with good options of different kind of food.", February 2017
15,3.0,Nothing special,Nothing really special at 63 City. There is a Duty Free Shop there where tourists were brought there by tourist buses., February 2017
16,5.0,Awesome View!,"We went up to the top of the 63 building only to find buildings, buildings, and more buildings. There were so much condominiums and it was a bit hazy due to the smog but it was a really awesome view. There is a small coffee shop so you can rest a bit. There is also a small gift shop to buy little gifts.", June 2016
17,5.0,63,"Amazing view from the top. Restaurants, acuariums, museums and shopping are available inside the building.", September 2016
18,2.0,Not much to do.,"Saw 63 City from a lot of Korean shows so I came here after a walk at Yeouido Hangang Park. Besides from the tall design of the building, there is not a lot to do. There is an aquarium and an art museum inside. Tickets are quite expensive and its crowded with tourists, especially tourists from China. Seriously don't recommend people to come.", August 2016
19,3.0,Only outside,"I visited 63 building only outside...în the park, so i can not Tell so much about this spot. It was the tallest building în Asia în 1985", July 2016
20,4.0,Amazing 63 building city,"This is the first time I travel to Korea and The 63 city buildings was the best with beautiful yellow glass roof, You can relax on the top with a cup of coffee & enjoy amazing view wit winding river HAN and bridges in sunny day.The yellow color of the glass is the feature of the building. 63 building (63 City) is the corporate headquarters of Hanwha, located on the Yeoido island, Seoul capital. 63 building is the world's highest that covered by gold glass.", May 2016
21,1.0,Absolute waste of time,Everything is closed down. Waste of time. Going to other places of attraction would be more worthwhile, June 2016
22,4.0,Nice view from here,"View from this tallest and most recognized building in Korea is much better than fromthe Seoul Tower.Enter via 63 Square, they do charge an entrance fee of 13000 won for adult...There is a cafe where you can sit, relax and enjoy the view.", June 2016
23,5.0,Nice n clean,"I ve stayed in south korea fir two years, i learned korean a bit ,and there was my best period of life. People are so friendly and kind .a very fast growing nation.clean cities and minds. The culture has a big backgroud. I would looove to visit again", July 2015
24,4.0,Fantastic 63building,"Let me tell you about 63building in Seoul.63building is 249m high. You can go there by train, bus and taxi. You can take 6B or 10B bus from Incheon International Airport. It leaves every 1hour. If you want go by train. You can go underground airport than you'll find train station. But you'll arrive there after 1hour.The 63building started to be built in 1985. It took a long time. But many people visit 63building. Because there are many shopping malls, cinemas, an aquarium, restaurants and company offices. But there many expensive stores.What you especially want to see is the fantastic view. It is on the top floor. But it's not cheap too! It is 13,000won. If you go to the top floor you'll see Yeouido city. Also you can go to the Thrill Deck corner. The floor is made of transparent glass. Opposite there is Art Mall corner. There many pictures also the pictures change once a month. I think 63building is very good but it is a little expensive.", December 2015
25,5.0,Amazing Views,"Amazing views from the 63 Building.  Parking was plentiful, people were friendly, lots to see and do but the main attraction is the views from the top, well worth the stay for the sunset and city lights illumination.", August 2015
26,4.0,Cityscape of Seoul,"I always have a soft spot for observation decks and 63 Building's was no exception. Admission was ₩13,000 and it is best to go up in the evening and on a clear day the views will be magnificent. The glass elevator was fun to be in, even though it only lasts for a minute or so.", April 2016
27,3.0,A decently tall building.,"I would rather go to Seoul N Tower which is an outdoor activity while walking up a sprawling park.  I have been to 63 City a few times and have eaten at the Chinese restaurant at the top from reservation only as well.  The tower is located in the middle of Seoul, but best visited after a rainy day else visibility suffers.  It is a great location to see the city and you can see a decent amount around.  I would go with tempered expectations just because of smog and occasional dirty windows.", January 2016
28,3.0,Nice view of Seoul,"I took some friends here who were visiting Seoul for the first time back in January during my extended stay in Seoul. Because the 63 Building/Hanhwa building was featured in a lot of Korean dramas/shows, they had wanted to visit, but I wasn't too impressed. You do get a nice view of Seoul (some of my friends told us after that we should have gone at night, but I'm not sure about the hours or the discrepancy in price), but I just don't think it was worth the admission fee.", January 2016
29,5.0,Popular places to enjoy a magnificent view of Seoul City,"The 63 Buiding (63 City) is located near Hangang Park and  not to forget, Yeoido Park and the well-known television broadcast stations KBS & MBC. From 63 City to Itaewon, it takes not so long for the distance via subway but it way too far walking down from Hangang Park to the subway station. If you are not that prefers to walk, then you could take a cab. But, believe me…it was fascinating to spend times walking since Hangang Park was ready to accompany your way along to the station. I mean, it worth a fresh air even it was afternoon! There are a few different attractions in th building. The main attractions are an aquarium, wax museum, IMAX cinema the lookout on the 60th floor which also doubles as an art museum. You can buy combination tickets to see multiple attractions for a discount. As is so often the case in Korea, you have to grab a queue ticket. Don't be a nonga (like me) and wait in the non-existent line. lol.", May 2015
30,5.0,Who doesn't love views?!,"After walking the River, I saw this building and remembered it from many Korean variety shows I had watched in the past. They offer a foreigner discount which was a pleasant surprise. There was no wait, which was even better. Once we got to the top, it offered great views. No complaints on my end.", September 2015
31,4.0,A great view of Seoul,"As great as the view from N Seoul Tower may be, what you really want to do it view Seoul from the observation floor in 63 Building. The N Seoul Tower provides a great focal point in the city skyline which makes for a better view and better pictures.", January 2015
32,4.0,A wonderful view of Seoul,"Stunning view of the city. It was a nice afternoon spent visiting attractions and browsing the other shops. Eric Kayser bakery is excellent, I particularly liked the green tea cakes.", May 2015
33,4.0,Best view of all of Seoul,"Went there yesterday evening before it got dark.  Just a very slight haze, but we could see probably 15 miles.  The view of the city is just incredible.  I don't know how much the admission was since it was paid buy our tour director, but it was well worth it.", September 2015
34,4.0,"A must-see, but price conscious visitors might take a pass.","The building itself is now fairly old, over 30 years, but it hasn't really aged at old, thanks to its cladding that make it look like it's a gold lingot (especially when the sun in low in the sky). Even more so than for foreigners, it is a veritable symbol of Korea, as one Asia's tallest building, and defined Korea as a rapidly emerging country. The attractions Inside are various (art gallery with observatory, wax museum, aquarium, shopping mall). Apart from the observation deck, the other attractions are ""only"" decent, and there are better wax museums in Northern Seoul - Grévin, better malls in many places -IFC mall also in Yeouido, Times Square...- and better aquarium at COEX or at the Lotte World Tower. So the main reason to visit would be going all the wait up to get a great view, and also enjoy a nice art collection. The view is indeed really nice, and without a doubt the best spot for a panoramic view of the Han river. However, it does come in pricey (20 000 KRW I believe), which might not warrant the price for some people. If you want to come up an equally expensive tower, Namsan Tower might be a bit more iconic, and climbing some mountains in Seoul (Inwangsan, Bugaksan, Gwanaksan, Guryongsan, Namsan) might give you an almost as beautiful spectacle as well, but for free.", October 2014
35,3.0,A normal visit,"I was excited to visit this place when I reached Korea, since a lot of hype from friends of mine, when i got there, this place was just average but since there is a wax museum there and I never went to any Wax museum before, I tot i should give it a bit of points. Other than that, this place is just ok to me.", October 2014
36,4.0,63 Building,"So I've been wanting to see this building in person since I played Sim City when I was a kid.  I'm so happy I finally saw it.  After having lunch at a little bbq joint in Yeouido, I decided to walk to this building.  It was pretty far, it took me about 40 minutes to get here.  Maybe I'm just slow at walking.  But it was well worth it.A lot of stuff inside.  They even have a museum at the top floor.  The stuff in the museum is just ok for me.  I paid for the amazing views not the artwork to be honest.  It was well worth the visit.", April 2015
37,3.0,"Multi attraction building, great views.","This is confusing, so stick with me on this.  The 63 Building also called 63 City is really the Hanhwa Building.  There are no flashing lights advertising 63 Building, so do not look for it.  You will see Hanhwa Building at the top so head in that direction.  You will not see anything referring to ""63"" until you are right in front of the building.  You can take line 1, 5 or 9.  I took line 5, purple line since I was in the Jongno/Insadong area.  I got off at Yeouinaru station, walked for 30 minutes along the waterfront park.  Only after reaching the building and picking up a brochure, did I realize there is a free shuttle from the subway stop.  This is not stated in the guide book.  So, my pain is your gain.  Get off at this same station, take exit 4 and there should be a shuttle stop there.  Line 1, dark blue, get off at Daebang station, exit 6.  This building has an observatory deck which is also an art gallery, Sea World Aquarium, Wax Museum, and IMAX Theater.  I really only wanted the observatory, which was 12,000 won.  Go in main entrance, take a sharp left and walk all the way to the ticket counter.  The views are spectacular, and me and my friend were the only 2 people there and then an Asian family of 4 joined us.  We were the only people there, so I do not think it is that popular, but if you like a non busy uncluttered space you will like it here.  The main floor has many restaurants and coffee shops.  If your time is limited, I personally like N Seoul Tower better.  See my review about it.", June 2015
38,3.0,Nice view,"My wife cousin treated us to a day here, nice little tour great view and the Buffett was super food from everywhere.", March 2014
39,4.0,The best!,We had walked more that 20mins getting to 63 Building from the Daebang Station. Missed our chance to enjoy the IMEX Theatre however the Skydeck is absolutely magnificient. The view of the city and Hangang River at night is simply magnificient., October 2014
40,4.0,Great view - Fish Market is close,"Enjoyed taking in the view up top at 63 City - the art gallery was also a nice touch while seeing the city landscape.  The Fish Market is close, but not walkable - you'll need to take a cab to get there and across the highway.", February 2014
41,4.0,"Art Gallery, 60th floor.","There's not enough information in English, so it may be complicated for those who can't speak basic Korean. I thought we would be able to go to the 63th floor, but apparently we can only reach the 60th one. The view at night is nice, but the internal illumination interferes with the photos so maybe it would be better to visit in the afternoon.", August 2014
42,3.0,Korean Holiday,It was ok but not too impressive.  We went to the sky art gallery that gave access to there observatory.  I wasn't very impressed with the art gallery but the view of Seoul from the bldg observation was impressive. Not bad for $12 per person., August 2014
43,4.0,The View,Going there was accidental. After the river cruise we walked because we couldnt get a taxi. We could see it right away from afar. Decided to go up and have dinner in a japanese restaurant on the top floor. We didnt regret that we went up cause the view was great. We could see the lights around the city. Its the view that sold us out., November 2013
44,3.0,"Multi-attraction destination, good for kids","Only because we are renting an apartment in Yeouido did we decide to walk to 63 Building. We purchased a 'big 3' ticket which for us included the observation deck, aquarium and IMAX (show on king penguins). Purchase your tickets by Visa and you get an extra 40% off the rate (70000 v 42000won for two adults). Observation deck OK with the art display - views would be much better on clear days; IMAX was good but the headset for translation into English did not work (but easy to follow anyway); and the aquarium was unworthy and in desperate need of updates to their animal enclosures.  There are regular shuttle buses but we decided to walk the 10 minutes to Yeouinaru station.", August 2014
45,2.0,Skip everything except the art museum.,"I quite enjoy scenic views, and this is a good one.  But as with many other cityscapes, it comes with a steep price.  Unless you've got upwards of 200+ dollars to shell out for a dinner, I would recommend going to the ""art museum"" which I feel is mostly an excuse to charge people 12,000 won to go to the top of the building.  The people looking at the art were outnumbered by people looking at the view 10 to 1.I have been to the ""Walking on the Clouds"" restaurant at the top, as well as the Imax, and both were expensive and nice for special occasions, but nothing blew me away. I would call this place a tourist trap, but most of the visitors are actually Korean, so it might be more of a status thing.", January 2014
46,4.0,Awesome view--skip the aquarium.,"The sky art view was amazing, especially at night.  The aquarium was just depressing...too small, not quite clean.  I felt so sad for the animals, especially the penguins.  Note:  the wine bar on the 59th floor is beautiful, and very romantic...but it is by the (pricey) bottle only.  Not a place for budget travelers.", May 2014
47,3.0,Best visited during sunset,"The building appears to be golden in colour at afternoon till the sunset.  Not very far from the building there is a recreational area or garden of some sort where a lot of people (family, friends and couple) do actually just relax and play something. From the garden, you can approach the building you will pass by a bridge and will need to cross the road. There are a lot of things inside the building (wax museum and stuff) bit we did not go to any of those.", July 2013
48,3.0,Symbol of Yeuido,"Once the tallest building in Asia, it offers a lot of things to do, aquarium, wax museum, IMAX theater and observation hall at the top. They offer discount if we purchase at least 2 attractions. Beautiful scenery of Hangang Park can be seen from the top and Seoul generally as well. But its aquarium is quite disappointing, not worth money spent.", April 2014
49,4.0,Good place to watch the sunset and get a birds eye view of Seoul,"There are a few different attractions in Building 63. The main attractions are an aquarium, wax museum, IMAX cinema the lookout on the 60th floor which also doubles as an art museum. You can buy combination tickets to see multiple attractions for a discount. If you are a foreigner/tourist, you can get a further $5 discount on the ticket price. During the day, we hired bikes in Hangang park and then went to City 63 (aka Building 63) in the afternoon to watch the sunset. You can find loads of pictures and some more info on my blog here. http://gdaykorea.blogspot.kr/2014/05/seoul-hanggang-park-bicycles-building-63.html", May 2014
50,3.0,Expensive but many things to do.,"There is an aquarium, wax museum and observation tower (with art gallery) in this building. It is pretty expensive as far as things go in Seoul and we found other areas were better than this one. The COEX aquarium was more extensive and the views from N. Seoul Tower were much better. If you are in the area it isn't a terrible idea to go but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit as there are other places with better suited to your needs.", May 2013
51,5.0,Multi purpose attraction,"They have the observation deck, wax museum, art museum, aquarium and seasonal attraction for kids there. There is a small, pricey shopping area and nice food court. Mainly, the view from the building and nearby park is why I went. There is a free shuttle to the building from nearby stations for free.", October 2013
52,4.0,Pretty cool views,"Went to the top since it was on my bucket list and supposedly one of the top landmarks of Seoul. Really useful shuttle bus service going to and from there (via different tube stations), which was free! Loved the views from the top, was really amazing and kind of worth the 10,000 KRW to get up. Queues weren't long, and there were some great art exhibitions going on to.", October 2013
53,5.0,Very nice tower with decent activities,"This tower should be preferred to the N tower. While it is not as high, the top floor is much quitter and also propose some nice modern art exhibition. The other activities proposed in the tower (aquarium, wax museum) is nice specially for families and is the weather is not that great.", October 2013
54,5.0,Spectacular view of Seoul from the top,"Spectacular visit of Seoul from the observation deck. This is one of the towers from which to witness that skyscraper view of the city. The building contains other attractions as well including an aquarium, shopping, and fine dining.", November 2012
55,4.0,Great place to get a city view,"I only went here to get up to the observation level on the top floor and it's well worth it - I was fortunate it was a bright, clear day so the views along the river and over the city were very good and you get a good appreciation of the layout of Seoul and the observation deck was well maintained and the windows clear.  The art exhibition that's also up there seems a bit of an afterthought.  I got there at 10am on a sunday morning and had the place to myself with no queues to buy tickets or travel up in the lift.  It's not the easiest place to get to via the underground - about a 15 min walk from the nearest station.", September 2013
56,3.0,Nothing except a brilliant city view.,"Pretty much a pointless mall/building that has a very good view of Seoul.Paid 11000 KRW to go up to the observatory. At that moment, they had an art exhibition at the observatory so one can browse works of arts while admiring the city view. Amazing view of the Han river and downtown buildings can be seen. Best time to go would be around 6-7pm for sunset.There is also a small cafe and a souvenir shop.A note is that the building is a little far from nearby subway stations (Yeouido & Yeouinaru) but the building provides free shuttles leaving every 20 or so minutes to and fro.", August 2013
57,3.0,One of the highlights of Seoul,"63 City Seoul is one of the places were you can have a complete view of the city. When in the top floor, the funny activity is finding the distance from Seoul to several cities in the world, such as NY or London.", September 2012
58,1.0,Terrible place,"In this building many excursions. But the queues waiting for them long. People are waiting for two or three hours to get only to the Aquarium. We bought a ticket to the observation deck 11000 KRW. Standing 40 minutes in the queue, to rise to the top. And then forty minutes waiting to come down. Spend time waiting in the queue is awful.", August 2013
59,3.0,Worth a visit if you are new to Seoul,"When it was inaugurated I was a kid then and it was a huge sensation. I remember being amazed by the Imax theater. The last time I was there I was with my wife who was visiting Seoul for the first time and we had a good time.I guess if you are new to Seoul, it’s a nice place to visit once. Although you can view all Seoul from the top floors, is not that spectacular because all you see is a sea of buildings. By the way everything there is highly priced.", August 2012
60,4.0,If you like tall buildings...,"You may go there if you want to view all Seoul from height. There are also aquarium, cinema, wax museum in 63 city. But if you travelled much and saw many attractions all over the world 63 city will not be impressed you very much.", February 2013
61,5.0,Beautiful!,Best way to view the city! Go at night! Beautiful! 360 view of the city!$11 per person. Give yourself a good couple of hours to enjoy it., February 2013
62,4.0,Fun City,"63 City has a very good setup for visitors of all age.  Its aquarium, wax museum, sky walk and art gallery are all worth it.  Arrive half-hour before sunset to see the exterior golden colored building and while you complete your tours to the aquarium and wax museum it is dark and a marvel to witness how Seoul looks like at night.Not to miss.", November 2012
63,3.0,Went to the Wax Museum and did the aquarium a few years back.,It's worth visiting if you really don't have much planned for the day in Seoul.  Lots of coffee shops and a restaurant on one of the top floors., November 2012
64,4.0,GREAT VIEW,"There is an art gallery in the last story of the bulding (63, thats where the name comes from). Fair paintings, that are outshine by the best view of the han river, preferably at night, Be aware that there is a 20USD$ charge fir using the elevator.", December 2012
65,4.0,Elegant Skyscraper in Southern Seoul,"The 63 building is a rather well-designed building on Yeouido island. The gold exterior is radiant during sunny days, and the structure is now a familiar locale on the Han river. As far as modern skyscapers, the 63 building does not stand out for its height, at least internationally. Visitors can either enjoy the building from the river, as river cruises are widely available in Seoul. Or visitors that are generally more interested in skyscapers and ""view points"" can travel to Yeouido, and see the 63 building up close. There is a pleasant (small) sculpure garden on the ground level. The fee to see views are a bit expensive, but on clear days, the view is nice. Keep in mind that while the view is enjoyable, it cannot be compared to Hong Kong or New York.", March 2012
66,4.0,Very good view over the city,"Take the lift up (12.00 Won), and get a glimpse on how large Seoul really is. You have a very nice view from there. But do not pay money for the wax museum, the figures there are very bad, not comparable to Madam Toussauds! The aquarium is ok.", November 2012
67,5.0,"Best View in Seoul, better than N-Tower evem","63 City sounded interesting and I wanted to see Seoul by night and take some nice pics and it certainly didn't disappoint. The nearest train station was a wee way away but it took ages to get there by taxi, I think because we exited on the wrong side of the railway lines. Entrance was 10,000won from memory, we decided to skip the aquarium, wax museum etc and just go up the tower, and I think we made the right choice, The views were amazing, you could see great distances in all directions, and looking out over the river at all the lights was beautiful. Got some good pics too, but it took some effort to avoid all the glare/reflections in the glass.", October 2012
68,4.0,Nice views of Seoul at night,Visit this museum/restaurant at night for great views of the lights of the city. Ongoing art exhibits and other items of interest are present on the 63rd floor viewing deck., October 2012
69,4.0,A worthwhile attraction,"We came here to enjoy the view from the observation deck and we weren’t disappointed. The Han River and Hangang Park down below make a spectacular backdrop to the city of Seoul that stretches for miles in every direction as far as the eye can see.To get here from Gangnam, we took the train to Yeouido on the sparkling new No 9 train line from Sinnonyeon station. We had hoped to catch the free shuttle bus from Yeouido station to Bldg 63 but there’s no way you’ll find it unless you know where it leaves from and the timetable. So we ended up catching a taxi from the station which was fine and cost only 4,000 won. Some kindly locals pointed us in the right direction, hailed a cab for us and told the cab driver where to take us. All over Seoul we found people helpful, polite and friendly who will their best to help you if they can understand what you want.Building 63 ground floor has a food court and a host of stand-alone restaurants and cafes and the usual array of little shops selling cosmetics, souvenirs, knick knacks and the like.After cruising around for a few minutes we headed to the ticket counter and bought ticks for 11,000 won each for the viewing platform and gave the other attractions like the aquarium, a miss.The lift that takes you to the observation deck is on the outside of the building and is made of glass, so going up 60 floors is an experience in itself, as you peer out and watch things on the ground getting smaller and smaller. I’m not a great one for heights and number of people in the lift made me slightly claustrophobic so I was glad when we reached the top, although it was a fairly quick trip, may be only a minute or three.But of course it’s worth it as the view from level 60 is spectacular. And having been up the New Seoul Tower on the other side of the river, this gave us a different perspective on this vast city. Up top, in addition to the viewing, you can see a display of paintings by local artists known as “Sky Art”. There is also the obligatory cafe and souvenir kiosk. We spent about 40 minutes up there and then took the scary lift back down again.Getting back to Yeouido station was a breeze as this time we were easily able to locate the free shuttle bus which was waiting outside the main entrance.This is a worthwhile experience on your visit to Seoul and if you’re staying nearby I wouldn’t miss it.", April 2012
70,4.0,Highest art gallery in the world & a Sea World,"We came by taxi and waited as attractions didn't  open til 10 a.m.Our admission to the Sky Art and Observation Deck was about $11 US per person.  Along with the art work on display, there is a small counter where you can purchase beverages - we had cold lattes due to the heat/humidity of August.  There are viewers to see the sights of Seoul below.  Not as impressive/romantic  as Umeda Sky Building  or Eiffel Tower or Empire State Building but same concept.", August 2012
71,5.0,Magic view on night Seoul,It is famous building with overview place in 60th floor. You may see almost whole Seoul. I recommend everyone to go there in the evening. Seoul is especially beautiful from overview place in the nights when it is colored by bright lights., August 2012
72,4.0,Experience Sky Art!,"We wanted to view Seoul from the top, so we headed to the 63 Building in Yeouido. It's quite a walk from the closest subway station. 1. Tip 1: We should have taken the shuttle -- look for it.Buying tickets is centralized. Get a priority number (if I recall correctly, the sign said something like Waiting Number). When your priority number is flashed on the screen, proceed to the ticket counter to buy a ticket -- you have a choice of just going to the top (pick Sky Art), or getting bundles (aquarium, etc.)2. Tip 2: Take a seat after getting your priority number. There are benches near the ticket booth.The elevator going up is really fast! It will take you straight to Sky Art. If you don't dawdle or buy food/drinks/souvenirs/go to the toilet, you can be in and out in 20 minutes. But try and savor the experience. The view is what you'd expect, but the art is pretty cool. They have interactive art for the kids. Can't take pictures of the art, but you can of the view.There are lots of places to eat in 63 City, a movie theater and other things you'd see in a mall. Fun with friends or family.", May 2012
73,4.0,worth going but with a charge,overlooking a nice park facing the hanghong riverthere is a wax museum and an aquarium.BUT i am interested in the panoromic view at the 63th floor of the building.nice taking pictures!It is close to the famous seafood market, April 2012
74,4.0,Good Aquarium and Viewing Tower,Good day trip.  Three in one package is a good deal. The buffet there is amazing though over priced., January 2012
75,5.0,Building 63,There's so much to do in this building.  We went close to Halloween and the wax museum had a haunted hall that was very good!, October 2011
76,3.0,I recommend Seoul Tower instead.,"We went to Building 63 today. I like the area it's in - the river is right there and a park runs along this.  It's true - there's a walk from any subway station, but on a pretty day - it's not horrible.  We used Line 5, Station Yeouinaru, Exit 4.  It took maybe 15 minutes to walk to Building 63. I had high expectations, but wasn't really impressed with the building overall.  There were long lines to all the first floor attractions (i.e. Seaworld) - long lines to even get tickets to those attractions, then long lines to get into the attractions.  Additionally, there wasn't much in the way of directions on how exactly to navigate the building to get up to the top floors.  The brochures were limited in the scope of information - so we were sort of wandering.  It doesn't seem like they've figured out how to effectively make Building 63 a 'tourist attraction' - if that makes sense.  I must give credit to the staff though - their English was great and they were kind and polite as they pointed us along.  We elected to skip the first floor attractions, and went up to one of the top floor restaurants (Walk in the Cloud).  An amazing view, but the prices were astronomical. I think this would be a good choice for drinks in the evening to see the city lights.  Or for a very special occassion, as the set menu looks promising.For us though, in the middle of the day - we went back to the first floor and lunched at Teriyaki.  I highly recommend this place - great Japanese foods, extensive menu and the prices were very reasonable.  I think, if you're looking to see the city from the sky - Seoul Tower is a better choice.  It's a well oiled machine in comparison to Building 63.", March 2012
77,3.0,Go for the views but NOT the aquarium,"The views from the 60th floor are great, but make sure you choose a sunny or clear day to go or you'll be wasting your time. The Artworld at the top now houses some modern art by some young Korean artists and isn't too bad. Go early (it opens at 10am) to avoid the innevitable queues.However whatever you do avoid the terrible, cruel aquarium. It's upsetting to see how badly the walrus, penguins and otters are treated and made even worse by the fact that none of the locals seem bothered and think the place is marvellous. The aquarium should be closed down tommorow and the owners prosecuted for animal cruelty.", March 2012
78,3.0,Well worth a visit!,I found the views from the top of the building to be far better than the much vaunted N-Seoul Tower across the city.   It is also far less crowded and contains an art gallery on the observation floor!I also visited the aquarium on a rainy day and found it to be a satisfactory way to spend a few hours!63 City has the added attraction that it is located next to Namji Hangang Park and the Han River Tourist Ferries which are both enjoyable places especially on a sunny Spring or Fall day!, April 2011
79,5.0,"Suitable for young kids and teenagers at Seaworld, wax museum and breathtaking view from 63 storey!!!","You can spend one whole day at 63 City and will never get bored.  My family and I take the subway to Yeouido Station.  After getting info from the info counter at the station, we take a shuttle bus to 63 City.  To save cost, you can buy the package tickets (30,000 won per head) and select 3 places of interests you want to go.  We chose Sky Art, Seaworld and Wax Museum.  You can visit the Sky Art around 5pm, then you can enjoy both day and night scene of Seoul City at 63 storey high building.  It is an awesome sight especially during the night.  Seeing Han River from the top of the building is an enjoyable and relaxing time!!  At the Sea World, you can see all species of fishes and reptiles and some birds. ..  There are many performances at the Sea World where you can see the feeding of penguins, fishes, etc.  There is ballet dancing in the aquarium where you can see the dacer perform dancing in the water.  At the wax meseum, you can take pictures with all prominent figures, such as Obama, Tiger Woods, Mortzart, Beethoven and etc.  The most frightening and scary part is going through the dark tunnel where you will experience the heart in your mouth...Dracula and all hollewen sights...  We also watch the 5-D movies where you have to pay additional 5000 won each.  This place is suitable for young kids and teenagers.....so please do not miss this place when you are in Seoul.", December 2011
80,3.0,Nice view of Seoul at night - the highest art gallery in the world,"I visited 63 Building with a group of friends from my exchange university. The building has lots of things going on including shopping and plenty of attractions to fill your entire day. We visited the aquarium, wax museum, and art gallery. We used a group discount to lower the cost as well. The wax museum was our first stop and had lots of things to see (plenty of photo opportunities). I took a photo with a Barack Obama wax model and also managed to snap one with my favorite artist: Vincent van Gogh. The wax models look eerily realistic and there was a mini-haunted house that gave me goosebumps from how real the models looked. Inside the museum we also rode a 4D ride that makes you feel like you're inside a movie - it was a little more for it, but a fun excursion nevertheless.After the museum we headed over to the aquarium which had plenty of fish - I was really surprised how they could cram so much sea life into a small aquarium. The kids inside the aquarium were enthralled with the sea animal shows and there was plenty of interesting fish to look at.The food court at the 63 building has some average food choices - we decided to have some Lotteria before heading on our way to our final stop - the art gallery. The ride up the art gallery spooked me a little when I noticed just how high we were going. The top floor had excellent night views of Seoul and is a nice photo opportunity for those with advanced cameras. The art exhibit itself was small, but still enough to warrant a visit. Overall, the 63 Building is certainly worth a look if you have some time to spend in Seoul, but I wouldn't put it at the top of my priority list.", October 2011
