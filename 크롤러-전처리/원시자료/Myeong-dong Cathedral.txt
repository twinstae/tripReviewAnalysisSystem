Conveniently located in the heart of Myeongdong , this church has a very nice brick structure with a lot of trees and gardens as well as a nice souvenir shop.  I attended Palm Sunday mass here and it was very solemn.  My only comment is that the pews do not have kneeling pads so its quite diffiult to kneel during the mass.
