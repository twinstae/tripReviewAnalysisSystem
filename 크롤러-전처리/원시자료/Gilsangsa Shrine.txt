0,3.0,Not worth the detour,"Recent and modest temple, notwithstanding the impressive gate and some nice landscaping. I was somewhat disappointed, also because it took a while to get there, as the place is not directly accessible via the metro - it's a 25 mn walk from the nearest subway station.", January 2020
1,5.0,Hidden gem in the middle of the city,"You will find this temple on the way to the Korean Furniture Museum, one of the popular tourist sites. But this is not the place you should just pass by.     When I visited the place was a month before Buddha’s birthday, so there were many lanterns hanging. The colorful lanterns", April 2019
2,5.0,Buddhist Temple off the beaten track,On our walk back to the subway after a visit to the Korea Furniture Museum we stopped in to wander around the grounds of this Buddhist temple located in Seonguk-dong.  The temple was founded only recently in 1997 yet we imagined it had been here for much longer.  Entering in, April 2018
3,4.0,Fascinating history,"It's certainly very new as far as temples go, but I wanted to see it due to its unique history. It seems the website describes the property as a former restaurant, which it technically was, but in reality it was a famed gisaeng house where back door politics would regularly take", April 2016
4,4.0,"Quiet, beautiful temple","This temple is nestled in a very quiet, wealthy neighbourhood in Seongbuk-ro. It is a little bit of a walk from the main street, although there is a shuttle service bus from one of the bus stops along the street. We went a little late in the evening so there weren’t many people.", April 2016
5,5.0,Impressice,Well worth walking by and checking out this impressive temple.  Very well restored and maintained.  Nicely perched in Seongbuk.  While it is lovely - I would not make this a dedicated special trip - but incorporate it into your tour and walks around the area, September 2015
6,3.0,A very quiet Buddhist temple complex,"This temple is located in a strikingly quiet neighbourhood of Seoul and it seems to get very few visitors, at least in winter, so visiting it was a very relaxing experience. The compound includes at least as many modern buildings as traditional ones, which did temper my already", February 2013
