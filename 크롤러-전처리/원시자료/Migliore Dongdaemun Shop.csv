0,4.0,Designer quality and styles at great prices,"Hundreds of vendors with a huge diversity of product in one compact building on multiple floors. Great place to outfit a wardrobe for a makeover, new career, or new season.", September 2019
1,1.0,"China  + 1, South Korea -1","avoid at all cost... rude sellers, overpriced goods .. sellers at the basement 1 and 2 are very rude to tourists .. one shop even looked at us from head to foot and told us rudely that they cannot sell to us, ""Do not touch original""... i was just asking the price of the item on display even though the item covered in plastic (glad wrap)... he took the shoe from my hand that what was on display ( a very good valentino open top rock stud sneakers for men knock off)... sellers will first google the price of the LEGIT item before telling you their price... PASS on this mall... cheaper to buy in europe for Legit items that are on sale than deal with RUDE Migliore knock off sellers!!..... imho sellers in so called ""silk markets"" in mainland China are nicer to deal with...", September 2019
2,4.0,Typical shopping mall,"Migliore mall is located in Dongdaemun, with many shops selling fashion apparel, accessories, shoes, bags etc targeting the younger generation, especially women. Prices are reasonable. This is one of the newer malls in Dongdaemun.", June 2019
3,1.0,Aggressive sellers,Do not bother wasting your time in this mall especially in the males section . Aggressive sellers trying to coerce you to buy super overpriced goods with nasty attitude when you donâ€™t buy from them, May 2019
4,1.0,"Very pressurizing, especially male section","Every store in the male section is hawking for customers. They are onto you the moment you step off the escalator. Prices are definitely way above what you can get at other areas like hongdae shopping street. I saw the same top costing 10000 Won at hongdae but the seller quoted me 38000 won at migliore. by the way, almost all items do not have price tags there so be wary. Materials also aren't of good quality to fit the prices - even after you factor in a discount of about 20-30%. They'll ask you to give them a price. But it doesnt matter because the original price is already marked up way above what you can get outside. It's essentially another trick up their sleeves. Know your materials and do not fall to pressure. Otherwise, shop at other areas like myeongdong, Sinchon or hongdae where they are a lot friendlier and they have prices which you can see.", April 2019
5,3.0,Similar to Bangkok Platinum Mall,"We went in early morning. Hence, there was no crowd. The layout is similar to Bangkok Platinum mall. Every level selling specific stuffs. Lower level for apparel, higher level for bags, shoes, accessories, luggage. Quite a good place to shop if you know what you want.", April 2019
6,3.0,Cramped and crowded store,"This is a large store opposite the Dongdaemun Design Plaza and Lotte Fitin shopping mall. The store was packed with visitors and the space inside it was pretty tight so not a particularly enjoyable experience. However, visitors can find all kinds of clothing for both adults and children as well as lots of accessories.My advice is to only visit this place if you really want to find cheap clothes and accessories and have the time to spare, but please do not bring children here as it is too crowded and very hectic. The aisles are narrow and people are always pushing their way past you.", July 2018
7,3.0,Good place to shop but some of the seller attitude can be better.,"Place at location down town, just opposite DDP design center. Good for shopping open from 10:30am to 04:30amSome of the seller may give you feelings like "" you don't buy, you don't touch"".", June 2018
8,3.0,Not as nice as before,We have been to Migliore on previous trips and found this place had somewhat deteriorated. There were more empty units and the range seemed to be become lesser. The men's section on the 4th floor was quite scary as the sellers were more aggressive. There were a lot less shoppers as compared to 2 years ago in the same mall. The prices didnt seem as cheap anymore. We bought much lesser this time round. Will try the malls beside in the dongdaemun area the next time., May 2018
9,3.0,Cluttered with small shops,"Dongdaemun area is a shopping paradise and Migliore is a multi storey store in the midst of it. Itâ€™s crowded with little shops organised around a theme eg womenâ€™s, childrenâ€™s etc, but thatâ€™s about all there is in organisation! All the stores sell varied and sometimes duplicative items but if you persist, there are some good buys to be had.", March 2018
10,1.0,Super Bad Experience ,"super bad experience here. sellers were super rude and unfriendly. this place is also filled with youngsters that are rude. i went to one of the shop and was browsing at the dresses and i was holding onto one that caught my eye. i took less than five minutes and then the seller snatched the dress away from me and asked if i wanted it so i replied that i still want to look around. she then began to mumble and say that i kept saying i want to look look look. hence, i decided to put the dress back and walk off with my sister. NEVER DID I EXPECT THAT she actually chased us and tapped on my sister's shoulder hardly and scolded: 'u look look look, no buy, no say thank you! NO MANNERS!' and then stomped off. i was so shocked by her rude and odd behaviour as we were already at another store that's quite far away! didn't expect this odd woman in her fifties (the store owner) to actually chase a customer to scold him/her. i guess she ALWAYS does this to customers as another seller actually told us to continue looking at the clothes (at another store) and ignore her. what i'm trying to say is, customers have customer rights. it doesn't mean that after we look we HAVE to buy.", January 2018
11,4.0,A shoppers paradise,Located very close to dongdaemun subway is Migliore which opens at 10.30 in morning and is open till 4.30 am. So one can visit this place in midnight. Itâ€™s a must visit place for anyone wanting to buy clothes / accessories or bags. Both male and female clothes available. Shopping tip: remember to bargain - they easily reduce price by 30-40%.Try and shop maximum things from single shop to get maximum discounts, October 2017
12,4.0,Nicer clothes ,"Migliore is very similar to Hello APM but stall keepers a slightly more snottier. They may have more range in nice styles of clothes but prices are a little higher above 30,000â‚©.Their B1 floor is stocked full of adorable baby and toddler clothes. A shopping heaven for parents!", November 2017
13,4.0,cool Shop,"It is nice department"" stores like this in Dongdaemun .It is not luxury like lotte mall .But, they have good deal like good cloths , luggage,Sojourners and etc.Take care you should bargain or you will buy product in high price.The staff nice and speak English.We visit this mall many times and it one of the favorite my wife.I will come back", August 2017
14,3.0,Shop,"There are a lot of ""department"" stores like this in Dongdaemun. They dont speak english, some stuff is overpriced", March 2017
15,1.0,"If you cannot speak Korean, don't go there","The sellers act like gang. When you look around the place, they keep bothering you to look at it and buy it.Also the price was way higher than my expectation. When I mentioned that is too expensive, (this is kind of routine) they ask me back ""how much you expected?"" no matter how much you mentioned, they said they cannot offer that price. When I gave up to buy it, they talked to my back.This was not just one place. I experienced every single place.I strongly recommended (warned) you. Don't go this place. This will ruin your mood and image of Korea.", July 2017
16,1.0,Don't go to 4th floor of this place!! Very rude!!,"I went to here with my friends and most of the sellers on 4th floor who are selling men's clothes were not nice at all. We nicely asked the price of the goods, and after we were told the price, we said it was too expensive. They asked back, how much do we want, and after we gave our number, they responded rudely and said ""don't come back again."" They also speak in Korean to other sellers which I believe talking something about us. It's just very funny for us, if they are not ready to be bargained, then don't ask us to bargain.I'd prefer to shop at other places but not this 4th floor.", May 2017
17,3.0,Honeymoon @ Migliore,This is a lower end shopping mall as compared to nearby Doota.This shopping mall is opened until 5am.Mostly clothing for men and women but more women's clothing.Price of the items can be further reduced by 10% - 30%.There is no changing room to try the clothing. Only wrap a scarf around you while changing. Try figuring out yourself ðŸ˜€The upper floors are for mens. They tend to be very pushy and aggressive. So be careful. There is no restaurant but a couple of shops selling beverages., February 2017
18,5.0,Ideal place for shopaholics,"This is not only the best shopping destination I have encountered, but also the only review where I have given an 'excellent' rating. As someone who loves shopping, this place is absolutely fantastic. Seoul is known for its shopping, and from this mall I can clearly see why. The mall has cleverly separated its departments into different levels. They know their main demographic is the ladies, so 4/6 (or 3/5) of its floors are for women's fashion/ accessories. They only allocated one floor for the men and another for the children. Basically, the gave one floor each to the men and children and gave the remaining to the people whom appreciates good fashion and shopping: the ladies.The clothes they sell there have good quality and are really in style with the Korean fashion trends. Trying on clothes that I have bought makes me feel like I have just stepped into the Korean Drama realm. This is an especially great place to bring your teenage daughter, for their merchandise is really aimed at the younger crowd. The clothes here have really nice colors and cool designs, with texts and even cartoon characters and caricatures, something I don't see very fashionable for the older crowd.The quality of their merchandise are very good and pleasant to touch. However, that contributes to its higher than average prices. It definitely is more cost efficient to shop here than shop at places like Gucci or Burberry (and lets be real here the clothes they sell here are so much prettier than what you get there), which is why I love it here so much. The prices can make you feel a little overwhelmed if you are used to shopping at flea markets and bazaars (I mostly shop at Bugis Street), but for a good quality and pretty jacket that cost 50000 won is quite acceptable if you ask me. You will definitely need to pour out some cash if you are going to shop here seriously, but its not as if you need to make it rain with money here like you do when buying things from designer label brands. And at the end of the day what you pay is what you get, and who really wants things of bad quality because of its low prices these days anyway? I left the building with a huge recycling bag filled with my purchases that could easily weigh up to to a few kilos (I had a very hard and tiring night after leaving and going back to my hotel with all that weight I had to bring back.) I guess one bad thing about the place is its ventilation. We came during winter time and taking off our coats would mean we had to carry it throughout our shopping spree, and that would greatly inconvenience us. Wow the heater was unforgiving! We were practically sweating! The first time we did so in Korea! The sellers could have also been a little more polite, especially at the men's department where their behavior towards us made us a little uncomfortable. The other sellers were much better to us, even when we rejected what they were selling, they just gave us a little puppy pout like in those girls in KDramas, which did not make me feel guilty nor threatened, unlike the shops in China (I forgot which city) where a rejection meant an instant sour face. Finally, a sitting area would be nice, because we certainly needed to take a break from all that shopping, and we did not. Our legs were swelling, and my mother refused to put down the heavy bag of purchases on the floor while we shopped, so you can image how tired we were. To sum it up, this is a paradise to spend money at. I came here twice during my stay in South Korea and this was easily the best part of it.", December 2016
19,4.0,A mini Platinum Mall (BKK) in Korea,"The first thing that came to mind in the layout and products was Platinum Mall in Bangkok, but this is a scaled down version and prices aren't as cheap as in BKK (natch). Still a nice mall to see wholesale priced clothes (more fashionable) and shoes (sneakers galore) and accessories. Was looking for glitzy sneakers but couldn't find anything with the right look and price. Picked up a couple of accessories but then .... wasn't really in a shopping mood! A good mall to visit especially since stuff was cheaper than in Doota Mall next door.", November 2016
20,3.0,A typical big shopping center of SK,"There are a lot of small shops in a big one, no prices are written, it's the saler that tells you the price. Generally it's quite expensive , but here is the ""game"" : negociation, if you manage it well you can have it for 25% of the first price announced ! (A saler wanted to sell me a shirt for 48 000 won, I got it for 20 000).A good experience to do, but not for me, I prefer to see stable prices.", August 2016
21,2.0,Overpriced goods,"Got coerced into getting a t-shirt for 20,000 won. Saw the same shirt going for much cheaper at Migliore Myeongdong. Don't believe the hype about low prices. I believe prices have risen thanks to the increasing popularity of the place.", July 2016
22,3.0,Not cheap and limited size,"I always heard of must visit dongdaemun when u r in Seoul. Varities of cheap and affordable clothes.. Varities of clothes is true, but not cheap.. And the size is very limited", April 2016
23,4.0,A whole sale fashion mall for ladies and men n toddlers,"There were 5 stories top 2 were men fashions,1st-3rd were mostly women and B1 were babies and toddlers.Don't be afraid to ask for discounts as its a wholesale mall after all. The more pieces u buy the more discount u get.It's opened until pretty late or early in the morning!!", June 2016
24,5.0,Trendy shopping mall,"Love every moment there. They have a sale going on, which was brilliant. There are many different local designers that was featured in that place, and is definitely worth a trip there if you are fashion conscious, or have teenagers in tow.", March 2016
25,4.0,Bought souvenirs!!,Visited this place as it was the part of culture transit tour. Nice place to shop for souvenirs. Bought some key chains and socks. Bargaining is little hard. Prefers cash as some of them do not have POS machines., November 2015
26,3.0,Its alright,"Each mall contains the same style of clothes (small kiosks like), theres so much stall of the same type of collections makes me feel Ive been entering the same shopping mall. Koreans don't have the habit of bargaining so most items you see are pretty fixed unless you can kindly ask for a discount. Theres a lot of nearby skincare shop that are similar to (the body shop, bath and body works etc) which are pretty affordable and dirt cheap compare back in North America.", December 2015
27,3.0,Good but not my taste!,"The whole are in and around is very famous for shopping, again its not a cheap bargain and size is all for tiny people!!", August 2015
28,4.0,so many beautiful things here!,"its easy to go there by bus, or taxi.and when u reach there...its shopping time!so much pretty clothes and others. also when i get there there's a cover dance performances in front of it. yeaay.so dont forget to bring everything u need, to embrace the moment here.if u get tired, there's a coffee shop next to it.", August 2015
29,5.0,Midnight shopping,"OMG despite what people say, (overpriced cheap stuffs etc.), I love the place! For me, all the garments that i bought there were within reasonable price. I stayed at the mall from midnight until 4am. The outside of the mall was still packed with people (koreans mostly) although it was 4am. The coffeebeans was still opened. Taxis everywhere. Or if you don't want to take a cab, wait until the first train at 5.30am. I went there on a Saturday night.", September 2015
30,5.0,Shopping!!,Love shopping here!! I usually spend several days in a row here because there is so much to see and buy!, August 2015
31,5.0,amazing collection,"It was great fun shopping at migliore as you can find everything there shoes, accessories, clothing, bags etc. Trying clothes is a problem there so one should have an idea about their sizes. you get designer and all big brands quality stuff there, i have told all my friends to visit there is a must", April 2015
32,4.0,Great shopping BUT,"But they are very pushy. My mum bought a â‚©225000 ""leather"" jacket but i think we may have been ripped off lol anyway apart from the ultrrraaa ultra pushy retailers shopping is decent. Cash=discount and they speak some english. Affordable shopping though. More for young people.", June 2015
33,3.0,"Not amazing, but not bad for late night shopping","Not a place to go if you want anything somewhat high-end (or low-end..), but is a good place to spend your time at 3am if you are jetlagged and slept for 8 hours of the evening... Come ready to negotiate and never pay the original price. They'll usually drop it 10% before you even ask for a price. Once you've been here, no point in going to any of the other shopping complexes as they are pretty much identical.", June 2015
34,5.0,After Hours Shopping till 5am,"Our favourite place to shop after everything else has closed, cos Migliore opens till 5am in the morning. Although some find this mall a little pricier than others, we are familiar with where our favourite shops are, and keep coming back. Besides, bargaining is allowed, so we have a chance to practise our negotiation skills. There is also 1 shop in the corner near the escalator on one of the mid-floors that sells lots of Korean souvenirs and Kpop memorabilia. The shop owner is very friendly and generous with discounts, so we usually buy all our gifts here.", December 2014
35,4.0,Take Tour Time,"If Bangkok have MBK & Platinum malls, Seoul beats them as Migliore and the one beside it are open till early morning! Lots of selections at fairly good quality and reasonable price. Although haggling for the price can be tricky at times coz others are willing to give addl discounts while others don't. The upper levels for men's wear are more lively as the male sales people are more willing to accommodate price haggling.", October 2014
36,5.0,We came here every night!!,"believe it or not but this is our playing area as shooping start quite late and ends the morning after. This place ectually never sleeps at night and clothes are pertty cheap too. We managed to buy a few pairs worth only KRW5000 ...its heaven for toys too as the underground level is filled with Pororor's toys and they are very high in quality too.However, dont expect to bargain as most shop are fixed price.", June 2014
37,4.0,Shop unil drop here !,Very large building that contains many shops. You can enjoy here for almost the whole day to go through all the shops inside. There are some coffee shops and food shops for you to rest & relax your legs before continue shopping., September 2013
38,3.0,shop after shop with similar items,"One of a few off the open-late malls in dongdaemun, it can be worth the visit if you know exactly what you want.  Be careful because prices are not always cheap (do try to negotiate a lower price) and you may end up buying something for more than a shop on the street.  However, with that said, there are some things you may not be able to see on the streets, so probably make your rounds in the other shopping areas before heading to Migliore (when all the other shops are closed). Also, some shops will give you a discount of thousand won or so, if you pay cash, so make sure to ask!  It's worth a try!", November 2013
39,4.0,Another Must Go mall in DDM,"Located next to APM,Migliore opens till 5am. So every night, DDM is very crowded compared to other shopping areas. It has many levels, each level cater to a different target market. There is also a queue of taxis outside the mall, so no worries even if you shop till after midnight.", April 2014
40,2.0,Overpriced for tourists and definitely must bargain,"Shop owners will quote you with an original price then show you a discounted price. Although they say discounted, but in my opinion they are still rather expensive compared to Bangkok and Hong Kong. The prices they offer are same or higher than online store prices.Don't worry if you don't understand Korean, they will pass you a calculator to ask you to give them a price. Things that are labelled as sale are usually the final price.Do not expect cheap things here. Visit other markets first before this.", June 2013
41,5.0,One of the best places to shop for clothes for nice design at cheap price,"I have travelled to Seoul 5 times over the last 10 years and each time I visit this place to top up or renew my wardrobe. If you like trendy clothes and design, and not fuss with brand names, this is the place for you. Although, a lot of the design are somewhat copies of the major design houses, but most stuff have their own brands.  Some of the stitching can be better however, the materials are generally quite good. Even ones I pay 4 to 5 times the value back home are of more inferior quality. However, remember to negotiate the prices, especially men's clothes because you can quite easily get ripped off otherwise.", December 2012
42,5.0,Bargain!,"The selections are huge, but to get a good deal, you've gotta really bargain for it. If it's not up to your desired price tag, then walk away nicely.", October 2012
43,2.0,Just lots of shops - not for bargain hunters!,"A lot of hype about not much. There are floors and floors of clothes, clothes, clothes and some of the shop owners won't let you try on the clothes, so no point! If you must tick the box, pop in and out and then go to Dongdaemun traditional Market for real bargains, but get there early as this local market shuts at 6pm and after that, only the malls are open.", October 2012
44,4.0,"Good variety, but beware of cut-throats","Note: this review is by my wife. All I did was sit in the food court, eat & drink and read a book. :-)Nice and interesting things to look at for a keen window-shopper. Gotta beware that some sellers try to take advantage of the fact that you're a tourist, evident mostly by buyer's inability to speak Korean. There are also sellers who try to give you a fair deal, and I did get some gifts at reasonably good prices.Need to bargain -- sometimes more when you meet cut-throats. But in two instances when I bought items, I bargained; the second time more than the first time, yet I left feeling I got a good deal.Advice: At the end of the day, the price you pay for the item must be something you're happy with. If not, just walk away. I did so a number of times; but please do it courteously. No need to be acrimonious about it.", September 2012
45,4.0,Need More Time Shopping,"We went to Migliore just to look at the clothes available. The prices are higher than in Manila but from what I saw, the quality seems better and designs can't be found at home either. So I think the prices are reasonable. I can't comment on or compare with other countries as I've not been there.If the items are tagged as SALE, don't haggle anymore as the vendors tend to be grouchy.If not, they usually tell you the original price (example 25000) and they'll automatically tell you the discounted price (they bring it down to 20000). If you ask for more, they go grouchy again. And they will not chase after you if you walk away.Also most clothes (for ladies) are tagged as free-size but most of them seem like for small to medium built people. And some shops don't let you fit the clothes.We only had 1.5hours going around Migliore and was not able to go to the other shopping centers, which was a shame.", September 2012
46,3.0,Simple shopping mall with fashion meant for the young,"Prices are competitive and no bargaining allowed as they are all fixed rates. Fashion not as up market but if you look closer, you may find some gems!", February 2012
47,4.0,Not bad,"The shopping here is good and there's definitely a variety. However, i wouldn't say the stuffs here are cheap for students like me. The shopping is mainly catered for women with only the top floor being a guy's zone. Its definitely a place with many small shops but the orientation of the shops makes it hard for one to keep track where one is going. By the time we finished the first floor, we were getting  lazy to shop the upper floors. hence you can see the reduction in number of people falling with each increasing floors. Maybe it's best to check out other places like gangnam underground shopping before heading here to get the best value for your apparels!", August 2012
48,3.0,"High prices, disappointing variety of accessories","In street markets in Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Singapore, sellers frequently offer creative designs in earrings and pendants at reasonable prices, and they say they bought them in Korea.  So we had great expectations for the accessories floors of Dongdaemun's Migliore Building. We visited at 11 am, just a half hour after they opened, and we could find only one kiosk that sold interesting accessories designs. Prices were higher than in the United States. The shopkeeper would come down about 5%, but that was all--even when we walked away. We felt the same way about shoes (at Migliore and in the Dongdaemun shore market) which were more expensive than at Pay Less Shoes in the U.S.  We found more interesting accessories and women's dresses and blouses in Doota!, and in many cases we were able to negotiate discounts there. In both places, language was more of a problem than in Hong Hong and Chiang Mai, and kiosk owners seemed curt and unfriendly. We did not visit Migliore during past-midnight wholesale hours, so perhaps the ""good stuff"" comes out after midnight. For accessories in Korea, we would rank Namdaemun Market first, Dongdaemun Doota! Second, and Dongdaemun Migliore a distant third. There seemed to be much more interesting accessories in Kowloon's Ladies Market, Bangkok's Platinum Mall, and Chiang Mai's Night Market.  And we felt we could have bought the same Korean accessories in Singapore cheaper than in Migliore Dongdaemun.  We suspect Korean merchants just have high reservation prices for foreigners in the downtown and tourist areas.", June 2012
49,5.0,Korean Fashion Goods. :),"This is where you can get all the latest korean fashion goods!You'll have to bargain at first but if you're a non korean speaker you might have a hard time doing that as the sales people aren't familiar with tourists, just local people. Because the shop owners aren't targeting tourists anyways, it wouldn't be that hard to get the price that you want. The fashion are amazing and good quality. I recommend you not to go to the food court at the top floor but to go to the mall next door DOOTA for food as the food court at Migliore is not as clean and modern (more local). And the stall owners can be very pushy, even to locals. I have been to korea for several years now and every time, I would make time to visit Migliore. One of the best fashion malls to shop in Korea.", June 2011
50,3.0,Reasonably Priced Items.,"Bought myself a pair of shoes, 2 shirts and some souvenirs here. Reasonably priced items and I love the shoes. The clothes are trendy and current. Surely will come again if I ever set my foot here next time.", November 2011
51,3.0,Similar like Bangkok Platinum Mall,"Shop till you drop. It opens from 10 am - 5am (next day)!!! Midnight shopping!You can find loads of fashion apparels. Basement sells baby/toddlers wear. Mid level sells women apparels. Upper level sells men apparels, shoes, bags, accessories.When you come to the men apparels level. You'll find those seller very aggressive yet friendly.. They will greet you ask where you from. And they can speak basic english/mandarin/japanese. You can bargain with them if you purchase more. Its expensive though but I love this place very much. Come here to have a feel of it.", March 2012
52,1.0,Don't waste your time!,"If you are looking for a bargain, this is the wrong place.  Few vendors are sporting enough to negotiate, at most going down by 1,000-2,000 won.  Try to ask for more discounts and you will be shooed off.And worst of all, for the exact same item in other countries (Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, etc who import from Korea) the price is higher in Migliore!  I really don't know what the h*ll is going on - the vendors trying to protect their overseas markets??Better go to the nearby wholesale markets (huge!), or at Myeongdong, Hongdae and Insadong.  Dongdaemun is getting notorious - be warned and stay away!!", March 2012
53,1.0,Be very careful with the vendors!,"My shopping experience turned into a nightmare when my wallet,filled with cash and IDs and credit cards was stolen by one of the vendors!I accidently left my wallet at the one of the shops and came back to get it after i realised that about 30mins later, but they denied seeing my wallet,so i tried to look at other shops but since i was certain that i left it there,i came back again to the same shop and still, they pretend to don't even understand what WALLET is. So we asked help from the Mall's management and immediately looked into the CCTV. The guy was caught red handed!It was clear in the video he took it when i left it in on his table.The security retrieved d wallet fr the guy n said that he didnt understand what i asked of him. Honestly, there really r a lot of HOT guys n girls, but most of them r rude n unfriendly. I am NEVER going back to Seoul EVER again!", July 2011
