0,4.0,Elegant shopping mall,"Although not as opulent as the Shisegae downtown mall, this more modern building has a lot to offer to cater to any shopping or eating need, with many fashionable joints to chose from. Connnected to the mall is the Shisegae duty free, where you can find all sorts of luxury,", January 2020
1,5.0,Shopping hot spot in Gangnam,"One of the best department stores in Seoul, Shinsegae is in a very central location, next to the Express Bus Terminal. It is attached to the JW Marriott hotel, to the underground mall and to more shops in Famille Street. The dept store has everything one can think of, all luxury brands that you can imagine, plus the usual dept store selection. In the basement a grocery store as well as tons of food stalls with all kinds of western and asian food, plus wine and other retail.There is nothing that I can think off that is not there, if not at Shinsegae, then in the underground and above ground malls that are adjacent. Plus plentiful dining options. A great place to go and stroll around plus have a meal.", December 2019
2,4.0,Food court isnt as impressive as gangnum store.,We normally go to the gangnum store near thebus terminal. Thought we would give this one a try as we were staying across the road. The food court was underwhelming compared to the gangnum store. Probably not as big. Still nice however., January 2020
3,4.0,Lots of eateries with cinema .....,Just next to express bus terminal. Many choices for eateries and 12 floors of shopping !  Cinema is within the building too ...., November 2019
4,4.0,Massive shopping complex ,This is a huge department store along with a massive underground shopping area attached to the bus station. There is something here for everyone the only challenge is finding your way around because it’s so big and there are so many shops and ways in and out., November 2018
5,4.0,wow!!,It's a great location with wide variety of choices.Its a very upscale location and prices are on the higher end.Great service!!, September 2018
6,3.0,Exy foodcourt,We went to the food court which was in the basement level of the department store. There was a good variety of foods to sample in the food court but we thought it was a bit on the pricey side. We opted for a bucket of fried chicken – we chose a few different flavours of fried chicken and filled up our bucket half way. It came to about 13000 won., March 2018
7,4.0,Connected To A Nice Mall,"We stayed in the area and came here to kill some time before having to go to the airport. The department store is just kinda whatever, not too different from other higher end department stores I've been to in other parts of Asia. The food court in the basement is worth a look though, there is a little stall selling Japanese cheese tarts (I think the shop is called ""Bake Cheese Tart"", it has a black and yellow logo)  that are phenomenal (the line is usually pretty long but moves fast and they're sooo worth it). There's some other neat stuff there, but definitely try the cheese tarts if that's something that might interest you. If you sign up for their little loyalty card as a foreigner (took like 5min, I thought it was for the whole mall, but it's just for the dept store) you get some little coupons and stuff (like a free Starbucks coffee). I originally thought it was just the department store here and a bunch of other high end shops connected to the Marriott, but it's actually connected to a pretty decent mall. I'm not sure the name of the mall though, it might be several malls interconnected (It might be part of the GoTo mall), but it all connects to the Express Bus Station. There's lots of brand name shops like Uniqlo, Converse, etc, and more food courts as well (and some small restaurants). It's worth checking out if you're in the area,", October 2016
8,4.0,Good mall,"It's food court in the basement is similar to Harrods except better than Harrods..if you want to have a nicer meal,  go up to the 11th floor where there are a few restaurants. We tried the Korean beef hot pot noodles at the Korean restaurant 甜蜜 which was pretty good. The flavor wasn't too overpowering and wasn't spicy,  which is rare for Korea.", May 2017
9,5.0,My favourite department store in Seoul,"Fantastic department store, my favourite in the city.Very nicely designed it is comfortable to shop there and very good product mixFamous for its luxury brands but search for premium products from suppliers ask over the world.Go to food floor to shop or eat there...or just to see the lovely presentation.", April 2017
10,5.0,Neiman/Bergdorf of Seoul,The representation of high end brands at this store reminds me of Neiman Marcus or Bergdorf Goodman.  Great selection...great food court...had dinner on their sit-down restaurant floor., March 2017
11,4.0,High end shopping...,"I don't really shop at departments stores in Korea but often hang out with my family while I'm visiting. Each location might be different but there's about 12~13 floors in total. The basement is the market, food court, bakeries, grab-n-go foods and etc. The 1st floor is cosmetics/accessories and the other floors are divided into women, men, kid's, shoes, bags and etc. The top floors have many different restaurants with variety of cuisines. This mall can get VERY busy on weekends so try to avoid at all cost! (Don't even think about it on holidays...) Lunch rush can be crazy and the wait time for restaurants take forever. You'll see an older crowd during week days since it's the perfect place to hang out during the day with shopping, restaurants and cafes. This mall is so clean and all staff are very polite and helpful. The best time to visit is in the morning if you want to avoid crowds.", April 2016
12,4.0,Mind-Blowing Shopping Experience,"This is my 200th review. I have spent more time in Shinsegae Gangnam than any other place in Seoul other than my in-laws' home, so I am happy that Shinsegae is a milestone review! My family and I have been coming here for at least ten years and have always liked shopping here. With a wave of recent renovations this branch of Shinsegae has become even more impressive in the past two years. It has added a ton of branded kiosks in the basement area that were previously other non-Shinsegae retail and food.My wife's friend, a Korean who has spent a lot of time in NY, recently said ""I can get pretty much anything I want at Shinsegae."" This is more or less true: just in the basement there is a Dean & DeLuca, a wine store, grocery with food from around the world, Japanese rice balls, rectangular pizza cooked Sicilian-style sold by the slice, on and on. There are a few caveats to this astute statement. First, you will not be able to get not exactly what were looking for, something in the neighborhood of what you wanted Second, you will pay a premium, and often a hefty premium, for what you want to buy. For example, a half of an American flank steak cost KRW 60,000. You will pay 20% more here for beer that can also get at your local Seoul convenience store.These semi-negative comments aside, I enjoy visiting Shinsegae Gangnam because: 1) it is at the Gangnam Express Bus Terminal, so it is very convenient for the 3, 7, 9 subway lines2) the basement grocery and food court offer an amazing array of goods from around the world3) the merchandise from the top floor to bottom is top-notch4) it's easier for non-Koreans like me to shop and eat in this complex, as opposed to ""regular Seoul"" where things are not as foreigner-friendlyThe recent renovations have increased the quality of food and merchandise in the complex overall. The new Mega Box movie theater is a welcome addition, and the Famille Station food court has, in effect, moved the Shinsegae 10th floor restaurants to the B1 level. All of these upgrades are part of a Korean retail ""arms race"". There's a similar (and even newer) complex at the COEX location a few Metro stops away.Make no mistake...visiting Seoul Shinsegae is fun and its existence is very welcome. However, it's expensive, and the sprawl of Shinsegae has squeezed out the basement ""shijang"" that makes Seoul special.One more suggestion - do not take a cab or drive here! The 3, 7, 9 lines all stop here, and it's easy to transfer from the 4 (which stops at Myeungdong and Seoul Station) to the 7 at Isu Junction. There's a big parking lot below this massive complex, but it adds stress, aggravation, and time to the whole experience. Recommended.", December 2016

15,4.0,High End Dept Store with amazing fiod,"This is one of the best department store in Seoul, as it's located at the Express Bus Terminal & on top of huge underground shopping center. You can literally shop at this high end store for top notch brand name & grab some traditional food at the bus station of underground shopping area, and decide to shop some more at the discount stores that line the underground shopping center. Also, selection of food items are great at Shinsegae as well!", November 2016
