13,5.0,Great experience,, October 2018
14,4.0,Grevin Museum- Seoul,So you won‚Äôt find much mention of this place among the top attractions in Seoul. However I think it‚Äôs definitely worth the visit if you have time to spare. They have quite a few games/ interactions so it keeps you entertained rather than just walking around the wax figures., June 2018
15,4.0,Great wax museum and rainy day activity,, July 2018
16,4.0,Grevin- Wax Museum,Really nice place to take pictures. I think that this is funny when you come in and you feel like the wax people are real people or that real people is wax people.

17,5.0,Great Experience Not To Be Missed,"Visited Grevin Museum ( Part of Discover Seoul Pass Free Entry) and found this to be the best valued attraction among their list of 21 free attractions.  Apart from the realistic Wax Figures, there were also some Trick Art Photo opportunities as well and some interactive games which you could play too.  Overall a very interesting Museum.

We were able to really take our time and laugh a lot. to see the stars of Kpop and Kdrama is really nice, especially for the fans.", April 2018
23,5.0,Interactive Visit,I booked the ticket through a travel app(Klook). I think I was charged less than lining up. It was a trip i need to fill in the gap between my departure time from incheon. I have about 7 hours before my flight and from the time I checked out. It was fun. The characters are interesting. Some familiar some not but still worth the trip., April 2018
24,4.0,If you wanna see your idols!,"We came in late at this place, like just one hour they weill close so we had to do everything in a rush, but it was a nice tour! It was 4floors full of waxes, just something quite disappointing though was the Lee Min Ho wax, he didn't look like him or any close to him, but the rest were fine especially G-DRAGON! There is also a shop there for you to shop all those Lee Min Hoo, BIGBANG and JGS goodies!", March 2018

27,5.0,Nice place to visit,I enjoyed going to Grevin. The wax figures were very well done and there was a lot to see. They were divided up by theme rooms. I wish I would have went with someone. I could only take selfies which was hard. I recommend taking a friend if you want to take pictures with the figures. I also liked the interactive exhibits., February 2018
28,5.0,Best Wax Museum I've visited ,"It is definitely not the biggest (see MT), but delightfully the funnest wax museum encounter I have hade all over world. We did not intend to go, but given it was across from hotel dropped by, wow. The staging of the scenes adds so much fun, and even though we did not know many of K Celebs,  we quickly figured out their significance. If you have visited other  wax museums, you have to try this one in Seoul and discover a whole new immersive experience :)", February 2018
29,5.0,Nice Detour,We passed by the Grevin on our way back to our hotel. They have celebrities for all ages and lots of interactive games for the young and old. We had a great time with the realistic wax figures. Fun afternoon!, February 2018

31,3.0,Nice place to visit,went to this place and tour starts at level 4. walked out from the elevator and shocked the atmosphere very quiet with deemed lights and you will see famous statue's. Some of the statue doesnt really look like to the celebrity. I was shocked that day where suddenly a staff was standing next to the statue suddenly moving. haha... i think they should say Welcome to Grevin, January 2018
32,5.0,Recommend to visit with friends!,, December 2017
33,5.0,Great to visit with friends,"My friends wanted to take pictures with G-dragon and korean drama stars so we went there and it turned out to be really fun. Of course for foreign Hallyu fans the experience is mostly attractive because of the korean celebreties, but in reality world stars are just as interesting. The fact that you can become a part of everything is also a plus. So many games and activities, in my opinion a very nice way to spend time with friends and get hundreds of picures. Their gift shop has official goods of korean celebrities which is also quite handy for those who is interested in this kind of thing. I would definitely recommend.", January 2018
34,5.0,Nice visit at the Grevin museum.,, December 2017
35,4.0,"Madamme Tussaud for Seoul, South Korea","We went there since our daughter wanted to see the Korean wax museum up close and personal! Not a bad place to visit. You should get the Discover Seoul Pass if you wanted to visit this museum so that it would be worth the money paid. Lots of wax artists or celebrities to see. We have been to the actual Madamme Tussaud in London so it is nothing compared to the real ones. The only different is you can catch the glimpse of the famous Lee Minho. Overall not a waste but then if you just want to visit the museum & pay the entrance fees of KRW18,000 then it is not worth it!", December 2017

However, I've been often told Grevin is one of the best wax museum out of Asia and was recommended by a good friend of mine who has already been there couple times. There were many figures of celerbrities and other public figures, such as Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. I loved how life-like those figures looked.

56,4.0,Interesting trip,"Was hoping for more wax figures of kpop and kdrama celebrities. When I visited alone, there were only 2 other visitors. During the initial phase of the visit, a staff was tasked to follow me around, supposedly to guide me on the rules, etc. However, at one point, when I turned around to look for her, she was nowhere found in sight - she had left without informing me, leaving me alone, surrounded by the wax figures; that really crept me out. It wasn't until a while later when I ran into the other 2 visitors when the ambiance became a lot more pleasant. But overall, it was interesting, and I was glad that I visited.", November 2017
57,4.0,Helicopter Employees...,"Employees kept following me around for almost the entire duration I spent there. It made it really awkward to take photos... If I moved to one side of the room, they slowly walked over, and if I looked at the employees, then they would casually glance elsewhere. Smh, I wasn't going to destroy their museum or take dirty photos. Just a foreigner trying to enjoy the museum like everyone else is. Employees are creepier than the wax figures.", October 2017
