0,5.0,The best typical park in Seoul,"There are several huge parks in Seoul. This is one of them and I think this is the best public park.- The location is quite away from touristic areas. Line #6 Dolgoji Station is the nearest. But, it's also too far to walk. Take #147 bus to get there.- The highlight of the park is the free observatory. It's on the hill and you should get in two funiculars to get there. Walking is better and faster if you're healthy. The view from the open observatory on top is wonderful.- Unlike Seoul Forest, this isn't so distracting with many bicycles.- Many people relaxing in tents.- There are Hanok house, restaurant, deer farm, pond, pavilion, convenience store, cultural center, etc.- Better to visit during cherry blossom or fall foliage.", October 2018
1,5.0,My second favorite park in Seoul ,"What can I say? This place is painfully underrated, why people don't talk enough about it? It's beautiful, every spot in it is beautiful, and I visited it in autumn foliage season and that made it more beautiful than what I expected.It's also an attraction for dogs owners so you will see cute dogs walking around, it's very peaceful very nice very incredible!", November 2017
2,5.0,Underrated and a great place to stroll,"It's amazing that few people talk about this place. It's a big park with a lot of grass, a hanok, a fountain, a museum for kids, a cafe, and the best part: an observation deck where you can get a great shot of Seoul. You can see all over Gangbuk and even see the Lotte Tower Building from a distance. The best thing about this place is that it's free! If you want to park here, it's â‚©300 every 10 minutes. I recommend this place highly especially for families or with your special someone.", August 2017
3,3.0,Ordinary,"To reach Dream Forest, you need to transfer to blue bus from exit 3 of Dolgoji (line 6) station.  It stops right in front of Dream Forest.  Through the main east gate you will see the visitors centre with souvenir shop.  The Design gallery is located on the first floor of the visitors centre.The park has tons of things to do like flying kites, playing balls, picnics and it provides abundant amount of natural vegetation.  The Changnyeongwigung Ancestral Shrine & Bamboo Forest Path along the winding paths are great for taking pictures.  The Lawn Plaza is where concerts & events are held and there was a live band performing when we visited it.", October 2015
4,5.0,Probably the best park in Seoul,"Among the large parks in Seoul (Seoul Forest, Hangang Park, Olympic Park...) Dream Forest is probably the least well known to foreigners. This is mainly due to its location in the fairly underdeveloped Northeastern part of Seoul. If you want to experience Korea as it is for many people, going to Northeastern Seoul for a few hours is a good idea : most of the city's other attractions are located in more affluent neighborhoods, and ""traditional"" or ""nostalgic"" spots (Namdaemun, Insadong) can feel a bit fake and designed for tourists. Going to Dream Forest is the perfect opportunity to walk around these smaller Streets, with smaller shops and fewer foreigners. And going to Dream Forest is the perfect opportunity to do so. The park/forest itself is nothing short of amazing. Located on a hill, it is designed kind of like a ski slope. Start at the top(near the observatory), and gently walk down the park. Each area has its own feeling, and it almost feels like a ""course"" that you can take with different areas. You have the observation tower (check it out, the view is amazing), the art all, the main building with its shops, a huge plaza, then a huge lawn, a pond with traditional Korean buildings, a flower and bamboo park... And on each side of this main course, you have the actual forest where you can go to exercise and enjoy the nature even more. Another great thing about the park is that more than any other one in Korea, it's very family friendly, so you'll see a lot of locals playing with balls, R/C car, kite, or playing badminton, while others will be picnicing or taking a nap. Definitely one of Seoul's hidden treasure.", April 2015
