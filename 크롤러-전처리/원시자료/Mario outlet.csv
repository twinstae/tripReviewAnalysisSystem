0,3.0,Not a must to visit,"Easy to get here by Gasan Digital Complex station. A short walk of perhaps 5 mins.It's mostly the local korea brands in here without those international branded brands. Good to visit this place if you have time to spare and not a must. Can't really figure out how the pricing works here. Sometimes, there are additional discount off the tag on items we bought. Spent half a day here and we didn't buy much either.We got quite a good deal of 50% at the North Face over at the nearby Lotte outlet.", May 2019
1,4.0,A lot of shops,There are few malls around that area and it is easily accessible by subway. The Lotte mall also nearby but a bit more expensive. Worth to drop by., December 2018
2,3.0,Outlet?,It’s my first visit. But not many brand shops without few big brand. Price also was not outlet price., November 2018
3,4.0,Much better and bigger place to shop,3 buildings for you to shop. Lotte factory outlet building is just next door. Don’t waste time there., December 2018
4,5.0,"Basically if you plan to shop in Korea, come here first","Compared to the other places around, I find Mario to be the be the best in terms of coverage and price. It's a bit crowded but that's to be expected. There're a total of 3 buildings connected. The price is the same as the Lotte outlet next door, but Mario has more brand and choices.I recommend spending at least 3 hrs+ here to hunt for the best deal.", December 2018
5,3.0,Good for Korean Brands,"I was disappointed because I thought I could find some western brands here such as Coach, Gucci, Prada among others but this outlet mall mostly has Korean Brands. The shoes options such as adidas and nike weren't also as extensive.", June 2018
6,4.0,shopping,"travel very easy to go, more more shop and more hawkers area (product cheaper than Hong Kong, good quality)", February 2018
7,2.0,Pass,"Brands are mid-range or parochial, prices are not impressive and it is comparable in both price and selection to the Hyundai department store across the street. Doesn't feel like a real value proposition- if you want cheap stick to underground malls/street markets. Neighbourhood is boring and out of the way to boot. Nah.", March 2018
8,4.0,Must visit for shopaholic,"Location is near if compared to outlets in paju. Price is little more expensive if compared than paju and the collection is not as large as ones in paju but price wise and time wise it is better to shop here.By the time we get there, we got free car parking. I think it is because some technical error of the operator. But still nice!Oh. And there is lotte outlet too nearby, right next to mario outlet.", January 2018
9,4.0,Many items. ,Tons to choose from a lot of great clothing decently priced not too much money and it's really conveniently close to the subway In addition there are good restaurants and there is the movie theaters., October 2015
10,5.0,Many clothes,"If you need clothes and discount, come there... there are a lot of stands of many brands, you can negociate a discount to buy all you need", October 2015
11,1.0,Nothing to buy,"Maybe it's a bad time to come where the place is stocked with mostly thick and long sleeves. Not particularly trendy clothes or cheap since it is an outlet. For those that are not expecting the usual US standard premium outlets and not looking for any brand names, maybe it's worth coming since there are a few buildings of such outlets linked to each other.", September 2015
12,4.0,nice outlet - fun,"it was nice- there are 3 separate building that connect which contain many clothes stores for all ages and styles. many sales which can bring clothes down to $6/7 (when I went) . there are restaurants too, including a buffet called Ashley that i love. be sure to check out the ""mall's picks"" area which contains the best limited time sales!", August 2015
13,3.0,Huge shopping complex,"massive shopping mall, lots to buy. There are food outlets too to stop and grab a bite. Prices are slightly cheaper, but look out for sales, can get good bargains.", November 2014
