0,5.0,"beautifully done, fascinating, and educational","to be honest, i wasn’t expecting to be as impressed as i was with the museum, but i am so glad that we paid it a visit in the middle of our trip to the theme park, and i would highly recommend others to do the same.  my personal favourite is the miniature zone in the last part", September 2019
1,5.0,Worth a visit. Give it a try. ,"One may think that it’s going to be boring visiting museum while in Lotte World. You can’t be more wrong. The museum is extremely well done. From pre-historic to the latest dynasty and the modern day - you can learn so much. The life size exhibits are animated and some have narration in different language of your choice. They have really nice replica of the historical buildings, villages, temples, palaces and people way of life. Even the miniature have expressions on their face.   After visiting some of the major attractions such as the seokguram, Gyeongju, and the palaces in Seoul. This scale down summary of all places added more to our understanding. I conclude don’t miss it. Give it a try.", September 2019
2,5.0,Pleasant surprise - definitely recommended,"Came to Lotte World for the rides and attractions - didn't even give the Folk Museum a passing thought until my dad mentioned that it was included in our admission ticket. We decided to drop by to have a look around (had no idea what to expect) but it turns out that this museum is an intricately curated collection of both life-sized and miniature models and displays of Korean life throughout the ages. There were moving ""robots"" showing how life was in the olden times (Joseon and Silla dynasty etc) and also replicas of how a typical home would look like in those days - all the way up to the Japanese colonial period. There are even interactive aspects of the visit as they let you try simple and traditional mock-up Korean games. The most impressive part was probably the cavernous room filled with miniature displays of a typical day at the Palace or village.The careful attention to detail was amazing and I could definitely feel that lots of thought and effort went into preparing the exhibitions. It was quite empty when we visited - think this place is a hidden gem and is not to be missed!", September 2019
3,5.0,The hidden sepul,"Really hidden in the Lotte Advanture world If we were not given the offer to pay extra 20,000W we wouldn’t have known about this museum It is really nice in the 3rd floor of the Lotte Advanture world theme park, you can learn a lot about the Korean tradition and also have a panoramic view of the old villages how did the look like , moreover I’ve learned about the 3 old dynasties and emperor of Korea It also have some pottery workshop place where you can learn how to do you pottery work and also paint them , restaurants and souvenir shops were also available Nice and must to do ManalOman", August 2018
4,5.0,A hidden gem!!,"Totally undiscovered place in Seoul!  We really enjoyed this museum. One of the great things about Korean museums (there are so many interesting ones in Seoul) is that they are mostly deserted!  You can really reflect and enjoy the greatness of museums, which meant to be. In my opinion, Korea is still undiscovered:)  The museum is accessible from different subway lines and is inside of the Lotte World. It is located on the third floor. When you arrive at the Jamsil subway station, follow the Lotte World sign and Folk Museum sign will appear. Just follow the sign. If you are not sure, ask the Lotte Adventure theme park employee.  It is worth visiting if you are in Seoul. It costs 5000 won for an adult to enter. You won't regret!", June 2018
5,4.0,Lotte Adventure for Histrory Lover and for Seniors,"While my kids play around Lotte Adventure rides with my wife, i took my senior in laws to this museum. There they enjoyed everything to know about Korean Folk from prehistoric time to modern time. On display are historical clothing, tools, and shelters. We were treated to life size and miniatures dioramas about Korean historical way of life. Displays are extensive and we spent 1 1/2 hours enjoying it. At the end of the displays are shops and restaurants. This is the most memorable Lotte Adventure for my in laws.", March 2018
6,3.0,Go on weekends,Went on a weekday. I think it’s free to entry with Lotte World adventure tickets. Seniors get a discount n children below 3 gets to enter for free. There is performance and activities during the weekends. Do check before u pay to go in., December 2017
7,4.0,A great Korean Folk Museum which deserves more attention -,"Actually, this museum visit was not on my agenda. I was going to see what the 'Lotte World Adventure' was all about. Since I did not want to do all these attraction I walk around and saw the entrance to this museum. As the price was only Won 5,000 , I decided to have ad look. I great decision. I spend about 1 1/2 hours in there and got a lot of interesting information about Korean history. The displays are very nice and explanations most of the time also in English. I had a great time!!", October 2017
8,5.0,A hidden gem - truly brilliant workmanship.,"I don't know what the cost of entry would be as entry is included when you purchase a day ticket to Lotte World.Before going any further; if history, old bones and artifacts or amazing modelling aren't your thing. Don't bother with this place.However if they are, then this is an iron clad; DO NOT MISS.The sheer sizes is a spin out, the sheer quality of attention to detail, the amount of information provided et al make this a brilliant stop.", August 2017
9,5.0,"Cheap museum, great experience.","We just bought a ticket for the museum and it was very cheap. The museum itself is far bigger than we thought. There was a good bit of information of the different periods and a few interactive parts that we really enjoyed like old games that they used to play and robot-mannequins talking you through a battle or time period. The miniture world was also great to see. It gave us a really good sense of what some of the old markets, temples and castles would have looked like. Really enjoyed and wasn't busy at all. There's also restaurants and a very good gift shop at the end.", June 2017
10,4.0,Educational!,"While roaming around  the theme park, I saw this museum.  It is for free when you buy the ticket to the amusement park.  There were lots of colorful, miniature Korean folks from pre-historic age, stone age up to the time of the different dynasties. Looking at the small scale models, I have learned the rich culture of Korea. They also have several Korean restaurants inside the museum.  I think one of the most beautiful museums I have ever been to.", October 2016

12,4.0,intersting and educational,lots of models of different historical building and artifacts. very informative about the history of korea. plus it's free with lotte world ticket. can't beat that., January 2016
13,4.0,Good Basic History Lesson,"While visiting the amusement park we detoured to visit the museum which was lots of fun.  It came free with our ticket to the park.  It used lots of life size models, replica buildings and miniature displays to give you background and visual. The Miniatures were especially fascinating as the showed Korean life in all seasons from the Emperor down to the kids in a village yard. You were able to see different professions at work and how a wedding was celebrated.  When you walk out you are immediately funneled into the traditional Korean Restaurants.  Take the time to visit drop the kids at the park and spend some time alone with the adults of your group.", June 2016
14,4.0,Interactive and enlightening experience,"The entrance is a little hard to locate but the museum itself is fantastic. I have never been to a museum which has so many miniature re-creations before. Everything is expertly made and you'll be able to learn about the history of South Korea from start to present. There are descriptions in English so do not worry if you are an overseas traveler. Price is 5,000 WON, admission is very cheap and you'll learn a lot here. This place is a MUST visit if you're from out of town.", April 2016
15,5.0,Fun and educational.,Great way to learn more about Korea's history. Museum features life-size wax figures and miniature displays that show traditional village life during the ancient times., December 2015
16,4.0,Great but v cold in January,The museum includes a large outdoor display and a good sized indoor museum with a range of different displays.  We liked the outdoor area best but it would not recommend visiting in winter.  Food options were minimal., January 2016
17,4.0,"Surprisingly good, though not particularly new","This is a surprisingly large, well-done museum that emphasizes tableaux (dioramas) to illustrate various periods of Korean history, particularly those things that demonstrate Korean innovations or dominance.  Most of the exhibits were state-of-the-art in 1990, unchanged since then, but still worth viewing.  They have a huge hall dedicated to miniature versions of royal buildings and processions of the glory days of the Joseon dynasty, apparently intended to show Asian neighbors that Korean civilization was indeed grand in its own right.  If you go to Lotte World amusement park, spend an hour here; or if you are visiting the LotteMart store, spend an hour here, and take the kids, too...they will like it.", January 2016
18,5.0,Educational,"Excellent way to wrap the day after spending hours playing at Lotte World Adventure. It's quiet and nicely mapped out, so as we walked through we get ourselves educated on the way of life in Korea's past. The highlight for us was near the exit, we found a Hanbok rental counter. We had so much fun dressing up, they have a nice selection of Hanboks for adult (male & female), as well as children (boys & girls). It cost KRW10,000 per costume for 20 minutes, and they helped us take as many photos we wanted using our own camera. The couple who owned the place were very sweet and attentive to the kids.", October 2015
19,5.0,Interesting,Is a part of Lotte World. is a nice place where you can see a miniature models about the life of koreean when they has imperial lire. For kids is an interesting place to go. They will enjoy it!, September 2015
20,5.0,A large and comprehensive folk museum,"Part of Lotte World, this folk museum is large and has miniature models depicting life in imperial Korea. You get to learn a lot about Korean culture.", July 2015
21,3.0,Not very authentic but the kids will like it,"It's inside Lotte World in Jamsil so don't expect authenticity. For that you need to be outdoors. Still, if you're interested in tasting some old style Korean food and seeing a snapshot of how things used to be, not a bad way to spend and hour or two during your day at Lotte World. Don't expect it to keep your young kids entertained for long, it's not very big.", November 2014
22,5.0,Love these small people,"I always like looking at these small people and buildings. It makes me feel powerful haha. You know when you are a kid (for generations before the internet age becomes mainstream) u can have just 2 small action figures and play all day with your imagination? well, when i was at this place, my imagination comes alive. I can imagine these small dudes moving. For those who cant imagine, you can appreciate the art of making the small people. It just so cool", June 2014
23,3.0,"Interesting, part of the ticket entrance",Just like any other museum. Nothing spectacular about it. But because we got the Lotte World park ticket and this was inclusive hence we went for it., March 2015
24,5.0,great and informative,the musuem was well laid-out. the miniature village was particularly excellent. showing the history was also quite clever. i learnt a lot., October 2014
25,5.0,a gem of a discovery; totally underrated,"It was so beautifully curated and I was blown away by the efforts put into the miniature models. I ended up spending 2 hours in the museum... longer than I did queuing for the outdoor rides. I give it a 10/10 and recommend it wholeheartedly. To thoroughly enjoy the experience, I would suggest visitors go check out the actual Gyeongbokgung Palace first so that they will be better able to appreciate the models in perspective. An A* attraction.", April 2014
26,4.0,Hidden Gem on Level 3,"Lotte World amusement park and the Ice Rink seem to attract more people, but this museum is a hidden gem on Level 3, accessible only by elevator.
