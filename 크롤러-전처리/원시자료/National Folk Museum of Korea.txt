To be honest I had little desire to come here, but because I stayed nearby and its free, I thought I might as well. The pagoda is a landmark in Seoul and has featured on many a tourist literature. There are some old buildings that have been moved here, as have some Jangseung (totom poles) and there's a small street that illustrates what South Korea was like decades ago. The museum is quite nice and the exhibits are well presented. There's a children's museum which I didn't go to. Contents include general Korean culture and life in the Joseon Dynasty. There is some overlap with other museums and attractions in Seoul. Similar items can be seen at the National Palace Museum which is also on the Gyeongbokgung grounds and the National Museum of Korea. In terms old old hanoks, there is the Namsan Hanok Village.  So the National Folk Museum is like the greatest hits of korean museums in terms of culture. If you don't have the time to visit them all.

114,5.0,Interesting museum of Korean culture,"We came here on a shore excursion after visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace which is next to it.  It is a free museum.  I don't think I saw all of it because our time was limited. It had a nice gift shop, and children's area.  What I saw was life size exhibits detailing the life events of a typical South Korean family such as weddings, 60th birthday, burial as well as clothing, medical practices, etc. The first time a Korean couple in previous times met was at their wedding, although I am sure that is no longer the case. There are very interesting buildings outside as well which you pass on the way to the parking lot.  Very interesting and best of all, it is free.", April 2017

Most things are replicas so unfortunately you won't see too many original pieces. Nonetheless, worth checking out if you're nearby the palace. They did a really good job setting the place up.", November 2017

124,5.0,Fascinating and enjoyable ,"Adjacent to the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Between the extensive palace grounds and this interesting museum, there's plenty to see. One gallery takes you through the traditional Korean life phases and another is organized around the four seasons. If you like seeing what everyday life was like in the old days, you will enjoy these exhibits. Outside there is a small recreated commercial neighborhood from the mid-20th century. Lots to see and very enjoyable.", October 2017
125,4.0,Great museum to get a feel for Korea,"This was an interesting stop that my wife and I checked out after wandering out of the Gyeongbokgung complex.  They had some great outdoor booths exhibiting tea ceremony, traditional meals for the royals, kimchi making, etc.  Inner museum was also interesting - though the scope a little broad since it starts with stone age in Korea!  But the exhibits on the progress and development of Korean civilization and culture were neat.  Worth a visit if you're in that area (and because Gyeongbokgung is definitely worth a visit, you probably will be).", October 2017
126,3.0,"Not a whole lot to see, but it's interesting","This free museum is on the edge of Gyeongbokgung Palace, but you don't need to visit the palace to see the museum.

147,4.0,"Grand entrance, modest exhibit","This is located next to Gyeongbokgung Palace so you might want to stroll through this museum. The exhibits are relatively modest compared to the exterior appearance. What I found interesting is the small outdoor exhibit just next to the museum. It is a small recreation of a Korean town in the late 50's-early 70's. if you lived in Korea during this time, the dabang tea house, manwha bang comic store, etc. will take you back.", July 2017

155,5.0,A great look at Korean life and culture ,We stopped here briefly on a day long guided tour. Our guide left us on our own to explore.
