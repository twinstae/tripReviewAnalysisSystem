3,3.0,Spot for Photo opp and for shops,, December 2019
4,4.0,Iconic university ,The university is impressive. Physically and academically. But many people come here for the shopping. Less crowded then Myeondong but probably same price. The problem as in most Korean shops is that they do not display price and you have to ask for it and become suspicious that the price is not fixed., September 2019
