0,5.0,Great Food! Eat like a local..treat like a star!,, February 2019
1,5.0,Excellent food at extremely good prices,Grilled fish at Dongdaemun Grilled Fish Street. The cutlassfish (top piece) had an amazing natural sweetness and a soft texture.  The Spanish mackerel (bottom piece) had a ‘mackeral’ taste that’s much more fragrant than the usual mackeral we eat in sg. This was so good we came back the next day! And the whole meal for our family of 2 adults and 2 young kids only cost 18000 won!, October 2019
2,3.0,Just grilled fish but it is a local experience,"We (or I should say my wife) were looking for shoe street, went the wrong way and followed the smell. We went into the first restaurant and went upstairs, had to take our shoes off but the floor is clean, just the ceiling is low. If you are not flexible don't go upstairs, you have to sit on the floor and after a while, I couldn't bend my legs. We ordered just one fish for 10,000 won, you get free rice and some Korean side dishes. The best way to eat is to see how the locals eat it and do the same. After they take your order they don't bring it to your table, they bring it up and yell the name of the dish and you raise your hand. The problem is that if you don't know Korean and raise your hand you might get the wrong order. If you eat it before they catch it they might make you pay it. We didn't because it was so busy that they didn't have time to argue with my wife. The grilled fish is OK but nothing spectacular, I would call it local fast food.", October 2019
