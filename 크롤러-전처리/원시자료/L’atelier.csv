0,5.0,Romantic and very informative,"Immersive experience. One can borrow an audio guide in English from the ticket office for free. Make sure you synchronize the audio tape with the shows. Three shows. High quality and affordable souvenirs. Take your time to enjoy - I spent 2 hours there - 3  shows included. Tips: some drawings talk, when out  at floor 11 have a look to the buildings around, phones charging is free at the cafe.Personal opinion: for a more rewarding experience do your homework: read about life and work of the artists.", August 2019
