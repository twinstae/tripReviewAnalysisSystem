1,3.0,Tranquil park in Seoul city centre,"The park is in the city but it is not quite easily accessible. One could travel by subway to Seonyudo station and walk towards the river. There is a walk-bridge (Seonyudo Bridge) right opposite the hospital. It takes about 15 minutes to reach the park. Another way (which I took) is to travel to Hapjeong Station and take Exit 2. Walk to the middle of the nearby busy main road where there is a bus-stop (ID=14-012). Take Bus 603 and drop off at the next bus stop at the front of the park. I had to ask someone as there were two bus-stops and it was quite confusing. Fortunately the person could speak English. The park is not very big and on the weekday it was dead quiet, with just several people walking around. No attractive trees even in autumn. On the Seonyudo walk-bridge, one could get good views of the city. It is not really necessary for foreign tourists to go there.", October 2019
2,4.0,Pretty Island Park,"This is a lovely park, especially with many of itâ€™s beautiful trees turning their foliage to autumn tones. The park has many a good spot for a view or a private picnic. It has lots of shade trees and some great rolling lawn space. You can get a coffee and/or a pizza in the onsite, riverview cafe. It has a couple of performance spaces and it was fun to watch as teenagers gathered in a colourful group (nosebleed high shoes, aqua blue hair and youthful energy) to practise/film some choreographed group dance. Apart from the surrounding waterways there are internal water features and some good walking trails/paths. Parking nearby might be difficult but it didnâ€™t stop numbers of local. And yet the park didnâ€™t feel crowded.", October 2019
3,4.0,Interesting space on Hangang that feels like Gyeonggi,"I visited the park last Saturday. The park itself is not very big and easily walkable though if you have knee problems enter the park from the main gate where the bus stops because the bridge path from the subway has many stairs and the elevator does not work (at least at this time). I enjoyed walking in the bridge but I saw people with bikes struggling up the stairs, as well as the elderly. The park has many great picnic areas and spots, a play ground for the kids and resting areas. There are many maze-like walkable grounds such the bamboo path which I really enjoyed. Lots great opportunities for photography lovers and models alike ðŸ™‚. Great spot for a date, or just to relax. There is a cafe on grounds which I didnâ€™t visit, but if you miss it you wonâ€™t find any drinking water machines and might be dying out if thirst while there, so donâ€™t forget to bring your water bottle with you.", June 2019
4,4.0,Tranquil oasis in the middle of the city,"Seonyudo Park offers a place to escape the hustle and bustle of downtown Seoul - right in the middle of the city - on an island in the Han River. The park offers an interesting and clever transformation of a disused water purification plant into a contemporary botanic garden. As well as the display gardens, there are a number of paths around the island, a cafe, and plenty of places to sit and have a picnic away from crowds. This would be a great place to bring kids for a run around, as there is no traffic, no bicycles and no smoking on the island. Access by walking across the bridge from either Hapjeong Station or Dangsan Station. Alternatively, buses run from both these stations, stopping right on the bridge, at the entrance to the island. There is no cost other than your transport to get there.", May 2019
