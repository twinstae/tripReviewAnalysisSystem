1,3.0,Lacking in Variety and Stores,"Not many stores in the mall. Prob around 50 or so and selling similar stuff. From my understanding there are better underground mall in Seoul. In Myeongdong, stick to the streets good enough. Only visit if you got time to spare. Plus point is perhaps its clean and you wouldn't get lost.", February 2020
2,3.0,Myeongdong Underground shopping Center.,"Must admit that once you exit the subway station, its easy to get sidetracked and browse at the underground mall.  We did a bit of browsing to get an idea what the pricing was for goods and in comparison with the street market, it can be a tad cheaper for socks, makeup, skincare products etc.  Its a great place for browsing during inclement weather.", November 2019

One benefit of shopping underground is to enjoy the air con and avoid the sun, rain or cold above ground.", June 2019
7,5.0,Can't miss it,"Myeongdong is a must to come.   Arriving Myeongdong Station, you will be immediately attracted by the underground shopping center.  Ladies clothing is the best buy as they are all 100% made in Korea.  Korea is famous for Ladies Fashion at affordable price. Of course, the technique of bargain is essential here. Be aware that all known brands here are fakes just as at Itawon in the past.As a matter a fact, there are a number of underground shopping centers at Myeongdong district like Hoehyeon  , Euljiro and Sogong underground shopping centers.

9,2.0,Very market dollar store feel,Area is conveniently located. I heard a lot about this underground shopping Center but I was disappointed when visited. it had a distinct second-hand discount market feel to it. Though the prices were reasonable the look and feel of the area was a major disappointment. I would recommend avoiding the area or making it a low priority on your visit., May 2019
10,3.0,It’s like entering the portal to the Myeongdong Area,We heard about the station actually having retail outlets within the station vicinity (i.e. in the basement area before you emerge from the underground before hitting the street level) There is a treasure trove of about 4-5 shops selling different K-pop merchandise which explains the buzz of activity throughout the day at this station.  My kids spent over an hour poring over all the merchandise on display. The other shops in the station also sell souvenirs but I’d advise you to explore the shops and pop up carts at street level (and that goes for k pop merchandise as well) before deciding what to purchase), December 2018
