I can't tell you how many noisy, annoying tourists we saw! For us, we simply walked the grounds, sat in the shade, and spoke quietly in whispers about the rituals and what we were experiencing.

Even though many of it was newer and lots of concrete I find it didnt distract from the overall beauty. It was in the heart of a,war 60 years ago. Not being completely origonal is accetable to me.
