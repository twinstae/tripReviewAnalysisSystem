1,2.0,A little tense,For me it was a bit disappointing visiting S. Korea. I can feel a bit of tension wherever I would go around the city. The people were not as warm as expected. I don’t know if it was due to a language barrier or they were just not trying to be nice.  I’m Caucasian and my wife is Japanese and at a lot of places we went I didn’t really enjoy myself. It was our first time visiting. But as for me I probably won’t go back again. This is my opinion, April 2019

It is beautiful and whatever is going on inside, the building itself is worth a visit.  There were two exhibitions on when I visited which were both quite interesting but didn't really float my boat - but that's subjective, they were very well presented and worth the time I spent there.

Such a beautiful architectural design that has to be seen in person as photos don’t do it justice.

Oh, and if you play the piano, there are several dotted around the complex. Just sit down and play!", May 2019
94,5.0,Look like a scifi spaceship,The building designed by the wellknown late Zaha Hadid looks like a scifi spaceship landed in the middle of the city aurrounded by shopping malls.

Really very interesting design concept and realization., May 2019
95,3.0,It’s okay,"I may have selected the wrong time to visit so take that into account. First, if you enjoy architecture, the building itself is so unique and beautiful that you can’t go wrong. The building, the artistic statues outside (perhaps the correct term would be sculptures?) are definitely worth seeing in person. The interior is peaceful and calm which contradicts what you might anticipate looking at the space age like exterior. However, there wasn’t a lot going on inside during my particular visit. If you have young kids, they would have fun on I believe it was the third or possibly fourth floor.", May 2019

It's a nice enough building, but we were expecting to see actual design work inside, only to discover they were between exhibits, have no permanent collections, and most people went for the market out front and the children's playland on the top floor. It was very disappointing. Would highly recommend finding out if there's actually something to look at before you go, else just stop by if it's on your way to someplace else. Not worth it to go to Dongdaemun just to look at an empty building.", April 2019

Located on the site of the old baseball stadium the DDP represents a unique piece of building which looks like a huge sculpture in the classic curvy design of Zaha Hadid. Carefully built using BIM modelling the building contains galleries, shops and public areas inside and outside for just viewing and enjoying the atmosphere.

164,3.0,Mixed feelings,"Only visited during the day. Some people say here that it looks great at night. Im sure it would. They pulled down a huge baseball complex to build this amazing shell of a building on this site. Its great looking on the outside, but its the opposite of the Tardis. Big on the outside, virtually nothing on the inside. A couple of unattended sad sort of museums ( with boxes etc just lying around) , a small shopping centre and a train station entry. Must have cost a bomb. Nice curvy lines yes, practical/ useful - not at all. Underutilised. An opportunity lost ( a concert hall it should have been or just a modern stadium etc ) and I love modern architecture, but only if it is functional.", October 2018

Come at about dusk.  The night illumination of this building is stunning.   Inside, one of the ""wings"" has a great collection of design stores that is easy to walk through and enjoyable to browse.  The other ""wings"" have changing exhibitions and shows.  Incredibly easy to get to as it is connected to the subway.
