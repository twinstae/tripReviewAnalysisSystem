0,5.0,The BEST of Korea underground shopping,"A bustling atmosphere, a lot of activity, and a variety of small shops.  Prepare to be overwhelmed on Day 1 and go back for Day 2 with better a bigger shopping bag. Leave plenty of room in your suitcase for Goto Mall shopping!", October 2019
1,4.0,Fun place for women to shop and prices are very reasonable.,"The Goto mall is an underground shopping plaza easily accessible by metro.  The stores primarily cater to women's clothing, shoes, handbags and accessories at a very reasonable price.  On my recent trip to Seoul, I did buy quite a few dresses there and after a few wears and washes, they look good and holding up well.  The dresses I bought were mostly under $10 and are cute and comfortable.  There are a few household item stores and knick knack stores but primarily clothing. Best time to go there would be when it opens (I believe at 9 am- but please do check) as it gets very crowded with time. Overall, I enjoyed my shopping there and cannot complain about any item that I bought. If I return to Seoul, I will definitely make a trip there.", August 2019

Although this is not the biggest underground mall, but i feel that it have the largest variety.

Got some very nice and cute work blouses too. Mostly for females though, shops for male clothing were few and far between.
