0,4.0,Beautiful Seoul skyline,, January 2020
1,4.0,Namsan Seoul Tower,It was a challenge walking from the Myeongdong subway station up the slope to the cable car base station amidst the cold December winter. The cable car ride to the Tower was great but make sure you get a vantage point (ideally facing front) in order to view the great scenery as the cable car brings you up to the tower. The view of the setting sun atop the hill is beautiful. The love padlocks area is overly populated; thanks to all the lovely people. There are restaurants where you can enjoy a good meal while admiring the beautiful view., December 2019

3,4.0,Interesting View,"The Namsam cable car ride provides a very interesting and great view of Seoul.  Its a short ride to the top of the hill but really enjoyed the view, you can take a round trip ride but I think going back is better if you walk down the hill to really enjoy the view for you can stop and take some more pictures.", December 2019
