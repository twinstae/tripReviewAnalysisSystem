0,4.0,Stadium tour was exactly as advertized!,"I have been to dozens of games here, both the national team and FC Seoul, and there is not a bad seat in the place--and on game days, the north end crowd is rockin' it!  I finally took the stadium tour and found it to be as advertised, and expected--it costs 1000W (about $1 US)", January 2020
1,4.0,Sport!!,It was a stadium as all the others but the people made the diffrent. Everyone was nice and friendly and took care of there dirt., October 2018
2,5.0,"Good times, average footy!","Love coming here to watch Seoul FC play. It's super easy to get tickets - just come 30 mins before and get them from the ticket booth. Stadium is huge, with so many empty seats - not to worry! Seats aren't allocated, so you can choose where to sit. I only like to sit behind the goal, to get involved with the songs and fans.To be honest, the quality of football is often pretty poor, but it's still super fun. The attendance was around 15,000 last match, which feels like less because of all the empty seats, but if you're in the section where everyone is singing it's great anyway. Such a novelty to bring as much booze and food into the stands as you like - 'aint like that in England!Anyway, good times. If you're in Seoul for a while, and like football then definitely worth it. Well easy to get to and cheap enough (14,000 원). Up the Seoul!", March 2019
3,3.0,Large stadium but soulless ,Just did the tour of the stadiumWhich was pretty underwhelming. Didn’t even have player jerseys hung up in dressing room. Looked old and worn out inside, November 2018
4,5.0,Great for football fan!,"Went to visit Faetansium where there's some facts and histories on football (and Korean football) but mainly in Korean. But that wouldn't bother much as there're more much interactive VR experience game that you can try! Staff was helpful and spoke good English so he took me to every zone to try the games out!Then off to a FC Seoul game in the afternoon on the same day. Atmosphere outside and around was great, despite the team was underperforming. There's also a fan shop and fan cafe to visit too!", September 2018
5,5.0,2002 World Cup Stadium,"I have been here first time for Turkey vs China football match for World Cup 2002 in Republic of Korea. Turkey : 3 - China: 0   It is a great stadium, convenient transportation and easy watching stadium.", May 2018
6,4.0,Faentasuim,Very interesting place to visit especially Faentasium has interesting stuff that if you're a fan of football you gonna enjoy it, October 2017
7,3.0,Great stadium but terrible team,"The massive majestic world cup stadium is impressive and fit for purpose for this day and age for major football matches, concerts, etc. However if you are planning to watch FC Seoul then I would probably tell you to support the away team. The stadium is rarely full to capacity which is surprising considering the population in Seoul, but the worst thing apart from the team is the supporters. I hate vuvuzelas ever since they where introduced to the football world at the South African World Cup, but also the FC Seoul fans don't seem very interested spending a lot of time on their phones and also they have a cheerleader stand where the fan seats are. Not the kind of things i enjoy at a football match but they do have a very nice fan cafe and shop and the food and drink is very good including the massive pizzas you can get and the beer. The world cup stadium is also very easy to get to using the subway as there is a subway station named after it. Overall it's good to experience it but I wouldn't want to be a FC Seoul fan.", May 2018
8,4.0,Nice stadium. Great food centre.,It's a nice stadium. With a massive super market underneath.  Really good food centre big cheap meals with a massive choice. Very slightly tricky to order. Best to look at pictures in menu/food catalogues.   choose pay at till. Get receipt wait for your number  on screen and go to numbered counter. You won't be disappointed with price and quality. After stadium we followed small river to main river and naval museum. Many riverside parks along the way. Then you can view the national assembly  on the other riverbank and head up to hapjeong station, April 2018
9,4.0,Superb stadium,"South Korea and Japan jointly held the FIFA World Cup football tournament in 2002. The World Cup Stadium in Seoul was built for that tournament. It is shaped like a traditional Korean kite. When viewed from above, it looks like a rectangular shield that is being flown like a kite. It is said that the shape of the stadium represents the flight towards victory. It also combines the hopes of the World Cup games and spirit and traditional culture of the Korean people. South Korea did very well in the tournament and reached the semi finals when they were knocked out by Germany. South Korea did well to knock out Italy in the round of 16 and Spain in the quarter finals. The stadium is a 60,000 seater stadium. It is a very large stadium. There are also large screens on either side of the stadium for people wanting close-up view of the games. There are a variety of parks near the stadium. There are also five theme parks around the stadium including Peace Park, Nanjicheon Park and Noeul Park. There are many beautiful trees - and together with the modern street lights, and lovely fountains - gives you a very attractive place to stroll about. The stadium is open from 9am to 5 pmThere is a World Cup museum (Faentasium) as well. The stadium now has a department store.", August 2017
10,5.0,Expect the unexpected,It was breath-taking when I finally saw this monument. It really stands out and so many activities going on at once. Its not just for soccer/football lovers., June 2017
11,4.0,Great atmosphere ,"We went to watch FC Seoul play a night match as my son is a soccer fan. We all had an amazing time despite a light shower. The fan support was full on for the home team, even with maybe a fifth of the stadium full. Have not experienced the passion before in this size crowd. Food options outside before the game were great as well. An all round fun night.", June 2017
12,5.0,Been there a million times ,"I like this place because its near our house and there are so many different things to do there. Food, shopping, movies, and soccer matches are all fun activities. Surely a must see when you are here", June 2017
13,3.0,Nice place to walking with a family,"I came here because I want to go to Haneul Park and I need to across this stadium to get there. The stadium is really huge but the time that I came, nothing much here.", November 2016
14,4.0,Chill Like A Local,"I initially wanted to climb to the top of Haneul Park. I had read that it's the place to go for a beautiful view of the sunset and Seoul. I ended up in another park (the World Cup Stadium and Park comprises several parks), It's a nice place for taking a walk or biking with family and friends.The stadium was closed when I visited. Next time I'll go, it's because I'm watching a game.", October 2016
15,2.0,Pretty dirty around there.,"I went to an FC Seoul game and the lower bowl was almost full. The pain is that this stadium is sectioned off and you can only enter you specific area.  The other thing I did not like was the food, as there was only 1 tiny gs25 convenience location in our section.", March 2017
16,3.0,Went to the stadium at wrong timing,"We went to the stadium at night and the match was between FC Seoul and Jeonnam Dragons. The guard requested us to pay for the tickets when the match was left with just 8 mins. We ended up talking photo outside the stadium and left soon in order to avoid the 50,000 crowds. A good stadium for photography", November 2016
17,5.0,Visit to World Cup stadium ,There was a gate left open as we walked round so did our own tour. Security was really loose. We even got onto the pitch, November 2016
18,4.0,Cheap stadium visit,"Easy to find - get off at World Cup Stadium stop and at the top of the escalator you will see the Stadium. We walked around and eventually found the entrance.   Unfortunately the museum was closed so we paid the cheap fee of 1,000Won to gain entry into the Stadium. We virtually had the Stadium to ourselves.  There was no guided tour and you are left to wander around yourself which was strange.  We found there was no real flow and we were unsure which areas we could go in and which were restricted.   We were also surprised at the lack of security and bag checking.  Unfortunately there were no matches for our time in Seoul as we would have liked to have experienced the atmosphere.", September 2016
19,5.0,Soccer in Seoul,"Nice stadium. I went for a Seoul-Incheon game. VIP at the booth was just 35,000 KRW with free beer and popcorn during the game. Fans were very passionate. Good experience", April 2016
20,4.0,Pleasant outing and easy to get to,"This is much more than just a soccer stadium. It includes a large shopping mall, a dedicated train station (appropriately named “World Cup Stadium”) and a range of other health, food and entertainment facilities. It’s easy enough to get here on metro train line no 6. Just get off at World Cup Stadium station, a cavernous, modern and clean station with hardly any people. Once you exit it and get to the top of the long escalator, you will see the stadium looming large right in front of you. So far, so good, except that things got a bit tricky for us after that because there’s no signage to point you in the direction of where to buy tickets to enter the stadium.Eventually, we found ourselves wandering around the shopping mall, where we latched onto a helpful gent who spoke a few words of English: I assume that he worked at the mall in some official capacity but not even he knew exactly where the tickets could be bought. After he had consulted with some other official looking people, we were directed to an empty and rather forlorn looking office manned by a solitary sweet Korean lady who seemed delighted to be able to sell us two tickets for the princely sum of 1,000 won each (that’s less than $US1 and about $A1.20). I wouldn’t be surprised if that was the only sale she made all day. There are no tours. With your entry ticket, you just get a short, little brochure telling you about the stadium and you’re pretty much free to wander around at your leisure with no restrictions, for as long as you like. Nothing is out of bounds. Having visited major stadiums in the U.K., where security is tight, this surprised me. At Wembley in London for example and other large stadiums such as Anfield in Liverpool and St James Park in Newcastle, access is strictly controlled and no way would one be allowed to simply wander around on one’s own. The only way you get to see these places is with an organised tour. But I guess this rather casual attitude to security worked to our advantage as it was pretty cool to be able to spend as much time there as we wanted and to mosey around unhindered to see whatever we wanted to. We didn’t encounter a single other visitor for the hour and a half that we were there. The only other people we saw were a group of kindergarten kids kicking a ball around with their teacher. What we couldn’t see, and what we had hoped would be the highlight of the tour, the Museum, was closed for renovations. Or at least that’s what they told us, but with so few visitors, I wonder if it will ever re-open!Despite that disappointment, we enjoyed our trip to Seoul’s World Cup Stadium on a warm sunny day in summer. We walked around on the pitch and the stands took lots of pics, and went into the press room, changing rooms and something that looked like a practice strategy room complete with faux green grass. Everything is well maintained and spotlessly clean.After doing our tour of the stadium, we decamped to the shopping mall, which is right beside it in the same complex. I’m speculating that it may have been built to take advantage of the passing trade during the 2002 World Cup games, but it now seems like a bit of a white elephant. There are rows and rows of shops or little stalls selling overpriced clothing, jewellery, cosmetics etc., although I didn’t hear the sound of too many cash registers jingling. Most shop attendants were standing stiffly to attention at their posts, but looking rather bored. There just weren’t many people there, and even fewer actually buying anything. The impressive food court, though, seemed well patronised by locals, as did the supermarket in the same complex. When it came time for lunch, we struggled to find a place with an English menu or anyone who could even vaguely speak English to explain the offerings to us, so we settled for a little Italian restaurant just outside the food court, which turned out to be pretty disappointing. For the equiv of $A15, all we got was a tiny mushroom salad, two slithers of garlic bread and a cup of hot, black liquid which apparently was supposed to be coffee.In summary, unless you’re a soccer fan, or you have oodles of time to spare, I wouldn’t waste my time coming here. There are more interesting things to do in Seoul. But I had always wanted to see this famous stadium, so for us – me the soccer fan, wife the shopping fan - it was a pleasant, relaxing and enjoyable outing which didn’t take us long to get to, starting from Myeong-dong station on line 4, with a quick changeover at Samgakji to line 6, from where it about nine stops to W.C.S.", June 2016
21,3.0,Nothing special!,This was the venue for the 2002 Korea-Japan World Cup. There was nothing on when we visited and the museum was empty and interactive videos were not available. The stadium is certainly well cared for and very clean but it was not really worth visiting., March 2016
22,3.0,A worn out place that once was great,"The stadium itself is a nice place, but it feels like the place is stuck in 2002 World Cup glory and the time just stops there. The whole stadium is clean due to the Korean standard of hygiene, but there are only few visitors. The museum is empty, the interactive videos and games were shut down. Perhaps it would be a different story if I come when there is a sporting event held there.", December 2015
23,3.0,FC Seoul and AFC Champions league football,"Went there during the week at night to watch FC Seoul in a AFC champions League game. Ticket prices are very reasonable as my friend and I only paid $12.00 USD (14,000 Won) and we sat very close to the pitch. Lines are long to get food or beer but plenty of vendors and restrooms. Make sure not to walk into the World Cup mall when looking for the entrance to buy tickets. Use stairs not the rotunda.", April 2016
24,4.0,FC Seoul ale ale..,"Yes!I was here watching Seoul FC vs Suwon Bluewings FC in this historical former world cup stadium.Having a good football match, friendly-passionate-cheerful supporters, well-managed area, and easy to reach.Felt the vibe of the passionate supporters on my way to the stadium; young-old, man-woman altogether wearing their lovely Red-Black jersey supporting FC Seoul.The Suwon supporters did also.The access to the stadium is easy, you can get subway train or bus.Snacks & drinks were sold in certain booths as well as merchandise items.I got one..yeah!Toilets are available, need to bring your own tissue for backup, during the events.", June 2015
25,4.0,Museum and tour review,"There were no matches on as I went in the middle of winter meaning a lot of the area was closed. The videos were not playing in the museum and I was pretty much the only person there. However, the opportunity to see such a stadium and read about the history for the small price (about 50p, GBP) was massively worth it. I got to stand in the stadium completely alone looking at the pitch and stands, which for a football nerd like me was a beautiful experience. I also got to see the changing rooms, press rooms and the non interactive parts of the museum. Overall well worth a visit, and either in summer for the exhibits or winter for the serene experience.", January 2016
26,3.0,"Worth visiting, but K-League was not that fun","As an amid football (soccer) fan, I have been watching lots of football matches, but I gotta say K-League was not that attractive. When I watched FC Seoul vs Daejeon Citizen here, I saw the difference between a team from a big city and small city, it was like watching a Manchester United vs QPR. However, the stadium was alright as I went there with a friend who was serving the Korean Forces at that time. The environment seemed poor as there was around only 5000 people on attendance.If you would to see a game here, make sure you have a Korean friend who can arrange tickets for you as the system of purchase may be a little bit complex.", April 2015
27,5.0,A sight right next to our house ,"Another great place that is excited to discover. They have great parks and the close by sky park and han river is near as well. The homeplus has lots of fun things to buy, and souvenirs as well.  The 2001 world cup soccer museum is open as well. Also try to go and see Seoul FC play a match", January 2016
28,2.0,Does it Worth Visiting?,"We thought it was a good idea to explore the famous World Cup Stadium while we are in Seoul. The stadium is very accessible via the World Cup Stadium subway station. There is not much to see, however. In such a stadium, you may expect to see a small shop that sells relevant souvenir items. It does not exist here. Instead there is a large department store / supermarket that sell everything and I guess that why people come here.", October 2015
29,3.0,It's ok,As a massive football fan it was a must see place. The person at the door of the museum was extremely kind and helpful regardless of me being the only person to cater to. Overol the facilities are OK. I am happy I went but I would not recommend anyone to go our of their way to see this place., December 2015
30,3.0,Meh,Over it was cool that Japan and Korea co hosted the World Cup in 2002 the stadium itself is outdated or old nothing special. The basketball courts near the stadium and the homeless and restaurants are nearby so that's convenient!@@!, November 2015
31,4.0,It was where World Cup was held in 2002,We passed by Seoul World Cup Stadium on our way to Sky Park and the Stadium was big and it was where World Cup was held in 2002., October 2015
32,4.0,A must see for football nuts,"If you are a football nut like myself, a visit is worthwhile. Easy acces from the metro which stops just at the doorsteps.", August 2015
33,4.0,Nice Facility,"I watched as VIP, and the facility was great. Seoul Stadium has excellent public transportation system too. It has museum, and you can visit it too.", January 2015
34,4.0,Cool to see,"If you are a sports / soccer lover, the World Cup if a cool spot to see.  It is easy to get to from the subway.", January 2015
35,5.0,Great cheap and worthwhile adventure,"Really cheap to get in and then we were allowed to wander. Visited the change rooms, media roomAnd was allowed to wander on the oval!! I could not believe we had so much freedom. Wife and son had a race down one of the wings!! Great morning in Seoul.", July 2015
36,4.0,Great Soccer History,"We went because our daughter is a soccer fanatic. She said it was super neat getting to walk down on the field (behind a roped off area, on carpet).There is a museum area that tells the history of the game in Seoul. Can tour the locker rooms, which she thought was AMAZING!All in all, if you have an interest in soccer, this is a great place to check out!Visited: April 2014", July 2014
37,3.0,checked it out from outside,"We walked a flight of stairs to check out the stadium from outside, nothing much to see. Theres sports shops in the stadium which u can go in. Thats all", June 2014
38,4.0,a good outlet mall in the stadium,We found a very good outlet mall in the stadium. It was a useful place to buy what you want. I recommend you to visit there and find whatever you need., March 2015
39,4.0,A great facility and a good team.,"Enjoyed the excellent stadium and the location. The football was good, and the work rate of a Korean team is phenomenal. Seoul FC make an interesting team, but I sometimes feel as though the crowd response is a little too orchestrated....but this is a Confucian society.", February 2014
40,5.0,my fav place in seoul,"this is definitely my favourite place in seoul, south korea. the stadium is greatthere is also museumyou can enter the museum and stadium by only paying 1000 wontake pictures on the stadiumif you are lucky, the friendly police will allow you to take picture on the field", December 2013
41,4.0,Seoul FC,We went to Seoul World Cup Stadium using subway from Osan. It takes around 1:40 hour but I it was nice to see that stadium built for 2002 World Cup that Brazil won., September 2014
42,4.0,Not really a tourist attraction but nice and well-maintained,"I feel soccer fans would have a better appreciation for this stadium. Although not necessarily a tourist attraction, it is nice to see and go watch a game. Well maintained with easy access from subway.  Has a CGV movie theater, a Homeplus shopping center, and a KFC. Situated nicely around mountains as well.", October 2014
43,3.0,A Stadium with Sentimental Value,"As i heard from the tourist guide, this Stadium are meant so much to the Koreans. This where the place they have their proud of becoming the host for World Cup and where they beat their rival off. During my visit this stadium are empty. Not much visitors only a few guard, maybe because it still in the morning. Walk around the museums, taking picture with the keepers and go to the souvenir shop. Most of the souvenir you can get from anywhere, hehe.", October 2013
44,5.0,Seoul World Cup Stadium - Something for Everyone,"First off, I'm not a big soccer fan and I don't really understand the entire game.  That being said, while on vacation to Korea my brother-in-law took me to my first ever in person soccer game at the Seoul World Cup Stadium.  The facility is huge!!!  Parking was a little difficult and I think he said they charged a higher parking fee for attending a sporting event than other things offered at the stadium (a little more on that later).  The stadium is an open top facility.  If you go to a match during the day, take some sunblock.  You are allowed to bring in food and drinks, so, pack what you like.  I must admit I did enjoy watching live soccer.  It is much better than on television.  It made me want to learn more about the game.  Now for the more...The stadium has a lot more than just a field for soccer.  I also saw available shopping, a wedding hall, and a theater.  There may even be more than that but those are the extras I noticed.I did not visit the shopping area but my wife did.  She said it had a lot to offer.I did notice (accessable from the stadium) a Korean-style open market and supermarket (called a mart) across from the stadium.  I did walk through that a couple of times while out doing fitness walking on the Hangang Park trails (I have a review on that too).  The open market and mart had a lot to offer and just about any food item you may want.I did go to the movie theater twice.  The theater offers 2D, 3D, IMAX, and 4D.  I did a 2D and 4D movie while there.  The 4D experience was my first time and I thought it was pretty awesome.  The movie was Tom Cruise's ""Edge of Tomorrow.""  Since there was a lot of ""action"" in this movie, the 4D experience was quite good.  Rgular movie tickets were on par with US prices.  Since I've never been to a 4D movie in the US, I don't know the rate.  My 4D ticket was $18 US but that was the weekend price.  Ticket prices are more on the weekends at this theater.  Food items are not totally the same as the US but the prices are just as expensive for the same types of items.  So, if you're planning a trip to a soccer match and the weather doesn't fully cooperate, there is more that you can do so the day is not a total waste.  I enjoyed everything I did while there.", June 2014
45,3.0,"Big, well maintained","Part of this stadium complex was some kind of shopping mall and cinema. So, a lot of locals still go there during the weekends and holiday. The entrance to that stadium was affordable. There is nothing much anyway inside of course (its just a stadium), just to snap some pictures. The exhibition room was indeed very informative and inspiring. I truly enjoyed the exhibition room.", July 2013
46,4.0,Border Bash,"I watched South Korea lose to north Korea at the Seoul World Cup Soccer Stadium on 21 July. It was a decent game with the South dominating strikes and time of possession; however, the north made the most of its opportunities and scored on quick fire strikes towards the end of the first half.That said, it was a great place to watch a match. It was easy to get to by subway and you can park there, if you really want to drive. The tickets were incredibly inexpensive: 15,000 won for ""reserved"" seating and 10,000 won for not reserved. There were plenty of seats still available. I bought my tickets two days out and had great seating - not that there appeared to be any bad seats in this gigantic stadium.On the downside, there wasn't much available to eat inside the stadium and they confiscated my Soju on the way in. There is a little food for sale inside, just not much variety of eatery or beverage. I recommend bringing a snickers bar, if that is what you fancy, because you won't find any candy bars inside. You'll be limited to corn dogs, hotdogs, popcorn, some bunto style boxes, kim bop, or chips. At least they were selling Hoegaarten because the chilsing sans Soju wasn't doing it.If there is a sporting event scheduled for this venue, you're in for a treat, just smuggle your treats in with you.", July 2013
47,3.0,Mostly just big,"This is probably more interesting if you are a big soccer fan, but just looking at a big stadium does not hold a lot of appeal for me.  Mostly it is just an empty place with lots of seats.", October 2012
48,5.0,Great stadium to watch a game,"I checked out an F.C. Seoul game here on a chilly, rainy Saturday afternoon in April.  Had a great time.  The sightlines are flawless and the fans made a surprising amount of noise given how few of them there were (only 10,000).  Tickets are super-cheap (about $10) relative to Europe and it's a safe place to take children who like the sport.  Super convenient access with a subway station directly outside the gate.", April 2013
49,4.0,Cant get over they dont use it all the time,"Had a tour here and thought great stadium, was told they never use it much now which is a shame, would have loved to been here to watch a game", July 2012
50,4.0,Spectacular view.,First the stadium is spacious enough and there is state of the art equipment favourable for any event. It is also a beautiful edifice., May 2012
51,4.0,How many world cup stadiums have you been before?,"How many world cup stadiums have you been before? I had to take my chance to visit this stadium. It's impressive that even in a Saturday without any event on stadium, stairs were clean of ice! World Cup 2012 Museum was opened, even that empty, but all complex were with a lot of people jogging, playing basketball.Also impressive that stadium have several rooms for marriage ceremonies. It's not an old complex without usage!", February 2013
52,5.0,Great Stadium,So we visited the Seoul World Cup Stadium as it was only about 2 miles from Hongdae where we were staying. The stadium itself was closed unfortunately as was the fan shop for FC Seoul. THere was however an IMAX cinema underneath the stadium where we went and watched Skyfall for around 8000 won each., November 2012

54,5.0,FC Seoul Matches,"I come here pretty often for the FC Seoul football matches.  It's an excellent venue for soccer matches.  If you're coming for premium food, then forget it.... but that the fact that you're allowed to bring your own food, beverages, and alcohol MORE THAN makes up for it.... in fact,,,,, I think this in the very reason I enjoy this venue.", June 2012
55,5.0,Interesting,Interesting place for a visit. You get to go into the locker rooms etc etc., September 2011
56,3.0,One tenth of my expectations,"Being a die hard fan of Manchester United, and naturally of South Korean footballer, Ji-Sung Park, I was initially excited to visiting the Seoul World Cup Stadium. However, when I arrived:a) the entrance to the Stadium itself was closed -perhaps due to preparations for an upcoming game for this week-;b) I had to make a 270° around the stadium to (finally!) sniff the scent of soccer at the World Cup 2002 museum (btw, the museum's souvenir shop was not only closed but empty)-along the way, I passed by a CGV movie theater, a supermarket, a 'sports center' i.e., gym with pool and sauna, and I saw a sign to a wedding hall (?!) and mall that was located inside the Stadium-.The entrance to the Museum itself was cheap (1000 won): check.It's a pretty small museum but, very neat. You can appreciate both international and Korean soccer history.  The Stadium itself is admirable but the next time I go the Stadium, it'd be to watch a game.", February 2012
57,5.0,"Magnificent stadium, magnificent views","The stadium itself is fantastic - I can't wait to go there for a match. Next to it is a large hill with a zigzag wooden staircase up. Climb up for great views of the stadium, river, and city and marvel at the fact that it used to be a landfill site...", April 2011
