0,5.0,Good for cafe-hopping,Recommended by a local to visit which turns out to be one of the most memorable moment of our trip. The area is made up of connecting alleys which makes you feel like you are in a maze but there's something good waiting for you at every turn. Quaint little shops and cafes, January 2020
1,4.0,Modern and cute fashionable street .,"Lot of shops , cafes but none got seats . Only good for photography and window shopping . Ladies accessories shops are nice though .", December 2019
2,5.0,Cute little place with loads of instagram worthy cafes,"We took a leisurely walk from our hotel near Euljiro 3-ga to Ikseon-dong Hanok Street. It is relatively easy to locate. You can use NaverMap to guide you there as google map doesn’t work well in South Korea. Loads of instagram worthy spots and cafes. There is a nice little hotteok stall near Seine Dessert. Seine Dessert is another cute little cafe with pretty desserts and nice and different European themed interior on each floor. Apart from Hotteok, we tried the pancake at Flipper’s. How was the pancake? Good, but i still prefer Pauline Pancake. Apart from Cafes, there are also bakeries and shops that sells hats, accessories and flowers. You can spend some good 2 hours in this area.", December 2019
3,3.0,"Interesting, but not a must visit","Tiny alley ways lead you to various stores. That's about all there was to this place. It would be a fun place to go as a small group, but as a solo traveler on this date of visit, I didn't find too many places to eat that could accommodate me as the lines were long, but tables are configured for parties of 2 or more. One of the reasons to visit was that it was near other large must visit attractions in Seoul, so taking an hour to swing by here is not that big of a deal.", December 2019
4,4.0,Ikseon-dong Hanok Street,"We were recommended to tour this area by another tourist who was also visiting the Bukchon village.  Surprisingly enough, it was situated relatively close to our hotel.  It is an interesting area filled with trendy shops, eateries and cafes.  Apparently this is one of Seoul's oldest neighborhoods that dates back to the 1920's and many of the traditional old style hanoks have been renovated to house trendy eateries and boutiques.  One can still see traditional roof lines and careful restoration of traditional buildings in this area.   It has narrow laneways and it doesn't take much for the area to get overcrowded.  If you like people watching and visiting trendy shops, you can spend an indefinite period of time here.", November 2019
5,5.0,"Amazing place to be for coffee, shopping, food & IG pics!","Amazing place for coffee, beers, food, shopping & get-together with friends. There are so many instagrammable spots in the small area full of alleys to explore. I can spend the whole day there, having coffee/tea, lunch/dinner & beer in between shopping there! Will  be back there again.", October 2019

7,4.0,Ancient Buildings Full of Modern Details,"Visited this area with my wife one night. I was kind of overwhelmed by how much details, both big and small, there are in this place. While the structures are traditional, everything else certainly are not. There seems to be something to see at every corner. Lots of chic places to eat and shop. I would recommend this place to any young couple on nice evening date.For older folks like myself (37), I thought some of the cafes and restaurants look rather inviting. Unfortunately at the time of my visit, I already had my dinner at Insadong.", October 2019
8,5.0,Favorite place we went in Seoul,"Small warren of alleys that house appealing cafes, restaurants, clothes stores and unique shops.  The buildings have been restored beautifully.  Definitely knew we were somewhere different when walking around.", September 2019
9,4.0,Pretty lanes with interesting shops and cafes,It was crowded on a weekend but we enjoyed walking through the narrow lanes and browsing in the interesting shops housed in traditional korean houses. There were some boutiques selling local design items which caught our eye. One can easily lose track of time inside the shops., August 2019
10,4.0,Alternative to Bukchon hanok village,"Bukchon village is located on a hill with steep streets at some areas while Ikseon-dong is on flat land. There are many shops that sell souvenirs, some cafes and street vendors here. There are some Instagram worthy gems hidden among the streets. Do wander around. There is also a place to get a fortune cookie somewhere in there. It was interesting to see the locals getting the cookies.", July 2019
11,5.0,The current hot place of Seoul,Many of my Korean friends told me that Ikseon-dong is the current go-to hang-out spot of Koreans. There are many unique cafes lined up within the small alley. It gets really crowded during the weekend and evening during the weekdays since this place is so popular. You can check what eat place is selling through SNS especially instagram. Not sure how tourist friendly these place are tho., January 2019
12,5.0,it's an amazing place,"It's really nice. It's an hanok area full of nice local shops, nice restaurants, coffee shops,... and it's really crowded.

14,4.0,Traditional and Fancy but crowded.,"This place turnd hot spot recently for dating and SNS. Every place catch eyes.Restaurants, cafes, bakeries, pubs, accessoiries. All places are good for pictures and as you imagined many people who take pictures.

16,2.0,Unfriendly staff ,Steam buns is fine but French toast doesn't taste good. Crowded with queue. Staff not friendly when asking for ice water., June 2019
17,4.0,Crazily crowded now.,"2 years back, this place was still not so overcrowded.Here we are back again this time and it was mad crowded with people. Impossible to get a photo nicely without all the crowds around. Almost all restaurants/cafe had a queue. How I miss the atmosphere it was, 2 years back.Each shop/cafe/restaurant seems interesting to explore. A cafe filled with flowers was so pretty but the crowd kills the mood of having the leisure afternoon tea session.Tried a topokki restaurant that serves in a flower shape bowl. No idea on this cafe name but it was super yummy and addictive that we went back for another round. And we queued like 30 mins for the 1st round. Well worth the wait! It's not in the main stretch, got to watch around the corners and the doors are painted in green.", May 2019
18,4.0,"Hidden gems, tiny alleys","Ikseon-Dong, just a short walk over from Insa-dong has its charm. This tiny traditional area is full of charm. Tiny alleys lead to hidden gems - colorful souvenir shops, themed cafes, tea houses and restaurants. There are clothes shops too. If you are a photography enthusiast there are many spaces and interior-exterior design spaces waiting to be captured. You will be walking around with a smile, but beware this place is so crowded. When I visited it seemed like half of Korea was there. I didn’t mind too much, other than there were line ups for cafes and restaurants. I will go back again and try to get there before lunch time.", May 2019
19,4.0,Lovely find,Little alleys with quaint cafes and themed restaurants. The whole vibe of the place was pleasant. Surprises await you at every turn. So fortunate that my hotel - Makers Hotel was just opposite so i could visit it easily both in the day and night., March 2019

Do not missed this place if you come to Insadong as you will find tons of pretty decorated cafes, 90's arcade room, place to rent Hanbok (Korean traditional dress), and many more. Another place to visit Hanok Village if you have no time to go to BukchonFun Fact : The Ikseon Hanok Village itself is older than Bukchon!Have to do : Take as many as pictures you can. Feel the tradition vibe!", October 2018
28,5.0,One of our favourite parts of Seoul,"We stayed near Ikseon-dong and visited a number of times, it was one of our favourite parts of Seoul.

29,4.0,Small hanok alley in the middle of Seoul,"It's a small alleys that filled with hanok houses. It's lovely & cozy to walk around from the late morning.

30,3.0,Fun. It's odd with modern business.,"This is a Hanok(Korean traditional house) neighborhood with many old-styled houses.But, I am disappointed to see many trendy shops and restaurants here.It's absurd to see gift shops or foreign restaurants in Hanok alleys. They are good to visit, though.Some houses may be old. And most seems quite new.", September 2018
31,5.0,Love It,"Along those fees narrowed streets you ll find some good restaurant , cafes and really good near shops and bakeryIt s like a small , funny , colorful villageSo pleasant so beautifulGreat Atmosphere I recommend", May 2018
32,3.0,Gentrified Area,This area has seen a major renewal in the last few years and has become gentrified.  It’s a good place to see the older section of Seoul with many shops and restaurants throughout.  Walk through it and enjoy - locals no longer live here and it is more crowded than I was told that it would be.  Imagine narrow alleys with shops., May 2018
