17,5.0,very small park huge on history,This park is very small but has Huge Korean history.  This is where their independence was announced in 1919.  There are several large sculptured plaques on the wall that surrounds the park inside.  They are all about the war with the Japanese.  It shows the beginning and the end.

19,4.0,Quiet Park with Importance,"I took a walk through this park because we had visited the Prison in the morning and learned how pivotal this park was in Korea's drive for independence. When you enter the park you are able to view a map to orient yourself.  In reality you don't need it as the park is quiet and compact and filled with ordinary people relaxing under the trees.

There are few Statues and Monuments in the park including the famous “10 Storied Stone Pagoda” which was covered by a huge protective glass case.

29,2.0,Full of old men sitting around,Found it uncomfortable here - only place in Seoul I did.  Full of old men sitting around.  The statues and the pagoda were impressive but with hundreds of eyes on me I didn't stay long.  Then when I walked onto the side street a vagrant dropped his pants in front of me and pooed in the gutter - not nice overall...., September 2015

33,3.0,Small park with a nice pagoda,"There is nothing much in this park aside from the interesting Wongaksa Pagoda and Monument of Wongaksa stele.  As a temple hunter, I enjoyed it, but it doesn't have a lot to occupy you for a long time.  Worth seeing if you are visiting Insa-dong", March 2015

35,2.0,Very Small Park,, November 2014
36,3.0,Interesting place,"Chanced upon this place when I was in Insodong area. There's a really old pagoda in this park, and quite a number of stone murals depicting some wartime history, though I didn't notice any English explanation around. There's really nothing much in the park besides the two main things I mentioned earlier.", October 2014
37,3.0,Interesting History in a small park.,"We came across this park by accident and although there is not a lot to see, the Ten Storied Stone Pagoda of Wongaska Temple is quite amazing. This is actually the historic site where 33 representatives the march 1st Movement of 1919 recited the Korean Declaration of Independence from Japan. We were there at the time of the celebrations for Buddha's Birthday so there were hundred of lanterns around the trees - very colourful. The park is small, tranquil  and relaxing.", April 2014
38,4.0,Small but Historical.,Not a must-see but if you are in the area it is definitely worth a visit. This pagoda is one of the oldest in Korea and is very well preserved.

39,3.0,"Small, far less interesting than so many other places in Seoul",This small park amidst the modern buildings is nice but there are many more interesting ones in Seoul.

40,4.0,Nice park in the city,Tapgol Park is a nice enclosed park to rest & you can also see the Pagoda encased in a glass construction. There is a few places to sit & relax to escape the hustle & bustle of the city, September 2013
41,4.0,for some peace and quiet.,"While I was in Seoul, I didn't see a lot of old people. So I was surprised when I went to Tapgol Park.  A lot of elderly Koreans like to hangout here. However small it is, history actually happened here. This is a small park where you'll find the glass enclosed pagoda. It's also more relaxed and quiet here, a place to rest. It would be a shame to not drop by the park if you are already going to Insadong.", September 2012
42,4.0,Beauty in a strange place,, June 2013
43,2.0,Nothing worth seeing actually,Small park with an old tomb and a statue with lots of old men sitting around and also homeless ppl. I will not recommend to go there purposely to see this park., June 2013
44,5.0,"Fascinating, safe place","My first venture to the park was accidental, and magical.  I got off the subway and started walking.  Older men sat throughout the park playing a board game with black and white markers.  Restaurant owners had big flat pans of salted cabbage (for making KimChi) just sitting on the sidewalk, and jewelers were in shops all around doing traditional knotting.  I am 63, and several old men came up to me and asked, in English if I was American.  When I said yes they each then proceeded to thank me for the contribution the US made to help Koreans in the war.  Very touching.  I had a friend visit from the states, took her there, and she had the same experience.  I think Americans always have to remember they are in a foreign country, and to use common sense about walking alone at night.  This park, tho, is not to be missed.", February 2012

46,3.0,Small but nice,"A good place to rest a bit after walking around in the palaces or in Insadong. The park is quite small, but it protects a historical heritage. It's like a peace haven in the city.", August 2012
