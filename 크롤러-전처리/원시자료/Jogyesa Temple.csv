1,5.0,Worth a visit,"We were fortunate to be there when they had an annual ceremony, so we were able to see a small part of the services. Even though the temple is in the middle of the city, it was very peaceful. Everyone was very welcoming and it was free, in fact we got to drink tea and light", February 2020
2,5.0,Peaceful,This is such a beautiful piece of history located right in the middle of the city and yet it's still so peaceful there. Could be that each time I went it was raining but either way. I'd definitely go back if I ever get to Seoul again, September 2019

It is a working temple and people were worshipping there, so be sure to be respectful. It is lovely and has a nice plaza area. It is not very large. When I was there, they were starting to put up hundreds of colored lanterns in preparation for Buddha's birthday. Free to look at and easy to get to. Don't miss it!", March 2019
5,5.0,Great place to visit,"If you visit all of the palaces and want another added treat -- go to this temple.  They have guided tours ($1 USD), which are in Japanese, Korean or English.", December 2019
6,4.0,Chrysanthemum Festival ,"I was here in November when they were holding their Chrysanthemum Festival. The place was absolutely covered in flowers of all colours, it was beautiful! The main hall made for a nice contrast to the relative hustle and bustle of the temple grounds. There was a group of ladies making chrysanthemum shaped cake things that were filled with sweet bean paste...delicious. It's close to Anguk station but I walked here after visiting Changdeoksugung.I really enjoyed my visit and will definitely pop by when I'm next in Seoul.", November 2019
7,3.0,Another temple,Hidden in the city you need to look for it...even a local restaurant at 200m from the place did not know where this temple was...or maybe our foreign accent did not help..., December 2019
8,4.0,Gardens are AMAZING,We never entered the temple - were drawn in by the amazing garden displays.  We stumbled across this while looking for something else :-)   A pleasant surprise, October 2019
9,4.0,Beautiful and authentic,"If it is an active and continually used Buddhist temple, I would say it's authentic.  To that end, photography is not allowed inside but outside the building and the grounds are gorgeous.  Animal shaped shrubs and flowering plants along well groomed paths invite visitors into a peaceful environment within the confines of a bustling downtown.  Take special note of the swastika at the top of one of the temples.  Obviously, it has a different meaning than what we are used to.  Still, it invokes in me a strange feeling to see that symbol so prominently displayed.  30 minutes is enough.  And as there is no admission fee, it is one of the few places left that tourists can go visit for free.  4 stars.", November 2019
10,5.0,Jogyesa Temple - A treat for the eyes,Jogyesa Temple is an oasis against the chaos of Seoul's bustling streets.Near Insadong this temple is the center of Korean Buddhism.

We were picked up from our hotel in a medium sized shuttle bus and taken to this temple, to meet the rest of the group (then went to other locations in a big bus).  The tour guide gave some explanations of this temple and gave us 20 minutes to look around, take pics.Part of the temple was roped off.  We saw a lot of people inside, and also many people kneeling outside in a roped off area, praying and paying tribute.  There are three golden color buddha statues inside.  It is a relatively small temple/site, therefore an easy place to meet.", September 2019
14,5.0,"Quiet in a busy city, beautiful.","I visited Jogyesa Temple on a Sunday afternoon. The temple is small. It is on a corner of center of busy city. However, once inside the temple it became quiet and tempo became slow. It was time that mum bloomed. The flowers and plants were fully and creatively integrated into many many objects in the temple - trees, statues, characters and bonsai's. The main build is quiet and peaceful. You can enter it after taking off shoes. This is a temple that is unique. I recommend visiting it if you have time.", October 2019
15,5.0,Chrysanthemums,This large and important temple holding three golden buddhas is located in central Seoul so it is easy to get to. Although it is surrounded by high rise office buildings it still manages to retain a sense of calmness.When we were there in late October we were lucky to find that the Chrysanthemum Festival was in progress and the whole of the area outside the temple was occupied by statues and sculpures made out of thousands of the flower in a myriad of colours. It really was spectacular and a photographers dream. If you can I'd suggest you time your own visit to co-ordinate with it., October 2019

20,4.0,Nice Temple in Heart of Seoul,"This is a working temple. Locals use it for daily prayers and the interior to the main building is reserved for worshipers. However, it is open to see inside and take pictures. Interesting architecture and murals on the outside of the buildings are beautiful. Worth a visit.", September 2019
21,4.0,"Pretty, and different","This complex is structured quite differently from others that I'd been to - the grounds feel very open and rather haphazardly laid out. It's right in the middle of block after block of office buildings; you might think you were looking in the wrong location as you're headed towards it. The main temple building is definitely worth a visit - that's where you'll really get a sense of the vastness and serenity you might normally associate with the more traditional temples.As temples go, I think it's worth a visit because it's so different, but not necessarily a must-see if you're crunched for time.", October 2019
22,5.0,Visit during chrysanthemum festival,Temple is absolutely beautiful. We visited during the chrysanthemum festival so it was full of flowers. We were made to feel very welcome. Definitely worth visiting in the evening to see temple lit up., October 2019

This is an active temple as well, so it amazing to participate in or just watch a service.", September 2019
30,5.0,Birthday trip,Jogyesa Temple was one of our first stops on the first full day tour in Seoul. The lotus garden/the pagoda tree and baby Budda were the highlights for me. Our guide Kasey was very accommodating/ and patient while each member of my family made their private wishes while rubbing the famous Pagoda tree n taking pics. It was surprising to find this temple so close to the big city not to mention to lotus garden. This temple was the precursor to  our other temple visits. Because of the size and time of day we only need 30 minutes to tour and hear the history of this temple. Definitely put it on your list if you are in the area., September 2019
31,5.0,Stunning temple - the highlight of our trip ,The temple was absolutely stunning. We visited it during the afternoon and then again in the evening to see the lights lit up. It took our breath away and the photos really can’t do it justice!, August 2019
32,5.0,Large Buddhist Temple,Jogye-sa is a very important buddist temple in Korea. It is the largest buddhist temple in Seoul. A very active temple there was a ceremony taking place when we visited and the ritualistic chanting was very atmospheric. Classic Korean architecture combined with Buddhist detail., July 2019

I discovered this place on my second night and will come back each evening now to enjoy its splendour.Quite, quite magnificent  5 stars doesn't seem enough to give.", July 2019
43,3.0,"Beautiful, but confusing without a guide","We visited on a Monday, when the museum is closed. The temple is worth seeing, and it's in central Seoul near the main palace and the US Embassy. But without a guide, it was hard to understand what was what between the different buildings. It was hard to find a pamphlet in English (though there is a pavilion we eventually found that had a little brochure in English).  Beautiful temple, but it was not the highlight of our visit because we didn't learn as much as other places we went.", July 2019
44,4.0,beautiful temple,"Easy to find and get to. The temple was beautiful, some smaller temples were under construction though.

45,5.0,Very UNIQUE Temple!,"I haven't seen a temple quite like this one before. The multi-colored lanterns strung up in the skyline are mesmerizing. You'll find yourself staring up there, unable to stop yourself. The temples are beautifully painted and decorated. A must-see in the Insadong area. However, be respectful. We went on a Sunday morning and it was filled with local worshipers. Please treat their beliefs and ceremonies with respect and do not try to pose in front of their statues as they're trying to pray (which we saw on more than one occasion in our brief time there) Also, refrain from entering the main temple as a ceremony is going on. It's allowed, but how would you feel if someone entered your church in the middle of worship, loudly, and began taking pictures everywhere?", May 2019

I don't think I'd go out of my way to visit, but then I have seen a lot of temples in Asia in the past. I suggest leaving your shoes at the door and going inside to experience the tranquility and ambience. For Buddhists this would be a must-visit. The three Buddhas are quite stunning. No photography inside is allowed.", May 2019
56,4.0,Colorful,"There were numerous lanterns handing with papers from them. It is a small temple grounds but still has much to offer. They still had prayer areas, theater, shop, cafeteria, and a few other things. Like many other reviewers, I have been to larger temples but do not compare temples due to size. The colors on the temple make it more than worth the trip. Despite its size, it is one of the most important temples in Korea for Buddhism.", May 2019
57,5.0,Serene and beautiful...see my note on how to enjoy Seoul. ,"Fortunately we were here early May when they celebrated the Buddha’s birthday. Lighted lanterns strung all over the street and at the temple. Three Buddha’s each having a different function. There is no organized tour as far as I could tell. The first ever post office in Korea is also located on the same grounds. Tip:  If you want to really get a lot out of touring South Korea hire a private tour guide from VIP Travel (Susan). We had the concierge from the hotel organize or for us. Car and guide 500k Won plus fees. We really developed an understanding for their culture this way and saw a lot with the car whisking us around town. No more than 6 hours is my suggestion. She also took us to a local place for lunch. Again, a cultural experience.", May 2019
58,5.0,Spiritually important,It was worthwhile visiting to see this important temple and our visit was enhanced by the various displays of lanterns and offerings for Buddha’s birthday. But it was more moving still to see the many faithful showing personal devotion in their prayers, May 2019

60,5.0,Go here around Buddha's birthday!,"It's a pretty small temple, not much to explore, but it's so worth the visit. Inside the main temple building you can see 3 big golden statues of Buddha (pay attention on where you should take off your shoes). Yet, it's most worth visit on around the end of April, during May, and beginning of June (around the date of Buddha's birthday), since they decorated the whole temple with the most festive looking lanterns! Guaranteed to take the most mesmerizing pictures!", April 2019

There is a lack of peace and quiet to appreciate this place", March 2019
69,5.0,Calm and Beautiful,"Jogyesa is a beautiful temple with impressive Buddha statues. The decorations in the temple are intricate and the courtyard is beautifully lighted up.

But, if you go, please be mindful that people are actively praying all around you, not just inside/in-front-of the main temple.  It is a colorful and joyful place.  At first, some of the figures in the garden made me feel like a child.  I expected to run into Hello Kitty or somewhere.  I didn't read up in advance about it so I missed appreciating in the moment what it all meant.  Regardless, it is interesting both from a cultural standpoint for a non-believer visitor, and though from another faith, I certainly appreciated that this place is very special to many.

It's a fully functioning temple with a great history, with a number of differnt components to explore.

We enjoyed it so much that we went two times during our trip. The first time we arrived at an hour which was filled with people in the terrace, on their knees, praying, hearing the monk speak over the microphone.

160,2.0,Only for a quick stop,"Not particularly a Buddhist myself, I would not recommend any tourists going out of their way if only to visit this temple. As it isn't particularly unique compared to temples in China (and this one is quite small), you should only pass through this temple if you're coming through from Anguk station, through Insadong, the temple then perhaps making your way to Geonggbukgong temple.As it is a temple, you will need to be a bit more respectful. Eg: going into the main temple with 3 gold Buddha's, you will need to take off your shoes and maintain peace and quiet. I would not recommend taking photos here due to the nature of this place. Outside, where there is a pavilion/tower, if there is a Buddhist conducting prayer, they may be chanting whilst circling round the pagoda. It may be a good idea to ensure you're not in their way. Despite all that, if you're interested in writing out your prayer/wishes, visit the tourist information office near the gates where you may take one of the wishes card to write your wishes on. Right next to the gate, you will be able to hang your wish card and also take a postcard back home as souvenir.All in all, a quick visit that may not take you more than 30 minutes if you can navigate your way.

And compared to many Zen temples in Japan (Kyoto in particular) it did not seem to have a relaxing feel about it. It's very easy to access, so if you're in the area then maybe it's worth a visit, but I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to visit.", January 2018

169,5.0,Serenity in the Heart of Seoul,"Jogyesa Temple is one of the most important Buddhist temples in Korea and a symbol of Korean Buddhism. It is located in the heart of the city near Insadong. Since 1936, it has been the head temple of the first district of the Jogye Order of Korea Buddhism.The temple was first established in 1395, at the start of the Joseon Dynasty. The modern temple was established in 1910 and was originally located at a different location. At this time, the temple was known as Gakhwangsa.In 1937, it was moved to its current location where it was reconstructed. Construction was completed on October 25, 1938.At this time, the temple was known as Taegosa. This was during the Japanese occupation of Korea (1910-1945). The name stayed the same until 1954.After liberation, in 1954, the Buddhist Purification Movement was established. The goal of the movement was to eliminate any residual Japanese influence from their occupation. That same year, the temple was renamed to Jogyesa. This was a way for Korea to move on and forget the past horrors of the Japanese occupation.In late 1998, Jogyesa was occupied by monks taking part in a protest and power struggle between the Jogye Order organization. After 40 days, riot police were called in to expel the protesters. The story made international headlines.Today, Daeungjeon (Main Dharma Hall) is the largest temple building in the city of Seoul and on its own is a spectacular and colorful sight for any visitor.Visitors here will be surprised to find a beautiful setting and sense of calmness in the middle of the hectic and crowded city. The grounds are a great escape from the big city for both locals and tourists. Some of the nature that is not to be missed include a rare 500 year old Baeksong lacebark pine tree and a 450 year old Chinese scholar tree.Jogyesa Temple may not be the most beautiful or grand grounds in Korea, but its strength lies in its convenient location makes it one the most visited and popular temples in central Seoul.", March 2017

I'll never forget this experience.  I've seen many Buddhist temples in different countries, but this one so resonated with me.  Such spirit it has.  Visit the gift shop too for some wonderful items.

181,5.0,Nice temple visit with lunch and tea ceremony with a monk,"Visited the temples during a chrysanthemum festival, so the grounds were beautifully decorated with colorful flowers. The grounds were a nice oasis in the middle of the city, but was not exactly peaceful due to the crowds. Our group scheduled time to speak with a monk for a tea ceremony and a short lesson on mediation which was nice. We also ate lunch across the street, served buffet style, which was the best vegetarian meal I have ever had. The meal was a diverse combination of flavors and used ingredients like black sesame pastes that I have never tasted in vegetarian meals. I was overall very impressed with the whole visit and would recommend it to anyone visiting Seoul.", October 2017
182,5.0,Oasis in the city,This is a beautiful working and living temple complex very close to Insadong and absolutely a must-visit for anyone interested in Buddism. Not recommended for those expecting a themepark experience. This is a place for respectful quiet and somewhere to appreciate the still deeply held philosophical beliefs of many Koreans., October 2017
183,5.0,Beautiful Small Temple in the middle of concrete jungle,"I went in October where the entrance to the temple were filled with flowers.  Flowers every where.  I walked in smiling and left smiling.  It's small compare to other temples.  If you are expecting a huge temple in a crowded city, you are mistaken and go out the city where there are plenty large temples.  If you are in Seoul for couple of days, visit this.  Stop comparing to other temples.   It's small b/c its in a middle of tall building in a small crowded city.  But go and see this small beautiful place.", October 2017
184,5.0,Different from a normal Buddhist temple  ,"Small temple with a difference. Plenty of flowers and lanterns, still rather peaceful. Bought some black sticky rice with brown powdery covering from the Korean lady - like a sweet and very tasty.", October 2017
185,5.0,City respite,"If you get tired of the shopping at Insadong and palace sightseeing, this temple is a nice little respite to stop and have a rest. Spacious peaceful yard which we were welcome to sit in, perhaps you will be lucky to chance upon the prayers and chants. You can take photographs of the building and garden landscape but no photographs of the inside. One nice Korean lady invited us to go into the temple where the prayers are happening in what I assume to be the main hall so it must be okay to go in and sit respectfully, but best to double check if you really want to go in.", October 2017
186,5.0,"Important temple, not just a calm in the busy streets","This is the central temple of the Jogye sect of Buddhism, the most important sect of the tradition in Korea. The tradition dates back over 1000 years, and connected with prominent places like Haeinsa Temple in the southern part of Korea. Jogyesa is relatively new, but has become important for Buddhism in modern Korea. It has been the site of political protests, and important religious work. Its a small place, so for the tourist looking to take a few pictures, you'll be done soon, but read up a bit on it and you'll appreciate it more, especially considering its central location.", November 2016
187,5.0,Free temple,"This is a very unusual temple. It's sandwiched in between a lot of modern building, that has clearly encroached on the temple ground. In October 2017, the grounds had wonderful flowers and floral displays, but I don't know if that's always there. The temple 'decor' is a bit childish, which in itself is quite unique. You can visit two temples inside, but you must remove your shoes and no inside photography is allowed.", October 2017

193,5.0,A great find in the middle of Seoul,"It was surprising to find such a temple in the middle of Seoul, it was set back from the road and not so easy to see at first, but well worth the effort. The temple was very busy at the weekend with worshippers, with only a few of us tourists! The place comprised of the temple itself plus what seemed to be a separate building for study on the ground floor (with the 2nd floor being inaccessible). Although not a lot to see, what is there is well worth the trip, and so convenient to reach. We visited the temple after visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace (within walking distance of this).", September 2017

196,5.0,Don't miss this!,I think this was the best part of my Seoul trip. I had the luck of visiting this temple after sunset and everything was beautifully lit and the area breathed serenity.

The red and green theme decoration on the wooden structure is beautiful. The lovely lotus pots in front are so nice and aromatic. I highly recommend this temple in Seoul., August 2017
200,5.0,A spiritual and moving experience,"Not only did I feel privileged to have been able to see this magnificent temple, I was also able to be inside and participate in a ceremony. I felt in awe of the warmth people offered us to be with them and to join them in prayer. We were offered cushions by many who welcomed us inside. This exquisite site should be in everyone's list of things to do in Seoul. We happened to be there for the celebration of Buddah's birthday and we're invited to join a large group of volunteers, all Korean locals, to design the paper lanterns to be used in the celebrations the following day. My friend and I were really moved by this amazing experience. So beautiful!", April 2017

202,2.0,Quite small and a bit boring,"I love visiting temples, and I took a trip to Japan earlier in the year visiting a lot of temples and shrines and fell in love with them - I was disappointed with the size of this temple and it is situated in not the nicest area. I would suggest visiting Gyeongbokgung palace and missing this out if you're rushed for time.", August 2017
203,5.0,Hidden Gem,"This temple hidden in the city is a little tough to find. Once we got there we were mesmerized by all of the beautiful colors of the lanterns that create a canopy over the grounds. The Buddhas themselves are beautiful.

206,4.0,Hidden Temple worth the find,I set out to find this temple while walking in Seoul. It is somewhat hidden and out of the way. It is not particularly large as compared to many temples in Thailand. I arrived during a prayer service which was very well attended. There is less economic activity on the grounds of the temple than what you would find in Thailand also. It is interesting and worth the walk but don't expect it to be the same as some other countries., August 2017

You can enter the temple but remember to remove your shoes and respect the other people who are there to pray. It appears that it is better to wear socks so you aren't walking barefoot in the temple. Usually, there are Buddhists outside the temple as well (as least in warm weather). You should not take pictures inside the temple. There is are a restaurant and a number of Buddhist supply stores that are very interesting to experience.

The main temple is beautiful, and was in full business when I was there, chanting and all.There's a nice entry gate from the main road, and a few shops catering to appropriately Buddhist stuff along there as well.This is a bit different from my experience with temples and shrines in Japan, with the Chinese influence much more pronounced.Worth a visit.", June 2017
221,5.0,The Most Amazing Temple on the Korean Peninsula: 조계사 ^_^,"My girlfriend and I went to Jogyesa and wanted to try the temple stay at the best temple in Korea, but then decided not to due to time constraint, because we also went to Nami Island and other fun places in Taehan Minguk.Established back in 1395 during the Joseon dynasty, it changed its name back to Jogyesa Temple after the Japanese were defeated in World War II.Inside the main building, there are three Golden Buddhas, I assume made of pure gold because they are very shiny, and people were either prostrating, reading sutras, or just meditating on their mats.Surrounding the three Golden Buddhas, is the most famous Buddhist Sutra, originally in Chinese Characters, but now also available in Korean language: The Great Diamond Sutra, translated by Kumarajiva, an Indian who also know the Chinese language better than most Chinese Monks.We spent around 2 hours, and recited the Diamond Sutra in Chinese, including the ending Mantra, which is not commonly seen in the Mandarin version.Overall, the temple is amazing, and Buddhist Monks ring the bell and chant sutras that calm the mind every hour, and there is a nice store that sells many books and Buddhist itineraries, and I happily bought a copy of the Prajnaparamita Heart Sutra in Korean.Aje Aje Para Aje Para Sam Aje Boddhi Satvaha ^_^", May 2017

But being said that, to see here are three nice-sized golden Buddhas inside the temple building (actually ""fairly big"" statues for a temple building of that size), some ""artistic"" flowers & human figures & such carved on windows and in like square frames on upper parts of the building's exterior with also some paintings (that you don't need to look up) and a miniature multi-level pagoda (the ""miniature"" is about 25 or 30 feet tall though) on the temple grounds in front of the temple building; and in like a two-storied tower just to the left of the entrance is a big drum although it's somewhat ""hidden"".Also worth mentioning is that the temple is either in or just a few minutes' walk away from the well-known Insa-dong area with antique shops & such; I walked for about 15 minutes in that area after coming out of the temple (turning right then a left a little later) and passed by many shops but didn't actually go into any of them. Coming by subway, the nearest station just about a 5-minute walk away is Anguk (on Line 3) which is also the station you would take to go to places like Bukchon Hanok Village and Changdeokgung Palace; but what's convenient is to come here after Gyeongbokgung Palace from which it's only like a 10-minute walk to get here (a left turn after coming out of Gwanghwamun Gate followed by a little over a 5-minute walk, then a right turn followed by a few minutes' walk and you'll see the temple on your right).  As for Gyeongbokgung Palace (the biggest of Seoul's five palaces), you can either take Line 3 to Gyeongbokgung Station right beside the Palace or take Line 5 to Gwanghwamun Station just a 5-minute-or-so walk south of the Palace (I recommend Gwanghwamun Station where you'll see coming out of the station the big statues of Admiral Yi Sun Shin & king Sejong the Great and you'll get to go through the great Gwanghwamun Gate to enter the Palace which won't be the case if you come out of Gyeongbokgung Station right beside the Palace).", June 2016

277,4.0,"Koreas’s most famous Buddhist Temple, 조계사","1 of the few established Temple in Seoul it is easily accessible via Anguk station. Jogyesa Temple is the center of Zen Buddhism in Korea and the main temple of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism. The temple is at its present site since 1937.As we walked along the street around Jogyesa Temple we noticed the many Buddhist specialty shops selling related items like the prayer beads, Buddhist writings, calendars, incense, as well as souvenirs such as dolls and key chains.  We din buy any but find it so interesting…The first things you will notice at the temple are the lovely trees and the ‘explosion’ of the garden brilliant colours!. These baeksong trees in front of the Daeungjeon, the main temple building, are about 500 years old. One of them claimed to be above 20-meter high. The temple area has several buildings. The entrance has large pots with planted lotuses. The area is festooned/hung with lanterns which made for a wonderful sight too.The temple is spacious and crowded with worshippers.. There are three large, golden Buddha images inside the temple. A real good place for taking photos and just walk around. Appreciate the wonderful sight and sense of calmness (mind), where the bustling streets is just outside.

The properly around the temple was decorated with thousands of mums in many different types of arrangements including tunnels, trees, and altar shapes. The central temple (we did not go in as a service was in progress) was enormous and beautiful from the outside. Through the windows we could see the worshipers and the enormous Buddha statues inside. A beautiful lantern illuminated tree was also on the property. I assume some of the decorations were seasonal but some of them are permanent.

The grounds surrounding it are beautiful, offering water scenes, plants, trees (one of them is 500 years old,) canopies of lanterns, and beautiful architecture. While not a quiet attraction necessarily, it was very peaceful and tranquil. The temple is a great spot in the city to take a break from the cars and mass transit, and gather your thoughts. I would recommend this to anybody seeking to learn more about Buddhism, or somebody who just appreciates beauty in nature and architecture.The help desk was staffed by kind, knowledgeable people. They were quick to answer my questions, and were very happy that we signed a guest book.One thing to note, I added this temple to my Google maps, and ended up at a post office museum instead. Not a problem, the temple is just a block or so farther down the road.
