3,5.0,Spent 3 hours here!,"I decided to visit the museum at the last minute and it ended up being the highlight of my visit to Seoul.One floor was about Korean military history up to the Korean War and another floor was focussed on the Korean War. The displays and commentary were perfect - they gave enough detail without overloading you with information. It was very, very well done.Inside and outside of the museum there were displays of military equipment from both sides of the conflict.", February 2020
4,5.0,Very Proud to be Canadian,The whole museum is beautiful as it goes back to ancient times. What really got us feeling proud was the list of Canadian soldiers who died in defending Korea and it opened our eyes as to how that war got started in the first place. This was part of the one day DMZ trip., January 2020
