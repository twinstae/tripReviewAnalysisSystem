0,5.0,Peaceful and Insightful in the Middle of A Metropol.,Really this is one of the few places I enjoyed in Seoul. Seoul is by far one of the cities that I don't like and it is greatly because of the coldness and lack of warmth of its people. but still we like to travel to understand the past of every culture and the origins of their, January 2020

2,4.0,Informative tour,"Jongmyo shrine is a fascinating visit for anyone interested in Seoul’s history. You can only visit the shrine with a guided tour (except on Saturdays apparently) but the tour is included in the ticket price. The guide was passionate & informative & ensures to sensitive tourists to the meaning & customs of the shrine. The tour takes about 1 hour.  Definitely worth doing, especially if you don’t know a lot about Joseon customs & traditions.", November 2019
3,3.0,Good for a relaxing walk in the park and some Korean history,Entry to the Jongmyo Shrine is included in the Royal Palace pass but you can only enter with a tour - English tours are at 2pm and 4pm. A pleasant walk in a shady park on a hot day and interesting to find out about how the ancient kings were honoured but not as picturesque as the palaces in terms of architecture and decoration., September 2019
4,4.0,Shrine for the spirits of kings,, October 2019
5,4.0,Fascinating view of how the spirits of the Kings are honored.,, September 2019
6,4.0,Because it is a UNESCO Heritage site?,Decided to visit the attraction because it was listed as a UNESCO Heritage site and entry was free because of the Chuseok holidays. Was nice to walk through a place of history and I liked the vast open space of the Jeongjeon area., September 2019
7,5.0,History on display,, August 2019
8,5.0,A UNESCO Heritage site in the heart of Seoul,"A must visit site that can be visited ONLY with free guided tours provided on-site. English speaking tours are at 10am, 12pm, 2pm and 4pm. You are not allowed to join other language tours. On saturdays, you can enter the shrine on your own without a tour guide. Entrance fee is 1000 won incl tour guide", June 2019
9,4.0,Royal Shrines,"These Royal shrines are UNESCO World Heritage listed. The shrines are set in a parkland landscape. I strongly advise visiting on Saturday as this is the ONLY day self guided tours are allowed. All other days a guided tour is compulsory. The two main shrine buildings are impressive for their size. Entrance is 1000KW, the Royal Palace Pass works here. Watch out for the spirit way and don't walk across it!!", July 2019
10,4.0,Guided tours only,The only way to enter the shrine is through the guided tour offered by the staff. It is very organised and detailed. This is an interesting tour about ancestral worship for the past kings and queens. The shrine is included in the Royal Palace Pass along with the other palaces. A good deal if you have enough time to go for all., July 2019
11,3.0,"Not much to it, don't go expecting much.","Don't visit expecting to be blown away or see a something really mind blowing. The shrine was free for myself and my mother as we were on a tour, but normally it's like 1200 won I believe. There's some neat gardens and the tombs of the 19 main Joseon emperors. That's about it. Some decent photos, but nothing crazy. Once you start the walk you have to finish it, so if you're not sure about your legs, save your time. There are also lots of racoons walking around, but they don't bother people.", July 2019
12,3.0,Jongmyo Shrine,"The surroundings were beautiful, as you can see from the photos. I wasn’t overly excited by the shrine itself. Nonetheless, it was interesting to learn about the king, prince and spirits and the pathways designated to them through the shrine.", August 2019
13,4.0,Easy and Affordable Family Tour,"My family and I visited this shrine and were impressed with the beauty and history of the site that was easily accessible using public transportation and the price was affordable.  It can get hot, especially since the shrines are in wide-open spaces paved with stone, but the paths leading to the shrines are in the shade.", June 2019

15,5.0,Interesting and peaceful ,, July 2019
16,5.0,Peaceful & Educational,"Visited this UNESCO site during my trip to Seoul and was very glad I did.  The whole experience was fantastic and well organized.  This is the only site that requires guided tour to enter thus the crowd flow was manageable allowing visitors to take their time, photos and walk through the vast site to fully appreciate this piece of jewel of the past. Visitors must take note of the guided tour times and show up in time to join them. I didn't buy tickets ahead of time, just showed up at the ticket counter 1 hour before the tour, buy ticket and wait.  It was a worthwhile wait.  Highly recommended,", June 2019
17,3.0,PEACEFUL SETTING,Jongmyo Shrine is worth a visit if you are in the general area.. We were not able to enter the shrine.  For some this may involve more walking and steps than its worth.  It helps to have a guide--otherwise it is just a restful stroll.., June 2019
18,4.0,Lovely parklike setting . . .,"Not one of the ""must see"" places of Seoul, but if one is in the area it is interesting to visit the site where the ""spirit tables"" of the royalty and priviledged servants of the Joseon Dynasty reside. No, this is not a cemetary which is the final resting place for the body -- but rather the final resting place for their spirits.", June 2019
19,1.0,Get there on time,"Aparently you have to join a guided tour (except Saturdays and the last Wednesday of every month) which isn't mentioned clearly in official Seoul tourist guide. So when I arrived, the English tour already started and they refused to sell me a ticket for a Korean or Japanese tour. They only wanted to sell me a ticket for an English tour, which  I would have to wait hours for. The pictures look great, though.", May 2019
20,5.0,You may find this more beautiful than the palaces!,"After visiting all the palaces and temples in Seoul, I happened across the Jongmyo Shrine, where the spirit tablets of deceased kings and queens are enshrined. Most days you need to go on a guided tour (cost in May 2019 - just 1000 won!), offered in a number of languages. Because I arrived in time for the last tour of the day, it was in Korean. I was fortunate to have a bilingual family on the tour, who interpreted the main points for me. This has been one of the most serene and beautiful experiences of historic sites in Korea. The whole place exudes tranquility. I was fortunate to visit on a glorious afternoon, when the shafts of sunlight shone through the majestic trees in the complex. As our group of about 20 were the only people there, we were able to get a better sense of the history.", May 2019
21,3.0,Maybe on another day?,"If this was all there was in the area then it would be great, but there are some very impressive “competitors” nearby. On a Saturday, the main halls were closed, leaving you with some nice greenery and walk. But after your first 5 shrines, you start to get quite discerning", May 2019
22,5.0,Beautiful UNESCO Heritage Site,"The royal memorial site was filled with history and gorgeous outdoor scenery while still being centrally located within Seoul. Although we had to visit with a tour guide, I really enjoyed having someone so knowledgeable lead us around, teaching us about the historical significance of this special place. My son enjoyed being outdoors and made a game of avoiding stepping on the spirits’ pathway that runs through the property.", March 2019
23,5.0,A Beautifully Informative Spiritual Tour,, March 2019
24,5.0,Peaceful and spiritual,"You can only enter the shrine as part of a tour. Even though we arrived 5 minutes after the English tour had started, they hurried us in so that we could catch up with the group. The place was beautiful and so peaceful. Our wonderful tour guide gave us a thorough history of the shrine and explained all the concepts simply. The shrine wasn’t too busy therefore we were able to enjoy the area as a small group and take many photos that were not filled with people! We would definitely recommend for an admission fee of 1000won (67p)!", April 2019
25,5.0,Spiritual and peaceful ,Great Confucian shrine of the entire Joseon Dynasty. The guided tour was well organised and informative. As a UNESCO World Heritage site shouldn’t be missed during the visit in Seoul., March 2019

30,4.0,"Very nice palace and gardens, the guided-tours only policy makes it less crowded than other similar historical sites","This is a very nice palace and gardens, and the guided-tours only policy makes it less crowded than other similar historical sites. It can only be seen from the outside, as the main buildings is a mausoleum, but inexpensive and definitely worth a visit.", December 2018
31,4.0,Interesting history,, October 2018
32,4.0,Interesting place but I wish there was more to see,, October 2018
33,5.0,Informative guided tour,Recommend to join the guided tour where alot of history and cultural perspective will be shared along the tour journey. It's simply amazing when you imagine what's happened here in the past few hundred years of time. Definitely worth any penny where the tix price is only cost 1000krw., November 2018

36,5.0,Serene and peaceful place ,"Definitely worth the 1000 krw admission tickets. However your will need to join the tour to get in, except on Saturdays. Do take note of the tour language listed on the website, different tours at different timings. The walking tour is about 1 hour", November 2018
37,5.0,A tranquil shrine in central Seoul. Must join the tour.,, October 2018

39,4.0,Only tour allow except Saturday,Please check the time before go as only tour is allow. Anywhere it's a free tour. We are lucky as we know chinese and english cause the tour is 1 hours each switch between chinese and english.

40,3.0,Jongmyo,, October 2018
41,3.0,"Good to get tour, avail in several languages.","Did a guided tour in English which helped a lot. Very serene place to visit. This is a shrine and so has a more sombre feel and vibe to other sites. Very large area to walk. Took one hour to do tour, but glad to do it and get an insight into the history and background to the Shrine.", October 2018
42,5.0,Loved this place,It can be a bit tricky to find the entrance. If you are coming from the palaces you need to walk to the South gate of the park. Free entrance on the last Wednesday each month. Beautiful shrine and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A bit crowded like everywhere else., September 2018
43,4.0,Peaceful oasis in the centre of the city,"The well-shaded gardens provide a peaceful respite in the middle of bustling Seoul. If you don't arrive in time for one of the limited foreign language tours, your experience may be a bit limited though, as information signs are limited and the guidebook is not very informative. So check what time the tours are in your language before you go.", August 2018
44,1.0,Not worth visiting,"Visited the shrine on a rainy day in August 2018 and did not enjoy the English guided tour at all. First of all, the paths were quite muddy. Secondly, you cannot visit the shrine without being in a tour. Thirdly, most of the main buildings are closed and open only two times a year (sometime in May and November, I think). Fourthly, it is almost an impossible task to explain Confucianism in an hour guided tour and the guide said she wouldn’t even try to do so. This place is designated as a UNESCO site purely for historical reasons, nothing spectacular in here. Not very interesting unless you are into Korean imperial history. One positive thing I should comment on is the generosity of the Seoul heritage society. Admission was 1,000 KRW, but like Gyeongbokgung Palace, the fee would be waived for seniors (65 years or older) if you have a document (passport or driver’s) to prove your age - even for foreigners.", August 2018
45,4.0,Peaceful walk,"The buildings and scenery are very calming and serene. Walk through the park and imagine the spirits walking next to you. There's a short 13 min movie that plays on a loop in the park to educate you on the history. The cost for my wife, son and I was about $3 us. Sat and Mon you don't need a guide. All other days you do. Glad we did it.", August 2018
46,3.0,Visit ruined by poor English language guide,"Visited with a friend who booked us on an English guided tour. The shrine is a very important place as it houses the spirit tablets of deceased Kings and Queens and was one of the first structures built in the Joseon dynasty. Ceremonies are still held there and the interiors are open for viewing on 1 May every year if I remember correctly. The tour took us round the buildings which we can only see from the outside and we were told about the raised platforms/walkways - in palaces the highest is for the King but in shrines the most raised path in the middlle is for spirits. There are only limited times, I think Saturdays, where it's permitted to wander around the grounds without a guide. Unfortunately the guide we had was so poor she was incomprehensible most of the time so I would much have preferred to have been given the freedom to wander round on my own and read any information boards available. My Korean friend found the guide hard to understand to. A real shame.", July 2018
47,4.0,Kings and Queens Memorial Hall,"This huge area with many buildings for kings and queens memorial, since it's very big, you don't see much tourist, which is a big change from most attraction, more relax as you walk.", June 2018
48,4.0,Calming place,"It's not as impressive as the bigger palaces in regards to the buildings but this shrine is well worth a visit, especially on days when you can freely roam the site. It's in the heart of the city but once inside it feels as if you're in a different world, hundreds of years ago.", May 2018
49,5.0,Lovely shrine - a highlight,, April 2018
50,5.0,Land of the Morning Calm,"Although this was my fourth visit to Sth Korea, this was my first to Jongmyo Shrine and the first for my wife. What an amazing place of calm and serene step into nature and stunning architecture. This is a UNESCO World Heritage site and rightly so. Don't just walk through, take the time to sit and breathe in what the place has to offer but please respect to religious significance of the site and where they are sign that ask not to enter, please don't. The resting place of the spirit tablets of the kings, this place is deep and still the centre of Korea's most significant Jongmyo ceremonies. I am so glad we got the opportunity to visit.", May 2018

52,3.0,"Except Saturdays, only accessible on guided tours.","You can only get in to the Jongmyo Shrine Zone as part of a one hour guided tour.  1000krw.   (Except Saturdays.).   English tours were at 10, 12, 2 and 4.    If you need to kill some time,  the Gwangjang Market is only a couple blocks away.    The park setting is quiet, serene and somber.     If you’re interested in learning about Korean customs as they related to burials and mourning of dead kings and queens, this tour is for you.  If you’re looking for spectacular burial vaults and furnishings, look elsewhere.", May 2018
53,3.0,Nice but less exciting than other nearby historic sites,"A friend and I took an English language tour of the Jongmyo shrine over the winter. It was a lovely, serene place and the tour was interesting. We got some beautiful photos of the historic buildings in the stark winter setting. I'm glad we visited but I found some of the other nearby temples and palaces more exciting. Our guide told us that in November and May they have two fantastic large festivals on the grounds of the shrine. It would probably be more fun to go during one of those times!", March 2018
54,4.0,"Interesting historical site, worth a visit. It's affordable and fairly quick.","The shrine is located in downtown Seoul, near the East Gate. We started the morning off there with a quick metro ride from City Hall station... we saw the East Gate and the shrine in a couple of hours. The shrine is fairly big but quick to walk through. There is a walking path and recommended path as well as restrooms inside the walls of the shrine. There was some construction in the corner of the grounds at the time we visited but didn't seem to impact the experience much. Worth a visit if you have the time, it's one of the more affordable historical sites and one of the quicker ones to see along with the East Gate, just outside down the street.", April 2018
55,5.0,Took the Korean Language Tour,We missed the last English language tour. The last Korean language tour was an hour later so we just waited and joined that one. Visitors have to be part of a guided tour every day they are open except Saturday. If you just want to see the buildings and don't care about the information provided by the guide it's okay to go on one of the other tours. Staff made sure we knew it was not an English language tour and gave us a brochure in English. We were expected to stay with the tour which was fine with us. It lasted about 40 minutes., April 2018

58,5.0,As an archaeological site,It is a place where there is a magical place.There is a quiet corner. Can be taken as a souvenir in many angles. Feel like a time in the past. Keeps the mind calm. Spacious place.It is a historical site that gives tourists a sense of the vapor of the culture of this country in the past as well., May 2017
59,5.0,The necessary first stop before anything else in Seoul. ,"The tour is 1 usd or 1000 won, last one hour  and the necessary first stop in visiting Seoul. The guides were very informed, less crowded andgave historical and religious tidbits that you won’t get in the palaces or shrines. I enjoyed it more than visiting anything else during my time in Seoul.", March 2018

61,3.0,Check the Schedule for Different Language Tours,"KRW 1000 (US$1) admission.  Free tours in English most days of the week beginning at noon.

70,5.0,Subdued ornamentation for a reason,"This shrine is plain compared to the palaces you'll visit as part of your combination ticket, but that's because it's meant to be a place of reflection on the lives of the deceased rulers. Still lovely to see the difference as compared to the palaces.", December 2017
71,4.0,Guided Tour Shrine ,"It is definitely something neat and historical to see in Seoul, but the downside is that you have to take a guided tour of it. I would have preferred to walk through at my own pace and see it. The tour was a bit too long for my liking.", December 2017
72,5.0,Serene,Best to take a guided tour to totally understand what it meant for their ancestors.  Love it's serene surrounding and its purpose., November 2017
73,5.0,Very interesting but be wary of ticket restrictions,A highly interesting hour long guided tour around this wonderful heritage site. Thorougly recommended but make sure you check entry times and restrictions - for example tickets for guided tours in Korean are only allowed to be sold to Korean citizens even if you only want to view the buildings., October 2017
74,3.0,Not a great deal to see,"One of the six places to visit if you buy the Palace Pass for W10,0000, like the other five, this is a complete rebuild of what stood here centuries ago. It's all rather samey, with the same decor everywhere and none of the buildings are open to visit. You just wander the nice gardens and the courtyards. There is a small museum right of the entry gate which is well worth seeing, but you have to take your shoes off.", October 2017

77,4.0,Very interesting,This is a good place to learn about Korean culture.  You need to join a tour to see it (except on Saturday). Go to the website to check out times for your language. It costs 1000 krw including the tour. You will learn lots if you are new to Korean culture like I was., October 2017
78,4.0,Quite different compared to a temple tour,"Except for one day per week (Saturday I think) the tours are guided, around 4 per day in English. Worth the visit. Our guide was good, and explained plenty. This was very different to a temple tour. Unfortunately the 2 buildings containing the many VIPs' individual shrines are not open to the public! Good to hear the details of the place, and to see the buildings, but pity we couldn't see inside the main buildings.", September 2017

80,5.0,Beautiful serene place,This is a beautiful serene place in Seoul buried in history and home of lots of ancient traditions.

Not much to see, but the site itself and the shrines are full of history.  Tour took 70 mins, and it was a very touching, peaceful and thoughtful experience.  Highly recommended.", August 2017
84,5.0,UNESCO World Heritage,"Located at Jongno3(sam)-ga Station (Seoul Subway Line 1, 3, 5) and Exit 11. An interesting place to visit. Many locals gather there to play chess which could be an interesting sight to see. Free admission with guided tour at different timings. Good for a historic tour :)", April 2017
85,5.0,Historic Shrine - Fantastic Must Visit,You must take a tour to visit this place and their were only 2 english tours per day at the time we visited. Our guide spoke perfect english and was very informative about the resting place for the Emperors. The Gardens here were beautiful and not only were we told about the burial and mourning processes for the Koreans it also gave a very good insight in Confucianism. The guide was happy to answer any questions. The tour was a little fast (about 1 hour) and you did not have the opportunity to explore as you were kept together as a group however that was all part of being in a sacred place. This was by far one of the best attractions our family visited whilst in Seoul., July 2017
86,4.0,Interesting place.,We went here on a very hot an humid July day.  If you go here any other day than a Saturday you have to take a guided tour.  They run every 20 minutes but are in 4 different languages so if you timing is off you could wait and hour and 20 minutes for a tour in your language.  We were lucky and turned up just 3 minutes before the english language tour. Might have rated a lot lower if I had had to wait for an hour.  Anyway interesting tour takes about 50 minutes.  Learnt a lot about Korean history, July 2017
87,5.0,Travel with palace official guide!,"I love guide service, that shows Korean would reserve the historical place for new generations.

The buildings were largely devoid of objects and the experience was somewhat diminished by this.", April 2017
91,4.0,The spirit of royalty is unmistakable,"The shrine is a truly serene place, which helps explain why the curators only want visitors there on guided tours (which are exceedingly good value at KRW1,000 and available without booking ahead). Otherwise you'd have hundreds of people tearing around the place, shouting, trampling across sacred areas and taking selfies every five feet. It's an hour very well spent in a location that helps you build a better understanding of what Korean cultural heritage is about. To be recommended.", May 2017

110,4.0,Excellent Spot for Cultural Preservation Junkies,"Yes, it's quiet and yes, it's not a palace - but Jongmyo is still in use 1x a year (May) for a ceremony honoring the imperial Joseon ancestry which was designated by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. Really pretty stunning, even during the winter months. Would recommend visiting with a guided tour, but not necessary. If you go - don't want on the center path: it's reserved for the spirits (and the whole thing was built for them)!", November 2016
111,3.0,Not a palace,It you are time poor then skip this one. The buildings are impressive but miss the finer details of the palace's.  Much of the place is just painted red. Entrance is from the south of the park., January 2017
112,5.0,recommend to koreans as well as foreigners,Plan your visit! This place is only open at set times when the guide can take you around. You are not allowed to roam around by yourself as it is sacred. There are a few times in the day that the guide is given in english or another language. The information from the guides is really useful and we appreciated it as we went around seeing the shrine. A place I'd recommend to koreans as well as foreigners., November 2016
113,5.0,The must be religious place in Seoul,"The place can only be visited with guided tours during the week and I highly recommend the visit. I went there in the last English tour of the day (around 4PM) and was able to take some great shots during the beginning of the golden hour. The tour explains several details not only about the shrine itself but also from Korean history, I enjoyed a lot and can't recommend enough a visit here.", January 2017

Also talking about ancestors' royal families shrine still leaving behind now only be found in 3 countries in the world, Vietnam, China and S.Korea. Surprisingly that, the volume of visitors were low in particular for Chinese visitors. Looking at the frequency of foreign language narrative service, you will find Japanese speaking rank most, and English speaking second, while Chinese speaking sessions, might have 3 times a day only. Disappointing! Admission fee is less than 1 USD, believe it or not. You will be taken care of by a professional escort speaking the language you chose, either Japanese, English or  Chinese (putonghua), leading you from entrance to every track, building, temple, shrine and stories. Stunning perfect!

I think if you don't have someone to explain the history and significance of the shrine, you will really miss out. The price of admission is only 1000 won and the guide is free. So then you get all the interesting facts and have a better understanding of the buildings. The tour is only about an hour.", December 2016
119,3.0,Nothing much to see.,"This was another UNESCO World Heritage site which we were excited to see but it was a letdown.  These was just a compound with 3 major buildings, 2 of which were used to store the tablets of the kings, queens and other noblemen.  Since there was no tour on the day we visited, we really could not appreciate the shrine.  And the buildings were all close.  It would have been better if we could see a glimpse of a tablet or how it looks like, even just in an audio-visual presentation.", December 2016

127,3.0,Historical and quiet,"I found this place by accident as I was walking from Jongno 2-ga to Changdeokgung. On the map it showed a large garden in front of Changdeokgung so I walked near. In fact it is not part of Changdeokgung but is a most-respected shrine. The ticket office could not say much English except ""Conducted tour"". Anyway I bought a ticket for 1000 KRW and was fortunate that a tour just began. I followed the group (a class of young students) but could not understand what the Korean tour guide said. The place is historical and there are two main buildings. The architecture appears to be quite simple and straight-forward and is unlike that of Changdeokgung. Interesting place, as it is not commercialized like the other tourist hot-spots. Saw some small wild animals (squirrels, etc.) It is probably worth visiting if you have time after seeing the nearby palaces; just a 10-minute walk from Changdeokgung along a quiet lane.", October 2016

134,3.0,A quick visit.,"Having visited the palaces and had a lot of time to explore, we were hoping to take our time while visiting the shrine. Unfortunately access was only through a guided tour, though on our ticket it said there were no guided tours on Saturday. I don't know if this means that it is closed or you can go through the area on your own. The tour was about an hour long. The guide gave us some information but it seemed rather rushed and wasn't clear which is why we rated it a little lower than other attractions.", August 2016

Reading the sign, we realized that unless you visit on Saturday, entry is only allowed with a tour, and there are set tour times.
