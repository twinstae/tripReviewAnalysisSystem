If you are looking to buy tidbits, snacks, seaweed, etc. To bring home, the choices here are rather limited and do compare prices if you are buying a lot. We bought our items here but was disappointed to find prices for the same snack elsewhere in independent marts cheaper by 10,000 won and others by a few thousand won.

The supermarket takes up one side, then there are hundreds of small food stands selling every food item imaginable.  Bakeries, wine shops and food shops line the exterior of the room.  At the far end is a large food hall with many food counters where you order food and then take to tables.  The presentation of the food, the high quality and wide selection is unbelievable.  One bakery OPS has luscious pastries, as do most others.  Difficult to pick one over the other.  To reach Lotte, take the green line 2, and get off at Euljiro 1 stop or you can take the blue line 1, and get off at City Hall stop and just walk over.  Take a browsing of the basement food hall.

If you're looking for the department store setting, coming here is a must. It even connects to the subway system so you don't have to walk outside if you don't want to. The establishment also has their own aquarium and Lotte Mart (Walmart equivalent) and a larger basement food court. Quite an eye-opener.", April 2016
121,4.0,Love the Duty Free department ,"Always is a ""MUST"" for me visiting the Lotte Duty free products for foreigners while visiting Korea . Is easy to walk from Dongdaemun or Myeongdong . That's few floors for foreigners to shop for branded goods , foodies and skincare that we may pay but collect at airport  ,  we can enjoy buying as much and won't affected our baggage weight because goods will be collecting after check in baggage and security check . Some months may have super special deal for different credit cards holder. Nice.", December 2015
122,2.0,More expensive than lotte mart,Very crowded with tourist you can't even get basket to shop. It was luxurious compared to lotte mart and lotte outlet but the price were also more expensive that it was ridiculous. We went there to buy snack for gift and compared the price to lotte mart in seoul station. Our heart break each time we found how we lost so much money for the same brand of lotte snack, April 2016

126,4.0,Great food court,"This review is only about the food court level at Lotte Main.  It's an excellent place for eating and shopping for food items to take out, with the exception of wine and liquor (very limited selection, especially of liquor).  There are several casual restaurant style places where you can order mainly noodle/rice bowls and sit down at a table to eat.  And of course there are dozens of counters selling everything from sushi to pastries.  There's also a more traditional grocery store area with produce, meat/poultry/fish and other items.  If you go during the day it is quieter and easier to navigate, but one advantage of going within an hour or so of closing is that many of the more perishable items such as fresh-baked goods and prepared meal items with meat or fish are marked down for quick sale.  We were able to get dinner for two for about 10,000 won (less than $10) and a bag full of excellent pastries all marked down by 20%.  It's very crowded and bustling at that time but you can get some great bargains if you're willing to fight through the crowds.", March 2016

128,2.0,As crowded as night market ,"Yeah, this place is super super crowded, particular at the Duty Free shops at 9th and 10th floor. It feels like you are at a fish market or something, except that you are shopping for luxury brands and cosmetics. And don't be surprised, most people there are Chinese and even the staffs speak Chinese. They seem to have special promotion for foreigners from China.", February 2016

130,3.0,Congested stores and not great specials,"While the Lotte Department store is huge, it’s still just a mall with overpriced goods. If you like shopping with a tremendous crowd and pushy customers then be my guest and shop at Lotte Main Department store. There were some sale items but most stores appeared to have relatively few discounts and even the specials and promotions they had going on were worthless or useless. Try going to the outlets where there are still hordes of people but at least there are some pretty cool deals if you look hard enough or are a comparative shopper. Avoid this department store if possible.", February 2016

But it is too crowded and payment is separated at each store so it takes a lot of time in queue waiting to check out at each store.", October 2015
134,5.0,Shocked With The People Flow,"Despite being pre-warned by my friend to either go early or before closing time, I was totally shocked with the people flow in the duty free section of the department store located at 10-11 floor.  This is particularly true to the cosmetic and/or skin care section,  Here, they needed to register your passports or foreign ID for tax free price.  You can take the purchased items right away under Korean brands, otherwise, you need to pick up the goods at the airport for foreign brands.  This duty free section will be opened for business 1 hour earlier than regular business hour - there is a special entrance at the back (near car park) to go up.", December 2015

Not big enough for me, but maybe I am just used to the large malls we have in Manila. Was able to eat a salad at the food court. Supermarket was disappointing though. Not enough seaweed in my opinion.", October 2014
146,4.0,High end shopping,"We were a bit let down by shopping opportunities in Seoul, we thought it would be more like Tokyo and it isn't, so when we found Myengdong area and it's shopping opportunities we were happier :) Lotte department store was mostly out of our budget as it sells mainly higher end cosmetics and clothes, bags and other goods but if you are looking for higher end goods this is your place to go. The Shu Uemura section here is quite large as well and the staff was very helpful in getting us what we were looking for plus gave us a large pile of samples for free as well. Otherwise I'd suggest the neighbourhood around the department store- good quality, but cheaper cosmetic and clothing stores (even the western ones) and lots of cafes, restaurants and food stalls. The department store has a nice toilet though hahah :)", October 2014
147,2.0,Lotte Mall,We were disappointed with the selection of stores. We got the impression that Seoul would emphasise it's fashion outlets but there was little in the way of decent clothing.

There are multiple restaurant options on the higher floors. But we prefer the Premium foodcourt that is located in the basement, which is clean, brightly lit and has choices ranging from Japanese food to bulgogi etc.  There is also a well stocked supermarket, where the fruits especially are very fresh. You should also check out the small bakery near the foodcourt that sells very delicious fried mungbean fritters filled with red bean.", April 2014

It's amazing and a foodie dream", July 2013
175,5.0,"Yes, another food court review!  But what a food court!!!","I have noticed that the food court at Lotte department store in Myeongdong has had a few mentions here.  Well, you do have to experience it to know why.  Almost the entire basement of this high class department store has been dedicated to food.  There is a grocery section, stall after stall of kimchi sellers, a branch of Fauchon from Paris, and then there is the hot food section.  Heaven...!  For those of you, including, myself, who salivates over street food but can't quite work up the guts to indulge, the Lotte food court will satisfy your cravings.  Our favourite were the deep fried fish cake sausages (I am sure the Korean name for these are much more romantic...), with variations including a sesame leaf or seaweed wrap.  These were simply delicious.  Table real estate is scarce for the number of people wanting to eat, but we always ended up with a table, and we aren't very aggressive about this.  There are also non-street food options, such as sushi, fish, noodle, and rice bars.  You will eventually want to explore other food options, but if you are in the area this is a definite must see (and eat!!!).", June 2013

By the time I picked up the purchase at the airport, it was not the same exact purse the lady showed me. I remember details. The protective bag was missing and the purse didn't look as new as the one I was presented with at the store. So somewhere between the time I purchased the purse someone swapped out my purchase and taken out the simple protective bag?  I will never buy from them again as I do think trust them.
