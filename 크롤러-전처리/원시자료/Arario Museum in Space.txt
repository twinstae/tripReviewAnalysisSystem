0,5.0,Great modern art museum and building,Interesting modern art museum in an interesting building.  The installations make excellent use of the space - for example bathroom themes in old bathrooms- and fit well.  Watch your head - some of the ceilings are low.  Eat at the coffee shop next door and get a discount on, January 2020
1,5.0,Interesting Use of Space,, November 2019
2,5.0,Great Modern Art,Go and check it out. Great art in a unique setting. They made good use of the existing building and you get a good mix of modern art pieces. Can't understand the people not into modern art giving a bad rating. Don't go there if you don't like it in the first place. I don't like seafood. Just because I'm on vacation I don't visit a seafood place one recommends. Simple as that. Don't miss out on Fritz coffee next door., September 2019

5,5.0,Intriguing modern art!,"Very funny building, you feel like an explorer, finding works of art in all sorts of nooks and crannies. Lots of video-art, lots of Asian art, very nicely curated by a seriously good collector, I loved this museum. Full of surprises. It looked closed from the outside, I am glad I tried to open the door nevertheless. Not very many visitors, on a Sunday afternoon in January. Lots of time and space to look at everything without other people in the same room.", January 2019

8,5.0,Amazing and refreshing Gallery in a beautiful space.,, October 2018
9,5.0,Outstanding collection of contemporary works,"Fans of finely curated contemporary art collections will find much to enjoy at Arario Museum in Space. Open Tuesday to Sunday, it's nearby a number of other attractions including the Insadong-Gil shopping strip and Bukchon Hanok village. The museum is housed in a labyrinthine architecturally-designed 70s brick building shrouded in Ivy, the collection spanning all manner of sculpture, photography, installation, painting and interactive. Highly recommended.", July 2018
10,4.0,Amazing Museum,"We choose to add this place to our trip itinerary in the last day trip. The museum is absolutely beautiful and amazing. Lots of great picture can be taken here. Entrance fee is 10,000 KRW", March 2018
11,5.0,Beautiful space to experience modern art,"Arario might be one of my favorite museums in the world. The art contained inside is beautiful, intriguing, and many pieces are by world-renowned artists, but it's the space itself that really drew me in. The narrow nature of the building encourages unexpected, intimate views of the pieces, while its windows also frame interesting views of the surrounding neighborhood. The gift shop is cool too, offering all sorts of cool things by artists you won't find elsewhere. Highly recommend for a quiet afternoon in Seoul.", February 2017
12,4.0,Modern art is not for everyone,, August 2017
13,5.0,Impressive,"Quirky modern art museum, quirky in  the sense of the way exhibits are displayed. You follow a narrow labyrinthine route round the building watching your head for low ceilings in some places.Good cafe  too.", April 2017
14,5.0,One of a kind,"This place is one of the weirdest museums i ever been lol i really loved it! So unique! This is modern and contemporary art at his finest! Lots of great pictures can be taken here! Entrance is 10,000 KRW. This is really a must if you like museums", February 2017
15,5.0,Amazing,Our son enjoys modern art and so we choose to add this gallery to our trip itinerary. We found though we all thoroughly enjoyed this gallery and found it most interesting. My only comment would be there are alot of stairs to get up to the different levels and some are very narrow., December 2016
16,4.0,Eclectic modern art,"Fun collection (Warhol, Cindy Sherman Etc.) in an even more enchanting building. Winding staircase gets smaller as you get to the top. Architecturally stunning. Fantastic cafe in narrow glass room not to be missed! Great coffee stop with or without the collection. Right next to the Changdeokgung Palace, so you can't miss seeing the cafe from the street.", August 2016
17,5.0,Mind blowing!,"We unexpectedly stopped in here to get some air conditioning on a hot day, and had no idea that we were about to have one of the most profound art experiences of our lives. In particular, the Kohei Nawa pieces (the video piece in particular) are phenomenal. The architecture of the space creates a surreal experience. Go here!", June 2016
18,4.0,"Odd, yet enjoyable ","Just happened to brush by here while trying to go to the palace. What a strange museum. I am not by any means into the modern art scene, but I was glad I decided to check out this place. The building is absolutely beautiful and amazing to walk through. The exhibits were bizarre! One of the goals of modern art I believe is to make you feel uncomfortable and this museu certainly gets the job done.", May 2016
19,5.0,"A ""Must"" if you are into mdern art","An interesting building with even alot more interesting art. The owner, an artist himself, has put together a very interesting collection of modern international and asian art. Tip: if your journey leads you to Jeju-Island, dont miss the Arario-Museums there. They are the best I have seen in Modern art sofar.", April 2016
20,4.0,Mostly funny,, April 2016
21,5.0,"Excellent,even if you normally hate contemporary art!","Impressive, was initially reluctant as it was around 10euro in and I had never heard of the place, is right beside the royal palace, exhibitions are well laid out, unusual layout in each room, works include tracey emmins/marc quinn, lots of famous artists, meticulous detail, I don't normally like contemporary art but the museum is more of an experience itself than any gallery/museum I've been too. I didn't go to the cafe/restaurant as didn't have time but it looked very hip.", January 2016
