0,1.0,"If you like to see miserable animals in small tanks, sure...","Wasn’t aware that they had manatees before my visit. Manatees, seals and penguins all in VERY depressing enclosures. The manatee tank was completely bare and far too small for these animals. I found it quite upsetting and left swiftly after seeing these poor animals. Better", February 2020
1,3.0,Great for families with young children,I’ve been to many aquariums and thought this one was just okay. There were many families with small children and they were having a great time. There’s a lot of activities for kids . Interactive stations were cool. I went with my grown son and he didn’t enjoy it much. Definitely visit if you have small children. There’s a good variety of marine life. The layout of the place was great., January 2020
2,4.0,I wws blown away!,"We have a fantastic 'ocean world' in my home city, one of the best I've ever seen but this aquarium blew me away. It's huge and there's different themed areas as you go along. It's nicely set up and they had sealife that I had never seen in my life. I got a ticket online at Klook, which saved me about 20-25%. You can also get a flyer at the mall with a 15% discount coupon. The feedings are done by divers. The mermaid show I really wanted to see and waited around for an hour or so was a dissapointment...the 'mermaids' only swam up and down two or three times and then turnes into humans because that was their wish...I also didn't like the touching lab as I saw kids grabbingfish, starfish, poking them and taking them out and throwing them back in, no supervision. Other than that, great aquarium!!!", January 2020
3,3.0,Not worth the ticket price!,, January 2020
4,5.0,Best aquarium ,"Not a fan of aquariums but this one was really great! Huge variety of amazing fish is never seen before, very curious and strange aquatic creatures. Huge tanks so lots of room to see and makes me feel at least a little bit better about the fish being kept captive. It’s got a lot of crazy stuff to see and the price is worth it.", December 2019
5,5.0,Coex aquarium,"Bought 4 tickets to coex aquarium via Klook and it cost us approx SGD$25 per pax...with the experience! Many interesting sea creatures (penguins, sharks, walruses etc). especially love their interactive stations where they allow u to touch the sea creatures (eg starfish, clams, fishes). They even have a fish spa area! Very suitable for families with children:) My elderly parents loved it too! Totally worth the trip ❤️ the layout of the whole area is v well thought out. Foreigners also get to experience a free hanbok experience:)", December 2019
6,4.0,Awesome time ,"First time to see piranha.Had an awesome time in COEX. The aquarium is just beautiful and highly recommended if you coming with your kids. Educational yet fun. The only feedback from me, all the show were in Korean language which for a foreigner like us could not understand. Other than that everything was good. Another spot to visit if you’re coming to Korea.", December 2019
7,2.0,Priority doesnt seem to be the animals,, December 2019
8,5.0,Must See,"The Aquarium is great for all ages. If you are there at the right time, there is shark feeding at 1:30pm and feeding for other select tanks at 3:30pm. They are very efficient and effective with the use they have and some of the smaller aquarium tanks are artistic design and fun for all ages. There is also one are where kids can tough sea creatures and one tank you can put your hands in and the fish will nibble the dead skin off.  The Aquarium is a good size and there is one place in there halfway through if you have a hankering for a snack or some ice cream. There are many places outside the aquarium where you can eat before or after. There is a fun stamp book for kids as they go through to find stamps along the way.", November 2019
9,5.0,Aquarium with many varieties,"I make it a point to see this aquarium every time I visit Seoul. Many varieties and I like their collection of exotic shrimps. A must-see in Seoul. Great for children and adults. I usually schedule to see it when the weather is not good for outdoor photography. Easily accessible by subway and is close to the Bongeunsa Temple too. The COEX has a spectacular book library on the ground floor, so next time when you visit the aquarium, visit also the library and the nearby temple. This year they have a chipmunk, in addition to prairie dogs.", October 2019
10,5.0,Top Aquarium,Really nice aquarium . a nice place. had a lot of activities around it to. a must visit place and you will not be dissappointed., October 2019
11,3.0,Decent but average,"COEX aquarium is interesting, but definitely catered more towards kids and families.  I like aquariums and have been to many, so I would rate this one overall as average.  Not fantastic, but a decent way to kill 2 hours if one has time to kill as well as about $25 to blow on admission.  There are lockers to store you stuff (no bags allowed).  Would I go back?  Meh, probably not, but only because of the cost vs. what you get.  I am not saying it's a waste of time, just not what I would do again knowing what I know now.", November 2019
12,5.0,Awesome experience albeit entrance areas looks simple,The fun is in the inner areas. Navigate to see crabs and otters inside. They're amazingly huge and colourful., October 2019
13,5.0,Great Aquarium. Learned a lot!,"I paid full price for ticket 28,000 not realising there is online discount I would have paid less. It wasn’t originally on my plan of places to go but a rainy day brought me to Coex. The aquarium is really great with lots of varieties of fish I have never seen before being from Europe. It’s really kid friendly and you can learn a lot from the signs that are in korean and english! Really enjoyed it as a solo traveler.", October 2019

20,4.0,Do something different with kids,The aquarium is pretty good with an assortment of displays and some unique creatures. It’s not unlike other good and modern aquariums around the world.

22,4.0,A surprisingly nice aquarium in the heart of Seoul,, June 2019
23,4.0,wow there's Piranha!!,Big Aquarium inside the COEX Mall. Well maintained with lots of sea creatures to see. the main attractions were the diving penguins and the Piranha fish! very  informative and a good place to go to if you'd want to rest from the humid weather outside esp.during Summer Months in Seoul (June), June 2019
24,3.0,There are better things to do in Seoul.,"This aquarium is nothing special at all. Do not expect to be wowed by anything unique or creative. Unless you have never been to an aquarium or have children that demand you take them there, do not waste your time and skip this activity. There are better things to do in Seoul.", May 2019
25,5.0,Impressive ,"A really fun and visually impressive aquarium. The layout and design of each area is well thought out.

27,5.0,Amazing and entertaining ,My husband and I decided to visit the Coex Aquarium when we were in Coex mall and it was one of the highlights of our trip to Seoul! You can see many different interesting sea animals! Highly recommended!, March 2019
28,4.0,Good can add more description,Good Aquarium in the COEX shopping mall如果可以多點介紹部份或互動部份更好。例如短片介紹或iPad 遊戲等。 希望下次可以見到鯊魚位置表演 或其他關於魚類嘅介紹節目。, March 2019

33,4.0,Unique and Quirky,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Coex Aquarium - the first aquarium I have ever seen inside of a shopping mall. It was a bit overpriced, even with the tourist discount we got thanks to a travel brochure we picked up at the airport. The displays are quirky and unique, and even boasted some sea life, such as manatees, which we hadn't seen in any of our aquariums back home. Overall, a fun experience and a lovely outing if you have kids or if you are looking for something to do indoors on a very cold and/or rainy day.", March 2018
34,4.0,A good aquarium with varieties,"If you like aquariums, it is a must-see in Seoul. I liked to visit the aquarium whilst in Seoul (especially when the weather was bad and the parks were wet). This was my second visit and there was no noticeable change. However, watching the various creatures in the aquarium was quite relaxing and entertaining. This time, I tried to refine my camera skills for shooting tropical fishes; the results were not bad.", October 2018

39,5.0,interesting....aquatic view,, October 2018
40,4.0,"Octonauts, get ready!","This is a fun aquarium for young kids. In contrast to the educational scientific approach, this aquarium focuses on being fun and lively. First part of aquarium had ovtonauts related displays, then there is a place where you can touch “doctor fish” and star fish. There is also a shark area and some penguins. It’s a nice place to spend about 90 mins with kids under seven, but not much larger than that.", October 2018
41,5.0,"Good and nice, but pricy.",, May 2018
42,5.0,Lots to see and do,The price is a bit expensive if you're on a a budget but I think it's well worth it. The aquarium is so quirky with some of the displays but also very good at taking care of the animals. There are lots of different exhibits and activities to take part in this place would be especially good of you have children traveling with you as they would in my opinion love it. Plenty of bathrooms and vending machines so was never thirsty or needing the loo. All of the staff that I encountered were very nice too, December 2017
43,4.0,Great for Young Kids,"The aquarium was definitely better than I thought especially you pay 27,000 Korean won ($25). Well-designed with many different fishes I’ve never seen before. It’s an interactive experience where you can actually touch a few sea creatures. If your kids have never been to an aquarium, this is not a bad choice to make. It was enjoyable.", September 2018
44,5.0,A very enjoyable experience ,"Lots to see, very well displayed with lots of information also in English - many creatures that we hadn’t seen before in aquariums in England. Funny that they put fish in random things like a phone box and fridge. Would definitely recommend a visit if you like sea creatures. Loved the otters they were so cute !!", August 2018

46,3.0,"Average aquarium content, + for clean tank windows!",, July 2018
47,5.0,The most beautiful Aquarium I've ever seen,"This has got to be the most amazing attraction that I visited while in Seoul. The Aquarium is smartly divided into different sections so visitors (especially children) can learn a lot of things about marine life. It's great for families, friends, and couples too. The best thing about Coex aquarium is that a wide range of species can be found here and they all are displayed creatively. The mermaid show was amazing as well. The whole place is clean and spacious. I would love to visit it again!", July 2018
48,5.0,Feast for senses,Amazing variety of sea life displayed in most imaginative surroundings like kitchen sinks and fire extinguishers. And why not!! Impressive larger animals like rays were fascinating. This place is more than its location under a super mall promises. The only negative was missing supervision as children were touching some petting animals much more than recommended - parental guidance is obviously not enough..., September 2017

54,3.0,Good if you have small kids,"We saw great reviews about this Aquarium so stopped by. I guess if you have small kids, it's a great place for them to wander around. If not, well, don't expect Sea World. It's a pretty compact (& a bit handmade) aquarium that is part of the mall.", May 2018
55,4.0,Worth a visit,"It is surprisingly large given that it is situated inside the COEX, an expensive place in the heart of the city. I had visited numerous large aquariums but still managed to find something interesting. There was a locker facility (at a small charge) and that was helpful. The staff were particularly helpful although they did not speak much English.", April 2018

We were amazed at how beautifully maintained and clean all the tanks in the aquarium are. The animals seem very well taken care of. We especially enjoyed the quirky section of the aquarium where fish are living in all sorts of funny places - a telephone booth, glass lanterns, tupperware inside a refrigerator, etc. It was entertaining for our baby as well as us adults. I would definitely go back!", December 2017
60,2.0,Boring Aquarium,, October 2017

62,3.0,Not very big but an easy way to spend a couple of hours.,"The aquarium is tucked away in the mall, but easy enough to find with adequate signs pointing the way. It was a bit underwhelming but large enough to keep you entertained for a couple of hours.", October 2017
63,5.0,Best Aquarium ever,I've done some Aquariums but this one is really well-done. There are a lot of animals that I didn't have the chance to see before that day. The visit will take you around 2 or 3 hours. The entrance is around 20 euros but it's totally worth it :), May 2017
64,5.0,incredible!,i was first a little taken-aback by how up close and personal you are with apex predators and the lot... it was absolutely a one of a kind unique experience  that none of us will forget! if youre out here for some unholy reason do yourself a favor and dedicate a couple hours here!!!, June 2017
65,3.0,Ok,"It was an ok experience, but way too expensive for what it has to offer. Not impressive and the entrance was around 25000w.", March 2018
66,4.0,It was very good,"Many species. Not only under sea habitats. So very interesting, large main pool with big sharks and turtles. Worth it", March 2018
67,5.0,surprisingly worth it,"you'd think an aquarium inside the basement of a mall would be lacklustre, but wow you'd be wrong. This place is huge and has so many different areas. You can spend a couple hours in here easily. It has pretty much all the staples of a good aquarium. There's a shark tank, otters, an underwater tunnel, educational things, jelly fish, and some extra trendy stuff. It isn't the best aquarium I've been to by far, but it gets a 5star simply because it was way better than expected. Easily accessible by subway and you can spend a whole day here if you like malls. Watch a movie, eat some food, go to a temple across the street, go to an arcade all on a subway stop. This place is also one stop on bus from the airport for about 15 bucks. So even a great stop over spot when in Korea", November 2017
68,4.0,Great afternoon activity,Our family of five had a wonderful time in the Coex Aquarium! Many different areas to explore and Santa was diving with the fish! There were lots of kids and families but never felt too crowded. Lots to see and fun exhibits! There was a food festival on the front of the Coex on this particular year day and we had a great lunch! The Aquarium was the perfect place to get out of the cold!, December 2017

72,5.0,The best aquarium I have ever been ,"This is the best aquarium I have been so far. The environment is really good, kids have opportunity to touch in some kind of attractions alive, the glasses surrounding the aisle give us an impressive sensation and kids are surprised all the time.", December 2017
73,4.0,“Interesting display of fishes”,"Been to Seoul a couple of times and this is our first visit to the aquarium.  The aquarium is located in coex mall with plenty of shopping and restaurants. The aquarium itself wasn’t big, you can basically cover the whole place in a hour or so. There are some very innovative display of the fishes in this place, eg a water dispenser filled with fishes, a fire extinguisher acts as a fish tank etc. Pretty interesting! The rest are pretty much your usual aquarium stuffs. Go if you are traveling with young kids, they will love the place.", December 2017
74,1.0,Desapointed!,"This Aquarium it's nothing special! It depends a lot on what have you saw before. So, if you have been before in great aquariums forget about this one, it's small and has nothing special to see and it seams that they don't take very well care about the animals there. But if you are with little kids and don't know what to do i thing you can go there and enjoy.", March 2017
75,4.0,Coex Aquarium with lots of fishes,I visited the Coex Aquarium with a friend. There were plenty of different types of fishes and is an interesting place for fish lovers. I’m posting photos to show the fishes., October 2017
76,5.0,Water wonderland,"This is a must see for visitors to Seoul. Wonderfully laid out, allow time to see all the exhibits. They are diverse, and children are especially catered for with interactive games. One of the best laid out aquariums we have visited. Many species to excite interest with waterfalls and ponds an attractive addition.", October 2017
77,4.0,Well designed aquarium,"Prefer this aquarium to lotte world aquarium, since it felt as though it was larger and had a larger variety of marine lives. A lot of thinking seemed to have been placed into the designing of the aquarium's layout and furnishing to elude an air of cozy ambiance throughout the visit, even though I felt that some tanks might be too children-friendly for adults - had to squat down at most of the first section. The staff at the ticket counter could have been friendlier as well, as she looked irritated when she found out that I couldn't understand Korean and that she had to repeat herself in another language.", November 2017

81,4.0,Great fun for small children ,"This place is much better than the one at the Coex Centre in Seoul. My 7-year-old had a great time there, especially feeding the fish. Really liked the variety of fish and animals. You can buy discounted tickets through Gmarket. You can do the aquarium in the morning and Kidsania in the afternoon if you have enough energy. Kids will have a perfect day.", October 2017

87,5.0,Beautiful aquarium,"Spent 3 hours here one afternoon.  Well worth the price; make sure you take a picture at the poster in the mall for 10% off.  It's inside the mall, and a little hard to find, but once inside, it is a blast! So many different fish tanks, and so much to see.  The shark tank at the end is amazing, and big enough to really make you feel like you're inside the ocean!  Well worth the price.", September 2017
88,2.0,"Loved the Aquarium, hated all the noise","I truly enjoyed the aquarium and the way they had some of their displays set up. The only downside for me was that there were several very young school groups who were all yelling and running. They have one spot where they play soothing music and you can fit in front of a massive aquarium where sharks and rays glide by in front of you. It would have been a great spot to sit and video the beautiful creatures but there several groups of very loud teenage Korean boys running through it ruining your video and generally ruining the whole feeling. It would have been an awesome experience if the staff had maintained some kind of order, but most of them appeared to be high school kids themselves.", August 2017

99,4.0,A really nice aquarium.,"We went here with our 2 boys, aged 6 & 2.They had a blast looking at all the different fish, stingrays, sharks, turtles and other sea life. They even had some other animals such as Beavers, Otters and Penguins. This aquarium was nicely laid out with 16 different stations. I would allocate around 1-2 hours for this attraction. I think some of the main features of this aquarium are the Huge ""Ocean Kingdom"" with all the sharks, The Fish in Wonderland which show fish in all diferent types of unique aquariums, The Amazonia World which show marine life from The Amazon River and The Marine Touch Lab to where the kids can touch certain marine life. This attraction is stroller friendly. My only drawback would be that this attraction is sort of on the pricey side with adults costing 25,000 each, youths 22,000 and children (3-12) 19,000 krw.", June 2017
100,5.0,Always great to visit,"This was our second visit to the aquarium.  Hours of wonder and fun with the fish and other animals, including the otters, beavers, penguins...

102,4.0,Nice aquarium at fantastic mall,"We have been twice. The first time we absolutely loved this aquarium. The second time it was a little different. Zoos and aquariums are always a little sad when looking at how small the enclosures are for the animals/sea creatures. If you are able to look passed this then you will enjoy the aquarium very much, like we did the first time!", April 2017
103,4.0,A fun place with your loved ones ,"I enjoyed this place with my wife and we had a fun time checking out the fish and it was a lovely place and when you are done can you eat lunch in Coex. It is not a must see, but fun place if you lived her for a longer time or if you have kids.", April 2017
104,3.0,Aquarium,This was a nice sized aquarium where you could get close to the fish and exhibits.  It would be a great place to go with kids., May 2017
105,5.0,Amazing!,"We were pleasantly surprised that Coex Aquarium can rival the SEA Aquarium in Singapore.  Considering that Coex Aquarium was inside a mall, we did not expect much.  We were pleasantly surprised to see that it was very modern and had as much attractions as SEA Aquarium in Singapore.  They even had penguins and huge sharks which my kids really enjoyed watching.  And for its price, it was well worth it!", May 2017
106,3.0,Value for money is not so good,"Frankly speaking the value for money is not so good in Coex Aquarium. There are not so many animals here, this attraction is more for chldren than for adults even though there were some interesting spots. However I will not recommend a visit to this aquarium and if I could come back to the past I would save 25000 Wons/ticket and skip this attraction. COEX shopping mall itself is not very interesting also, however it is a kind of must-see in Seoul as it is considered to be one of the biggest in the world.", May 2017

109,3.0,Could be better,"We love visiting the aquarium at every single city we travel if it has one. Seoul was not an exception and we chose COEX as we were told a lot about it. The entrance was easily found. Staff was friendly. The aquarium seemed to be large and well organized with some areas where guest could play with the fish and ocean creatures. The big fish and penguin, however, looked so tired and boring. Since we were there around 11am with no show at that time so we did not really enjoy it. But I think it could be much better once the renovation is completed.", April 2017
110,4.0,Nice and Cool!,"This is one of a good places to visit during in Seoul, especially for the aquamarine lovers.

113,5.0,An Underwater Adventure,"Coex Aquarium is a combination of Marine Fish & Brackish Water fishes in the Amazon jungle. It highlights fishes in their natural habitats able to live together with other kinds. For the marine fishes, there's a section where children are allowed to handle live corals, starfishes, hernit crabs & even a baby octopus. There is also a tank full of Piranhas looking so aggressive & unfriendly. It usually takes about 90 mins to complete everything. Coming out of the Aquarium, you will be able to buy souvenirs to bring home.Highlight is the feeding times when 4 divers get into the water to hand feed the fishes, octopus, sting ray & mantle ray. They also performed some water aerobics to entertain the audience in the theatre.", April 2017
114,4.0,Well presented,"Coex Aquarium is fun and interesting especially for young kids. My daughter is 3.10 years old, thus, still free; payment starts at 4 if I am not mistaken. The map at the start of the ""journey"" makes going around more interesting as one needs to complete the stamp from several stops and get a post card after. There are a lot of variety of sea creatures and they eat healthy foods, fruits and veggies! A nice place to visit and takes around 1-2 hours in total. =)", April 2017
115,4.0,Good aquarium but overpriced,, April 2017
116,5.0,Fun & Educational in Convenient Location,"Some people might balk at the price, but it's worth it if you go as a group. It's a very nice aquarium with plenty of English information for visitors. We went as a school trip for students who were mostly English speakers and they really enjoyed it.", December 2016
117,3.0,Good for children,"The place is overrun with children and definitely geared towards them in my opinion.  We were 3 adults, and we of course still enjoyed all the sea life, but we did not enjoy the crowds.  I would avoid weekends if possible.", August 2016
118,4.0,Good place to chill and stroll,Enough to see when you want to get out of the cold. There are good signage to each exhibit. Before the entrance and inside there are lockers for storing your bags., February 2017
119,4.0,New fish I hadn't seen,"This is a standard aquarium in that there are lots of tanks of fish. However they had one room laid out with tanks showing what would be from the beginning of the Han river to the sea. It also has what lives in a paddy field. There are unusual fish tanks (one uses a refrigerator ). There were also otters, beers and manatees.", February 2017
120,4.0,Coex,"Good aquarium. Entrance fee is 25,000 KRW. Great location in Gangnam. The one in Busan is probably better", February 2017
121,5.0,Worthwhile outing ,"This aquarium started out ho-hum...then got interesting! I especially liked the 'Dr Fish' that nibbled my fingers. My kids especially liked the touch-and-feel section as well as the microscopes that magnified tiny aquatic creatures. I'm happy we went. Just outside a metro stop - super easy to access. Part of an underground mall, so plenty of dining and coffee options for before or after.", January 2017
122,5.0,Great family diversion,"This is a nice aquarium with some unique features I hadn't seen previously. We enjoyed the uniquely Korean fish tank displays (in a coke machine, a water cooler, a phone booth, etc.), and the sardine show (where divers divert the schooling fish in various directions) is a spectacle to behold. Among the many exhibits is a big shark tank with some interesting varieties and some of the largest sharks and rays I recall seeing at an aquarium. The ""doctor fish"" (nibbling pedicure fish) exhibit was a fun hands-on experience. Lots to see here, and a great place to spend a few hours with the kids in inclement weather, especially since it's attached to a mall with lots of restaurants. We didn't find it too crowded, especially considering that it was a weekend during the cold winter. Note that the experience is linear, so you'll need to pass through the entire facility to get out.", December 2016
123,4.0,COEX Aquarium Visit,"This a nice aquarium in the middle of the city and about five minutes from the nearest subway stop.  However, it is far too crowded, making it difficult to view the exhibits in a relaxing manner.  The exhibits are modern and professional.", June 2016
124,3.0,Typical Tropical Aquarium,, December 2016
125,4.0,Interesting,"I didn't expect a huge Aquarium inside a mall. It looked small when viewed from the entrance, but you'll be surprised how bit it actually is. It had different themes and a good variation of fish and other animals.", March 2016
126,4.0,Good experience at aquarium in Gangnam mall,"We visited the aquarium at the CoEx Mall one evening before closing.  It was over $20 for admission.  A little more than expected.  We enjoyed our hour going through all the various exhibits.  They even had a beaver exhibit with all the different aquatic animal and fish exhibits.  There are vary many exhibits and the interesting thing about them is the design of the tanks.  For example in one area, there were fish swimming in a kitchen sink.  Also, there is a tank where you can put your fingers in and the fish will nibble off your dead skin cells.  They didn't seem to interested that evening.  Overall, we enjoyed the time we spent here.", October 2016
127,4.0,Less than I'd expect from a city like Seoul,"This aquarium leaves a lot to be desired for a city of this size. In my opinion Busan is a much better aquarium. The majority of the exhibit is comprised of indigenous fresh water fish, however they do have a nice selection of sharks (one of which ate another shark in 2015 and can be seen on CNN online).", November 2016
128,4.0,Kids Enjoyed! ,, December 2016
129,3.0,Good place for kids,"Just an aquarium with some national Korean touches. It's not the biggest one among the oceanariums I have visited, but it is obvious the object is very well maintained. The entrance fee is a little high for such a place. Good place for educational trips with kids.", November 2016
130,4.0,Worth to watch,"It's a mid range aquarium, not small not that much big, and full of families with kids. Specialy during weekends it's very busy and crowded, but koreans are very quiet and polite.You won't be regretful after spending one or two hours there.", May 2016
131,2.0,Good as a school trip.,"It's not that it's bad, but don't waste your time in Seoul on this attraction.  If you are travelling with children it will be a nice thing to do, but don't expect something special.", October 2016
132,5.0,Children's paradise,The aquarium presents a large and rare variety. The whole arrangement is with due consideration of children. The informative boards are in simple but catchy language to attract the kids. And really the kids enjoy it very much. It has a high educative value and is a 'must visit' place for children., November 2016
133,4.0,Great for family with kids,Their aquarium is pretty huge with huge sea animals too. Great for kids. And nice place to take picture., November 2016
134,3.0,Small and kinda smelly,We finished seeing everything in less than an hour. It's a very small aquarium and not really worth going to. You're better off just exploring Coex Mall itself., October 2016
135,1.0,Really?,, October 2016
136,4.0,Way better than I thought!!!,"I found that it is one of the great aquarium (probably the best one) in Korea!! I didn't expect that much, just thought it would be normal one. But it was really nice and I did like it!! A lot kind of fishes and etc..... The best part was the glass tunnel there I felt like I was under the real sea!", October 2016
137,5.0,Amazing. ,, October 2016
138,4.0,Good enough,"Visited the Aquarium with a 3 year old and a 7 year old. The Aquarium isn't as grand and spectacular as some other Aquariums in Asia but considering it is right in the city and above a mall, it is not too bad. There are some fun exhibits for children. Some quite interactive, keeping young children busy. Visit for the entertainment aspect of it and yoi won't be disappointed. Expect to spend about 1.5 to 2 hours.", October 2016
139,3.0,Not quite the Aquariums found in Other Cities,"This Aquarium has some Limited Species of Fishes, it is Not that Attractive and a bit Pricey on the Entry Fee.It might Excite the Kids to see some Fishes, but not worth the Entry fee.", September 2016
140,2.0,"Not good value for money, average",I have been to plenty of aquariums over the world. The one in COEX mall was priced 15000 won back in 2012 and showed nothing much for the entrance fee. I found only the jelly fish section better than the rest. Entirely forgettable experience, November 2015
141,4.0,aquarium in a mall,I spent about 35 minutes total looking through the aquarium.  I think the price reflects the fact that the aquarium is in the middle of a city., February 2016
142,3.0,Correct aquarium,"Not as big and impressive as other aquariums in the world, you can spend some pleasant times to visit.", September 2016
143,4.0,Amazing!!,I recommend a visit to the aquarium expecially with kids of course. It is really amazing and there are also some exibitions during the feeding hours really nice( unfortunately only in korean but it is amazing the same). It is better to get information about the hours when you arrive., August 2016
144,5.0,Fun Aquarium ,"We were there in Aug. My 11  year old had a blast. You can touch certain fish/starfish and snails. Is not thay big but bigger than you would imagine since it is inside the mall. They have shows, and overall a good experience.", August 2016
145,4.0,Lovely place for kids and adults ,"My four year old and I love going to COEX aquarium. One can easily spend about 3-4 hours in the aquarium. It's not just viewing the lovely displays but also the shows like feeding the Sharks, penguin. You can touch and feel starfish which is fun. I love the display which has the fish that eats your dead skin. There is a innovative section where they have aquariums made with stuff like refrigerator, vending machine etc. definitely worth a trip.", August 2016
146,5.0,Lovely aquarium,I loved this aquarium! It was lovely with many species of fishes & huge sharks. Its not over crowded & also pretty diverse with other animals other than fishes., July 2016

150,5.0,my parents and daughter enjoyed the aquarium,, August 2016
151,3.0,"Not bad, pricy ","It is located inside the Coex mall but it is closer to the Bongeunsa station. The aquarium is definitely geared more towards kids. You can stick your hands in one of the tanks where they keep those small fish that munch on your dead skin. The aquarium is not that big, but they have penguins, otters, manatees, sea turtles, beavers, sharks and rabbits (???). It's a nice place to chill on a hot summer day.", August 2016
152,4.0,Bizarre at times,"This aquarium starts off like any other aquarium but then you get to the area of tanks that are shaped like a telephone box or fire extinguisher (same size a real one). The are also some rabbits, chipmunks, prairie dogs and Guinea pigs. It was quite crowded so it was difficult to see sometimes. There is a touch pool with some cool things like the sea pineapple and sea slug. There is only a small cafe which sells ice cream and a small selection of drinks inside the aquarium area, but a lot of good places around. Some quite pricey. You can get line number nine right to the door on the subway. Get off at Bongeusa station. This station wasn't on the map I picked up so I guess my map is old. As i didn't know about this station we caught line 7 to Cheongdam and walked down past the temple.", August 2016
153,5.0,Weekday adventure with Sammuel octopus ,"I've been here twice. I highly recommend avoiding weekends due to wall to wall crowds. Yesterday was a Wednesday and we had a great time. There weren't too many people there. We were able to do the moving tunnel twice. It's popular for a reason. It's a beautiful, creative, innovative aquarium with many artistic and shaped displays. There are lockers to place your backpacks and shopping bags. Inside, there's a snack shop with churros, ice cream, and coffee. There are stamp books for the kids ands touch pool with uniquely korean sea creatures like sea pineapples  in the touch pool. Line 9 takes you right to it. Near PF changs. Go in the mall and its to the right. Conan O Brian's pet octopus, Samuel) is in the crab display! ( he is an American TV star)", August 2016
154,5.0,Thoroughly enjoyable aquarium experience at the gigantic COEX Mall complex.,"We were very impressed with this attraction overall. Great care and planning, fun design elements and a variety of animals (including native species you'd be unlikely to encounter) made for an informative and entertaining experience. As a pair of adults (no kids) we'd recommend 1.5 - 2 hours for a leisurely encounter. With kids, perhaps adjust time expectations. This being Korea, great selfie opportunities abound and the tanks also lent themselves for some great pix and video to share w/ friends.  -- A tip for couples: we went late in the day on a weekday & that cut down on the kid-traffic, making the trip through a peaceful and soothing chance to unwind.", August 2016
155,5.0,Coex Mall and Aquarium,Very nice aquarium with a wide variety of animals. I will post more photos later. Lots of interactive things for children to do to make learning fun.

158,5.0,Cool place to take the kids for 1HR!,"Very nice aquarium with interacting activities for the kids do like touching water creatures.  Cool designs with fish tanks.  Highly recommend this place if you come during the hot summer months.  After you are done, you can walk around the mall which has very nice movie theater, duty free shop and Hyundai Dept store at the other end of the COEX.  I personally like this place then Seaworld!", June 2016
159,4.0,Nice place to take your kids,"This aquarium is not up to the standards of Long Beach or Toronto, but in a city that's a little short on activities for kids, it's not a bad place to spend an hour or so.", July 2016
160,5.0,Informative,, May 2016
161,5.0,Fun afternoon,"The aquarium has a wide variety of sea creatures. It was a very open area for the large amount of visitors and was pretty clean. I especially enjoyed how visitors could interact with some of the sea creatures (doctor fish, touching a starfish, etc.) and learn about some of the common illnesses in fish by looking under a microscope. The displays of the fish are also very creative; for example, one fish tank looked like a telephone box, and another looked like refrigerator.", June 2016
162,5.0,Good Aquarium,Good aquarium to visit if you have not been to one ... but if you have been to the one in some of the other places (Singapore/Thailand/China) then you may not find it as special, September 2015

172,5.0,Whole world at one place,"The COex aquarium has been designed to entertain all age groups. The money is worth spending. it takes 3 hours at least to cover. As compared to Dubai, Singapore and London, I found this to be bigger and more number of fish types", June 2016
173,3.0,Not Bad but Not Brilliant,, May 2016
174,5.0,Pleasantly surprised.,"The only other Korean Aquarium we have been to is in Busan which was small. We were nervous about the Coex since it was in a mall. There was no problems! We went early on a Sunday and it was not as packed as we feared it would be. Our little ones, 3.5 and almost 2, had a blast. The only thing we didn't care for where the touch exhibits. Those poor aquatic animals. But since our kids enjoyed it, we would certainly go back.", June 2016

179,5.0,Great aquarium at a conference center!,"We were pleasantly surprised by the quality and size of this aquarium.  Lots of great exhibits with a variety of species from around the world, as well as many tanks highlighting the fish of Korea.  Exhibits were cleverly displayed, most signs provided in both Korean and English.  On a weekday late morning, we had the place almost to ourselves with very few other visitors in sight.  This would be a great rainy day activity; as it was, it filled several hours before we had to leave for the airport at the nearby CALT center neighboring COEX.  Great family activity, although my husband and I enjoyed it even without kids.  It might be considered a bit pricey after the low cost entrance fees to the royal palaces and free entrance to the War Museum, but once inside we had no regrets over paying the $20-22 fee.  Well worth it!", May 2016
