0,1.0,Not possible to book ticket for non resident foreigner. ,Tried to book a ticket but apparently they don‚Äôt like non resident foreigners. To book you need to become member and membership is only allowed for Koreans and resident foreigners.  This is actually pure discrimination and a shame for the beautiful and friendly Korea., December 2019
1,4.0,Good experience!!!,"Came here for a free concert. Inside the hall was big and nice. The exterior is nice too, beautiful architecture. Outside, nice place to roam around with nature and have a nice meal on the bench. You can also walk around here, look at the beautiful fall leaves and trees.", October 2019

3,3.0,the place to go when you want to experience something new,"No need to take the bus, you can walk from the nearest train station to Seoul Arts Center for about 10 minutes. Intriguing aesthetics but not particularly remarkable architecturally; decent spatial organisation but an architectonic bore.", May 2019

6,3.0,Not welcoming to English speakers,"I've been to the Frida Kahlo exhibit and the incorrectly titled - Picasso and Cubism exhibit (January 2019) at the Hangaram.  Hangaram museum does not have English docents (unlike Leeum) , English pamphlets or English descriptions of artwork.  The museum features important shows but is not interested in attracting anyone other than locals.  Most preposterous - The PIcasso & Cubism exhibit had as their piece de resistance - Picasso's Three Dancers from 1925 - not the original but a rug with the image!.  The marketing poster of the exhibit features this image giving the impression  that the exhibit would include the original and not a rug that has the licensed image.  Also, although the show was extremely impressive and featured a number of Delaunay's most important work- the curator really should have come up with a less misleading name for the show.  There was hardly any work by PIcasso and Braque.", January 2019

8,1.0,Terribly Disappointing Customer Service ,"My friend and I have been looking forward to seeing The Nutcracker for months. I couldn't book the tickets online because their website booking system was all in Korean and for members only. So I called and booked the tickets over the phone. I guess the woman who helped me book them last month didn't understand what I wanted and booked us tickets for a morning concert, instead of The Nutcracker, on the same day. Upon discovery of the mistake, they were execptionally polite. But only had one pair of seats left at a price higher than we were hoping to pay. I certainly didn't expect them to give the ‚Ç©90 000 tickets to us for free...but certainly at a discounted price. I understand that it was mostly sold out, but COME ON! It was entirely their fault we had the wrong tickets and couldn't get the ones we wanted earlier. And they had seats available. Disappointing follow through on a customer service mistake.", December 2018
9,5.0,World class facilities.,"I went hear to listen to a chamber recital as part of the Goethe Institut of Korea's celebration.  The parking was very easy to access though I can see some accessibility issues for handicapped.  The smaller IBK Chamber Hall we went into was well designed - good acoustics, sightlines and acoustics.  The lobby has a small music store with a collection of good CDs and LPs for sale.  The outdoor grounds are pleasant as it is set against the mountainside.", September 2018

I showed the reservation no for the ticket counter employee and she gave the tickets easly. We enjoyed the concert and when we finished we went to watch the music fountain its so beautiful.", April 2018
15,4.0,The Seoul Art Center Concert Hall  for the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra concert featuring English tenor Ian Bostridge,"I visited the Seoul Art Center in Seoul Korea and attended the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra concert featuring a world-renowned English tenor Ian Bostridge.  The hall acoustics was great and my seat was in the first low of the left-side lower balcony.  Starting with Debussy's Three Noctures for Orchestra the concert continued the presentation of Benjamin Britten's Nocturnes for Tenor and Small Orchestra Ensemble.  The final piece was Gustav Holst's the Planet.  Among them, I enjoyed the Benjamin Britten's work the most.  Ian Bostridge's voice is not of high=strength and volume.  However, his intricate tone quality, the interpretation and presentation was very artistic and moving.  After the concert I have returned listening his Schubert, including ""Die scheone mullerin"" and ""Der Winterreise"".  Brave! Ian Bostridge.", March 2018

Chinese, Thai, Australian, and North American tourists rely on English translations; we should at least have an opportunity to understand what the museum has to offer.  To be this exclusive sends a message that foreigners are not welcome.  You guys are hosting the Olympics in two weeks?", February 2018
18,4.0,Seoul Arts Center - Giacometti Exhibit,"Enjoyed visiting the Giacometti Exhibit at Seoul Arts Center - at the Hangaram Design Museum. Nice exhibit showing details of Alberto Giacometti's life, education and evolution as an artist. Would have liked to have seen a bit more english descriptions since I don't speak/read Korean.

20,1.0,No online reservations in English for almost 12 months now!,"Seoul Arts Center's English online reservation service has been unavailable for almost one year now. I have used this facility to buy my tickets for ballet performances - when ticket sales open there is a mad rush to get a seat in a good place in the theater, all the best seats have always gone before ticket sales open - I am told they go to the sponsors.Telephone bookings are not satisfactory - last time by the time the girl had slowly taken my details she then told me ""sorry the seats have gone now!"" seats were only available 8 rows further back!

23,3.0,A huge and great complex for music listening but...,"Seoul Arts Center has a large footprint with several music halls of international standard. The acoustics of the music halls are of very high standard and so are the world-renowned musical guests who come from far away places. In these two aspects, this complex is truly first class. Moreover, the back side of the complex is surrounded by a relatively small mountain range and hence, the surrounding is quite peaceful with off&on arts exhibition, etc. Generally a nice place to spend a lazy hour or two listening to wonderful concert or alternatively walking around or even going up the mountain which has easy access from the complex. What this complex really lacks is first class hospitality services area. Average to poor restaurants, mediocre shops, mediocre coffee shops, etc. This is generally true for Korea which has first class hardware but the software is lacking, although improvement is under way. But sadly, not yet!", November 2016
24,5.0,Finest operas and ballets in Seoul,"In my first out of four years in Seoul, I was a season subscriber to SAC. This allowed me to enjoy the various operas, concerts and ballets presented in 2013. I wasn't able to renew my subscription the following years due to long hours at work. but I otherwise went whenever I had spare time. The quality of the performances is very high, and I am constantly impressed by the high technical skills of the instrumentalists in the concerts.", June 2016

They have had a Studio Ghibli, Steam Punk, Impressionist Art (Van Gogh), and Freida Kahlo in just the last four years. The musical performances are also good, but you might need a Korean friend to help you get tickets.", October 2016

34,5.0,Tamara de Lempicka and Alphonse Mucha Double Header,"You couldn't luck out much better than to see two exhibitions of the Queen of Art Deco and the Father of Art Nouveau.  Tamara de Lempicka for the first time in Korea, and Alphonse Mucha for the second time here in 3 years.  Both give a great retrospective on the work of the artists, and the Mucha exhibition shows a very surprising angle on the fact that a majority of Japanese Mange Anime is highly influenced by his style and graphics.  All my friends said ""No way!"" but the evidence is irrefutable.  Although the weather in December was not conducive to experience the outside grounds and overall magnitude of this wonderful Center, we loved our experience and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Seoul.", December 2016

The venue is very nice because there are different halls, shops, gallery, and coffee shops. It's recommended that you plan your transportation in advance because I had a tough time getting a taxi at night after the concert, especially with so many people competing for the limited number of available taxis. I would recommend that you attend an event there. Photos attached.", May 2016
50,4.0,For Musicals and Art,"I haven't been to their shows but I always go for their art. They are able to get great exhibition curated for people in Seoul, so it is always the best.

I visited there for Design Art Fair 2016. Many local artists exhibited their creative art works, ranging from handicraft, design accessories to pop art objects. It was a very good taste of the latest design development in Korea. Highly recommend to check in advance if you find any interesting show/ exhibitions before you go as it is not very close to the center of the city.", May 2016
56,5.0,Great Cultural complex in South Korea,"Fantastic building, with over 2 milloin visitors a year. It houses the Opera house, Music Hall and has over 2 million visitors each year.

58,4.0,Great to go with kids on summer nights.,"The SAC is not very large but has a constant selection of art exhibitions, theatre performances and activities. It also holds lighted, musical fountain shows during the summer in front of which there are stalls of food from various countries. The only reason I did not rate this place as excellent is because of the heavy traffic that surrounds this area during rush hours, and its distance from the metro station!", August 2015

I would highly recommend this to anyone and everyone!", April 2015
61,5.0,Highlight of our trip,"There are so many thing to see here. We went to hear a symphony and our seats were fantastic. They bring in some amazing artists and it is worth it for you to look at their schedule (some English available, and we bought our tickets easily online and picked up at will-call) to attend something here. The subway stops very close to the center, so it is very accessible. Our program ended at 10:30 pm, but the subway is pretty crowded until around midnight, so it was very safe for us to take the 30 minute journey back to our hotel.", November 2015

72,4.0,"Good shows, aging facility","Hangaram Art Museum is a great place to see traveling exhibitions.  As a resident of Seoul, I come here to see the work of artists that I would otherwise have to take a long flight to see.  For example, the museum is currently running shows of the work of Botero and Modigliani.  The facility is showing its age, though.  It needs a bit of freshening up.  The art shop in the lobby has recently had a facelift and looks much better for it.", August 2015
73,5.0,Good place to see local and international shows & exhibitions,"As a Seoul resident, I'm very fond of this place.   I come here several times a year to see exhibtions and concerts.  The largest hall features operas and musicals, including ones from overseas, while the smaller hall -- which has fantastic acoustics -- showcases orchestral and symphonic music.  In addition, there are several art exhibition spaces that host blockbuster shows.  Botero and Modigliani shows are running currently.  The complex also features shopping and fine dining.  There are also walking trails on the hill behind the complex.", August 2015
74,4.0,"Very interesting Arts Center, just on account of its architecture, but too much to see in only a day","Regular art exhibitions and performances are held in this place. Generally, an exhibition does not allow you to take photographs, and you have to place your bags and other valuable stuff inside a locker and remember the locker code. I found that the Munhwa Jeondang area where the art exhibitions are held is only 1/3 of the Arts Center, because there are also a musical hall for performance, an academy for the arts somewhere behind the Jeondang exhibition halls. A day is simply not enough for combing through all the various exhibitions, even if you are very ambitious, and I think that you will come back for more! The architecture is rather interesting, and combines Victorian and abstract modernist designs with Korean concepts.", September 2014

78,5.0,Huge arts venue with different areas of interest,"A little far out of city centre but huge place with multiple art museums of different interests and performance venues (eg. contemporary art, graphic arts, cartoon and illustration, music) so there is something for everyone. Although was very disappointed that none of the official (and unofficial) websites mentioned the closure of the Calligraphy Museum for renovations (till sometime in 2016) as that was the main purpose of my visit there.

The SAC is not far away from there but not easy to find; the hopper bus, took about 45 minutes through the traffic so I suggest you take a taxi from the station, for the less than 5 minute drive. Getting back to the subway afterwards is simple - follow the crowds to the main exit where you get onto the green hopper bus no 11 for the 5 minute drive to the subway.  There is lots to do at the SAC so get there an hour or two before your performance starts.", June 2015

84,5.0,Chamber Symphony Orchestra Concert was amazing,"I have visited two art exhibitions, done one print making class and attended a performance by the Chamber Symphony Orchestra at the Seoul Arts Center and can't recommend it more highly!  The Rothko and Print exhibits were amazing, though nothing was in english and there was no english brochure we could use, but since the Rothko exhibit came from the National Gallery of Art their online tutorial about Rothko was amazingly helpful!  As part of the Print exhibit we paid to make our own prints which was very fun, the artist guiding us through the process spoke perfect english as he had lived in TN for a good while.  And the Chamber Symphony Orchestra concert on Mother's Day was a wonderful gift!  It was a little warm in the auditorium that day so make sure to wear layers. The sound was perfect and playing quite moving.  We also enjoyed the musical fountain show outdoors afterwards.  Since we live in Seoul we drove and parked in the convenient lots right there. It's better to pay inside for a quick exit!", May 2015

87,5.0,Choices.,With multiple theaters and 4-8 events a day I can always find an interesting performance. I gravitate towards the soloists in the two smaller halls. But have seen the larger productions in the opera hall. I show up a half hour before the show. Buy a ticket. Get a glass of the house red at the small wine shop in the lobby and thoroughly enjoy my time there., March 2015

94,4.0,Expansive center caters to all five senses ... including taste!,"A respite from the hustle and bustle of city streets, SAC (its nickname) is a large complex on the southern edge of Seoul backed up against a wooded mountain that's a bit hard to reach (need to take a mini-bus for 5 minutes from the nearest subway, Nambu Bus terminal station) but if you have tickets to a concert, opera, musical or whatnot, try and come early to savour the atmosphere and stroll about the grounds. They've built up the area to include a myriad of cafes and restaurants, so you could in theory have dinner and coffee before an evening show (but probably not after; they don't stay open late if my memory serves me...) They may also have some art exhibits, and there's a traditional music institute on the premises that might display some instruments. It also has authentic traditional Korean musical performances at reasonable prices (much better than the downtown tourist shows..), so inquire into that if that's your thing. You will find some English speaking staff at the main building, and overall a sophisticated cultured (i.e., ""well-dressed"") crowd comes here so if you don't want to turn heads you should dress it up a bit.", May 2014
95,5.0,Creativity lies in the heart of Seoul,"Speaking of creativity, Seoul Arts Center would be the hub of them all. Artistic architecture building from the outside is enough to lure us in to view the quiet & glamorous interiors. We were awe by the creative product display, paintings & sculptures. Even a florist shop was so beautiful in there. A place where you can fuel your mind with creativity at ease. (well that works for me, what about you?)", April 2014
96,5.0,Check it out!,"Great place to spend a few hours...or a day! You can Google the current exhibitions, but it's worth a visit anyway. Lovely outdoor area with food/drink stalls.

98,4.0,An enjoyable experience,"Took a train and then took an idyllic 10 min to the Seoul Arts Centre.  There is also a shuttle bus from the train station if you can wait for it.  Otherwise, it is very easy to find by foot.  The Center is well planned and all the various sections are easy to find; which is important.  We managed to catch a great exhibition here (Kusama Yayoi) and it was good fun.   We liked the place so much, we came back in the evening to watch a ballet.  Would definitely recommend it to friends.  Our only dissapointment was that the Calligraphy Museum was closed and the people could not inform us when it would be open.  Otherwise, it was a good and enjoyable experience.", June 2014
