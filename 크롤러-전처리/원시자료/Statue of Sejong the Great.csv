Ok so moving on, I needed the loo, to wash my face and to get out of the freaking cold, I saw an entrance with an elevator and I though, why not? I told my other companions to follow me. We took the elevator down and to my surprise, it was a free museum. I walked in and immediately I realized that this is my kind of place. Full of history and information on King Sejong and the Great general Yi Shun Shin. I was dumbfounded by the beauty of the place and best of all, it was underground. Amazing. Most of the reading panels are in English and you can even ask for an audio guide from the Information counter. Of course I did get my toilet break plus a 15 minutes nap on one of the benches but when I woke up. I suddenly realized this place was kinda familiar. Then I already knew that I had watched this place on TV before. And for those who didn't know, like my companions didnt, it was one of the shooting place for Running Man's episode 7 if I am not mistaken but with all the history around, who really care? Except me.. Overall, I am happy I stumbled upon this wonderful treasure whilst looking for a toilet.", October 2015

You can take a peaceful break along the Cheonggyecheon Stream, before following this to Dongdaemun Gate, or continuing down the plaza to Namdaemun Gate. We preferred the latter.King Sejong is considered by Koreans to be the greatest of all the Kings, and is honored with his image on the 10,000 Korean Won bill. He is credited with the creation of the Hangul alphabet that Koreans still use today. He is also responsible for reversing the anti-science sentiment created by Confucianism and elevating science to an important place in Korean society, a value still held by Korean culture today.This monument is imposing during the daytime, and quite beautiful at night.

TThe ruler introduced the current Korean handwriting. The museum is a tad too small but it's interactive and interesting. What I liked was the 4D short film on how Admiral Yishun's army defeated the enemies with only 133 battleships (1/3 of the enemies') through clever strategies and tactics and also the cannon ball shooting game. Not much souvenirs here. Purely for history buffs. It's within walking distance to the City Hall train station and there are many cafes along the way to quench your thirst.", August 2011
165,5.0,Don't miss the underground exhibit located directly under the statue!,"WoW! This exhibit is fantastic! Amazing no one has mentioned this before and it should be way up there on the list of things to see and do in Seoul. It should be in the top ten list! The statue hides the entrance to an underground exhibit of King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sunshin. This site is fairly new & it's free. The interactive exhibit and short programs are a delight for adults and children alike. Amazing how a fair and just king lived so long ago. The exhibit has 2 sections and a cafe the separates the two. In the Admiral Yi Sunshin area, there is a scale model of a turtle ship. This is sure to be a favorite among the naval history buffs, but anyone who enjoys history will enjoy the presentation. You should alot about 1 hour or so to see and experience it all. Schedule it before or right after lunch. It is close to cafes and the beginning of Cheonggyecheon (the river walk). I thoroghly enjoyed this exhibit, recommend it to everyone and wish it was larger.", October 2011
