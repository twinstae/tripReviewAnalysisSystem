0,4.0,Hanyangdoseong,Hanyangdoseong was built to safeguard Hanyang (Seoul) in Joseon dynasty. It was guarding the city for more than 500 years. Worth a visit., October 2019
1,4.0,Good Excursion for your Legs,Came here from Ihwa Mural Village on my way to Dongdaemun by foot. I was there almost towards the end of sunset and it was beautiful. Got a good exercise climbing up to one of the spot to take photos and it reminded me of the last scene of K-drama Memories of Alhambra~ :), September 2019
2,4.0,Excellent walk to see Seoul,Visited the Naksan to Dongdaemun section of the wall. The views were amazing and we were able to see a quieter side of Seoul. this section is an easy walk suitable for people of all ages., November 2019
3,3.0,it's a toss up,"because of the obsessively stubborn cultural korean way, you may regret going in this 'excursion' if having small children; once you start your walk on the perimeter, they won't let you out & also even check your passport at some point when going by the blue house (the korean white house)..", April 2019
4,5.0,really good,Did a fair bit of the walk and found it really good and as you walk higher up you get great views.  You will find nice little cafes and viewing points for great photos., October 2019
5,4.0,Nice to explore around,"Take the subway to Dongdaemun station and you will see the Southern Gate and the wall. It is part of the wall that surrounds the whole ancient city around Seoul. There are local stores and roadside peddlers selling local food and products. Stop by and try their local odeng (fishcake in clear soup), topokki (rice cakes in slightly spicy gravy), local sausages, which seems to be available everywhere. Nearby you can see the the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (like a structure from a Star Trek movie) and various shopping malls including duty free malls (without the tobacco and liquor).", November 2019
6,4.0,Steep hike to breathtaking views,"Attempted to reconnect with nature with a hike to Seoul city wall after a work trip, the path up was made easier with the cold of winter. Superb view of Seoul city from the TOP!", December 2019
7,5.0,A Highlight!,There are many sections of the city wall to follow. I chose the portion leading up Mt. Namsan to the N.Seoul Tower in Namsan Park. It was a section of about 500m beyond the cable car station and traversed a beautiful idyllic forest with the momiji autumn leaf colour change. An altogether peaceful setting. Viewing platforms allow better views of the city sections and former defenses., November 2019
8,4.0,"Not the Great Wall, but nice views of the city","Recommend going in the evening, as the city views are nice and the gate across the street is lit up nicely.", November 2019
9,5.0,Beautiful piece of old Seoul in the heart of an ultra modern city ,Right in the heart of Dongdaemun is this piece of of history that you must check out. It's a two minute climb up from near Heunginjimun gate. The view from up here is amazing. For the best experience go up before the sun sets and watch the lights of the city come on from up there., November 2019
10,5.0,Great outing!,"We spent a day walking one section of the Seoul City Wall.  Public transport to the Changuimum Gate was easy and straightforward and there were a couple of sweet little cafes near the gate, so we stopped for lunch and coffee.  Once we started walking, it was up, up, up to a point with lovely views of the city.  The only downside of this section was that it abuts a military base so photography was prohibited.  Overall, though, it was a sweet way to spend a few hours, taking in the sights and the beautiful autumn leaves!", October 2019
11,4.0,Picturesque,"Another must visit, allows for some cool photo souvenirs and is a real piece of the city’s vast history. I enjoyed my time there, though I wouldn’t spend hours. It’s close to Dongdaemun square, so can be combined with other activities...", November 2019
12,4.0,By the Dongdaemun shopping area check out the old city wall,"There is a section of Seoul's old city wall in the Dongdaemun area. It looks interesting and is good for a photo (or several), you can walk beside it and in places climb along the wall rampart however its not really safe or set up for it. Other walls say at Suwon can be safely walked.  It's worth a look if you are in the area.", October 2019
13,5.0,Part of history,Take a leisurely stroll along the wall to feel the spirit of the old days. Above is a nice view of the city., September 2019
14,5.0,Beautiful sunsets,"I hiking up to the top right as the sun was setting and it was breathtaking. Beautiful nature all around you, birds chirping, wind blowing, then as the sunsets, you see the city lights of Seoul over take the scenery.", July 2019
15,4.0,The East Gate wall is one of the best,, September 2019
16,5.0,Must do if in the area.,, September 2019
17,2.0,A bit disappointing,"We followed the city wall whilst hiking up Inwangson mountain...the viewpoint at the top's great, but in all honesty, the city wall in Seoul looks like it was constructed just last month. The city wall in nearby Suwon is much more impressive.", September 2019
18,5.0,Portions all around the city,, September 2019
19,4.0,All around seoul,We could actually see the old seoul walls in many places. Its interesting to see the old city walls. Near namsan park we could see a long part of it., September 2019
20,3.0,Spectular at Night,"Go at night - great illumination.  Other than that, it is a reconstructed section of the old wall - without a gate.  It will take all of 15 minutes", August 2019
21,4.0,Unexpected ,, August 2019
22,4.0,Extensive,"About 12km of the original 18km still exists at various locations around the city. For a good walk by the walls Namsan Hill and Bukaksan Hill are good choices. Don't expect the Great Wall of China, they are quite low wall when walked inside.", July 2019
23,3.0,Many places to see the Seoul City Wall,You can see parts of the wall in different spots around the city. My favorite place is in Namsan Park., August 2019

25,3.0,A day visit,, June 2019
26,5.0,Goes together well with mural village,"A relatively easy hike from mural village down to DongDaeMun.  Can enjoy seoul scenery from high above and see Namsan Towel from far away.  At the top, near Naksan Park, you can get a panoramic view of Seoul.  Very spectacular.  There are a lot of history behind these walls, and the are also signs that explain the wall changes and dynasty changes, people who enjoy a little bit of history and hiking would love this spot.", April 2019
27,5.0,Steep climb but worth it,"Discovered the climb up to Naksan Park following the Seoul City Wall almost be accident.  Path starts just North of Dongdaemun Gate.  Walked up on the inside of the Wall (which provides the best views out over the city), then back down on the outside of the Wall (some good photo opportunities of the wall itself).  Take water (especially in Summer), a hat, good footwear and a camera.  Plenty of places to stop on the way up to Naksan Park (the track doubles as a fitness circuit, and there is plenty of shaded seating).  Path varies between paved and unpaved on the way up.  Not really suitable for small children.", July 2019
28,5.0,Nice photo opp and parks,, November 2018
29,3.0,Stumble upon Seoul City Wall!!!,"I was walking around Dongdaemun when I campe upon the city wall!! It was just right off Dongdaemun station, exit 1 I think. It was nice, so much history. Come here for a relaxing time and just cool off....so nice in the evening, and it was good to see.", May 2019
30,5.0,A steep hike but great view,Walking up from Naksan park then down towards DDP is definitely the preferred route. Pleasant uphill but would have been more difficult the other way round due to the terrain. Decided to skip the mural village considering the residents prefer it that way., April 2019

38,5.0,Excellent views and lots of opportunities for unique experiences,Make sure you plan ahead of time - the wall is verrrrrry long! The entire wall would take an entire day to walk but it's conveniently broken into zones and the website has a dowloadable map. It's very accessible in certain parts of the city and there are many spots (like Naksan Park) that provide amazing views of the city. May other tourist attractions are easily accessible while you walk the wall., December 2018

43,5.0,Memorable Hike,"Hiking along the Seoul Wall was a highlight of our trip.  We walked from Hyehwamun Gate through Waryong Park to Malbawi Information Center.  We enjoyed the fall colors, panoramic views and varied terrain.  Some sections were challenging with the uphill climb, but it was worth it.  Our goal is to hike the whole wall one day.", November 2018
44,5.0,Seoul hidden gem,, November 2018
45,4.0,History meets big city,"We walked along a section of the city wall in Namsan park, from the top of Namsan down to Myeongdong. The wall is beautiful and interesting, it's inspiring to see the effort that has gone into preservation and reconstruction. Would love to go back to Seoul, see more of the city wall and visit the related museum.", October 2018
46,5.0,A full day's hike around the city,"I finally accomplished my goal to follow the entire city wall trail in one day. If you do this, start early and bring plenty of water and snacks because there are not many places to get drinking water, especially on the northern and toughest part of the circle. Check the schedule, you can only visit the northern section during the daytime and not on Mondays. Check the excellent website for details about the hike. It took me about 12 hours with a few short rest breaks. I did the northern section first since it is the toughest one. You get great views of the city from different angles.", August 2018

50,5.0,Take a hike along city wall and get views over neighbourhoods,"Construction of the stone city wall (Hanyangdoseong) began in 1394, designed to protect the city, much of the wall was built on the ridges of the surrounding mountains, when complete the wall measured 18627 metres long, varying in height from five to eight metres. Today there is only 13370 metres of the wall remaining and a good place for acity hike.  On our first visit to Seoul we did not have the opportunity or know to hike along the City Walls, on our recent return visit to Seoul we made a point of finding an easy accessed section of the wall, this was from Dongdaemun.  Across the road from Heunginjimun Gate is a uphill path to the wall, this path takes you to the City Wall Museum, which was great to visit, and all the way up to Naksan Park where there are views over neighbourhoods.  It is then possible walk further north.  There are other sections of the wall that can be discovered like over near Dongnimmun/ Seodaemun Prison History hall.  Wear comfortable shoes, take water, snacks and sunscreen and have fun.", April 2018
51,4.0,City Wall and City Wall Museum,"The City Wall of Seoul has a fascinating story. If you are hiker, you can hike along this wall for most of the way, yet some parts are off limit. A museum was dedicated to this wall and it walks you through the centuries. Dongdeamun subway stop takes you to a part of the wall and its museum.", October 2017

56,4.0,Seoul City Wall walk,, March 2018
57,5.0,Great adventure and fun,"This place is amazing. Would recommend it to anyone going to Seoul to stop by and take a hike around the fortress. To get to the wall, we decide to walk through the old village instead of taking the bus.", January 2018
58,5.0,Excellent hike on a nice day,"Started at Dongdaemun Gate, you will see the start of the trail across from the Gate. It is well paved and you just follow the wall. It is a hike uphill so wear comfortable shoes. Not too far, you will reach Ihwa Mural Village which will provide plenty of photo opportunities as there are many murals all over the houses in this small village. So if you are only planning to do section of the wall, starting at the Dongdaemun Gate will be good so at least you can see the Ihwa Mural Village along the way.", November 2017
59,4.0,Great view over looking the city from above,"Bring your sneakers because you want to take a long wall to the top. Along the wall you see some of houses still constructed back in the area of times. When you get the top you can see the amazing view of the city. It is worth seeing. This place is free. If you don't want to walk all the way, take a left turn into the path, walk downhill and see the local community. Some of old folks are in amazing shape. They walk up and down the steep hill to get to where they are going. There is a Seoul City Museum that is near by.  Go see it first.", November 2017

63,5.0,Fantastic for walking and great views,, September 2017
64,5.0,Hike up from the East Gate,"When you are at the East Gate, follow the wall up into the mountain nearby and just keep going.  You will be rewarded with a nice steep hike, great views, a quiet neighborhood and ultimately some great lookouts over the city.  Keep going to the lookouts, which are a bit up there.  From the first lookout, descend into the neighborhood via funky shops, stairs and even a hairpin turn in the road - a great and interesting descent!", August 2017
65,2.0,Historic but nothing special,, August 2017
66,5.0,Can be seen nicely from Namsan Park,This is not a wall to be compared to the Great Wall of China.  However you will be able to take some nice pictures at the top of the wall from Namsan Park.  The wall winds itself down from the top of the park.  Following the wall up or down is not for the feint hearted so put your trainers on!, June 2017
67,5.0,Beautiful views!,"I really enjoyed walking along the city wall. It's got great views of nature and the city. I did an evening walk, so it was bright out when I started and when I was done, it was dark out. But no worries, the city wall lights up at night with plenty of lamps to brighten the path and you get a different view in the dark. Along the wall is plenty of nature as well, as it is next to a few parks. It does go up and down, so you get a pretty good workout from walking along the wall. There are plenty of areas to rest and take photos. This is a must visit attraction if you are visiting Seoul and want some exercise while taking in gorgeous views!", May 2017
68,4.0,Serious Hike - Lots of Stairs & Great Views,"Hiking the entire loop is a major undertaking, but well worth it on a beautiful day. The hike will allow you to see other areas of Seoul and even some local neighborhoods. You can also hike partial sections. You will need your passport to go through the Military area & no photos allowed there.", April 2017
69,3.0,Short hike in the middle of the city,A short walk from Dongdaemun Plaza. You'll find a gate which leads to a part of the now preserved parts of the city wall that once surrounded the city from the envaders. It's best viewed at night without any entrance fee. Good for viewing the busy street below., March 2017
70,5.0,Great experience,, February 2017
71,5.0,Lots of small sections or the whole wall,"There is a pathway that can be followed around the entire wall. Get a map before you start as it has access points and approx walking times. Takes 12 hours to do in one hit but easy to do in sections over several days. The section up to Seoul Tower is very popular and can get busy. The top section over the mountains has opening times (winter 10-3, summer 9-4, closed Mondays).", January 2017
72,4.0,Hike,Was looking for N Seoul Tower but came across this place with steep walk up. Was panting when I reached the top. Suddenly it dawn upon me the long stretch of wall was something ancient. Great view of Seoul at the top, December 2016

75,5.0,Best thing to do in Seoul. Wonderful urban hike!,, December 2016
76,4.0,Fantastic hike,"Convenient location for a mountain and forest hike. You can get on the trail from lots of different locations and the trail runs in a circle. Beware most of the monuments on the trail are closed on Mondays, so you can still hike the trail but not visit any of the gates.", November 2016
77,4.0,Great walk but don't forget about the humidity,"I love walking so I really got much pleasure from this few hours slow pace walk. You get very nice views of Seoul and, thanks God, there are several places to have a rest during the trail. But you should be in a good shape - it's more like hiking in mountains than just walking in the city. And take water - it was my mistake, I forgot to take it - so I had some tough moments - climate in Seoul is very humid for me, so I felt not good. Choose comfy clothes and sport shoes, and don't forget your camera. The views are really amazing, especially from the park.", September 2016
78,4.0,Great walk but only for people in good shape,"This is a 18km long walk with some parts which are very steep. You will be able to walk on the trail along the fortress wall, to get a panoramic view of Seoul at some times and even (if you have your password with you) enter in a restrictive zone with guards, cameras and motion detectors (Blue House security).", September 2016
79,5.0,Let's take awalk,"First of all, let me tell you that I love walking, for real. So when I found out about Seoul city wall, i was so excited. Although I did not take the full route of walk, only partly from the Namsan park, but I was so happy. From the distance, you can see the view of Seoul. But, take a note, I would not recommend this for older traveler or ones who travel with kids.", July 2016
80,5.0,Great Sunday walk,"The trail is amazing to walk on - it is quiet and really beautiful. You get great views of Seoul . I started from Heunginjimun Gate and walked until Hyehwamun Gate. Right now, in July 2016, the Seoul Wall Museum is closed!!! Although many sites suggest you start from there, right now you can't.", July 2016
81,5.0,Baegak Mountain Trail was awesome,"I did the Baegak Mountain Trail which was one of the more challenging parts of the City Wall hike. As this part is heavily guarded by the military, u will need your passport to be issued a tag. Do not take photographs of any security cameras of picture facing the direction of the city as they are ""military secrets""! The hike and and views were awesome. Start at Changuimun gate and exit Waryong Park for a hike of abt 3.5-4km. Bring loads of water to hydrate in this summer heat!", July 2016
82,5.0,Seoul city wall,"Did only the part along the Namsan park and the little one around dongdaemun, would like to return some day and try to follow the recommended routes on the Korean tourism website! It's of a much better scale than the one in suwon so do prepare for 1-2 days!", March 2016
83,4.0,Relaxing Hike Along a Fortress Wall,, October 2015
84,5.0,Steep Walk up the hill to Namsan follow the wall,I didn't know about the city wall until I was walking up to Namsan Park and it was just there in front of me! It is a great structure and when you get to the top of the park you can see the wall all the way down into Seoul.  The wall can be seen from the top of the park and the Seoul Namsan Tower so no need to  make a special visit.  Just go about your daily tourist trips and you will no doubt see it along the way., March 2016
85,4.0,free long hikes,"The city wall is not very well organized in some sections.  Missing all together in others.  Easy to get lost in...  But some sections are well done and rebuild, especially when combined with local parks.  Anyways, it is very challenging to do the entire wall in a day.  To get started, the Namsan (south) section is medium difficult but well developed.  The Naksan section is shorter on the east side.  But for a challenge, do the North and North West sections that climbs through two large peaks, 340 m high each.  Be ware that the north section is a fully active military zone and you need to have your passport to get it.  It is not very pleasant to be watched by solders throughout your hike.", June 2015
