0,4.0,Lovely Environment,"I felt that this is a good way to enjoy  and observe how the local spends their weekend. I was there on Saturday night - very lovely atmosphere - good flea market of handmade stuff, tattooist, good food and beautiful light show by the bridge.   Nice place to go for a picnic", September 2019
1,5.0,Enjoyed a colorful night beside the river .,"A quite beautiful and colorful fountain display from the ""Banpo Bridge"". You can enjoy the display after every half an hour from evening till 9:00 pm. Great place for refreshments and fresh air.", October 2019
2,5.0,Different kind of light show,"Quite a distance walking from express bus terminal metro station, anyway it is worth it watching the light shower where water jets coming out from side of the bridge. The timing of shows are 7.30pm, 8pm, 8.30pm, 9pm. Each show lasts around 20mins. There are some food stalls nearby where you can get a quick snack. Restaurants and cafes are also available.", October 2019
3,3.0,Better seen from the hanging cafe on the Dongjak bridge,"If you want to get a better view of the entire Banpo bridge go to the hanging cafe on the Dongjak bridge, you will see steams of colored water. If you want to see it up close, take the #9 line and exit at the express bus terminal, follow the signs and you will walk about 20 minutes along Banpo-daero until you find the entrance to go under the bridge, follow the signs that say floating island and walk another 10 minutes to Banpo Hangang Park. Make sure to check for schedule of shows. When we went there there were only 3 20 minute shows starting at 8 pm every 1/2 hour. From here you can walk to the man-made floating islands to watch the colorless steams of water and the bright colored lights underneath. I recommend 1 to 2 hours mostly because it takes time to get there.", October 2019
4,5.0,Great on an evening ,"I loved this area! Went on a Friday night, watched the show which was very relaxing! Then walked over through all the other buildings, and a night market with food trucks! I think its worth seeing, and ita free!", September 2019
5,3.0,Light show ,"Nice parc, perfect for strolls. At night, the bridge has a light show. It just misses music but it’s a nice show. It’s best to see it when it is really dark.", May 2019
6,3.0,Light show ,The light show was quite average and certainly not worth the 30 minute bus journey we took to get there. It was not really a ‘show’ but just coloured lights on the side of the bridge.Definitely worth going to if you’re in walking distance but not worth going to if you have a longer journey., August 2019
7,5.0,Good vibes,"Good times don’t need to be expensive. Come here for a night out. Bring a friend along. Sit down on the stairs, or bring a blanket. Grab some snacks and drinks from the local food truck. Enjoy the colorful water fountain show. Afterwards, walk to the floating islands. Take in the summer air, the colorful lights. Enjoy yourself. Time spent here is quite magical.", August 2019
8,3.0,not that  spectacular,"I went there with high expectations and was a bit disappointed. It wasn't as colorful as i imagined, it was just a really long water fountain.The park near it was nice to hang out at night though. Lots of food stalls are open and there are live performances too.", June 2019
9,3.0,More spectacle than spectacular . . .,. . . is how one tour guide accurately describes this attraction. We walked from the JW Marriott Seoul and were less than impressed -- but the Banpo Hangang Park is lovely for sitting out on a cool Seoul evening., May 2019
10,4.0,A great picnic place!,"It's great for picnic on Spring or Fall. You can enjoy the fountain also at night, but it's only beautiful after the sunset. Luckily there was a firework when I visited the bridge, so it's mire beautiful.", May 2019
11,2.0,Disappointing,"The descriptions make it seem like a place you really want to go, but I was disappointed when I saw the 'show'. They play music and the fountain moves up and down a bit and does a wave pattern and that's pretty much it. You can barely see the coloured lights. I loved the buildings on the other side of the road, though. They change colours too and look beautiful.", May 2019
12,4.0,Amazing,Lots of people visit here in the evening for light show. There are a lot of food trucks and mobile shop here. You better prepare mat to sit on the floor while the show in on., May 2019
13,3.0,Okay lah,"Its something new, fountain bridge but not colourful enough if you want to take pictures with it. They played songs when the fountain comes on which lasted 20 mins or more. We left after that cos theres nothing much to do after you have pictures taken unless you want to enjoy the cold wind.", April 2019
14,3.0,Not so exciting visit,"Went there as it supposed to be a rainbow fountain festival only to find out that it only happens on Friday and Saturday nights when we reached the place.Without this feature, the visit was only so so and probably not worth the hassle going there.  There were some nice lighting (but not a big area) to take some pictures.", April 2019
15,4.0,Fountain show in banpo bridge,Arrive at Express Bus terminal subway station you have to walk around 10minute to the banpo bridgeThe flower is full blooming along the walk path to banpo hangang parkAt the park still no blooming treeThe weather is still cold on 3april2019 4 celcius degreeOn wednesday 3april2019Rainbow Fountain show on banpo bridge was starting on 7.30pmShowing dancing water with 5 songsEnjoy it.. it so beautiful night, April 2019
16,5.0,Nice location for evening,"An interesting bridge that attracts photographers, families and couples in love. You can watch the fountain show from a special area on the river bank, from the bridge, or by choosing a river boat trip.", August 2018
17,5.0,Banpo Hangang Park,This is a fantastic way to end your night in Seoul while looking along the Han River and enjoying the water light show! The show is every night for 20 mins on the right side of the bridge. There are shops nearby to grab some snacks while waiting for the show. Be sure to arrive at least 5 mins early for good seats on the weekdays and at least 30 mins on the weekends. You can get here by getting off at the Express bus Terminal Station and walking less than a mile down to the park., October 2018
18,4.0,Enjoyable night fountain show,"If you have time, it is worth enjoying the fountain show. It is very beautiful and there are a few different times it shows. It is easy to reach here by metro.", August 2018
19,1.0,Upset,"Stayed one whole day in the area just to wait till the evening to catch a glimpse of the Banpo Rainbow fountain. Ended up 5 mins past 7. 30pm, they announced show cancel due to heavy rain but the whole day did not even rain at all.", September 2018
20,3.0,Just OK,"We travelled a fair distance to get to Banpo bridge expecting to see a water and lights spectacular. It was just OK - not worth travelling over an hour just to see this. If you have seen spectacular lights on water in Dubai, Vegas or Singapore, you'll be disappointed with this. That said, there is a great walking area and outdoor park near the bridge. The other thing to bear in mind is that this is a night only show so don't turn up during the day.", August 2018
21,4.0,The Bridge. The fountain ,"Beautiful and smelly, colorful and crowded place. However, I am in love with this landmark of Seoul!Definitely this place is very romantic. What’s interesting that this place doesn’t have asian style :)I would visit this place again and again.", June 2018
22,4.0,Water show,"There’s music, there’s lights, there’s fountain shooting moving water, there’s fireworks. There are a lot people armed with sitting mats gathering here. This is a great spot to watch the sunset and picnic.", June 2018
23,4.0,Colorful and pretty,"I was just there on Saturday evening and truly enjoyed the light fountain show. We were lucky to see also the fireworks by the bridge. Even though it was raining on Saturday evening, the rain and muggy weather added to the charm of the colorful fountain show. Would recommend it to others", June 2018
24,2.0,Disappointing! Light show did not proceed as scheduled,"According to the official Korea tourism website it said that there will be light show on weekdays during this season, my friend and i arrived and waiting for the show to start at 8&8:30pm but it did not happen at all. Felt it was a waste of our time and effort to come all the way here though there are other nice views around as well.", May 2018
25,5.0,Banpo bridge rainbow fountain,"Banpo bridge has 38 water pumps and 380 nozzles that could draw as much as 190 tons of water per minute from the Han river. The Rainbow Fountain operate between april and june and also between september and october every year. The show of water, lights, and music is very nice and has a duration of 20 minutes, running 4 to 6 times a day. If you are near the bridge at 8pm, 8.30pm, or 9pm, you can witness the show.", April 2018
26,3.0,Not a must do,We went with high expectations which was probably not the best idea. A light show is probably not the best description of this event. However it was a bucket list thing almost considering the guiness book and world's longest fountain fact so in that regard we were happy.If you're coming from the main city area or anywhere that is not close to the bridge we recommend that you spend the evening there. It's a great atmosphere by the park area with heaps of food options and little craft vendors and music. It's a great way to relax eat some street food and watch the fountain. If you're coming by bus then be warned as it took us 40 mins for an 8minute journey so plan ahead and make sure you leave some back up time if you're unable to make the show at your preferred time.Either way it was nice for us to see something that's made it's in records., May 2018
27,4.0,Nice sunset walk,"We walked across this bridge at sunset and were the only two pedestrians there. It was nice having the bridge to ourselves and the view from there was really pretty. We really enjoyed the walk. Next to Banpo Bridge there were floating islands which were used in the filming of The Avengers: Age of Ultron. We admired the islands from a distance but didn't go in for a closer look. Apparently the park near the floating islands is a good time to watch the rainbow bridge light up at night, but now was not the time of year when the light show is on unfortunately.", March 2018
28,5.0,Definitely worth a visit on a Saturday night,"I went to the south side of the bridge, by Banpo Hanggang Park, so I am not sure what the north side has.  On the Southeast side, there was a night market with food trucks and small vendors.  On the Southwest side you have “Some Sevit”(aka Sebitseom) and a lot of seating area.  There were plenty of food trucks.  Options included, fried chicken, steak, skewers, fries, pork belly, shrimp... I can’t recall if there were any desserts... my mind was centered on the fried chicken. 88chicken(??) had a truck there.  There seemed to be a never ending line, meaning it the line never went away.  The price was really fair for what you get. Though it was nice and crispy, there were some pieces that where the meat was really dry but a majority were the right texture and moisture level.  The vendors were your typical vendor that you see all over Seoul.  There was one performer while I was there but i did stop to watch as I actually didn’t even see where they were,  there was an area where it was dark where people could sit down so I think the performer was there...In front of Sebitseom, there are several areas that you can sit. There is an amphitheater-like area, which would have made a great stage for busking, but was completely underutilized.  There was an area with a some kind of structure that people used as benches, along with benches all over the park.  There was a nice open area that people used to do a little skateboarding.  Sebitseom has beautiful lit buildings with a nice backdrop.  It is nice to visit during sunset as the sun sets behind the three buildings. There was a beer garden and a convenience store with some tables setup outside to get a nice view of the rivier and Seoul(north of the river).  There are also some restaurants and a CNN cafe if you need something more.", April 2018
29,4.0,Nice light-show at night,"It takes some efforts to get to the park to watch the evening light-shows. From the Express Bus Terminal Station (Metro lines 3, 7 or 9), you walk out of Exit 8-1 and then straight for several minutes. At the junction (with Reborn City building seen on the left) you turn right, continuing for another 10 minutes or so towards the riverside. In the middle of the walk, you cross the road and enter a walk-tunnel which brings you to the riverside park for watching the light-show. Please research on internet for the show schedules. Each show lasts for about 20 minutes. Best to go there when the wind is not too strong as the water sprays get blown left and right by the wind ie not forming a uniform pattern.", April 2018
30,5.0,Not expect it,I had a good time actually in this place because when i visited here there's a small concert in their area with urban zakapa there ! There's also some food bazaar and the bridge is so beautiful in the night, May 2017
31,5.0,Longest Bridge Fountain in the World,"It's a 10 minute walk from Express Bus Terminal train station. Make sure you have a pocket Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi. Just in case you get lost--google map it. I got lost on my first try taking the bus from itaewon last year (for me, buses in Seoul is hard to figure out). This year I took the train. So much better. I stopped by a cafe in one of the modern buildings beside the bridge. The light show was cute. It was not spectacular, but it was good. April-June, September-October]Weekdays: 12:00, 20:00, 20:30, 21:00 Weekends: 12:00, 19:30, 20:00, 20:30, 21:00 [July-August]Weekdays: 12:00, 19:30, 20:00, 20:30, 21:00 Weekends: 12:00, 19:30, 20:00, 20:30, 21:00, 21:30 * Show duration: 20min* Operating hours are subject to change due to weather conditions or internal affairs. Next time I visit, I'll try the snack bars/convenient stores by the river.", April 2017
32,2.0,Not much to see here,"I took the bus over to Banpo Park to see the ""rainbow bridge"".  I like musical water displays so I definitely wanted to visit.  Unfortunately, it seemed like one side of the bridge was broken, then once it started it was rather disappointing.  The water sprayed out and each nozzle seems to be controllable to move up and down and change colors.  However, the colors don't really affect the water stream so they all look the same and you can barely see it.  The movements didn't seem to go with the music very well either.  The photos I saw online looked much better so maybe it was broken.", October 2017
33,3.0,Date Spot,"If you are simply traveling through Seoul, this attraction may be somewhat of a disappointment but for locals or those truly interested in experience life in Seoul, the Banpo Bridge Rainbow Fountain (반포대교 달빛무지개분수) is a great spot for a date night or time out with friends/family. It is quite far of a walk from the subway station so you may want to take a taxi to get here. I came at night with some friends and was surprised by the lively festival-like vibe that I got. There were market vendors, food trucks, and live music adding to the Rainbow Fountain Show off of the bridge.", September 2017
34,2.0,Disappointed,"After seeing photos of the Banpodaegyo, named the rainbow fountain, I decided to come here. There were quite a number of people sitting along the river waiting for the fountains so we joined them as well. I was so disappointed when it started because it was basically a fountain with white lights and music and the back. Don't come here if you are expecting a rainbow fountain, it's nothing like that. The night was saved by fried chicken delivery... hahaha", May 2017
35,1.0,don't waste your time,"It doesn't worth seeing. Luckily it was just a part of the river cruise, cause it would make me sad if I went only to see the bridge from the promenade. It doesn't look like a rainbow at all.", August 2017
36,5.0,Gorgeous night market,"I went there because it was rated No.1 night market of Seoul. The left side of the bridge is a large exiabition hall well known for its colourful rainbow lighting. The right side is the night market that providing delicous snacks and street food. Meanwhile, you can also seeking for some hand-made accessories such as ear rings and brackets. It is full of youngs and visitors. For me, it's the best night stroll during my stay in Seoul.", May 2017
37,1.0,Hundreds waited for nothing,"Lots of people sitting and waiting in the warm evening for... absolutely nothing. A muffled tannoy announcement that was too quiet for anyone to hear must have been saying that it had been cancelled (for seemingly no reason) but as no one could hear it everyone just sat and waited. Eventually, after over an hour, we gave up. Looks like a pipe with holes in it stuck on the side of a concrete bridge... give it a miss.", July 2017
38,4.0,Fun area apart from the bridge lights and fountain show,"We walked over at night from Garosu-gil, and arrived after the light/fountain show (8pm) but in time to hang out near the bridge where there are at least thirty food trucks and vendors selling knick-knacks on the east side of the bridge until about midnight. The west side of the bridge features a few buildings built out into the water with restaurants as well as an electric-powered boat attraction that we did (not listed separately on tripadvisor) that was an enjoyable 30 minutes. Nice ambience, good place to picnic and to see locals hanging out.", June 2017
39,2.0,not worth your time,It's near Hangang Park. It's a place where youngsters go and chill out after work/ school. The musical fountain itself was a letdown. You could not see the lights at all and it was just streams/ jets of water with music. I stayed from the first show (8pm) till 9pm and I decided not to waste my time trying to see if the third show would be better.Shows are 20 minutes long., June 2017
40,2.0,Very disappointing!,"Came to see the water show especially for our last night in seoul. From the pics it looked really special and colorful, but its not like that in person, youll just see water with a little bit of light and music on the background. Nothing special.", June 2017
41,3.0,Nice for hangout,"The riverside park was nice for picnic & hangout, also good place to watch sunset.There was a 'night market' when I went there. I think it's in conjunction with festival. a lot of food truck with various type of food. The water show somehow not as great as I expected but still enjoyable.", April 2017
42,3.0,Not enough lights on the fountain,"The fountain and light show was a bit of a disappointment. There is far too much ambient white lights from the bridge that the coloured lights on the water hardly show up. To get any sort of a half good photo you need a tripod and long duration photo. Luckily there was a night market on so lots of stalls and places to eat and even some singers. Would have been a bit of a wasted journey had it not been for that. How to get there. Train to ""Express Bus Terminal Station"" then leave on exit 8. Follow the road to the junction with the overhead road and turn right. As you reach the pedestrian lights, cross the road and follow the path down to the water. About 15 mins walk but no stairs once you leave the station.", June 2017
43,4.0,Short picnic in the night,"What I love in Seoul in the night is right there, I enjoyed my night time with my friends, we gathered and had some talks.. kinda night picnic. There were a lot of people there.. we can see beautiful water fountain every night.. when I went there, I ordered some chicken and cola to make up my good times there. I ordered by phone and its very close to public transportation.. the place is very wide to take some site.. its kinda picnic :)", May 2017
44,4.0,Average show but amazing ambience,"We had a bit of trouble finding the bridge as a highway is right beside the coast and we couldn't find the way to cross the highway. Luckily we managed to find a local who could speak good english and he directed us to the bridge.When we arrived, we thought we were at the wrong bridge because it looked like a normal bridge that couldn't conduct a water show. We were on our way to the other, more lit-up and colourful bridge when the music suddenly played and we realised that we were at the right place. There was a group of people ballroom dancing while the people sitting on the steps watched. The atmosphere of the place was chill and great, but the water show average as water was just pouring from the bridge off-sync from the music that was playing. The water bank was also very dark due to the lack of street lamps.", May 2017
45,3.0,Not as Expected,"We visited in Oct 2015.  To arrive at this destination was really a challenge.  We took the transport information (by subway) from the Visit Korea website and we ended at middle of no where.  After asking for direction from a few strangers, we still could not figure out how to get there.  Communication was an issue.  Eventually, a Good Samaritan walked us all the way to Hangang Park which is quite close to Banpo Bridge  She was a lady whom we asked for direction earlier.  She tried very hard to explain us the direction in Korean but we still could not get it.  After we continued with our journey for quite some time, she caught up with us and walked us all the way to the park.  We also met another 2 tourists who had also been walking and asking for direction all night searching for the same thing. The fountain was a disappointment.  It is nothing close to those pictures shown in the website.  The colours did not stand out and it was more like a monotone fountain.  Perhaps, we were not watching from the correct angle.  You can give this a miss unless you happen to be near by or time is on your side.  Having said that, walking all night was a good exercise.I just rechecked the transportation from the Visit Korea webpage.  The direction from Dongjak Station, Seoul Subway Line 4, is removed.  There’s also a slight revision with the direction by bus as well.  However, it’ll be good to verify with any Korean Tourist Organization you can contact, ask the locals or the transportation hubs when you’re in Korea.", October 2016
46,5.0,Enjoy the romance vibe,"If you have no plan in the night and you still have more energy, i suggest you to visit this place. Theres a rainbow water fountain with the korean songs as a backsound. So many couple here, bcs the view really pretty. So any of you can enjoy the korean songs with a beautiful view. This place surrounded by citylight from the building around the bridge. And it was awesome", May 2017
47,2.0,Under-whelming!,"Was hoping the colours would be more spectacular but was disappointed. If you want a picnic on the river bank, come and enjoy, otherwise go shopping in the underground shopping area nearby instead.", May 2017
48,2.0,Don't waste your time ,"It's their daily show last around 10 min , nothing fantastic . Except the sunset on the other site packed with locals with tent ⛺️.", May 2017
49,4.0,Nice area for picnic ,Banpo bridge or rainbow bridge illuminates the night and it is something unique for a water feature. It is nicer seeing from afar. A great park for cycling and picnic., April 2017
50,2.0,NO WATER SHOW TODAY!!!,"We dedicated our evening to make a long trip during cold evening to see the remarkable water and light show from the bridge faced with the fact theres no show for today! Based on the information from local cafe staff within the area. They will resume the warerfall and light show on April. But no clear information of what date they will resume the show!!!However the location is still a charming place to spend your evening. You can see the bridge, river and charming pier with few cafe and restaurant there.One major drawback will be the remote location of this place. You must use bus or taxi to come here. And only few cafe and restaurant here. No shopping place", March 2017
51,3.0,A place to gather your friend/love on with Fried Chicken and Beer,"The show or picture is not what you seen in google.  You know why? Because you are using your phone to capture it. However, i do manage to take some nice shots with my phone. First, you have to manually setup your camera setting. Lower the ISO and make the shutter time longer. Then it will have nice image on it.Instead of bring jacket for yourself. Hug the one who beside you( your friend or your lover ) while having beer and fried chicken( Korean delicacy) Dont you think it is a special moment while watching the rainbow waterfall?", October 2016
52,2.0,Not too fond of it,"Nearer to Express Bus Terminal station compared to Donjak station. A relaxing place to unwind. Due to the rain (well, it's actually drizzle), they planned to cancel the show but the show was up ten minutes after the announcement. Only one side of the bridge had the water fountain with display lights and out of tune music. Not that entertaining but good initiatives though to build up the water fountains on a bridge.", October 2016
53,5.0,Banpo,Beautiful view any time of day but especially at night. Is very close to the Express Bus Terminal. Worth a visit., April 2016
54,2.0,eh...,"I've seen the fountain show a couple of times and it just never lives up to anything resembling entertaining, inspiring, or majestic. It's just some water spouts and colored lights with crap orchestral music straining through the mist.", July 2016
55,3.0,Rainbow Bridge,Just come in the right time and u will look the bridge show. Its so windy and little bit cold bring ur couple here, September 2015
56,4.0,Good to sit by the river and watch,"Its free, its a good location (right by the riverside), get a chilled beer and spend time - whats not to like about it. Tips: best seen when its dark (8 or even later), buy chilled beer from the convenience store around the park area, if coming by bus/taxi avoid weekends (road gets badly jammed on weekends, best to take a train and walk). Avoid the bbq chicken and order a pizza instead, by far the worst chicken I have had in Korea)", July 2016
57,1.0,Nothing spectacular,"Went on a weeknight and it wasn't as spectacular and as colorful as the photos on google. I wouldn't recommend coming here only for the purpose of seeing the fountain show, but if you happen to be in the area, might as well make a stop to see the show.", July 2016
58,4.0,Nice part of Han river. ,Interesting rainbow moonlight show but only one side of the bridge because it was a weeknight.  The area next to banpo was nice to walk with  illuminated buildings. It's called Sebit floating islands. There are some shops and  coffee place inside., June 2016
59,3.0,Enjoyable Evening,"This was an enjoyable evening in a park along the river.  They pipe music through speakers, the water undulates through colored lights.  For me it was okay but I'm comparing them to the Fountains at the Bellagio in Vegas and Niagara Falls.  My niece had seen neither and really loved the display. Our evening was cut short by rain so be aware of the weather.  Most people brought blankets, picnic baskets and wine.  So go prepared for a quiet evening of companionship.", June 2016
60,5.0,Favorite place in Seoul,"This is my favorite place in Seoul. I visited this place twice, because the first one i couldn't see the rainbow fountain. Its is located next to Some Sevit/Floating Island/ Some Sevit is on the left side and the rainbow fountain is on the right side of the bridge.Rainbow fountain will start around 8PM and the last will be around 9.30PM.  This place is crowded with young people. Here you can just sit, watch the crowd, taking photos, cycling, etc. For me, sitting while chit chat-ing with my friends is one of the best thing i did. We brought snacks and beer cans too. After a long walk around Seoul, this place is best to relax and enjoy the night view of Seoul.", May 2016
61,3.0,Nice display but not spectacular,"Having read about the rainbow display on Banpo Bridge before travelling and seeing pictures, I was expecting something truly mesmerizing.While our view of this from the Han River sunset cruise was a nice display, it did not have the ""wow"" factor that I was hoping for. Still worth a visit.", May 2016
62,4.0,Order chicken and then watch the free lights show!,"The light show itself was pretty, with different colors, music, and spurts of water from the side of the bridge. My friends and I ordered food from the many delivery guys waiting around the area and ate it at the stairs (viewing area). I think most of the locals do this. Expect to see a lot of couples! Bring a jacket because it might get chilly at night while waiting for the show. The bridge is near Floating Island, a filming location for Avengers 2. While waiting for the light show, you might want to check it out. It's at the left side of the bridge! :)From Dongjak station exit 1 or 2, you will have to walk a lot before reaching Banpo bridge. Getting off at the Express Bus Terminal station might be nearer and more convenient.", June 2015
63,1.0,Just NO,"I was being hosted with my friend and she swore it was beautiful and colorful when she first saw it a year before. Maybe it gets better in peak season, but honestly it was very underwhelming and not worth the metro fare to get there in my opinion. Yes the water flows very nicely from the bridge but there is no color and it does not look like it does on Google. Maybe if seen from above?   Also the music wasn't even loud enough to hear.", April 2016
64,3.0,Rainbow over the bridge,"The Moonlight Rainbow Fountain is the world's longest bridge fountain[6] that set a Guinness World Record with nearly 10,000 LED nozzles that run along both sides that is 1,140m long, shooting out 190 tons of water per minute. Installed in September 2009 on the Banpo Bridge, former mayor of Seoul Oh Se-hoon declared that the bridge will further beautify the city and showcase Seoul's eco-friendliness, as the water is pumped directly from the river itself and continuously recycled. The bridge has 38 water pumps and 380 nozzles on either side, which draw 190 tons of water per minute from the river 20 meters below the deck, and shoots as far as 43 meters horizontally.This is what you will see if you visited Banpo bridge at night. Popular for film or musical video shot, its a nice place to visit only when you have time to spare!", April 2016
65,1.0,"Seriously, Don't go!","Nothing to see. Water spits out of one side, and you can not get a great vantage point. There is not much else around there, so it is Not worth your time.", April 2016
66,4.0,One-of-a-kind experience,"If you think a water & light show spewing from a bridge is absurd, I would ask you to think again. They play very calming music and the water dances to the beat. The surrounding area is nice and a lot of people come here to see the show and walk around the park.

68,5.0,AMAZING BRIDGE,One of the nicest place in Seoul to relax and enjoy! The fountain on the bridge was simply fantastic!, April 2015
69,3.0,Athmospheric place,"A long walk from the subway stations. But the athmosphere here is lovely in late warm evenings, pack up some picnic food with you! I was unlucky because the show was cancelled due to bad weather(?) which I didn't notice at all - in my opinion the weather was perfect, but maybe the wind was too much?", September 2015
70,3.0,A bridge with fountain,A bridge that have Rainbow Fountain. Should visit around late evening to see the fountain. Best place to see & shooting photo is at Hangang River Park., October 2015
71,3.0,A nice catch in the night,"If you're wondering what to do in Seoul during night time, maybe you may consider visiting this bridge. Please note that this place is quite far from subway station (the nearest one is Express Bus Terminal, CMIIW) and you still have to walk for about 1km to reach this bridge... So prepare your foot! This place is quite crowded in the night esp because I visit during spring. If you want to watch its rainbow fountain, make sure you check the schedule. Dont expect much about the fountain because basically it's just water falling from some pipes attached to the bridge with some colorful lights. And they give some familiar backsound during the fountain show (SNSD's Gee is one of it). This bridge is instagram-worthy tho.", May 2015
72,3.0,Not very accessible ,"I went with a high hope of watching the show of the bridge without knowing it only operates from April to October every year. I went in at the end of November, so I didn't manage to see the show. Furthermore, it is not very accessible and far from the nearest subway station. You need to walk quite a long distance before you can reach the destination. Might consider to come back again and watch the show in other seasons (except winter).", November 2015
73,4.0,Worth watching,"There's three ways to see this bridge with its fountains and colours: from the water, from the land and from the bridge itself. We took a boat cruise one night and were pleased to see the whole thing from a boat. So the other ways are unfamiliar for me, but as far as we could see there were people also on the bridge with cameras.Don't forget to bring your warm clothes specially during autumn time.", October 2015
74,3.0,Overrated ... not easily accessible; skip it if you don't have time,"If I have to choose between the Rainbow Bridge in Seoul and the one in Tokyo, my vote goes to the Rainbow Bridge in Tokyo;. The one in Tokyo is a suspension bridge crossing northern Tokyo Bay between Shibaura Pier and the Odaiba waterfront development in Minato, Tokyo. View from Seen from Odaiba - lamps placed on the wires supporting the bridge, which are illuminated into three different colors, red, white and green every night using solar energy obtained during the day. The bridge in Tokyo is easily accessible while the one in Seoul is quite difficult to access, with its convoluted instructions. We went in circles looking for the bridge in Seoul for more than half an hour. I was disappointed.", October 2015
75,3.0,Nice but quite far from the closest subway st.,"It's around 20 minutes walking from the closest subway st.but i have to say,the road to this bridge is nice.the rainbow fountain will be much beautiful if you see it from higher place.if you want to take beautiful pic of this fountain,you have to bring your DSLR..", October 2015
76,2.0,Only if you have time,"All the available information refers to it as Banpo Bridge Rainbow Fountain and suggests you catch the Subway to Dongjak (Line 4, exit 1 or 2) however, this is very misleading for the locals.  From my experience, no one seemed to know which direction it was in or how to find it.  I exited the Subway as specified and hoped to see a sign, arrow etc - there was nothing.  I asked a few locals and no one had a clue.  Then, I stumbled across some other tourists also looking for the Bridge and we went around in circles for 45 mins before we finally found someone who pointed in the opposite direction.  We started walking and it became apparent that this Bridge was a good 2.5km from the subway.  If you are not up for a walk in the dark get a cab and ask the driver to take you to Sebit Dungungseom (Floating Island in Hangang Park)...better yet, have your hotel write this in Korean for you and don't bother with the subway at all.  My fellow travelers gave up so I felt like I was on a wild goose chase...About 20 minutes later I came across some more travelers who looked lost and they walked with me for a while become also giving up...Over an hour and a half from arriving at the Dongjak subway, I arrived! What a joke. By this stage, I had lost all interest in the rainbow fountain but still had time to see it as it commences at 8, 8.30 and 9pm from April through October.The Floating Island has a large outdoor screen that was showing baseball and pathways to various restaurants, sporting areas. It was a hive of activity, as I imagine the Hangang Park would be during the day with all the bike and walking tracks.Keep walking past this as the sitting area for the Rainbow Fountain is under the Bridge across the road. There were about 50 people waiting for the fountain to start, some with professional cameras etc. To be honest, the actual show was a let down, but maybe my lack of interest was due to the palava in getting there. I stayed for 15 mins and then saw a taxi dropping off people so made a run for it.If I had kids with me it might be fun or if you were looking for a few hours to kill one night go for it but overall, I was disappointed.", October 2015
77,3.0,Not really wow...,"I went to the bridge with high expectation having seen water fountain displays is Vegas, KL and Macau. However this water fountain display is a bit of a let down. The music blasts from speakers that seem overloaded and the sound is lousy, and the colorful fountain is kind of average.if you are in the park, which itself is an amazing green oasis in the hustle and bustle of Seoul, it makes sense to go there on the way to the floating island. But otherwise it is not a major attraction in itself.", October 2015
78,5.0,Beautiful as it can get,"First visit to this world famous bridge in May 2015. The views are awesome as they have these fountains with colourful lights till about nine in the night. There is a hugh promenade where you can sit and relax, walk, chat with friends. There are dedicated cycling tracks which go along this bridge. Looking forward for a visit back soon.", May 2015
79,4.0,View the light show from a cruise for a different perspective,"The bridge by itself is nothing much to behold.  It's just one of the many bridges that span the Han River and links the city's north and shores.  In fact, during the day, it's really a boring looking bridge.  But at night, the light and sound water fountain show makes it for a magnet for locals and tourists alike.  The show's not bad but don't expect it to be mind-blowingly spectacular.  Having said that, it's free, so pick a good spot on the shore and enjoy.  But if one has the time or inclination, watching the show from an after-dark river cruise boat provides a different perspective on the same performance.", October 2014
80,5.0,rainbow fountain bridge,"very close to the express terminal station... i believe 10 min from the station exit. If it rains alot, the fountain will not be activated. The fountain show during summer is around 7:30.. 8:00 and maybe at 9? at around 8'oclock you are going to be faced with bunch of tour boats near the fountain. I recommend having a small picnic while watching the fountain show. there are good amount of spaces to sit around unless during the weekedend.. very crowded.", August 2015
81,5.0,For the romantic,"I went to Korea by myself.  So I came here by myself.  I might have been the only one that went by myself lol.  There are tons of people.  Families, friends and couples enjoy the park while waiting for the light show.  The light show was nice but definitely not as pretty as the pictures in google.  But still worth a visit.", April 2015
82,3.0,Family walk around town,"Walked down to the Bampo bridge from Iaetwon one night to check out the floating islands and the bridge water show. It was something different to see. It's cool, but not something I'd go out of my way to see. Definetly a cool stop if you're that part of town at that time of night or hanging out in the park along the river.", June 2015
83,5.0,IMPORTANT,"There are shows every half an hour, each lasting 20mins. Essentially it means 10mins without any activity. IMPORTANT: Fireworks on the 8pm show every Saturday only! The fireworks was a good 10-15mins long. If you can adjust your schedule, do pop over at this time!Sadly, unable to purchase chicken and beer to enjoy. However, you may wish to pop over to CNN Cafe just 2mins away.", June 2015
84,3.0,If I had a date,"This particular attraction was not quite what I expected. Perhaps it was the timing of the sunset and light show that was off, but the colors weren't as bright and vibrant as they appeared in photos on Google.

87,3.0,Alternative route to the Banpo Bridge Rainbow Fountain,"The fountain ""show"" itself didn't look as good as in the photos. I think it looks better from far.If you have spare time and want to have a look then you could get there using the route we took, which is different to the ones mentioned elsewhere and easy to follow. Also good for tired weary legs as it doesn't require much walking.Take subway line 6 to Noksapyeong (one station from Itaewon). Take exit 4 and walk about 50 metres to the bus stop. Take bus number 740, which should turn right immediately at the junction of the subway you came from. The bus route includes a ride on the Banpo Bridge. Press the button when bus is at the bridge so that the driver will stop for you to get down. Bus stop is just a very short walk to the pavilion where people can sit and watch the fountain show.", June 2015
88,3.0,Could be better - maybe not worth,"From what I read, I really wanted to see this bridge and  watch the water / light/ music show at night.   well, that was really disappointing.  The music is not loud enough and there is a constant whine coming out of the speakers.  The water just sprays and it's nothing really special, so don't feel bad if you can't fit this in.  Actually what was prettier, was just seeing the view of the city from across the river.  There are some nice restaurants over there  and it's peaceful and pretty.  I'm glad we saw that, just don't get too excited about seeing the water/music show.  most people were not paying attention to it.", May 2015
89,4.0,Relaxing,"It's a tourist attraction and local hang out place. I saw many local set up a tent, bring their own food and enjoying the precious moment with their families.

91,2.0,No show!,"I walked to the site from the Express Bus Terminal. I went there twice and was disappointed that they cancelled the show with an announcement the first time I went when it was supposedly scheduled due to wind direction change. I could understand that because the rainbow effect would have been distorted, unless they had different reasons for the cancellation. If you're the area by the scheduled time for the show, you may drop by here to chill, relax or exercise. The second time I went, I was again disappointed and this time there was no announcement. We just waited in the cold cold weather.  I hope they could make a timely advisory on any cancellation so people won't be expectantly waiting for a very beautiful fountain show as I have seen in some korean shows. In case of non-showing, I just shopped in the underground shopping of the Express Bus Terminal subway station.", November 2014

If you can speak Korean or have Korean friends you can even ask them to call and deliver to your location.", September 2014
93,5.0,Rainbow fountain from bridge over Han River,"A beautiful site, visible from many locations on both side of the river.  We were on the south side of the Han River at Hangang Park, which is a lovely space with greenery, an amptheatre, other seating.   Since it was Chousek, we are also treated to a fireworks display.    Families, friends gathered, brought picnics and enjoyed the musical from the bridge fountain and the fireworks.   The bridge ""plays"" broadcasts many songs and the fountain  (which runs the length of the bridge on both sides) changes the water spray and the colors in time with the music.  The bridge has 38 water pumps and 380 nozzles on either side.Very pretty site.   There are also lighted ferry boats cruising the river and under the bridge.  These seem to be available from the northern shore, so we didn't ride one.    We could see Seoul Tower at Namsam in the distance.    Very enjoyable way to spend the evening and wind down after a long day of sightseeing.   Definitely recommend.", September 2014

Unfortunately, once arrived near the bridge I saw absolutely nothing of what I was waiting for. No lights, no spectacle with splashes of water in short has been a disappointment. The bridge is normal and if it were not for the show I expected it is nothing spectacular.", April 2014
96,4.0,next stop after shopping,"It's a nice place to go after shopping at express bus terminal underground mall. After exiting from the underground, there's no more direction board but all you need to do is just walk straight along the roadside for about 10mins to reach banpodaegyo bridge. You can also buy some foods or drinks to have a river side picnic at there.(will pass by GS25 while heading to banpodaegyo bridge). If you're Chimac ( chicken and beer) fans, there's a chimac delivery service at there. The most important things is  make sure the lightshow schedule before you going. Quite crowded during weekend but nice view and very relaxing.", June 2014
97,3.0,No point going if you arent in that area,"I dont think it's worth going to see the show if you are going to make a trip just to see the performance. However, if you decide to shop at the express bus terminal before or after that, stopping by to catch the lightshow wont hurt.", June 2014
98,4.0,Spectacular!,"One word to describe the fountain show – spectacular! Watch it at night.To reach Banpo Bridge via the Seoul Subway – get off at Dongjak Station (Exit 1 or 2). Go down the staircase and head to the river. Then, turn right and continue walking along the river bank. You will pass Dongjak Bridge before reaching Banpo Bridge. The distance is about 1.5km away and a slow walk should take about 30 minutes.More on my blog:http://www.kenwooi.com/2014/06/banpo-bridge-rainbow-fountain.html", July 2013
99,4.0,not an attraction of the usual kind but I love it....,"Banpo Rainbow Bridge is not the usual kind of tourist attraction where you head there, gasp in awe and take pictures then leave. Its more of the experience of being there and enjoying the place as a whole. For a 1 liner review: Its a bridge with water jets spraying from the side with random songs playing in the background... **Most pictures you seen online are heavily contrast adjusted, lights are techically not as strongly coloured.BUT I believe its also the only place a tourist can order chicken to be delivered to you without making a phonecall. As you are walking towards the park, there will be many Ahjjusshis riding scooters circling the area like vultures handing out flyers. Pizzas, fried chicken, grilled chicken and beer is all available. Just let them know what you want, pay them and tell him where you will be seated. Everything will be delivered to you in 30min or so.It is rather a long walk from Express Bus Terminal Station, abt 15-20min. Directions are exactly as described on the official KTO site. Express Bus Terminal Station (Seoul Subway Line 3,7 or 9), Exit 8-1.Go straight for 250m, and turn right at the Express Bus Terminal 4-way intersection.Continue going straight for 400m and cross the road you were walking along.Go straight through the underpass to arrive at the parkIf not, take Bus 740 from either Seocho Station (Line 2) or Noksapyeong Station (Line 9), it will stop you directly at Banpo Hangang Park.SUGGESTION::: - Head over there if you are with a bunch of family / friends or special someone for a picnic.bring a mat (buy from Daiso) or just sit on the concrete steps!!!- Order chicken and beer from the Ahjjusshis!!! Be like how the locals are when you're there~~~ or bring your own food~~~ - Be there abt 6.30pm to catch the sunset, first fountain show is at 7pm on weekdays.** I highly suggest to stay on for the later shows, lights should be more intensed when the skies are darker.", May 2014
100,2.0,I was very disappointed,"I went there with great hope for a great photo opportunity. I was disappointed. Not only that it wasn’t that special, the colour wasn’t intense either. Also, this place is extremely hard to find and that you have to walk a very long distance to get there. Not worth it. On contrary, as I didn’t expected anything from the floating island, I found the lighting of the floating island is much better than the bridge, but still not worth the walk.", June 2014
101,1.0,what a waste if time ...,"we sacrificed itaewon just to go to this attraction. it was a very long walk from the subway station. waited for an hour, i.e. from 9:00-10:00 pm (twas a friday and the visitseoul.com mentioned the last show was at 10). the show was a no show. terrible!!!", April 2014
102,3.0,Nice but only if you have spare time,"It's best to sit by the edge of the river. Bring some snacks so you have something to eat while enjoying the show since there were no places to buy food when we got there. It's a nice show to visit but I would not recommend it if you have a very tight schedule. It is really more of a ""relaxing, enjoy the scenerery"" type of attraction. If you have spare time at night, after shopping perhaps, I would recommend to visit this place just to unwind. If you don't have time, it's alright, you won't miss much.", April 2014
103,4.0,Very Cool Night Attraction!,This is a really fun attraction and I haven't seen anything like it before! You can see the water and light show from either end as well as walking under the bridge.

105,4.0,Awesome rainbow fountain musical show!,Romantic rainbow fountain with great musics and lightings! Really worth a visit.We follow the directions given by the official website to alight at subway stn Dongjak only to found out that it's a 2km walk to Banpodaegyo and took us an hour to reach. Pathway is very dark and no signage at all. Luckily a helpful ahjumma walk with us to to the bridge.Later on we found out the nearest subway station is actually EXPRESS BUS TERMINAL STN which is abt. 20 mins walk. so pls do not go to Dongjak Stn.Do check online for the schedules of the showtime. It is not available from Nov - Mar., October 2013
106,4.0,Nice rainbow show,"we took a long way to the place. we got down from Dongjak Station and walked nearly one and half hours before we reach the place. so don't ever used this route.if you want to go take the train to NOKSAPYEONG STATION (629) instead. then take bus no 740 to the bridge. take note of the timing for the light show, it last for 15 minutes.we are really glad that we met a helpful couple who actually walked with us to the bridge and we manage to reach in time to see the light show. the place is very crowded therefore not easy to get a good seat.", October 2013
107,4.0,Take a taxi!,Getting here on public transport involves a lot of walking - I got the train but jumped in a cab to get me to the park. My advice is to take a cab to Banpo park on the south side of the river. And get a taxi back from that side too. Nowhere to view the show from the north side. Taxi back to Myeongdong from the park was 8500 won.Fountain show was cool - worth heading there for. Takes about 15/20 minutes., September 2013
108,5.0,Rainbow bridge,"This bridge has a fountain show in the evening at various hours.It was a long walk from the subway, when we got to the park we only had 2 minutes before the show started. It lasted around 20 minutes and the show had great music, lights and fountains. It was a great attraction to see and i am glad we gave it a chance.", September 2013
109,1.0,Warning - long longgggg walk from subway,"Advise from various websites including tourism organisation page directs us to the bridge from Dongjak Station exit 1/2. Upon arrival at the station, we found out from the ticket station that it would be a 20 minute walk to the bridge, which is the next one after Dongjak bridge. After a 20 minute rush to catch the last show at 9pm,we were only a third of the way through. Worst thing is, the fountain show is on the other side of the bridge from Dongjak. So even with the miniscule view of the bridge we had from where we gave up walking, we were only able to see faint glimmers of the fountain show that we were missing. My recommendation would be to take a taxi. Do not try taking the train there unless you're up for a 1.5km walk.", September 2013
110,3.0,Stroke of bad luck,"Looking at the pics, it could have been a nice place to be.It's also quite a long walk from the station.But the park was flooded, even the underpass was flooded.

112,4.0,Nice evening out in Seoul,"Interesting attraction - good place to set up a picnic blanket and enjoy some food with friends and watch the light/sound show. There are a number of local takeaway drivers on scooters that drive right up to you and shove menus in your face- but there are plenty of places to pick something up on the way, or a 7-11 in the park; worth a visit if you are looking for something to do of an evening in Seoul!", May 2013
113,2.0,No show,"We went in mid May 2013. We understand that the fountain should starts at 8pm, 8.30pm and 9pm but it didn't. Disappointed and not sure why the show didn't happen.

It is quite a walking distance from Subway and with the rain and cold wind blowing, you surely dont wanna be as disappointed as I am.", May 2013
114,5.0,Absolutely Not to be Missed,"I've just finished my second trip in two years to South Korea with the principal amount of my time spent in Seoul.  In my memory there are two outstanding sights not to be missed.  One is natural: the cherry trees blooming throughout the city -- I scheduled my trip after consulting the records of the dates of bloom in recent years.  The second is man made -- the water fountain show at the Banpo Bridge.   The bridge has reputedly the longest fountain in the world.  There are 200 colored lights on the span which is one of the many bridges in Seoul across the Hangang. (River Kang). Best to visit at night.   Call the multi-lingual 24/7 information service at 1330 to verify show times.  In April the evening show was a 8 p.m.  In the summer there are two evening shows.  The fountains with colored light are programmed to music --  which seem to have a preference  for Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman!  I've seen the fountains at the Belagio in Las Vegas many times but for some reason I like the Banpo Bridge better because it is so huge.  The evening show I went to in April, 2013 was about 20 minutes long.  It seemed much longer in summer 2011.  There is a viewing area where you may sit or stand along the river's edge.   You can also see the ""Floating Islands"", if you are lucky, you will also be treated to a  digitally programmed light shows.  Be sure to bring a video camera so you can rewatch this not to be missed experience.  We caught the taxi from Myeongdong -- the cost one way was only 6000 won. You can also get the subway  -- Dongjak Station (Seoul Subway Line 4), Exit 1 or 2.  I've done that too!!  Warning, in the summer, with a large crowd, it may be difficult to find a vacant taxi to leave the park.  You might have to walk through a short pedestrian  tunnel (cctv protected) to the ""next level"" of the roadway to get a taxi -- don't worry, I felt personally safe all the time I visited Korea.  In April, the weather was in the high 50's and clear.  There were only a few people there compared to the huge crowd in summer!!", April 2013
115,4.0,Nice view but a lot of walking,"A long walk from the subway stations and the streets leading there are small and dark but when you get there, your efforts are paid off.

The walk under the bridge has few interesting graffitis.  Rainbow cafe not too far away but we didn't go there anymore.", April 2013

It was nice, the weather was mild cool , I just wished they played more recent K-pop soft tunes and more recent english songs during the show.

121,3.0,Not in winter...,The show does not take place in winter--so keep that in mind. I walked over the bridge to get from the north side of seoul to the south and it was a nice walk because of the buidlings on the right side that are partly in the water--I'm sure there are festivals there like the APEC Park in Busan., December 2012
122,5.0,Moonlight Rainbow Fountain,This Moonlight Rainbow Fountain on Banpodaegyo Bridge is one of the must-see places on my list for this trip to Seoul. And I was not disappointed.

It's open only from April 1-Oct 31 & I was just fortunate to be there in October!., October 2012
