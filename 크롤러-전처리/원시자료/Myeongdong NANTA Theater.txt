0,5.0,Brilliant show! Well worth it,"We weren’t sure what to expect from Cookin’ Nanta we anticipated slapstick comedy and people shouting which isn’t far from what it was.

7,3.0,Great for children; mildly entertaining for adults,"Show is great for children and I wouldn’t say it was made for adults. Don’t get me wrong - the stunts and precision is amazing and the comedic elements provide much entertainment, but the show gets stale after 30 mins in as it relies on the same 1-2 punch throughout the 90mins.",10,26, January 2020,"Singapore, Singapore"

15,5.0,Don't Miss This!,If you do nothing else in Seoul you MUST see this performance. Think Stomp meets Blue Man meets Gallagher meets Benihana and then multiply it by 100.
