0,5.0,Peaceful and Insightful in the Middle of A Metropol.,Really this is one of the few places I enjoyed in Seoul. Seoul is by far one of the cities that I don't like and it is greatly because of the coldness and lack of warmth of its people. but still we like to travel to understand the past of every culture and the origins of their, January 2020
1,3.0,Spiritual ,"Guided tours in English, German, Chinese and Japanese are available at particular time slots. Guide services are included in the entry ticket. You can enter the shrine only at these time slots as part of a guided tour. Tours in English are at 10 am, 12 noon, 2 pm and 4 pm. We reached there close to 11 am and had to wait for more than an hour to get in. The  shrine is where memorial service for the deceased kings and queens are held. The rituals continue even today. Annually, a big ceremony is held. The buildings are very simple. None of the grandeur associated with royalty. Not many exhibits . Would not term this as a must visit place", April 2019
2,4.0,Informative tour,"Jongmyo shrine is a fascinating visit for anyone interested in Seoul’s history. You can only visit the shrine with a guided tour (except on Saturdays apparently) but the tour is included in the ticket price. The guide was passionate & informative & ensures to sensitive tourists to the meaning & customs of the shrine. The tour takes about 1 hour.  Definitely worth doing, especially if you don’t know a lot about Joseon customs & traditions.", November 2019
3,3.0,Good for a relaxing walk in the park and some Korean history,Entry to the Jongmyo Shrine is included in the Royal Palace pass but you can only enter with a tour - English tours are at 2pm and 4pm. A pleasant walk in a shady park on a hot day and interesting to find out about how the ancient kings were honoured but not as picturesque as the palaces in terms of architecture and decoration., September 2019
4,4.0,Shrine for the spirits of kings,I just thought of going there as it was near Gyeongbokgung Palace. Pretty interesting site/area. It's also listed as UNESCO Heritage site. Cost to enter was 1000 won per adult. Pathway leading everywhere was not to walk but for spirit...I was fascinated by it. It was very different shrine than others that I have visited., October 2019
5,4.0,Fascinating view of how the spirits of the Kings are honored.,"Easy enough to visit on your own.  Most days you can only go in during the hours designated to your language (a guide provided).  On Saturdays, no guide is necessary so you can view at your own pace.  Only $1,000 won per adult and free for those over 65.Be sure to stay off the main pathway which looks just like the central stone paths in the palaces.  Here, it is reserved for the spirits! :-)", September 2019
6,4.0,Because it is a UNESCO Heritage site?,Decided to visit the attraction because it was listed as a UNESCO Heritage site and entry was free because of the Chuseok holidays. Was nice to walk through a place of history and I liked the vast open space of the Jeongjeon area., September 2019
7,5.0,History on display,"I was doing a walk and stumbled upon this Shrine, and as it had free entry to celebrate a special day I took the opportunity to visit.The shrine is a green area within the city and has clear flat paths to navigate to head up to the shrine. To get from the path to the shrine there are 3-4 large steps. A ramp on the northern side entry might assist.The shrine itself was not open but you can see the building.There were several toilet blocks and also a covered pavilion.Worth the visit to this world Hermitage site", August 2019
8,5.0,A UNESCO Heritage site in the heart of Seoul,"A must visit site that can be visited ONLY with free guided tours provided on-site. English speaking tours are at 10am, 12pm, 2pm and 4pm. You are not allowed to join other language tours. On saturdays, you can enter the shrine on your own without a tour guide. Entrance fee is 1000 won incl tour guide", June 2019
9,4.0,Royal Shrines,"These Royal shrines are UNESCO World Heritage listed. The shrines are set in a parkland landscape. I strongly advise visiting on Saturday as this is the ONLY day self guided tours are allowed. All other days a guided tour is compulsory. The two main shrine buildings are impressive for their size. Entrance is 1000KW, the Royal Palace Pass works here. Watch out for the spirit way and don't walk across it!!", July 2019
10,4.0,Guided tours only,The only way to enter the shrine is through the guided tour offered by the staff. It is very organised and detailed. This is an interesting tour about ancestral worship for the past kings and queens. The shrine is included in the Royal Palace Pass along with the other palaces. A good deal if you have enough time to go for all., July 2019
11,3.0,"Not much to it, don't go expecting much.","Don't visit expecting to be blown away or see a something really mind blowing. The shrine was free for myself and my mother as we were on a tour, but normally it's like 1200 won I believe. There's some neat gardens and the tombs of the 19 main Joseon emperors. That's about it. Some decent photos, but nothing crazy. Once you start the walk you have to finish it, so if you're not sure about your legs, save your time. There are also lots of racoons walking around, but they don't bother people.", July 2019
12,3.0,Jongmyo Shrine,"The surroundings were beautiful, as you can see from the photos. I wasn’t overly excited by the shrine itself. Nonetheless, it was interesting to learn about the king, prince and spirits and the pathways designated to them through the shrine.", August 2019
13,4.0,Easy and Affordable Family Tour,"My family and I visited this shrine and were impressed with the beauty and history of the site that was easily accessible using public transportation and the price was affordable.  It can get hot, especially since the shrines are in wide-open spaces paved with stone, but the paths leading to the shrines are in the shade.", June 2019
14,4.0,Solemn environment,"This shrine complex is dedicated to deceased kings and queens of the Joseon Dynasty. It is used for memorial services and ceremonies. Unlike the palaces, the buildings are simple in design to reflect its solemness. Building layouts also reflect Confucius belief. Note that visitors can only enter Jongmyo Shrine in guided tour group at specific times on weekdays (closed on Tuesdays) and Sundays. Only on Saturdays, visitors may enter at their leisure. English guided tour schedules - 10:00, 12:00, 14:00 & 16:00hr.", June 2019
15,5.0,Interesting and peaceful ,I took the mandatory free English tour. Very interesting and well brought by the guide. You learn about Korean tradition and history and mostly about how they experience ancestry and death. The buildings are real and there is a sense of peace and awe in the air. Unfortunately both the tours here and at changgyonggung palace start at same times., July 2019
16,5.0,Peaceful & Educational,"Visited this UNESCO site during my trip to Seoul and was very glad I did.  The whole experience was fantastic and well organized.  This is the only site that requires guided tour to enter thus the crowd flow was manageable allowing visitors to take their time, photos and walk through the vast site to fully appreciate this piece of jewel of the past. Visitors must take note of the guided tour times and show up in time to join them. I didn't buy tickets ahead of time, just showed up at the ticket counter 1 hour before the tour, buy ticket and wait.  It was a worthwhile wait.  Highly recommended,", June 2019
17,3.0,PEACEFUL SETTING,Jongmyo Shrine is worth a visit if you are in the general area.. We were not able to enter the shrine.  For some this may involve more walking and steps than its worth.  It helps to have a guide--otherwise it is just a restful stroll.., June 2019
18,4.0,Lovely parklike setting . . .,"Not one of the ""must see"" places of Seoul, but if one is in the area it is interesting to visit the site where the ""spirit tables"" of the royalty and priviledged servants of the Joseon Dynasty reside. No, this is not a cemetary which is the final resting place for the body -- but rather the final resting place for their spirits.", June 2019
19,1.0,Get there on time,"Aparently you have to join a guided tour (except Saturdays and the last Wednesday of every month) which isn't mentioned clearly in official Seoul tourist guide. So when I arrived, the English tour already started and they refused to sell me a ticket for a Korean or Japanese tour. They only wanted to sell me a ticket for an English tour, which  I would have to wait hours for. The pictures look great, though.", May 2019
20,5.0,You may find this more beautiful than the palaces!,"After visiting all the palaces and temples in Seoul, I happened across the Jongmyo Shrine, where the spirit tablets of deceased kings and queens are enshrined. Most days you need to go on a guided tour (cost in May 2019 - just 1000 won!), offered in a number of languages. Because I arrived in time for the last tour of the day, it was in Korean. I was fortunate to have a bilingual family on the tour, who interpreted the main points for me. This has been one of the most serene and beautiful experiences of historic sites in Korea. The whole place exudes tranquility. I was fortunate to visit on a glorious afternoon, when the shafts of sunlight shone through the majestic trees in the complex. As our group of about 20 were the only people there, we were able to get a better sense of the history.", May 2019
21,3.0,Maybe on another day?,"If this was all there was in the area then it would be great, but there are some very impressive “competitors” nearby. On a Saturday, the main halls were closed, leaving you with some nice greenery and walk. But after your first 5 shrines, you start to get quite discerning", May 2019
22,5.0,Beautiful UNESCO Heritage Site,"The royal memorial site was filled with history and gorgeous outdoor scenery while still being centrally located within Seoul. Although we had to visit with a tour guide, I really enjoyed having someone so knowledgeable lead us around, teaching us about the historical significance of this special place. My son enjoyed being outdoors and made a game of avoiding stepping on the spirits’ pathway that runs through the property.", March 2019
23,5.0,A Beautifully Informative Spiritual Tour,"Entrance to the Jongmyo (Chongmyo) Shrine usually requires a guided walking tour which takes roughly an hour. Timing was on our side as we arrived fifteen minutes before the start of the English walking tour at 2pm. I loved how low-key sassy our guide was as she inserted some colorful comments in her informative spiel. Watch out for the cobbled pathway as the middle column is reserved for ancestral spirits to pass by! Upon hearing about this, everyone from our group was so scared of stepping on the wrong lane that we'd just wait for the guide to walk first, and simply pattern our steps after hers.Entrance to this UNESCO World Heritage site is included in the all-palace access ticket that's worth 10000 KRW.", March 2019
24,5.0,Peaceful and spiritual,"You can only enter the shrine as part of a tour. Even though we arrived 5 minutes after the English tour had started, they hurried us in so that we could catch up with the group. The place was beautiful and so peaceful. Our wonderful tour guide gave us a thorough history of the shrine and explained all the concepts simply. The shrine wasn’t too busy therefore we were able to enjoy the area as a small group and take many photos that were not filled with people! We would definitely recommend for an admission fee of 1000won (67p)!", April 2019
25,5.0,Spiritual and peaceful ,Great Confucian shrine of the entire Joseon Dynasty. The guided tour was well organised and informative. As a UNESCO World Heritage site shouldn’t be missed during the visit in Seoul., March 2019
26,4.0,Must see shrine since its also near changyeongung palace,has a 1000 korean won entry feevery cheaplots of places to walkmany kids learning historynear a train station, March 2019
27,4.0,a guided tour is a must,A nice quiet place that is one of Korea's World Heritage site. Join the guided tour for free. It is worth your one hour., December 2018
28,5.0,worth spending the time to visit this site,"We were there on a Thursday, and needed to be in a group with a guide. Walking freely throughout the park is only possible on week-ends.The 60 minutes visit was very interesting.", January 2019
29,4.0,world heritage shrine with well kept architectural structures and gardens,informative guided tour of this historical site which is rich in history and culture. location was serene and impressive. must visit., December 2018
30,4.0,"Very nice palace and gardens, the guided-tours only policy makes it less crowded than other similar historical sites","This is a very nice palace and gardens, and the guided-tours only policy makes it less crowded than other similar historical sites. It can only be seen from the outside, as the main buildings is a mausoleum, but inexpensive and definitely worth a visit.", December 2018
31,4.0,Interesting history,"Walking through Seoul looking for somewhere to eat, we realised we were close to the Jongmyo Shrine; so we decided to go inside and take a look around as tickets are not expensive. Through the gates, there is a medium sized complex with several different religious buildings, all of which are explained on the helpful signposts in English, Mandarin, and Korean.There is a good amount of information available on the history of the place, and the significance to Korean history. The whole walk around took an hour or so; it was worth the ticket price, but seemed more of a nice diversion to us than somewhere specifically to go to. It’s a pleasant park with historic and cultural significance, more than any specific museum or attraction in itself.", October 2018
32,4.0,Interesting place but I wish there was more to see,"Jongmyo shrine is a UNESCO world Heritage site. It is dedicated to the deceased kings and queens of the Joseon dynasty. The spirit tablets of the kings and queens are kept here and ritual ceremonies with music and dance still take place. It is a good example of a Confucian royal ancestral shrine. There are guided tours in Korean, Japanese, English and Chinese at specific times. The various buildings are interesting but some were closed  and could be viewed from outside. There were two that were open but we could not step inside them - we could only peek into them from outside. I wish there was more to see. The guide did a good job explaining the history etc.. I loved walking the grounds. The place is calming and peaceful.", October 2018
33,5.0,Informative guided tour,Recommend to join the guided tour where alot of history and cultural perspective will be shared along the tour journey. It's simply amazing when you imagine what's happened here in the past few hundred years of time. Definitely worth any penny where the tix price is only cost 1000krw., November 2018
34,4.0,Guided Tour of a Sacred Shrine,"Only guided tours ate allowed here. This is sacred to them so it really needs to be respected. We waited for the English tour for about 30 minutes.The tour lasts for about an hour. It was quite informative. The whole grounds was beautiful quiet and relaxing. If you ate coming here, you schedule it with the other nearby palaces in one day. Just be ready for a full day's walk.", November 2018
35,4.0,Lovely Autumn Colours,"It appears that you need to move around the site in guided groups without the ability to wander as you wish.  The disadvantage of this is that the guide who only spoke Korean spent a lot of time at each stop. He appeared to be knowledgeable but it meant much time waiting to move with the group when we could have been through the site in a much quicker time or spent more time taking photos when a lot of people where all milling around.The grounds had a lovely display of autumn colours.Also, people over 64 are given free entry but need some identification like a Passport to verify age.", November 2018
36,5.0,Serene and peaceful place ,"Definitely worth the 1000 krw admission tickets. However your will need to join the tour to get in, except on Saturdays. Do take note of the tour language listed on the website, different tours at different timings. The walking tour is about 1 hour", November 2018
37,5.0,A tranquil shrine in central Seoul. Must join the tour.,"Jongmyo Shrine is located in the center of Seoul, not far from Changdeokgung, and the subway Jongno 3-ga station. It is a very tranquil resort with very few people, because except Saturday tourists are only allowed to get in with the scheduled guided tour. There are 2-3 English tours each day. The earliest one is on 10 am. So do make sure of the tour schedule before arriving. Thanks to this policy, the tour experience is just excellent. The guide is a typical Korean lady in traditional Korean costume. Although her accent is not so authentic, the guide is good enough to let the tourists understand the background and the beliefs behind the shrine. The tour takes about one hour. It is not a rush. We walk easily around the shrine year, and have enough time to take photos,appreciate the surroundings, and feel the atmosphere. These make it the best experience through out our tour in Korea. Another noteworthy point is that the shrine are still performing its sacred role today; there are still praying ceremonies held here every year.", October 2018
38,5.0,Historical and Splendid,Reading about the Shrine in historical books gives you a background of how important it is in Korean history., October 2018
39,4.0,Only tour allow except Saturday,Please check the time before go as only tour is allow. Anywhere it's a free tour. We are lucky as we know chinese and english cause the tour is 1 hours each switch between chinese and english. Even though not able to enter the shrine building but the view is nice and we got a lot of history information of Korea., October 2018
40,3.0,Jongmyo,"Consider purchasing the royal palace pass that includes 4 palaces and the royal shrine for 10,000 (approx $8.80USD) and be sure to pick up the English brochure at the entrance.This property is on the UNESCO list of masterpieces of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity.There are tours offered in Korean, Japanese, English and Chinese.Weekdays and Sundays you can enter the shrine only if on a guided tour...Saturdays and the last Wednesday of each month you can visit it without a tour.", October 2018
41,3.0,"Good to get tour, avail in several languages.","Did a guided tour in English which helped a lot. Very serene place to visit. This is a shrine and so has a more sombre feel and vibe to other sites. Very large area to walk. Took one hour to do tour, but glad to do it and get an insight into the history and background to the Shrine.", October 2018
42,5.0,Loved this place,It can be a bit tricky to find the entrance. If you are coming from the palaces you need to walk to the South gate of the park. Free entrance on the last Wednesday each month. Beautiful shrine and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A bit crowded like everywhere else., September 2018
43,4.0,Peaceful oasis in the centre of the city,"The well-shaded gardens provide a peaceful respite in the middle of bustling Seoul. If you don't arrive in time for one of the limited foreign language tours, your experience may be a bit limited though, as information signs are limited and the guidebook is not very informative. So check what time the tours are in your language before you go.", August 2018
44,1.0,Not worth visiting,"Visited the shrine on a rainy day in August 2018 and did not enjoy the English guided tour at all. First of all, the paths were quite muddy. Secondly, you cannot visit the shrine without being in a tour. Thirdly, most of the main buildings are closed and open only two times a year (sometime in May and November, I think). Fourthly, it is almost an impossible task to explain Confucianism in an hour guided tour and the guide said she wouldn’t even try to do so. This place is designated as a UNESCO site purely for historical reasons, nothing spectacular in here. Not very interesting unless you are into Korean imperial history. One positive thing I should comment on is the generosity of the Seoul heritage society. Admission was 1,000 KRW, but like Gyeongbokgung Palace, the fee would be waived for seniors (65 years or older) if you have a document (passport or driver’s) to prove your age - even for foreigners.", August 2018
45,4.0,Peaceful walk,"The buildings and scenery are very calming and serene. Walk through the park and imagine the spirits walking next to you. There's a short 13 min movie that plays on a loop in the park to educate you on the history. The cost for my wife, son and I was about $3 us. Sat and Mon you don't need a guide. All other days you do. Glad we did it.", August 2018
46,3.0,Visit ruined by poor English language guide,"Visited with a friend who booked us on an English guided tour. The shrine is a very important place as it houses the spirit tablets of deceased Kings and Queens and was one of the first structures built in the Joseon dynasty. Ceremonies are still held there and the interiors are open for viewing on 1 May every year if I remember correctly. The tour took us round the buildings which we can only see from the outside and we were told about the raised platforms/walkways - in palaces the highest is for the King but in shrines the most raised path in the middlle is for spirits. There are only limited times, I think Saturdays, where it's permitted to wander around the grounds without a guide. Unfortunately the guide we had was so poor she was incomprehensible most of the time so I would much have preferred to have been given the freedom to wander round on my own and read any information boards available. My Korean friend found the guide hard to understand to. A real shame.", July 2018
47,4.0,Kings and Queens Memorial Hall,"This huge area with many buildings for kings and queens memorial, since it's very big, you don't see much tourist, which is a big change from most attraction, more relax as you walk.", June 2018
48,4.0,Calming place,"It's not as impressive as the bigger palaces in regards to the buildings but this shrine is well worth a visit, especially on days when you can freely roam the site. It's in the heart of the city but once inside it feels as if you're in a different world, hundreds of years ago.", May 2018
49,5.0,Lovely shrine - a highlight,The visit I made to this shrine for one of the English language tours was a real highlight of my brief visit to Seoul. I would highly recommend the tour - the group was not too large and the commentary provided interesting. It was fascinating to learn about the shrine's history and the belief systems associated with it. Our guide would point out elements of design that were in line with feng shui principles and she provided lots of useful context.I loved how mortals are not allowed to walk on the path reserved for the spirits..!The trees and blossom at the shrine were very pretty and we were lucky enough to spy some racoons who had made their home in the proximity of one of the shrine buildings., April 2018
50,5.0,Land of the Morning Calm,"Although this was my fourth visit to Sth Korea, this was my first to Jongmyo Shrine and the first for my wife. What an amazing place of calm and serene step into nature and stunning architecture. This is a UNESCO World Heritage site and rightly so. Don't just walk through, take the time to sit and breathe in what the place has to offer but please respect to religious significance of the site and where they are sign that ask not to enter, please don't. The resting place of the spirit tablets of the kings, this place is deep and still the centre of Korea's most significant Jongmyo ceremonies. I am so glad we got the opportunity to visit.", May 2018
51,3.0,boring but spiritual,There is a walk way only for the spirit! I love itThe garden is beautifulThe buildings are so boring but impressive because hugeIt s something different compare than the Palace nearbyBut why not, May 2018
52,3.0,"Except Saturdays, only accessible on guided tours.","You can only get in to the Jongmyo Shrine Zone as part of a one hour guided tour.  1000krw.   (Except Saturdays.).   English tours were at 10, 12, 2 and 4.    If you need to kill some time,  the Gwangjang Market is only a couple blocks away.    The park setting is quiet, serene and somber.     If you’re interested in learning about Korean customs as they related to burials and mourning of dead kings and queens, this tour is for you.  If you’re looking for spectacular burial vaults and furnishings, look elsewhere.", May 2018
53,3.0,Nice but less exciting than other nearby historic sites,"A friend and I took an English language tour of the Jongmyo shrine over the winter. It was a lovely, serene place and the tour was interesting. We got some beautiful photos of the historic buildings in the stark winter setting. I'm glad we visited but I found some of the other nearby temples and palaces more exciting. Our guide told us that in November and May they have two fantastic large festivals on the grounds of the shrine. It would probably be more fun to go during one of those times!", March 2018
54,4.0,"Interesting historical site, worth a visit. It's affordable and fairly quick.","The shrine is located in downtown Seoul, near the East Gate. We started the morning off there with a quick metro ride from City Hall station... we saw the East Gate and the shrine in a couple of hours. The shrine is fairly big but quick to walk through. There is a walking path and recommended path as well as restrooms inside the walls of the shrine. There was some construction in the corner of the grounds at the time we visited but didn't seem to impact the experience much. Worth a visit if you have the time, it's one of the more affordable historical sites and one of the quicker ones to see along with the East Gate, just outside down the street.", April 2018
55,5.0,Took the Korean Language Tour,We missed the last English language tour. The last Korean language tour was an hour later so we just waited and joined that one. Visitors have to be part of a guided tour every day they are open except Saturday. If you just want to see the buildings and don't care about the information provided by the guide it's okay to go on one of the other tours. Staff made sure we knew it was not an English language tour and gave us a brochure in English. We were expected to stay with the tour which was fine with us. It lasted about 40 minutes., April 2018
56,4.0,Very serene,"You need to visit as part of a tour, so check out times before visiting.  It is also closed on Tuesday, unlike the palaces which are closed on Monday.Once inside it is a very serene area.  Hardly any people compared to the other tourist areas, so it is a much calmer atmosphere.  Architecture is great, makes for some great photos.", April 2018
57,4.0,Peacful,Very peaceful place.   Great for walking around enjoying the day and traditional korean architecture.., March 2018
58,5.0,As an archaeological site,It is a place where there is a magical place.There is a quiet corner. Can be taken as a souvenir in many angles. Feel like a time in the past. Keeps the mind calm. Spacious place.It is a historical site that gives tourists a sense of the vapor of the culture of this country in the past as well., May 2017
59,5.0,The necessary first stop before anything else in Seoul. ,"The tour is 1 usd or 1000 won, last one hour  and the necessary first stop in visiting Seoul. The guides were very informed, less crowded andgave historical and religious tidbits that you won’t get in the palaces or shrines. I enjoyed it more than visiting anything else during my time in Seoul.", March 2018
60,5.0,Must visit,"I know it's not a big place, but It is super interesting everything they told us, and what we've seen was amazing.  Just do not forget the times of tours before visiting, you cannot there without the tour.", December 2017
61,3.0,Check the Schedule for Different Language Tours,"KRW 1000 (US$1) admission.  Free tours in English most days of the week beginning at noon.  If staying nearby, this makes an excellent first stop since the guide explains much of ancient Korean history, belief and culture.  Will add context to the rest of your sightseeing!", February 2018
62,3.0,Serene Confucian shrine,"We lucked out on the timing of our visit as we arrived a few minutes before a tour (in English) was due to start. (From what I could tell they only offer one to two tours a day in English with the rest being in Korean) Anyway, attending a tour is the only way to see the shrine as entry is extremely limited due to the sacred nature of the site. While our guide did her best to explain to us the historical and spiritual significance of this place, she spoke so rapidly and with such an accent we were lucky to catch even a word or two every sentence. Not her fault as her English was much better than our Korean but it really detracted from the overall experience. Overall, an audio guide tour with docents along the way ensuring you did not trod in any incorrect stones, would have gone over much better. (There are quite a few places where you are not allowed to walk as they are reserved for the spirits of the predeceased Joseon kings and queens.) TIP: instead of paying for each site individually (palace or shrine), buy a multi-pack which gives you access to many sites for a much lower price as is good for 3 months.", February 2018
63,5.0,Filial piety and confuscionism ,"Admission fee at only 1000krw (500krw between 7 to 18 yrs old, under 7 and above 64 free entry), Jongmyo shrine is a wonderful visit. Unlike the palaces, this is a shrine an therefore  you could only enter as a guided tour. There are guided tours with Korean/ English/ Japanese or Chinese speaking guides. Please look up the photos attached for more information.Generally speaking, my sister and I have been to all the palaces and weren't expecting much from this shrine as it was off the beaten path and ""usual"" attractions that tourists would opt for (as it sounds a little more solemn)However for the entry price, the view and a guide to guide you through the rites, customs and korean psyche, why Not?Without giving too much spoilers, would recommend tourists to give this place a chance. The tour itself will only take 1 hour. Certainly easy to slot into your busy day. You could also then walk from this shrine to Changgyeonggung palace (20 minutes walk at an extremely slow pace. It was only 12 minutes for sis and I)Hope you like it", February 2018
64,5.0,"Peaceful, cultural and so interesting!",Jongmyo Shrine can only be visited as a guided tour except on Saturdays. I went on a guided tour and our guide was wonderful. Her English name was Clare and not only did she speak about the shrine but she highlighted the culture and psyche of Korean society as a whole.Learning a little more about the cultural context was really enlightening and has helped me understand the people here a little better.The shrine itself is simple and solemn as it is a place for spirits ;) I really enjoyed the quiet as that was in stark contrast to Seoul as a whole.Would definitely recommend!, January 2018
65,5.0,Learned a lot about spiritual practices!,"Although it's somewhat inconvenient to have to go with a tour inside the shrine, it was great to have a guide through all the buildings and explain the significance of the design and the practices that occur(ed) inside the shrine. Just look up tour times as you plan your day so you do not have to wait around to join a tour.", January 2018
66,5.0,Peaceful well led tour,"I came just before 4pm and managed to get in with the last English tour of the day. Due to the tour format of the shrine, it is not overly crowded like some palace tours. Our guide had excellent English and discussed the ceremonies and histories in detail, and how a recent ceremony had just taken place related to New Year. She also recommended good photo locations and spoke to each of us at some stage to get to know where we are from.The shrine feels like a quiet and calmer venue compared to the nearby palaces and was a relaxing tour to end a hectic day of palace touring. I got good value from the combined palaces and Jongmyo shrine ticket.", January 2018
67,5.0,A Must Go for Photographer!,"Was very lucky to arrive in time for a free Mandrin Guided Tour provided by the Jongmyo Shrine. The very talented guide 李圣林小姐 have us a very educational tour throughout the shrine for about 90min. There were plenty of photo opportunities. Thanks to the morning snow as it provided a very different texture to the whole landscape. Do remember to bring wide angle lens or you will not be able  to cover the whole length of the shrines. The guide gave vivid description and explanations of the buildings, the historical stories, the people involved and significance of the shrine. We enjoyed the tour,the friendliness of the guide and cery beautiful scenes for nice photos. As there's only one toilet nearer to the exit. So do be prepared as the whole compound is pretty big. A full 2 hours may be adequate for the trip.", December 2017
68,4.0,Interesting Place and Hystory - Quick visit,"Jongmyo Shrine is a nice place, easy to get there and the guided tour is around 60 minutes. It is interesting to know the history and culture of Korean ancients.We have been there in the winter, but we saw some pictures during the Spring and it shall be awesome.", December 2017
69,4.0,It was a fabulous place indeed,"We went there without any knowledge about tour guide.There are nominated days we can enter without tour guides, otherwise we must be with a tour guide in order to see inside.The tour are from morning to at around 5pm but each tour runs in different languages such as English, Korean, Japanese and so on.Not all languages go through at the same time, so I suggest to check the time of your language in advance.However the tour is so useful that we can understand deeper meaning of buildings and histories.As I remember, this one is nominated as one of cultural heritage of Unesco, so it will be more interesting!", September 2017
70,5.0,Subdued ornamentation for a reason,"This shrine is plain compared to the palaces you'll visit as part of your combination ticket, but that's because it's meant to be a place of reflection on the lives of the deceased rulers. Still lovely to see the difference as compared to the palaces.", December 2017
71,4.0,Guided Tour Shrine ,"It is definitely something neat and historical to see in Seoul, but the downside is that you have to take a guided tour of it. I would have preferred to walk through at my own pace and see it. The tour was a bit too long for my liking.", December 2017
72,5.0,Serene,Best to take a guided tour to totally understand what it meant for their ancestors.  Love it's serene surrounding and its purpose., November 2017
73,5.0,Very interesting but be wary of ticket restrictions,A highly interesting hour long guided tour around this wonderful heritage site. Thorougly recommended but make sure you check entry times and restrictions - for example tickets for guided tours in Korean are only allowed to be sold to Korean citizens even if you only want to view the buildings., October 2017
74,3.0,Not a great deal to see,"One of the six places to visit if you buy the Palace Pass for W10,0000, like the other five, this is a complete rebuild of what stood here centuries ago. It's all rather samey, with the same decor everywhere and none of the buildings are open to visit. You just wander the nice gardens and the courtyards. There is a small museum right of the entry gate which is well worth seeing, but you have to take your shoes off.", October 2017
75,5.0,Jongmyo Shrine Review,Interesting place to know more about Korean culture. Good to have guided tour inside. Very well protected. Landscaping is also wonderful. Relaxing place. But after visiting here starts to wonder what is written in those tablets., October 2017

77,4.0,Very interesting,This is a good place to learn about Korean culture.  You need to join a tour to see it (except on Saturday). Go to the website to check out times for your language. It costs 1000 krw including the tour. You will learn lots if you are new to Korean culture like I was., October 2017
78,4.0,Quite different compared to a temple tour,"Except for one day per week (Saturday I think) the tours are guided, around 4 per day in English. Worth the visit. Our guide was good, and explained plenty. This was very different to a temple tour. Unfortunately the 2 buildings containing the many VIPs' individual shrines are not open to the public! Good to hear the details of the place, and to see the buildings, but pity we couldn't see inside the main buildings.", September 2017
79,4.0,"Good to relax, learning history","This shrine is having a wide area. There aren't many visitors. It's good to relax walking and watching trees and old heritages.It'll be more fun by learning how this place used and what each spots are.There are Gwangjang Market, Changdeokgung Place and Changgyeonggung Place locating closely. Connected tours to them are also nice.", September 2017
80,5.0,Beautiful serene place,This is a beautiful serene place in Seoul buried in history and home of lots of ancient traditions. I had the pleasure of having a great guide who explained many details that otherwise would have gone unnoticed. This is a great tour of only an hour and for a bargain price!, September 2017
81,5.0,Beautiful site,Information about the deceased was interesting and the landscape was beautiful. Good place to visit on your trip., September 2017
82,4.0,Shrine tablets,"I visited this shrine on a Monday. Note it is closed on Tuesdays.Visits are by guided tour only except on Saturdays and the last Wednesday of every month. If you choose a guided tour note that it takes about an hour and there are only four tours in English per day, at 1000 and every two hours after. The visit costs W1000. There are notices in English if you decide to go for a self-guided tour.Note that there are no people buried here. It contains shrine tablets of the kings and queens. The buildings are not lavishly adorned which is supposed to reflect the solemnity of the shrine.There are 7 buildings, two of which are small. The main hall is the biggest and most impressive of the buildings.Well worth a visit.", September 2017
83,5.0,Interesting history - quiet and spiritual,"A spiritual experience to visit one of Korea's most sacred sites.  The English tour starts at 10am, so be there on time.  Very informative.  Not much to see, but the site itself and the shrines are full of history.  Tour took 70 mins, and it was a very touching, peaceful and thoughtful experience.  Highly recommended.", August 2017
84,5.0,UNESCO World Heritage,"Located at Jongno3(sam)-ga Station (Seoul Subway Line 1, 3, 5) and Exit 11. An interesting place to visit. Many locals gather there to play chess which could be an interesting sight to see. Free admission with guided tour at different timings. Good for a historic tour :)", April 2017
85,5.0,Historic Shrine - Fantastic Must Visit,You must take a tour to visit this place and their were only 2 english tours per day at the time we visited. Our guide spoke perfect english and was very informative about the resting place for the Emperors. The Gardens here were beautiful and not only were we told about the burial and mourning processes for the Koreans it also gave a very good insight in Confucianism. The guide was happy to answer any questions. The tour was a little fast (about 1 hour) and you did not have the opportunity to explore as you were kept together as a group however that was all part of being in a sacred place. This was by far one of the best attractions our family visited whilst in Seoul., July 2017
86,4.0,Interesting place.,We went here on a very hot an humid July day.  If you go here any other day than a Saturday you have to take a guided tour.  They run every 20 minutes but are in 4 different languages so if you timing is off you could wait and hour and 20 minutes for a tour in your language.  We were lucky and turned up just 3 minutes before the english language tour. Might have rated a lot lower if I had had to wait for an hour.  Anyway interesting tour takes about 50 minutes.  Learnt a lot about Korean history, July 2017
87,5.0,Travel with palace official guide!,"I love guide service, that shows Korean would reserve the historical place for new generations. Guide will take you around the place, for English guide time every 10AM, 12PM, 2PM and 4PM.  For admission, I took the combination ticket (10,000W for 4 palaces and 1 shinre valid in 3 months). Transportation, take subway to Jongno 3-ga (Line1, exit11; Line3, exit8; Line5, exit8)", June 2017
88,4.0,Important shrine - worth a visit if you have time ,After the palaces this can appear plain in comparison however it is an important site being the final resting place for the emperors. There is not much to see although the buildings and grounds are well kept. Worth a visit if you have time.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful., June 2017
89,4.0,"Lovely, interesting royal shrine","This is a Confusian shrine housing the spirits of deceased kings and queens of the Joseon Dynasty that is located within a peaceful garden.  We took a 1 hour English tour (tours are required most days) and it was quite good and provided some interesting insights into Korean history, beliefs and attitudes.", May 2017
90,4.0,First Impressions.,"This was the first historic, World Heritage Site I visited in Seoul.  It sits in parkland giving it a tranquil feel in the midst of the busy city.  We visited fairly early in the morning which may have contributed to this.  Tickets were available which included entry to the main palaces nearby which was useful.  The buildings were largely devoid of objects and the experience was somewhat diminished by this.", April 2017
91,4.0,The spirit of royalty is unmistakable,"The shrine is a truly serene place, which helps explain why the curators only want visitors there on guided tours (which are exceedingly good value at KRW1,000 and available without booking ahead). Otherwise you'd have hundreds of people tearing around the place, shouting, trampling across sacred areas and taking selfies every five feet. It's an hour very well spent in a location that helps you build a better understanding of what Korean cultural heritage is about. To be recommended.", May 2017
92,5.0,Soul of Korea,we had the guided tour in English and found it very interesting. It is an Unesco world heritage site but perhaps not easily accessible to everyone. I did not regret the visit to understand the korea soul., July 2016

98,3.0,Timed Entry...,"...beware. You can't just turn up. You need to buy a ticket for a timed, guided tour. The guide was very informative but I'm afraid after 2 weeks in Seoul I was a bit culture-blind and didn't really appreciate it.", April 2017

104,4.0,Lots of history,"This place is located in the city like most of the attraction in Seoul.  I was surprised to find out that is not the typical Shrine like in other Asian country.  This is actually where the believed they needed to keep the souls of those pass rulers of South Korea.  Is a very simply Shrine but if you book a half a day tour for a couple of dollars, your tour guide will explain all about it and this really makes it worth the visit.", March 2017
105,5.0,Hints on this place,"1) Usually only guided tours are allowed. But on every Saturday and last Wednesday of every month you can visit this place without a guide.2) Admission fee is 1000 won. But I strongly recommend you to buy a Combination ticket for palaces and Royal Shrine. It includes 5 palaces, Secret garden of Changdeokgung Palace and this shrine. Costs 10000 won, but great economy for you if you are going to visit these places!3) This one of the places where you can feel how really old is it. In Korea it's not in every place so, because all palaces are reconstructions.", March 2017
106,4.0,"Quiet, beautiful, interesting story",It's quiet compared to other palaces because it's only allowed guided tour inside. The story about Korean history is interesting. It is not as beautiful as other palaces as limited access and smaller. Need to check time schedule before coming to save time. Best visit is in Autumn., November 2016
107,4.0,Unesco,Its unesco world heritage place. Very beatiful place n only can be visited with guide tour. The admission ticket only 1000 won., August 2016
108,3.0,It's Unesco,"I got off the bus at Jongro in front of Jongmyo Shrine and saw the Unesco sign, I did not pay to get in.", February 2017
109,4.0,Different. Serene. Beautiful. Unesco site. Recommended! ,"This place is only available to visit on a guided tour as it is a sacred place for the royal ancestors. Plus it's a Unesco world site, so they do not want unguided tourists to damage the place. Only 1 day per week is available for unguided tours or during national holidays. So check your timings for guided tours before going!There's no need to make any reservations on their website. Anyway the link goes no where! I tried several times but doesn't work. The shrine is very near Jongno3ga train station on Line 1. Just exit 8 and walk straight, turn left and its there!Best to go on a guided tour as the guides are very knowledgeable and you can know good information about the area and history from them. As this place is a sacred area, please be respectful and no running or playing around. Also, the stone paths are for the spirits, so don't walk on them! It's very different from the palaces so it's an interesting visit. Recommended!", February 2017
110,4.0,Excellent Spot for Cultural Preservation Junkies,"Yes, it's quiet and yes, it's not a palace - but Jongmyo is still in use 1x a year (May) for a ceremony honoring the imperial Joseon ancestry which was designated by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. Really pretty stunning, even during the winter months. Would recommend visiting with a guided tour, but not necessary. If you go - don't want on the center path: it's reserved for the spirits (and the whole thing was built for them)!", November 2016
111,3.0,Not a palace,It you are time poor then skip this one. The buildings are impressive but miss the finer details of the palace's.  Much of the place is just painted red. Entrance is from the south of the park., January 2017
112,5.0,recommend to koreans as well as foreigners,Plan your visit! This place is only open at set times when the guide can take you around. You are not allowed to roam around by yourself as it is sacred. There are a few times in the day that the guide is given in english or another language. The information from the guides is really useful and we appreciated it as we went around seeing the shrine. A place I'd recommend to koreans as well as foreigners., November 2016
113,5.0,The must be religious place in Seoul,"The place can only be visited with guided tours during the week and I highly recommend the visit. I went there in the last English tour of the day (around 4PM) and was able to take some great shots during the beginning of the golden hour. The tour explains several details not only about the shrine itself but also from Korean history, I enjoyed a lot and can't recommend enough a visit here.", January 2017
114,4.0,Where spirits walk!,"With a designated stone pathway for the spirits (I guess the royal spirits of the Joseon Dynasty) to walk on, I assume the grounds of this shrine are ""considered sacred"" and that may be for the reason that on these grounds are two ""long buildings"" that house the royal tablets of all the Joseon kings (not exactly sure though what those tablets consist of & what they look like since the buildings cannot be entered).  And the environment here was ""absolutely peaceful"" which I would say is partly due to the somewhat-wooded nature of the place (quite a number of trees on the grounds & in the vicinity) and partly due to the control on the number of visitors at a time in the way of a guided tour which I'm pretty sure they only do one tour at a time (there were only about 15 people in the tour that I was a part of).The tour lasted an hour with the main stops being the two ""long buildings"" where the tablets are stored (as mentioned above); and for those of you who like me have also been to Sanjusangen-do Temple in Kyoto, Japan, you'll find these two long buildings here (which by the way are ""quite identical"" to one another) look quite similar to the long building there that houses a thousand multi-armed Kannons; the difference here though is that each of these two long buildings has a ""big stage"" in front (connected to the building) which is kind of paved with stones although I'm not sure what the purpose of those stages is.Coming by subway, the nearest station is Jongno 3-ga (on Lines 1, 3 & 5) which is just about a 5-minute walk from the Shrine.  And as mentioned above, you can only go in as part of a guided tour (except I think on like one day of the week when you don't need to be in a tour, but I'm not sure if they still limit the number of people at a time on that day), so be mindful of the tour times especially if you want to be in a tour according to the ""language of your choice"" (one of the English tours is at 4 pm, but I got there close to 3 pm and couldn't wait for the 4-pm tour so just went with the 3-pm Chinese tour).  And as for the ticket, I suggest getting an ""integrated ticket"" for 10,000 won which covers this shrine and four of the five palaces of the city (namely Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung & Deoksugung) and which is valid for like a month; do keep in mind though that Gyeongbokgung & this shrine are closed on Tuesdays and the other three palaces are closed on Mondays, so what I did during my week in Seoul (four days actually) is I did Gyeongbokgung & this shrine on Monday and the other three palaces on Tuesday.", June 2016
115,4.0,Jongmyo Shrine,"- visited November 2016- it may be a good bargain to purchase the Royal Palace Pass, worth 10000 won, which includes entrance to Jongmyo, plus four other palaces- atmosphere was solemn and quiet, which, for me, is good for taking a long walk- it was late afternoon and almost closing time when I was able to visit so there were few people and better photo ops- wasnt able to take guided tour, but i think it would have been better with a guided tour", November 2016
116,2.0,Worth a visit only during ceremonial rites,"Jongmyo is a huge compound with 2 main halls housing spiritual tablets of deceased Kings and Queens. Unsurprisingly the buildings are subdued and solemn. We visited on a Saturday - the only day you can visit without a guided tour. Personally, I would not recommend a visit to Jongmyo if you are short of time. However it would be worth to visit to watch the royal ancestral rites known as the Jongmyo Jerye and the royal ancestral ritual music known as the Jongmyo Jeryeak.Do note the long straight stone pathways - they are meant for the spirits.", December 2016
117,5.0,Ambassadorial Escort narrative service with exception low admission fee,"It is one of the 7 Cultural heritage sites in S. Korea, and one of the 2 Cultural Heritage in Seoul. Also talking about ancestors' royal families shrine still leaving behind now only be found in 3 countries in the world, Vietnam, China and S.Korea. Surprisingly that, the volume of visitors were low in particular for Chinese visitors. Looking at the frequency of foreign language narrative service, you will find Japanese speaking rank most, and English speaking second, while Chinese speaking sessions, might have 3 times a day only. Disappointing! Admission fee is less than 1 USD, believe it or not. You will be taken care of by a professional escort speaking the language you chose, either Japanese, English or  Chinese (putonghua), leading you from entrance to every track, building, temple, shrine and stories. Stunning perfect! No individual visit allowed, and have to stay in the admission time slot per language narrative service, so, please check in online first, and be alert that, it close on Tuesday.", December 2016
118,3.0,Take the tour with the guide,"I went on this tour today with an English-speaking guide. I think if you don't have someone to explain the history and significance of the shrine, you will really miss out. The price of admission is only 1000 won and the guide is free. So then you get all the interesting facts and have a better understanding of the buildings. The tour is only about an hour.", December 2016
119,3.0,Nothing much to see.,"This was another UNESCO World Heritage site which we were excited to see but it was a letdown.  These was just a compound with 3 major buildings, 2 of which were used to store the tablets of the kings, queens and other noblemen.  Since there was no tour on the day we visited, we really could not appreciate the shrine.  And the buildings were all close.  It would have been better if we could see a glimpse of a tablet or how it looks like, even just in an audio-visual presentation.", December 2016
120,5.0,Worth a visit! ,"I personally liked this place than KyungBokGung  palace. Our English guide was great. It is very historical and beautiful. And it was only 1000 won. Just check the time table of tours when you visit. They have Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese. Even locals can't go in without the tour guide.", December 2016
121,4.0,Worth visiting,"Nice temple and garden area, entrance less then a euro, with english guide lasting a good hour.Area is very nice and part of the korean history, the path of spirits inside was interesting.", November 2016
122,5.0,Different atmosphere than a palace.,We took a Japanese guided tour(English tour is more frequent) and it took us for about hour and half? The guide lady was nice and we usually don't take guide tour in Korea but was very worth it. It is located only 5 to less than 10 mins taxi ride from Myongdong area. Looked pretty interesting and very local feeling to walk around the area., December 2015
123,4.0,"Jongmyo Shrine in Seoul, South Korea","We took the 2pm tour on October the 20th and we had a guide that was fluent in English which was a great help to understand the history and use of the buildings. Visits are only permitted with the guide. The shrine is dedicated to the member of the royal family of the Joseon dynasty. The main building is very long and has 19 chambers where the tablets of the teaching of the kings are enshrined. This place is a highly recommended, and the access to this shrine can be bought together with other monuments by getting a Royal Palace Pass.", October 2016
124,4.0,Educational ,"Jongmyo is the old royal ancestral hall. Many Eastern Asian countries have their own version of royal jongmyo (called Tai miao or zong miao in Chinese) including China and Vietnam. The Seoul jongmyo is not the biggest, however, it's the only one that is still in use.  The descendants of the last royal family still comes twice every year to perform the traditional ancestor worshipping ritual. The ritual disappeared in most eastern asian countries. The ritual is open to public, unfortunately I missed it by a week.", November 2016
125,5.0,Serene and educational,"We went on a weekday. To note, in weekdays you do need to go in with a tour guide. After this experience, I would recommend doing it with a tour guide as opposed to going around yourself. The staff was very educated and very informative. We were given time for photo ops at each location. The shrine showed a rich Korean heritage and culture of respect, which I loved. I thought this would not be a to go to spot. But I'm glad we went. Con -  you have to stick to the tour guide to hear what they say. Tip - buy the palace package for all sites 10,000won instead of paying for each entrance fee separately. Max time spent there was 1 hr.", October 2016

127,3.0,Historical and quiet,"I found this place by accident as I was walking from Jongno 2-ga to Changdeokgung. On the map it showed a large garden in front of Changdeokgung so I walked near. In fact it is not part of Changdeokgung but is a most-respected shrine. The ticket office could not say much English except ""Conducted tour"". Anyway I bought a ticket for 1000 KRW and was fortunate that a tour just began. I followed the group (a class of young students) but could not understand what the Korean tour guide said. The place is historical and there are two main buildings. The architecture appears to be quite simple and straight-forward and is unlike that of Changdeokgung. Interesting place, as it is not commercialized like the other tourist hot-spots. Saw some small wild animals (squirrels, etc.) It is probably worth visiting if you have time after seeing the nearby palaces; just a 10-minute walk from Changdeokgung along a quiet lane.", October 2016
128,4.0,Interesting place,"They have screening of a movie that details what's done in the shrine. It's a confutionist shrine, which mean he looks basically like all the other historical buildings in Seoul. Nice stroll, not much about it.", August 2016

131,5.0,Beautiful,One of the things I admire so much about Asia in general is the respect for ancestors.  This whole shrine is a memorial for prior kings.  The grounds are beautiful and peaceful.  The buildings are lovely.  The English tours are about 3 times per day.  This shrine is only accessible with their tour., September 2016
132,5.0,Worthy visit,"This is one of the most popular attractions in Seoul. You get the sense of Deja Vu. Access is available to connecting palaces and attractions. Not that expensive to enter. Good metro connection at Jongno, lines 1, 3 & 5", August 2016
133,5.0,Tour must be guided,You cannot freely go there and roam around. You must be guided. Check the time for your language tour you prefer and show up within half hour. It is because it is a shrine for the dead kings that its sanctity must be respected., August 2016
134,3.0,A quick visit.,"Having visited the palaces and had a lot of time to explore, we were hoping to take our time while visiting the shrine. Unfortunately access was only through a guided tour, though on our ticket it said there were no guided tours on Saturday. I don't know if this means that it is closed or you can go through the area on your own. The tour was about an hour long. The guide gave us some information but it seemed rather rushed and wasn't clear which is why we rated it a little lower than other attractions.", August 2016
135,4.0,A world heritage site that enshrines Korean Spirit,"This shrine is a world heritage and cant be accessed by individuals, and you should join a tour to enter, the tour is free and is a MUST.

Enjoyed a lot and oh by the way, dont step on the spirit's pass!", August 2016
136,5.0,Very nice and quiet place with great architecture. ,We went there on a weekday so it is required to have a guided tour. It was very interesting. The tour guide was very nice and answered a lot of my parents' questions about history in Korea. The place is not as crowded like the other palaces around town. Mostly because you need a tour guide to get in. You won't regret it if you like the history., June 2016
137,4.0,Silence in the city,"Once you entered the park, a silence surrounded you in the middle of the city. I went on a Monday with an English guided tour. The guided tour is indeed helpful as there isn't actually a lot to see by yourself. The explanation helps to understand the buildings and the park. 1k Won is nothing to discuss about it further the nice tour guide speaks very good English.", July 2016
138,4.0,Very interesting,Jongmyo Shrine it was very interesting .Too old history .The place a bit not busy .but very nice ..., February 2016
139,4.0,Loved it,It was amazing. A great place of attraction. I would say it is comparable to the Gyeongbukgong Palace. We werent allowed to enter without the tour guide and guided tours were only allowed at certain timings. The whole place seemed mysterious and sacred. Relatively cheap entry. It did not seem as popular with tourists as the main palaces., July 2016
140,4.0,"Quite nice, not as inspiring as Changdeokgung, can't enter without joining a tour","It's worth seeing the main square alone, and the entry fee is very reasonable, it's a unique site as it's a memorial to many of Korea's past kings and queens, but it was a bit underwhelming to see this after visiting Changdeokgung Palace.Unfortunately apart from Saturdays when you can walk free (and Tuesdays when it's closed), you're forced to join a tour as they only open the front gate when a tour guide is there. I did try to wander off and see things for myself, but a guide approached me and (rather politely) asked me to return to the tour as there were many CCTV cameras around... whatever that means. I'm not sure if he thought I was going to break the rules or something. Not to worry, I left halfway through the tour and no-one was too concerned when I went for the exit.You can join a non-English speaking tour if you arrive outside the English tour times, as the ticket inspector didn't seem to care what time I entered. Check the official website for tour times.", July 2016
141,4.0,Peaceful shrine in the heart if Seoul,"This shrine requires a tour to visit but the price is low and the tour guide explains this site well and timing is perfect (not too slow or too rushed). The place feels a bit quiet and empty (especially if you visit in winter as opposed to spring). This place is historically very important and a must see if you have at least 3 days in Seoul. get the Seoul palace pass and this is included (4 palaces plus Jongymo Shrine and the secret garden tour for 10,000 Korean Won).", April 2016
142,3.0,Check the schedule before you go,A pleasant enough spot and worth a visit as it plays a significant role in Korean cultural identity. However you have to take a tour which only happens every 2 hours so if you miss one you will be waiting around. Not a highlight of any trip to Seoul but worth an hour of  your time., June 2016
143,5.0,Saw the Shrine w/Seoul-Mate Students!,"Getting the free tour of the shrine (entry was 1000 won, though) from the Seoul-Mate University students was awesome.  There were six student tour guides for our group of four.  Each of the students had 3x5 index cards that had notes on the key points of the shrine.  Our group would never have appreciated the history of the shrine if not for the wonderful students of Seoul-Mate!", May 2016

I had to go on pretending to know Korean 12:20pm as I would be running late for my next schedule. It's a must to enter with a group except on specific holidays. Luckily the English group was running a little behind schedule so I got to join in!Beautiful peaceful shrine with detailed Korean architecture. One of the must dos!, May 2016
146,3.0,Average tourist spot,"Not great but nice, note that you can not walk around by yourself but have to wait for a tour, tours are offered in different languages at different times.Worth to spend 1000 wons and about 20 minutes", May 2016
147,5.0,We were lucky to see a free show,Since we have visited the shrine during a festival we could see a free traditional show with actors dressed up in 17th century royal korean outfits. There was a photo session time as well as recreation of an event from 17th century. The Shrine itself is nice and it is a place where the spirits of dead kings and queens visit and are summoned according to Korean tradition, May 2016
148,3.0,Closed doors..,"We visited the shrine on Friday an hour before closing time. We were not aware of the mandatory tour guide until read on TA now. Back then, we were allowed to walk freely, but the doors of the shrines were all closed. So we were not impressed at all, more like walking in the park. Think better to join a tour guide next time..", May 2016
149,4.0,A glimpse from the past,"Walking inside the shrine is surreal. I felt that I've experience their tradition. They really respect the stones around. They don't step on it. They offer guided tours in different language. Make sure you check it before going there. I joined the Korean tour because we can't wait for the English tour.However, I don't recommend this place during your winter tour. They only allow guided tour which lasts for an hour. If you want your fingers frozen, go here during winter. LOL.", January 2016
150,4.0,Great culutural experience,"Jongmyo Shrine is a great cultural experience though not exciting architecturally. It's a pretty austere Confucian place so the attraction is in the atmosphere and the cultural relevance of this shrine. As such, the guided tour is a must-do. Mind you access is by guided tour only so check out the opening hours in advance.", April 2016
151,5.0,Beautiful shrine,"You can reach this shrine via train at Jong-no station exit 11. Then you just have to walk less than 5 minutes to reach the shrine. We visited on a Thursday so there were few tourist in the area which is good. They are not open on Tuesdays and some other days require you to have a tour guide so before you visit, I suggest you double check their schedule online. We got lucky they let us in on that day without a tour guide. There is an entrance fee of 1k won for adults. The shrine was huge and the red gates were really pretty. There is a changing of guards ceremony every 2PM and that is also something to look forward to.", February 2016
152,4.0,Watch your days and times,"This is probably the largest Shrine in Seoul, and we visited it as part of a group ticket for 10,000Won with all of the major Palaces.  That said, by itself, this is one of the cheaper ones to visit by itself (1,000Won).All of the Palaces and Jongmyo are in pretty much the same area, and accessible by the metro.But the trick to visiting the Shrine - and the reason for my heading - is that most times you can't just rock up and expect to stroll around by yourself.  In most of the Palaces, you can.  We didn't appreciate that as we hadn't done our homework.  You can only wander around by yourself on a Saturday and on the last Wednesday of every month.  Otherwise, you must be on a guided tour (Korean, Japanese, Chinese or English), and they only run a set number of times a day.  We turned up only to find we had to wait an hour and a half for the next English tour.Hmmm.  ""Can we join the Chinese tour that leaves in half an hour?"".  ""Can you speak Chinese?"". ""Not very well"" (by which I meant I can order a number 7, 23, 27 and fried rice off a Chinese takeaway menu).  Nevertheless, they let us join the Chinese tour and the guide asked me the same questions.  We just weren't allowed to leave the group.  Of course, we couldn't understand the commentary, but we had the brochure and many signs were in English.  So we got to see the Shrine - better than waiting for the English tour or not seeing it at all!", March 2016
153,4.0,"Impressive shrine, only guided visits","It is a walk from the nearby Chandeokgung Palace. There are English guided tours. The venue can only be visited with a guided tour, which is really very interesting The shiorne itself is closed to the public, but a spirit chamber has been constructed for visitors to appreciate. The whole tour takes about an hour. Guidelines are given to respect the shrine area,a s this is a traditional religious monument.

I also love how is so well priced and entrance is strictly via guided tour so you can get great pictures and all the information required and more. A truly comprehensive understanding and a guide that takes the time to let you explore and explains. Truly a worth Unesco world heritage site and also has a intangible component which is rare to have one place associated with both tangible and intangible world heritage. A absolute must do in Seoul!!", February 2016
157,4.0,Enjoyable,This is a UNESCO site and it's got lots of history inside.  You can only visit this by joining one of the free guided tour.  We had a lovely lady guide taking us around.

We reached the shrine at around 12.40pm and was lucky that we understood Chinese and could go for the 1pm tour. As it was a cold day, there were not many visitors and we were the only 2 in the Chinese tour so we had the privilege of having Ms Lee as our private tour guide! Ms Lee spoke perfect Chinese and was very knowledgeable on the history of Josen. Her detailed explanation helped to add meaning into the architectural structure and the history behind it. She's also very approachable and open to questions. A very quality free tour which help us appreciate more of the shrine!At the end of the tour, Ms Lee even gave us her heat pack as it was a very cold day and she knew that we are going to visit more places thereafter. A good place to start if you want a general overview of Korean history and kings/queens.", January 2016
161,4.0,Serenity in Seoul,"For the rushed tourist, there are several things to say. First, the neighbouring King's palace or the secret garden on the other side are bigger and there is more to see and do. That said, the main building in the spiritual sanctuary is the most prolifically profiled place in Seoul and worth seeing for that alone. Second, like the Secret Garden, there are regularly timed intervals with a guided tour. You can not simply come and go as you please (as you can at the royal palace). There is also an English guided tour at 2PM. Amazingly peaceful place. As it should be given it is the memorial shrine to countless kings and royalty.", January 2016

This was quite an interesting place with beautiful scenery and architecture.The guide was very informative and knowledgeable. We were however allowed to walk and see certain areas only.

It is a very simple and short tour, with the guide sharing details of the ceremonial procession at each site. The tour lasted less than 45 mins. When you are there, avoid walking the central line as it is meant for the ancestral spirits. There are signaled informing on this too. To get to jongmyo shrine, take the subway to Jingmo 3-ga station, take exit 8 and walk straight after exiting until you hit a T-junction. Turn right.

However, you can visit independently on Saturdays.Here you will find Confucian style shrine complexes which were used for memorial services for deceased kings and queens of the Joseon Dynasty who ruled Korean from the late 14th century until the end of the 19th century.  The Jongmyo Shrine grounds include four main clusters of buildings which you can browse around. Most are not open to view inside but you can appreciate the symmetry of their design and layout as well as the significance of their presence here. As you walk around there are a few opportunities to glimpse into open halls, allowing you to view panelled paintings and shrine altars. Throughout, you will find signage at important walking path junctures, providing details regarding the shrine buildings in front of you.

174,3.0,Peaceful But Lacks the Beauty of the Closer Palaces,"Visited here while in Seoul and seeing the temples in the nearby area.  The Shrine allowed only a guided tour, which made the visit much longer that I could have done on my own.  Though interesting from the historical perspective, the Shrine lacked the beautiful grounds like I saw at some of the neighboring palaces.  If seeing all of the sites, then it makes sense to hit this one as well.  But if limited on time, I would recommend seeing the palaces instead.", October 2015

Circling the entire block took us around 40 minutes. When we tried to purchase tickets, the lady told us ""no"" with an explanation in Korean. Reading the sign, we realized that unless you visit on Saturday, entry is only allowed with a tour, and there are set tour times.

The parklands of the shrine are beautiful and teeming with wildlife.  We spotted some rather large black squirrels and a raccoon that was completely unconcerned by our presence.The shrine it's self is austere and solemn while still obviously a place for royalty.

There is no particularly big, or  fantastic architecture here. Although main building is very unique for those in architechture, for most of us, it is just a one-storied building.

194,4.0,Nice Korean Shrine,"I feel a bit bad about not giving gushing adjectives about this very nice, historical shrine.  It is well- maintained and quite elaborate, but it is quite similar to many shrines around Asia.  Our benefit was going the last Wednesday of the month, allowing us to walk about the place at our own pace.  The best parts were the semi-open historical items to see and the photo-op area with people in character (? priests for tablet rituals).  I would still say it's worth the visit (and knock out your shrine list all at once).", July 2015
195,2.0,Very boring,"The background to this site is very interesting, being the repository of the tablets and seals of deceased kings and queens, but the actual site is quite boring. The sacred nature of Jongmyo means that all of the shrine buildings are locked and there is nothing to see!

200,5.0,Right place/Right Time - First 'Meet the Palace' festival,"Coincidentally, our trip to Seoul and Jongmyo coincided with 'The First Royal Cultural Festival - Today, We meet the Palace'. We went to Jongmyo on Friday 1st May and paid for entrance as normal - the complex is impressive with the 2 main Halls and other smaller buildings. We learned that the festival started 'tomorrow' so after looking around the complex we returned the next day for the start of the festival at Jongmyo. There was a procession starting outside the walls that came inside the complex and went on to ceremonies at the main halls. Today there was free entry and we were able to get a good vantage place and watch the procession. Not really understanding the nuances of all the costumes etc. it was a great show. It was a coincidence which added to the enjoyment. I expect that this festival will be held every year so look out for it in the May time frame as it also relaxes the rules for sightseeing in other Palaces etc.", May 2015

Centuries ago, ritual ceremonies were held several times a year for the deceased, five times in Jeongjeon Hall and three times in Yeongnyeongjeon Hall.  The Jeongjeon Hall is the main hall , is the most important part of the shrine. In front of this hall stretches a massive elevated stone yard surrounded by walls  on all sides. Initially there were only seven spirit chambers but alterations and additions were made in the coming years until there were 19 spirit chambers making Jeongjeon a very long wooden building. When Jeongjeon could no longer accommodate, Yeongnyeongjeon was built. When it was first built it had six chambers but was expanded to accommodate 16 chambers in the end. Unlike the roof of Jeongjeon  which emphasized the long horizontal line, the centre section of the roof of Yeongnyeongjeonis elevated  Jongmyo shrine is inscribed on the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage List in 1995.

Entrance is cheap if compared to other sites, only w1000 and children under 7 are free to come in. We came here and took the english guided tour at 10 am. The guide is a pretty korean girl but most of the time we couldnt understand her english. However, we got the part where she said the pathway which is on the center of the entrance is for the spirits to pass by and i was standing right on the pathway 😱😱😱😱. The shrine is the place to have ceremonies to call the spirits of the previous kings, but the actual burials are not here. Inside the buildings there are tablets that represents the kings and queens, but we didnt get to see them as they are all behind closed doors. The place is interesting with lots of trees n traditional buildings, nice to take pics though the guide was quick to escort around the complex.", April 2015
208,4.0,Unique set of buildings,"While you do need to go on a tour to visit, it only costs 1000 won and is about an hour long.  The English tours are at 10 am, 12 pm, 2 pm and 4 pm.  The tour was quite interesting and, even though we didn't have the freedom to explore as we would have liked, the guide did give us some room to roam a little.  The buildings are unique and I have not seen anything like them in my travels.  I write about temples and these structures are certainly pretty unique.", April 2015
209,4.0,Remember Family Ancestors,"Jongmyo is a home to many ancestor kings and royals of Korea from 13th century AD.There are 5 main open preserved buildings in a vast walk able area with signboards in Korean and English languages about importance of each, ancient rituals and prayers performed to keep about 50  sprits/souls in peace and happy.There is a small hall with comfortable floor seats where one can watch a 30 minute video explaining Jongmyo importance, reminding one of our duty to our forefathers- queens are missing.Guides in English,Japanese, Chinese and Korean are available to groups at fixed timings. Look up their website and enjoy your meeting with souls.Entry Free on Wednesdays.USD 1 on other days.", March 2015
210,3.0,Guided Tour Needed,I bought the combo ticket that included tickets to the other shrines as well. On most days you need a guided tour and can't walk around freely. I was put with a Korean guide so I didnt understand a word she said. Luckily I had an app that was a guide for me. Its a huge complex with lots of open space. Beautiful to see but its not something I would say you HAVE to see. It is totally skipable., March 2015
211,4.0,Home for the spirits of Korean royalty,Took an hour-long tour of this shrine and found the history to be very interesting.  We were told this was one of the few places not destroyed during the Japanese occupation period.  Suggest you try to determine when the ceremonies are being held here by the former royals and observe their traditions.  We only saw pictures on the tour., March 2015
212,4.0,You MUST book a guided tour to enter,"There are a few slots for the guided tours under different languages and it is a must to book the tour to enter this sacred place. Very interesting to learn about the shrine, amongst the main palaces in the area.", January 2015
213,3.0,Guided tour mostly..,"Except for one or two days, most days you need a guide to see the place. And except for 2 days in a year where they have a special ceremony to honor their monarchs, there's really nothing much to see. Just a long building with closed doors. The tour is quite informative but that aside, there's nothing to see.", January 2015
214,5.0,Very quiet and historical place,"I bought the combined tickets for the four main palaces in Seoul and almost didnt notice that I also had a ticket for visiting Jongmyo Shrine. It is only possible to visit it on a guided tour, which actually is pretty good cause otherwise (personally) I would not get half the history and meaning of that place. It is a very quiet and interesting place to visit and learn a bit more about Korean culture. Definitely recommend it.", December 2014
215,3.0,Jongmyo Shrine,"You can purchases a combi palace + shrine ticket if your travelling to most of the palace and this shrine.Please do take note of the various timing for your language each day before traveling to this place. You are only allowed to go in in a tour group, which also means that if you miss the timing, your not allowed to enter unless you want to follow a different language tour group (means you probably not going to understand anything)The tour consist of the main areas, but not the insides of certain places and structure. If you would like to tour the place by yourself, please go on saturday (IIRC).", December 2014
216,4.0,Interesting place,"From a lot of blog sites, I came to an understanding that this place was like a 'freebie' on the combination ticket we got for the palaces tour in Seoul. Don't be fooled though. This place is just as great as the palaces.We were to go to the Chandeukgung that day but missed out on the closed day (Monday). So we ended up going to Jongmyo Shrine, which is about 15 minutes walk, straight from Chandeukgung. There is lack of street signs but you can ask the people around. We met a Korean guy who couldn't speak English but understood where we were heading too. Similar to the other tours, take note of the guided tours time. If you decide to walk on your own, you may again be wondering what is all the buildings are for and may even step on the wrong path. There's a stone path which is only for spirits. You wouldn't want to be angering any.The tour was interesting and the place was pretty. There guide explained a lot about the buildings. You wouldn't be able to understand a thing if you walked on your own. Tour was about an hour.When we were there, the opposite of the shrine was on renovation. Wasn't sure what was there but looked like it was a worth a visit.", November 2014
217,5.0,I like this place the most!,"There are less tourists, so we get to enjoy the serendipity of the place. They have a very interesting culture and unlike the palace, they have a room that shows a video of how the rituals are being done, which helps us to understand more rather than through reading alone. It is a short walk from the train station.", November 2014
218,5.0,Good Historical Experience of Korea's Past,I love the serenity of this place where tablets of the past Korean kings are placed in the long hall. I would definitely recommend this place for those who wish to learn the history. Do note that you can't go in on your own as you need the local tour guide from this place to bring you around. This is some sort of a sacred ground so be respectful and follow the guide's instructions., June 2014
219,5.0,Beautiful and interesting,"We went to the shrine on a weekday, fir one of the english tours. The tour took about an hour and the guide spoke english very well. The grounds are beautiful and Im so glad it was during the Fall because the colors were gorgeous. So much fascinating history and culture. My husband and I throughly enjoyed it all.", October 2014
220,5.0,"the only, oldest, complete, ceremony in the world","Jongmyo Shrine is a primary place of worship for kings throughout the Joseon Dynasty and has  been registered as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site. All ancestral tablets are originally preserved even we have suffered from wars several times. The more important thing is the Jongmyo Memorial Service is the oldest and existing ritual ceremony in the world. This is not a busy  tourist attraction, but a meaningful and historical site deserved for visit.", October 2013
221,5.0,Interesting cultural experience,"Very interesting shrine and surrounds. As we were there on a Saturday, our visit was self guided. This UNESCO heritage site is well worth the visit as it is said to be the resting place of the spirit tablets of korean kings and queens.", July 2014
222,5.0,"Amazingly Lovely, Great Cultural Experience","Jongmyo is a huge park in the middle of the city. The resting place of the ""spirit tablets"" of the Korean kings, it is an oasis of green in a busy [but fun] city. I took three US work colleagues here and they rated it their favorite experience in Seoul. Now, definitely do some planning. You can only enter on a language tour for which you speak that language. All Western languages have to go on the English tour! On Saturdays the English tours tended to be at noon, 2:00 and maybe 4:00. Ask your hotel to call or check with Tourist Information. The cost is low. This site is near the subway and is convenient to a couple of the royal places. I've been thrice and all three tour guides spoke good English and well amazingly well-ifnormed. This is a great place to learn some Korean history and Confucian culture. Well worth the visit.", August 2014
223,5.0,A must-see while visiting Seoul,"The Jongmyo shrine is a UNESCO world heritage and dedicated to the kings and queens of an ancient Korean dynasty.It is def. one of Seoul's Highlights and should not be missed at all. Access only with a tour, so it is highly recommended to pre-book one.", July 2014
224,1.0,Rude personnel,"As others have said, one has to visit this shrine with a guided tour. Fair enough. The problem is that, as a foreigner, one is compelled to take the tour in English, and only a few are offered, so bear that in mind before wasting your time.I had just enough time to join a tour in Japanese. Waiting for the English tour would not have left me enough time to head back to the hotel, take the airport limousine, and catch my flight. I tried to explain this to the guides and the ticket sellers, but they would not listen at all. As soon as they learned that I do not speak Japanese well, they declared that it was ""IMPOSSIBLE"" for someone like me to join that tour (their words and emphasis). They kept shouting the word IMPOSSIBLE to my face and they were increasingly rude and close minded.(I am Mexican, as a matter of fact. There is no tour in Spanish. Would it be ""IMPOSSIBLE"" for me to visit this shrine if I did not speak English?)I think that this decision is discriminatory. I had already paid my ticket (I had a combination pass that includes Jongmyo). I just wanted to enter and take a look. Of course, it's always a plus to be able to understand what the guide says, but entry should not be forbidden in case one does not. This is not a classroom!There are signs in four languages in all the other shrines. Had they needed me to understand something in particular (such as ""take off your shoes"" or ""do not take pictures"") I would've been able to understand.I share this with you here because there's no space for comments on the official website.One sometimes wonders if national anxiety regarding the history of Japanese-Korean relations is having too much influence on Korean museums. Might it be possible that different information is being conveyed in different languages?", July 2014
225,4.0,One of the best things in Seoul,"Jongmyo Shrine is one of the most beautiful things to visit in Seoul. You need to follow a guide (there's one in English, one in Chinese and one in Japanese) in order to understand the Confucian view on life that inspired the construction of the shrine. Make sure you check the time of your guided tour (which is for free).There is the possibility of renting (for free) strollers and wheelchairs.", July 2014
226,4.0,Visit if you got spare time,"This shrine is small. You can only enter this shrine through guided tour so make sure you check the time of the guided tour before you arrive, otherwise you will have to wait for your tour. The shrine is relatively small, and most of the doors are closed (off limit for tourist). However, like the guide said, you come to this shrine to understand the thinking and culture of Korean, not so much about the shrine itself; the shrine is only a representation of their thinking and logic. So I think it is worth visiting if you got some spare time.", June 2014
227,4.0,Interesting tour,This is an interesting shrine in the centre of seoul near the other palaces. You have to go with a guide and she gives an interesting insight into the Confucian view of death and the importance of respecting parents and ancestors. The buildings are set by large courtyards where celebrations are held twice a year and it is a very peaceful place with many trees., May 2014
228,5.0,Tranquil and picturesque shrine,"Took us a while to find it because of all the maintenance work around but once we were inside, we were glad we did try to find it. Without the tour guide, we were able to enjoy the scenic view, with well-placed buildings dotted in a nice park. Entrance fee was cheap, so it was a good stop.", May 2014
229,5.0,Serene and Interesting,"I really think this should rank higher in the list of attractions.  I normally dont like guided tours but this one was really superb.  It was a very interesting, educational and picturesque place.", November 2013
230,3.0,Nice to visit on your way to Changdeokung Palace,"I visited on a Saturday and was misled by the reviews which said this was a guided tour only. True except on Saturdays!Without explanations from a guide, you get the point about the use of this shrine but it is not so interesting. Yet as other visitors wrote, this place is sober and elegant.Closed on tuesday, english guided tour only at 10:00, 11:00, 14:00, 15:00 except on saturday. You can just visit by yourself without a guide and anytime on saturday.", April 2014
231,5.0,"Only guided tour, but very good","Only 1000 won to get in but you can only visit with the guided tour.  Arrived about 10:07 and they still let us in and told us to catch up to the tour.  The tour guide was extremely informative and explained the history of the shrine.  Learned a lot more than we ever would have if we could have done this self guided.  In Dec 2013 when we went the front was all under construction but the Shrine is still open behind it, so don't be deterred by the construction in the front.", December 2013
232,5.0,"Very informative tour, beautiful sights, be aware of English tour schedule",Great place to learn about Korean culture and belief about the dead. Simple yet elegant grounds. It snowed on the day we visited so it was especially beautiful. Very informative tour. The official website is not extremely helpful in terms of tour schedule. We went according the the website but found out that they posted new/different schedule at the entrance. Still worth a visit!, December 2013
233,5.0,Really liked the guided tour,"The guide gave us an interesting insight. She explained a lot about the kings, sacred places,...The place itself is very sober because it's the place where the spirit of the kings rest but it's still very interesting to see.Closed on tuesday, english guided tour are at 10:00, 11:00, 14:00, 15:00. Be carefull, except on saturday, you can only enter the shrine with a guided tour! You can just visit by yourself (without a guide and anytime) on saturday.Fee : 1000won", October 2013
234,4.0,Respectful,"The only day you can enter the Shrine without going on a tour is Saturday so if you are there on another day you will need to time it with a tour in your chosen language, the tour takes about 50 minutes. The english tour was very informative and gave a good insight to the Korean culture and belief on their deceased and without the tour I think you would miss the true meaning of the Shrine.It was very peaceful and with the autumn colours in the trees it made for a beautiful backdrop. I would recommend buying the combo ticket for 10,000 Won.  It includes Gyeonbokgung, Changdeokgung, Secret Garden, Changgyeonggung and Deosugung. When I was at the shrine there was no line to buy tickets but all the other palaces was quite long so get the combo ticket from here.", October 2013
235,4.0,Peaceful gorgeous shrine,"The smallest of the temples in central Seoul, simple, leafy, peaceful, beautiful. Good english-language tour.", October 2013
236,5.0,Palaced-Out? Try Jongmyo Shrine!,"After visiting a few palaces that celebrate the lives of the Korean royal families, the Jongmyo Shrine is a totally different experience. This 14th Century Confucian shrine pays tribute to the souls of the royals of the Joseon Dynasty, and is a well deserved listing in the UNESCO World Heritage sites. While the Joseon royals lived in the royal palaces, their bodies were buried in the royal tombs, and here in this royal shrine is kept their souls. Of all the royal sites we visited, this was the only one that was quiet, peaceful and serene throughout our visit, despite the fact that it is in the heart of a busy city. Perhaps this lovely setting is protected by the fact that it is only open to groups except for one day each week, or perhaps we were just lucky, but this serenity was a wonderful antidote to the noise and crowding of most other sites.Consider the all-inclusive ticket that covers admission to four palaces and this lovely shrine. It costs 10,000 Korean Won, about $9.50 US. Once a year in May, there is a ritual event in which the dead are honored and the buildings are opened to reveal the tablets on which the souls are remembered.", October 2013
237,4.0,Simple yet interesting,We had this tour on a Friday where English language tour was available at 2:00PM.  The place was simple. What makes this place different and interesting is that it showcased Korean culture and their belief on their deceased. The place has quarters for both the living and the deceased.Some of their pathways had a three level where the middle is elevated whereas the two sides were of the same level. It was eerie to learn that the middle is for the spirits so visitors were not encouraged from stepping on this plane.Recommending this tour as it is a tribute to Korean heritage to families and groups as it is interesting., August 2013
238,4.0,Confucian heritage,"Most of the week this shrine is only open to tours.  The tours are free, but there are restrictions on certain tours, based on your language and residence.  For most tourists this will not matter.  For example, the English language tour is not available to Koreans.  We were lucky this day, as we arrived at 1400h, just after the English tour had started.  The entry guard, after briefly asking us if we were Korean (No, we are not), allowed us to join the tour.  As with our previous Palace and Secret Garden guides, this guide had excellent English, and their personal portable speakers projected loudly enough to be heard in a large group, without it being excessively noisy.The temple grounds are large and very leafy, but there are few buildings here, compared with the palace complexes.  The buidlings, however, are on a grander scale.  Following the cultural revolution in China, these are also the world's oldest extant Confucian devotional sites.  The foci of the complex are the two large spirit falls, where Korean monarchs to pay homage to their illustrious ancestors back to the founders of their dynasty.  Housing is also found for the less illustrious monarchs.  Touchingly we are told that these less famous kings often did not have opportunity to shine socially, administratively, or martially, due to a short life or a short reign, yet their spirits are still respected all the same.  The spirits of the last of the Korean Joeson dynasty, still using the Palace complexes till the late 20th Centure, are also housed here.Traditional Korean music is performed on the 1st Sunday of the month, but we did not get an opportunity to see this on this occasion.Well worth a visit.", June 2013
239,4.0,Interesting Tour. Peaceful Place.,"You'll probably only visit Jongmyo Shrine if you buy the integrated palace ticketbook. It's the complete opposite of the other sights. Whereas the palaces are for the living. Jongmyo is for the deceased. As such, it turned out to be a much more interesting tour than I expected. Similar to the Secret Garden at Changdeokgung, you can only enter Jongmyo as part of the scheduled tours. I believe there is a limit to the number of people who can be in there at once.As a side note, the small park outside the entrance is worth strolling through. You'll find all sorts of older gentlemen playing Go (or Baduk as it is called in Korea) and Xiangqi (Chinese Chess). As a fan of board games (and Go in particular), I appreciated seeing this.", May 2013
240,4.0,Eerie,"Initially, I wondered why this place was declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  It was simple, ascetic and completely unassuming.  After taking the guided tour, however,  this place is truly inspiring.  The beauty of this place lay in its simplicity.  This site gave me a deeper understanding of how Korean culture respects the past.", May 2013
241,2.0,Dull,"I didn't take a tour here and maybe I should have.  This place is very stoic and uninspiring.  The park space is peaceful but not as nice as the palaces nearby.  Actually the best part of this shrine was outside, where hundreds of old men were sitting playing baduk.If you're able to watch the rituals honoring the deceased royal family members, however, this place could be quite culturally interesting.", May 2013
242,4.0,In True Honour of the Dead,"At Jongmyo, you will learn much about the Korean belief of filial piety and the extent they go through to honour their ancestors and royalty -  highly commendable in an age where most believe in ""each man for himself"" and ""living for today"".  Entrance is by guided tour only, probably due to the sanctity of the grounds, so do check out the times for the English, Chinese and Japanese tours.  If I recall correctly, Jongmyo is closed on Tuesdays.", April 2013
243,5.0,Amazing Korean history in an urban oasis,"Seoul is a major bustling city that still has gems of history tucked away.  The shrine houses wooden tablets from each of the Chosun kings.  The architecture is simple, with reds and greens, and the walk thru the complex is beautiful.  Take a guided tour (they have ones in English four times a day).", March 2013
244,5.0,Really enjoyed Jongmyo,"Like the palaces, the English tours here are limited, I went at 2pm, but I have no idea if they keep the same schedule each day.  Six days a week you can only enter with a tour and on Saturday it's open to the public.  The tour was fascinating.  Jongmyo is a shrine for deceased kings of the last dynasty of Korea.  Everything is very symbolic.  There were only six people in my tour group and we were the only group in the shrine, so it was a remarkable experience.  I wouldn't recommend this for kids, instead I think this is a perfect tour for adult history buffs.", March 2013
245,4.0,A quiet place in a busy city,"Jongmyo was a beautiful place to visit.  The shrine is surrounded by a great wooded park.  It was still snowing when I visited and it added to the atmosphere.Guided tours are available at various times of the day and you may not be able to enter the shrine without one, so check the times for the right language ahead of time.The guide was friendly, engaging and very funny at times.Definitely worth the visit.", February 2013
246,5.0,Even when the tour was in Korean,"We didn't have much time so we went with the Korean tour. It is a beautiful solemn place. In the dead winter, it was majestic.Our guide was kind enough to come to us and explain in a language we understand when she realised we aren't locals.Well worth it. What a gorgeous, serene place!", December 2012
247,5.0,Not usually one for tours...,"tours are required if you go anytime other than Saturday and I do suggest doing it. You find out a lot more than what the brochure tells you--and I usually skip tours because they take too long and I want to see everything!The shrine almost constantly expanded, which makes the symmetry quite impressive.", December 2012
248,4.0,Royal Shrine of the Joseon Dynasty,"What we see at Jongmyo Shrine today is largely from the early 17th century. However, as the very long ruling Joseon Dynasty lasted five centuries, the shrine required additional constructions to house the spirit tablets of the monarchs. The site is indeed rather austere and solomn. I enjoyed my visit here, but for someone that loves history, the site by its very nature is less engaging than Changdeokgung or the royal tombs.Unfortunately, when I visited in 2008, tours were not required and not regularly held. While I knew much of the history, I would have enjoyed a expert guide. As Jongmyo is just next door to Changdeokgung Palace, you can visit both world heritage sites and learn much about royal life in the Joseon dynasty.", March 2012
249,5.0,Earliest surviving royal ancestrian shrine,The Jongmyo Shrine is a great place to learn about Korean history and Joseon Dynasty. The Shrine can be only be entered with a tour (so check for the time before you go).  The tour was very educational and interesting. The shrine is still used today for ritual ceremonies. Awesome place to visit. It is also a world heritage site!, November 2012
250,4.0,"Nice tour, Interesting Confucian history","I'm a little embarrassed to admit I've lived in and around Seoul for a few years and never knew of this tourist spot.  I think it's a great visit and really enjoyed the Confucian history and traditions of the past Royal families.It's a UNESCO World Heritage site.   Visited in October'12 and went on the guided tour, but had to wait around for a while until one started, so check the times before you go.  Tour took about 90 minutesAlso, don't forget that all the main palaces and Jongmyo sell the package tickets for 10,000W, for entrance fees and including tours at the Secret Garden in Changdeokgung and Jongmyo (Changdeokgung + Secret Garden Tour is 8,000 by itself, so it's a good deal if you plan to see all or most of the sites)", October 2012
251,5.0,Solemn Confucian Shrine,"Unlike anything else you will see in Korea, this shrine provides an instructive insight into its history and culture. It is not as highly decorated as the palaces nearby, but that and the setting only adds to the solemn spiritual character of the shrine. You can only visit as part of the regularly scheduled tour groups as it continues to be a site for worship. The tour is informative and while you cannot see inside the individual shrines of the emperors, there is a life size model of what a shrine is like and how the Jongmyo Jerye ceremony is carried out. It is included in the combination ticket for the Seoul Palaces and the Secret Garden and that ticket does outline when the tours are conducted in various languages.", September 2012
252,3.0,Nice historical site - tour is neccesary to get value,"This was a nice place to visit and the culture is significant. However, without a tour, this area would be very difficult to get value and interest out of but with a tour, it takes too long. That said, the tour guide we had was very very good.", September 2012
253,5.0,Incredible historical site,"While the palaces have been destroyed and reconstructed, this original shrine has been preserved and houses the remains of members of the Korean royal family extending over 500 years.  English tour was superb for learning about the relevant history and ritual practices.  The simple dignity of the shrine buildings is highly memorable.", July 2012
254,5.0,Amazing place to visit and learn about the Korean tradition,"I would highly recommend a guided tour for this place.  Definitely learnt alot about the Korean culture and how the Korean royalties went about their ceremonies from the guide.  Amazing location, situated within a forested area.", June 2012
255,5.0,Great place to exercise,Seoul is short of green spaces so even places with memorial tablets are used for exercising by locals.  Should be visited in conjuction with Changgyeongung.  The main shrine is a huge wooden building and is very impressive., August 2011
256,5.0,JOngmyo Shrine,"One of the most places I enjoyed in Seoul is my visit to Jongmyo Shrine.  It helped that one needs a guide to be able to enter the revered shrine to be able to fully understand the meaning of the places within the shrine complex.  The guided tour we had was in Japanese , but being non-Nihongo speaking , the guide we had was kind enough to have some of the audio-visual presentation in english , how kind of the guide. Walking along the quiet snow covered paths was a total departure from the busy Jongmyo street outside.   The main Shrine building reminded me of the SAnjusangendo in Kyoto , and was delighted to be informed that the main Shrine building is the second longest wooden structure in the world after The Sanjusangendo. Definitely a place to visit in Seoul !   The guides are not only knowledgeable but accomodating !", December 2010
257,3.0,Go on a Saturday,"The shrine is a modest display of where past Kings and Queens have been laid to rest amongst a lovely park-like setting. I visited the area last year and was not required to join a tour group, but they were available.After visiting the shrine yesterday the rules have changed. Entrance is only permitted with guided tours in various languages and there is no wandering around at a leisurely pace except on Saturdays. Last year I spent an hour enjoying a peacful and relaxing visit, free to move about the area. Yesterday I arrived at 16:10. The last tour in English was at 16:00, so I had to enter the shrine as part of the tour in Korean. I was lucky in that there was a Korean man who had immigrated to Los Angeles some 10 years ago, so he was kind enough to provide some translation. The problem with the tour was that we visited four main areas, stood in front of the placard for 15 minutes at each spot, and as we moved on if one of us lagged behind to take a quick picture we were quickly told to move along to the next spot.Even if I would have had the English version I would not have liked this required style of visiting the shrine, and would suggest to those that share a similar view to take my advice and go on a Saturday when you are not required to join a tour", June 2011
