0,5.0,Wonderful forest park. Not necessarily to come for tourists.,"Really nice park in southern Gangnam-gu District. it's huge and the forest is amazing. But, tourists don't need to come here because this is quite away from most touristic sites. - Many tall trees create shades and it's good to avoid heat in summer. - There are surrounding roads", June 2019
