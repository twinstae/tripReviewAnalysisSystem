3,2.0,Not worth the hype,"Yes this is a fancy area, where locals shop, but sales assistants are just rude or don't offer you any service. It's a stark contrast to shopping in Myeondong, and after visiting Garosu-gil, I actually prefer it.  Even a restaurant we had dinner at a couple of streets back from the main strip gawked at us.", December 2019
4,4.0,Hip area,"Garuso-gil is a hip area frequented by locals. Lots of restaurants, cafes and shops. But the usual franchises or big chains of food and fashion but very boutique style, quite unique in its style. This is not your typical tourist spot but a genuine place where locals go to shop and socialize. It has a nice vibe to it and great to stroll through in afternoon and evening. Subway stop is nearby, easy to go there with public transport. Parking not that easy as limited.", April 2019
5,5.0,AMAZING boutique shopping!,"If you are interested in boutique, independent-designer shopping - this street is a must visit. I spent an entire afternoon here and could easily have gone for longer. Lots of cute primarily clothing and jewelry boutiques, lots of pop-up jewelry stands on the street. Also make sure you pop into all the side streets as well - Garosu-gil is the main thoroughfare, but there are a lot of shops and cafes as well on the side streets all the way down the block.

15,2.0,Only good for restaurants...,"This place is only good for restaurant options. The hype for the brand name that I do not even know of is not worth it.

16,2.0,Used to be much better...,"This area used to be a trendy area with a lot of nice cafes, restaurants, and boutique shops. However, in the recent years has seen a huge number of big brands coming in and made the whole area a.... meh... not interesting any more.", August 2018

28,4.0,Garosugil Glam,"This is one place that draws me more than Myeongdong for its more glitzy image and less congested street. Although the shops here are more upmarket, this street sprouts into narrower alleyways that lead you to myriads of cafes that offer a tantalising array of cakes and lattes. Four years ago i had stumbled upon this tiny but quaint cafe called the Banana cafe which serves cakes in a flowerpot and lattes topped with pink cotton candy. If you love skin care then you must visit the Skin Food Cafe after shopping for its products and the Dr Jart flagship store that flaunts its state-of-the-art deco to lure you to buy its array of products that promise to transform your face into a flawless complexion. That i can vouch for after I bought it’s line of Ceremide masks that uses nano technology!", November 2017

47,5.0,Great place to walk around and discovery,, June 2017
48,5.0,Neighborhood much larger than Dosan-Daero 13-gil!!,"We stayed in this neighborhood as a base for exploring the rest of Seoul. Advantages are that there are numerous small streets on either side of Dosan-Daero 13-gil to explore filled with boutique cafes, restaurants, bars, karaoke, and shops. Although Dosan-Daero 13-gil has lots of western name brand stores, the streets to either side seem to mostly have one-offs that are currently under-represented on trip advisor. There are very few western tourists on these side streets but it seems very popular with local 20- and 30-somethings. Restaurants range across Korean, Japanese, French, Italian, Mexican, Indian, Thai, Vietnamese. Especially enjoyable for walking around in the early evenings when it is cooler and the shops are still open (generally until 9 or 10pm). A little harder to find restaurants for breakfast before 10am, though there are some. Arrive using the Sinsa metro station, take exit 8, and then turn down any of the streets to the left to access the area.", June 2017
49,5.0,Worth going,"10mins walk from MRT station. I personally quite like the environment. Very nice street with mixture of boutiques, cafes and restaurants. I went there twice during the trip.", June 2017

54,3.0,Good for shopping; not as vibrant as Myeongdong,"We aren't big shoppers and were going more for the people watching and to see another part of Seoul.  We had just been in Myeongdong, which I found to be far more vibrant.  Garosu-gil had more American brands (Tommy Hilfiger, Polo, etc.), so wasn't as interesting for us.  Again, if you're just going for people watching & the scene, I would skip this and stay in Myeongdong.", May 2017
55,4.0,Come here to find some designer clothes,"Short shopping street, come here to find some designer clothes. It is a kind of boulevard located not far from the metro station, full of interesting shops (small) with designer clothes. Several cafes are located here also so if you are not interested to buy anything just sit on the terrace with your espresso and watch Korean chicky-micky hipsters ;-))", May 2017
56,4.0,"Lovely, especially for cafe hopping!","The place is lined up with cafes and independent fashion brands, along with some branded shops like Gentle Monster. I would recommend this place to those who want a more chill day in Seoul. The district is not very crowded (since it's more high-end) so it is a good place to hang at when you want to take a breather from Myeongdong or Hongdae.", May 2017
57,2.0,Expensive shopping area,"Quaint shopping area but aside from some nice restaurants, the clothing stores are all the same in every mall and shopping district you visit. There are a lot of the same Uniqlo, Zara, H&Ms etc everywhere and lack of local fashions or works. This area is for people with money, as is all the areas around Apjujeong district. Myeongdong has more variety but it's lower quality.", May 2017
58,5.0,Upmarket shopping area with lot of interesting coffee houses,I was there with a few of my friends. We visiting the trendy shops - some famous brands such as Gentle Monster. This place is more like a museum than a shop selling glasses. You have other cute unique boutiques selling local brands. I adore the coffee shops there - big and great for people watching., May 2017
59,4.0,charming district with trendy people,, April 2017
60,4.0,Good place for people watching!,We visited on a Sunday afternoon. The street is an upmarket shopping area with nice coffee shops or chilling our or people watching. It was fun to stroll down the street. There is a Line shop with Cafe.  Coffeesmith also looks very popular and a place to be seen.  Osulloc was good for green tea desserts.  Lots of designer local and foreign shops., April 2017
61,5.0,Really liked it,"I went here twice because I liked it so much. They have amazing cafes and nice clothes shops (Mango, Hollister etc). I went on a sunday afternoon and I think it was a good time, because everyone sat outside at a cafe. Don't go in the morning as shops and cafes might still be closed. I would come back here.", April 2017
62,4.0,Cute,We got lost in Gangnam and ended up in this beautiful place. But it was too quiet and was not as fun as Myeongdong., April 2017
63,4.0,Fashionable and pleasant,"I went there on a Monday morning via subway. The ride was pleasant and not packed as I expected it to be as it was 9am at the time. People are definitely dressed a lot more trendy and fashionable here. Had a latte (excellent!) at Coffeesmith (left side of garosu-gil as you turn in and walk a few metres) before I strolled the street as most shops only open at 10:30 or 11am. I must say wi-fi was excellent in that area as I could connect to free wifi as I walked along the street. Tip : Signal is exceptionally strong in front of Sulbing (dessert shop not far from Coffeesmith) and across the street from it. The street has individual shops selling fashionable/trendy clothing & shoes of western and local labels, cosmetics, unique jewellery pieces and plenty of cafes and restaurants.", March 2017

69,4.0,Hip Street,"I always visit Garosu-gil when in Seoul but it's more on the higher end of shopping and dining. The shops are a bit pricier and dining can add up too depending on where you go. They do have cute shops so you'll see a lot of tourists and young crowds hanging out in this area. If you are looking for something more cultural, then I wouldn't really waste too much time here.", April 2016
70,3.0,Nothing special,, January 2017
71,3.0,Just a street,Another overhyped area called a tourist attraction for a reason that's beyond me. Shops for luxury brands or just simply local ones that's been gentrified. Cafes and restaurants here and there. There's really nothing outstanding here., February 2016

80,4.0,Nice neighborhood in Seoul.,"This area of Seoul is very easy going,has lots of places where you can buy many things in affordable prices.Very crowded on weekends, but still you can walk around with ease.Better to go after lunch or at the end of the afternoon.", September 2016
81,4.0,Welcome to the glitz and glamour of South Korea!,"On the one hand, Garosu-gil ""Green Street"" is basically a collection of over-priced restaurants and coffee shops.  On the other hand, if you want to see how the young, rich, and beautiful of Korea spend their afternoons this is the place to go.  Definitely worth visiting for at least 30 minutes before going elsewhere.", October 2016
82,5.0,Trendy slow walk,"Despite some of the other reviews, this is a great area to walk around and slowly drink your cup of coffee.  Enjoy the people watching of this ever-so-trendy neighborhood.  Take in a bite to eat if you have a chance.  Yes, the shops are expensive but it's all about the experience.  If time permits, this area is in close proximity of Hangang Park.  With your second cup of coffee, take a walk over to the river.", October 2016

95,5.0,The Beverly Hills of Gangnam,"During the Spring and some summer days, this is probably the closest you'll ever get to feeling like you are in California while traveling in Korea. Garosu-gil translates to ""street of trees"" or something like that. Boutique stores, coffee shops, and restaurants are situated on both sides of the street. I would even recommend going off the beaten path and exploring the side streets. There you will find other places which may tickle your fancy. During weekends expect large crowds.  If you stop in a coffee shop, don't be surprised if the person sitting beside you is famous. Garosu-gil is notorious to see and be seen.", July 2016

102,4.0,Shopping and unique cafes.,"There's a lot of shopping to do in this area. If you're not looking to do some shopping, then let all the unique cafes attract you.

116,3.0,lost its charm,"Tons of cafes for you to sit and people watch or to relax. There are lots more international brands in the area now as compared to two years ago, some of the shops I remembered were no longer there. There is a stand alone 3CE store worth visiting but it was quiet when I went. Shops pricing is in the mid to high level tier.", April 2016
117,5.0,Best Place to Sip your Coffee and Shop,The road is very lively. I love the coffee shops here and also the high quality stores. Would definitely come back again to enjoy the higher class street in Seoul., April 2016

120,3.0,Not as charming as expected,"Garosu-gil is beautiful with gingko tree lined streets, upscale urban shopping and too many adorable cafes to count. Think, Soho in NYC.  Its got a European feel and I guess that what I didn't love about it - lacks Korean charm.  Feels like it could be any upscale shopping area in a large city.  Its almost like they are trying too hard NOT to be Korean.  But, the cafes are lovely with emphasis on COFFEE and DESSERTS (Korea is not a tea culture), everyone speaks English fairly well and you can find lots of ""western"" restaurants here - especially pasta and tacos.  A nice stop but I ended up taking subway all the way back to Ssamjil-gil in Insadong where I found WAY more unique things to buy.", April 2016
121,2.0,Has lost its charm over the years,"Like someone else on here said, this area has completely lost its charm. When I visited a few years ago, it was full of independent cafes and very interesting shops to look at. The area also had a very cosy, hippie vibe. You could wander around the side alleys and there was always something interesting to see/buy. I was looking forward to doing that again this time around – but nope. Now all of that is gone and a lot of these unique shops have all been replaced by huge retail/international brands and a lot of cafes have moved to quieter, out-of-the-way places. I was looking around for this lovely café (Bloom and Goute) only to find that they have moved to a really odd area in some alley and had closed down!! Lots of shops have suffered the same fate. There’s also a distinct pretentious and snobby feel to the area, especially coupled with the somewhat stylish people who go there and have coffee and just sit around wanting to be seen. Interestingly, lots of girls in face masks – more than anywhere else I’ve visited in Seoul, possibly just out from one of the many plastic surgery clinics in the area. Almost everything here is overpriced, from the food to the coffee to the clothes and accessories. If you are looking to experience the Real Seoul, just skip this place and go somewhere else. I don’t think it offers much for the casual traveller looking to experience something about the local culture.", April 2016

124,1.0,Boring and uninspiring,"Just a street with your standard shops. Nothing special and no different from what you can get from an airport lounge. Cafes and restaurants are over priced as it is a ""classy"" neighborhood. This really is a boring place", March 2016
125,2.0,No longer worth visiting,"This used to be a great cozy street with local designers and boutiques, but now is just a mainstream shopping lane with Starbucks, Nescafe, Forever 21 and other brands you find in any mall in any city. Granted, there are still a few authentic boutiques left, but most have been chased away by exorbitant rental rates and chased into the smaller alleys off the main street. Boring, but if you go stay off the main street and venture into the alleys.", November 2015

Everything is so trendy at Garosu-gil and people spotted here dress really well! It's like Apgujeong and Cheongdamdong, but not as high end. Lots of nice cafes are located here too.

145,2.0,Lost its charm,"I stayed in this area back in 2012 and loved its hipster charm and character then. Loved that the shops were unique and very local and that there were many small Korean restaurants. When I visited again this year though, there were more international brands and it looked and felt like any other high end street. It was also crowded and there were too many high end cars and too little parking areas. Very disappointing!", November 2015

149,4.0,Rows of interesting shops and cafes for the in crowd,"The crowd here is mostly younger, and it is the yuppie, more grown-up version of Hongdae/Sinchon. This is a popular date spot during fall, but I visited in the winter and it was still pretty, and had something for all my needs. Here, my husband bought a bag and wallet from a Japanese brand at a reasonable price, and there are many stylish selections among the shops, from casual streetwear to modern home decor. Highly recommend this for those who like the Hongdae/Sinchon area!", January 2015

162,3.0,a bit disappointing,"I planned Garosu-gil into my itinerary but I felt that it was overrated upon reaching there at about 4pm. We went into a cafe for coffee and cakes. By the time we were done , the sky was already dark and the whole street looked beautiful just like those in european countries. would recommend that others visit it at night rather in the day time.", November 2014
163,5.0,Lovely shopping street with wide variety,"Garosu-gil is the tree lined avenue of many a korean drama - relatively narrow and rather pleasant to walk along. I found the shops here to offer a wider variety compared to myeondong, and there were no (or not many) repetitions of brands . in fact most of the shops seem to be those hip/unique ones where there is only one flagship.  Quality was much better than myeongdong and in fact, prices were reasonable. in myeongdong they inflate the prices expecting you to bargain. in garosu-gil all the goods are fixed priced - more suited to my shopping style. Sizes tended to go up to UK12. would recommended to anyone for a stress free shopping day. there's a famous shop along this street which sold a steamboat made of fish and fish entrails.. all i can say is, i tried it and survived, but would not patronize again - however it was full of koreans, no english menu, definitely an authentic korean famous shop.", September 2014

165,2.0,Not of my interest,"I went to Garosugil just out of curiosity but I did not enjoy being there at all. There are a lot of cafes and restaurant around and maybe some attraction like the Line Cafe but it just doesn't attract me. For someone who likes shopping, they might enjoy garosugil a lot but I don't really like shopping so it's not that fun for me", June 2015
166,4.0,Some special street,, May 2015
167,3.0,You'd better like shopping or drinking coffee,"Garosugil is the spot in Seoul for shopping, as the street features loads of clothing, accessories and cosmetics shops. Shops are very trendy, yet cheaper that what you could find a couple of blocks East in Apgujeong or Cheongdam. The coffee shop scene, vibrant throughout the city, is even better here. So, if you like high-street fashion and fancy coffee shop drinks, this is the place. however, if you're just looking for ""regular"" clothing, there maybe more options in Myeongdong, or in super malls such as the COEX or the Lotte World Mall. The street is indeed fairly short (a speed-walker could probably go from one end to the other in 15 minutes), and the side streets are not so numerous or bustling - yet, since garosugil has grown a lot recently). The quality of stores might be top notch, but there aren't quite as much as in other areas in Seoul. The dining scene is actually a bit below expectations, especially if you compare with Hongdae, Itaewon or even Myeongdong. Finally, besides the very Garosugil street, there is little else to do in the Northwestern part of Gangnam, so it does feel a bit secluded from other interested places.", April 2015
168,4.0,Shopping & Desserts!,"Adorable, hip shopping area in Seoul.  Loads of cool shops and boutiques including a number of chain stores.  The dessert cafes are a must for a delicious stop.  My husband I stopped at ""La Eskimo"" for some other-worldy cake and iced coffee.  It's definitely the perfect way to relax after a nice walk through these beautiful streets!", April 2015
169,5.0,Trendy shopping,Easily reachable via subway exit 8. There are tons of small trendy shops on the side streets. Tons of eateries and trendy clothing stores.

176,5.0,One of the best places to shoot a picture in Seoul,"Before starting to make a travel around the world, I used to live around Garosu-gil. Now is the time you should go see and stroll along the road because there's a lot of fallen leaves with yellow-tinted street lamps and beautiful signboard waiting to be seen- get along the road till you get to Gosu-buji (Han-river Park) and enjoy the park along the river. I lived there for a long time, so my tip is you must see this street when snow has fallen. Couldn't be better! You'd better bring your state-of-the-art camera with you; if you don't have it, you should bring your smart phone. Take a picture and you can get a once-in-a-lifetime picture. Believe me; you will never regret. I myself had taken a lot of good pictures in this street.", January 2014

Keep an eye for many outlets with great discounts on some of the korean designs and even designer items. There are many cafes, though more ""western"" cuisine than korean. However, there's a great fried chicken place called Hansu Chicken, which is after Forever 21, opposite King Kong Steakhouse. Only opens after 5 pm but if u can grab a couple of beers, and a plate of fried chicken, it's simply delish!!", September 2014

181,3.0,Upscale Trendy Neighbourhood,Walked along the main street during day time for some interesting Korean designer boutiques. Things here are generally more expensive but they are of higher quality. There are also some shops which caters to the more eccentric fashionista. Walk over to inner streets and you will discover some hidden gems too. Many cafes around too and Mango Six is recommended for a short tea time. A local told me this place is more interesting and happening at night on a weekend. I like this place as it's not overly crowded and much more of a joy to walk around., July 2014

184,5.0,Great Restaurants and Shopping,"I visited a few times, but it's quite interesting. There are so many great restaurants in this area. High end food at mid price on competition. Even restaurants and coffee shops are featured and published in life style magazins like Monocles and Condes Nast. Use the mobile apps to look for venues. Restaurants my friends took were all in weird corners but fully occupied and booked most of time, just like all locals know while tourists like me can't think of going. All worth a visit. There seems more tourists than fancy local girls nowadays, but there are many fancy local designers selling niche stuff like alligator handbags at US$600-700 and cute fashionable t-shirts at US$20-30. Take 3 hours for food and shopping. Maybe a bit longer in case you'd like to sit in the cafe to check out gorgeous local people.", April 2014
185,3.0,Too commercial but yet with quite a lot of local designer shop,"It's not very busy & hanging around there for coffee & some local designer shop is quite leisure, easily kill a couple of hours. But not much excitement, products are commercial rather creative", May 2014
186,4.0,"Great food, shopping and cafe's","This is a great area for an afternoon with the girls or for a quick shopping trip with your family. There are a lot of cafes and unique shops with nice and decently priced clothing. One difficult thing is that there is often only 1 or 2 of each piece and if you are not super thin as many Koreans are, you will have a hard time finding clothes so stick to shoes or grab a drink and people watch.", April 2014
187,5.0,Great food and shopping,"European inspired street Garosu-gil has many upscale boutiques to shop at and street vendors. Kind of reminds me of Newbury Street in Boston.
