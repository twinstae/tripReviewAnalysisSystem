0,3.0,This place is amazing for some and terrible for others,"I stayed in Itaewon at the Hamilton Hotel for two weeks and have really mixed opinions on it. I'll separate it to make more sense.

6,4.0,Good Old ....Itaewon !?!?,"Perhaps it just me.  Perhaps  today was a Debbie downer in the area.  Perhaps the day of the week wasn't right.  Perhaps the coin showed Heads instead of tails.   Or ... really... perhaps gentrification is starting to set in.   It appears to be more of the last one.   Went to Itaewon for the first time in 18mths today, and whilst its still a great place, I felt something was a little off about it.   Refurbishment is starting to happen, there appear to be more empty shops, Bigger name franchises seem to be occupying more shop space, and with the move of USFK Headquarters to Pyongtaek, the foreign pedestrian traffic has significantly dropped.   I understand that the Seoul Metropolitan government has goals for the area.   Hopefully they have a positive impact on the area as Itaewon is a great place to go.   I guess we will have to wait and see.", October 2019

The streets at night are vibey and with a lot more variety of ethnicity which I loved because my home town I see different kinds of people and after 1 week of seeing one kind of race it was REALLY so nice to see other kinds of ethnicities I’m used to seeing daily.

17,3.0,Holiday ,"We visited this place at night. This area is for the young. Bars, clubs, restaurants,Karaoke and dance venues. The music is deafening and the crowds of young people in the back alleys are beyond belief. Not much different to other cities of the world to areas that attract young people. Go to observe if you are a bit long in the tooth or partake if you are young.", June 2019
18,2.0,Unremarkable.,"Itaewon does have lively nightlife going for it, but it's not really distinguishable from any other western downtown. The food is fine, and pricey and underwhelming compared other parts of Seoul. During the day, it's fairly slow and skippable. Go if you want to get wasted, wade through shifty people and party late, but don't expect cultural fulfillment or a unique experience.", June 2019
19,4.0,Take the back alleys,The best restaurants and pubs are in the back alleys behind the Hamilton hotel.  Our favorite was a seafood restaurant named Boiling Shrimp Crab on the third floor.  Excellent cajun style seafood., May 2019
20,2.0,Fly for the Big Guy,"Itaewon has some great eats and would be the most popular place with foreigners. A massive US Military base is there so this is one of the only places to go in Korea for a big guy in search of clothes that fit. (T-Shirts, Tank Tops, Jeans etc.) There are a lot of bars and clubs and the seedier side of life is prevalent here. Not Somewhere for a first timer young lady foreigner on her own to go (unless you are into that).

23,3.0,I think it was better...,"...back in the day.  That day would be when it was mostly a destination for American GIs.  I guess Itaewon is now kind of an international area with lots overpriced foreign restaurants.  Seems to have a large Middle Eastern presence.   I walked around a bit reminiscing about the good ole days when I was a young GI back in 80s.  Now, I don’t fit.  I think young expatriates like it here, and there are some name brand stores that peaked my interest.", February 2019
24,5.0,International food galore!,It's an international food galore! Its a very hilly area to stroll but really worth the climb. Lots of halal restaurant too. Nice experience overall., December 2018
25,2.0,Mosque and halal food,"I went to Itaewon because many Malaysian travellers recommended this place for the mosque and halal food and because I wanted to try Plant Cafe. The mosque was great - it's located uphill and you can get a view of Seoul from there. However, Itaewon feels and look tacky. Definitely not the best part of Seoul. Not worth visiting again in future, except if I want to eat at Plant Cafe again.", January 2019

38,3.0,"While it has plenty of bars opened at night, halal food are easy to find too","This area has more foreigners than other part of Seoul does. Many are selling halal food such us Middle Eastern, Indonesian, or Malay food, but there is also one or two restaurant selling halal Korean food (I recommend you going to Eid for halal bulgogi). There are also some halal stores selling halal food but don't expect them to be Korean brand - they are all imported so the price may be higher. Basically Itaewon is good for muslim who are living in Seoul but still needs to perform halal living while nonmuslim can spend night out at bars and restaurants. For tourism, the only thing I can recommend is halal Korean restaurant and the great mosque (even it's not really nice place to visit)", June 2018

There are many interesting shops and once we had some beer at an independent brewery and another time we had ice cream in a Turkish cafe. This time when we returned at midday it seemed quiet and lifeless. I liked the greetings in different languages on the pavements but there wasn't much else to enjoy. Perhaps best visiting at night for a lively vibe but Hongdae, Insadong and Myeongdong might be more interesting.", June 2018

They served us a bottle of Australian wine (which is usally an average wine) and charged us 149 US $! After we asked Korean people sitting next to us to translate the menu, we realized that the manager (who is standing in front of the bar) is lying about the prices. With complain from us, he lowered the price on 80 US $, which was still not realistic and too high.", May 2018

True indeed, you can easily spot halal kebabs everywhere from The Sultan Kebabs up to any other small shops selling the same thing. We did have our lunch in one of the kebabs diner. Excellent kebabs, delicious & affordable. We also got to see lots of Malaysians there, maybe because there was a nearby mosque there. Nothing much to see other than that.

72,5.0,Great Seoul nightlife at reasonable prices........,"I've been coming to Seoul for well over ten years and can remember Itaewon as a rather sleazy area, frequented mainly by GI's given it's proximity to the US Army base at that time. Since the Americans moved out of the city, the area has seen massive development and now hosts a wide choice of bars and restaurants in the area around the Hamilton Hotel on Itaewon itself, and the pedestrian road behind. Most bars are reasonably priced, offering a more affordable option outside of the main tourist hotels. It is the place in Seoul to spend an evening - well worth a visit !", October 2017

The one exception is that this is a unique place. The foreigners here will outnumber Koreans. There are some good ethnic restaurants. Ok...I guess if you must, you can visit this unique place to see where you used to go for all things foreign.

90,4.0,Tourists as far as the eye can see,"Itaewon is sometimes known as the city where there are more tourists and foreigners than actual Koreans, and I think it's because this place had a military base in the past (Not sure if it's still around now!). If you want to experience the night life in Seoul, this is probably the best place to be. From K-beauty brands to foreign goods (like Nike and Adidas), this place has got it all. There are also plenty of drinking places, pubs, and hole-in-the-wall restaurants that cater to every foreigner's tastes. I saw a Halal Guys, a Turkish delight dessert cafe, and steakhouses to name a few.

It reminded of a small town in east coast USA. We strolled on the main drag, and all the side alley in between... the shops, restaurant and cafes. It was like an international market in one place; an array of restaurants like Thai, Vietnamese, French, Italian, Middle Eastern, Japanese, Chinese, Philippines, American Diner to name a few.

Also safe for female solo travelers - I went there alone. Lots of families and couples are around to shop.

I had heard that it was a fun, eclectic, international area, but I found it to be overly rowdy and much less interesting than other districts. As an American, I was embarrassed by the loud (even shouting!) U.S. tourists on the long side streets and unimpressed by the restaurant offerings. It seemed to attract people who wanted the experience of Seoul, but didn't want to actually go out and explore the city. Lots of tacky older couples and older teenagers.

182,4.0,Lively international area of Seoul.,"Itaewon seems to be a bit touristy and maybe I ordinarily wouldn't like it but we visited it on the day of vibrant festivities. Itaewon Global Village Festival really reflects the spirit of this place. Hamilton hotel's unattractive architecture does not seem to matter- it is undeniably the anchor of this neighborhood. Itaewon is about shopping, possibly partying and eating familiar things. At the entrance to the neighborhood there is a map of the area helpful in planning your exploration.

Really The average Korean looked down on this place. But over the last few decades the place has transformed into a trendy spot filled with great restaurants and pubs frequented by locals and expats alike. The area behind the Hamilton Hotel is filled with fun pums and restaurants that ared shared between all. The night life here is vibrant and fun. Just people watching while you grab a cold one is a blast. Now if you cross the other side of the street there are still some seedy places, particularly on the hill behind the fire station. Juicy bars still remain as do transgender bars which demonstrate the changing times in Korea. One can stll shop for cheap stuff along the main drag of Itaewon-ro and its side alleys if that is your thing, but I would recommend the trendy side of the street mentioned above.

Itaewon is a nice district to hang out in now and then to get your western food cravings taken care of before heading back to wherever else in Korea you're going or living. I like it for its western feel, but it definitely can feel like a bubble for foreigners in the mid south of Seoul. Then again, so can Hongdae, the university district. Anyplace where young Koreans are attracted to are more likely to feel this way.
