It's a small free museum on 3 levels with excellent displays and commentary", September 2019
1,5.0,Small but excellent museum.  And free!,No reason to get a guide for this museum.  Short walk from the Dongdaemun Gate so take the metro (or taxi) and do it yourself and if you have the time (or energy) walk a bit of the wall itself.  Museum has plenty in English and really explains the history of the city (and the wall of course).  Great photo ops from the wall itself., September 2019
2,5.0,Great museum!,"Exhibits had excellent English descriptions. Well presented. Enjoyed learning about the different gates and how the wall evolved over the years. Very near the East gate, so makes for a good visit for both. After visiting museum, you can exit onto the wall and walk up it for an excellent city view.", September 2019
3,4.0,Historical and Cultural significance of Hanyangdoseong-FREE,"While walking through the Dongdaemun City Park I accidentally came across the Seoul City Wall Museum. Excellent staff, answer questions and provide brochures in English.The museum has both a permanent exhibit and a special exhibit hall.  The day I was there the special exhibit was Changuimun in Jeong Seon's paintings.  Jeong Seon was a prominant painter in Joseon.  The paintings help you see what the Changuimun looked liked during the Joseon dynasty.My personal favorite was on the 3rd floor: The wall construction vide.", September 2019
4,5.0,History hidden in plain sight – visiting the Seoul City Wall Museum,"Located right next to the subway station at Dongdaemun, the museum and city wall don’t immediately stand out against the Seoul’s modern backdrop of cafés and commerce. However after climbing up one of Seoul’s trademark killer slopes, the Doseong Museum holds a treasure trove of historical information and objects, which show the incredibly rapid foundation and evolution of the city as seen through its surrounding wall. Built to demarcate the city of Seoul (at first named Hanyang) from the surrounding countryside, a local guide first showed us around the three floors of the City Wall Museum itself, which includes a range of interactive exhibits showing how the wall was built and rebuilt by different rulers over the years, before restoration began at the end of the twentieth century.Having had an overview of the construction of the wall, our guide took us out to trek up the wall to Namsan, stopping at points as we went along to point out how Seoul had expanded beyond the original limits of the city and showing us how the different brickwork that you could see on the wall corresponded to different eras of Korean history. Since 90% of the wall has been rebuilt, our guide told us it would take over ten hours to walk all the way around, so we only completed about an hour of the hike, which took us through some beautiful parts of the city, with really good views of the sprawl of the city as well as of the mountains which surround it.As someone who missed this tourist spot the first-time round, I would say this is a must-visit for any tourist coming to Korea and interested in Korean history. As long as the weather is good, visiting the museum and the wall is a great way to get in some exercise, see some amazing scenery and learn more about the transformation of the city.

The wall linked with 4 mountains (Bugaksan, Naksan, Mongmyeoksan, and Inwangsan), which will enrich the visitor's eyes with green and lots of lovely views. The lovely wall arts and excitement of mountain hiking will make you more energetic during the visit.Thanks a lot, #FundaydayKoreannetworks network to arrange such a beautiful program for international visitors and give me the opportunity to join with lots of lovely people.

6,5.0,Excellent free city museum,"A short walk away from Heunginjimun Gate in Dongdaemun is the very interesting free City Wall Museum.  The museum is housed in a beautifully designed modern building and exhibits are spread out over three levels.  The permanent collections can be found on the first and third floor, on the second was a temporary exhibition which we skipped due to time.  We found all the exhibits thoroughly interesting, the story of the wall, how the location was chosen, construction process and how the wall needed to  change as the city expanded and modernised to incorporate a tramway. The use of multi-media made our visit 45 minute visit thoroughly enjoyable: 3D relief models with special LED lighting, videos, photographs, artifacts. The animated videos were wonderful to watch giving the viewer a good impression of the history and construction of the wall, there was plenty to read in English and if not the exhibits spoke for themselves. It was a pleasure to visit this museum which was very peaceful with few visitors, my kind of museum.  We exited the building on the third floor which took us immediately out to the wall and we hiked up to Naksan Park and beyond.", April 2018
7,3.0,Nice INTRO Museum for the Seoul City Wall!,"If you are already planning to start at Dongdaemun Gate and walk the Seoul City Wall, this is a nice way to learn some history and build context.  I enjoyed learning that during each time period, different wall construction was used.  I looked for this as I explored the wall.  I also enjoyed seeing the small statues that were on top of one of the gates.  In my Seoul City Wall video you can see both the different wall construction and figures.  Just search for Amy Moncure.", June 2018
8,4.0,a wonderful and free museum,This museum is off the beaten path and honestly I stumbled onto it as I was following the wall.It's a great museum that describes not only the construction of the wall as other museums do but the approach to managing and maintaining it.There are lots of interesting exhibits and artifacts. Sadly like most museums in Seoul there is not much material that has been translated to English so you read headlines and guess the rest., June 2018
9,4.0,History of Seoul,The museum is connected to the Seoul City Wall. While the museum is small it does provide a great deal of the life for the people of Seoul. There are 3 floors to this museum.

11,4.0,Free museum about Seoul's city wall,"Small museum over 3 floors which informs you on the history of the city wall. Details various construction methods over numerous rebuilds, reason for wall, etc. Free museum that is well done with both Korean and English descriptions.

13,4.0,Small and interesting,"Over 3 floors there is an entrance on the 3rd floor from near part of the wall (follow signs) and another door on the first floor at the building entrance. Helpful staff and a good map of the whole wall and the access points to walk it. Good information on the wall, how it is built and maintained by different dynasties.
