0,4.0,Huge,We didn't have to much time to explore but we saw what we wanted the most :-) We liked thisplace very much, February 2020
1,4.0,A place on which you can spend lots time,"I attended a conference at Coex center for several days. During the break and after meeting I walked around in the Coex center quite a few times. The most famous place in there is the Starfield Library. Many people went there to take photos with it, and many people read books there too - if you can read Korean. All the books except very few magazines are Korean. I browsed several U.S. magazines. It is a quiet and comfortable place to rest. There are many restaurants and most of them are very affordable by American standard. It is next to City Airport Terminal so it is very easy to access from airports by shuttle buses. In front of Coex center stands statue of Gangnam Style Hand, and Bongeunsa Temple is just cross the street.", October 2019
2,4.0,"10,000 steps a day - guaranteed.",, September 2019
3,4.0,Shopping Galore,"This place is HUUUUGE! It looks above ground, but the Real magic happens believe ground. I believe people must have disappeared and gotten lost there, it is the Seoul version of the Rome or Paris catacombs - but with shops and restaurants. Everything you would ever need and everything you dont need!", April 2019
