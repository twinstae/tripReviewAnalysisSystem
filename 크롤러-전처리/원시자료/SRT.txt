0,5.0,Easy peasy and oh so quiet ,"The good thing about SRT is that they are always on time, in the off chance they arenâ€™t the platform has digital readout a that let you know how far behind. The biggest delay Iâ€™ve ever seen is 3 minutes. The cars are clean and offer overhead storage for bags. It was so quiet....no one was talking which was pleasant but also a little weird. The one bad thing is that you have to have a Korean credit card to pay online. You Dan by same day tickets at the station.", September 2019

4,5.0,Easy peasy,"We just got onto the SRT with no prepurchasing of tickets for 6 pax. We departed Busan for Daegu. Tickets were 15 600 won for adults bought at the ticket counter of the train station (not the subway, leave the subway and go up the stairs. The train station is the huge structure ahead). Happy travels, happy New Year ðŸŽ†ðŸŽ‰", December 2018
