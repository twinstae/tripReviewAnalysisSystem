Whilst Hongik is grungy and organic, Ehwa has a feel of stateliness about it.  On top of the mound is the longstanding campus that's built by foreigners and it still proudly stands to these days, giving it a sense of tradition and history.  In actual fact, Ehwa University is one of the most elite female university in South Korea.  I truly wouldn't know how students there can concentrate in their studies noting that there are throngs of tourists that are taking selfies and wandering aimlessly around the campus the whole time.  The key part of this University will be the Red Sea parting looking architecture designed by Dominic Perault.  From afar, you look as if you are climbing the stairs that are flanked on both sides by rising waves.  When you get closer, you start noticing that the rising waves happened to be window opening of university campus that's built in accordance with the gradient of the mount.  It's cleverly done.

The elevator is inside the glass building housing the shops!It was neat to walk around and see university students in another country. The surrounding area has well-priced clothing and make-up shops.
