Seeing Seoul from top, bathed in golden sun rays, it was really worthy went all the way to Namsan Tower against breezing wind winter. A cup of hot chocolate was enough to keep me warm", January 2020
1,5.0,N Tower,"If your in Seoul you should visit the N Tower. The view is very fantastic,  you can see the city lights on the top, its nice to visit during evening.  They also have restaurant there in case your hungry and you want to enjoy the view while eating.", April 2019
2,4.0,Fantastic View of the City,"The N Seoul Tower is relatively easy to get to by train/bus. You can take a special bus to the top of the hill or you can hike it up the hill which is a very good workout. Go to the tower in the evening as the view of the city is fantastic. There is also a couple of gift shops to purchase your souvenirs. A must see while in Seoul. Take the tram ride up to the elevator, at the base of the tower, if you’re not up to the hike.", February 2020

4,4.0,Amazing view at night,"The day we arrived in Seoul, after putting our luggage at the hotel, we straight away took a bus to Namsan Tower. I booked the ticket using Klook and scanned the ticket at the entrance. The view at night is amazing you can see the whole area. If you have strong legs, you can walk up the hill.", October 2019
5,4.0,Nice Scenic View,"Located in a relatively central location in Seoul,no direct metro but can easily navigate your way there by alighting at Dongguk University stn, exit 6 n go to bus stop near Uni bridge. Take bus 2 n 4 to reach. Tower located at Namsan Mountain whereby one can take many nice photos. Tower visit itself is rather optional as the mountain already provide a fantastic view of the city. Defo worth a visit.", February 2020
6,4.0,"Big hike, great views","I purchased the Skip the Line ticket, but for the time I actually went (during the day, middle of the week, January), I didn't need it (however, it seems like from other reviews, you may still want to consider it). I took the Hop On Hop Off Bus - Palace Route to get to the tower. It's still quite a hike up the hill, but the sun was out and the views of Seoul were really incredible. I feel very lucky that the weather cooperated and while there was some glare through the windows and a bit of haze, I think my photos came out okay and I had a good time just walking around the floor, looking at different points around the city. There is helpful signage with the distance of different cities from Seoul. There is a small gift shop where you can buy postcards and even mail them. There is a sit down restaurant, but I believe you need to have reservations. Once you get out of the tower, there are other restaurants and souvenir shops. I wish I would have taken the cable car, that sounds like it was fun.", January 2020
7,5.0,Another tallest tower done..yay!,I sure am a sucker for towers and tall buildings I donno why and Nseoul tower was one of the best..121 floors high I guess and the glass bottom and all the photo ops..we all had a good time!, December 2019

13,5.0,Worth the cost of admission!,, January 2020
14,5.0,Beautiful views with a Romantic feel,"Located on Namsan mountain in central Seoul, it's easy to get to. Just after dusk provides breathtaking views. You need to take the cable car up the plaza area. Here you will find lots of attraction like the ""love locks"" something similar to Paris, wishing pond, various observatory decks, food court, museum's and the entrance to the observatory tower itself which boasts of panoramic views of the city of Seoul. One of Seoul's must visit attractions.", December 2019
15,5.0,Amazing,"Namsan Tower is known for many things: the cable car ride, the nice trekking at Namsan Park, the great aerial view of the city, museums and café.  At a height of almost 240m, the tower has an onservatory deck that offers an amazing view of the city. The iconic letter “N” was the result of the remodeling of the tower in 2005. Since then, the place is known as N Seoul Tower, with beautiful bright lights at night.", January 2020
16,5.0,New year's Eve,My family and I vacationed in Seoul for New year's Eve. We stayed at the millenium Hilton in front of Seoul station. we didn't know what to do for New year's Eve countdown. So we decided to climb the mountain directly in front of the millenium Hilton. At The summit is Seoul tower. From which you can see the New year's Eve fireworks from down below. The temperature was about minus 8 degrees Celsius. We bundled up around 11 p.m. and started up. The hike was very lovely. As you hike up you can see a beautiful a 360 view of the city of Seoul at night. It's not a hard hike. And there are art installations along the way. Including a strange love heart lock it installation. Apparently you can buy love heart lockets and write a message and lock it around these fences and other art installations along the mountain. At the top of the mountain there are cafes and gift shops. You can purchase tickets to go in to Seoul tower. We did not do that. Instead We got some hot chocolate and coffees and celebrated 2020 watching the fireworks from down below. The fireworks were very small from our vantage point and not that impressive. but overall it was a beautiful hike and an absolutely fantastic way to ring in the New year. It started to snow along the way as well but that made it all the more romantic and special. My teenage daughter took many pictures. We walked around with our hot drinks looked around the gift shops and then made our way back down as we started to feel the chill. I highly recommend this hike. I could not have imagined a better New year's Eve . It was perfect, January 2020
17,5.0,Worth the trip!,"What a gorgeous view of Seoul at night! When we got on the bus to go to the tower, I didn’t realize that it was at the top of a hill/mountain so I was surprised that we didn’t just walk, but I was thankful as we made our way up the windy roads that walking wasn’t happening! It was definitely worth the trip and I loved the whole experience. Would definitely do it again next time I come to Seoul, but maybe during the day next time!", January 2020
18,4.0,Awesome view!,"The prices for the ticket were a bit expensive, considering the surrounding attractions are significantly cheaper. We enjoyed the view though, and the many opportunities to grab a souvenir. Would definitely come back during a different season to see how the view would look during spring or summer.", January 2020

20,4.0,great views,"great views at the city from above, but was a bit hard to walk up closer to the tower, the views outside were actually more picture worthy. Loved sweet post card mailing service- the best souvenir ever- sent a card from atop of the tower to my family across the world. Liked walking around different lower levels, lots of cool statues and giftshops, food places etc.", September 2019
21,4.0,Landmark In Seoul,It was opened to the public in 1980 and provided TV and radio broadcasting in Korea and also used for tourist purposes and on a nice day you get great views from the observation tower. Located on Namsan Mountain it stands 480 meters above sea level and visible from most parts of Seoul., November 2019
22,4.0,Great views - make sure you pick a clear day!,"We went up the tower the day after it rained, which meant the air was clear and we had absolutely stunning views all the way round, especially over far into the mountains to the north. I imagine that had we gone later in the week when the smog started to creep back in, the views could have been quite disappointing. It was also reasonably priced and the gift shop actually had some good quality items, which was a nice surprise! I have knocked a star off as the little cable car that takes you to the base of the tower from the bottom of the hill was not working on the day we went and we had to take the stairs - not an issue for us, but if you have mobility problems, you would have been stuck!", May 2019

27,5.0,Seoul Tower,highly recommend to take this trip during night hours so you can actually see the city lit up. I would highly recommend spend the extra money to skip the line do to how busy it is.

38,3.0,It’s a nice tower,"Probably outshined by Lotte Tower which of course is bigger and badder but the wait times and surrounding area at N Tower are much better. There is good food, a bar, lovelocks and a trippy colors room before you enter the tower elevator.", January 2020
39,3.0,Good,I didn't go to the actual tower but rode up to it and put a lock on the lock wall. If you can bring your own definetly do as they are overprised - and don't forget a pen as they have none for you to use - only to buy. The view was pleasant and the price was fine., August 2019
40,2.0,Mind the weather,"If you are planning to go to the observatory, mind the weather conditions as they do not have any notice about the visibility. They did not offer to give a refund or to make it valid for another day. Very disappointed", December 2019

42,4.0,Outstanding views - go at night,Overall excellent experience. Don’t try to drive there unless you know the way. Navi apps don’t quite work. The taxi took us on our second attempt. Long walk up to the tower but there is a gondola option. Lots of food and souvenir shopping options up there. We waited 40 minutes for our queue to go on up. It was t quite and large as I though once up there but the views were amazing. Go at night for the best experience. A lot of others scenic spots on the ground and trail., December 2019
43,5.0,Beautiful Night Scene for Kdrama Fans,"If you are a fan of Kdrama, the night scene at N Seoul Tower definitely did not disappoint. The cable car ride was pleasant and orderly.  There are multiple inexpensive dining options by the tower. The public space to view the night scene at the foot of the tower was huge so even on crowded days, it did not feel claustrophobic. It was a pleasant place to spend a nice evening.", December 2019
44,4.0,Short review on Seoul N Tower,A quintessential tourist stop in the outskirts of Seoul. We did not go up the tower. Just hung around the base area and took in the scenic beauty.

46,5.0,Winter visit,"Went during the day and Took a long walk up from Myeongdong, tiring as it's up slope. Ideal to walk from Shinsegae department store and take the slanted elevator up to the cable care point. View is wonderful from the top and super cold during winter. Some restaurant and shops, best for scenery viewing. So many love locks around.", December 2019

There is a place for the 'locks' where friends, lovers and family expressed themselves by placing a padlocks, phone covers there. Take care because the slope is quite steep getting up. Basically its good for photo taking.", December 2019

51,5.0,A Lovely walk in Autumn and experience the colours of dusk in N Seoul Tower,"Wonderful, Romantic and Memorable that's what we've experience visiting N Seoul Tower or Namsan Seoul Tower. In the chilly dusk of November in Seoul, we went here via Bus #3 in Chungmuro station exit 4. The ride took about 30 mins because it's the rush hour and many stops so if you would like a faster way to get here can take the Namsan Cable car or taxi or you could hike to the tower itself. Takes around 1,100 won one way and it is the last stop in its route. There are many tourists in the entrance and buses both public and tour buses and parked there so it tends to get busy. Indeed, it is one of the most visited attractions in Seoul. Standing high at 774 ft it is an observation and communications tower and the second highest in Seoul. It is my second time to visit this place but this time during the day. My first time in 2016 it was at night and we went on top of the observation deck inside the tower overlooking Seoul from Namsan Mountain where its located right at the heart of Seoul. The ticket costs around 11,000 KRW. This time around 2019 we didn't go inside but we visited the base of the tower which surrounded by the beautiful Namsan park and its wide array of trees that include Maple, Pine, Ginko, Cherry blossoms and many more. Since its fall the colors are full of Red, Yellow, Orange, White and Brown truly mesmerizing, eye catching, romantic and beautiful. We took a lot fo beautiful photos and videos before these blooming trees in the colours of Autumn. Up here you will have a panoramic view of Seoul - its skyscrapers, buildings, castles, villages and rivers. It is indeed a magical view for us. You don't even need to go up the observation deck. Another great feature we did is the Lock Padlocks where tourists and local couples put their padlocks as a key of their endearing love for each other. You could write your names and buy the key/padlock from the minimart inside N Seoul Tower. We indeed put our padlock in the midst of thousands of locks placed in this mountain. The Lock Padlocks also offer a great panoramic view of Seoul, the Tower and Namsan Park. We left just before night falls via bus and it was a short yet memorable visit for us. It is indeed of the best and beautiful destinations in Seoul so please do come visit when you arrive here in Seoul, Korea.", November 2019
52,4.0,Absolutely must visit,, August 2019
53,5.0,Who doesn't like being on top of the world?,"Set on a small mountain in the middle of Seoul, the tower has views that show the tourist just how big Seoul is, with satellite towns stretching aolong every valley from the cental mass of the city. The lift to the top is quite special. Walk up the mountan if you are able.", November 2019
54,5.0,Nice place to see the city from the top.,A great experience to visit N Seoul Tower. It's almost like KL tower of Malaysia. Nice surrounding embeince. To reach there the cable car ride was great., October 2019
55,3.0,View of Seoul city ,"Went on a hazy night, so the view and the photos taken were not fantastic. We bought Klook package which offered transport via Hyundai Starex van uphill plus the observatory deck tickets. And we took the cable car downhill which was a great experience.

57,5.0,Best view at night!,"I recommend going to the N Seoul Tower Observatory at night since you can see a beautiful view of Seoul~ There are a lot of places to eat and shop. As couples, you can ""seal"" your memories here through the Love Lock bridge (locks are sold in vending machines which is so cool!) The easiest way imo is taking a bus to any available station near you. Also, the comfort room in the observatory is something you shouldn't miss 😋", November 2019
58,3.0,360 degree view of Seoul,"You really do get a spectacular view of the whole city of Seoul most especially at night when all the lights are on.  It is breathtaking.  The staff directing us toward the elevator and the one who went with us inside was really cheerful and attentive.  The 3 stars is because when we went there in the evening, there were only a few staff that we could see, most of the time we didn't see any.  The ones at the information were not too helpful as well.  I was asking for help with the machine to scan the QR codes.  I had 5 e-tickets and was asked to input the numbers instead one by one , took me quite a while to finish and when I could not read the last one since it had very small prints, the guard took the paper from me and scanned the QR code in just a few minutes (if only they told me that was the easier way then I wouldn't have wasted my time inputting the numbers manually).  Other than that, my friends and I did manage to have a good time there.", November 2019
59,4.0,Beautiful,On my Third Day in Seoul I walked up Namsan Hill. Beautiful walk with all the tree turning red yellow and orange. On the 5th Day went up using the cable car. It is a must visit. Enjoy the view of Seoul from there. Only sour point was when i bought coffee from Twosome Place i was not allowed to drink in the Burger Restaurant where my daughters was having their Hotdog. Too rigid in my opinion., December 2019
60,5.0,high view of Seoul,"Another top option to include in your to do list is to explore Namsan tower..they say it is the geographical center of Seoul. The observatory have orderly queue and there are employees assisting every guest.. there’s even a photo activity w/ cgi effect background.. but best to arrive early if you are targeting to view the sunset on the tower, the best time to see expanse view beautiful of Seoul .", December 2019

72,4.0,Brilliant views - no need to pay to go higher,"We got off the hop on, hop off bus at this stop on a whim and had a brilliant visit here.  We spent a good two hours wandering around and taking pictures of the fantastic views over the city. We didn’t bother to get tickets to go up the upper tower as the views would only have been more distant. We did however take a return trip on the Namsan Cable Car and got some good views from that. A very worthwhile visit.  Unfortunately we weren't able to visit at night to see the skyline lit up but I'm sure it would have been brilliant.", June 2019

75,4.0,Iconic Namsan Tower,"I visit towers in every city I travel to, so Seoul was no different. However, it took a lot of effort to get up there. The easiest way is to take the metro to Myeongdong station, walk 10-15 minutes to the Namsan Oreumi elevator to get to the cable car station. Even once you get off the cable car, there are about 100+ stairs to climb. There are separate entry tickets for the cable car and the tower.

As in other places, such as the Tower Eiffel in France, you first travel to an intermediary platform about half of the height of the tower and then you take an elevator to the upper floor.

I was not able to get to the top of the tower because of the time limit, however, the view I did see was fabulous. The mountain is steep and it is best to walk up it slowly if you aren't used to walking up mountains.  Though I had no time to get to the top, I enjoyed the view I could see.  There are many tourists on this mountain and everybody is camera and selfie happy, so you may have to wait to take photos at different sites.  This was worth coming too, even if you cannot make it to the top.", October 2019

109,4.0,Must see place,"More than the tower itself, how to get to the top is the most interesting part. Based on what you prefer, you can do a 3.5 K rolling hill walk, combination of flat walk with some decent hikes - some through steps and rest through single lane path, series of steps all the way to the top or take the cable car to the top. If you are staying nearby, good area to go for a morning walk or a run", October 2019
110,4.0,What a lovely place,"There are so many ""LOVE"" lock place everywhere down the Tower, make u feel full of love before go up to the Tower.

124,3.0,Tourist trap?,"Every travel guide to Seoul recommends you to visit the N Seoul Tower, but after queuing up in the long lines to take the cable car up, you are faced with another long queue and expensive tickets to head up to the observatory. Way too crowded and too much lights from the sign to get a nice night view of the city. You can give it a miss if you have other things to do on your itinerary.", June 2019
125,4.0,A very nice place to visit,I went during the day so I could see the area clearly. The views were very good and the windows on the observation deck showed what major city was in that direction and how far the distance is from there., October 2019
126,3.0,Spectacular view,"One can walkdown,by bus or cable way to reach to the bottom of tower.the surrounding is natural,picturesque.Observatory desk not too high and view also not clear.The speciality is one can bind a lock to the fencing and take photos.But its not a big tower than shanghai,tokyo,sydney and burgkhalifa of dubai.", October 2019
127,5.0,Night time,"I went at night time and bought a 1 way ride to N tower, there was a kpop band doing a concert their which you got to watch for free, the views of seoul at night were amazing. If you give during the day you can enjoy the park aswell. There is loads to do at N tower. The walk back was stunning. Just be careful on some of the stairs as they are close together", October 2019
128,5.0,Fabulous view,Do go there if you get the chance! The drive to the top of the hill is through a beautiful park.Cars have to park at the bottom but buses are allowed to drive three quarters of the way up.There is a steep climb at the end but well worth it! You are taken into a room with  a picture of cars travelling along on the floor which was quite spectacular.The ride in the lift up to the top was spectacular with a visual experience.Outstanding views at the top with great photo opportunities. Loved it., September 2019

From Namsan library we chosed to walk steep 1,6 km..not to hard in autumn since the cool temperature. it was beautiful and crowded especially during the sunset time.everything trying to find the perfect spot for taking video/ pictures during sunset. there are some cafes down there, food not bad but the service is quite long. Going down no problem there were some busses that would take us downtown.", September 2019
131,1.0,What a disappointment!,"We're not gonna complain about the hours it took to get to the observatory because had it been a good experience we would've forgot about the hasssle; but it was not! Once we reached the observatory, we couldn't enjoy the view as the reflection of the food and drinks' station light on the windows ruined the view let alone how dirty the windows were! AVOID!", October 2019
132,3.0,Could be better,"Too many lines. No sign posts. View of city was not clear since the glass was reflective. The view from nearby Signeol Seoul was much much better. If in Seoul, one could consider going to tick off the list but this one's quite average.", September 2019
133,5.0,Great view,"Was a big walk up, we chose not to take the sky lift, take plenty of water and good shoes. Its doable though and worth the good work out. Great views by the time you get to the top the tower is more like a lighthouse, so don't be worried if issues with heights. Beautiful views, worth seeing!", October 2019
134,4.0,Great views of the city,, October 2019
135,5.0,Namsam Tower in Seoul,"Namsam tower is a must go not only for locals but visitors alike, especially I you're looking for a romantic scenery. Although it can get a bit crowded sometime, it is well worth the travel at least once in your life. It's not only for couples so don't feel left out if you are alone. If you are a couple, bring a lock with you to ""secure"" your love on a rail fence at the top. My suggestion is to go right before sunset instead of daytime, the city lights is very beautiful so you can observe both day and night while you're up there.", October 2019
136,4.0,Lots to do,"Lots of development around the tower over the past several years. My favorite way to get there is walking one of the many paths through the woods. I get lost every time I go so I will not try to give directions.  Other options to the tower are cable car and bus. There is are shuttle buses that regularly circle loops between popular tourist destinations - this is easy and convenient. The tower now has many little shops, restaurants, coffee shops... plenty of snacks and trinkets to buy even without buying a ticket to go up the tower. This is nice in case you are there on a cloudy day when it’s not worth the $$ to go up the tower.  Also plenty of photo ops and opportunity to get a love lock or leave your cell phone cover on the fences (not sure what this is all about)... visit the hello kitty island, etc. a trip up the old radio tower is quite spectacular - they have a neat light display before the fast elevator ride to the viewing floor.  On the observation floor there are signs to let you know what you are seeing, pretty amazing views on a clear day, and (of course) shops to buy snacks and souvenirs. It’s been ages since we visited the restaurants up in the tower. It was a nice experience however, limited vegetarian options and not really great for little children.  Overall a good place to visit, better on a clear day, wonderful to get a little exercise if you have the time and ability. Something for everyone at the tower  - I would go again and absolutely bring friends/family when they come to visit.", September 2019

138,2.0,Waste of time,We spend lots of time waiting in line to go up and even more to go down. The view from the bottom of the tower were maybe even better than from the top. Really overrated site., June 2019
139,4.0,Love the tower grounds,Even before you go up to the tower the surrounding grounds look pretty. Lots of selfie time with beautiful backgrounds. The love locks area..the love archway when lighted up.  Go there during the evening time and you can have both the day and night time photos. A few eateries like mainly drinks...snacks..cafes..can be found there. View from the TOP of tower was so so to me..but the elevator ride up there was swift and interesting because you were asked to look up to view the show about the tower I think..think it was done so you will be distracted and not feel nauseous when climbing up at a speed to the TOP floor., August 2019
140,4.0,Impressive with great views of Seoul,"Recommend coming here in the evening for a great view of Seoul lit up. I didn't go on the observation deck, but managed to get good views of the city from down below. There are a few reasonably priced restaurants on the lower floors of the tower.

149,3.0,N seoul tower !!,"There are 2 ways to visit N seoul tower, by cable car or to hike up. My siblings and i decided to hike up as the cable car waiting time was 1 hour. It was a long hike with stairs and its tiring. So I recommend to take the cable car if you are with kids or if you dont plan to exercise 😂😂 N seoul tower itself was nice, the view was great !! 😍 its mostly just enjoying the view and also chilling around that area ! So if you love looking at the views and take photographs then this is for you otherwise there’s nothing much to do.", September 2019
150,5.0,A nice getaway from the busy city,The view of Seoul city is beautiful to see from this place. I recommend to come here by sunset.

153,4.0,Birthday trip,"Seoul North Tower was the final stop of our first day tour in Seoul. I can truly say that we were not ready for walk up the steep hill/incline/mountain (lol)  to get to the tower. Of course. there’s easier way to via Tram. But we decided to be brave, it was a real workout, but worth it. Our guide took care of tickets and other requirements for us to get into the Tower. What an amazing view. What was most noticeable to us was the cleanliness of the place. Well maintained (in comparison to my experience at the Tower in Paris). Although, it was crowded, walking around was easy. An highlight for me was the toilets in Tower. Our guide suggested that we should see it even we didn’t want to use it. (Pic below). There also other attractions on the grounds of the Tower as well. Well worth a visit, but be sure you are rested and ready to take it all in, ( they do have comfortable sitting areas).  We spent approximately 1hour and saw most it had to offer.", September 2019

This is my second time hiking up the hill. This time I took the stairs which were packed and it it is around an hour to get to the top with a multitude of breaks for taking photos. The hike is moderate but those with knee pain might find it difficult. I wish we had taken the other hike, not up the stairs but we couldn’t remember how to get to it. The views were nice and sunset beautiful. We took the cable car down.", September 2019

158,4.0,Fantastic View of Seoul,A lovely way to see all the landmarks of Seoul once you reach the top. The best was before going to the top there was a 3D room with some amazing 3D animation. We were not able to enjoy and we were in a rush.

169,5.0,N Seoul Tower (Namsan Tower),"Not to be missed for korean drama enthusiasts! This famous landmark is seen in a lot of kdramas. It is great for a lovely stroll, date night, and sightseeing. Best to go just before sunset during the summer season to avoid the heat and to have a great sunset view. If using the cable car to get to the namsan tower grounds, get a roundtrip ticket as this will be cheaper rather than getting a one way ticket going up and then deciding to get another one way ticket on the way down. You could, if you’re trying to save money. But you would probably be too tired to hike down that you’re most likely going to end up taking the cable car on your way down again anyway. There is a separate ticket to get in to the namsan tower itself. It is not expensive so we did it. I was glad we did, as it gave us a 360 degree view of the city. It was really nice, as everything is lit up at night and you could see the view in a very colorful setting.", August 2019

On the floors at the base of the tower you will find restaurants. I thoroughly enjoyed this sightseeing excursion and did it at the beginning of my trip.

It's on a much smaller scale than the TeamLab Borderless one but amazing nonetheless. You will have to pay more to go up but so worth it, the observation views are gorgeous and you really get a unique view of this special city.
