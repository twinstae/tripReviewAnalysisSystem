0,4.0,Big mall with a lot of variety ,The mall is huge and you can buy almost anything you need. Parking is not difficult with payment deferred if you shop. The supermarket is also big and complete. Lines are not too long and there is a tax refund options if you bring your passport. You can spend the whole day here, January 2020
1,5.0,Among the best in the world of retail shopping ,"This department store has basically everything you need. From mid range to luxury fashion items. Various range of restaurants in the food court. But for now , clothes are mostly geared for winter. At the same period , most bases are covered.", December 2019
2,5.0,Great for shopping,Very big department store for shopping. Many options of Korean brands & international brands. A lot of food selection and Korean deserts. Located at the heart of Myongdong area, December 2019
3,1.0,Extremely Poor Service,"Dear Store Manager, I had a horrible experience at Dr Martens counter in Lotte Department Store, Main Branch. On 1 Jan 2020 night, decided to head to Lotte to get a pair of Dr Martens. Travelled all the way there because I had pleasant experiences shopping there a few days ago. Young sales guy Dr Martens guy was so reluctant and unmotivated to even get me the size to try. He wore an extremely cold facial expression. It seemed like I was giving him extra work. He tried looking for the size in the cupboard but it wasn't available so he took his keys and went to the storeroom to look for it. It wasn't a pleasant experience but I let it go. When he return, he came back with a different model. Told him that wasn't the one I requested to try. He tried to argue with me and said that was the pair I wanted. I showed him the pair I wanted to try. It had a different material and looks but he insisted I was the one to request to try the other model. He was probably too lazy to walk to get the right pair for me so he blamed it all on me. This is thus far the worst service I ever had in many countries. Told him off and walked to Myeong Dong Dr Marten store and bought a pair. TLDR: Bad service from Staff. Its touristy. People from China are going to buy in bulk regardless of good or poor service so why the need to serve you well. They just focus on China tourist. Even China has better service than this.", January 2020
4,4.0,Good place to shop for branded Goods,See many Tourist buying Cosmetic in bulk. Many bring along the big luggage with wheel. Was at the cosmetic level and it's clouded. Can see some sitting on the floor near toilet for rest and transfer shopped items into the luggage ready for next round of shopping. Some branded sunglasses also giving good discount., December 2019
5,2.0,Not The Best Place for Korean Items,"If you’re looking for authentic Korean items, this is not the ideal place to shop. However, if your goal is to shop for high-end items that are available elsewhere for better prices, then you would enjoy shopping here. I was looking for Korean brands and unfortunately, not many were around the store. I ended up crossing the street and shopping at Myeongdong instead. The Food Court, on the other hand, is a different story. Filled with so many choices from savory items, Korean coffee, pastries and confectionery, it’s a haven for foodies. There are also a few places to eat that offer delicious food.", December 2019
6,1.0,Staff there is very rude!,I went at 12 F and looked for cosmetic product. The staff there dont even know english. And when i asked this one counter. Cannot remember what the shop name. But its near escalator. Maybe pop up store. She was playing with her phone. Then i asked few times and she refused to answer my questions. Keep on playing with her phone. Then after few times then she answered its a toner without looking at my face. And keep playing the phone. Really disappointed with what happen., November 2019
7,1.0,MAC counter has a rude staff,"Well, tonight I have very bad experience on MAC cosmetics counter in Lotte Department Store ever as a tourist in a quite luxury place with some other luxury brands inside together. The girl staff in cashier looked to inside my wallet 'twice', somebody in charge who see this review just check your cctv, I'm sure all recorded,it was around 8:15 pm until 08:30 pm, November 22nd, 2019, before I paid and after I paid and gave the money to her friend, they don't speak English well also, and nobody said sorry at all. Is it their manners sell as quick as possible without consideration to serve customer well as I am as a tourist??? For sure I won't be back to this cosmetic counter ever, when I visit Seoul next time. Here I put a picture of the receipts showing time and date of purchase.", November 2019
8,5.0,Huge food hall; gorgeous store,"Every floor in this store is eye candy for a shopper. Every brand I’ve ever heard of and many I haven’t can been found here. I bought an adorable purse from a Japanese women’s golf clothing designer. They have a huge makeup and skincare department, and even a Lush Bath and Body section. Then there’s the basement. It’s a grocery store, food hall, and confectionery.  It’s huge and it’s a delight to the senses.", October 2019
9,4.0,Mall,You can find everything in this mall Mall that is close to Seoul Station. Very easy to get and also very large to shopping in., October 2019
10,5.0,Nice shopping,"We""ve spend 1.5 hours there. A bit expensive, but very posh.Nice clean and a lot of brands there. Not many people. Parking in front with parking service.", September 2019
11,4.0,Huge nall,"After visiting Lotte world, a visit to the department store just flow naturally. The mall is huge and as per instinct we drifted unto the basement and in search of food. Not disappointed as I am able to sample and buy some of the local delicacies. We also bought some food items and wears from the department store.", September 2019
12,4.0,Good mall to kill a few hours but be prepare to spend!!,"The mall is huge and will take a few hours at least to walk though every level and every wing.Lots of international brands and boutiques charging prices that are more or less the same anywhere else in Asia, even if you factor in the tax rebate.  There are some floors dedicated to local designers and brands and even those seemed very pricey to me.  I looked at some casual weekend dresses and that ranged from about KRW 250k (USD 200) and upwards going to multiples of that amount. The best part of this mall is the basement food level.  Lots to see and choose and try. Similar to the foodhalls you would find in Malls in Tokyo or Harrods in London.  I enjoyed browsing and choosing gifts for friends and family. I snacked on quite a few things as I went along. Lovely few hours I spend in there but did actually buy much other than food and gifts.", July 2019
13,4.0,Excellent food hall,"Of course the store sells all the items expected of any and all high-end retailers which one can find almost anywhere in the world -- but the basement food hall and grocery store is worth the trip. Yes, you can purchase ""street foods"" and sit in the dining hall to consumer, or peruse the limitless items in the grocery to take home to cook yourself. Either way, foodies will love this place -- though we have found prices of identical grocery items to be a bit less expensive at the Shinsegae Department Store a few blocks away.", June 2019
14,5.0,Very nice mall,"I really liked this mall, particularly the basement area where the grocery, food court and bakeshops are located. The food available here are all so interesting and varied, from cakes, breads, kimchi, Korean side dishes, to hot dishes that can either be eaten on site or brought home.", May 2019
15,4.0,Lots of lots of shoppers,"Came here on Korea’s Memorial Day and there were many shoppers, mainly Mainland Chinese tourists. It is mainly the high end stuff, such as cosmetics and clothing they come for.", June 2019
16,4.0,Upscale; Wonderful Food Court,"This massive multi-floor department store stood across the street from my Seoul hotel, so I went over to check it out one day. It seemed to be a typical upscale store, similar to myriad others in the world, with many boutique shops and most prices on the high end. I noted many Korean-made items available. All floors looked well maintained and had nicely displayed merchandise. It was early November and the whole place was already beautifully decorated for the upcoming holiday season. I didn't interact with any employees so cannot comment on the staff and service. The food court in the basement, however, brought me back to Lotte twice. I ate two very good dinners (Chinese and Korean) there and found the staff upbeat and pleasant. The cashier for the food court and at least one person at each order counter spoke good English. The area became crowded in the early evening, and I shared my table with a local resident on each visit. Both became lovely dinner companions as we discussed many topics, including what not to miss during my exploration of Seoul. For those looking for good buys, I cannot recommend Lotte, based on what I saw. But there are plenty of other places nearby, such as Namdaemun Market with its estimated 10,172 stores. It offers bargains at many shops and provides a totally different experience from typical department stores", November 2018
17,3.0,Upmarket ,It’s a nice upmarket store with some high end brands. It’s not so where to go looking for great shopping bargains. Quick visit to realize out of my price range, May 2019
18,4.0,Things seemed more overpriced than other places,I stayed at the lotte hotel right next to this main store. I felt the prices are a bit higher than other places. It is very convenient if you don’t like leaving the hotel and things. Overall it is very nice mall., January 2019
19,2.0,Mixed service levels,I am not how to start. I needed some travelling supplies while on vacation and went to one of the boutiques in the store to buy some. When the clerk realized I only wanted travel size products her English skills suddenly evaporated. I made my way to the luggage department hoping to find something there. They didn’t but the staff led me to the department I could find it in. My thinking is the staff in the high end shop should be trained by the people who trained those in luggage.  I have shopped in other “high end” stores and my expectations are that the greater the value of the goods the more valuable the service is. I don’t expect attitude only good service. This experience has coloured my opinion of Lottie’s as a “high end “ store.  My rating is based on Lottie’s being a high end store., January 2019
20,3.0,Not what I expected!,"Lotte Department Store.. THE MAIN STORE??Yes it is big. Yes there are 3 /4 floors for duty- free( enroll first)But to me, I didn’t know the limitations till  I had a look see !Other than the duty- free section( absolutely packed with tourists) , I would not be bothered ( cf Hk’s  malls,)Made in Korea is the  theme... the best section is 5he ground floor FOOD.. yes, a  world wide selection of imported/ local foods... impressive!For a resident Korean.. RATE... maybe. 8/10(what other choice is there?)It’s the biggest shop in the country.. the FLAGSHIP... I am a tourist, and can compare!!!", November 2018
21,3.0,Many brands here but bizarrely missing a toy section,"Came here to see one of the major departmental store in Seoul.  One thing to note:. They close at 8.30 pm on weekends (8pm on weekdays).  Didn't notice this unusually early closure for a Korean business.  Anyway lots of brands (luxury) here as with major departmental stores do.  But in a bizarre twist, there wasn't a toy section here.   A sign indicated that it was relocated to Star Avenue but subsequently was not found either.  More about that later.If you are looking for bargains, there won't be any.  If you ask me, they seemed targeted at the Chinese market primarily.  They even have Chinese translators at the ground floor with many staff who can speak Mandarin.  So we know who are their target customers.Anyway, about the Star Avenue, it was first a waste of time looking for the toy section there as it turned out to be a passageway outside featuring famous Korean stars.  Now they have these palm imprints (of the stars) on metal plates along this passageway where u r supposed to be able to bring up a video of this star when I place your palm on it.  It didn't work for most of them.  So don't waste your time.  Stick to YouTube.", December 2018
22,5.0,Luxury items all in one place!,"Everything that you would want to buy under one roof. Easy access to public transportation and very convenient and easy to get to. They also have supermarket with food court available, for you to have coffee after your long shopping trip. Nearby are Avenue L and Myeongdong Shopping area.", November 2018
23,3.0,Large mall great food court ,"The mall itself was no biggie, just like any other big brand mall in Asia. Was pleasantly surprised with their foodcourt in the basement. Reminded me of those high standard ones in Tokyo. Getting to an elevator took a lot of patience..", October 2018
24,4.0,Everything is here,"The place is composed OF The whole Building. IT has everything you want to buy. Above floors are for shopping whole The basement is The supermarket and Food court. After shopping, prices are reasonable, we ate at The Food court at Panda express. There are a lot OF choices for Food, desserts and confections. A good half a day to spend.", November 2018
25,5.0,Massive,Staying at the Lotte Hotel Seoul gave us the easy excess to this department store as it's just a walking distance down the escalator from the hotel lobby. It is so huge and down below the department stores are the supermarket and dining area. We manage to grab our lunch here at the food section., October 2018
26,5.0,Shopping,"Many things to buy. Lots of brand. Nearby Lotte Mart like a supermaeket for buying some food, snack and beverage. Also, price is cheaper than other supermarket.", October 2018
27,4.0,Very crowded popular shopping mall with a few floors dedicated to duty free,"It was a weekday yet so very crowded! The mall is very big and has many floors. I recommend to check the directory for what each floor offers, so that you can better understand where to go. Otherwise you spend a lot of time navigating thru the crowds and floors. There are some floors dedicated for duty free shopping, which seemed the most crowded with shoppers pulling trolley bags to contain their things. Be prepared for the long queue to make payment for your shopping goods!", October 2018
28,3.0,Too crowded,"It is a huge shopping mall, be prepared by wearing a pair of comfortable shoe wears. We went during the weekend, despite the size it was still very crowded. I would advise do some reading and know at least a little of the mall map, or else you'll have to spend more of being lost.", August 2018
29,5.0,Great store for shopping,"This one of the main department stores in Seoul.  It is comprehensive in that it has a large food court, clothing, beauty, travel and many other features.It was an easy walk here from my hotel Prince hotel.

31,5.0,Impressive shopping area with plenty of food!,"This Western department store is massive, with endless amounts of shopping! The food options are fabulous (but don't eat at Elbon on the 14th floor!!!). They offer substantial dining options downstairs, and nicer restaurants on the 13th and 14th floors (only accessible using the hotel elevators, the department elevators only reach the 10 floor).There is a Krispy Kreme in the basement if you're homesick for America, and go deeper to find the Euljiro 1 metro stop on the #2 line (green line). It's a pretty impressive destination if you happen to be in the area.", July 2018

33,4.0,All the brand names are here,"A large department store filled with tourists, we were here on a weekday And it is jam packed. Lots and lots of brand names and luxury goods items. We were a little disappointed that they didn't carry more Korean local designers . But there are a few floors dedicated to duty free shopping. So spend away !", June 2018
34,4.0,Typical large dept store,"A large department store along the lines of its Japanese counterparts with lots of eager Chinese tourists in the luxury goods ( particularly cosmetics dept- well actually in much smaller numbers already due to recent strained ties between the two countries). Lots of brand name goods, but if you are looking for more diverse fares there are lots of other options in Seoul", June 2018
35,4.0,Cheaper to buy LINE friends stuff from the tax free ,"Every morning, there is a long line of Chinese tourists forming outside the building and they’re only let it when the department store opens. The tax free floors are between 9-12 while the rest of the building stays closed till their opening time of 1030amThere’s a LINE shop somewhere between floors 9&10 and though it’s not a full fledged shop. They sell most of the popular items like stationary or plushies. They sell in both USD and KRW. But even with the USD conversion rate to KRW, the items are still cheaper to be purchased here than the LINE friends shop! TAX FREE for the win! Enjoy and don’t forget to check out the supermarket on B1. It’s not huge but some of their offer items are damn good! And value for money!", May 2018
36,3.0,Feedback on the Food Departments!,"Just a feedback on the Food halls at Lotte Department Store at the basement. If you are looking to buy tidbits, snacks, seaweed, etc. To bring home, the choices here are rather limited and do compare prices if you are buying a lot. We bought our items here but was disappointed to find prices for the same snack elsewhere in independent marts cheaper by 10,000 won and others by a few thousand won. Sharing so you won't have the same experience. Check out before buying. Of course they may still have items cheaper just that we didn't buy those perhaps.", May 2018
37,1.0,Not many choices,Items are highly priced. Shopkeepers are arrogant and not friendly. I feel that Koreans are arrogant in reel and real life., May 2018
38,5.0,It has almost everything,"Amazing shopping center that seems to have anything that you wold need. It is really large so it can be quite hard to find specific items. We stopped by before heading off to get tteokbokki chips, among other things. They have empty boxes available  at the checkout for carrying items. There is also tape and ribbon to pack the boxes. We essentially packed what we brought and left for the airport.", December 2017
39,5.0,Love it!,"We stayed at Crown Park Hotel which is across from this mall. It is huge dept store that sells duty free brand items. Global Blue tax free shopping onsite.

44,3.0,Not Your Typical Department Store,"First impression see the main floor with your standard beauty booths.  When we arrived the top floor; we decided to leave immediately.

Luxurious prices too!Food halls in the basement are nice, elaborate and offer a wide selection of gourmet foods. If you're looking to have lunch, the choices are mainly Asian food. Not much in terms of diverse western cuisine. However, for Korean, Japanese, Chinese food you're well taken care of. Self service, but stalls offer a broad variety of choices.Upstairs this is a typical department store. You can find many brands that are popular in Asia, but perhaps less so in the USA. Restaurants on the 13th and 14th floors are Asian as well. Again mainly Korean, Chinese, Japanese.", December 2017

The Lotte ambience is cosy, a great place to shop here.In particular we love their nice & huge supermarket; with its interesting, wide, excellent & beautiful range of products. And the food section here is great especially the bakeries, & eateries too.Prices at Lotte are more affordable compared to the very upmarket Shinsegae or even Hyundai Department stores.

There is another branch just outside  Seoul Main Station.", November 2017
51,5.0,Amazing basement food hall.,"You must visit Lotte Department Store, the main branch.  If not for shopping but to visit the huge food court, food hall and supermarket.  The supermarket takes up one side, then there are hundreds of small food stands selling every food item imaginable.  Bakeries, wine shops and food shops line the exterior of the room.  At the far end is a large food hall with many food counters where you order food and then take to tables.  The presentation of the food, the high quality and wide selection is unbelievable.  One bakery OPS has luscious pastries, as do most others.  Difficult to pick one over the other.  To reach Lotte, take the green line 2, and get off at Euljiro 1 stop or you can take the blue line 1, and get off at City Hall stop and just walk over.  Take a browsing of the basement food hall.

Coffee-holics and dessert hounds? You’ll surely find the relaxing atmosphere at the basement your thing. It is a good respite from the shop-a-holics of Myeongdong.", November 2017

60,4.0,Good shopping,"This is definitely a good place to go if you can afford such brands: most of the brands there are more on the high end side e.g. MCM, Gucci etc. There is a bargain basement (where most people were there) and also a great food court (I hanged around there for most of the time). I am not sure if its a must go place because it is just a department store full of stores that are in fact on streets as well.", December 2016

76,4.0,The Harrods of Seoul,"I had never heard of Lotte World, Mall, Department Store, etc. before our recent visit to Korea.  Upon walking inside, I was instantly reminded of Harrods in London.  It is a luxury department store of that scale with a huge food court in the basement.  We didn't buy anything, but it was fun to shop.", April 2017
77,2.0,Very Subjective,"It's nothing but a multi-story Department Store with many International Designer Brands and an incredible number of cosmetics counters, comparable to Saks Fifth Avenue or Henri Bendel in New York or Harvey Nichols in London.  If I lived in Seoul or a tourist looking for tax-free Brand Name shopping, I would likely shop here.  If you are a tourist not interested in buying brands that are not available in your home countries, save yourselves the headache and avoid fighting through the crowds.  With the recent travel recommendations from one of the neighbouring countries, you may be able to enjoy walking through the Store without getting bodychecks these days.The Poor Rating is not a reflection of the Department Store itself but simply the whole retail experience.  It was extremely crowded and noisy when we visited.", February 2017
78,5.0,The Store in Seoul,"This is the Store of Seoul. This time, I have seen so many more pretty things from France than ever before, which more than a decade ago.  The duty free shop on top floors were replaced by visitors from China rather than Japanese tourist as before.Not much of a shopper these days, in my tender age, I didn't get to see everything but food court was a necessary visit. I gave 5 star rating for it being the hub-bub of MyeongDong attraction. Things can be more pricy compared to other areas in Seoul.  I am glad that the place maintained its popularity and evolved to cater the younger crowds & foreign visitors as even for choice of food in the lower floors.Somewhat crowded but this is the story of Seoul.I give credit to Koreans that tried their best to meet up to the standards of westerner or foreign visitors.", December 2016

There are almost every leading world brands of bags, cloths and accessories coming. Just coming out from Incheon Airport, special shopping coupons at Lotted Department Store are seen everywhere. But the terms and conditions are not user friendly such that deterring customers from using it eventually. The inner design and layout of the department store seems a bit old, in compare with its entrance and ground floor design. On floor 8th, there was a bridge connecting to nearby Lotte Young Plaza. One catching note is, there are mouth wash steriliser and cups facilities for customers to have mouth wash, fantastic!", December 2016

Since this mall is higher end, there didn't seem to be too many sales worth going for, even on Black Friday. It's a nice place to walk around though. For younger and more trendy brands, there is the Lotte Young Plaza mall that is attached.

This flagship department store is similar to other department stores in that it sells plenty of clothes, home kitchen supplies, and other items.However, you really want to visit the basement of this store to see the groceries and food sections.  It did seem to be a little smaller than the basement food sections of department stores you see in Tokyo (e.g. Ginza), but it is still worthwhile to visit.  There are plenty of high end groceries (especially meats and seafood - and your expensive fruits and melons) at really high-end prices.  There are also plenty of small restaurants and stalls selling take away food and snacks, so allow yourself some time to go through the basement...The store is also conveniently located next to the subway line so it makes it quite easy to visit.", October 2016

91,1.0,Terrible and Irresponsible Staff,"So I bought a watch in this store and as I needed to obtain it in the airport, I handed my air ticket and passport for the shop assistant to arrange the pick-up time. The assistant wrongly inputted the date as 16/11 when it should have been 6/11. This mistake made me unable to obtain my item for which I had already paid, so I had to stop the transaction made via credit card immediately.What makes it even more frustrating is that the airport staff, after understanding my case, was unable to solve the problem for me. I left Korea without ever obtaining my item.Therefore, I truly found the staff irresponsible and unhelpful.", November 2016
92,3.0,Convenient,"This was our first family visit to Seoul with the in-laws, stayed at the Lotte Hotel World which is close to where family lives in Jamsil.  As an American, I prefer my South Coast Plaza/Nordstrom/Macy's, but this was convenient to have close by.  We were able to purchase a nice birthday gift duty-free for my mother-in-law's birthday celebration.  However, most the items were high-end luxury items, not necessarily the brands I would shop at home.  The food court and grocery store in the basement were convenient to have around, as were the Korean restaurants on the 11th floor.  Don't eat at the other ethnic restaurants--the Indian, Italian, Vietnamese food taste weird and are not authentic.  Stick with Korean, and the Japanese is OK.  The customer service is OK.  I feel smothered because they tail you as soon as you enter an area or show interest in an area.  I like having my independence and personal space.  If you are looking for more affordable shopping, go the the sections of the store bordering Lotte Mart -- there are some domestic low-cost brands there as well as a Zara.  Or walk further into the new mall at the Lotte World Tower, there is a Gap, Banana Republic, etc.  Or go to the basement into the subway area, there are tons of local stores and chains that sell items for $10-20.", October 2016

It is quite large and lots of shopping to be done.", August 2016
100,3.0,Different service standard at Duty Free,"The service downstairs at the 'normal' stores seems perfectly nice as one expects at this kind of high-end department store. However the customer service changes once you entered the upstairs duty free department. But it's probably due to the free market like atmosphere given by so many tourists at once. Counselling is not possible at this stage, you better get informed before you go there and just grap the things you are looking for. There are also many multipacks offered if not only.", July 2016
101,5.0,World-Class Department Store with Excellent Customer Service,"The Lotte Department Store is a classic, great department store, the kind that is now difficult to find in the US. It is many floors of high-quality merchandise. If you miss the great department stores which were once so common in the US but are now scarce, you will be in heaven here. Prices are fairly steep, but they were having good sales when I was there. They have a small army of staff - everywhere you look there is a smiling sales clerk waiting to assist.

We bought so much that we felt that we needed to put them all into a cardboard box. One lady staffing the seaweed section really went out of her way to get us not one but two boxes, sealed it up with masking tape and even made a handle so that we could carry it more easily! We tried to tip her W10,000 and she fought back!!! Lotte is clearly doing a great job with their customer service. Well done!!!", June 2016
112,5.0,Don't miss it - Definitely worth a visit,"This is one of the most famous (or at least most advertised) department stores in Seoul, and hence, from the time it opens till the time it's closed, there are huge crowds all over the place.

Have your passport (or the photo of it) and your return flight details, and have your VAT removed from your total. If you pay by Visa you can get 5-15% of the total bill. Negotiate it - with gold visa you can get 10%, with platinum -15%. In the main store you could find great fashion - local and international. The interns one isn't a bargain, but go for the local designers and objects - you will be pleasantly surprised both by look and by price.

Because of its quality problem(a screw was off), I  brought back to Lotte Bucheon store to repair it.  However, there is no more ELLE .  The ELLE counter left Lotte Bucheon.  So my purchased product became a homeless without after-service. Lotte Bucheon 's second floor cashier/customer center lady  asked me to pay 15,000won to repair the parasol.  I  told her it was caused by its poor quality, I  didn't break it.  But she said that there was no free after-service for every brand's parasols & umbrellas.  Very shocking.

We loved the food court and supermarket in the basement though, and it had almost everything imaginable from vegetables to cakes and sauces and fruits,  We bought a couple of punnets of strawberries for 8000  won each and they were sweet and ripe.", March 2016
126,4.0,Great food court,"This review is only about the food court level at Lotte Main.  It's an excellent place for eating and shopping for food items to take out, with the exception of wine and liquor (very limited selection, especially of liquor).  There are several casual restaurant style places where you can order mainly noodle/rice bowls and sit down at a table to eat.  And of course there are dozens of counters selling everything from sushi to pastries.  There's also a more traditional grocery store area with produce, meat/poultry/fish and other items.  If you go during the day it is quieter and easier to navigate, but one advantage of going within an hour or so of closing is that many of the more perishable items such as fresh-baked goods and prepared meal items with meat or fish are marked down for quick sale.  We were able to get dinner for two for about 10,000 won (less than $10) and a bag full of excellent pastries all marked down by 20%.  It's very crowded and bustling at that time but you can get some great bargains if you're willing to fight through the crowds.", March 2016

If you like shopping with a tremendous crowd and pushy customers then be my guest and shop at Lotte Main Department store. There were some sale items but most stores appeared to have relatively few discounts and even the specials and promotions they had going on were worthless or useless. Try going to the outlets where there are still hordes of people but at least there are some pretty cool deals if you look hard enough or are a comparative shopper. Avoid this department store if possible.", February 2016

134,5.0,Shocked With The People Flow,"Despite being pre-warned by my friend to either go early or before closing time, I was totally shocked with the people flow in the duty free section of the department store located at 10-11 floor.  This is particularly true to the cosmetic and/or skin care section,  Here, they needed to register your passports or foreign ID for tax free price.  You can take the purchased items right away under Korean brands, otherwise, you need to pick up the goods at the airport for foreign brands.  This duty free section will be opened for business 1 hour earlier than regular business hour - there is a special entrance at the back (near car park) to go up.", December 2015

136,4.0,Top notch department store in Myeongdong District,"In the heart of the Myeongdong district, shoppers will find the Lotte Department Store. This is the flagship for the Korean based chain and it is huge, providing many hours worth of retail shopping opportunities for those who haven't had enough from shopping the streets of Myeongdong. Lotte reminds me of the SOGO (Japanese) Department store that we have in Hong Kong. There is a bit of everything that department store shoppers might need; jewellery, clothing, handbags, shoes, accessories, make-up, electronics and a wide range of other goods. There is also a good lower level food court and supermarket at Lotte Department Store. The supermarket is enjoyable to browse even as a tourist. It is nice seeing the quality of foods available here. Overall, not sure if this is the best department store available in Seoul but you can certainly do a lot worse.  Lotte Department Store is directly accessible from the Euljiro Station for those interested.", November 2015

She really needs to quit or get fired. Needs better ventilation in the food court. My husband felt sick with all the smells in the tight, poor air area.Food court needs to provide sandwiches or other alternatives besides Korean food.

It is the largest department store in Korea offering high-end shopping to Koreans as well as visitors. It is directly connected to Lotte Hotel Seoul and is 5 minutes by foot from my Hotel, The Westin Chosen Seoul.You will find in the building a a wide variety of goods from reasonably priced Korean labels to world-famous luxury brands and also a duty-free shop. The food court located on lower level is huge. Lot of restaurants and food brands.The store is opened every day from 10.30am to 8pm.", June 2015

Not big enough for me, but maybe I am just used to the large malls we have in Manila. Was able to eat a salad at the food court. Supermarket was disappointing though. Not enough seaweed in my opinion.", October 2014
146,4.0,High end shopping,"We were a bit let down by shopping opportunities in Seoul, we thought it would be more like Tokyo and it isn't, so when we found Myengdong area and it's shopping opportunities we were happier :) Lotte department store was mostly out of our budget as it sells mainly higher end cosmetics and clothes, bags and other goods but if you are looking for higher end goods this is your place to go. The Shu Uemura section here is quite large as well and the staff was very helpful in getting us what we were looking for plus gave us a large pile of samples for free as well. Otherwise I'd suggest the neighbourhood around the department store- good quality, but cheaper cosmetic and clothing stores (even the western ones) and lots of cafes, restaurants and food stalls. The department store has a nice toilet though hahah :)", October 2014
147,2.0,Lotte Mall,We were disappointed with the selection of stores. We got the impression that Seoul would emphasise it's fashion outlets but there was little in the way of decent clothing.

148,4.0,Lots to love,"The Lotte Duty free is great for me because many of the luxury items that I love are not popular with Chinese tourists or Koreans. This means that luxury items that might be full price in New York are being offered at a discount in Korea.I've purchased designer frames, bags, watches, skincare, etc.  All great deals and so convenient to retrieve before your flight. You can take the Korean brands home with you on the day of purchase.It's worth the trip...Don't go on the weekends unless you are wearing mental armor.", June 2015

151,4.0,Koreans set the standard of luxury very well,"I'm American, and I frequent places like 5th Ave in NYC, Michigan Ave in Chicago, and Rodeo Drive - luxury, right?No.Lotte mall is ridiculous.  How you have all the luxury brands all on top of each other in one building is insane.  Who buys all this stuff?  Apparently, lots of people do, bc the place is packed with buyers, not just shoppers!If you are a foreigner, go upstairs to the duty free floors, where the best deals are.  The supermarket downstairs is cool to check out, and it's also the best place to get something to eat, like at the noodle bars.  Don't eat on the higher floors - it's overpriced and underwhelming.There are also 2 related malls next door with more designer goods, and the other one caters to the younger set.If you're American, realize that English isn't a standard out there, so you'll have some difficulty.", November 2014
152,2.0,Good Shopping but a Stifling Atmosphere!,"Make no mistake, the Lotte Dept. Store in Central Seoul near Euljiro 1-ga offers world-class merchandise. You will be completely overwhelmed by the breadth and quality of what you can buy at Lotte, whether it may be high fashion, food, or practically anything else.That said, the shopping experience leaves a lot to be desired. For example, half of the B1 level is an amazing food store, with Korean groceries, international delicacies, prepared food to take home or to eat on premise. But the floor itself is not optimally laid out, there are too many people and the ceilings are extremely low. I am also not a fan of the faux Baroque architecture typically found in Lotte stores.Once you experience B1, try to get to the Duty Free floors (9th-11th), which is likely the main reason to visit Lotte. First of all, I challenge you to find an elevator, let alone one you will be able to fit into. Once you get to the floors you will be completely overwhelmed by tourists! Times Square at Christmas is a cakewalk compared to this. My wife, who loves to shop and grew up in Seoul, swears she will never visit the Lotte Duty Free area again.The other issue with Lotte is the relative lack of subway access. You can directly access the subway #2 line at Euljiro 1-ga but this is the loop line. You will likely need to transfer or walk to a better Metro station. Even if you are staying north of the Han River (Kang-buk) you are better off visiting the Shinsegae branch at the Express Bus Terminal south of the river in Kangnam. It's less crowded and the overall experience is better. There is no Duty Free floor but that's a plus in my book. I recommend staying away especially if you have kids with you.", December 2014

However when trying to pay with MasterCard , my understanding was (told by a salesgirl with lousy English skills) that MasterCard is not accepted in Lotte. Then another girl on interpreter desk ( yes that was really the name...) told that MasterCard is not accepted in while Korea. That i already knew to be rubbish and told her that i had been uusina the sane card several times in stores much smaller and less fancy. Because of the poor English skills of the personnel they lost a customer and trust in their expertise- and I still dont know why my card wasnt accepted.

Once you are there I would recommend that you take a nice break for coffee or tea in the middle of your shopping time.", October 2014
158,3.0,Not well designed,"I have to say that the entire Lotte World is not well designed.  Maybe because I am a foreigner, I am used to things being designed for the masses, where everything that can go wrong, will go wrong, so you try to make things idiot proof for the first time visitor.  Like, this whole complex, the department store, the amusement park, etc, are all integrated into downtown Seoul.  Not the city center, but a side city, Songpa-gu.  In other words, Lotte World is the majority of Songpa-gu.  That being said, it is hard to figure out where Lotte World begins, and where it ends.  There is no guidance on where to go.  It is just there.  Park somewhere, figure it out.  No shuttles, no monorails, no people to tell you where to go. Just start walking and figure it out. But this is true of all of South Korea.  All of the signs inside, like where to find the bathroom or this or that, only get you half way there.  Seriously, you will follow a sign, and then there is no sign, and the thing you are looking for is nowhere to be found.  It is the most frustrating thing I have encountered.  It is almost like they said, we'll do you a favor, but not really. And that could not be worse in a city where the temperature and the humidity both hover around 90. You will need a shower before you find a drink of water.Sticking to topic, the department store:  So, the front entrance is kind of there where the hotel entrance is, and I see people getting off of buses, I guess for the amusement park.  But where do I go?  I just want to buy this damn toy helicopter that my girlfriend's kid who keeps asking for it over and over and over.  So, inside, am I near the department store?  Hell if I know. Finally, after wandering around, I find a long hallway that leads to some stores, and hey, there is a toys r us. I found the helicopter, but only after my friends bus had left. Different cultures, I guess.", July 2014

160,1.0,beware 2h exchange policy for manufacturing defects!,"i bought a pair of ray ban sunglasses from the lotte department store in myeongdong. i assumed it was in perfect condition since it was a brand new pair and was KRW 240000 (and you'd assume for it to be of a certain quality). i started using it only a few days after it was purchased. that was when i noticed a manufacturing defect on the frame. there was a bubble under the frame coating which can only be attributed to a fault in the manufacturing process.i brought it back for an exchange but it was stoically refused because any returns have to be done within a 2 hour time frame, even for products with manufacturing defects. needless to say i was pissed out of my mind and will never be purchasing anything from lotte department store again.when i enquired about the warranty, they said i had to take it to the local dealership myself. no further information was given except it would take 20 days for the local dealership to decide on whether any rectification will be made. by which time i would've long left korea.there is no customer service centre at lotte department store and when you have an after purchase problem with what you bought, all the previously eager beaver sales persons will shun you like the plague.apart from the 2 hour storewide return policy, the salesperson also examined then pointed out very tiny, superficial marks on the frame (which i'd made accidentally) to further justify the need to adhere to the 2 hour return policy. seriously?! how would it matter unless the lotte staff were going to take the defective pair and resell it to the next unsuspecting tourist.all the time during our conversation, she frequently asked for the sunglasses after which she'd try to scratch out the defect with her fingernails although i repeatedly asked her to stop it. she even tried to make off with it to somewhere else in the building to file the uneven frame coating down. like it's even possible and won't further damage the frame?!almost everywhere in lotte, you will have the same lousy customer service. before you congratulate yourself on the marginal savings (if any) you've made by purchasing it there, think of all the unpleasantness you'll have to deal with if you find out a few days later that the product is defective. while tourist dollars are welcomed, all else (e.g. feedback, exchanges and returns) are not, even where the product was originally defective.most purchases over KRW 30,000 are eligible for a tax refund but for all the saccharine sweetness of lotte salespersons (e.g. accompanying you to the cashier for their commission), not a single one will offer to print the tax refund form out for you even though you're obviously a tourist unless you specifically request for it with much difficulty in english. (the tax refund form has to be provided by the store in which you've made your purchases.)try it if you don't believe me! for all it's worth, i'll rather pay a few dollars more and get it anywhere but in lotte! 1st world department store run by scam artists.p.s.: my sunglasses are a lot worse for wear after the sales person's scrubbing and recounting my experience makes my blood boil.", June 2014

Even in Seoul itself larger department stores can be found. For example, ""i-Park"" at Yongsan Station is much bigger and has a more diverse assortment.If you're in the neighbourhood do visit the Lotte Department store by any means.

173,4.0,"Fancy, expensive, but worth a gander","I don't usually rate department stores because I'm not a big shopper. I did enjoy walking around this one though and having a meal on the bottom floor. Like other reviews mentioned, it's a lot of the same brands you'd find in a large western mall. Nice to look at, but not so nice to buy... well at least not on my budget.I do agree that the food court was nice. It's a little more expensive than some other meals, but really not that expensive for the quality. It's not all Korea food, but rather just various Asian cuisines. I sat down and had some soba noodles which reminded me of my previous stays in Japan.The 1st floor is mostly named brand makeup that doesn't have much to do with Korea and the following floors up until the 8th floor follow suit with other brand name products. Things change once you hit the 9th floor though. That floor is special in that it's duty free shopping. I guess it's the same kind of discount you'd get at the airport duty free, but I didn't check. You'll need a passport, flight ticket or at least to know your flight number to make a purchase.The duty free area of this shopping mall has turned into a must for Chinese tourists. Mostly because it's part of just about, if not every, Chinese guided tour group. During peak hours it'll be crammed pack and basically shoulder to shoulder. Given the target audience most of the employees on this floor can also speak Chinese fluently, but their English might be just a few phrases.It's right across the street from the Myeongdong outside shopping area, so it's a place you can stroll through quickly without going out of the way. Then you can cross it off your list, maybe pick up a few small duty free items and have a quick bite to eat in the food court.", August 2013

175,5.0,"Yes, another food court review!  But what a food court!!!","I have noticed that the food court at Lotte department store in Myeongdong has had a few mentions here.  Well, you do have to experience it to know why.  Almost the entire basement of this high class department store has been dedicated to food.  There is a grocery section, stall after stall of kimchi sellers, a branch of Fauchon from Paris, and then there is the hot food section.  Heaven...!  For those of you, including, myself, who salivates over street food but can't quite work up the guts to indulge, the Lotte food court will satisfy your cravings.  Our favourite were the deep fried fish cake sausages (I am sure the Korean name for these are much more romantic...), with variations including a sesame leaf or seaweed wrap.  These were simply delicious.  Table real estate is scarce for the number of people wanting to eat, but we always ended up with a table, and we aren't very aggressive about this.  There are also non-street food options, such as sushi, fish, noodle, and rice bars.

By the time I picked up the purchase at the airport, it was not the same exact purse the lady showed me. I remember details. The protective bag was missing and the purse didn't look as new as the one I was presented with at the store.

Seeing how the mall presents itself as a reputable retail organization,I was not prepared for the horrendous shopping experience that was to come. After this incident, I am thoroughly disillusioned and disappointed by the service standards of both Lotte and Givenchy.  I purchased a wallet from Givenchy and had collect it upon departure at the airport. When i arrived at the pick up point, I was informed that my the product had not been delivered to the pick up station. From what i can make out, the counter staff said that the Givenchy staff at Lotte Department Store made a mistake in the delivery date. I even went through with the hassle of reconfirming with Givenchy staff a few times on my date of departure to ensure that she was clear and understood me. How is it possible that after making a purchase of a product I am unable to receive it? To make the situation worse, I was made to cancel my purchase as it was the only viable option. From my experience, Givenchy did not have what it takes to match up with the other brands. I used to consider Givenchy one of my favorite brands and would often frequent the stores. I cannot say the same now. Shouldn't the management of Lotte Duty free offer me the option of shipping the product to me? Instead, I was made to cancel my purchase. Will they rather me not purchase from them at all?As a customer, it was definitely an unsatisfying shopping experience that left a bad taste in my mouth. I am unsure if consumer satisfaction is one of the management's top priorities as it is sorely lacking from my point of view. I strongly urge them to look into it.", March 2012
