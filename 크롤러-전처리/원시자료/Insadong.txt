34,5.0,Lively and good place to shop for souveniers,"Visited in mid December. I prefer this area more than Myeongdong. Lots of eateries, and lots of shops selling souvenirs. There are also shops selling cosmetics. So, if you are not a hardcore cosmetic person, you can actually shop around this area too. Ssamziegil is also a place worth visiting. It consists of little boutiques, stores/ shops selling cute little knick knacks. Just about opposite Ssamziegil, there is a toy museum and a tea house/ cafe.

Street vendors, shops, restaurants, a bit of arts and culture as well, a hot pot pf sorts of things.

It is in fact a very convenient walking street full of small shops and interesting little curiosities but I don't think it can be called in any way an antiques market.  It is a street, walking, no traffic (which is a blessing), with lots of typical vendors of tourist merchandise, caf√©s, snacks and so on interspersed with a few ceramics shops and the odd printed art shop.  For me it didn't do anything artistic nor antique, a pleasant diversion from the routine traffic, but nothing memorable.", November 2019

But if you can do both, then Insadong is a nice couple of blocks of arts and crafts stores with cafes interspersed.  The little alleyways and shops on the second and third floors are not to be missed as well.  Yes, it is touristy and fashionable but that's how this city rolls.  On the south end of the street there is a little open plaza where there are often street performers... worth a gander.

Expensive pottery. An embroidery store. A shop where an artisan made spinning objects of wood.

71,4.0,Walk-around,"Walk around Insadong can be quite relaxing if you are not there on the weekend when it‚Äôs really packed with tourists. Insadong is a traditional area of Seoul full of cafes, traditional stores and restaurants. We brought a Canadian tourist and it was quite hard to find a korean barbecue restaurant that did not offer pre-set already cooked meat but eventually we found one. We also visited a traditional tea house. It‚Äôs hard to navigate the restaurants on the iPhone as it gives the wrong location.

It is not quite a pedestrian only as there are delivery vehicles and taxis passing thru during the day, but pure pedestrian after a certain hour in the afternoon.  It is very crowded but still enjoyable to walk thru and experience the many shops, restaurants and gift shops.  Be sure to walk the many side alleyways, which are filled with restaurants and shops.  It is very safe.  Most of Insadong gil is smoke free another good feature.  And eventhough some areas are cobblestone, it is pretty much flat and straight for wheelchair accessiblity.", July 2019

165,5.0,"Nice area, all you need","Lots of boutique and artisan type shops as well as lower end souvenir shops further down the stretch, but the whole area is pretty clean and has a nice calm vibe about it despite being a busy/touristy area. You can stroll down the main street taking in all they have to offer while drinking your fresh strawberry juice and eating whatever you may find among the many options of street food (not for me - i quickly found spice allergy is a bit of an issue in korea!). At the bottom of the road there's loads of old guys at tables outside the edge of the park playing board games and at the top of the road you pretty much have gyeongbokgung palace, a nice contrast. The presence of the traditional korean spa here is reason enough alone to go to insadong, it's a bonus that it's a great area with so much else to offer too.", May 2019

172,4.0,"Getting more tourist oriented by the year, but I still always find something extraordinary.","I have been back to Insadong several times over the last several years. Over the past three visits I have seen more of the galleries and fine art places disappear and more places selling tourist stuff. Still there are places with beautiful art and crafts. I found a Chinese style teapot in a cream glaze with fabulous grey craqueleur. It was not cheap but it is not something you are likely to find anywhere else. Every time I have come here and wandered the streets, I have found something unique. So it is still worth visiting, tourists and all. There are any number of tea and coffee places, traditional Korean restaurants, and, if your are vegetarian, one famous vegan place specialising in Korean temple food, Sanchon. I do plan to return next visit.", May 2019

We did have a decent lunch in a side alley off the main drag, but the whole area just felt a bit fake and touristy.

177,5.0,Fascinating area to spend time exploring,"As I was staying right near Insadong, I had the area on my doorstep. There are hundreds of restaurants of varying quality and price. Generally, I've found dining out in Seoul to be quite expensive but it is possible to find cheaper meals if you're prepared to overcome the lack of language and give the food a go! It's delicious! There are some great shops in Insadong, though a bit touristy for my taste, so I didn't actually buy anything.
