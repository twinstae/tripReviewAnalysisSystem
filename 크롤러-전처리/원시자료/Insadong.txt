15,5.0,Insa-dong (Ïù∏ÏÇ¨Îèô) - The True Shopping Street for the Connoisseur.,"The True Shopping Street for the Connoisseur I entitle this review as Tripadvisor conveniently erased my review for the disappointing experience of the infamous Myeong-Dong Shopping. I guess Trip advisor only enjoys ""happy"" reviews; ok let me give you this one.This is the real street that we were looking for instead of the Myeong-Dong Shopping street filled with garbage. Insadong is actually pretty trendy and clean and filled with better shops where you can actually see food being manufactured life like the Dragons Beard. Also here you can find what I was looking for which is the famous art of Korean Calligraphy. Calligraphy in Korea is a visual art reflecting the Korean tradition of artistic writing in Hangul or Hanja. To the non expert let's call it: Handmade Hanji paper.In Korea, the act of giving a work of calligraphy created by one's hand to someone symbolizes the great respect the artist has for that individual, and is considered a true gift of the heart. So since this is our thing, me and my wife we decided to hunt for such gift and we found it. Truly exquisite pieces I might say and also as expected; expensive. But what a heck, we are here and no better time to acquire some of these beauties.There is an array of restaurants ranging from cheap to more expensive, diverse Asian tendencies and Western food as well.We also love teas in all their pure shapes and forms and here also we found an interesting place to taste and buy true green tea, fermented in several ways and in diverse presentations. mostly expensive as the process demands, but this is the street where you Don't Need to estimate.Highly recommended.", January 2020

34,5.0,Lively and good place to shop for souveniers,"Visited in mid December. I prefer this area more than Myeongdong. Lots of eateries, and lots of shops selling souvenirs. There are also shops selling cosmetics. So, if you are not a hardcore cosmetic person, you can actually shop around this area too. Ssamziegil is also a place worth visiting. It consists of little boutiques, stores/ shops selling cute little knick knacks. Just about opposite Ssamziegil, there is a toy museum and a tea house/ cafe.

I was very happy to get five  pieces of  lovely handmade hairclips and a toy gun in one of the alleys.There was also street performance on its pedestrianised main street to entertain the locals and tourists. We enjoyed strolling along the different alleys and browsed the shops and different knick knacks. In one of the alleys, we saw Dam Steak & pasta.

38,5.0,Touristy place but with a bit of cultural feel,"I visited in 2018 November first week. (Took too long to write a review. lol )There are a lot of tea houses here to visit.

40,4.0,Interesting area of Seoul,"Insadong is a bit of everything, hard to put it in a single box so to speak. It is a bit touristy no doubt, but it also has many other facets to it. Street vendors, shops, restaurants, a bit of arts and culture as well, a hot pot pf sorts of things. But when in Seoul I would say it is a must see and a stroll through the streets is a nice afternoon activity. Also to remember that many other key areas of Seoul are not far hence it is easy to combine this with visiting some palaces or myeongdong for example.", April 2019
41,5.0,Tourist Walkabout,"This area is incredible. It has an old and new feel about it. Shops with the traditional clothing updated for wearing today! Korean traditional masks and everything Korean.All shop names are written in Korean, including Starbucks!There are electrical wires hanging above shops and down alley ways!

Once walking through Insadong you reach the Palace.", December 2019
42,5.0,A place of culture and creativity,"If you are into creative arts and culture, this is the place to me.  There are lots of quirky shops selling handmade embroidery and local arts and crafts.  There is a beautiful building called Ssamzegil that is dedicated to the local arts and crafts and one can find a lot of treasures in most of the shops.  The items can be a bit pricey but some are worth having due to their uniqueness.  Definitely worth a visit.", December 2019
43,2.0,Another  tourist trap,"Insadong street/market is touted as an artistic and antiquities market, it was to be one of the highlights of my visit to Seoul.  It is in fact a very convenient walking street full of small shops and interesting little curiosities but I don't think it can be called in any way an antiques market.  It is a street, walking, no traffic (which is a blessing), with lots of typical vendors of tourist merchandise, caf√©s, snacks and so on interspersed with a few ceramics shops and the odd printed art shop.  For me it didn't do anything artistic nor antique, a pleasant diversion from the routine traffic, but nothing memorable.", November 2019
44,3.0,Nothing much,Walked pass this street on the way to The Runningman Thematic Experience Centre. Did not strike me as exciting or there is much to do. Visit only if you are around the area., December 2019
45,4.0,Short and sweet,"If you only have time to do either Myeongdong or Insadong, no brainer; skip Insadong.  But if you can do both, then Insadong is a nice couple of blocks of arts and crafts stores with cafes interspersed.  The little alleyways and shops on the second and third floors are not to be missed as well.  Yes, it is touristy and fashionable but that's how this city rolls.  On the south end of the street there is a little open plaza where there are often street performers... worth a gander.  And beside the plaza is a manned tourist info booth if you need tourist info of course.", November 2019

Unlike Myeongdong, you will not find the typical shopping items like sports wear and cosmetics but instead, it is easier to browse around and you can buy souvenirs that are uniquely handcrafted.

55,5.0,A wonderful street in Seoul,"Boutiques, restaurants (check the side alleys for the best ones!), tea shops, Insadong has everything!

58,4.0,Decent shopping experience,"When you come to Seoul you can experience different shopping experience based on which market place you visit. Insadong has it's own nuance when it comes to shopping.  If you are in to masks, you will see lot of shops not only selling them but you will find some shops where you can watch a mask being made. Just like any other place in Asia, one should be able to bargain", October 2019
59,5.0,A delightful experience! ,"During our visit to South Korea, we ended up walking down this street 3 times. So many interesting things to look at. Beautiful clothing, possibly handmade. Expensive pottery. An embroidery store. A shop where an artisan made spinning objects of wood. During one visit there was an outdoor performance highlighting some aspect of Korean heritage, but because there was no English explanation I can't provide one either. I received the scarf below as a gift from family. A great way to spend an afternoon and purchase souvenirs.", October 2019

In the wider streets you can find cosmetic stores and restaurants open until late. There are also great AR/VR places (highly recommended experience, as they are cheap and lots of fun).You will meet there eople from all walks of life coming after a rough day at school or at work to eat and enjoy together, and also especially many young people dressed by latest K-pop and japanese inspired fashion.", October 2019

Insadong is a traditional area of Seoul full of cafes, traditional stores and restaurants. We brought a Canadian tourist and it was quite hard to find a korean barbecue restaurant that did not offer pre-set already cooked meat but eventually we found one. We also visited a traditional tea house. It‚Äôs hard to navigate the restaurants on the iPhone as it gives the wrong location.

If you want handcrafted bags, ceramics, arts then this is your place. But i find the commodities more expensive than in myeongdong. We stayed for 2 nights in this area and its quiet and exciting due to lots of restaurant nearby. Its just next to each other. Restaurants are the one you see in korean novelas where there are individual rooms for every guest. The area is close to palaces, airport bus station and subway .", October 2019
