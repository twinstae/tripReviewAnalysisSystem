0,5.0,Insadong,"I really like Insadong, not as crowded as Hongdae. What I like the most was it's ambience, artsy and peaceful. I went to Ssamzigil and it was really nice place! Instagramable and pretty.", February 2020
1,2.0,Could've been good,"Insadong used to be an artistic/artisnal haven before it became overy homogenized and dull. There is still the occasional good stuff in the back alleys (food mainly), but the main strip is tourist only traps.", March 2020
2,5.0,A taste of culture ,I wish we had a lot of time to spend here. We were in a tour and had a limited time to go around. Lots of food to taste. A lot of things to see. A lot of stores to shop. I'll come back for sure., March 2020
3,4.0,Quaint and Lovely Insadong,"I love Insadong quaint market - the small hallways that leads you to unique stores is a refreshing scenery from the busy streets of Myeondong and other shopping districts. The area also has restaurants and coffee shops that showcases delicious food - a resting place too if you wish to take a rest from going around. Somehow, it connects to Ssamziegil which also has a lot of shops - souvenirs, clothing, food and everything.", February 2020
4,5.0,Pleasant Walking Street,"This is a nice neighborhood style shopping area. If weather is cooling, itâ€™s a good half day walk through shops, cafe and restaurants.", July 2019
