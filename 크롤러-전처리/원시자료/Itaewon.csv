0,3.0,This place is amazing for some and terrible for others,"I stayed in Itaewon at the Hamilton Hotel for two weeks and have really mixed opinions on it. I'll separate it to make more sense.  Positives - a good destination, the subway station is right next to the biggest hotel here.  - the people in itaewon are about 60-70% foreigners,", August 2019
1,3.0,Suited for some,"In terms of neighbourhood Itaewon neighbourhood is like some London’s Zone 4 and beyond. Metro is on Line 6 so you need connections to get to the more popular Lines 1, 2 and 4 destinations. So Itaewon has the basic offerings but the market is not like Namdaemoon, the underground mall is not like Hoehyeon and the shopping is not as upscale as Myeongdong. I find accommodation there expensive relative to other outskirts. The area is slopey thus unsuitable for the not so fit. On the plus side: there is direct access by limo bus to Incheon airport. The affordable food joints are aplenty and its a haven for muslim travellers with a mosque and many choices of halal offerings. And for party goers, there are plenty of hip joints. The food joints open till late. As Seoul has excellent and affordable public transport system, I would stay elsewhere for cheaper accommodation (there are also other places with connections to airport and the city) but visit Itaewon on need basis like I visit central and busy Myeongdong.", December 2019
2,4.0,An evening out...,Great neighborhood for an evening out and when you feel you’d like a drink and meeting a place where locals and foreigners mix at ease.Many bars to chose from and generally an easy going atmosphere. Worth a visit!, November 2019
3,5.0,Cool Neighborhood,"Great area, lots of activity and great walking streets. Lots of food options. Safe and clean as is typical in Seoul.", November 2019

6,4.0,Good Old ....Itaewon !?!?,"Perhaps it just me.  Perhaps  today was a Debbie downer in the area.  Perhaps the day of the week wasn't right.  Perhaps the coin showed Heads instead of tails.   Or ... really... perhaps gentrification is starting to set in.   It appears to be more of the last one.   Went to Itaewon for the first time in 18mths today, and whilst its still a great place, I felt something was a little off about it.   Refurbishment is starting to happen, there appear to be more empty shops, Bigger name franchises seem to be occupying more shop space, and with the move of USFK Headquarters to Pyongtaek, the foreign pedestrian traffic has significantly dropped.   I understand that the Seoul Metropolitan government has goals for the area.   Hopefully they have a positive impact on the area as Itaewon is a great place to go.   I guess we will have to wait and see.", October 2019
7,4.0,Hopping area of Seoul!,"Had never had a chance to visit Itaewon until recent visit to Seoul.  Packed with shops, restaurants, pubs, and massage, this seems to be the energy center of Seoul.  Fun place to walk around, enjoy a drink and watch people!", July 2019
8,2.0,3 night stay in Itaewon,"I have worked in South Korea for 10 years and visited Seoul and in particular Itaewon on a few occasions, for relaxing, shopping, food and nightlife. Each time has been a great experience across the board, however these past few days the experience was much less so.Hotel: Seoul was very busy last week due to events at the olympic stadium and also some sort of demonstrations so most hotels were heavily booked out, so booking as late as I did left little options in the Itaewon area.I chose the Hannam 67 Hotel which is about 1km walk from the Hamilton Hotel. Location was ok, but the hotel was extremely over priced and was pretty much a Korean style ""love hotel"" which are usually ok for a night or 2 but normally run from 60,000kwn to 80,000kwn. This hotel was charging 150,000kwn/night.Room was barely ok, very small, clean but very noisy in the mornings. Bath towels were many years old and had extra large holes in them. I would not stay there again unless no other options.Taxis around Itaewon and Lotte World & Myeongdong areas:Due to so many people in town the taxi drivers were for the most part extremely rude and tried to hold me to ransom on numerous occassions by refusing to use the meter and trying to charge 30,000kwn up front for a 6,000kwn fare! Yet if you walked to an area away from a taxi stand and where there were no people you got the taxi for the correct fare on the meter.Some very greedy taxi drivers around town these days!Business owners would refuse to assist me to try to call taxis even when I offered them my Korean ph to make the call for me.The local Kakao taxi call service was useless if the trip was too short for them to bother.All in all this experience was not what I had come across before. I certainly hope that this type of thing doesn't continue to get worse. Economy is down, businesses are closing and greedy people trying to rip of expats who local economy.I will not be going to to Itaewon, Lotte World or Myeongdong areas again.Disappointed to say the least.", October 2019
9,5.0,Great place,"Lots to do, walk the streets and window shop. Then find a quaint place and cool off with a drink and some food. We walked up a small hill and found the Thirsty Monk. Reasonable prices, good service, food and drinks! Excellent view of street below!", September 2019
10,4.0,"A strip of bars, but a good standard of bars","I was quite impressed with this neighbourhood because it had all the makings of a seedy area, but it was lit as far as I could tell. Good bars, high end restaurants, safe atmosphere - yeah, well worth a pub crawl down here again!", September 2019
11,5.0,Muslim friendly,"Itaewon has many halal restaurants and foods... not far from itaewon subway station, you can see line cafe & store. Cute place and many photo spots in here. You should go!", September 2019

13,5.0,Live all day,"The area is almost always awake. In the morning you can go shopping and at night you can enjoy one of the many available bars, clubs, and restaurants in the area. It was interesting to see almost everyone communicating in English here.", September 2019
14,5.0,Fun to be,"Itaewon is a great area fo meet a lot of foreigner in Seoul. You can party everywhere and eat food from around the world. But its not the ""Seoul"" you wanna visit for culture haha", October 2018
15,5.0,Eating place of Seoul ,This place offers a variety of places to eat from with different cuisines. The streets at night are vibey and with a lot more variety of ethnicity which I loved because my home town I see different kinds of people and after 1 week of seeing one kind of race it was REALLY so nice to see other kinds of ethnicities I’m used to seeing daily. Food was great here and with variety, June 2019
16,5.0,Energetic and alive night life area,"Bars and good music, I was there with a business friend to have a beer and we found this area great for young night life with bars and restaurant. If you want to feel Seoul young night life you must go there. Surly I’ll return.", June 2019
17,3.0,Holiday ,"We visited this place at night. This area is for the young. Bars, clubs, restaurants,Karaoke and dance venues. The music is deafening and the crowds of young people in the back alleys are beyond belief. Not much different to other cities of the world to areas that attract young people. Go to observe if you are a bit long in the tooth or partake if you are young.", June 2019
18,2.0,Unremarkable.,"Itaewon does have lively nightlife going for it, but it's not really distinguishable from any other western downtown. The food is fine, and pricey and underwhelming compared other parts of Seoul. During the day, it's fairly slow and skippable. Go if you want to get wasted, wade through shifty people and party late, but don't expect cultural fulfillment or a unique experience.", June 2019
19,4.0,Take the back alleys,The best restaurants and pubs are in the back alleys behind the Hamilton hotel.  Our favorite was a seafood restaurant named Boiling Shrimp Crab on the third floor.  Excellent cajun style seafood., May 2019
20,2.0,Fly for the Big Guy,"Itaewon has some great eats and would be the most popular place with foreigners. A massive US Military base is there so this is one of the only places to go in Korea for a big guy in search of clothes that fit. (T-Shirts, Tank Tops, Jeans etc.) There are a lot of bars and clubs and the seedier side of life is prevalent here. Not Somewhere for a first timer young lady foreigner on her own to go (unless you are into that). Some situations left my wife feeling a bit uncomfortable however we still had a great time here and did some good shopping.", May 2018
21,3.0,Itaewon - Multi nationalism in Seoul,"Itaewon is known for serving cuisine that are not widely available in Korea, such as those from India, Pakistan, Turkey, Southeast Asia, Britain, Germany, Italy, France, Portugal, Spain and Mexico. It's known as ""Western Town,"" reminiscent of cowboy towns in Western nations.", December 2018
22,5.0,Muslim Centre Of Seoul,They have a Mosque and muslim centre there. A lot of muslim and halal food. Its very convenient for those who choose to know about Korean Muslim culture., April 2018
23,3.0,I think it was better...,"...back in the day.  That day would be when it was mostly a destination for American GIs.  I guess Itaewon is now kind of an international area with lots overpriced foreign restaurants.  Seems to have a large Middle Eastern presence.   I walked around a bit reminiscing about the good ole days when I was a young GI back in 80s.  Now, I don’t fit.  I think young expatriates like it here, and there are some name brand stores that peaked my interest.", February 2019
24,5.0,International food galore!,It's an international food galore! Its a very hilly area to stroll but really worth the climb. Lots of halal restaurant too. Nice experience overall., December 2018
25,2.0,Mosque and halal food,"I went to Itaewon because many Malaysian travellers recommended this place for the mosque and halal food and because I wanted to try Plant Cafe. The mosque was great - it's located uphill and you can get a view of Seoul from there. However, Itaewon feels and look tacky. Definitely not the best part of Seoul. Not worth visiting again in future, except if I want to eat at Plant Cafe again.", January 2019
26,5.0,"An area with less judgement, more international and the fun is a plus","This is the only area in Korea that the crow are less judgemental towards different race, sexual orientation, or religion. The area attracts all sort of different locals, tourists and expat crowd.", January 2019
27,3.0,Strolling around,Was told this place has good bargains... yes I agree but mostly clothing. Timberland along the main road though is worth visiting for their sale items and maybe a few local restaurants..  you need a translator to enjoy because only a few speak English., November 2018
28,4.0,이태원으로,"There is one famous town named ‘Itaewon’ in the center of Seoul, the capital city of South Korea. This time, I want to recommend one Kebab restaurant in front of Itaewon station. The name of restaurant was ‘Ankara’. So I firstly thought that the capital city of Turkey is Ankara not Istanbul. Anyway the price of Kebab is a bit expensive but I don’t give anyting about the price. Just the taste of it. It tastes really good and It fitted to me. It is a bit spicy and a bit creamy and the lamb.이태원은 내가 가장 좋아하는 서울의 핫플레이스중 하나이다. 필자는 이태원에 가면 항상 들리는 곳이 있는데 그 곳중 하나는 바로 케밥을 파는 가게이다. 이태원 역을 나오면 역 앞에 있는 카페 바로 맞은 편에 자그맣게 차려져 있는 케밥가게를 볼 수가 있다. 가격은 대게 6000원에서 7000원 정도. 이정도 가격이면 내가 자주가는 순대국집에서 맛있는 순대국 한 그릇 정도 먹을 수 있는 가격이지만 그 정도는 개의치 않는다. 케밥을 먹을 수 있다면 말이지.", October 2018
29,3.0,Good area for craft beer,"We visited Itaewon to drink Korean craft beer. We went to Booth and Magpie, both were great. An interesting part of the city.", October 2018
30,5.0,put it on your visit list,"this street along with the area around it is almost international place in Seoul. plenty of small shops for clothes Korean souvenirs  that you can buy ( insure to negotiate about the price). also a lot of restaurants are there especially Arabian, Turkish restaurants. also, I found 2 Arabian groceries for those whom want to buy Arabian meals or products. I would recommend to visit during day time until 8 PM. for families, avoid the area behind the Main Street at night since a lot of bar and adult places are there.", October 2018
31,4.0,Still the international street,"This was the street beloved by US military personnel and their families. Now, most of them have moved to Pyeongtaek and this street is much less crowded. But, still many foreign residents visit here and there are various international shops and restaurants.It's good to visit and have fun at least once.- Most foreign restaurants are too expensive. 15,000 ~ 30,000 won per person normally. I recommend some affordable lunch menus.- Both of Korean and English are available in most places.- Since there's the only mosque in Seoul, it's easy to see Muslims or halal restaurants.- There are many young Korean foodies too.- Very crowded during Itaewon Global Festival in October.- Close to Gyeongnidangil Street(경리단길) or Haebangchon Village(해방촌) that are also popular areas.- There are some romantic rooftop pubs.- Also well-known for super size clothes or military merchandises.", November 2017
32,4.0,Food Fest,I’m not sure if the food stalls is a staple here but it was an awesome atmosphere. Lots of people with great food. The aroma will surely make you hungry, October 2018
33,3.0,It’s ~~ okay,"So I am a Brit who lives in Korea and have been to Itaewon twice. As a place to go shopping it’s great, particularly if you’re a foreigner as they have many shops that cater to taller/larger people and have lots of souvenir shops. It’s so hard to find postcards in Korea but there are tonnes in Itaewon. Also you will almost always find Korean people that speak English here.If you have a couple of hours to kill it’s great. And if you’ve been in Korea long and you want to see lots of foreigners for a change go there.The down side is other than shopping, eating and drinking there’s not really that much to do so if you’re spending more than two hours there it can be a little boring. It’s great for finding foreign cuisines that otherwise you would struggle to find outside of Itaewon and great for the nightlife (if you’re into that).But it’s usually very crowded and when you have lived in Korea for a long time, it can be overwhelming.In general it’s great for shopping and souvenirs, and having a good night out.", October 2018
34,5.0,Subhanallah,"I prayed at Friday Shalat October 5 yesterday. Even though rainy days, jamaah fill the mosque. Imam’s say about Al Ikhlas surah. It’s touching my heart. Subhanallah. Thank you for sympathy for the earthquake in Lombok and Palu, Indonesia", October 2018
35,3.0,Not what it was,Used to have great shopping from numerous small shops selling everything. Now some shops but nothing special. A fair amount of bars and restaurants with great selection of food and drink. We did not feel it was worth the effort to visit but did have a great lunch., October 2018
36,4.0,Best Cheese Pizza Ever,Popularly known as expat area. You can find variety of shops and restaurants serving cuisines from all around the world. Vibrant nightlife. Local Korean brands shopping. It was difficult to get a taxi back to hotel on Saturday night.For cheese pizza lovers i  highly recommend to visit Pizza Revolution., July 2018
37,4.0,It's all about the partying!,I'm not into Itaewon a lot because it's mostly for people who love to party. This is where pub crawls usually happens and the like. One thing I like tho is that this place is near the War Museum of Korea. I should explore this place a lot more when I come back. ;), April 2018
38,3.0,"While it has plenty of bars opened at night, halal food are easy to find too","This area has more foreigners than other part of Seoul does. Many are selling halal food such us Middle Eastern, Indonesian, or Malay food, but there is also one or two restaurant selling halal Korean food (I recommend you going to Eid for halal bulgogi). There are also some halal stores selling halal food but don't expect them to be Korean brand - they are all imported so the price may be higher. Basically Itaewon is good for muslim who are living in Seoul but still needs to perform halal living while nonmuslim can spend night out at bars and restaurants. For tourism, the only thing I can recommend is halal Korean restaurant and the great mosque (even it's not really nice place to visit)", June 2018

41,5.0,Foreigner Central,"The locals call Itaewon ""foreigner central"". You can experience the whole world in this one area. Nightlife here is often considered the best in Korea, but also the most rough.", August 2018
42,5.0,VERY CLEAN!,I absolutely loved walking the streets here.  They were so clean and everyone was so welcoming.  We walked during the morning and the night time.  The streets are lined with great establishments and eateries., July 2018
43,3.0,"A place to get western things, enjoy western dining","Good shops for getting what you miss from back home - wherever back home may be. Grocery stores, size appropriate clothing shops, restaurants, night clubs.", July 2018
44,3.0,Not much happening when we were there ,"First visited 2 years ago with friends and saw different parts in the evening. There are many interesting shops and once we had some beer at an independent brewery and another time we had ice cream in a Turkish cafe. This time when we returned at midday it seemed quiet and lifeless. I liked the greetings in different languages on the pavements but there wasn't much else to enjoy. Perhaps best visiting at night for a lively vibe but Hongdae, Insadong and Myeongdong might be more interesting.", June 2018
45,5.0,International,"People of different nationality coming together, to live, to make a living or just visiting. More international restaurant here then Korean. Be prepared to walking along sloppy roads. Image in the day and night is huge.", June 2018

48,5.0,Worth visit!,"Itaewon is a great place to visit, especially for muslim family, as Mosque and halal restaurant is all around there. Recommended👍🏻", May 2018
49,2.0,Not the best part of Seoul,"I have been dragged to Itaewon a couple of times and for me, it's not very interesting. It looks/feels tacky and it is quite an average part of Seoul, I don't understand the hype here. There are much better places in Seoul to eat and spend your money. Many people are saying it is foreigner friendly, but almost everywhere in Korea is foreigner friendly. The locals do whatever they can to accommodate you. I feel if you come to Korea, you should experience the real Korea and not somewhere that feels like the West/home.", December 2017
50,1.0,Lounge bar called Awesome,"This lounge bar might be changing names- its a big NO.Rip off for tourists- menu and all is in Korean so later on they charge you super high prices they want. They served us a bottle of Australian wine (which is usally an average wine) and charged us 149 US $! After we asked Korean people sitting next to us to translate the menu, we realized that the manager (who is standing in front of the bar) is lying about the prices. With complain from us, he lowered the price on 80 US $, which was still not realistic and too high.", May 2018

52,5.0,Excellent Night Out,"Most of the people have already shared the location, ie behind the hotel- Its easily found out once you reach there.Various watering holes available on various price points. some would try and restrict to create artificial scarcity, some would welcome.  my suggestion try and visit all before settling down on one, rather on first one you see. Totally ignore the ones restricting entry - just fluff - move on to next", October 2017

64,5.0,Great Place To Find Halal Food,"We went here simply because we went to get our lunch as we were told that there were lots of halal diners. True indeed, you can easily spot halal kebabs everywhere from The Sultan Kebabs up to any other small shops selling the same thing. We did have our lunch in one of the kebabs diner. Excellent kebabs, delicious & affordable. We also got to see lots of Malaysians there, maybe because there was a nearby mosque there. Nothing much to see other than that. It is also a walking distance to Leeum Samsung Museum of Art.", December 2017
65,2.0,Did I miss the fun part?,"Not much to do here. Don't go out of your way to come here if you're in Seoul for a week. Lots of bootleg brand names at not very cheap prices. The restaurants around here come in all-sorts of cuisines - albeit culturally mish-mashed and maybe trying a bit too hard without actually getting there. The NZ themed pub served fush n chups and green lipped mussels, but had only one kiwi beer on offer (which they didn't have) alongside Asahi and Hoegarden. If you're in the area and want a chill place for an afternoon drink, recommend the Bungalow pub which has kitschy swing seats and a sand area where you can take off your shoes but apart from that, I didn't find Itaewon very eventful.", August 2017
66,5.0,English Speaking Shop Owners + Interesting Shopping/ Restaurants,"Itaewon is close to former/ existing US army Headquarter. Most shop owners/ keepers command good English for this reason.

68,3.0,Easy to find halal food,"Not exactly my favorite place, I found it to be a little more on the dirty side compared to other places in Seoul.

69,3.0,Skip this place if shopping is your main interest or if you don't have time...........,"This place is full of bars, local & international cafes & restaurants.Every corner you turn, rows & rows of such F&B outlets catches your attention. In fact, there are more F& B than products shops. Noticeably there are also more Westerners ( saw quite a number of military men) here than in other places.If you are the type that likes to mainly shop (& dine local cuisines) in places like Myeongdong, Hongdae, Dongdaemun, Namdaemun & similar- then skip this place.Don't waste your time here. Or unless you have time to kill & have no where else to go. Like us , on the last day in Seoul.We skipped Itaewon in previous visit few years back.You can see from the many pictures that there are not many tourists here as compared to the other mentioned places.An interesting thing about Itaewon station is that it is the only one we have been to so far, that has both a Tourist Information office & a station information counter.

72,5.0,Great Seoul nightlife at reasonable prices........,"I've been coming to Seoul for well over ten years and can remember Itaewon as a rather sleazy area, frequented mainly by GI's given it's proximity to the US Army base at that time. Since the Americans moved out of the city, the area has seen massive development and now hosts a wide choice of bars and restaurants in the area around the Hamilton Hotel on Itaewon itself, and the pedestrian road behind. Most bars are reasonably priced, offering a more affordable option outside of the main tourist hotels. It is the place in Seoul to spend an evening - well worth a visit !", October 2017
73,4.0,Wine and dine,International area for dining and wining. Plenty of bars and restaurants - mid and high end. Lots of small shops as well to do some shopping especially on day time.

78,1.0,Tackiest part of Seoul,"Imagine a place with the most obnoxious and loud tourists (and some other, equally unpleasant 'locals') , tacky aesthetics, ridiculously overpriced restaurants and you get Itaewon.

The one exception is that this is a unique place. The foreigners here will outnumber Koreans. There are some good ethnic restaurants. Ok...I guess if you must, you can visit this unique place to see where you used to go for all things foreign.

86,3.0,Nice area but...,"I understand this is a tourist/expat area but it is also very much known as an international area in terms of culture and food.  That is often a great combination in my experience.  Unfortunately, in Itaewon many(not all of course) of the expats seem to really dumb down the area with a lot of ugly, disrespectful, obnoxious behavior(no need to say where they are from).  I'm all for expats blowing off some steam because I have been one, but I was surprised how rude so many expats were in this area while in the pubs, restaurants and even on the streets.  It's just my experience and opinion but that was disappointing especially since I expected I would love this area.  On the positive side, if one is able to avoid the neanderthals mentioned above, there really is a ton of great little spots for dinner and drink.  Whatever you are craving for food you will find it, from all over the world.  There is a lot of trendy little places as well as a few local food joints if you look. There is also the subway station so it's easy to get to and from.  As a tourist, I would not stay in this area again.  It's just simply not Korea.  I would stay in a different area of Seoul and just visit Itaewon for an evening.  As an expat, this is possibly a good area if craving some western interaction but its not a typical expat area.", June 2017

90,4.0,Tourists as far as the eye can see,"Itaewon is sometimes known as the city where there are more tourists and foreigners than actual Koreans, and I think it's because this place had a military base in the past (Not sure if it's still around now!). If you want to experience the night life in Seoul, this is probably the best place to be. From K-beauty brands to foreign goods (like Nike and Adidas), this place has got it all. There are also plenty of drinking places, pubs, and hole-in-the-wall restaurants that cater to every foreigner's tastes. I saw a Halal Guys, a Turkish delight dessert cafe, and steakhouses to name a few.

It reminded of a small town in east coast USA. We strolled on the main drag, and all the side alley in between... the shops, restaurant and cafes. It was like an international market in one place; an array of restaurants like Thai, Vietnamese, French, Italian, Middle Eastern, Japanese, Chinese, Philippines, American Diner to name a few.

Souvenir goods are a bit pricey by 1000 to 2000 KRW if compared to those you can get in Myeongdong area, but in terms of variety and aesthetic preference, Itaewon shopping area is a lot better. Also safe for female solo travelers - I went there alone. Lots of families and couples are around to shop.

I had heard that it was a fun, eclectic, international area, but I found it to be overly rowdy and much less interesting than other districts. As an American, I was embarrassed by the loud (even shouting!) U.S. tourists on the long side streets and unimpressed by the restaurant offerings. It seemed to attract people who wanted the experience of Seoul, but didn't want to actually go out and explore the city. Lots of tacky older couples and older teenagers.

The area behind the Hamilton Hotel is filled with fun pums and restaurants that ared shared between all. The night life here is vibrant and fun. Just people watching while you grab a cold one is a blast. Now if you cross the other side of the street there are still some seedy places, particularly on the hill behind the fire station. Juicy bars still remain as do transgender bars which demonstrate the changing times in Korea. One can stll shop for cheap stuff along the main drag of Itaewon-ro and its side alleys if that is your thing, but I would recommend the trendy side of the street mentioned above.

202,1.0,"Itaewon nightspots discriminate against non-whites, ban foreigners over MERS","Despite the fact that Itaewon is a very multicultural area and has retained a lot of it's diversity even as it has gotten an image upgrade over the past few years, with an exponentially increasing number of trendy bars and restaurants, this gentrification has also brought an increasing amount of discrimination. Kangnam style meeting Itaewon Freedom (a lesser known music video that came from Korea before Kangnam Style - see it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N8c1t1QTDI) has meant that moneyed younger Koreans who are flocking to Itaewon are drawn largely because they think of it as an exotic foreign Disneyland. But this trend hasn't exactly brought with it a sense of ""globalization"" (a really popular word in Korea) - a real sense of ope-mindedness to foreigners. Many nightlife places in Itaewon routinely discriminate against foreigners, residents and travellers.The most recent case was club which recently started refusing entry to all foreigners. The first article which appeared this past week is here (http://www.koreaobserver.com/club-in-itaewon-denies-entry-to-foreigners-especially-those-from-middle-east-33961/) This was the original article that appeared about this issue... The real heart of the issue could actually be worse, and is explained in another article below... But the background to this speaks volumes about the ignorance, hypocrisy, xenophobia and closed-mindedness that pervades a country that claims to be ""globalized.""Basically the article explains how foreigners were banned entry except for friends and acquaintances because of trouble some people have caused in the past. The  ""door policy"" sounds very typical for many of the newer clubs in the Itaewon area that are popular with Koreans...they use the excuse that they reserve the right to refuse entry at any time to anyone... Just like the article says, this applies to anyone who ""doesn't fit the club's image""... In effect, this is used to prevent people of African, South Asian and Middle Eastern origin from entering (ostensibly because they are the ones who cause trouble - and there is at least some truth to this) while white patrons are usually fine.... But if you happen to be Westerner of the non-white persuasion, (like me) you are very far from ""fitting the club's image"", and I have had problems getting at this particular club and others, unless I'm with some white friends who can legitimize me...There are no laws against discrimination on the basis of race in Korea, and such ""entrance policies are also found in other nightlife areas in Seoul such as Kangnam and the area around Hongik University (this article explains more: http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2988812), as well as other nightlife venues in cities across Korea. Articles such as these appear fairly commonly in English media.In this case, the real heart of the issue is explained in a second article, where the manager of the club explicitly says that he banned all foreigners because his customers are afraid of catching MERS. The article is here: (http://www.koreaobserver.com/club-in-seoul-bans-entry-to-foreigners-over-fears-of-mers-34351/) - if you read it you can see his explanation in his own words (he also repeats the justification that he is entitled to do this because some non-Western foreigners have caused trouble in the past.) This is not the first time this has happened - last year a very popular bar (and one of the diminishing number of truly mixed nightspots) banned all African patrons because of fears over Ebola AT THE REQUEST OF KOREAN PATRONS. This bar is co-owned by a Korean and an expat. It reached the Western media (http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/signs-s-korean-pub-bans-africans-article-1.1907500) but to be fair in this case the owners quickly apologized and tried to set things right.  That has not been the case with this most recent incident. There is no official response from the Korea National Tourism Organization, the Seoul Metropolitan Government, or the Itaewon Special Tourism Zone about any of these matters. As a resident of Korea, what bothers me most is how many Korean people coming to Itaewon (a supposed sign of how open-minded they are) accept this kind of discrimination, with the refain that ""this is Korea."" It IS a part of life here, it IS a part of the cultural thinking (for a variety of historical and social reasons.) But still, I have to wonder how many people actually share these feelings (as opposed to those who accept it without really thinking of questioning it.) How many of the young adults that I teach might feel this way? It bothers me to think that even a few might - not knowing how many share the kind of thinking that has lead to this status quo is one the most unsettling questions I have had in all my years in Korea.", July 2015

205,5.0,You can feel the world in Seoul : Itaewon,"Itaewon is the most attractive place that I have been to recently. There are mainly three reasons why I think Itaewon is the best place ever. They are location, various entertainments, and various atmospheres.    First, the location is very excellent. There are a lot of transportation and it is convenient to access. Thus, you can easily go to Itaewon from anywhere by various subways and buses. Moreover, because Itaewon is located in the center of Seoul, you can move easily and quickly to anywhere in Seoul from Itaewon. There is Namsan Mountain in the north and Gangnam in the south. You can go to Namsan Mountain if you want to feel the fresh air of nature, or you can go to Gangnam if you want to enjoy a luxury of city. In addition, there are some parks near Itaewon. For this reason, despite the Itaewon is an entertainment district, the air is quite refreshing.    Second, the entertainment is varied. Diversity is the biggest attraction in Itaewon. Even if you have never been to travel abroad, you can feel the world in Seoul. Embassies from all over the world are located in Itaewon. As a result, there are many traditional restaurants of the world. In particular, the Greek restaurant that is called 'El Grecos' offers traditional Greek food very well, and ‘Gyros’ that I ate in ‘El Grecos’ is the most memorable meal for me. In addition to this, you will also be able to taste the food that you can’t eat often, such as Turkish, Brazilian foods. Besides, there are many traditional costumes as well as food from around the world, so you will be able to easily get unique items. In addition, because the people of various countries are gathered, there are now a wide variety of pubs and bars in Itaewon catering to all tastes.     Third, the atmosphere is different for each area. Near the main street, there are many gorgeous and splendid shops. Especially, I want to recommend ‘the glamping’. In this store, you may be satisfied with the atmosphere in this store. The interior of the restaurant is decorated like a luxurious camping. When you eat the food surrounded by camping supplies, you may feel a sense of freedom as a real camping. And below the main street, there are quiet and secluded stores that are not crowded. Lastly, to the upper direction from the main street, there are charming alleys. There are some unusual and exotic shops hidden in these alleys. Therefore, you can choose to go anywhere depending on your favors. For these reasons, I recommend Itaewon to anyone who want to enjoy feel the global cultures in Seoul.", March 2015

207,4.0,Needless to say it was an experience we won’t soon forget.,"We rushed home to get ready for another night of fun. Lidia decided to stay home this time because she couldn’t keep up with our party life. While waiting for our friend Tom to arrive, we decided to go downstairs to grab a quick bite and pre-drink. My partner, however, forgot the Wi-Fi hotspot upstairs which we needed to contact Tom. Most of the door locks in Seoul are passcode protected. No knocking or keys required. We thought it was a really cool and nifty feature. Big mistake. As soon as the door unlocked we saw my best friend running in the bluff towards the restroom exposing her backside. What she failed to realize while running towards the restroom was that the closet in front of the restroom also had a full-length mirror. Yeah. We quickly grabbed the Wi-Fi and ran out of there all knowing never to speak of this event again.After a few train rides we arrived in Itaewon, also known as the melting pot of diversity of South Korea. Foreigners from all over the world transcend to the area to meet and party with other foreigners and locals alike. The U.S. military is also stationed here so it was nice to sporadically hear English.As I was waiting for my partner to use the restroom, I started walking around the corner and got startled as a woman popped out of the doorway gesturing me to “come here” to her. I immediately thought “what the hell” and kept walking. Another man walked by the doorway, but this time a completely different woman popped out saying “good time?” Ladies and gentleman, I was standing next to a brothel. It was a never-ending cycle throughout my 10 minutes of waiting. After Vu was finally done, things got weirder. A heavy-set woman, obviously drunk on the ground across from the brothel, kept telling my boyfriend and I “you guys are so sexy. You want to see my d!#$?

Itaewon was full of many different shops that were owned by people from diverse countries as well as the products. We didn't have much time to look around in most of the shops, but it would have been enjoyable if we did. We went to My Chi Chi's for lunch, which had mainly Italian food, but also fusion of other different countries. We ordered a pizza, spaghetti, and two main meals which contained chicken and salad. The food was good, but did not meet my expectations. I think the price was well set although it was a bit expensive. However, I would go to another restaurant if I visit Itaewon again.", May 2015
210,4.0,First Time of My Life In Itaewon,"From the first moment of the day when I received the parental consent form of the trip to Itaewon, located in Seoul, I was extremely excited. I felt happy that I actually got a fantastic opportunity to learn new things about other cultures in the world. Since I already knew briefly about the place, I expected myself to eat foreign food like Mexican, or Turkish, etc...And in the reality, me and the other 5 grade 10 boys had an awesome scavenger hunt there in Itaewon, after the arrival and some brief explanations by the teachers. Together, we saw many things, and met many foreigners while we walked around. We saw lots of foreign food, clothes, masks, signs that were written in foreign languages, and people who were not talking in English. Me and the other boys had a very pleasant meal in a Turkish Restaurant Pasha. I had chicken chops and Turkish drink tamek, Tamek was an attractive drink, Maybe I can have it next time, if there's some time for me in the future,There, I was fascinated by a unique Turkish sauce and the taste of it. And also, I felt delighted that the workers in Pasha were very kind to us. We asked some questions in the scavenger hunt, and every time, the men offered the answer with so much kindness. For that, we appreciated them. I still remember their smiling faces, and their words that they didn't get any discriminations while living in Korea, and that Koreans like kebab a lot.I personally hope for more experiences which I might have next time, Any way, I felt happy this time, since my school CMIS provided this valuable chance to all of the seniors of the school.", May 2015

221,4.0,A little disappointing,"Although we were fully aware that it is the 'international' part of Seoul, we were still overall disappointed.  The 'antique street' was full of British knock offs and the 'fashion street' had little in the way or fashion and many overpriced shops.  The main street was OK and I did get a great jacket made for $300-.  But most of the shops were again of poor quality.  The food street is however, really good and we went back a few times", December 2014

The gym itself was very basic with uneven floor but has a power rack and a bar bell, and two bench presses. The male toilet has no hand basin but a hose. You pay 8k won per casual visit.

223,4.0,Bustling multicultural district,"Itaewon is known as the ""international"" neighborhood of the city, thanks in part to its proximity to the nearby US Army Yongsan Garrison. As such, this is easily the area where you will meet the most foreigners (US troops, but now mostly, tourists, or foreigners who came to live in Korea). The area also seems to have a fairly large African and Middle Eastern community. So Itaewon is your go-to destination for international or fusion cuisine. However, there is one word that describes this neighborhood : ""uneven"". On one hand, Itaewon offers a bustling nightlife, a multicultural environment, and a lot of concept bars or other trendy and completely unexpected establishments. It has become a party center for Korea's nouveau riche and trendy youth. On the other hand, it is sometimes shady, with its poorly lit backstreets, its small stores that sell kitsch/low-brow items, and its tiny low end end restaurants, only meters away from trendy establishments. Also, it lacks the authenticity of Hongdae or even Gangnam. Still, Itaewon probably ranks amongst the Top 3 nightlife districts in Seoul", November 2014

Itaewon is an all-round district: shopping, club scene, hookers, restaurants, places of worship, etc. Seoul and very close to Hannam Village, where I lived with my family. Prices are higher, since it's in the heart of Seoul and very touristy. Better prices are found at the Moons (Nandemoon, Tandemoon, etc.) or Osan. But if you're in Seoul for a short trip, you can find everything in Itaewon. They make really good fake Coach or any name brand purses but they hide them behind the counters because they aren't supposed to sell a non-numbered purse. When they know you're serious about buying, they will bring out the numbered purses. Itaewon and most of the shopping districts aren't very sanitary (sewage problems, debris, dirty bathrooms, etc.) but if you're game, you can find very good deals and also talk the price down. It really is a shopping haven where you can get suits, boots, bedding, etc. tailor-made,.They really want to make a sale so walk away if it sounds too high and you might get a better deal, there or somewhere else. Need comfy shoes to walk and try taking public transportation, since driving and parking is a nightmare.

Here?!! Somebody told us about the shop when we talked and she explained us how to go to there. Yes!! what we want it??!! we found them at the shop and we were suprised because all of clothes were from UK and Germany plus America. And the clothes were very biggest and tallest size. who had seen the size like a 10 XL in Korea?? There were size large to 10XL. We couldnt believe that but when I put on the cloth, I noticed that it was big. So we bought many clothes there. the shop keepper gave us the german costmetics. we're so happy. because we had got a refund of the VAT of tax in the incheon airport. we had good impression about the shop's name was the Unique Shop and she gave us gifts and Korea gave us to get back to the tax.

241,3.0,"If you're shopping, bargaining is the key","If you're shopping in Itaewon, bargaining is the key. You can find almost everything you need and don't need, from Gangnam socks to tailor-made suits, and if you're a guy, you will be asked at least 5 times if you need a suit. There are a lot of designer knock-offs to peruse bags, wallets, scarves, clothes, etc., but not even quality knock-offs. Itaewon is where the expat community shops and you can definitely see both expats and tourists shopping in this area. There is a vibrant nightlife within the restaurants and bars. I also noticed several US soldiers in the area. If visiting Seoul again, I wouldn't come here. I'd rather shop at Insadong, but if I were living in Seoul as an expat, I can see how I would frequent Itaewon. The one thing that I found in Itaewon that was a pleasant surprise was a pie shop in an alleyway. They had every American pie that you can think of. I had to have the strawberry rhubarb pie.

Recommended and ranked on the top of TripAdvisor & we know we can't missed this. (read my blog for more details on directions & pricing) It was one of the best beef Sirlion I ever tasted! Must try if you're in the vicinity. Shopping wise: There's a famous shop that does customised luggage tag at the basement opposite Burger King. It's quite prominent where it displays the unique tags right outside. Be preapred to wait if you're doing a bulk as he makes on the spot. I think tourist should do as he can customised your name into Korean words & choose your fav. logo/cartoon etc. Go check it out!You can read more on the cafes I visited here, http://jacqsowhat.blogspot.sg/2013/08/seoul-korea-day-5-yeouido-hangang-park.html", April 2013

Traditional Korean restaurants are great, but, especially if you are a vegetarian, culinary variety is a great thing and that's what you will find in Itaewon.  Be sure to look up (and down!) while you roam the streets; there are hidden gems everywhere!  They really have a skill at using every cm of space available here.  There's quite a bit of shopping to do in Itaewon, too.Word of advice if you are planning to stay in the area... Find a place that you won't mind walking to/from.

261,5.0,The heart of Seoul,"Itaewon is an area that is a must see.  Muslims will go here at least for the Friday prayers as Seouls only mosue is located here.  If you are after seriously good food, exit at No. 3 at Itaewon station.  As you emerge from the underground, a mouth-watering aroma of grilled meat hit you...and you just know its halaal! I do not recall the places name, but on the right to the stairs is a Turkish restaurant. It's small, and quite busy at times, but bide your time.  The wrap ha is sold there is heaven-sent, and the owner is very friendly too.  He speaks english, Turkish, and Korean. It's cost effective and filling, and the cokes are sold at locl prices (not hotel prices).The Area is generally trendy, and you would do well to stroll down the streets and look onto ech of the shops. Don't get caught by insistent shopkeepers for you to come in.  I found that in some cases, if you even just looked in their direction, it was an invitation for them to launch a sales battle on you. If you search for wifi, you can pick up free wifi in some areas. The trade offers clothing, food, shoes, a number of bargain shops and is worth the sore feet and dedicated afternoon in the area. We kept on coming back here for the Turksh wrap...it was that good! Oh, and it's across the street from Baskin Robins.", September 2012
262,3.0,"""Itaewon....aka....The Twilight Zone""","If you want a real taste of Korea DONT GO TO ITAEWON!We went to Itaewon to eat at a specific Indian restaurant the ""Foreigner Restaurant"" (named appropriately for that area in my opinion) and a bit of shopping & have NO desire to ever go back. The restaurant was ok not the best indian we have ever had but decent. If you have a desire for things Korean this is not the place for you it is totally Americanized. Granted there are people from ALL places of the world there it still felt like we were in America & not Korea. We had heard quite a bit about Itaewon therefor were excited to check it out, but sadly it was a disappointment. The BEST part of the day happened to us on chance (the ONLY reason I give Itaewon 3 instead of a 2) & saved the day. After eating we just walked down the main street when getting off the subway just to see what it was like & were talking about getting back on the subway to go to another part of Seoul when all of the sudden there were these stairs....so we went exploring. WOW were we happy we did that! Beautiful city views w/ a mountain feel. After 1 set of stair we we up a second set & walked the mountain. We crossed over a bridge to the park & it was amazing! With the fog it completely felt like we were hiking in the Smokey Mountains but in Korea.  It ended up being a wonderful day.If you are a family or someone who wants to really enjoy what it is to be in Korea this is NOT a place for you. Also if your looking to shop this is NOT the place for you. Go to the Namdaemun Market or the Gangnam Underground Shopping Arcade where you will get way more choices at way way better prices. They a very pricey in Itaewon because its a tourist trap. I bought a pair of shorts I saw in Itaewon for 10,000 Won at the market for only 5,000!!!! Same things with like the chopstick, my daughter wanted this pack of chopsticks that in Itaewon were 10,000KW & we got the SAME 1s for 5,000KW at the market. Now if you are someone who wants to party & feel like you are in the States then this place is for you.I think if you have a limited time in Seoul don't go here it is a waste of time, but if you are in Seoul for a extended amount of time hey go check it out just to say you've been to Itaewon.", July 2013

I enjoyed my time is Seoul and everywhere I went. There are restaurants everywhere - just like most places in Seoul, and lots of places to shop - although like most other places the items start to repeat themselves.The one thing I didnt like about this area was that it seemed like a ""tourist trap"" to me. Its known to have international food and foreigner friendly - which it was, but everything seemed to be priced higher than other areas like namdaemun, Insadong, yeongdeungpo underground shopping, etc. And honestly, there are most the same products as these other places. I would recommend going there just because you are in Seoul and of course you want to see a lot of places - but don't expect too much different.

Rightly so.this neighborhood is an experience, a nice place to hang out..but,for us, not for a short first trip..for a longer trip with days to spare it would work better.We came here primarily to visit the International Clinic..a find if you need medical check ups, someone to administer vaccines/shots(like us, 40,000 won, very professional,English speaking)..get an appointment through their website first.Someone tipped us that you could walk from itaewon to a part of the Han river in around 20minutes,we didn't do it though..so can't say for sure.We ate at a Turkish restaurant called Pasha..excellent bread, excellent food.highly recommended.", March 2013

The downside is it is also a bit more dangerous than other areas of Seoul. I'm not sure what is the cause of this but everyone I knew especially single females avoided itaewon at night alone. Be careful and you'll have a good time there., May 2012
273,4.0,Halal Food can easily be found here,"Itaewon is the area that easily can be found Halal food. There is lots of restaurants with variety of foods selections i.e. from Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Korea etc..Here also can be found Moslem shops with Halal groceries, hijab clothes, bakery and many more. For Moslem, its so easy to perform prayer hence there is a huge and beautiful mosque/masjid. Combination of modern city with people from different country, language, religion, food...this is Itaewon!", October 2012
274,5.0,Best Place in Korea,"Things that i don't really like from Korea is Korean people not really speak English.. But, in Itaewon area, is like expat heaven.. Makes me easy to ask direction ;p .. Lot of restaurant in that area with amazing taste.. if you don't really like Korean food, i recommend TUCAN, Jamaican restaurant. Jerk Chicken in that place so AWESOME!!", November 2012
275,5.0,Best place for moslem,"For moslem, there's no place that so comfortable like itaewon, you can pray here at the seoul center mosque, beautiful mosqe, buy things at halal supermarket, and also eat at a lot of moslem restaurant here, Islamic book store, moslem clothes...anything...Feels like home....", February 2013
276,4.0,fruit salad,"As a Seoul resident, I make regular trips to Itaewon for everything I could need. Foreign foods of all kinds, western sized clothes and shoes, hair appointments, doctors, beauty, bars, English books, and even a local sauna. It's a must visit for anyone spending a longer amount of time in Korea. This is not a Korean experience, it's an international one.", February 2013
277,4.0,Foreign haven,"Itaewon has long been the place in Seoul where foreigners gather to eat their own cuisine, admittedly with a Korean twist, shop for ingredients for their home cooking and generally just get together with other expatriates.For a long time Itaewon had a rather unsavory reputation, serving as a clubbing scene more than anything else, and the clubs are still there, serving up indie and pop music side-by-side, but recently a renovation has taken place, and upmarket coffee shops, boutique hotels and gourmet restaurants have taken over.The main attraction for me is Itaewon Spa Land, situated on the top of the hill, and reached via a staircase that seems to go on forever! Once at the top, you have the choice of just using the sauna facilities, or having the whole 'jimjilbang' experience, where you get given a floppy set of shorts and T-shirt to wear when entering the communal areas.If you've never experienced a Korean sauna, this is quite a good one to start with. The bath area on the second floor has showers, a massage area, and several pools at different temperatures and with differing herbal infusions in which to soak. There is also a steam room and a sauna. The male and female sections are separate here, but on the third, fourth and fifth floors there are communal areas, including a restaurant, a charcoal oven sauna, massage chairs and TV's, and an exercise area. All this for less than 10000 won makes it real value for money.Once you're scrubbed and clean and relaxed, drop in at the Foreign Market, where you'll find food from Malaysia, India, South Africa, America, Italy and other climes. This is where you can find ingredients that are not in regular Korean shops, such as herbs and spices, semolina flour, oats etc.And of course, finally you can drop in at Turkish, Italian, South African, Greek and many other specialised cuisine restaurants.", February 2013
278,5.0,Amazing Spot!,"This place is packed full of restaurants (check behind the Hamilton Hotel--alleys of bars, pubs, and restaurants).  It caters to a lot of international travelers, and having said that, you can find not only local Korean dishes, but international cuisine as well.  Take some time and hop from place to place and try all the great food and drinks!  You won't be disappointed! The main street has plenty of spots to buy souvenirs.  It is one of the stops for the Seoul City Bus Tour, as well.  You can get here via subway--get off at Itaewon.  Itaewon is great great great!", February 2013

281,3.0,Both Bargans and Rip Offs,"Iteawon is probably the most touristy of all the Seoul shopping districts. It caters to US military personal and their familys as well as forigen tourists from all over the world.  It is of course a gaurentee that anytime you have a large number of tourists in a given area there will always be folks there to rip them off and this district is certinly no exception.However, thats not to say that there are no bargans here because there are indeed some great bargans to be had as well, you just have to be careful who you deal with. I was told by a local who has lived here all of her life that the best way to weed out the crooks is to stay away from the ones who come out onto the street and try to lure you into their shop's with the promise of a fantastic bargan.  The very reputable shop owners who have been there for many years and built up a solid reputation do not have to resort to those tactics, so seek out one of the quiet unassuming little shops where the owner is patiently waiting inside his or her store rather than outside on the street ""barking"" at tourists for the best quality items.", December 2012
282,5.0,Great place to shop,"I went to this place upon recommendation from my friend.This is a great place to shop. Apart from them obvious sight of many merchants there, the landscape changes as dusk approaches. In the day time, shops open normally starting from 0900hrs. However as time goes by, street carts start their business and the vibrancy of the entire area lifted by another notch. Eateries, cafes and restaurants offer rest for tired feet after shopping and there are so many situated around the entire shopping belt which ensures that shopping can continue excitingly after a recharge.Getting there is easy by subway, though I find that taxis are not that expensive as well. Overall a great experience, my wife and two kids were shopping there from 1030hrs till 1700hrs.", December 2012
283,4.0,Party!  and good shopping as long as you can haggle with them.,I was stationed at Yongsan for 1.5 years. Itaewon is a great party. Plenty of clubs to go to. I Djed at a few of the clubs. Not sure if they are still there but it is a good time for younger people. Will be full of US Military personell and I met people from all over the world. The shopping is good too make sure you haggle a bit as they will all go down in price everytime if you start to walk away., January 2012
284,3.0,"Great Nightlife, But Beware of Drunk GI's","We had fun partying it up with expats and locals alike at the many bars and nightclubs in this area.  Unfortunately, we also witnessed a number of GI's obnoxiously drunk- two of them were actually in a fist fight in the street.  I could only hang my American head in shame.", October 2012
285,2.0,Many foreigners and the American army,"If you like American soldiers and many foreigners than this is a part you will like. It is a small area in Seoul, difficult to reach by the subway. There is nothing to see or to do. There are bars, restaurants and coffee shops like every where in seoul. But the ares is a little", November 2012
286,2.0,mostly for tourists,"you can skip this area, certainly not for shopping, which is better done in Meyondong. Hardly a 1km of shops, where you can notice westerns at last.", October 2012
287,4.0,Good shopping for western fare,"If you are shopping for souvenirs or Western apparel, Itaewon has a good selection of cheap clothes, backpacks, etc.  If your looking for authentic Korean shopping, there are other places around Seoul that provide a better experience.  You'll see a lot of expats and Soldiers", November 2011
288,5.0,It has shrugged off its bad image and now its filled with nice pubs and restaurants.,"Itaewon used to have a pretty bad reputation, being filled with American sailors and known to be a little bit dangerous and rowdy. But that has changed in the recent years and now it's bustling with some nice restaurants, bars and shops. A friend just opened a bar called Bar", July 2012
