8,4.0,Best experience,"It has fresh air and clear blue sky. I really enjoyed the moment there. You can go there by subway to World Cup Stadium Station and walk about 1 kilometres to Haneul Park. You can choose shuttle bus and pay about KRW 5,000 for round trip or just walk by the upstairs to the destination. It was good experience!!!", October 2019
9,4.0,"Silver Grass, Flowers etc",, October 2019
10,4.0,Often known as Sky Park,"Visit this park for views of the river, city and football stadium. The area was a land fill turned into an attractively landscaped hill.  It is a popular destination especially when its tall grasses seed and turn red. The hill top has a cafe and toilets. The staircase serving the hill features 291 steps, so bare that in mind when you start to climb it.", October 2019
11,4.0,Worth the climb,"Instagram brought us here! The park is huge, from the size of it, probably 90% is filled with silvergrass and the rest is pink muhly grass and kochia. We arrived early in the morning and had to walk around 20 minutes from World Cup station to reach the foot of the hill. There are 3 options to reach the top, by tram, stairs or hill climb. We opted for stairs and get down by hill. There was silvergrass festival during my trip but it wasnt fully bloom yet. Pink muhly grass on the other hand was blooming perfectly but the land plot for pink muhly is too small hence huge crowd. Overall experience, we had great time here", October 2019
12,5.0,Silver & Pink Grass,, October 2019
13,4.0,Nice place,Interesting at the top with the grass  land and good views of Seoul.   Noticed long lines for the shuttle to the top.   Not sure why so many waiting for shuttle.   You could walk to top in less time than in line.  And there is a gradual road to top if you want to avoid stairs., September 2019
14,4.0,Good in October,"I visited here at the end of September this year and in October of last year. I went to see the pink Muhly grass and the silver grass. It was pretty but not as full at the end of September thus I recommend going in October as I went last year - the silver grass was blooming then at that time. Overall, nice views from up there. One time we hiked up, the other time we took the trolly ride. It costs 3,000 won one way. Avoid going on the weekend, if you can, as it is packed then. Weekdays are much better.", September 2019
15,3.0,Its just another park.,"To be honest, its just another park. It will serve as a good location for wedding photoshoot but I can't think of another reason to go there and walk under the hot sun. It provides good vantage points overlooking seoul and the world cup stadium but thats about it. Not much variety of flora or fauna too.", September 2019
16,5.0,Beautiful Park,I went there summer time so the silver grass are not showing. But overall the park is beautiful and refreshing because it’s in higher location., May 2019
17,4.0,Nice field,We went mid May and the grass was knee-high. Very important to check when the grass is scheduled for cutting or else you risk missing out on the pretty backdrop.  There ware signages about FROGS so beware if you ware one like me who gets creeped out by them.  Very important to enter at the base of the hill and not anywhere else... why? because that's where you can ride the buggy up the hill instead of treading 950meters UPHILL :)  Trust me you will want to ride it ;), May 2019
18,5.0,Great scenery park,"To reach this park, we walked from World Cup Stadium Station to the base of this mountain and climb up by the stairs. After sweat a bit you will see a great tall grass field and nice view of Seoul opposite the Han river from the top of mountain. This park is good to visit before winter. We were there in the end of November and saw they started cutting the grass.", November 2018

20,5.0,Commending great city scenery park,, October 2018
21,5.0,A great find,"This place is beautiful before the winter season. However, you can still get to see some tall grasses after the winter season. The shuttle is worth paying if you do not plan to hike the whole way to the top of the park.", March 2019
22,5.0,"Nice park, great views","If you are interested in relaxing on a weekend or getting in some exercise, this may be your place.  If you hike up the nearly 1000 steps to the top, you get a great view of the Han River, Yoido, Seoul, etc.  (You can also walk on the trail — more steps but less steep).   Several bike trails, jogging trails, etc.   Enjoy the flower gardens and hanging squash tunnel.", August 2018
23,4.0,Go at the right season,"It was quite a journey to get to the top but I bet the view was worth it on a perfect season. Unfortunately for us, the place was barren the time we went (March 2018 to be exact)", April 2018
24,5.0,Beautiful golden afternoon,"We burned calories and leg muscles getting to the top, but it was worth it.  The Eulalia glowing in the setting sun was spectacular.", November 2018

26,5.0,Another beautiful scenery in the middle of metropolitan city,"Despite being a metropolitan city, Seoul has a lot place with beautiful scenery they can offer. And this one is definitely one of it. Though it can be slightly a little bit tiring since you have to climb a lot of stairs before you reach the so called Haneul Park (Literally means Sky Park). But once you reach the end of the stairs and found this little paradise on the top of the hill, then you really feel like you're in heaven. For the best time, you might want to come here during autumn~! They have the best view in autumn~!", October 2018
27,4.0,Family tour in Korea,Haneul Park is a good park to enjoy and relax only after you climbed a series of ladders going to the top.A good exercise.

31,4.0,Great View,, December 2018
32,5.0,A beautiful garden in autumn ,"The park was quite big and well maintained.  It was accessible by subway; close to World Cup Stadium Station.  After a 10 mins walk from subway station, there are over a few hundreds steps to climb to the peak of the park.  There is also a shuttle to take visitors to the peak at a small fee. The garden was especially beautiful in autumn, with different types of plants of distinct colours, such as Eulalia grass, pink muhly grass etc.  Highly recommend to visit in the morning if you want to take nice pictures.", October 2018

It's right next to Seoul World Cup statdium, however you have to walk around it to find the way going to the park.  We hiked up the hill which isn't so bad and took the tram going down.  This is a must when you are in Seoul, it's amazing view is breathtaking.  It was a dumpster back in the days and was reclaimed to commemorate the World Cup in early 2000.  A must see in Seoul!", November 2017
44,4.0,"Garden in the Sky, a sight to see",, October 2018
45,4.0,Silver Glass session,"It silver glass session, so we decide to pay a visit here. I suggest take the tram/electric golf cart go up to the hill. Just a small price for it. But if you want to enjoy the night view, then you have to walk down as the tram last stop is 6pm. Quite a long walk from the nearest MRT station but worth it as my country don't have this.", October 2018
46,5.0,Best park in Seoul,"About 15 minutes walk from World Cup Stadium, the park was huge and located on a hill which required a hike passed 291 steps. It was so beautiful during late autumn with silver grass and cosmos. We walked to the end of the road to watch Seoul from the other side.

47,5.0,Very crowded on weekend,, October 2018
48,5.0,Land of Silver Grass,The long walk from subway station & climbing 700 meters stairs totally worth it !

49,5.0,I guess you should go in the Fall,"I came here in the spring of 2015 and after climbing those 200+ steps, I was so disappointed that everything was cut down and ugly. I made such a great effort to come here, after just getting over the flu the day before.  After reading reviews, apparently the best time to come is in the Fall.  I will definitely make it back here one day when it is more picturesque.  The little brick pathway with the trees on the sides was still pretty even though the fields were not.", August 2017
50,4.0,Epic history,"A long walk up the 200+ steps but great views. Did you know that this used to be the Nanji-do garbage dump for west Seoul? On a hot day, you can still smell it faintly. The methane gas is captured and used to produce the electricity for the nearby World Cup Stadium park.Great food trucks in the neighborhood in the evenings too.", May 2018
51,5.0,A Place that Everyone Visiting Seoul Should go to!,"Haneul Garden is easily one of the biggest and best outdoor attractions in Seoul. It takes about 30-40 minutes to walk to from the subway station (and the walk is uphill, although on a road, so a little fitness is required). However, the view and gardens themselves are well worth the walk. Any season, Haneul will be amazing. Further, every side of the garden offers a new and unique view of Seoul.", September 2017
52,4.0,A great park to go to during Autumn,Haneul Sky Park  (하늘공원)  is the most popular park situated in the World Cup Park and is best to go to during Autumn where Eulalia ( Miscanthus sinensis) blooms. It’s a very nice place to get those Instagram worthy picture, October 2017

I was pleasantly surprised at the beauty, ease of hiking, and facilities within the park. The view was simply amazing! We took the stairs up and walked down the path. I would recommend that you walk the path that's lined by trees/forest on both sides. It was a beautiful path. At the top of the Foothill (after working up 260+ steps), you walk up few more steps, and you're presented with beautiful prairie and various walking paths as well as the observation deck. This is great place to visit, and it's free!!!!", November 2016
72,4.0,"Lovely views, flowers and foliage in the fall.","We spent a few hours walking in this lovely urban setting. Even in the third week of October, the cosmos were in full bloom and the eulalia grasses looked great. However, on this specific Saturday it was crowded and noisy, so maybe a weekday would be more relaxed. Be ready for a lot of stair climbing and paths with moderately steep inclines. Great panoramic view over the city.", October 2016
73,5.0,Must go!,, October 2016
74,5.0,Breathtaking ,"This park was beautiful. A true hidden treasure is the heart of Seoul. First you have about a 15 to 25 minute walk to the top of the hill. There is a place to by drinks and snacks at the top. Once you arrive you will soon see endless fields of flowers, tall grasses, light tunnels and a large bowl structure that you can climb inside of. It's essentially a large maze that's perfect for taking photos. You can also see some great views of Seoul. You can easily see Namsan Tower and the nearby World Cup Stadium. I highly recommend this park!", October 2016
75,5.0,So close yet so far from the city,"In the middle of 2002's World cup village, this park built on a landfill is just an incredible place to spend the afternoon, walking around the fields, with an incredible view of the city.

There are different ways to get up to the top.  You may either climb the 290 steps, hiking or take the buggy for KW5000 per person (2-way trip).   The highlights during the Fall season at Haneul Park or aka Sky Park are the enormous Eulalia grass aka silver grass across the park.

86,4.0,Amazing View,"The long walk up the park was not my favorite part, but I can say that it was worth it. I really loved that you can see the Han River and the city from the park. It was autumn when I was there and walking around was really a joy because it was not hot. The park was also big enough, so even if there were a lot of people, there is space for everyone. If not walking up to the park and walking down is not your thing, I think there is a shuttle that can bring you to the park but for a fee.", November 2014
