0,3.0,Meh,It has a lot of information but it is kind of boring. The audio guides didn't work properly and there are no numbers to indicate what you are seeing. So you are stuck walking around looking at dioramas and reading texts. The kids were engaged for the first 15 minutes then lost, January 2020
1,4.0,"Good museum, wish there was more from the past 80 years","I visited this museum with my wife, who grew up in Seoul, and my teenage daughters. The main museum is a large but manageable single floor. The museum is worth a 1 to 2 hour visit.Seoul's history spans centuries so it is hard to cover everything. It includes how Seoul became the national capital and its evolution to what it is today. The Japanese occupation is prominently featured. I learned a lot, and it was helpful to have the audio guide even though in many cases the explanations consisted of summaries of the placards already posted.I was hopeful to see more of what happened to Seoul during the Korean War. There was very little included. In addition, while the rapid changes experienced since the war are covered, it would have been interesting to have more detail on how Seoul has evolved decade by decade.That said, Seoul's history is so long and action-packed that it would be impossible to cover everything.", December 2019
2,4.0,Good small museum ,I thought this was great.  It is filed with interesting and very detailed models of Seoul throughout its history.  It is also free and has great English explanations of almost every item., January 2020
3,5.0,Excellent!,"Recently updated and free. 600 years of Seoul, very well divided into sections. Everything was helpfully in English with very well done brochures/guides for each section.We visited on a wet day - but spent much longer than intended. Definitely worth the visit.", September 2019
4,5.0,A truly excellent museum,"Only had an hour and a half as we had bought tickets to a film showing across the street. This is a truly excellent museum, built intelligently with fascinating exhibits.  The time spent was not nearly enough and I intend to return with more time to spend.  I very highly recommend a visit.", October 2019
5,4.0,Fabulous Place To Visit,"I love going to museums and the admission for this one is free.  They have it organized clearly and you can learn about Korean history. They also have a small cafe that sells drinks, coffee, tea and light snacks.  There is also a nice gift shop there. However, when I went to go inside, I found it was closed. The person who runs it took a VERY long lunch break. This was very irritating to me. Twice, I had to go and ask the front desk lady where the person was because I wanted to buy some gifts.  The lady was nice and called the person and five minutes later the person came and opened up the store. Except for this, my overall experience here was great.", October 2019

10,5.0,Wonderful little museum,"We stumbled across this museum and were glad we did!  It's a delightful museum that shows the pride the residents of Seoul have in their city and its history.  On one of the upper floors, there's a huge miniature layout of the city.  You can stand above it or off to the side to see how the city is laid out.  You can select neighborhoods and highlight them, but unfortunately this feature is not available in English.  I can away impressed with what the people of Seoul accomplished in rebuilding their city after the war.", April 2019

13,5.0,Free and good quality museum,Good exhibits about the history of Seoul. It is free unlike museums in Europe and they dont pressure you to make a donation. Worth a visit to understand more about Seoul. Spent about 2 hours here. Well worth the time., July 2018

15,5.0,Under the radar museum with plenty of surprises,If you have time do visit this very interesting museum that showcases the six centuries of Seoul’s storied past. From its early founding as a strategic capital for the unified Korean kingdom because of the fengshui and laid out in Confucian principles it grew to become a walled city with a central avenue of commercial sites and an expanding palace with administrative buildings. If you  are familiar with period Korean dramas you will recognise the sets and interiors. From a medieval city it had to modernise with the arrival of westerners and rapid change in the late 19th century. The Japanese colonial government further changed the urban landscape from its crowded houses to more planned streets with amenities. However the medieval soul was gradually torn away with the demolition of historical sites such as the Temple of Heaven. Note the similarities with Beijing in terms of fengshui and Imperial urban planning. The much disliked colonial townhall was also built to obstruct the Korean palace. You will start to see the birth of Korean nationalism as you wander into this exhibition area. All this was devastated during the Korean War that left Seoul pretty much with only standing stone chimneys. The rapid urbanisation during the Asian Tiger economy era resulted in a functional city with little thought around urban design and well planned spaces for an exploding population that grew to ten million eventually. You will end the visit with a birds eye model of the entire city to appreciate the geography and some of the major landmarks and notable districts in Seoul., October 2018
16,5.0,My favorite museum in Seoul,"This is a fun museum and I have been here several times. For a first-time visitor, plan on at least 2-3 hours to visit. My favorite part was recent history from the 1920's to the 1990's. There is even a model of a 1980's apartment to show you how an average family lived then. The display about life for Koreans during WWII is excellent as well and explains how hard things were during the Japanese occupation. It is one of the first places you should visit in Seoul.", August 2018
17,5.0,Great little museum,"Great place to learn about Korea over the years.  Nice historical exhibits and costumes.   It was interesting to see the 60s, 70s and 80s also represented.  Takes a couple of hours to walk around.  Definitely worth a visit.", September 2017

24,5.0,Learning a bit of history,"I'm not a city museum type of person but I do have a bit of time before heading out to the airport therefore came for a visit, the best part of it is that this museum is free admission at all times and it's just a short walk from the guanghwamun which is very convenient. It's divided in a few eras, from the Empire dynasty to the Japanese colonized period, to the most recent booming of the city, everything is detailed. Great to spend an hour or 2!", March 2018

26,5.0,"Interesting museum, recommended","Another well designed Seoul museum located in the contemporary building. Well thought-out and well put together exhibition, as in many other museums in Seoul that I visited. The main message is a story of the transformation of Seoul from a small fishermen village to the one of the major world capitals. Don't miss a hall where you walk on the elevated walkway with Seoul map on the floor underneath. You can push a button for a specific city area and this area will be illuminated on the map. It helps to understand the city layout. There is a good coffee shop on the ground floor and not bad looking museum shop. You would need around 2 hours for a visit. Recommended.", November 2017
27,5.0,Hidden jewel in Seoul,"I love this museum.  Located at the front steps of Gyeonghui Gung Palace, the Seoul Museum of History designed by Mies van der Rohe protege Joung Song Kimm is an airy and well laid out museum.  Most important of all the place is free to everyone.  Inside the museum, you can see exhibitions of the life of Seoulites dating from the 15th c. to the Korean War to the post war development era to now.  Extensive and beautiful models of the city in different sizes abound the museum.  An intricate wooden model of Gwanhwamun Square leading up to Gyeongbok Gung Palace with the full royal entourage is massive and immensely detailed.  A full complement of period paintings depicting the urbanscape surrounds the room which is about a ballroom in scale.  An even more impressive model of the city depicts modern Seoul that you walk around and on via a glass floor.  The model is massive.  From Gimpo Airport to the 100 story Lotte Hotel in Jamsil, you can see the entire city in front of you as if n an airplane. I would guess the model is about a third the size of a football field.  Impressive.Further exhibitions show the fast development of Seoulite's life from the war to the present.  It is all fascinating stuff.The museum is sized just right so you don't feel overwhelmed.  Kids and adults love all the models of the city displayed throughout the museum.  All in all, the museum is a very engaging place full of interactive diplays and fully interesting exhibitions for the whole family.", December 2017

The museum is a great place to find out interesting details about Seoul’s history and is definitely worth visiting.", September 2017
31,3.0,"Interesting, but not high on the priority list...",Seoul Museum of History is worth a short visit particularly on a rainy afternoon. The two particularly worthwhile viewing are the old photos of Seoul and the large room with the Seoul map illuminating specific areas like temples etc. The rest was a little under-stimulating., October 2016
32,4.0,Have a look inside,"It has few exhibitions, even modern, you should see it when you have time, admission is free, in my opinion 1h is enough.", June 2017

34,5.0,"Love, Love, Love it.","We spent a really long time here. The exhibits were great it was a wonderful way to learn about the history of Seoul and Korea. Most of the labels are in English, Korean, Japanese and I think Mandarin. The pictures of Seoul past and present are really wonderful, same goes for the exhibit on all the different streets. The whole museum is excellent and very well done.  We also purchased a great Korean cookbook from their shop. I highly reccommend this museum.", September 2016
35,5.0,Great museum to learn about the city's history,We visited with a friend on a Sunday morning. The entrance is free. It's a great way to discover Seoul over the centuries and get a grasps of the hardship the people have suffered ., June 2017

38,3.0,Extremely Informative but the Facility itself is Outdated,"Full marks for information provided.  The museum is great for visitors who know nothing about the city to visitors who are interested in in-depth information from different eras. Wish more funding is provided to upgrade the building itself, hence the Average Rating.  Highly recommended to those who wish to learn about Seoul's history prior to their tour of the city.", February 2017
39,5.0,Hints on this place,"1) Admission is free!2) Usually it's closed on Mondays3) Children are welcome! Koreans love children, so don't be afraid if your kid is loud ) Also there's a well ecuiped lactation room and very nice children room4) Start on the 3 floor. Main exposition is there. It takes 1-1.5 hours5) Before visiting the museum figure out where you are living. It's lot of fun to find your building in great city maket on the 3 floor6) Prepare your traveller journals and don't forget to print memorial stamps!7) Small cafe, library, shop, clean WC, elevators", March 2017
40,5.0,Helps make sense of the city,"A free entry, low key museum that tells you a lot about the city. Pretty much empty when we were there. Has a wonderful scale model of the modern city ... with an armoured glass cover so that you can walk over it. Fun!", February 2017

42,4.0,So much information!,"Really nice place, admission is free, audio guide is free (you gotta bring an id for it), even water is free. It has 4 permanent exhibitions in which you get to see the evolution of corea, so if you like to read about history this is just the right place for you, I don't specially liked the audio guide since most of the times just adviced me to read the information on the walls -.-! Anyways the city model of Seoul at the end is just amazing!", January 2017
43,3.0,Interesting place to visit,"One of the interesting exhibitions is to view Seoul city model from the transparent glass walkway. There is an animated introduction on Seoul's history too which is also fun to watch. Artifacts from Unhyeon Palace are being shown here as well. This is not a big museum but still an amazing place to visit. Moreover, it offers free entry to all visitors.", December 2016
44,3.0,Confusing but full of good info on Seoul,I found this museum to be very confusing physically. It is a big place but difficult to figure out which way to go and how the rooms connected chronologically. Also it was overrun with students the day I visited which made it super crowded.  However it is free--and the various exhibits are very informative on the history of Korea and Seoul. Everything is in English also!!  The highlight is the huge model of the City of Seoul--that is a must see.  Gives you a great idea of how big Seoul is and how it is laid out.  Before I visited here I would recommend the Palace Museum at Gyeonbokgung Palace and the Cheonggyecheon Museum. They were both better arranged and had just as much information.   But if time permits--this is worthwhile., December 2016
45,4.0,Worth Going,"First of all, this museum has FREE ENTRY.  So even if you don't like it, all it cost you was your time.This museum is easy to navigate and has a good flow.  There are arrows to make sure you are going in chronological order.  Lots of artifacts too.  Most have an English title, but not necessarily English description.  IF YOU GO:  Bring your passport!  You can get an audio guide for free.  They are available in English, Chinese and Japanese.", November 2016
46,5.0,The most Interesting Museum,I really enjoyed this museum. A gentleman volunteer was my guide and I was able to learn a lot.  I highly recommend! There is a small scale map of Seoul that was so impressive. I really loved it here, November 2016

48,5.0,Very Informative!,"I was happily surprised by the National Museum. Although the majority of plaques and monitors didn't offer English - there is a ton to look at and large scale miniatures to gaze over. My favourite section had to be the gigantic miniature of Seoul. You can stand up on platforms and have lights point to different areas using a computer. From there, the computer accesses (what seems to be) Google Street View and you can walk through the area.", October 2016
49,4.0,"Not as grand as the Korean National History Museum, but still very interesting.","In addition to a very interesting collection of artifacts, ancient and modern, regarding the city of Seoul, the grounds are also make for a pleasant stroll when the weather is good.", October 2016

52,4.0,Kills an hour or so,"Stopped here to get out of the heat in August, It is like a fast tracked version of the history of seoul, starts in the dynasty days through to the modern era. Worth a visit and it's free. One thing here I liked was the scaled model of seoul, if you want to get your bearings on where everything is in the city and have a map on you, you can stand over the top of a model about the size of 3/4 of a tennis court and work out where everything is. Gives you a quick guide to seoul's history.", August 2016
53,5.0,One of the best free attractions in Seoul,"When the museum first opened, a good dozen years ago, I was so disappointed.  It was pretty much a students’ hands-on environment.  Finally, after hearing so many positives about the museum under new a curator, my wife and I visited the place once more.  While I had high expectations, the experience for both of us was much better than hoped.  The exhibits were extremely well designed and labeled in both Korean and English.  There was amble and appropriate use of multimedia.  Even the special, temporary exhibit was lavishly done in its presentation.All of this was but one more example that Korean public museums have come a long way during the past decade.  I dare say that many are now world class, and this museum is no exception.  There is a gift shop, a coffee shop, a restaurant, and even a playroom for bored young children.  Even old Korea or Seoul hands walk away learning a good deal.  My Korean wife and I agreed that the next time we have friends visiting from out of town or country, we will recommend them to visit this museum - and most likely we will try to accompany them as we look forward to return visits.", August 2016
54,5.0,Very informative about Seoul!,There is a permanent exhibit about Seoul here. There are lots to learn about and lots of fun things to do so you can bring children here. Its free for everyone to get in. Kyunghee palace is right beside the museum., August 2016

56,5.0,A Story of Adaptation,"I chose to review this museum because of the emphasis placed on details and the creative methods used to evoke sensations that make you feel like you are travelling in time. The museum covers Korean history from the middle of the 19th century until the end of the 20th century. There are five exhibits that progressively take you from one era to the next, and over the course of two weeks and four visits, I carefully went through every exhibit and read every placard. The story conveyed is one of adaptation. It isn't the typical representation of national greatness that history museums tend to portray. In fact, it is quite honest, and almost unbiased. The Koreans have had to adapt to great powers and influences that have imposed their imperial policies and culture on them. The exhibits shows how they adapted to European colonial and missionary pressure, Japanese imperialism and WWII, communism and America's proxy war with Russia and China, and the modernization accelerated by globalization. This is one of the most detailed and honest museums I have experienced. It is more than just a casual walk through. I brought with me a good understanding of how Koreans might identify themselves, where they find pride and where they find humility. I highly recommend this museum.", June 2016
57,5.0,Nice muse,"This is the first stop the Seoul guide took us.  First room we stepped on was a model map of Seoul under the glass that we walked on.  It was cool!  Dark with lights like night view.  We learned a lot from him and this place.  The Museum presents the story of Seoul from the prehistoric era to modern time. The main exhibit halls are on the 3rd floor which is divided into 4 sections; Seoul, the Capital of Joseon, People's Life in Seoul, Culture of Seoul, and Development of the Seoul City.  It also has a nice garden.", June 2016
58,5.0,Great Museum & Gardens,The highlight was the model of Seoul under glass/perspex that you could walk over - wonderful idea.  History and development of Seoul most interesting., June 2016
59,5.0,Outstanding Museum!,This is one of my favorite museums in Seoul and somewhere I always take visitors. They change the front exhibits regularly so it's interesting even for a frequent flyer like myself.The main reason to go is for the massive detailed recreation of Seoul. It's large and have most of the buildings in the city - I can find both where I work and my apartment building on there after some looking. It lights up to show different areas and is a great way to orient yourself to the city., September 2015
60,4.0,The Seoul Museum of History,"This very informative museum covers primarily the history and culture of South Korea's capital city Seoul. It covers the entire period, from pre-historic times to the present,  with particular emphasis on the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910). Most of the artifacts on display have been very generously  donated by the people of Seoul themselves.Among the items on display are porcelainware, traditional costumes and head-gear, paintings and portraits, calligraphy, historical photographs, examples of Western influences, like a tophat and its case, items of household goods like electrical appliances, and the like.Outdoor displays include a part of the Gwanghwamun Gate, an early-vintage tramcar that had actually operated on the streets of Seoul, and various stone carvings. Exhibits of life during the Joseon period, the Golden Age of Korea, are much emphasised. The museum is located on the grounds of the Gyeonghuigung Palace. Apart from its permanent exhibits, it also has temporary events in a special exhibition hall,  adjacent to the permanent one.There is also an additional hall featuring mainly the donated exhibits.There is a separate Education Room for children, an auditorium for cultural performances, like classical dances and music, as well as the Pansori - Korean vocal music sung solo, and with narrative themes.The Museum Shop has wide-ranging memorablia of Seoul, alongside a cafe and a very useful, information centre.A must-visit museum for a better understanding of Korean culture and way of life.Hormuz Mama", October 2015
61,4.0,A fascinating place,This is a beautiful building and the history of Seoul is well displayed.  Clearly they have little love of the Japanese who treated the country cruelly in times past.  There is a spectacular relief map of Seoul that is about the size of a tennis court and one can stand on glass flooring and select items on interest and the spotlight focusses on the model of that item.  Wonderfully done, June 2016
62,5.0,Great place to visit for Japanese WWII time period and Korean War,I was specifically interested in learning more about life for Koreans during the Japanese colonization and the Korean war to present. Their are multiple floors which separate ancient Korean history all the way to modern Korea today. I only went from 1940 - present and it was well done. There are areas where I think English translation was missing and would have been helpfull although most areas do include English. The audio tour is unnecessary. Best of all the museum is FREE. Great experience and I highly recommend., June 2016
63,5.0,A lot to See,Very clean and well maintained museum.  A lot of great displays and artifacts.  A quite enjoyable experience to learn more about Seoul and it is free., May 2016
64,4.0,"Well-done, interesting","I visited this museum over two separate days--it was larger than I expected and I ran out of time. Expect to spend several hours here. The bathrooms are clean, and there is a cafe and souvenir shop on the first floor. The permanent exhibit covers all of Seoul's history. The lighting was a little too dark but the displays were well done.There were also special exhibits, also free, one showcasing a photographer's work (Françoise Huguier), and another talking about art in the lives of people in Seoul in the Joseon dynasty. I also loved the exhibit showing historical photos from Seoul, many in the 1950s.My favorite part was the permanent section on Korea after the Korean War. It helped me get a sense of how quickly Korea has developed. While celebrating the achievements made in such a short time, it doesn't sugar-coat the problems or errors made. I also enjoyed the large diorama of modern day Seoul, which was so accurate I could find my apartment building. I would recommend this for anyone interested in Seoul history. I think kids would enjoy this. There is a palace next door, and it is close to several other museums (the Agricultural Museum, a police museum, a rice museum, just to name a few). It isn't very far from 경복궁/Gyeongbokgung Palace.", May 2016
65,4.0,Just right,"On this trip there were a couple of friends that didn't have any interest in museums and so I didn't go to big one - National Museum of Korea. Therefore this was sufficient enough to get a nice insight in the culture and history, yet not too long winded for those of less interest. There are 2 floors with main area on  level 2 and I took around 2 hours to see everything. Have to be a bit careful when searching google map for this place, for some reason on google map the search results showed that this is in Seoul Station, but actually this is between Gwanghwamun and Seodaemun station (which is a few stations away and on another line) must have 2 similar museums.", March 2016
66,4.0,A brief but interesting history of Seoul,"This was a nice way to spend a cool Sunday afternoon.  This museum presents a geographical history of the city of Seoul since the start of the Joseon Dynasty.  The permanent exhibit includes artifacts, maps, and dioramas of the development of the city.  It gives a good frame of reference to the city.  The final room is a current diorama of the city.  Admission is currently free and there is a nice museum store.  Be prepared for lots of school kids and families but in general they are well behaved.  They are learning about their city.  The museum is close to Gwanghwamun and the number 5 subway line.", March 2016
67,3.0,Somewhat dark and noisy inside,"I enjoyed the speical exhibition in Feb, 2016.  It was about the royal court.  The screens were fantastic and the effects were good.  However, it was somewhat dark in the main building itself, the entral hall was empty, and the souverior shop was closed for lunch, I suppose, and I felt it uninviting. The level of noise from young students was somewhat annoying.  It is unfortunate as it accupies such a great centre location of Seoul with a great history and activities. I felt that it was a waste of valuable resources.", February 2016
68,3.0,Just ok ,"It's close to Gwanghamun and free to enter.  They right now have a lego, danish exhibition and that's cool. A good place that you if interested should check out but it's not a must", February 2016
69,5.0,Worth the visit,"This modern museum offered a deep insight into the history of Korea. From the imperial days, Japanese colonisation, the Korean War, and to the now modern day Korea. Not knowing much of Korea, this museum was a great eye opener into it the sad, yet rich and celebratory history Korea has. This museum also offers free water and wifi to visitors.", February 2016

71,4.0,Filled with students but they’re working in their books so it’s ok,"I was first worried about the amount of children because as you first walk in the main entrance, there’s a Lego workshop and exhibition filled with students making projects.  Then in the Hans Christian Anderson section there were kids running around bumping into me but they were small children let loose by their parents. . There were many more children but they were well behaved by their teachers and many were sitting down writing down notes in groups. The museum won’t take you long to observe and if you are quick can be finished in about 30 minutes. If you read each exhibit especially the exhibit of the Korean cultural periods, it will take you about 2 hours. I especially liked the huge city landscape under the glass floor. There is a relatively inexpensive snack area and the restrooms have bidets (Japanese style restrooms, wow) The price of admission is free so if you’re near the downtown area, I’d advise you to come down and check this place out.", February 2016
72,3.0,Good to spend a few hours at this museum and the admission is for free,"When I was there, there was a Lego cross over Anderson exhibition at the Seoul Museum of History.  It also holds exhibits about Seoul history and daily lives of locals.", January 2016
73,4.0,Knowledge Gaining Place,"We learn about the history of Korea here. Saw a lot of school students during our visit. Very suitable for children who wants to know more about Korea History,", March 2015
74,4.0,"A short visit, but probably the best museum to comprehend the history of Korea","There are an awful lot of good historical museums in Korea, but each seems to be focused on one aspect and doesn’t give the full picture of the country. The National Museum of Korea is centered on ancient history which might not resonate to foreign visitors. The War Memorial of Korea is a superb museum as well, but it distorts the fact that since the Unified Shilla dynasty (which started around 650), Korea has actually been a fairly peaceful country. The National Museum of Korean Contemporary History pretty much only deals with the 20th century, and can be – if ever so slightly – overly nationalistic. The National Folk Museum of Korea is more of a collection of artifacts from the old days rather than a true testament to Korean history. The Seoul Museum of History, on the other hand, despite being small (it doesn’t take more than 2 hours to visit), does a great job at showing the history of Korea since the 14th century, through the eyes of the city’s evolution. It perfectly depicts the evolution of Seoul and Korea has well, without glossing over the harder times of the city’s history. The museum also has an interactive model of the city that is something like 15*20 meters and allows you to see individual buildings, while highlighting specific areas thanks to a nice user-interface. This place alone makes the museum worth the trip, and is very kids-friendly. The only drawbacks about this museum is that it doesn’t have the scale of some of the city’s larger museums, and the building itself is not the most aesthetically pleasing, especially considering that the museum only opened in 2002.", January 2016
75,5.0,deap,the history of SK is so strange and full of holes. I see that the system has the most effect on society, April 2015
76,4.0,It's free,"It's right next to the train station (when you exit and before you reach the palace's gates) but it usually gets overlooked. There's not a lot of things inside but good for a 25 mins walk. Plus, they had stamps that you can stamp on paper for free as souvenir.", November 2015
77,5.0,Great to go later in the day,Museum open till 8. We arrived about 6 and had the place almost to ourselves. Free entry but would have been happy to pay. Quality exhibits. Took out odder who had a good time. Plenty to keep him interested too., December 2015
78,4.0,A Lovely Primer to Seoul,"While the museum is relatively small, there are a lot of interesting artifacts, dioramas, and good signage (in English, too) that show how Seoul evolved from a kingdom to a pop cultural and technological juggernaut (mostly in the past two decades). There's a free, fun photo booth that puts you in historic settings, as well as proximity to one of the city's lesser known and ornate, but hugely interesting palaces nearby. It's a good first stop as well as a fun place to take the kids or take shelter from rain or snow...and you can't beat the admission price!", November 2015
79,3.0,nice,"nice to take picture and learn seoul history, cold whether, peaceful and  a giant interactive city model is one of many highlights. Definitely worth stopping by for an hour or two.", November 2015
80,4.0,Must Visit,"Admission for free. A place where you must visit to know more about Seoul. Take Metro line no.5 and use the exit 5 at Gwanghwamun station, then walk around 300m. Great description for the history of the formation of Seoul city.", November 2015
81,4.0,good place to visit first if you're in Seoul for a few weeks or more,"The historical exhibits are moving, clearly showing what the residents of Seoul have been through in the past hundred years.  Subjugation, war, deprivation -- they've been through it all and evolved this beautiful, vibrant city.  The historical exhibits here give you a feel for what life was like here over that time.But the highlight is the huge model of the city.  You can walk over it, shine spotlights on different parts of it, project close-up views on a big screen -- and get a really good idea of what is where in Seoul!  Great for helping you plan what else you want to see and where to go to see it.", July 2015
82,4.0,"Not much history, but great information",I guess the national museum called dibs on all the interesting artefacts. There is not much history in this history museum but the displays are well worth a visit. Seoul and South Korea have both undergone dramatic changes in the past century and this museum is terrific for an introduction in to the recent history of Korea. A giant interactive city model is one of many highlights. Definitely worth stopping by for an hour or two., January 2015
83,5.0,"Must see, without doubt","Breathtaking huge interactive model of the city; amazing collection of artifacts and photos, well displayed and explained in English; and most striking exhibit of the evolution of the 20th-century megalopolis that leaves no doubt whatsoever about how and why Koreans love the Japanese so much!", August 2015
84,4.0,a good history lession for those who are interested.,"The museum is free but it contains a lot of galleries.  It has an replica of a typical run-down restaurant and a model of present-day Seoul.  It had extensive showcase of Seoul's history including a replica of a typical apartment home, complete with furnishing.  It's a great way to spend a couple hours.  We went in September and it was rather hot in the building.", September 2015
85,2.0,More of interpretive centre,"Not really a museum, more of an interpretive centre on the history of Seoul. There are few artefacts, but rather displays. Seems to be used as daycare centre for kids. Ok for a short visit or if you have kids. Nice cafeteria.", September 2015
86,5.0,interesting.,"the nearest hotel door man recommeded the place and that was very interesting!nice place to travel for 2,3hour.", August 2015
87,5.0,Wonderful nightview model of Seoul,"This is one of the less-visited large museums in the city.  The highlight for me is the wonderful, huge, topographical nightview model of Seoul that has glass-bottom footbridges over it.  While you walk across, the city lights come on in the areas you pass over.  There's also a museum employee on hand to help you identify different areas of the city.  Really impressive.", June 2015
88,5.0,Really interesting museum telling the story of Seoul,"If you want to learn the history of Seoul (not the entire country) come to this museum. Staff are very friendly. Permanent exhibits are in both Korean and English, while special exhibits are generally only in Korean. We especially liked the ""Tardy Student"" tram/streetcar outside, the Seoul 1988 Olympics, the apartment/traditional city living, and the large scale model of the city (who knew it was SO huge). There's also a lovely cafe for a bite to eat or a coffee.We tried to send photos from the free photo booths but they never arrived in our email boxes. So, if you use them (and they are quite fun) be sure to take a picture with your camera or phone.", July 2015
89,5.0,Puts history in perspective,The Seoul Museum of History is a wonderful museum which puts all of the history you learn about at other places in Seoul into perspective. The section about life in Seoul under the Joseon dynasty features impressive models and information about how the government worked and where certain social groups and business and leisure activities happened. The sections about life under Japanese occupation and the development of the city since the end of the Korean War were very interesting and show just how remarkable a place this city is. The best part of the museum is saved for last - a massive scale model of Seoul!, July 2015
90,5.0,I wanted to see everything.,"I found this museum far more interesting than the National Museum. There is a large collection of artefacts here spreading over hundreds of years. The lady in the streetcar out the front was really friendly, chatting to me in English and Korean. The temporary exhibit was really interesting, and displayed in a very artistic way. I particularly enjoyed watching the development of the city over the last 200 years. They had a really nice courtyard, which on a sunny day would have been beautiful to enjoy while eating something from the cafe. Oh yeah, and it was free!", July 2015
91,4.0,Much cooler than expected,"This museum wasn't on my list of attractions that I wanted to visit, but when it started raining during our tour our private guide suggested we stop by this museum and I'm very glad we did.  We all enjoyed seeing the large model of historic Seoul and the really huge model of modern Seoul (it fills up an entire large room) is really fun and helps give you a better feeling for the layout of this large city that is surrounded my mountains.", June 2015
92,4.0,Seoul Museum of History,"This is a very nice museum for the culture and history of the city of Seoul, not of Korea as a country. For that you have to go to the National Museum by Ichon Station. This museum is next to gyeonghuigung palace and a short walk to the gwanghwamun area. The artifact inside the museum are interesting (especially if you haven't been to the national museum). There also many interesting statues in the surrounding gardens in the back of the museum.", August 2014
93,4.0,Small Seoul in the past,Enjoyed the way the culture and history was captured specifically for Seoul from the onset. The address posted is to Seoul Station which is south of the Museum., July 2014
94,4.0,Great historical background for understanding your visit to Seoul,"While the ancient history exhibits on the first floor are pleasantly interesting, the Seoul Museum of History has a terrific section upstairs on recent history that puts the development of the modern city into clear context.  Like most Americans, I learned very little about Korea in school and knew very little about the city when I arrived for a two week stay.  The exhibit powerfully illustrates the vast poverty and hardship of post-Korean War and then the decades of redevelopment of the city, the economy, and society.  Modern Seoul is such as cosmopolitan and handsome city so it was shocking to see the pictures of shacks and peasants along the Han River.  Allow sufficient time to wander through the exhibits and read all the captions.  There is also a huge-scale model of the modern city covered in glass that you can walk on and explore the city from an interesting view.  The ground floor café and the gift shop are very nice.   The museum is worth a short stroll off the main street.", April 2015
95,3.0,Nice building,"The museum is interesting though probably not for everyone. The grounds around it are marvellous and people use it to get out of their units , for walks and exercise so its very nice and useful and a pleasant outing. but...... a bit bland", May 2015
96,5.0,Well presented story of Seoul and Korea,"On the ground floor is a beautifully laid out display of 50 top artefacts which tell the story of the city from early times up until yesterday.  The layout of the other floors is a bit confusing, but worth wandering around as you can really get a feel for the growth of this amazing city, told through photos, videos, models and artefacts.", June 2015
97,4.0,Very fulfilling,This museum will take at least 4 hours of your time. They have so many wonderful exhibits that are so well displayed. After  you visit this museum you will have a very clear understanding of Korean history.  This is a must visit to anyone visiting this beautiful city., September 2014
98,4.0,Heavy on the two Japanese occupations of Korea,"Having a guide really enhanced the visit; otherwise, I would have missed a lot.  Particularly note the traditionally painted and restored and remains of one of the former palaces outside the entrance.", June 2015
99,5.0,Fascinating ,A well thought out museum and I learnt a lot from it. I think it is a good place to get a background of South Korea and I would recommend a visit., November 2014
100,5.0,Impressive,"The whole place is huge, you can easily spend half a day going through. We only stayed 2 hours as we were hungry, but everything we saw was pretty amazing. Our faves were the Neolithic era relics, including the pretty well-preserved skeleton from that age.", April 2015
101,4.0,A good museum,"Korea has a great wealth of history.  This is a great way to learn more about  Korea!!  It is a good museum with lots of different exhibits!!  However, it is a history museum...so if that isn't your thing...skip it!", July 2014
102,5.0,"Must see, many very nice stuff","I loved this place, together with everything else, it has a couple of very nice things, one of them was you could have you picture taken in different Korean outfits, this was a digital gadget that was really funny and then there was the model that shows all of Seoul build inside the museum, also window glas in different colors. Try to see this place.", March 2015
103,5.0,Excellent Addition,"Seoul needed a Korean history museum, and this is an excellent addition to an excellent selection of museums.  Good location too, and not too big.  Definitely worth a visit when you are visiting Kyongbok Palace.", March 2015
104,4.0,Not a bad museum,"Its a pretty unique museum, has the entire model buildings of the city of Seoul, the world's second largest metropolitan city in the world! So it was pretty cool. It had a lot of hands on stuff for the kids upstairs, and a nice outdoor park too. But the real beauty of this place is the fact that it is FREEE!!!! Free admission. Only the restaurant there kinda stinks, but its best to go for the museum experience, and witness what this city has been through in history.", April 2014
105,4.0,A must,A fabulous museum. Great collections. Everything is translated in english so you get to understand the facts., October 2014
106,4.0,Good Seoul Museum,"This is a nice museum that provides good history of Korea with emphasis on Seoul. It has a very large model of modern Seoul that was neat.  We spent some time just looking at this model.  We had our four. Holden which is a challenge at times in a museum.  This is a good museum and shows the history of Seoul and the ""Miracle on the Han"".  Behind the museum is a nice smaller palace that you can see as well.  It was free except for the parking fee, which we had as we drove.", December 2014
107,4.0,Good intro to Korean history,We enjoyed our two hours in this museum. There are interactive stations for the children to try out. The 3D map of Seoul on the 3rd floor is amazing. I just wish there was more information in English and not just Korean. WOuld recommend this on a rainy day and with children., November 2014
108,5.0,A nice museum if you like History,"I was actually looking for the free taekwando demonstration (supposelly in Gyeonghuigung according to my guide book) but it has been moved to Namsangol since last year. This museum was just next to the palace and I entered just to have a look. It was a really nice surprise!Close to Gyeongbokgung and Gwanghwamun, this museum is a nice introduction to Seoul history. Free entrance and a lot of maps which explain the evolution of Korea. You can also see a lot of old pictures (beginning of the XX century) and an impressive model of Seoul (size 1/500). If you have time after visiting of Gyeongbokgung, I'd definitelly recommend to go untill there. They also have a nice garden where you can enjoy a coffee or a cup of tea.To go there, go at the end of Gwanghamun square (where the statue of the Korean warrior is) and walk to your right for around 500m.", October 2014
109,5.0,Museum that will allow you to understand Seoul history,"This museum which is free allows give you a glance of why Seoul was founded there and the struggle that it has suffer over the years by the invasion of Chinese and Japanese to the city. Also the museography is really nice as it reproduce in a model the life one of the most important street of the city where all merchants were located and finally they tell you that you walk until now a days in that street which is jongno.Another interesting part is the model of Seoul now a days in a scale 1:50000, in here you can appreciate the size of the city and the density of the city.I think that a visit on the first they of your stay in Seoul would allow you to understand better the city and its different areas.", September 2014
110,5.0,Easy Intro about Seoul,"Out to give you a short , concise information about the colorful history of Seoul, Throw in a visit to Gyeonghiguing Palace, at the back,  and your day will be complete.", September 2014
111,4.0,A Quick Visit of the History of Seoul.,"This free museum highlights Seoul and its evolution over the years.  As you walk through it is interesting to see how much the city has changed and grown in about 100 years. Even the photos from the past couple of decades are interesting.  I'd say about 95% of the exhibits have English but there are some that only have Korean which makes me wonder if it is kind of masking things that they might not want known to many others countries' visitors, for example, the ""food shortage"" section was only in Korean but almost everything else had English translations.  There's one room where you see an aerial view of present day Seoul and can even try to find where you're staying.  About an hour is good enough time to spend at this museum.", September 2014
112,4.0,A Nice Introduction to Korean History,A good way to spend 1-2 hours getting some background on Korean History with an emphasis on Seoul. Lots of hands-on experiences for kids. Easy to find. Free admission. A Nice gift shop., July 2014
113,5.0,Another excellent museum,"This museum is a 10 minute walk from the Museum of Contemporary History, located in a lovely parkland in the midst of busy Seoul.  Take a walk around the building and enjoy the neighboring palace, too!  The permanent and temporary exhibits share the history and development of this very modern city.  I always find it inconceivable when I see the pre-War photos and see what is in Seoul now.  The coffee shop is a nice retreat.", June 2014
114,5.0,More than meets the eye,"Admission is free and I must say these free entrance is a real good deal! Not a really big museum but you really need a few hours to explore all the areas. There's just too much to learn over there. From the knowledge of the development of the country, to Joseon dynasty history to the miniature city landscape of korea, it's just soo educative and interesting to explore.Unlike museum in Singapore, seoul museum has a very interesting & creative ways to portray their display. That alone is enough to wow you for 1/2 an hour. You can take picture with their system and best part, they will email the photos to you so you'll get to keep a memory of your trip there!", May 2014
115,4.0,Interesting model of the city in this city museum,"This museum is in the heart of Seoul access by the Gwanghwamun subway station and directly opposite a huge 10 storey statue of a hammering man.  The museum is not large.  The miniature scale model of the entire city on the 2nd floor is a very interesting visit.  The guide there was very helpful and highlighted areas of the city and gave an overview of the span of this sprawling city.  Other than this display, the rest is a rather standard display of the history of the development and growth of the city.  The old photographs traced the interesting entry of foreign influence into Seoul. Good restful stop in the city.", February 2014
116,4.0,"Quick, easy & informative + child friendly","Small museum that describes the history and urbanization of the city of Seoul. The astounding pace at which this city has grown and modernized really sinks in here. Some (limited) fragments of Korea's broader history, especially last 150 years also on display. Many pictures, displays, a 1000 sqft model of city will keep children interested too. Interesting, free, quick to visit, very central, air conditioned/heated. Can't really ask for more.", July 2013
117,3.0,History of Seoul,"I thought this would be more about the history of Korea but the history of Seoul is interesting as it has been a main city for a long time. The museum starts in the 1200s and goes up to 2002 when Korea hosted the Olympics, so it does cover a lot of time. There is also a mini city inside which is quite impressive, but not as impressive as others that I've seen (i.e. Shanghai)", December 2012
118,4.0,Seoul history museum,"close to Gwanghwamum square and Gyeonbok Palace. walk distance from these 2 popular palces. free admission, you can compare the city of Seoul, old and new(now)..old means 1890s.. new means now.Pls have a look if you are in Gyeongbok Gung or Gwanghwamun. it is less than 20 min walk, away.", November 2012
119,3.0,Not Bad,"This museum is not too bad.  If your are on a short stay this is not a must see, but if you are here for a longer stay or even living here you may find some of the exhibits quite interesting.", June 2012
120,5.0,The Seoulo Museum of History.,"One of the South Korean capital's latest museums, the Seoul Museum of History first opened its gates onloy in mis 2002.  It covers the history, culture and way of life of the people of that great city from the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) to the present, and even offers a taltalising peek into the future.  Most of the artifacts on display had been donated by the proud residents of Seoul.These range from the ceremonial robes of one of the kings, classical paintings, portraits of notable citizens of the city, quality wooden antique furniture arranged as in a typical household, porcelainware, astronomical charts, and a great deal more. There is a lovely diorama recreating the market-place along the Han River.For me, the most fascinating part of the museum was the part covering the early Joseon eraAs we move closer to the 20th century, the artifacts change to items like a phonograph with an enormous horn to focus the sound, and a period telephone.Another exhibit that should not be missed is a 1:1,500 scale model of Seoul based on high-quality aerial photographs. It  covers not only the Seoul of today, but also shows plans for its future development.The museum is based in a modern-architecture building.  Its plaza has several open-air exhibits like a 1930s streetcar and stone artifacts, including the tombstone of Prince Eunsin.There is a well-stocked museum shop for souvenir hunters, and a well-maintained cafe.  Admission to the permanent exhibits is free.  The museum is a labour of love, and should not be missed.", June 2011
121,4.0,pretty good to now Seoul history,"in order to fee the recent Seoul, such as 1970's Myeongdong, late authors anogny, it was quite OK. Museum itself, is small place but behind the museum, there is a palace whic were simbolic of Korean history. it is under the renovation but still you can look around partially. that combination is good to go.", March 2012
122,4.0,Awesome 3D city model!,"This museum with a free entrance is definitely worth a visit if only for the 3D model of Seoul - located on the 2nd floor, it's an amazing work of art, showing you literally every building of the city. This huge model, partly under a glass floor visitors walk on, can also show you some specific areas of the city, using different colours of lighting. The language of the interactive part is Korean only though. The other exhibitions of the museum are also interesting, especially one about the urban development of Seoul. Most of the descriptions are both in Korean and English.", December 2011
