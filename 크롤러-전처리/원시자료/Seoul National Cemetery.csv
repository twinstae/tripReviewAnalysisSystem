0,5.0,What a beautiful place,It is a cemetery indeed but it is so well done that it shows a tremendous amount of respect to the diseased. Beautiful autumn trees and very calm and relaxing atmosphere. I would def recommend to visit and pay respect. , November 2019
1,5.0,What a beautiful resting place,"I visited on Saturday and was happily surprised how beautiful, serene and immaculately clean is the cemetery. The graves arranged symmetrically, are well kept. I went to see the blossoms at the cemetery as I found out it is a popular place to see the blossoms. The cemetery amidst the blooming trees looked especially beautiful. I enjoyed my leisure walk and probably will come back here in the fall.", April 2019
2,5.0,Room for Reflection,Huge cemetery and war memorial in a busy part of Seoul buffered by woodland on most sides that allow for a beautiful and sobering walk. War relics and interpretative materials are available in buildings scattered about the acreage while there are many small monuments and notable tombs/graves. I was most impressed with the staff - many sought me out to provide English materials or just tried to make the experience richer in some way - a quiet and profound experience to take in over an hour or more., March 2018
3,4.0,The national cemetery in Seoul,"National cemetery you can enjoy walking with your friends!!Its huge, taking a few hours to look around!!!Former presidents, military soldiers, police and others who devoted their lives to the country!!!", November 2017
4,4.0,"Immaculately maintained, gorgeous landscaped cemetery and park area","I recently visited the Seoul National Cemetery with friends during the peak cherry blossom bloom time in the city. We found it by searching for the best places to see cherry blossoms in Seoul and it didn't disappoint! The blooms were absolutely stunning in/around the cemetery. We enjoyed a very pleasant walk and took lots of photos of the trees and other landscaping. It is unbelievably clean and well-maintained. Parts of the part reminded us of Arlington national cemetery in the USA. There are lots of interesting sculptures, building architecture, and walking paths to enjoy. It would be a nice place to spend a few hours enjoying the fresh air with kids or adults.", April 2017
5,4.0,Very calm and impressive,A very calm and impressive area. It is a huge cemetery that spreads out basically still in the middle of Seoul. It reminds one of the sacrifices that are necessary for a nation and its people to be free. I really liked the fact that not just soldiers but also patriots as well as honorable citizens are buried here!, September 2016
6,4.0,Cemetery and Park combined,"It is the National Cemetery, a huge plot of land in the middle of the city, very well kept.  An impressive memorial to unknown & missing soldiers, along with Arlington Cemetery-like graves.  But this cemetery also includes a museum, photo exhibits, snack bar, convenience store, picnic tables, outdoor performances, so that it is a great (free) gathering place for families and couples, particularly during the current cherry blossom season!  Subway: Dongjak station exit 8;  and there is a parking lot, too.", April 2016
7,4.0,Underrated and Calming,"I have lived in Korea for 12 years (almost 11 in Seoul) but had never been here before. Koreans don't consider cemeteries as a place to sightsee and I've never suggested to my non-Korean friends to check this place out. I had some free time yesterday and wanted to go to a new place I hadn't been. I was surprised at how quiet it was. There are older people that just go there for a walk. It's laid out beautifully with grave markers everywhere to commemorate soldiers from the Korean War. I especially loved going to the top and looking below. The sight is astounding and you don't feel like you're in the middle of a large metropolitan area.There is no entrance fee. You can go to the visitor's center if you like to check out books or get pamphlets to tell you who is buried there or just go right in and stroll around by yourself.Don't forget to check out the clock on the grass which is at the entrance (at the rotary). I didn't realize it was a real clock!Finally, another reviewer said that the Seoul National Cemetery is near Exit 6. I'm not sure if the exit number changed but as of February 23, 2016 it is near EXIT 8.", February 2016
8,4.0,Hauntingly serene and beautiful,The National Cemetery has a hauntingly beautiful air to it that instantly makes you feel more humbled and calm.A great place for a stroll especially during spring and autumn when the park foliage have much more color to them., September 2015
9,4.0,"Humbling, Eery, Beautiful","Seoul National Cemetery is one of the biggest cemeteries I've had the opportunity to visit, and despite having been built a long time ago, it feels brand new, with great cleaning/gardening work done year round. The amount of tombs and graveyard is absolutely insane, and is a testimony of Korea's complicated and often tragic history. There are also dedicated tombs for Generals as well as three former présidents (Lee Syngman, Park Chung-Hee, Kim Jae-Dong), and a few memorial-like buildings or structures along the way. It's interesting to notice some soldiers in uniform guarding some buildings. The cemetery sits nicely in a amphiteater-like mountain, with trees and mountains on one side, and a beautiful open view on the Han River and the Riverside on the other. Finally, the atmosphere is also a reason to go there. The overall cemetery is very silent, and you will see some people mourning their loved ones, but you will also encounter people picnicing in the nearby forest, or kids playing soccer or flying kites in some other areas. The mix of people of different age, of innocence and sorrow, is strangely beautiful.", September 2015
10,4.0,A must-visit in Seoul,"We visited here totally on a whim en route to Bongeunsa, and it was an unexpectedly fascinating and sobering experience. The divisive effects of the Korean War can be felt everywhere in Seoul, and nowhere more keenly than here. The graves stretch forever up onto the hillside. Not a full day out, but undoubtedly worth your time.", July 2015
11,4.0,Eerily quiet but strangely beautiful.,"I was here all alone, and the place is eerily quiet but at the same time eerily beautiful.Tens of thousands of graves line orderly next to each other as far as your eye can see. Really makes you stand there reflecting and thinking about the sacrifices some of the people who are buried here have gone through to make Korea what it is today.There were a couple of museums but it was closed when i was there (after 5pm)Also saw a number of locals jogging on the inside perimeter of the cemetery. Would probably make a good running location if you're staying nearby during your trip.", September 2014
12,4.0,Salute Korea's Patriots and Soldiers,"A perfect memorial park with thousands of graves very well preserved since long years-for soldiers, patriots, great politicians, Presidents and their Wives- perfect floral tributes in well shrined buildings as well as open-Great Statues at Entrance to grounds and main building- trees of many varieties- flowers colorful and all including Cherry Blossoms-Line 4,Dongjak station - exit 8- gallery from station itself has good well lit photos.My Salutes to all.....", April 2015
13,5.0,Another must visit in Seoul,"if you are interested in Korean history this is a worthwhile place to visit. There are English pamphlets in the ""letter boxes"" that you can take which outlines the history of the cemetery and people buried there.Easy to get to as it right by the subway exit 6 on the number 9 line.", December 2014
14,5.0,beautiful,Seouls national cemetery is very highly respected place with lots of proud locals and families who help clean the gravestones. The place is lovely to go and visit especially if you have a historical connection, July 2014
15,3.0,Not much to see.,There isn't very much to see there but the travel of the country is quite easy to be In different regions., August 2013
16,4.0,Feel the spirit of the Korean Nation,"According to the Asian culture, the choice of the location of the final resting place for the deceased is of great importance to ensure prosperity, happiness and success for later generations.  If you wish to have a hands-on feeling of the national spirit of South Korea, to know more about its past and present, and to understand first-hand “Fengshui”  theories, the Seoul National Cemetery is worth a visit.  	It is located south of the Hangang River and surrounded by hills and slopes of Mt Gwanaksan.  According to “Fengshui,” the flow of water symbolizes the flow of wealth while the mountains symbolize natural, spiritual and human support you can depend upon in times of need.  Three of the Korean ex-presidents are buried here, together with some 168000 patriots, who made contributions to the country throughout its history.  	Not far from the southwest gate of the cemetery lies the Memorial Hall, covering a photo exhibition house and a relics exhibition house.  Both traces the Korean history of resistance against the Japanese occupation and touches upon the 1950-53 Korean War to some extent.  For the education of the Korean youth and the general public, there is also a multi-function media building where visitors can watch videos, movies or performances.  What impresses me most, once inside the cemetery, is its massive green lawns, trees, flowers, and statues.  It is a huge park south of the Hangang River in the heart of Seoul.  The whole area appears so peaceful and quiet.  Children can be seen playing on the ground and elderly Seoulites having a restful day off.", June 2012
