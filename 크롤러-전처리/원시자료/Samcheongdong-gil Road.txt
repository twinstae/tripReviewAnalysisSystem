It is tree-lined with many shops, cafes, pop-up shops, galleries, and leads down to one of the palaces and the art museums near Gwanghamun.  I went to the Heartist Store (another review), a restaurant whose name was in Korean but I had a bibimbap with acorn jelly and berry makgulli (which I learned quickly was alcohol but did taste good!), and Ogada Tea Cafe (where I fell in love with their Hallabong-Umija Tea Fruit Blending).  I also stopped at Inhui, an organic clothing and home goods store, which is next door to the Owl Museum (that sadly was not open so only able to see all the decorations on the outside of the place).

Found it by accident.   its pretty, have lots of nice small shops to look at.  Was told that there is a street that sells lots of shoes, but we didnt have time.  Look out for the guys or gals wearing the red vest, they are the mobile tourist reps whom you can check with if you need help.

85,3.0,"Lovely for walks, but things are over-priced and expensive","Again, this is one of the areas in Seoul highly recommended by blogs/people etc. Its actually really close by Gyeongbuk Palace (just beside it) but it’s abit of a long walk from the main entrance. The streets are really pretty and we took a lot of photos there. Lots of interesting cafes but I noted a lack of restaurants/places selling “proper” full meals at affordable prices. Also, I felt that what a lot of people don’t mention is how pricey things are in this area. I ended up not doing any shopping and just browsed around. There are lots of quaint/independent shops selling hand-crafted accessories and you won’t find these stores anywhere else. Overall, a nice place for a stroll and a coffee or ice-cream but things are on the pricey end. Also, it has become a very touristy area and I have a tendency to want to stay away from areas that have too many tourists. Sad to say I was pretty disappointed and though I found the area to be really lovely, I feel that it tends to be a little over-rated by people.", April 2016
86,3.0,Worth the walk and time,The old architecture of common peoples houses are worth your time.

104,5.0,Nice place to spend a day cafe-hopping,"Samcheongdong is located on higher ground at the foothills of Seoul's Bukhansan (northern mountains). It used to be full of traditional Korean houses or hanoks but many of the owners have either sold or leased out their premises so the area has developed into a charming district of hanoks interspersed with contemporary low rise buildings with many cafés and restaurants, art galleries and private/mini museums and artisanal shops. The Korean Prime Minister's residence is located along Samcheongdong 7-gil (street). While Garosugil in Sinsadong, Gangnam is primarily a commercialized shopping street dotted with a handful of cafés, I prefer the laid back vibe of Samcheongdong with its electic mix of private hanok dwellings and small enterprise. There are more cafés than shops in Samcheongdong. One heads to Garosugil to shop but Samcheongdong is the place to go cafe-hopping. The nearest subway station is Anguk Station on the orange line.", October 2015

I recommend you to taste tteokbboki in samcheongdong named moksuidona 목쉬돈나. It is so famous and already reviewd globally by the food blogger around the world. You could find street musician along the street. Some murals 'we are young'. Florist at the intersection is my favorite, the smell and bunch of flowers just blew my mind away. Near from this area you could easily reach gyeongbokgung palace and national museum. It is a really nice time to chill after visiting that tourism places. I came around here already 10 times, and i still enjoyed every momment of it, flowing thru the narrow roads and wondering which coffee shop that offered you cozy place and make nice memories.", October 2015

115,4.0,"Trendy, Bobo, yet relaxing","Samcheongdong is an up and coming neighborhood located between Gyeongbokgung and Bukchon, and has become trendy of late. Designers, art galleries, fusion restaurants are to be found on each side of the neighborhood's main artery. It feels less commercial than Garosugil, and less over-the-top than Apgujeong, giving the place a very organic feel. It's also perfectly located, surrounded by Bukchon, Jongro, Gyeongbokgung and Bukhansan. It's way more relaxing than other trendy neighborhoods, and is a great place to chill out and shop or relax with your other half. That being said, there isn't anything specific to see per se. The neighborhood is nice to stroll around, but don't expect some must-see Landmark.", May 2015

128,5.0,Excellent walk thru old Seoul with modern features,"You can start your journey way before getting to Samcheong-dong.  This is a beautiful walk.  Start from the top of Insadong-gil.  Actually just follow the crowds.  Cross the main street Yulgok-ro and enter what looks like a private drive.  It actually is not, rather a street.  You will see many people and students walk into this street.  There is not much initially, you pass a huge school and concrete and brink walls.  Eventually you will start to see flower shops, restaurants, coffee shops, etc. keep walking and at the intersection, a library on your right, cross over and take a left at the Khiel's follow the road to the left and observe the old small korean homes some converted to galleries, bars, restaurants and coffee shops and lot of specialty shops.  Keep walking to the end. You will pass a étude cosmetic shop.  At the main street, turn right and again observe the shops, restaurants especially those built up the side of the mountain, that will be on your right hand side.  If you walk far enough and you reach the Starbucks built in a ultra modern building, you can cross the street and walk back on the opposite side of the street.  Throughout all this walk you will see interesting sights and culture and history.  Remember at the Bene coffee shop take a left to walk back up the same direction.  Down one of the side streets on your right, is a sandwich/tart/dessert shop.  It is called Retrona Pies.  It is worth a stop for a drink and delicious sandwich, not to mention the luscious the pies and cakes.  From there you can continue back until you reach Insadong again.  You may be visiting some specialty shops that hit your fancy or stop for a coffee tea or lunch.  I think you will enjoy this walk, a different break from the palaces, temples and high rise building.", June 2014
129,4.0,"Elegant mix of modern and traditional boutique shops, restaurants and galleries","Just along the Eastern side of Gyeongbokgung Palace is a relaxing, peaceful and elegant street - Samcheongdong-gil hosts boutique shops, stylish cafes and galleries. Many of the cafes are very unique - offering views of the streets outside from an elevated position - you can just sit and watch time pass by... A very classy area and recommended for the atmosphere.", April 2014
