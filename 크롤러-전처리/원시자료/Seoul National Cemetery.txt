0,5.0,What a beautiful place,It is a cemetery indeed but it is so well done that it shows a tremendous amount of respect to the diseased. Beautiful autumn trees and very calm and relaxing atmosphere. I would def recommend to visit and pay respect. , November 2019
1,5.0,What a beautiful resting place,"I visited on Saturday and was happily surprised how beautiful, serene and immaculately clean is the cemetery. The graves arranged symmetrically, are well kept. I went to see the blossoms at the cemetery as I found out it is a popular place to see the blossoms. The cemetery amidst the blooming trees looked especially beautiful. I enjoyed my leisure walk and probably will come back here in the fall.", April 2019
2,5.0,Room for Reflection,Huge cemetery and war memorial in a busy part of Seoul buffered by woodland on most sides that allow for a beautiful and sobering walk. War relics and interpretative materials are available in buildings scattered about the acreage while there are many small monuments and notable tombs/graves. I was most impressed with the staff - many sought me out to provide English materials or just tried to make the experience richer in some way - a quiet and profound experience to take in over an hour or more., March 2018

4,4.0,"Immaculately maintained, gorgeous landscaped cemetery and park area","I recently visited the Seoul National Cemetery with friends during the peak cherry blossom bloom time in the city. We found it by searching for the best places to see cherry blossoms in Seoul and it didn't disappoint! The blooms were absolutely stunning in/around the cemetery. We enjoyed a very pleasant walk and took lots of photos of the trees and other landscaping. It is unbelievably clean and well-maintained. Parts of the part reminded us of Arlington national cemetery in the USA. There are lots of interesting sculptures, building architecture, and walking paths to enjoy. It would be a nice place to spend a few hours enjoying the fresh air with kids or adults.", April 2017

9,4.0,"Humbling, Eery, Beautiful","Seoul National Cemetery is one of the biggest cemeteries I've had the opportunity to visit, and despite having been built a long time ago, it feels brand new, with great cleaning/gardening work done year round. The amount of tombs and graveyard is absolutely insane, and is a testimony of Korea's complicated and often tragic history. There are also dedicated tombs for Generals as well as three former pr√©sidents (Lee Syngman, Park Chung-Hee, Kim Jae-Dong), and a few memorial-like buildings or structures along the way. It's interesting to notice some soldiers in uniform guarding some buildings. The cemetery sits nicely in a amphiteater-like mountain, with trees and mountains on one side, and a beautiful open view on the Han River and the Riverside on the other. Finally, the atmosphere is also a reason to go there. The overall cemetery is very silent, and you will see some people mourning their loved ones, but you will also encounter people picnicing in the nearby forest, or kids playing soccer or flying kites in some other areas. The mix of people of different age, of innocence and sorrow, is strangely beautiful.", September 2015
10,4.0,A must-visit in Seoul,"We visited here totally on a whim en route to Bongeunsa, and it was an unexpectedly fascinating and sobering experience. The divisive effects of the Korean War can be felt everywhere in Seoul, and nowhere more keenly than here. The graves stretch forever up onto the hillside. Not a full day out, but undoubtedly worth your time.", July 2015
