0,5.0,No more museum excites more,Unforgettable experience! Museum located in unexpected area of Hongik Uni. Before entering u download an app in which U make photo or video. Better video because it will provide u with amazing special effects like in fantasy movies. Every corner of the museum has its own, January 2020
1,5.0,Absolutely worth a visit and so much fun!,"We had such a great time here. There is an App you download when you go in which brings the place to life. We had so much fun taking videos and pictures and there is even an opportunity to get your portrait done as an oil painting, which was a great keepsake to take home. A great tip for couples, take a tripod so you can get shots of both of you!", January 2020
2,5.0,Really cool place,This place is a lot of fun! I was traveling alone so I got a guide to accompany me so I could get some great photos. They have an app that works with some of the exhibits to get you some really cool videos and photos., September 2019

6,4.0,Generation Instagram,, January 2020
7,5.0,Trick eye Museum,Small place but worth the little money you spend. First time I have been to a place like this and my wife and I had a good time. Not to crowded and it conveniently located in the same building as the Love Museum and Ice Museum. Also has several things to do close by so makes for a great day trip., January 2020
8,4.0,Quite a tricky attraction to eye out,"Had some trouble finding this attraction  because it is located in a building without a clear and obvious sign. After figuring out which building it was then also had the difficult of finding the entrance which is at the basement of the building, which it shares with another attraction. Spent about 1.5 hrs here taking various photos. The background was intriguing and allowed one to take various interesting photos.", December 2019
9,2.0,Not great.,"The trickeye portion is ok but I expected all pictures to have AR effects, not just 4. The VR portion was very bad. The only ride that was working for 2 people was a roller coaster. There are so many boring VR rollercoasters and this is one of them. All other rides were broken including a ride with 2 chairs but they told me only one was working.", December 2019
10,2.0,Overated,, November 2019
11,4.0,Fun!,Weather wasn't the best when I arrived i Seoul so my Daughter suggested us to visit the place. We had so much fun and giggles., September 2019
12,5.0,Highlight of Seoul,This museum was one of my most memorable place in Seoul. It was very interactive in that you can be a part of the art and take lovely photos. I would advice going with friends in other to take photos of each other., December 2018
13,5.0,Tacky Fun!!,"This place is so incredibly tacky that you can't help but to have a good time! It was well worth it for the laughs! There's an app you can download to ""enhance"" your experience but it didn't work half the time. There's another tacky Love ""Museum"" upstairs that's very graphic but hilarious...don't bring the kiddos! We had a good time in this cool college neighborhood. Found an awesome craft beer joint around the corner. You can definitely make a whole day checking out Hongdae!", October 2019
14,4.0,"Fun, but not a ""museum""","First, this is not a museum in the conventional sense.  It's a series of wall paintings and mirrors, and other things where a participants can sit, lie, stand, etc in designated locations, and it appears you are flying, being eaten by something, are cut in half etc.  It's more like a well organized carnival fun house.  Overall it was enjoyable.  Not something you can do repeatedly, but it's a good way to spend a couple of hours and take some fun photos.  You NEED to come with someone else to help take pictures or else you are constantly asking people to help you.  The images / illusions are big, so you can't really do it via a selfie.", November 2019
15,3.0,So-So,, October 2019
16,5.0,A different and fun experience,, October 2019
17,4.0,An interesting experience,Had a lot of fun and took some crazy pics. There were indeed some eye bending displays that wow'd me. Was definitely worth it for me., October 2019

19,5.0,Amazed,I have truely enjoyed my visit here. The staffs were welcoming and atmosphere was fun. Next year's round 2. Thank you trick eye., October 2019
20,1.0,Not a museum ,"I’m not sure why this place has received so many positive reviews. It’s a gimmicky place that is reminiscent of a Fun House at a County Fair. However, it is not at all suitable for children.", October 2019
21,5.0,It was fantastic,, October 2019
22,5.0,Trip to Trick Eye Museum (& Love & Ice Museum),"The trip to the Love and Trick Eye Museum made me and my friends laugh the most. It was fun trying out the different illusions in each museum. And both museums have suggestions on the sides on how to pose and markings on where to stand to make sure you take the best pictures possible. However, the love museum is definitely for adults only. But the trick eye museum and ice museum is for practically anybody! It was really cold inside the ice museum so I suggest bringing something warm to wear if you want to last longer than 10 minutes in there. Overall 10/10 would recommend.", October 2019
23,4.0,"fun with the kids, better than expected","a little crowded, but fun to take funny pics. definitely get the app to play with the vr pics. near the new harry potter cafe so a good two activities with lunch in between", May 2019
24,5.0,Trip to Trick Eye (& Love & Ice) Museum,, October 2019
25,5.0,Really fun! Lots of picture options,There’s so many backgrounds to take pictures on so no doubt you’ll get great pictures. They even have certain place marks to stand on to get the best picture and to truly capture the illusion. It was a great opportunity to get some fun pictures with my friends. Highly recommend!, October 2019
26,5.0,Trickeye museum ,, October 2019
27,3.0,Good stop and fun if you have the time,"It is a little time consuming and tedious sometimes, but it is definitely a fun experience. The photos are better without the AR sometimes and the AR APP really drains phone battery. But if you don't mind looking silly and getting down and dirty for pics, it is a lot of fun", October 2019
28,4.0,Good to experience,, September 2019
29,4.0,Love Museum,"It was a fun place to be, hilarious jokes. Can't be serious when visiting the attraction. Very simple, old school jokes. Was a great start to our Korea trip!", October 2019
30,3.0,Dated museum,Only some art pieces are 3d. the rest are normal. this is the 2nd time i come here. Feel so old the place has become., October 2019
31,5.0,Lots of fun!!!,"We had a great time, lots to see and very well laid out, we are an adult couple and highly enjoyed ourselves, it is also a very reasonable price and includes admission to the ice museum.", October 2019
32,4.0,Get the full package! Trick eye museum + ice + one VR game,, October 2019
33,5.0,Great experience at the Trick Eye Museum!,, August 2019
34,5.0,A lot of fun!,"What a fun morning we had here! We bought the ticket that included the Ice Museum and Virtual Reality ride. As we were warm we went into the ice museum first. You are given a plastic poncho to put on because it is very cold. It has ice sculptures and a slide you can go on. We then had the VR ride (chose the rapids ride) before heading into the trick eye museum. This included lots of pictures and sculptures you could become part of via photography. You could download a free app that when you held it in front of the pictures turned them into 3D and made them appear to come alive. We had a ball and laughed heaps. It really was fun! If you are open minded, as we were, I recommend you go the the Love Museum upstairs on your way out...very eye opening!", September 2019
35,4.0,good place to have fun with friends,a good place to have fun with friends in Hongdae. the museum has a lot of 3D arts to trick your eyes and you can have more experiences via the application of the museum., September 2019
36,5.0,Great experience with AR services,"I visited the museum with some friends during chuseok. Never expected to have so much fun in here, the place is divided into 3 sections: ICE, TRICK EYE AND LOVE MUSEUM. The trick eye museum has so many places to take great and fun pictures. PRO TIP: Bring some friends for extra fun.", September 2019
37,5.0,Love it so much!,, September 2019
38,5.0,Fun place in Hongdae!,"I went to the Trick eye Museum with a friend, they have a lot of various interactive pictures thanks to their application. It really feels like you are getting inside of the pictures and they are very realistic! Got a lot of fun staying there. we staid there for around an hour to do everything. A must if you go to hongdae!", September 2019
39,4.0,Unique Art,Being in the Trickeye Museum is like being transported to different places at one time. The 3D art were so unique and I had so much fun taking pictures there., April 2019
40,5.0,good experience at an affordable price,"two people for $22, very reasonable, and the experience was great. We took some of our favorite photos of the entire trip at the trick eye museum, especially the portrait handing the flower and the giant fish-monster (it'll make sense if you go)", August 2019
41,4.0,"Fun place, very reasonably priced","For $11 per person this was a fun experience. We got some pretty memorable photos, probably our favorite on the trip. Worth checking out if you're in the area.", August 2019
42,5.0,Super fun,They have an app that you can download that makes the art come to life. I've never seen anything like it and I imagine that we will soon all over the world. It was really fun (even as two adults). There's also tons of great street food near the venue. Bring change for the lockers., March 2019
43,5.0,amazing museum,"use the app to take animation is funny, can spend at least 2 to 3 hours playing with the animation, during our visit (morning), there was not so many people, it is important, so that we can take photo freely anywhere", May 2019
44,1.0,Worst experience ever!,Do not visit this museum when you are alone. You just loose your money. People working there are extremely unfriendly and not helpfull at all. They refuse to rake even a single picture for you. I payed a lot of money just to be there alone. It has absolutely no meaning visiting this museum if you cant have pictures. I left after the first room. I lost a lot of money for nothing. This museum should get rid of the present people “working” there and start over with a staff that enjoys working with people. Really my worst experience in 3 weeks South Korea!!!, August 2019
45,5.0,download the app for the best videos and pics,"so much fun and unique.  you can download an app that will activate an interactive scene with audio and video, like a dragon roaring and breathing fire with you in front of it.  there are some risque scenes of nudity but nothing you can't laugh off with kids.  there's also an ice museum you can pay in addition to this.", July 2019
46,3.0,Amusing but quickly crowded,, July 2019
47,5.0,Fun place,A very good place to enjoy taking nice funny pictures. It’s good for ppl of all ages who just want to have fun., July 2019
48,5.0,Hilarious,We had such a fun experience here! Kids enjoyed it just as much as the adults. Make sure to download the free interactive app while you’re there. It will make your pictures come to life! Fabulous and well-worth the visit!, July 2019
49,3.0,Fun For Teens,, June 2019
50,5.0,"new corner for photo shooting, many people in there","I had a great time with my friends in the museum. I recommended them to go for taking photos and there is still the supermoon that can take beautiful picture. Friends were surprised to see the AR effect in the APP and it's new to my friends. Also, new corner is added near supermoon which can take pretty photos too.", June 2019
51,5.0,Fun place in Hongdae,It's a cool place in Hongdae to have fun with family! It's good to download the Trickeye carema apps to get 3D effect for the picture!, June 2019
52,5.0,Fun place to visit,, June 2019
53,4.0,The place was fun and interesting,"Using 3D augmented application, photos and videos get interesting and live. Fun place if you go with someone together. With one ticket you can visit both Trick eye museum and Ice museum, and it is worthy enough for 15k won. Ice museum was pretty cool, but make sure you have warm clothes in hand. 26 degree outside, -2 degree inside.", June 2019
54,5.0,"Fun, make sure to take friends!",, June 2019
55,5.0,Very interesting  for both young and aged,"Very interesting using a 3D Augmented Reality App ,  you can film a short video as you become part of the action. It is worth a visit if you have a couple hours to kill especially on a rainy day. Also, included was the Ice musuem  with some interesting ice sculptures in a giant freezer.", May 2019
56,5.0,Fun Attraction,We visited the Trickeye Museum in Seoul and spent a few hours there. It has a downloadable app which activates special effects in most of their displays like a fire-breathing dragon. The app acts as a camera which you use to take photos with the special effects. The Ice Museum was basically a cold storage with ice sculptures which was even too cold for a Canadian! All in all it was great fun for CAD 20., May 2019
57,5.0,great fun,a wonderful few hours at this museum. full of illusions. they have free wifi and an app that helps you fully enjoy it so don't forget to download it for great pictures, April 2019
58,5.0,Great fun,This is a great day out. You will need to download the trickeye app to take full advantage of the various optical illusions they have here., May 2018
59,4.0,TrickEye and ice museum,, April 2019
60,4.0,Family time during Spring Break,"At first I was a bit skeptical as to the level of fun to be had.  My family and I were pleasantly surprised.  We laughed a lot and giggled at many of the resultant pictures and effects.  Downloading their app was a bit annoying; however, the annoyance was quickly replaced with ""oh wow"" and ""so cool"".  The video game section needs to be expanded, plus only one game is included in the full pass.  We went into the ICE museum which is nothing more than a poor replica of a piece of a room from the Ice Village in Sweden or Canada.  We could only stay for about 10 minutes.  It would have been nice if they provided coats so that more time could be had trying to enjoy the ice room.  Overall, it was a good afternoon activity.  It works for families and friends.", April 2019
61,4.0,Fun Place to use up a couple of hours,, March 2019
62,5.0,TrickEye and Ice is innovative!,, March 2019
63,4.0,Fun!! ,"Well, it's fun and all but there isn't much to do in there. You'd literally be done exploring in 15 minutes. I'm being charitable with my review just because I loved their interactive 3D app. Ice museum was boring though...", March 2019
64,5.0,Fun!,Your ticket gets you access to the truck eye museum and the ice museum. After downloading their app 2-d paintings have 3-d movements. It was a lot of fun, March 2019
65,5.0,great experience & had fun in the museum,, March 2019
66,5.0,Even cooler pictures/videos if you use their app!,"I have been to several museums of this kind, but what made this one special was a dedicated app that made the art move or added some elements to the picture. Take someone along so you can take pictures of each other. The entry costs 15,000 won and includes the tiny Ice Museum on the same floor. And while you are here, make sure to go to Love Museum upstairs too!", March 2019
67,4.0,Trick Eye,"Lots of fun--my husband and I are in our 50's and were probably the oldest people there.  BUT it was lots of fun, well worth the cost and the pictures were lots of fun. Lots of laughs, and fighting dinosaurs was adorable", August 2018
68,1.0,Not worth it!,"Bit of a con. Nothing special, actually pretty weak. You have to do the experience using an app which annoyingly runs off your smart phone so drains the battery and definately not suitable for kids. The only interesting part is the VR arcade and they charge extra for that. Avoid!", March 2019
69,5.0,A fun afternoon,"A nice place to go to if you enjoy taking pictures. At the time I went it wasn't too crowded, so pretty easy to take a picture. I believe if I had went at a busy time of the year it would of been difficult to take any pics since people tend to stand around forever and they tend to be in big groups. I also went to the ICE area where you can take pictures of objects made of Ice. It's a nice tourist attraction to spend a few hours.", March 2018
70,4.0,"Great place for kids, teens and those who love to take funny pics",, November 2018
71,3.0,Did not live up to the hype.,"There were a few pictures which were neat, but several were confusing.  It was crowded and made taking pics difficult.  Would not recommend.", February 2019
72,3.0,Know what you’re getting in to ,"So, I went here alone as I was in the neighbourhood shopping and didn’t want to drag my coworker along with me while I browsed 100 beauty stores. I quickly realized that was a big mistake as 98% of this attraction is basically posing with different scenes and taking photos through the museum’s app to create an “optical illusion”. This was quite awkward being alone as I didn’t have anybody to take my photo, not to mention the scenes are quirky and people really get into it (lay on the floor etc.). I’m honestly the kind of person to stand beside a landmark and smile (with a bad fake smile and awkward hands) so all in all not really my cup of tea. But if you enjoy that sort of thing, check this place out! The sample photos were pretty cute. I liked the mirror maze at the end, and the ice museum was a cute (albeit short) experience. This is what I wished I knew before going, so I hope it helps you make your decision!", February 2019
73,3.0,It's quite okay~,"It's quite okay, but I think the place is kind of over priced just for you to take unique and 3D photos. But if you're the type who love to have tons of photo updates in your social media, then you might love the visit to this place.", October 2018
74,4.0,Great!,I went here and it was nice. There are many different attractions to see and do. Go here for some photos and fun time with your family and friends., February 2019
75,1.0,Definitely the worst experience ever ,"What ever you do, do not visit the Trickeye Museum. It is cheaply constructed and there are barely any optical illusions. All of us in our group were highly disappointed.", February 2019
76,5.0,So coooool!,Me and my wife went to the trick eye museum and ice museum. There is an AR to download for free. With the AR app things looks much more realistic and I highly recommend you to check this museum out if you are in Hongdae!, January 2019
77,5.0,Very funny:),"It's interesting and I enjoyed my visit there. It's really only for photo taking so if you're not a fan of having photos taken, then don't go, as it's not much fun only looking. I went on my own and I was lucky visitors there were happy to take a photo of me when I asked them. There will be a lady who tells you to sit for oil painting photo free trial. However as with everything what's for free, this isn't for free. You will only see the oil painted photo for free, the print outs must be paid then of course. But overall an interesting experience. Make sure you download their app prior to the visit - it's even more fun :) Someone mentioned here the love museum entry is included in the Trickeye Museum ticket. It's not. You need to pay separately for both museums despite they're in the same building only on different floors.", January 2019
78,4.0,Interesting concept,This was a very unique experience.  The interactive displays automatically link to your phone once you download their app.  Recommended for a few hours., December 2018
79,3.0,An OK way to spend an hour of your time.,"The trick eye museum is great to take pictures in with friends, but it isn't overwhelmingly fun. It is only a small distance from Hongdae exit 9 which is handy - but I would only recommend it to kill 45 mins to an hour of your time if you are doing something else in Hongdae.", January 2019
80,5.0,Great Experience,"Visitors can enjoy taking tricky pictures/videos using a mobile application, the photos seem so real. So funny place", January 2019
81,4.0,Must to go,"Really fun and you can spend more than two hours to take the photos.  Please remember to download the app before you take any photos and also put your backpack to the locker, just 500 won.  Just take your wallet and camera is good enough.", November 2018
82,3.0,the tackiest thing i have ever been to,"Its just awful. Do i regret going? im not sure, Its so bizarre. I was embarrassed in there and left with in 5 mins. The photos... well i won't be showing them on our holiday pic slide show. Was it worth it? It was different, fairly cheap hilarious to watch others and just a bit disturbing.", December 2018
83,5.0,Amazing!!,"Great place! A lot of fun, its incredible that this is the first on america! Bring your hole family and a full loaded battery so you can enjoy it properly.", January 2019
84,5.0,So much fun!,"This experience is so much fun. My husband and I visited this place. We will be visiting again and this time, with the kids. They will surely enjoy this. Get ready with your acting skills.", November 2018

We did have pleasant surprises from using this fantastic app.  By using this app, dinosaurs are moving, angels are flying, pictures are blinking and more surprises going on ...", December 2018
88,3.0,Nice place to visit. ,"It is a nice place to visit especially if it's too cold to do something outdoors. It's pricey (much more expensive than the pass to see all palaces) and you must bring your own smartphone to ""see"" the CGI on the screen. Internet connection is sometimes slow, so you must wait some time to download the illusions to the smartphone. I think this place is more targeted for children.", December 2018
89,4.0,Cool activity,Nice experience. We had a lovely day at this wierd museum. We took a lot of great photos we can post on social media, December 2018
90,5.0,Very entertaining,"The museum is very funny. You gotta download the app to properly enjoy the animations. If you are in a group, would vê better to take group pictures. It has a Nice mirror room at the end!", December 2018

101,4.0,Fun-filled experience,"It was one of our bucket list when in Seoul.  Fortunately, we were lucky to have guided by two students to reach Trick Eye Museum by foot from the train station.  Then we had the best experience inside it.  Somehow it amazed me on the 3D walls and floors....it was an unforgettable experience.", May 2018

110,5.0,amazing place,trick eye museum is really a nice place that every one coming to Korea should visit for taking photos, November 2018
111,3.0,Good place to while away the time,We had fun re-creating photographs. You can blend and interact with the paintings. The Ice museum is an extra treat., November 2018
112,5.0,Mind-blowing art that defies gravity and tickles your your senses!,, December 2017
113,3.0,Companion is needed,Long walk from Hongik Station.  They have apps for a much more realistic picture.  You must have a companion to take your picture or bring a tripod to take your shot, November 2018
114,4.0,AR photo was so real! Don't miss to have a cup of coffee with your photo,, November 2018
115,5.0,Great place for taking photos,There are lots of 3D wall paintings for selfie and group photos. The mirror maze was quite tricky and some paintings would become animated with phone application. Highly recommended, November 2018
116,4.0,Neat and cool illusional art! ,"The illusional art paintings are pretty nice! The app which makes the art animated is also neat, but if you try taking photos, it’s a bit blurry (doesn’t focus). The only recommendation I’d make is at least have one or two staff around so they can help take photos for you? Cause it’s nice and neat, but would be neater if you can actually be in the photo, but it’s difficult if there’s nobody to take photos for you!", November 2018
117,1.0,It's a trap!,"Ok, so the only trick here is that they Rob you of 15000 won. We thought it was gonna be a illusion art exhibition, but it's silly bad animation all through an app on your phone, and it's all done in like 15 minutes. If you don't wanna be tricked for your money, stay away!!", November 2018
118,5.0,Just the most enjoyable experience,, November 2018
119,4.0,"Super Fun, Something Different!","It was somewhat busy when I came here, but the rooms are big with a few different paintings per room. I opted not to download the app, just to focus on pictures, I think you'll have a great time with or without the app. Make sure to come here with friends, the whole point is to have a good time and get creative with photos. The wide range of paintings was fabulous, they ranged from everything to scary and funny to gross and weird. If you have time while on vacation and looking for something creative, give the Trickeye Museum a try!", October 2018
