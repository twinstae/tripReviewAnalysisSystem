0,5.0,Absolutely worth a visit and so much fun!,"We had such a great time here. There is an App you download when you go in which brings the place to life.

A",1,29, January 2020,"Sydney, Australia"
1,5.0,Really cool place,This place is a lot of fun! I was traveling alone so I got a guide to accompany me so I could get some great photos. They have an app that works with some of the exhibits to get you some really cool videos and photos. ,4,20, September 2019,"Saint Louis, Missouri"
2,5.0,Worth it!,"The ice museum on the side is not really worth a visit, especially if you have seen ice sculptures elsewhere. Little kids would love it though. The Trick Eye concept is very clever - though sharing your photos with them might be risky. It is only 12000w entry, and a nice",25,54, December 2019,"Sarikei, Malaysia"
3,3.0,Need to go with a teen or 20 something,"I visited this attraction with my wife and teenage daughters. I would not call it a museum but rather, an attraction. I am in my early 50s and don't have an intuitive understanding of how to manipulate the VR to maximum effect. My daughter, on the other hand, is masterful.",279,306, December 2019,"New York City, New York"
4,4.0,"Worth trying , covered with discover Seoul pass ","It’s about 5 mins walk from Hongik University stop exit 9, a bit difficult to find the building name as it isn’t clearly visible and my Google maps hung up on me !

5,5.0,Trick eye Museum,Small place but worth the little money you spend. First time I have been to a place like this and my wife and I had a good time.

6,4.0,Quite a tricky attraction to eye out,"Had some trouble finding this attraction  because it is located in a building without a clear and obvious sign. After figuring out which building it was then also had the difficult of finding the entrance which is at the basement of the building, which it shares with another",62,529, December 2019,"Singapore, Singapore"
7,2.0,Not great.,"The trickeye portion is ok but I expected all pictures to have AR effects, not just 4. The VR portion was very bad. The only ride that was working for 2 people was a roller coaster. There are so many boring VR rollercoasters and this is one of them. All other rides were broken",2,6, December 2019,"Makati, Philippines"

11,1.0,Not a museum ,"I’m not sure why this place has received so many positive reviews. It’s a gimmicky place that is reminiscent of a Fun House at a County Fair. However, it is not at all suitable for children. ",16,78, October 2019,"Tyler, Texas"
12,4.0,"fun with the kids, better than expected","a little crowded, but fun to take funny pics. definitely get the app to play with the vr pics. near the new harry potter cafe so a good two activities with lunch in between",129,232, May 2019,"Barcelona, Spain"
13,4.0,Good to experience,"This is a place for selfie lovers, photographers... the technology is really cool to experience, can get a little frustrating as some people walk into your frame right as your about to take the pic.

15,5.0,A lot of fun!,What a fun morning we had here! We bought the ticket that included the Ice Museum and Virtual Reality ride. As we were warm we went into the ice museum first.

18,5.0,amazing museum,"use the app to take animation is funny, can spend at least 2 to 3 hours playing with the animation, during our visit (morning), there was not so many people, it is important, so that we can take photo freely anywhere ",6,9, May 2019,"Hong Kong, China"
19,1.0,Worst experience ever!,Do not visit this museum when you are alone. You just loose your money. People working there are extremely unfriendly and not helpfull at all. They refuse to rake even a single picture for you. I payed a lot of money just to be there alone. It has absolutely no meaning visiting,8,19, August 2019,"Menen, Belgium"
20,3.0,Amusing but quickly crowded,"The visit was very interesting, some optical illusions were quite impressive and funny.

23,5.0,Very interesting  for both young and aged,"Very interesting using a 3D Augmented Reality App ,  you can film a short video as you become part of the action.

Also, included was the Ice musuem  with some interesting ice sculptures in a giant",16,43, May 2019,"Waterloo, Canada"
24,5.0,Fun Attraction,We visited the Trickeye Museum in Seoul and spent a few hours there. It has a downloadable app which activates special effects in most of their displays like a fire-breathing dragon. The app acts as a camera which you use to take photos with the special effects.

It’s very creative an",53,146, March 2019,"Chicago, Illinois"
30,4.0,Fun!! ,"Well, it's fun and all but there isn't much to do in there. You'd literally be done exploring in 15 minutes. I'm being charitable with my review just because I loved their interactive 3D app. Ice museum was boring though... ",3,73, March 2019,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"

34,3.0,Know what you’re getting in to ,"So, I went here alone as I was in the neighbourhood shopping and didn’t want to drag my coworker along with me while I browsed 100 beauty stores.

35,3.0,It's quite okay~,"It's quite okay, but I think the place is kind of over priced just for you to take unique and 3D photos. But if you're the type who love to have tons of photo updates in your social media, then you might love the visit to this place.",33,91, October 2018,"Bangkok, Thailand"

39,3.0,An OK way to spend an hour of your time.,"The trick eye museum is great to take pictures in with friends, but it isn't overwhelmingly fun. It is only a small distance from Hongdae exit 9 which is handy - but I would only recommend it to kill 45 mins to an hour of your time if you are doing something else in Hongdae.
