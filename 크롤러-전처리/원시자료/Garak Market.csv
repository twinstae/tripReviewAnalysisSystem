0,4.0,Beef and seafood,"Visited the seafood, dried food, beef and kimchi sections.   Tried different kinds of shells. Clams were fresh.   Raw fish was above average. Abalone was not particularly fresh.   Beef was good.   We were introduced to a restaurant at the basement by the seafood store. Service", January 2020
1,4.0,Very Good Price for Seafood and Not Touristy ,"It needs a bit of walk from the nearest metro station (same name Garak Market) which station is not at city centre where the actions are taken (50 mins from Jongno-gu station). We need to walk through some openair wholesale vegetables and fruits markets before reaching this seafood market But the walk is worthy. We bought and bargained for fresh seafood including King crab, scallops, clams, abalones etc. They were kind enough to give us some more seafood for free. The raw seafood were steamed on the spot at the market on ground floor where we bought but served on upper floor inside a restaurant. Sat on floor/ tatami which was a challenge to me. There are some extra charges for the dishes of kimchi. We ate much to our satisfaction and price was only about USD 100. We will be back!", July 2019

3,4.0,A very clean seafood market ,"We went there for lunch on a Saturday. Many local people than tourists were there. We first bought our fresh seafood from the wet market on the ground floor, then we went to the second floor to get a restaurant to cook the seafood for us. Prices were affordable and reasonable. We like this wet market as it is very clean and less touristic compared to Noryangjin fish market. The only issue was its location. It is a bit far away from Myeongdong.", October 2018
4,5.0,Garak fish market,"Walking 1.5 kmâ€™s from hotel arrived initially at fruit market and a little further we came upon dried food market , fresh messy and then the fish market walked around for some 15 minutes and purchased some fish and still shelled  muscles etc. quality of food good as majority of fish slice and/or fresh. You can purchase these and then go upstairs and have them cooked.  Relatively cheaper than outside and you can see the fish prior to purchasing.  We arrived around 5.15pm on a Monday and it was relatively quiet", November 2018
5,3.0,Pushy,"My husband and I were staying at an AirBNB close to Garak Market so we decided to check it out. We did not buy anything but the people working were really hustling for you to buy something. You couldn't even really look around without them trying to sell their produce in a very pushy manner. There also is a strong language barrier, so I'd suggest bringing a friend along that can help translate for you.", October 2018
6,4.0,Seafood seafood,"There are three seafood markets in Seoul, Garak Market is the one far from city center at the south of the river. This was picked for my dining option after visiting Common Ground, which is along the way of subway.Having done some online research, despite Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market is the most famous market, many feedbacks are negative for the extra high price for tourists and there are occasions report on fraud.Garak Market has an official website with price per kg of seafood listed which made things more easy.There are very few tourists, I went to a restaurant upstairs first, where I seeked the staff to go with me shop for seafood downstairs. The food are delicious. King crab and fish soup are must try.", April 2018
7,5.0,Be Adventurous,"One of the best nights I had in Korea. Lets put it this way..... you just have to be willing to go through the hustle and make it work. NO, they don't treat tourists the same but I understand why. This fish market is for locals and they are looking to make money and not entertain. So bring the cash and enjoy an amazing fresh seafood dinner. After you haggle them for the price, they will take it upstairs to the restaurant which they work with and you simple just let them know how you want your meal cooked. That's it.I was so blessed that night with meeting the most amazing Korean's at the table sitting next to me. The night turned out to be a huge 3 hour party. Good Times...", March 2018
8,3.0,It would be better if you bring a local friend along,"Me and friend went to Garak Market, but we did not eat there because we were avoiding disappointment due to misunderstanding between us the tourists and the stalls.", December 2017
9,4.0,Fresh seafood ,"Local seafood market . You can buy the seafood then bring to restaurant, they will cook for you as what you want with cooking charges.", November 2017
10,1.0,Gangsters and Crooks and Korean police absolutely no help,"Family of four visiting the Garak market for a supposedly fun day. However, upon entering, it turned out to be the worst day of our trip.  Starting from the entrance, fish mongers block and hassle your every step.  They badger, touch, and grab as you walk by their stalls. I've seen pushy sales people before, but this was just wrong.  One particularly aggressive, red-faced fish monger accused us of accepting to buy his fish. We did nothing of the sort - mind you, we were using a Korean phrasebook - but as we started to walk away, he ran over and grabbed me. I shook him off and started to walk away. Just when we thought it couldn't get any worse, one of his workers - a crazed old lady in her 60's went ballistic and started swearing at us. I'm not sure if she was drunk or insane, but as we walked away she followed us for about 200 feet cursing and yelling at us. When we turned and attempted to calm her down, she went ballistic and hit my wife with a closed fist on her arm and then hit me on the back as I tried to shield my wife from the assault. My children (7 years old) started crying and then the crazed lady actually hit me again! I was a little stunned, but by this time, there was a large crowd of other fish mongers who started to gather around us. I really didn't feel safe after having noticed a couple of the fish mongers holding large knives!  I grabbed my wife and kids and beat a hasty retreat to the exit.Outside, we called the police. BTW, the police emergency number in Korea is 112.When the police arrived, we went back in with the police and confronted the crazed lady. She admitted to hitting us. However, - get this - the police basically said this was the culture in fish markets in Korea! Wow! Just wow!We called the US consulate and left a report. Here's the number 2397-4114.Moral of the story: If you are a foreigner and don't mind getting roughed up in a market and having unprofessional police who provide no protection and think its just a big joke, go to Garak Market. Otherwise, avoid like the plague.", July 2017
11,4.0,Garak Wholesale Market,"I went to this market about 3 years a go. I come here only for walks and see the atmosphere around. This market is so broad. Variety of agricultural and fishery products are available here. The thing that make me amaze is this market is very clean, as traditional market. I do not smell the stench, but a distinctive aroma of fresh fish.", December 2015
12,4.0,Garak Market ,"There are some restaurants around the area, especially for sea food. A shopping mall around the area, nice, not too loud place to relax and go for a walk", August 2016
13,4.0,Cheap seafood and large fruit market,This market is not close to the city.  And the seafood is much cheaper the one in the city.Nice and friendly people.  It took us around 45 mins to get there by railway from Myeong Dong.  Great nice place.  You may find some fresh fruits there too.  We had a lunch there and we had two set lunches which already filled our stomach., August 2016
14,5.0,Cheaper and better seafood market,"This place isn't exactly close to the city but it is close to an outlet street and Lotte mart (both near Garak station) as well as Lotte World (the theme park situated in another station nearby).  The market is huge and I got a bit lost when I got out of metro.  The exit which is closest to the market has closed so I just got out of the station following the sign.  It was so new and nice when I saw a building with the seafood signboard.  I entered and I was like.... what the..... there was only 2 shops with live seafood and further down there was 1 shop that sells traditional Korean preserved food..... all the rest of the place has ponds of running water with NOTHING in it. I was like oh crap (originally thinking of crab), I took 40mins of train to a market with nothing?!  I didn't eat in the seafood restaurant (one area with different vendors I guess... all in Korean, illegible for me) next to it.  I know there should be wholesale fruit market too so may as well as just take a look....  After about 10mins walk I found another fish market, which was the ORIGINAL Garak market!!! The place feels a lot more like a fish market with all those smells of salty and fishery smell.  Before I came here I visited blogs recommending one shops.  They all look almost identical but glad that there is a different number on top of each stores.  I walked around and managed to found it.  The reason I look for this shop is because the blogger mentioned that he can speak Chinese.  I doubt anyone here can communicate in English in a local fish market... particularly hard to ask for something.... The guy is very nice and gave me some freebies after I selected a small size crab.  I asked him to take me a place where they will do the cooking for a fee.  I'm glad he was there as I was too early (10:30am) and none of the shops were officially start doing business yet.  He helped me out to request to cook for me.  I bought 90,000w for the crab and the food processing fee was 12,000w only (i had to pay an extra 2,000 (I think) as they charge a fixed fee of 2,000 per person starting from 2 persons).  P.S. This place will be moving to the empty seafood market I mentioned in the beginning this year (I think May or June 2016).  It will be cleaner and closer to the metro station. Hopefully, the price for seafood remains the same.", April 2016
15,5.0,Great seafood,"This market is less known to foreigners than the one in Noryangjin market and less tourist friendly.  Yet the seafood is as fresh and the price is in general cheaper than that of Noryangjin.  It is better if you could speak a bit mandarin or Korean if you would like to bargain for better price.  We ate at the restaurant advised by the lady who sold us the seafood and the seafood were fresh, delicious and well cooked.   We tried Alaska crab, abalone and different shellfish as well as fresh octopus sashimi (moving throughout the night!) It is also fun to walk round the market as you will be amazed at the variety of seafood that have.  Would recommend to seafood lovers.", December 2015
16,5.0,It never ends!,"Row upon row of everything edible (and some I wasn't sure of). Walked a 4 km row that had nothing but vegetables, crossed over and walked 4km back with every fruit imaginable. Then we entered the fish market where we could choose any stage of the life cycle (baby octopus, full grown flounder & crab, ready-to-eat filets and eel, dried squid, etc.)  Choose your fish and the in-house restaurant will prepare. Many shops will even vacuum pack dried goods for shipping. Great values.", August 2015
