The famous coex aquarium is situated within this mall. This mall has many entrance gates. It remains open till 10 pm  (some of the shops start closing at 9:30 pm) after that only the restaurants remain open till 11. Many of the good restaurant s too close by 9:30 pm. So its better to visit this mall early in the evening. This mall houses many local as well as international brands. It is also a good place to buy some souvenirs though it will be a little costly.

The mall is massive: there are lots of stores and restaurants that we didn't have time to check out. What I liked about this mall was the underground passage that connected to the mall. We were there during Christmas and it was snowing, but due to the underground walkways we were able to cross to the other side without any difficulties from the weather.", December 2016

119,2.0,Disappointing,"Yes, it is large, but the walking areas are very broad and the stores are big too, so there weren't as many shops as I expected.

120,3.0,Clean mall full of chain stores,"So, this is a mall, and it has lots of large retailers. There's an aquarium (separate listing) and a cinema, and it is across the street from a temple, and has its own metro stop, but it's not really worth a visit if you are coming from somewhere that has average large retail stores.", June 2017

There is no organization to the placement of the stores.  I would go there only if I've exhausted all the shopping options in Seoul.", March 2017
128,2.0,Didn't like it much! üòï,Ok I wouldn't call it the hidden gem of Seoul . The shops are expensive and I wouldn't have even visited the place if it weren't for a meeting near by.

Of course, it is a very touristy spot that can get crowded at times with tourists, haha, but we spent more than 5 hours there! It's so big that my feet hurt from walking at the end of the visit but we were able to see the aquarium (very unique and ~21 USD), do a VR roller coaster ride, play arcade games, shop for 40 mins, eat ramen, check out their architecture, and eat the best green tea ice cream! Shops range from buyable for the average middle class person to luxury brands to souvenir shops to random trinkets! I suggest getting a map! Definitely enjoyed the visit minus the insane amount of obnoxious tourists but definitely fun if you like aquariums, shopping, people watching, arcades, movies, you name it. It's underground so perfect during hot or cold weather days.", August 2016

It was a 7 minute ride from seongsu station here.  The mall is  2 levels, but there is a mini level by the aquarium hidden in a corner with eateries there too.  Very bright and clean looking throughout.  Many clothing stores.  There is a large good court too.  Also, a movie theatre and aquarium.  Aquarium was very good on the other night.  It closes at 8 pm with ticketing ending at 7.  We got lost trying to find our way back from the aquarium one night, but discovered the food court which had lots of seating and some nice options.  Here we ate bulgogi and noodle soup with galbi short ribs.", October 2016

The layout is daunting at first, but just keep walking and you'll be pleasantly surprised at the flow of the massive space.  We found a healthy variety of common western brands and unique local ones, from luxury goods to discount stores that sell cell phone accessories.  Similarly the food options are numerous.  A whole day is barely enough to enjoy all the shops and amenities of this shopping complex.  It's conveniently accessible via subway too!", December 2016

151,5.0,Very posh and high end but really beautiful!,"It's a really huge mall. It's so easy to get lost inside it. But everything you need is here. From Korean and international clothes and cosmetics to food and services. This mall is in the same building as the exhibition halls so it's really convenient if you have an event to attend since you can just walk around while waiting. It's also connected to the City Airport  so after checking in your baggage and going through immigration, you can go around the mall while waiting for the bus that takes you to either Incheon or Gimpo airport.", October 2016

Since this is Korea, the mall does have a lot of skin care, make-up and beauty stores.  Many of the shops in Myeongdong are also in Coex.  There are who stores and fashion stores and a lot of restaurants.  There are high end shops but also bargain places like Daiso.  What I wish they had though was bookstores and shops for stationery, pens and art materials.  For a tourist who has to attend a convention in the nearby Coex convention centre, this is a good place to shop.  Also a good place to get gifts to bring home.", September 2016

158,4.0,huge,"This is a huge underground mall which has a stature of gangnam style hands outside which is a tourist op. Inside has a money change bank , lots of food places, subway access. and of course commercial shops. Good to spend half  a day if the weather outside is too extreme. But it is very commercial. Doesn't represent the true culture or Korean style in my opinion. So a couple of hours is the most you should spend here.
