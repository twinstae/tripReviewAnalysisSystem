0,5.0,"Love it here, even in the chilling winter","I visited Some Sevit a few times in the summer and now in the winter. Though it was a cold February day, I really enjoyed walking around here. I came during the early afternoon, and stayed at one of the cafes to wait for the sunset and I’m glad I did, as the sky was beautiful", February 2020

3,3.0,Come in the evening to make your trip worthwhile ,There is a shuttle bus you can take at exit 6 of Express Bus Terminal station to bring you here.

Believe the view and the lights will make it worthwhile to visit this place in the evening. So do come in the evening., April 2019

7,5.0,Very nice view,These awesome islands are famous for the 'Avengers: Age of ultron'. We were just riding the bicycle then suddenly encountered these beautiful islands. The light is so spectacular and there are several places for chillimg. My girlfriend also loved it., July 2017
8,4.0,Good break,"I can see why the #floatingislands, or #somesevit, are an attraction. I went early in the morning and avoided the crowds. It’s a nice area to take a stroll, with lots of shops and seating area along the water to enjoy a coffee or snack (me and food). One can even rent a floating picnic boat for up to 6 people and enjoy an afternoon on the water, or head in front of the islands and sit in the park, watching people picnic and flying kites", October 2017
9,4.0,Great night view of Some Sevit (세빛섬),"This is not necessarily marketed as a 'tourist attraction', but we were recommended to visit Some Sevit (세빛섬) to take advantage of the lovely ambiance at night. It is not necessarily the easiest place to get to, but it is about a 15 minute walk from Express Bus Terminal station. It was a nice area with bike lanes and open space for everyone to have a nice stroll by the Han river - I could imagine this being a popular destination during the summer. The three floating islands were beautifully lit in various colours and changing patterns. Night view was spectacular and a great photo opp.", March 2017
10,4.0,Nice park,"Very nice park.  Lots people sit on the grass, have picnic or just enjoy the view.  There is also a children's playground and bike rental.", March 2017
11,3.0,"Artificial structure which is ""floating"" on Han-Gang(river)","It was cold outside with wind, but I felt that it would be good for having some time with friends or family in that area. Sebitseom(""seom"" means island. In this case, islet) is a connected artificial islet that consisted with three structures. Gabit, Solbit and Chaebit. ""Se"" of ""Sebitseom"", I guess this would be their intention, means ""three(3)"" in Korean. We could find some restaurents, gallery, convenience store. Actually we visited an exhibition on ""artists of Impressionism"", and the place looks good for a small exhibition. It seems that many would love to visit there at twilight and enjoy breeze and openness of Han river in Spring and autumn.", December 2016

13,4.0,Nice vibe but could be less crowded,It was nice to have a dinner and enjoy Han river. But I think the place doesn't have its own colour. Another typical Korean dining and shopping areas... I think Seoul city official needs to be more strategic to plan this place., August 2016
