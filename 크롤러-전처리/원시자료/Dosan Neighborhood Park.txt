3,4.0,Gorgeous Park,"I really liked the greenery and the peacefulness of the park, there's also exercise machines for you to exercise on.", April 2016
4,4.0,Memorial park ,"So the Koreans have been attacked so many times that they have a real quest to build a Korean National Identity and as part of that they have to celebrate their national heroes. When Gangum was still just padi fields, they had a big burial ceremony for Dosun who did great things for Education of Koreans and a national fighter. It's really nice to learn and see a little bit of the history in action. The park is now in the midst of a really trendy Neighbourhood and it's quite amazing to see all these Korean flags flying high. The park itself is small and more of a memorial - but I could see children out with their cycles etc.", June 2016
