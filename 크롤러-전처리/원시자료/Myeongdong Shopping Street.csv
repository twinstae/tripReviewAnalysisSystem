23,1.0,A Street that Shows the True Face of South Korea.,"Well, I rarely go ballistic on a particular place but here I have to admit enough is enough. Certain things look and are cute when you are 8 or 12, but start getting creepy when you are in your 20's, 30's and over. The phenomena I have witness in South Korea is one of alarming growth, similar to any virus coming from this region. I need to clarify that in my book; that the great majority of young South Korean teenagers and South Korean young adults, are truly immature and infantile. Bordering creepy. Therefore in this vein, I had the heartbreaking experience to witness whilst visiting this Myeongdong Shopping Street a crowd of such. Guys and girls in their 20's and 30's and in some occasions over this dressed like dolls, K-Pop artists, with fake eye colors, hair colors, skin colors, trying desperately to be seen or found by a K-Pop recruiting scout. I witnessed the obsessive adoration of K-pop male singers that all insist in looking like girls and do not get me started with the obsession with all of them going back to Teddy Bear land. I have seen in this street type places and other places in Seoul even Safety Instructions for Adults presented with girls portraying little girls, dressed with teddy bear themes and in this street if you had an unfulfilled childhood all your dreams come true. I am not talking stores for children, but stores for the creep that wants to look like one.In the Myeongdong Shopping Street all you find is creams for the face, fake eyes and stuff of the kind, cheap Made in China garbage that will last one or two uses and disgusting Street Food that is either too sweet, too spicy or too salty. For God sake I stopped in a sandwich place to have a bite and the ham and cheese sandwich instead of having mayo or any other savory sauce between the layers; it had Italian meringue. Meaning: whipped white of eggs with sugar (literally disgusting).And do not get me started on the prices of anything and everything I just mentioned. I mean off the hook expensive. The sandwich in question was 10.000 KW each = some 10 US$ each. for white bread, meringue, cheap ham and cheap cheddar. This people is literally crazy.Additionally, last and not least, the streets are crowded, the cars do not respect pedestrians, the streets are filthy dirty and NO ONE SPEAKS ENGLISH. What's up with that?Also Korea is a vain culture: I don’t think there’s anything wrong with the occasional selfie, but Koreans take it to the next level. It’s not uncommon to sit in a coffee shop next to a table of adult women staring into their front-facing cameras, moving the device around to various angles for very long periods of time. The goofiest part is the fact that they aren’t always taking photographs – they’re sometimes just staring at themselves in silence for minutes on end. My wife put it best when she said, “I don’t know who is  staring at them more: me or themselves.” Korea is internationally known as the plastic surgery capital of the world – and not in a good way. They are literally stupid whilst walking in the streets and bump on you because they are staring at the mirrors, doing make up whilst they walk, staring at the phone and gaming like zombies.Finally South Koreans if you are not one of theirs, they are out and out rude and xenophobic overall. Very strange attitude for a country that rely on foreign Western security to prevent them from being attacked from the big bad wolf from the North. Very strange indeed........Go of you wish to see all these things and be ripped off and treated like garbage whilst you buy some too. Be my guest! Too sad that a country with such great heritage, has decided to show you the superficial side of human beings. Too sad.", January 2020
24,5.0,Heaven for makeup and beauty junkies!,"Although it was fun to eat the street food, I found it better to eat in some random Korean BBQ restaurant. What makes this place are the makeup and beauty stores. My goodness you will never realize how much skin care and hair care you need (or think you need) until you enter one of these stores. My personal favorite was Tony Moly. If you aren't careful you can blow you entire budget on that street.", January 2020

26,3.0,Way too crowded... and dirty,"If you plan on shopping for k-beauty here, make sure you come before 2pm. Once the markets start it gets crazy busy. On the first night we thought it was a novelty but we quickly realised that some of the food wasn't as cheap as we thought. Some of them vendors reheat food by using those gas flame lighters so they're not fresh off the grill or reheated on it. As well as it being unbelievably busy, there was rubbish everywhere, it was a bit of a turn off. Worth a visit if you're into k-beauty though but wouldn't come here just for the food stalls. There are some decent restaurants around too in the area.", December 2019
27,3.0,Snacks on the street,"There were always a lot of people. We were only interested in snacks. Pretty expensive. Would recommend going to the local markets instead. For example, a box of strawberries was sold at W15000 here and only W3500 at Mangwon market...Nevertheless, it was a place with different variety of restaurants and shops.", January 2020

You can have lunch and dinner at different restaurants every day/night (assuming your hotel provides breakfast).  Lots of cosmetic shops, with vendors giving out free facial masks in front of their stores, in hopes to wheel you in.  Some restaurants have a 2nd or 3rd floor, so do go in and check with host/hostess for availability, and don't just assume there's no seating when the main floor is full.  There are lots of street vendors along Myeongdong-Ro (St) where they sell gimbaps, deep fried squids, etc...which you may fancy.  For tourists, you will find good exchange rates in this area too.  When we were there during Xmas/New Year, there were huge sales everywhere in Myeongdong shopping street… good time to go :)", December 2019
38,5.0,Love it went twice in one year as first time I could not see everything,"The people are friendly, although when they look like they are handing out samples of things, they are not, they will pull it back and tell you go into store.

But my favorite was really trying all the different foods.", May 2019

45,5.0,amazing,This area has all the beauty shops.  Masks for every part of your body.  Bought loads to take home to australia as it is all so cheap.  Did not feel ripped off.  Do your homework first as to what you want as it can be very over whelming.  Evening food markets are amazing every thing was so good that we tried.

49,4.0,Great shopping street,"We were in Seoul overnight and wanted to shop for their wonderful Korean beauty products. We stayed at a hotel near Incheon and debated whether to take the AREX Incheon Airport Express train from the airport or uber.  The one way train ticket was definitely cheaper at 9,000 South Korean won compared to the $75 USD uber but we opted for the uber due to time constraints.  Taking the shuttle back to the airport, finding the express train, and coordinating the train schedule plus a transfer to Myeongdong Street from Seoul Station seemed too much of a hassle and time consuming.  Travel time was between 45-60 minutes.Be prepared for the crowds since this was one of the main shopping/tourist streets.  The stores accept credit cards but have SK won for the street vendors.  We found ATMs in the area.  We tried some of the street food but after awhile tired of the greasy fried food.  There were some rather unique concoctions: fish shaped waffles, dumplings with red bean paste, and seasoned chicken/rice cakes to name a few.We were there for the beauty products and found Innisfree to have the best selections.  We loved: Jeju orchid enriched cream, green tea seed serum, green tea seed eye cream, volcanic pore clay masks, wrinkle cream and of course the masks.  The jellyfish vital mask was one of my favorites.  Credit cards were accepted plus duty free was an option with a passport.  These products can be ordered online but was cheaper in the stores.What was interesting about this area was that there were literally no garbage cans to throw away wrappers etc. from the street food.Fun experience and felt very safe in the area.", December 2019

58,5.0,Incredible,"This is the place you have to visit if you are in Seoul. I went here almost every day whilst I was in Korea (for two weeks). There is so much here for everyone, in terms of beauty, music, niknaks, food etc. I would 100% recommend going here at night for the market, it is a once in a lifetime experience. The two best things I found in Myeongdong were - Nanta Theatre and Underground shopping centre. The Nanta theatre was absolutely hilarious and can be loved by people of all ages. The underground shopping centre - found when going into the myeongdong subway station, was okay, there wasnt much there other than niknaks and socks, but there are a few kpop album shops there with such a large range of albums, all for very cheap. I'm from the UK and albums here (mainly bought through amazon) cost 4/5 times more than what I found here. I spent over £1000 on albums whilst here, and actually got my moneys worth, wheras in the UK this would have gotten me 30 albums at the most.", August 2019
59,5.0,Could easily lose a day here so much to see and explore. ,Very interesting place to wonder around. So many shops and side streets full of shops. So many Korean beauty products and also Tom’s flavoured Almond shops. Also there is also a big Art box here as well. It gets busy during the day but that is nothing compared to nighttime when all the street food vendors come out. Please be careful because people will just push and shove when it’s really busy.

Honestly i didnt go into any of the cosmetics store who offered free masks (only if you go into the store).

In the evening, there will be lots and lots of vendors selling street food. Price of food in this area are generally more expensive than other places like Hongdae, Ehwa Woman’s Univ and Namdaemun Market. Streets are usually packed even on weekdays.Am giving it a 3 star because i am not into cosmetics and i think the prices are a more expensive too. I think this place is overrated, though i must say there are some pretty good eateries around eg Migabon (portion is smaller than Bon Juk but i found it nicer than Bon Juk) Myeongdong Kyoja (their dumplings are superb) and Yoogane Chicken Galbi. Apart from cosmetics, there are of course other shops/ mart selling other korean food eg almonds, potato chips etc", December 2019

Fila stores are almost everywhere and the shoes are a bargain. Vendors start to setup their carts only around 3pm onwards so will be better to go there after 3pm to soak in the ambience. Hard to find rubbish bin so keep all your trash before disposing them properly. Train station is nearby as well, so will be a good experience to take the public transport.

As for street food, it’s rather pricey, and sometimes prices vary from stall to stall. A stick of fish cake can cost krw 1000 to krw 4000. I tried grilled scallop which cost krw 10000. The shell was huge but contained very little meat, swimming in cheese. I felt I was eating cheese alone. The cheese hotdog was nice but you need to ignore the colour of oil used to fry it. Dark brown oil- recycled many times. Common sight at stalls that sell deep fried food. Stalls sell more or less the same type of food. Always ask for the price first.", December 2019

103,5.0,Go at night!!!,"Sure, you can go during the day but at night this place truly comes alive, especially on weekends.  About 3 blocks square, the food stalls congregate along one strip and it is on this strip that we spent most of our time as we are foodies.  From live octopus to egg cake, fruit smoothies to scallops in large seashells, the choices are endless and a veritable taste sensation.  Prices are reasonable to a tad pricey for what you get but where else can you have so much selection in such a condensed space.We also had a Korean massage for a reasonable price but it is a dry massage through towels and a hospital-like gown; more of a pressure point session than a true massage... a bit of a disappointment.The stores offer packaged almonds, dragon's beard candy, ice cream, face and beauty products, and numerous tourist trinkets.  But really, it is all the neon and energy and liveliness in the crowds that make this place work.  An hour will do or stay the whole evening; it's totally up to you.  Also, as it is downtown it is walkable from anywhere in the tourist area and certainly a short walk to a bus or metro stop.  Definitely go; one of our highlights.  5 stars.", November 2019

That said, the neighborhood actually is not that big - two main thoroughfares, primarily, each maybe 4-5 blocks long. Lots of side streets with other shops and food options, but the main action really is on the thoroughfares. Lots of cosmetic shops, lots of cheap clothing of the Forever 21 quality level.The street food was very much hit or miss, nothing completely mind blowing. Lots of repeat stands, but note that not all the stands have the same quality. I tried to use the length of the lines for each as a rough gauge on how good the stand may be - also a hit or miss approach.Two tips and heads up (literally):- there are a lot of hidden eateries, cafes, and shops in all the buildings above ground level. really pay attention and look up to see what you may be missing out on! I found a few cafes that I loved - grab a coffee and a window seat and you can people watch all the action down below for awhile- garbage cans are really hard to come by. stay with the vendor you purchase food from and chuck your garbage with them after you're done, or come prepared", October 2019

Busy area with lots of local restaurants, street food and national and international chain stores selling mostly clothing, make up and other fashion products. Be prepared to be walking very slowly as it is likely that the crowds in this area will make it impossible to get anywhere fast. Not my kind of shopping area with all the international stores but a good place to visit anyway.", September 2019
247,3.0,Must see for shoppers....,"Non-shoppers may want to stop by just to see the scene or grab some delicious street food.  Myeong-Dong is super busy from about mid-morning until late at night.  Really, there is something for everyone however, mostly geared toward those interested in shopping.  Skin care products are all the rage and are all over the place here - from high end to bargain buys, there are clothes in all sizes, and more food options than you could imagine.  Street foods (anything on a stick), the sweet and savory egg bread, my personal favorite Delimanjoo (pricy at exit 4 of the metro, they put on a bit of a show too), and higher end restaurants where you can sit for a nice meal.  Go with patience and empty hands (i.e. - don't bring your luggage).  Definitely not a 'local market' experience however, good for some gifts to send home and people watching.", September 2019
248,5.0,Very vibrant at night,"I really like Myeongdong night market. Its so alive and people of all ages come here, so it's not just tourists. Its a great place for street food and souvenir socks which retail at W10,000 for 11.  I'd definitely cone back again.", September 2019

When we went, there was a huge market with food, crafts, souvenirs, cheap knock offs.. it was lively and smelled like good food the entire way.. great Korean scene. Lots of people, mix of tourists and locals. We had your children so it was difficult to get around with a stroller. Definitely would not recommend letting your kids walk around without at least holding your hand. If you're looking for a deal, it may not be the best place. Could find similar but cheaper stuff in Dongdaemun, especially on weekends.", September 2019

255,4.0,Birthday trip,"This was our stop before lunch. This shopping district was very not too crowded and we freely walked from vendors stalls to shops without any rush. Some of us were even braved enough to sample free coffee and teas. We purchased some of our first souvenirs and clothing in this shopping area. Prices were reasonable and you can bargain.  We had limited time and were only able to explore one end of the shopping area before meeting with our guide for lunch. If I go back I would certainly add more time here. Again, impressively clean. I was too busy to remember to take pics.", September 2019

As comparison, fish cake in usual street near hongdae is only krw 1000 but in myeongdong krw 2500, same for all street food, all over price. If you get lost, there is always some person with red clothes who can give you direction to closest exit to subway or assist you to find the shop that you want.

They have grilled seafood like lobster tails. There are also restaurants nearby,  one inside a mall and they are good too. Underground shopping center for souvenirs is great - items are negotiable.

268,4.0,Myeongdong Shopping street,"Myeongdong street is a shopping heaven, both for food, goods, and beauty products. It is clean and not rowdy, making it a safe place to roam around even at night. You have to try the street foods, they taste really yummy and cheaper than eating at a sit-down restaurant. You can have a good fill of delicious food just walking around while shopping. Beauty products are sold at stores left and right. You cannot go wrong as Korean beauty products are top of the line. It would be a mistake to come home without atleast buying one beauty product. As far as buying replicated goods on the street, it is not advisable to haggle down on the price as every vendor sells pretty much similar items in the same price. Don’t embarass yourself as they will just dismiss you or worse, you may end up being laughed at or given the dirty look.", August 2019

273,5.0,I love it and I hate. ,"Unless you visit at 10am between Mon-Thurs expect it to be a mad house. It’s always jam packed with people. As as westerner it has some of the best options for shopping in my opinion as it offers more stores and sizes that I’m familiar with. Also it has all the major local stores if interested in those. The street food is second to none in Korea!
