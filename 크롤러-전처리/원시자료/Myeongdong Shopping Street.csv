0,4.0,Shopping Street,"This area has a lot of skincare and cosmetics products. Price is not really cheap (Ehwa area is cheaper). However you can get everything here. A lot of food vendors too. Halal restaurants also available here. If you want to do a lot of shopping in Seoul, there are a lot of hotels to choose from, walking distance to Myeongdong.", October 2019
1,5.0,My favourite place in seoul,"We always book our stay near the myeongdong shopping street because of the convenience and the endless food and shopping options it offers. You can find all the famous korean cosmetic brands there and the shops and streets are always crowded, especially at night. The street food there is a must try and we highly recommend the spicy fish cake, hotteok( sweet korean pancake), Gimbap for an authentic korean experience.", January 2020
2,4.0,cosmetics and skin care haven!,"Here you can find Korean hype brand, medium to high-quality brand in way cheaper price than in any other country. The restaurants were a bit expensive compare to other areas in Seoul, but this like where first timer tourists should to go to.", December 2019
3,4.0,Great fun,"Go early evening to enjoy the food stalls, & check out the Chicken & Beer bars (that's exactly what they serve!).", March 2020
4,5.0,Shopping Galore,This was a unique shopping experience for the family. There were so many street vendors with just about anything you can think of and lots of food. There are also shops and restaurants in the buildings along the street with more selections than the street vendors so you really need to make a day of it if you have people with you that have the shopping bug., February 2020
