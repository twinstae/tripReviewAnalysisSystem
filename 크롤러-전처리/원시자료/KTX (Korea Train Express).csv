0,4.0,Comfortable ride to our destination,Travelled on KTX to Pyeongchang and the ride is very smooth and comfortable. The KTX App is available in english and it's easy to search and book for your tickets using the app. Book your tickets earlier if you are travelling during the peak season so that you can get a seat., March 2020
1,5.0,fastest way to travel,tried the train from Seoul to Busan around 330 KM where it was around 2 hours and 40 minutes which was really fast and first class cabins was wonderfull it was nice journey, February 2020
2,3.0,Not too bad,"Compare to Japanese train, KTX has room for improvement.  Luggage space is limited, toilet are not clean.", February 2020
3,5.0,Super Fast and Super Cool! Love it.,"We woke up very early in the morning as we were heading towards Busan. Busan is a city that its located, literally on the lowest bottom of the South Korean Peninsula, meaning it will take a multitude of hours to reach through several types of transportation, except for a plane of course. But by taking a plane, one will miss some of the country side views and diverse cities we went through with the KTx Bullet Train Korea.We bought First Class as we wanted piece and quiet and yes, why not? we wished to experience the full comfort that a Super Train that travels at 300 Km per/hour = 187 miles per/hour, has to offer. We actually checked the speed on the Iphone and screen shot it for your convenience to see.We literally did not noticed when the train took off and it was not too long after that we reached the top speed mentioned above. It was like going on a feather, it felt as we were going 50 km per/hour a soft and unforgettable ride, that at that super fast speed took us to the lowest point of the peninsula in 3 to 4 hours only (counting several stops in some mayor cities along the way).They give you a small treat and cookies in First Class. nothing too fancy, but the seats are bigger, wider and you have lots of leg room with a huge table just for yourself.We did love the ride as we mentioned and we do recommend this experience as a Must See and Try when in Seoul and South Korea in general. First Class cost 80 dollars a piece and per trip, therefore making the math, me and my wife we spent some 300+ US$, almost the same price than going by plane minus the long ride to the airport which is costly (80 US$ a pop and per trip) and minus the hassle and security checks of airports and bumpy rides and nasty small seating space.Totally worth!!!!. Enjoy the pictures we shared for you.", January 2020
4,4.0,Perfect way to travel,KTX offer a pleasant travel between many cities in Korea. You can fully trust the time schedule and the ride is smooth. WiFi means you can work or leisure without problem. They donâ€™t sell coffee though., January 2020
