2,5.0,New Year's Eve at Starfield,It was one of the coldest but most memorable new year's eve countdown parties I ever experienced! The food stalls were up as early as noon and people started coming in early. There were plenty of security personnel around so it felt safe and was not hard to move around. The mall was open until 10pm. We had formal dinner before the countdown party. The program began at around 9pm and it was fun as expected with many Korean TV personalities in attendance. The fireworks did not disappoint too!! It was a night to remember!, January 2020
3,2.0,Beautiful Outside - Average Inside.,"I agree with most that the architectural display out side the Starfield COEX Mall is impressive to say the least. But inside? That's another story. Low ceilings, very dole and depressive. We felt as encased for a lack of better words.It does not represent inside the modernistic approach from the outside. The quality of the stores are really average and we believed that a structure of this kind would have design better stores and with better choices. Most things once again, cheap Chinese stuff, disposable value items and again the infantile South Koreans with stores filled with teddy bears (for adult people) cute cartoon printed made in China socks (for adults) and the distribution of the stores....very confusing.Not a well planned mall and nothing to offer except for the Starfield Library, which is really pretty and impressive. Two floors library with lots of colors and places to eat. Basically the only highlight of the Starfield COEX Mall which is pretty average.Except for the Starfield Library which you can access directly from the streets, the rest of the mall is a waste of pure time. Not recommended.", January 2020

Nice place to chill.Locating in a business area, I think it's not specifically designed to attract foreign tourists. But, we have seen many of them.

8,3.0,Just ok,"I was expecting this mall to be bigger for shopping but it's not that big. I didn't visit the aquarium but I did to to the library which was unique and impressive. The shops weren't anything I haven't seen before in Seoul either.

9,4.0,Worth a Visit!,"This is the largest underground shopping mall in Asia and it does not disappoint.  Of all the shopping malls that I‚Äôve been to in Seoul, this one most resembles those in the States.  If shopping weren‚Äôt enough, there is a cinema and conference area.  One of the most unique parts of this mall is the library that sits in the middle.  It‚Äôs a lending library with shelves from floor to ceiling which continue to the floor above.  Just as incredible is the fact that it‚Äôs packed with people sitting around and reading.  Yes, there are people in Korea who go to the mall to read.  Incredible.  Another live-and-learn moment.", November 2019

THIS is the same library! I am sure of it! Perhaps it was the inspiration for this portion of the movie. Come to COEX Mall just to see the library and you will understand what everyone is talking about! I loved seeing entire families sitting there together with books. I was amazed to see children off all ages, sitting in nooks against the window panes, reading. How wonderful of Korea to have inspired so many children to enjoy the simplicity of curling up with a good book. A real, actual book, not a tablet or a computer. A paper book to hold in their hands. I hope more countries will be inspired as well.", September 2018

All the restaurants are packed with hungry lunch goers, you literally have to wait in line for everything. You can't even find a seat at the cafeteria.  It's just that busy.

128,2.0,Didn't like it much! üòï,Ok I wouldn't call it the hidden gem of Seoul . The shops are expensive and I wouldn't have even visited the place if it weren't for a meeting near by.

129,4.0,HUUUUUGE mall with an Aquarium and lots of restaurants,"I am not huge fan of malls, but I had to go check out the COEX Mall. It is really big and you can easily spend a whole day there. There are several options for restaurants - western food too. Between the COEX Mall and the Samseong station is a big hands monument in honor to Gangnam Style song by Psy. It plays the music and you can see the video clip in a screen. Since you are in Gangnam why not take a picture there?

Of course, it is a very touristy spot that can get crowded at times with tourists, haha, but we spent more than 5 hours there! It's so big that my feet hurt from walking at the end of the visit but we were able to see the aquarium (very unique and ~21 USD), do a VR roller coaster ride, play arcade games, shop for 40 mins, eat ramen, check out their architecture, and eat the best green tea ice cream! Shops range from buyable for the average middle class person to luxury brands to souvenir shops to random trinkets! I suggest getting a map! Definitely enjoyed the visit minus the insane amount of obnoxious tourists but definitely fun if you like aquariums, shopping, people watching, arcades, movies, you name it.

Very bright and clean looking throughout.  Many clothing stores.  There is a large good court too.  Also, a movie theatre and aquarium.  Aquarium was very good on the other night.  It closes at 8 pm with ticketing ending at 7.  We got lost trying to find our way back from the aquarium one night, but discovered the food court which had lots of seating and some nice options.  Here we ate bulgogi and noodle soup with galbi short ribs.", October 2016

We found a healthy variety of common western brands and unique local ones, from luxury goods to discount stores that sell cell phone accessories.  Similarly the food options are numerous.  A whole day is barely enough to enjoy all the shops and amenities of this shopping complex.  It's conveniently accessible via subway too!", December 2016
140,5.0,Huge mall with SO much to do!,"It's busy, expensive, and has everything you might ever want at a considerably higher price than you'd likely find in pretty much any other country in Asia, but if you have that European or American ""itch you can't scratch"" this is the place for you.

154,4.0,My Seoul trip,"One of the interesting places to visit in Seoul is the COEX Mall.I would say don't miss it. The best way to get there from the city center, if you are taking the subway, is to take line 3(the orange line). Line 2(green line) will also take there, but line 3 takes less than 25 minutes.Take line 3 to Seoul university station and then take line 2 to Samseong station.Whenever you get out of the train look at the station and vicinity map posted on the platform to see the closest exit to the mall. As you enter the mall, make a right and you will see the information desk and a virtual interactive map of the layout of the mall.Check this out before you start exploring the place. Check the various restaurants and the food court before you decide to eat. Believe me, you wouldn't want to miss out on some of the best food in Seoul, all under one roof. Also check out the various retail shops, just browse, even if you don't buy anything, this would be an interesting experience. Once you are done with the mall, check out the area around the mall. There is always something going on.When I visited in September, there was a free K-pop concert ( Korea Sale Festa) going on near the mall.", September 2016
155,4.0,Touristy,"One doesn't see how big Coex Mall is from street level.  A large part of the mall is underground and it is huge.  Thus, wear comfortable shoes.  Since this is Korea, the mall does have a lot of skin care, make-up and beauty stores.  Many of the shops in Myeongdong are also in Coex.  There are who stores and fashion stores and a lot of restaurants.  There are high end shops but also bargain places like Daiso.  What I wish they had though was bookstores and shops for stationery, pens and art materials.  For a tourist who has to attend a convention in the nearby Coex convention centre, this is a good place to shop.  Also a good place to get gifts to bring home.", September 2016

Inside has a money change bank , lots of food places, subway access. and of course commercial shops. Good to spend half  a day if the weather outside is too extreme. But it is very commercial. Doesn't represent the true culture or Korean style in my opinion. So a couple of hours is the most you should spend here. It is across the street from the temple so it's handy to cool off or refresh after the temple visit.", September 2016

The stores seemed to be closed or without any customers. When I came later, around noon, it was hard to get around as the mall got very crowded. And it was apparent why. Queues were forming in front of all restaurants which aren't in a dedicated food court but scattered all around. Apart from many restaurants and a few stores, the mall is home to several halls where 3 different conventions were being held on the day. In addition, on the second floor you can find hundreds of small businesses.", July 2016

However, there was a large bookstore with a English section, so nice to sit and have a read (until an obnoxious English man with his child decided to read really loud - (no consideration).

177,3.0,Very Confused Layout....Maybe It Was Just Me,"When we visited this mall I kept wondering: maybe it's just because I am an American. We walked and walked and walked and we never found really much of anything. It was very strange. And then we would find ourselves in a giant, empty convention-hall lobby? All malls in Korea are not like this: we found several other malls to be sensibly laid-out and easy to navigate. Not so at the COEX Mall.", July 2016
178,4.0,"Enormous, but could be anywhere on the planet","If I were organizing a world conference with 30,000 participants, this would be a very attractive venue.

Lots of food options and was surprised to see even Indian and Turkish food.But what we liked were that there's a nice aquarium for the kids which we'll have to come back for since we spent most of the time at the kids lounge (Pororo).  Traded off shopping while the kids played.

It's an integrated and connected to many building in the complex which might make us frustrated and  get lost to find the way.

Lots of International Brand exist there.", June 2016

187,4.0,We went for the Gangnam Hands,"Not sure if there's a shorter way, but we had to walk quite a few blocks from the Gangnam Station exit to reach the front of this enormous mall.Unfortunately, we arrived around eleven at night, way past the closing hour of this mall. I would have liked to get inside. Even at the late hour, you could see the interior and how big the place is.We then went to the front  after locating the new art installation for Gangnam Style, and danced like fools under the hands so we could cross off ""Dance to Gangnam Style in Gangnam"" off our bucket list. HAHAHA.Needless to say, we got weird looks from people who looked like they were on their way home, as well as from those who just got off at the bus stop behind the monument. We also probably gave a laugh to the people manning the CCTVs. =))))", May 2016
188,2.0,Worst shopping experience,"Very frustrating the way that it has been built it is quite a mess really. shops are everywhere you get lost and so spaced out , not much shops to buy from eventhough its huge took us so long from myeongdong to gangnam by taxi so much traffic and was a waste of time, not worth the visit", June 2016

193,4.0,A huge mall,"The mall is huge and I enjoyed walking in the mall. However, it was difficult for me to find directions. I felt that it was like a maze.There are a lot of restaurants in the mall and I particularly liked the donkatsu restaurant Saboten a lot. Because the mall is connected to Grand Intercontinental hotel and Hyundai department store, it was convenient to wonder around in all three places without having to go outside.", April 2016
194,3.0,Average mall,No point of interest despite being the second largest mall in asia. Layout is so confusing and and got lost a few times trying to find the food court. Too many international brand that can be found anywhere., May 2016
195,4.0,Asia'a largest underground Mall,"This is the claim it makes, and many agree! Rankings aside, this place is a great place to hang out for high end brands and cosmetics in the Gangnam district (Gangnam-Gu). Took us about 25 mins by cab from city centre (CBD) and about KRW 11,000 to get there. Restaurants are great too, and the metro network has a station in the basement. Great outlets include Butter & Zara Home.", April 2016
196,3.0,Not particularly interesting,"This used to be one of my favourite areas to hang out in. There aren‚Äôt a large number of crowds, and the area is humongous anyway. However, I feel that the way the shops are laid out isn‚Äôt very well-planned. You‚Äôd find an area with food in one corner, walk for another 10 minutes and find another cluster of food stalls at another area. The signage/directions are rather confusing at times and the place is too big, it can be a pain if you are looking for a specific shop and realise you have to walk around 20 minutes just to get to it. The developers could have built more floors instead of having almost 95% of all the shops on the same level. There are a lot of international brands as well, so shopping isn‚Äôt particularly interesting for me. I feel that guidebooks tend to over-rate this place way too much.", April 2016
197,4.0,Not enough signage,"This complex is quite large and you can reach there either from Sports Complex Station or Bongeunsa Station. With many local or international brands, restaurants, casino, duty free shop & hotel, there is not enough signages to ensure you are on the correct way to the destination, so I have to check the digital directories from time to time.", March 2016
198,4.0,Lots of cafes & branded shops,"This mall is huge so u could focus on certains stalls that u are hunting for, or just shop wherever u walk to. Tried the drinks and cake at Sopresso Coffee, which were pretty good", April 2016
199,3.0,Gigantic Mall...,This mall was enormous! Full of expensive shops and a little less expensive shops that you see everywhere else in Seoul. The aquarium was a point of interest but we did not go because it's too much and if I wanted to see fish I'd go diving instead lol. There's a huge K-Pop shop/museum connected to it that was interesting. Our group wanted to see the Kimchi museum but it was no longer in the mall anymore., March 2016
200,2.0,Used to be better before the revamping,"A bunch of international brands and designers with just a few korean ones. Used to be a big mall with loads of korean shops and studio ghibli store. Now it's a big mall with mostly boring shops.. Used to be worth the visit, not anymore. Now it's a great place for locals..", March 2016
201,4.0,Huge mall ,Talk about shopping this complex is huge there are many shops and high-end trendy stores if you are on a tight budget I wouldn't come here because it's really high end restaurants and stores. It's also very large but it's also very confusing I found it very difficult to navigate so if you're willing to spend a lot of money and buy really nice high end clothing and purses and watches this is the place to be it's also very close to the subway station.... near Ïû†Ïã§ too!, March 2016
202,4.0,Huge complex,"Shopping, aquarium, hotel, restaurants, mart all within one complex with connections to Hyundai department store, the CALT building and more, can get lost easily however there are directories everywhere, don't bother going to the customer desk, they can't really speak English.", March 2016
203,2.0,"New, scattershot layout frustrates beyond belief","It's hell to find anything with no rhyme or reason why it's laid out the way it is.  I thought it was confusing before the 2 year renovation but I was soooo wrong.  They label shops by letters and numbers but it makes no sense when they intersect with each other and the arrows/signs are just wrong most of the time.  Spent 20 mins looking for a restaurant in the food court but it's not a traditional courtyard style food court.  It's just restaurants almost along the same row.  It gets even more confusing when you add the Oakwood arcade foodcourt into the mix.The shops aren't really anything special either.  They claim no exclusives in Seoul and everything can be found in Myeongdong, Gangnam or Garosugil.  The only benefit might be when it's poor weather outside since COEX is underground.", March 2016
204,3.0,"Massive mall, but can be passed on","I read that this was one of the largest underground malls in the world and the largest one in Asia I believe, so I had to come here. This place indeed is very big with an assortment of shops (and a random small aquarium as well!), but it's easily passable if you're tourist as there isn't anything really remarkable/memorable about it. They have an alright food court though.", May 2015

207,3.0,Huge mall,"This mall is huge and mostly under ground, but it's basically just a regular shopping mall, only easier to get lost in. Worth visiting if it's raining outside or if you're looking for something specific. Not really an attraction in itself, though.", February 2016
208,4.0,Get lost in Coex Mall,"I'm not usually one for crazy shopping trips while travelling, but we made Coex Mall a destination when we found out about the Gundam Base retail store cuz we're nerdy like that.So big that it has two different KTX stops that bring you to its front doors.It's more of an upscale mall with a great variety of popular Korean and foreign brands (Uniqlo, Roots, and some European designers are all I remember off the top of my head) as well as smaller boutique stores. Also being in a very developed area of Gangnam as well as being a destination in its own right, everything is a little bit more expensive here, especially compared to many of the other underground malls that have more stalls than built-out stores.The food selection has a wide variety of prices and offerings so you'll find something you like for sure. The Seoul Aquarium and a movie theater are also in the mall if you're not much of the shopping type.All in all, covering the whole mall would take about an hour of non-stop walking. While stopping in a few shops here and there, you can get through it in 2-3 hours. If you're like my girlfriend, well, you can spend the whole day here pretty easily. We did this early on in our trip to Korea so it was a nice introduction to Korean mall culture and the local style, I guess.", December 2015
209,4.0,Decent shopping mall,"This mall has many shops out of the ordinary, and is therefore worth a visit. Many wacky stores makes this perhaps the best place to go if you only have one day shopping in Seoul. There is a large selection of restaurants as well with a variety of foods.", April 2015
210,4.0,Biggest underground mall in the world!,"I'm here several time during my visit in Seoul, 2 times for SBS award shows Red Carpet and once for visiting SMtown artrium. There are few Halal restaurants here, but mostly quite pricey, so I decided to eat at Lotteria, lol. Many cool cafes and boutiques and you can check out too. Oh and every end of the year, there is an award show held in COEX convention hall, if u're lucky u can catch a glimpse of their artists walking down the red carpet. Well, I'm lucky enough to see Runningman casts and several Korean actors/actress this year :)", December 2015

212,4.0,this is mall a very huge mall,It is not usual to see people carrying maps when walking in malls. But the sheer size of this mall and you will understand why.The walk spaces are wide but the stores themselves are pretty moderate in size.Both the Grand Continental and Continental Coex are found at both opposites of the mall. There is a casino and Lotte Duty free. Check out the Megabox Cinema. Extremely classy., December 2015

Perfect for a rainy day or blistery weather outside.", November 2015
215,3.0,Come for the food and movies; leave for the real shopping,"Pretty modern indoor mall (connected underground by subway). Lots of a great eats and there's a movie inside that plays the hits of the day. My goal was never to actually shop here but from the looks of it, I'd go elsewhere. Seems overpriced and in certain places, too specialized - or is that the point? There's an aquarium inside too which I was really tempted to go but I'd just eaten a bunch of sushi and didn't need a reminder that I had probably eaten Nemo.", November 2015

220,5.0,Spend the day at COEX before leaving Seoul!,"We took a $12 US cab ride from Insadong to COEX Mall. We walked in and followed the signage to the City Airport Transit. Only travelers on certain airlines may use this service. We were traveling on Korean Airlines, which was one of the associated airlines. We checked in our luggage, got our seating assignment  and boarding passes, then, went upstairs next to the Airport Limo Bus waiting area in a section called ""Arrivals"".  There were lockers to rent for about $3 -$4 US for 6 hours. We stored our hand carry luggage there.  My husband is interested in tea, and lucky for him, there was a huge Tea Exhibit in one of the conference halls. We spent several hours there admiring exquisite displays of tea cups, ceramics and tea pots that were impressive! Some of the artists were there serving tea in their bowls. There was a plethora of teas and everything related to tea. We saw a tea ceremony performance and talked to so many people.  When you're there, check out what conferences and exhibits are held--you may be lucky like us!   We left because I was starving! There were so many restaurants to choose from in the mall. We saw an eyeglass shop and had heard that eyeglasses were reasonable in Korea, so, we checked it out and got some spiffy glasses as our souvenir!  They were professional there, checking our eyes against our prescriptions and I was glad that we went there rather than a shop on the streets.   The mall kept going on and on with an Aquarium, movie theatres, shopping, shopping and more shopping.  We had planned to walk across the street to Bongeusa Temple for tea, but, we were tea'd out after that fabulous Tea Exhibit.    We found our way back to our lockers using the well-marked signage, then, bought the Airport Limo Bus ticket (about $17 US each).  The ride took a little over an hour and dropped us off on the 3rd floor at the airport where we could skip the long lines and go through the City Airport Transit line. Wonderful experience!", October 2015
221,4.0,Huge Mall,Huge mall! It's very easy to get lost so definitely grab a map. It's a pretty standard mall with some fun stores. Check out Butter for kitschy household items and souvenirs. The Hyundai department store is a must see. It's 11 stories and filled with high priced boutique stores. It's fun just for the experience. The mall has a ton of restaurants in and around the food court. They are all fairly quick so you could easily eat here on break from a conference., October 2015
222,4.0,Biggest underground mall in Asia,"I've been here twice and I have to say the first time was better. While it was under construction it seemed like it had SO much potential to be bigger and greater. The second time I visited, after the renovations, it was just a giant regular mall with regular stores. Or maybe I was just tired of Korea by then.", May 2015
223,4.0,Nice shopping xenter,"Coex Mall houses quite a lot of shops. It is connected to the Hyundai Department Store. In the mall is also a casino. Did not check it out so won't be able to comment.

To get there, take the metro to Samseong Station and exit at exit 5 or 6.", October 2015
224,3.0,Average for Shopping except.............,"The mall itself seemed very average to me. Yes, there are a lot of stores, most aren't high end, and most aren't low end, just somewhere in between. The lay out of the mall is very maze like. At times I wasn't sure where I was going. But, somehow the mall connected into the Hyundai Department Store. Since this is located in Gangnam, the first two floors are dedicated to luxury shopping. And I do mean ""high end"". This Hyundai Department Store is the best in Seoul! And they have a food court on the lower level. Is the mall still worth going to..........it sure is. There are lots of other things to do there.

If you venture around to the bottom of the Hyundai department store, there are lots of bakeries selling awesome treats, a shop selling the best Korean mochi treats (dduk) that I have found in Seoul ‚Äì including one with white cake crumbs which tastes like birthday cake that my whole family absolutely loves, a good wine shop and a cool place to find interesting kitchen items from around the world.‚Ä¶¬†so‚Ä¶ if you're looking for a day to wander around aimlessly indoors‚Ä¶¬†a place that will keep everyone in the whole family happy‚Ä¶ yeah‚Ä¶¬†give Coex a wander.Also there usually seems to be some sort of a special event or pop up store event happening here, so you never know what you'll bump into.", June 2015

233,4.0,Extremely Large mall with Aquarium,"Huge mall in Korea. Good for mall goers & those who come to Korea mostly for shopping. When I say huge I'm not kidding, means a lot of walking.

I'm done"" LoL other than that the parts of the mall I did see were good.", August 2015
234,3.0,The only mall I went to in Korea.,It's a big mall. It's very modern. You can find everything and nothing at the same time.  It's way too big.  As a tourist this was not for me.  I think it doesn't showcase the Korean culture.  I don't know.  I'm not a mall person I just came here because I had to see it for myself since it was my first time in Korea and it was on my way back from gangnam.

235,5.0,Just the real feast for the eyes in such city as Seoul !,"So while the others in our group rather circled in the part of the city on the left coast of river Han, we ( my wife and I ) decided to go across the river and visit some interesting sites in, I may say, more modern region of so dense populated metropole, as it is Seoul. To get on the right coast of the river Han, we had taken a subway tram, whose line is not put deep beneath the ground level, that is, we had a ride with so called ""light metro"".We crossed the Dongbu Bridge and in Gangnam-gu region got to the very exciting place, called Coex Mall.That is an underground big shopping mall. There are here many conventions centers, exhibitions halls, many malls with plenty of shops.Then, passing by these attractive shops, we got to the food courts with traditional korean food. Along with such pleasant stores, we found also the couple of movie theatres, COEX Aquarium, a large book store and even one Museum.You can use the Seoul Metro Line 2, to arrive there. Not so far from the Coex Mall is located Samsoeng Complex, that is very worth to be seen.", September 2014
236,3.0,Seoul shopping experience,Complicated layout but in case I really have enough time for shopping while drifting from one shop to another you will find anything you want :), August 2015
237,4.0,Plenty of stores but not much to see,"I liked COEX Mall before the renovation. It was smaller and had more of a vibe. Now it's huge but lacks any imagination. On a weekday it feels empty due to its expansiveness. On weekends, it's better. Unless you're there to watch a movie or visit the aquarium, there isn't much to do but shop and eat. I guess that's fine for most but I for kids, it can be a bit boring.", June 2015
238,4.0,Massive mall but expensive,"The mall is massive. Very close to park hyatt hotel and attached to the station. It has an aquarium, movie theater and a food court. Many brand shops but very expensive in-comparison to other places. Good place to enjoy and rest after a long business meeting.", June 2015
239,4.0,Great place for a rainy day,"Been to this mall countless times before it was renovated and reopened. The mall has been greatly improved, with the addition of more stores, restaurants, etc. which help avoid rainy afternoons outside. For the Kpop fans there is now a store solely for SM Entertainment music.", April 2015

241,4.0,"Part of the job, but it provided alot to my trip","I spent a week working in the Trade Tower in Seoul. I happened to stay in the COEX Intercontinental, and I was shown 'the way' to walk from one to the other through the COEX Mall. The first day I was overwhelmed with the commercialism, but then as the week wore on, the COEX mall became a friend providing warmth, sustinence and entertainment for me as a solo business traveler in a strange land.HOLLYS COFFEE: Can't find it on the map, but it's worth a visit. I have never before had a Dutch Baby at a restaurant (they're a family favorite to make at a shindig) and it was good (not great). The coffee was very good, better to my palate than Star*ucks).I also ate at Kervan one night, sushi for lunch, found some skin products at one store, and found groceries to stash in my hotel room at the Hyundai basement store.The entertainment was watching the very young, very hip K-POP population meandering the mall in massive crowds at all times of day and night.The surrounding area is not bad to walk, and had some nice sculptures. Quite urban, noisy, not really pedestrian-fun, but not unfriendly to walkers either.", April 2015
242,5.0,everything you need,This mall is huge! It was under remodel last year and now they are done. Lots of places to eat and shop and is conveniently off the subway., March 2015
243,2.0,Dull,"I used to visit COEX regularly before the much needed renovation. Often for the Mexican restaurant (now shunted outside the complex), COEX had a charm about it, was always busy and had plenty of great looking young people wandering around. After returning to Korea I was excited to see that it had reopened and I ventured back only to find a sterile, brightly lit, overpriced and not very busy abomination. If you can imagine a sprawling airport duty free shopping experience, without the bargains then you've no need to visit. They killed COEX!", March 2015

247,4.0,"Modern, Clean Shopping Mall","The COEX mall is under the COEX exhibition hall. It also comes with an aquarium but I did not visit that area. The entrance is conveniently located near the Samseong metro exit. Some days they have musicians performing in the mall. A lot of American Branded stores can be found here such as Levis, Nike, Adidas etc. The prices are a little higher than US MSRP, so if you're looking for a deal, this is not the best place to get it.", February 2015
248,3.0,Don't go if your vacation is short here,"Overrated. Overpriced. Lots of nice, but a bit pricey, restaurants. Aquarium was ok for kids but a bit boring for me as an adult. On place that was cool had bobble head making computer,  but you had to wait 7 days to get the finished product, which sucks if you don't have time. I wouldn't go back.", February 2015
249,4.0,Cool mall,"Came here opening weekend.  If you're American, this place will be most familiar to you.  There's an aquarium, which I didn't enter, but seemed to be really popular.  Lots of local designers and food options.  My mom even got her hair done at a salon here.  It's definitely worth visiting if you have an afternoon free in SK.", November 2014
250,3.0,A Shopping Mall,I'm never sure how to review something like this. It is a mall. There are a lot of shops selling a lot of things you can buy in a lot of other places. I don't know why I'd buy these things in this location. The best feature of the mall are the bevy of restaurants that it has., February 2015
251,2.0,Nothing much,"Sells branded stuff , things are really expensive. Not many shops too. I won't had gone there if I knew it was like this! Waste of time!", February 2015
252,2.0,There are better places to shop out there.,"Part of the mall is still under renovation, hence there isn't much to shop here. No doubt it is huge, very spacious, but wait till it is fully renovated. Most brands in this mall can be found at other huge shopping malls or departmental stores.", January 2015
253,3.0,An incomplete underground shopping mall.,"The mall is located near the Samseong Metro station.This mall failed to impress us for numerous reasons.First of all, it's completely underground and feels totally claustrophobic.Secondly, it's incomplete and large parts of it are still being built.But most importantly - we visited the mall during the summer and parts of it (especially the parts still being built and renovated) were not air-conditioned. This resulted in unbearable temperatures inside the mall and the lack of ventilation plus the mass of people there made the entire experience uncomfortable, to say the least.While there are a lot of eateries around the malls, an aquarium, many shops, cinemas and pharmacies, we still could not escape but feel its gloomy atmosphere.", July 2014
254,3.0,Nothing to see.,We came when the Coex Mall was still undergoing renovation.Nothing to see except the Aquarium which was really expensive and looks small. So we did not go., October 2014
255,4.0,Good Selection of Shops,"I was just here a week ago and while they're still finishing up some construction, most of the shops have moved in. There's a food court with lots of different food, a wide variety of big brands (Versace, AJ, Kiehls, etc) along with some local korean stores (mostly along the corridor to the food court). There is also an A Land + Art Box. What I liked most about this mall was that it was right underneath the Grand Intercontinental Parnas, and it's easy to just go down and grab a bite to eat. I believe the Oakwood and Intercontinental Coex is attached to it as well. The Coex also connects to the Parnas Mall which mostly a few restaurants and like 4 stores. It also connects to the Samsung subway station and the Hyundai Department store. There is a movie theater + Coex Aquarium located inside.", December 2014
256,3.0,Visited days after the opening in Nov 2014,"I was there at the end of Nov, days after their official opening date of Nov 27th. The mall is huge and it was pretty decent. There are still lot of store spaces to be filled and lot of restaurants to be open by early December, per signs at the doors. The Hyundai department store is worth to check out, mostly their food section in the basement. I think it's a good place to do shopping and eat. I didn't go to the aquarium or the movie theater so I don't know if they are worth the visit.", December 2014
257,2.0,Nothing much to see,"Went in 3 times at around 8pm in evening and all 3 times found the mall to be in a closed type of condition - No people, most shops closed and hardly anything to see.", November 2014
258,4.0,Finally Re-opened and always treats to be found,"For the past two years the COEX Mall has been either closed or partly opened. It's handy for those on business who don't have time to visit some of the more diverse shopping areas. There's about 3/4 souvenir shops plus a range of other specialty shops. While many of the shops were the same as in its previous layout, a few new outlets are there and there's a good range of restaurants/cafes. The drawbacks are it's not cheap and some of the owners/staff are somewhat rude - forget the sports shoe shop! If they want to be rude to foreigners make sure they can't speak Korean. But overall a great mall that I'm sure will gather momental as the official opening occurs in early December.", November 2014
259,4.0,Huge Underground Mall.,"This mall includes numerous shops, four food courts ( mostly Korean food ), the excellent, high end Hyundai Department Store, a multiplex cinema, exhibition halls  and an aquarium.

260,4.0,Under construction.,"I had a convention on COEX and I had little chance to visit the mall. Before I came to Seoul I heard that COEX mall is one the famous indoor shopping mall. But when I visited there, they were having renovation. Most of the shops were closed. Hmmm... But still you can find some shops opened. It would be very convenient if the weather is bad. But it's worth vising for those of you who have conference or business in COEX but if not, I recommend you to visit Garosu-gil instead.", September 2014
261,4.0,Convenient mall with lots to do,"Coex mall is attached to the convention center and to the subway.  It's huge, has great food options, an aquarium and a movie theatre.

266,4.0,A popular spot for young people.,"I went to the COEX Mall last Sunday. It is conveniently located above Samseong MRT station. Part of the mall was undergoing renovations but there were still many shops open. There is a good variety of restaurants there- Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Italian, Western, etc. I saw many people in their twenties (mostly young couples) at COEX so if you are a young person you will probably enjoy the atmosphere there.", August 2014
267,3.0,Very large,"It is a very large and imposing underground shopping mall that shares the same facility as an exhibition hall. There were many shopsfront but many were closed, not opened or boarded up. The other mainly sold more of skincare brands and some accessories. I was looking for clothes/ fashion outlets but there were not much at the point in time.It is rather disappointing, and the price here was not too good either. As least not when comparing to Myeodeong or the Women's University. A pity as well, since this place is huge and rather new and clean, so it would have made for a good shopping paradise.For more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/kaptivating-korea.html", November 2013
268,5.0,To the foreigners: please read my review,"Hello everyone,I always use this application, when I go abroad,so I guess you'll see my review, before you come to Samgsung road.Actually I'm Korean, and I live in the Samsung road(10 minutes by walk from COEX.)My grade for Coex is 5stars, because there are many wonderful restaurants, and shops, and etc.But not now.From 2013, Coex mall is on a remodelling, so if you come here, you can use just 2 services.First one is a mega box theater, and 2nd one is a aquarium.I think, It's a terrible season for you to come here.For me, I live in here so I go there to see a moive, but you don't have to see the movie here in Korea. Instead of Coex mall,I recommand you some sites.1st one is Í≤ΩÎ≥µÍ∂Å., which is a royal palace of CHOSUN dynasty. You can see the Korean traditonal structures, and traditional clothes of royal family.2nd is Insa-dong, where you can drink Korean-tea, and see the gallery.3rd one is ÎèôÎåÄÎ¨∏ ÏãúÏû•, which is an cheap market for clothes, and sports equipments.4th is  Î™ÖÎèô, the downtown of Seoul.You can see the cathedral, and korean traditional market, and may complex marts.I think, You can shop here, instead of Coex.5th is  Ïù¥ÌÉúÏõê, this is a road for foreigners. You can go by the subway line no.6, so It's very easy to find it.There are may restaurants of western foods, and pub& clubs are  in Ïù¥ÌÉúÏõê. So I reccomend you to go there in the night.Next is ÏÇºÏ≤≠Îèô.It's a little bit expensive, but there are may beautiful cafes, and delicious Korean restuarants.My last reccomendation is Ïó¨ÏùòÎèÑ.It's a little island, in the Han-river, and in Ïó¨ÏùòÎèÑ, there is a nice river side park.You can jog along the river.(Beer & Chicken will be a perfect selection. You can odrer by phone at the park.)And for the restuarant,I'll say just one thing.Please stop by the  ÌåîÏÉâÏÇºÍ≤πÏÇ¥, in Ïã†Ï¥å(sinchon).It's very popular Korean pork bbq restuarant, and so many Japanese love this restaurant.I believe that you'll be satisfied.That's all.I post this review,just because I see so many foriegners in the Coex these days,and everyone was dissapointed.So I can tell you, not to come Coex, until 2014.(The remodelling""ll be finished on 2014.)Thank you.", January 2014
269,1.0,It is CLOSED!!!,"Or it might as well be closed.  There are miles (kilometers) of boarded-up shops.  Signs everywhere stating that the mall is being refurbished, sorry for any inconvenience...Only a few restaurants are open, the movie theater is open, and I think the aquarium is open.  All else is just boarded-up, empty hallways that seem to stretch to infinity.  And then when you get to the end of an empty hallway, you turn the corner to see...another empty hallway.Not sure how long this refurbishment is going to take, but I would not suggest anybody visit Coex mall in 2014.  It seems to be a huge construction site, not something that will be finished in a few months...The picture (attached to this review) is about the most exciting thing you will see at Coex mall, right now...", December 2013

Unfortunately, it was not as we expected, it was faaaaarrr from our expectations. Only few stores and restaurants were open, the Coex Aquarium, Megabox Cinema, and Lotte Duty Free. That's it! We walked for like 2,4km back and forth to find a practically EMPTY mall. On our way back to the subway station there were a big banner that we missed before, it said ""WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE INCONVENIENT, WE ARE CLOSED DUE TO RENOVATION. WE WILL BE RE-OPEN ON NOVEMBER 2014"". And we were rolling on the floor laughing for our ""unfortunate event"" =))", November 2013
271,3.0,"Here for Marche, world's no.1 buffet","Very huge mall with many shopping as well. But we didn't shop much as most are retail and departmental stores. They're better shopping areas like hongdae, ewha uni etc. We came to COEX mall for Marche, as it's world's no.1 marche which serves buffet! One pax for 23000W, what a good deal! And it's near Lotte World as well. I would recommend coming here if you're heading to Lotte World to have the marche buffet, if not probably not worth coming to the end of Jamsil Station.

It is a fantastic place with TONS of shopping and things to do.  It has a mediocre arcade, a nice aquarium, a great movie theater, a hotel, a convention center, and countless other things to do.  The place is so big, I got lost the first couple times I went there.  I was wandering around and would suddenly find myself in a hotel or something.  The subway leads directly to the mall (literally, you walk out of the station, you're in the mall), just get off at Samseong station.  Best if you bring a friend who is familiar with the place.", November 2012
274,1.0,Being refurbished...avoid until completion!!,"Decidied to take advantage of a rainy day by visiting the Coex Mall for a spot of shop and drop retail therapy. It wasn't until I arrived on Subway line 2 Coex Mall (World Trade Centre) stop and wandered through the maze of boarded gangways that I became aware it was under refurbishment and only a handful of shops were open, alongside the Mega Box Cinema, a few restaurants, and the slightly fishy smelling Aquarium that initially had me thinking the loo's needed a good cleaning...you can imagine my disapointment as I navagated myself back through the maze of boarded gangways looking for the light of freedom empty handed wishing I hadn't bothered to visit.With this in mind, my advice would be to avoid until refurbishment is complete....when this will be is anyones guess!!", September 2013

As you enter into the mall from Samsung Station, (the far right door, that is next to Marche restaurant), keep walking down the main street till you see a information desk that is kind of right before the escalators.You can borrow strollers (I think this service requrs your ID card) from there.Trust me...this will really help you to enjoy the place pleasantly with your little ones.", May 2013

At the other end of the block, after a lot of walking (I was on my own DIY adventure with the map so I was looking like a lost little person), I found the Bongeunsa Temple on the other side of the street.
