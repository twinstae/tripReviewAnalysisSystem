0,5.0,A Seoul Highlight,This was my favourite thing in Seoul. Going here was a truly unique experience. Exquisite grounds and furniture and great guides. , December 2019
1,5.0,Fantastic tour with great furniture and traditional architecture,"The furniture collection is decent and you get to know quite a few things about aristocratic life in the Joseon era. The highlight for me were the fantastically restored buildings themselves, we felt very privileged to see such beautiful surroundings, especially in such an intimate tour group of overall 5 people! Where the museum really stood out: Because we booked rather last minute they only had the Korean language tour left, which we accepted just to see the place. However, they actually arranged for an English-speaking guide last minute to accommodate us, which is more than we could ask for. Only downside: You can't take photos except for one outside briefly with a limited view.", November 2019
2,5.0,Wonderful,Such a delightful visit. You must reserve in advance. Worth finding. Peaceful beautiful with excellent relaxed and informative tour. The view and going inside the buildings are brilliant, April 2019
3,5.0,Exclusive and Unique,"We attended the English tour, with a baby....that was a mistake. Really should be adults only. Beautiful views of the city and a nice intro into how the privileged used to live. Well worth doing.", February 2019
4,5.0,Traditional Korean wooden furniture and architecture.,"If you are in South Korea you might have noticed that this is a country that really knows how to preserve the past on the streets of Seoul city. The Korea furniture museum is no exception even though this attraction is a little bit far from the metropolitan area of Seoul. Here you are going to make it not just to learn about the history and different uses that items of furniture used to have in the old times but also, you are going to feel how you can travel to the past by looking at the wonderful Korean architecture style in their houses and gardens. Every detail in the gardens and the inner part of the houses has been meticulously placed to make the guests feel the harmony and balance between nature and Korean architecture. After living in South Korea for three years I never heard about this place before and none of my Korean friends talked to me about it. I'm going to dare to say that this is is a hidden jewel in Seoul. The guide has really good English skills and everything he said was didactic at all time. I think that despite the long distance from the metropolitan area of Seoul to the Museum this is a must visit if you appreciate the Korean architecture style, and remember, that you must do an online reservation in advance to visit the museum.", October 2018
5,3.0,"Unique, exquisite space/collection, let down by lacklustre tour","The space and the collection are absolutely exquisite, are presented immaculately and free from distractions. It was truly one of the best things I've seen, not only in Korea, but all of Asia on our month long trip. I'm glad to have seen it. 5/5The tour (which is the only way to experience the museum) suffered from many issues. To her credit, our guide's English was fine. Unfortunately, at an hour, the pacing was at break-neck speed, with perhaps 1-2 minutes per display through the main collection. The guides delivery felt impersonal and robotic. No sooner had we sat down, then we were on our feet again moving to the next space. Time was spent dropping names and brands when cultural context and interesting features were glossed over (e.g. the traditional moss garden, something entirely unheard of to my western ears, was mentioned only in passing in pointing out what the G20 first wives were looking out onto during their lunch here).With no photography allowed inside, such short dwell time, and no question time or literature available about the collection, it feels like there are wonders in this museum which no visitor will ever discover, which is a tragedy not only for the museum and the visitors, but for Korean culture.The space and the collection are already world class. With more consideration, a slower pace and genuine interaction and hospitality, a tour which would do it justice is possible. Unfortunately, this is not what you should expect for now.", October 2018
6,5.0,More than furniture!!!,"This private museum, only accessible by appointment, has been a real discovery for me, a hidden treasure. It is a set of palatial houses recovered from various sites in Korea, which make up an architectural ensemble of great beauty. Inside there is a series of furniture from different periods, uses and woods. The person who leads the guide in English is really didactic and friendly. In summary, essential visit despite its distance from the center of Seoul and the absence of public transport to get there, except taxi of course.", September 2018
7,4.0,Private museum showcasing traditional Korean wooden furniture.,"A visit to this private museum must be arranged up to three days in advance via the online reservation system on their website, this way I secured the day and time that best suited our itinerary.  The museum is located on a hill not easily connected by public transport, most visitors we saw came by private car.  We chose to arrive and depart on foot which was the hardest thing about the afternoon.  If you choose to walk like us take the main road from Hansung University Subway station, allow forty five minutes.Once we arrived at the museum's entrance gate we were taken to a small guest lounge to wait until our guide arrived and make the payment for the tour: cash and card is accepted.  There are toilet facilities but no souvenir/snacks/drinks shop.Our guide explains to us that no photography is allowed except in the 'Photo zone'; designated areas outside the building.  Over the next hour our guide is very informative describing the owners, the history of these gorgeous designed buildings, garden design and shown the views from the garden terrace.  Then we are taken inside the buildings and shown around many rooms to get an appreciation of traditional Korean lifestyle.  We are lead downstairs to furniture museum where the collection is described to us: construction materials, purpose and age. For the later part of the tour we are taken into a private room where we take off our shoes and sit on the floor and admire the beauty inside and the views out.  The building and wooden furniture were beautiful to discover, but I feel that the entrance fee of 20000 won was expensive for an one hour tour.", April 2018
8,4.0,much more than furniture,"Don’t let the name mislead you. What this really is, is a museum of traditional Korean culture. There are stories to go with each piece of furniture and each room of the carefully reconstructed and rebuilt historic houses. A fascinating place to see how Korea envisions its traditional past — and a peaceful place to dwell for a couple of hours.", March 2018
9,5.0,Unique ,"Definitely one of the best attractions in Seoul so far. This private museum, despite its unassuming name, is surprisingly stunning and awesome. Perhaps the best-kept secret spot in the city. I’ve spent more than 1 month traveling around all the Korea peninsula and this is for sure one of her most impressive and interesting experience.", August 2017
10,5.0,"a beautiful, peaceful place","I've been there with my korean mum. It was the first time for her too and she lives in Seoul for 40 years ! The guided tour in English was very informative and the place is full of harmony and beauty, a balcony over the city. Wifes at the last G7 meeting in Seoul had lunch there. My Mum told me the price was very expensive, I can' t remember the price as we have been there three years ago.", May 2017
11,5.0,Hidden gem,"A beautiful private museum when you can see how Korean noble families lived in the olden days. The director of the museum has constructed traditional hanok with original room settings, complete with furniture from the era. The result is quite breathtaking and rich in history. It taught me a lot about Joseon dynasty. The English guide tour is interesting and 1 hour flew really quickly. I wish I could stay longer. Those who plan to get here by public transport, try to take the subway to Hansung University station then catch a taxi from there. It will only take approx 5-10mins taxi ride and saves you the trouble of trying to locate the museum in the middle of hilly residential area.", April 2017
12,5.0,A small piece of Korea's history ,I went with a group for a cultural tour and was quite impressed. The guided tour was quite informative and interesting. Be sure to make a reservation in advance., April 2017
13,5.0,Unforgettable experience,"This is definitely a hidden gem as the location is not accessible via public transport. The best way to get there is via taxi from the nearest train station. Prebooking of a tour is essential as it is only open for guided visit. If you love Korean architecture, you will surely be in for a treat. Not only are furniture pieces stunning but the architecture of the building and the landscape around the building are truly breathtaking. Awesome for history buffs too as the tour will give you a glimpse into the past.", November 2016
14,5.0,Fantastic Collection that gives insight into Korean culture,This private museum in the hills above Seoul is a gem!!  You can only visit by making reservations in advance but highly worth it. They have brought houses from across korea to this location and have a collection of over 2000 furniture pieces with about 500 on display.  it is wonderfully arranged and the guides are excellent.  You learn more about Korean culture with a visit here than just about anywhere!  If you have time--and interest in learning more about Korean culture then you must visit., November 2016
15,5.0,Hidden gem,"Stunning examples of traditional Korean architecture in a truly lovely setting. The grounds are peaceful and I felt like I was transported to another era. The furniture collection itself is quite small, though still interesting and indicative of traditional Korean life. It's not the easiest to get to, but is well worth a visit for history lovers (Gilsangsa temple is also nearby).", April 2016
16,4.0,Great place to learn about Korea's History and culture,My Korean flight brought me there as it was the place that the First Lady of China visited when Xi JinPing visited Korea. The place is amazing because i never knew furniture could be so interesting.  Our English guide spoke perfect Engllsh and told stories of ancient Korea through furniture and the way of life.  The setting is beautiful and the korean style ancient architecture is so simple and beautiful.   Even my Korean friend said he learnt a lot from the guide.  It is definitely worth a visit., April 2015
17,3.0,It has potential,"This museum has potential but I felt like I wanted more. The collection of ancient furniture was surprisingly small; our guide mentioned that most furniture were destroyed when their owner died which would have been a reason why the collection wasn't large. However, the collection itself was beautiful and the guide gave detailed history of what the different furniture were for, how they differ from each period, the symbolic way a furniture was made, etc. I also enjoyed the rooms of the 'lord and lady' of the house; as it gives us a chance to see how furniture were made with the human functionality in a room in mind.The location of the museum, while in itself was at a beautiful location (up a hill away from the bustling city. It was quite difficult to get to without a taxi.Overall I enjoyed it but I believe that the museum has the potential to become something more. At this stage, as another reviewer stated- this is a one-time visit.", November 2014
18,3.0,Nice,Interesting grounds with beautiful scenery. Lots of history to read about inside too. It's just a one-time visit though., August 2014
19,5.0,Absolutely wonderful,"Don't be put off by the museum's name. This museum is a glimpse into the social history of Korea, based on the material culture of the people who lived there. We had to book a few days ahead for the English-speaking tour. Our guide was exceptional - she clearly knew the collection very well and her passion came through in a calm and quiet way, much like the museum itself. One of the highlights of our visit to Seoul.Make the most of your trip up the hill and visit the temple down the hill from this museum before you come.", July 2014
20,5.0,A real gem,"The name ""Furniture Museum"" is misleading as it is much more than that. I learnt about the history, architecture and culture of Korea.  Although I was the only one who signed up for the tour that afternoon, they still conducted the tour. The docent showed me around the various buildings and explained the different types of wood used for the furniture in the buildings. She also explained what the different pieces of furniture were used for. It was truly a great learning experience.Thoroughly enjoyed myself.", April 2014
21,5.0,It was very nice,"I set up a reservation for an English tour a few days in advance, not all that staff spoke English but someone called me back who did.  The tour started right on time and we walked around the outside of the facility first.  This in not like the Korean palaces where you have a brochure and walk yourself around, the tour guide told us what she wanted us to know and then answered any questions we had.  She then took us inside and showed us lots of antique handcrafted furniture.  It sounds boring, but its not.", May 2014
22,5.0,Hidden gem; one of the top 3 in Seoul,"Entrance is ONLY by prior reservation. $20 entry fee is well worth what you see in this unique ""hanuk"".  The flawless English-speaking guide is well versed in the history of the royal dynasty and explains and answers all questions with ease.  The name ""Furniture Museum"" is misleading as this is much more than just furniture display.  If possible, ask for advance ""high tea"" catered at 3pm after the 2pm hour long guided tour.  Catered by a French bakery.  Photography inside is not permitted.", April 2014
23,5.0,Korean Architecture,"The title of the museum puzzled me at first, as I was thinking 'Korean furniture'?!?But aside the collection of wooden korean furniture that's very nice indeed and well explained by a lovely guide with perfect English, it is actually the architecture of the whole place that is inspiring and worthing the visit. The founder of this museum lives there.If you're looking for a pause in the time and space, then I recommend this charming detour.Ticket fee is $20 for 1 hour visit. At least 30' from downtown by taxi", September 2013
24,5.0,One of My Top 3 in Seoul,"My top 3 are this, Bonguensa, and Gyeongbokgung Palace, but I like old stuff. I really couldn't decide which I liked best. This museum is quiet and polite. Be prepared to take off your shoes and quietly sit on mats, but the buildings, furniture and views are stunning. Our guide for the english tour was gracious, knowledgeable and friendly. RESERVATIONS are required. It's a bit hard to find, but that's part of the adventure. I road my bike to get there (killer hills), and asked directions several times practicing my pathetic korean. The farther away from the tourist district you get the friendlier people are. I,ve got to say korean policemen are awesome, friendly, helpful and ubiquitous.", September 2013
25,5.0,A Tour into the Past,"Seoul has many lovely districts that are beyond the entrance of the average tourist.  The Korea Furniture Museum provides a glimpse into a world of luxury and also historical past.  There are English tours available at some hours of the day that explained not only the display of furniture collected from Korea's history, but also details of life in another era.  This tour was a gem both in the knowledge of our docent, and the literal glimpses of the Seoul skyline provided through the trees.  Highly recommended.", September 2013
26,5.0,Real Gem,"If you have the time, do book a private guided tour to this museum.  I was fortunate to catch an English tour, which gave excellent commentary about traditional Korean architecture and design of its houses and furniture.  Every piece of house and furniture you will see is a precious part of Korean history, painstakingly and lovingly collected and re-assembled/ presented in authentic fashion by the museum's director.  After an enjoyable hour or so, you will leave this place with a deeper understanding of the culture & ethos of the Korean people.  For now, browse through the museum's website to get a feel of the tranquility you will find there.", April 2013
