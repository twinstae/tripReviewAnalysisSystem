However, I stopped going when it got popular with the tourists as it gets too crowded and the shops are not as unique as it used to be. The best years of my life shopping at Ehwa was the late 90's to early 2000's. I recently visited since my cousin attends school there and got to see how different it looks now. I guess times have changed and I moved on...", April 2016

177,4.0,What the fuss is all about,"Ehwa University is not too far away from Hongik University and they are served respectively by their own metro stations.  Whilst Hongik is grungy and organic, Ehwa has a feel of stateliness about it.  On top of the mound is the longstanding campus that's built by foreigners and it still proudly stands to these days, giving it a sense of tradition and history.  In actual fact, Ehwa University is one of the most elite female university in South Korea.  I truly wouldn't know how students there can concentrate in their studies noting that there are throngs of tourists that are taking selfies and wandering aimlessly around the campus the whole time.  The key part of this University will be the Red Sea parting looking architecture designed by Dominic Perault.  From afar, you look as if you are climbing the stairs that are flanked on both sides by rising waves.  When you get closer, you start noticing that the rising waves happened to be window opening of university campus that's built in accordance with the gradient of the mount.  It's cleverly done.  Naturally, where there are tourists, there would be shops selling duty free stuff, cafes and restaurants and there are oodles of them nearby.  Worth coming here for a look.", January 2017
178,4.0,More than a common university in the city,"People talking Ewha in Seoul, it equates with a designated elite class of young ladies in S.

Outsiders are not allowed going into the campus area, and just allowed to visit glance around the front park, buildings and a cafe at the reception park. But you might already be influenced by the ambience and surroundings, and pushed to take lots of photos. There are more than 30+ cafe just sitting outside the entrance of the university, and with several streets crowed with street hawkers. A good place to go in Seoul.", December 2016

181,4.0,Ewha Womans University,"In the three---month summer holiday, I take a visit to Seoul. And I also want to know more about the culture and study of different countries.

Actually, subway system is quite convenient for us to use. The surrounding of the university is also a commercial circle, like food stores, fashion shops and so on. I go shopping around the university with my friends firstly. The clothes are reasonable and fashion. You have a lot of choices. Then, we enter the university. The campus is really quite large.
