0,5.0,More fun than in working amusement park,"Finally amusement park without lines and sugar rushed kids who yell and run around - we totally enjoyed the place and had way more fun than we would have in normal amusement park! We were only visitors there at the time. Easily you can spend hours there so book some time. There's also little ""cafeteria"" where you can buy drinks and popsicles.", July 2019
1,4.0,Interesting abandoned amusement park,"This amusement park graveyard is kind of creepy and sad but good for photos, films or drawing. It stopped operation in 2011 and since that everything just gets more rusty. For some reason it is not maintained well so year by year things get broken. I wouldn't recommend it for small children. You can get nice photos and I don't think there are many this kind of places left. Park was built around 1980 and there is still that 1980's feeling.", July 2019
2,5.0,So cool for photos!,"This is a great and quirky little break away from the hustle and bustle of the city and perfect for unique photographs. The amusement park has no limits or boundaries so it's easy to get lost in exploring. A very cold spot on winter however as it's so high up so be sure to bring some hot packs! I found this spot in a music video of one of my favourite K-pop groups and decided to look into it more. Trains and subway transfers will get you to Yongma easily and from the station a taxi would only take about ten minutes, however it easily walked to as well.", December 2018
