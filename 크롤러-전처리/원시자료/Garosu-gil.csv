3,2.0,Not worth the hype,"Yes this is a fancy area, where locals shop, but sales assistants are just rude or don't offer you any service.

4,4.0,Hip area,"Garuso-gil is a hip area frequented by locals. Lots of restaurants, cafes and shops. But the usual franchises or big chains of food and fashion but very boutique style, quite unique in its style. This is not your typical tourist spot but a genuine place where locals go to shop and socialize. It has a nice vibe to it and great to stroll through in afternoon and evening.

15,2.0,Only good for restaurants...,"This place is only good for restaurant options. The hype for the brand name that I do not even know of is not worth it. Also, it is disappointing that certain stores do not even let you try on shirts and you can not return or exchange it. Not a good spot for shopping in my opinion.", August 2018
16,2.0,Used to be much better...,"This area used to be a trendy area with a lot of nice cafes, restaurants, and boutique shops. However, in the recent years has seen a huge number of big brands coming in and made the whole area a.... meh... not interesting any more.", August 2018

19,5.0,Better than Myeongdong,"I went to both Garosu-gil and Myeongdong shopping streets and I have to give Garosu-gil 2 thumbs up! As a cafe / coffee lover, I recommend exploring this place! You will find unique and hipster coffee houses as well as the usual coffee houses (such as Line Cafe) you will commonly find in Korea. Moreover, you see people wear really trendy and fashionable clothes here than in Myeongdong. Another bonus point is there are quite a number of insta-photo spots where you can take nice photos :)", June 2018
20,4.0,Gingko Tree Lined Street,"I visited the Bohemian-chic Garosu-Gil Street in my day tour. It is an upscale and trendy shopping and art district located south of the Han River in Sinsa-dong, Gangnam-gu. We had limited time for roaming around.  Garosu-gil, also known as ""Gingko Tree Lined Street"". The vibs are very youthful and hippy. SEE photos", June 2018
21,5.0,Great street for cafe and shopping!,This street is lined with fashion stores and cafes and youthful crowds. It's better than the many malls in Seoul as it offers good diversity and nothing beats outdoor shopping!, June 2018
22,3.0,Boring street,"Although there are lots of people here, but for some reason, I don’t feel any excitement here. Lots of cafeteria and some restaurants selling non Korean food. No street food. If you are looking for food, you might have better luck with the next parallel street to this one.", June 2018

26,5.0,Must-visit for all fashionista,"You need to dedicate your entire afternoon at garosugil. Over here they have unique clothing boutique that shouts 'korean-style'. And of course its selling at a higher price as the design you can't find it at places like hongdae, edae or myeongdong. Judging from the quality it definitely worth the price. My advice is don't focus only on shops located along the main street. There are many more hidden gems inside those narrow alley. If you are tired there are plenty of cafes for you to choose. Have a sip of coffee and enjoy people-watching, or you can chit-chat with friends. Also, there are a lot of instaworthy corners for you to explore. Don't be shy because they are many people posing for photos too. I hope you guys will enjoy garosugil as much as I do.", January 2018

28,4.0,Garosugil Glam,"This is one place that draws me more than Myeongdong for its more glitzy image and less congested street. Although the shops here are more upmarket, this street sprouts into narrower alleyways that lead you to myriads of cafes that offer a tantalising array of cakes and lattes. Four years ago i had stumbled upon this tiny but quaint cafe called the Banana cafe which serves cakes in a flowerpot and lattes topped with pink cotton candy. If you love skin care then you must visit the Skin Food Cafe after shopping for its products and the Dr Jart flagship store that flaunts its state-of-the-art deco to lure you to buy its array of products that promise to transform your face into a flawless complexion. That i can vouch for after I bought it’s line of Ceremide masks that uses nano technology!", November 2017
29,4.0,Shopping paradise,"A more unique and refined shopping experience in Seoul with its gingko tree lined avenue compared to the cosmetic street in Myeondong or the bargain basement sweep in Dongdaemun.Be warned that it may be expensive. Fun place to people watch, window shop or to have a cup of coffee", November 2017

45,5.0,great shopping,anything and everything can be bought here. If you are looking for Korean cosmetics - you will find it here, September 2016
46,5.0,Great street to chill,"Went here twice during our stay in Seoul. The main street is great, but the really nice and chic cafes are in the little streets branching out from the main street, so a little bit of exploration is advised.We found really good places like C27, Acacia, Gilbert's Burgers and Fries, FIKA from these smaller streets and they're worth checking out.", July 2017

48,5.0,Neighborhood much larger than Dosan-Daero 13-gil!!,"We stayed in this neighborhood as a base for exploring the rest of Seoul. Advantages are that there are numerous small streets on either side of Dosan-Daero 13-gil to explore filled with boutique cafes, restaurants, bars, karaoke, and shops. Although Dosan-Daero 13-gil has lots of western name brand stores, the streets to either side seem to mostly have one-offs that are currently under-represented on trip advisor. There are very few western tourists on these side streets but it seems very popular with local 20- and 30-somethings. Restaurants range across Korean, Japanese, French, Italian, Mexican, Indian, Thai, Vietnamese. Especially enjoyable for walking around in the early evenings when it is cooler and the shops are still open (generally until 9 or 10pm). A little harder to find restaurants for breakfast before 10am, though there are some. Arrive using the Sinsa metro station, take exit 8, and then turn down any of the streets to the left to access the area.", June 2017
49,5.0,Worth going,"10mins walk from MRT station. I personally quite like the environment. Very nice street with mixture of boutiques, cafes and restaurants. I went there twice during the trip.", June 2017
50,5.0,The Rodeo Drive of Korea,"Garosu-gil is located in the Gangnam area of Seoul. This is the more affluent part of the city, with BMW's and designer brands as commonplace as coffee shops. The best part about this place is that it's so scenic. Even if you have no major cash to spend on the big stores and brands, you can have a good time walking by the sidewalk and enjoying the trees swaying in the breeze. There are also lots of great places to eat here, which cater to all cuisines and tastes. (Try finding the Flying Pan and Saigon Market, which are really great places to try.) Don't be afraid to go into side alleys either, because we were able to try some delicious desserts at one of the cafes on their roof deck. Also checkout Artbox, which is a great place to buy affordable/quality souvenirs! I was annoyed I didn't find this sooner. Garosu-gil isn't the shopping mecca for millennials or frugal folks, but it's still worth visiting for the sights and sounds!", June 2017
51,3.0,Very good but need more restrooms. ,"It very good to feel the gangnam style. It was very good when I first visit here at that time I didn't feel any inconvenience but today (9 June, 2017) I am waiting for customers. There is no ""Open Restrooms"" in this street. (In South Korea, we have many oppen restroom for visitors.) So I have buy drinks or coffee to go to restroom or I have to far to subway station.  It is very uncommen in South Korea that don't have  open restroom in the shooping street or tour destinations.  :-(", June 2017
52,5.0,"Lovely tree lined place with shopping, cafes!","If you enjoy cafe hopping, this is a must visit on your list. Don't forget to wonder off the main road as that is where many cafes are located and don't forget to look up as most cafes are not located on ground floor.If you live shopping, this is also a great place to visit. Prices here are not like those underground subway shopping, it is more expensive here. However, the style here is different from those sold at the underground subway shops... So it's not apples for apples comparsion.", May 2017
53,3.0,a walk among the chic stores,"both sides of this road are packed with stores, small shops. many can be found in other areas. not as crowded as myeong dong", July 2016
54,3.0,Good for shopping; not as vibrant as Myeongdong,"We aren't big shoppers and were going more for the people watching and to see another part of Seoul.  We had just been in Myeongdong, which I found to be far more vibrant.  Garosu-gil had more American brands (Tommy Hilfiger, Polo, etc.), so wasn't as interesting for us.  Again, if you're just going for people watching & the scene, I would skip this and stay in Myeongdong.", May 2017
55,4.0,Come here to find some designer clothes,"Short shopping street, come here to find some designer clothes. It is a kind of boulevard located not far from the metro station, full of interesting shops (small) with designer clothes. Several cafes are located here also so if you are not interested to buy anything just sit on the terrace with your espresso and watch Korean chicky-micky hipsters ;-))", May 2017
56,4.0,"Lovely, especially for cafe hopping!","The place is lined up with cafes and independent fashion brands, along with some branded shops like Gentle Monster. I would recommend this place to those who want a more chill day in Seoul. The district is not very crowded (since it's more high-end) so it is a good place to hang at when you want to take a breather from Myeongdong or Hongdae.", May 2017
57,2.0,Expensive shopping area,"Quaint shopping area but aside from some nice restaurants, the clothing stores are all the same in every mall and shopping district you visit. There are a lot of the same Uniqlo, Zara, H&Ms etc everywhere and lack of local fashions or works. This area is for people with money, as is all the areas around Apjujeong district. Myeongdong has more variety but it's lower quality.", May 2017
58,5.0,Upmarket shopping area with lot of interesting coffee houses,I was there with a few of my friends. We visiting the trendy shops - some famous brands such as Gentle Monster. This place is more like a museum than a shop selling glasses. You have other cute unique boutiques selling local brands. I adore the coffee shops there - big and great for people watching., May 2017
59,4.0,charming district with trendy people,"What a charming district lined with trees and everyone dresses up so fashionably!Seems like a higher end district but good place to hang out, people watch or just relaxing in a cafe.

Lots of designer local and foreign shops., April 2017
61,5.0,Really liked it,"I went here twice because I liked it so much. They have amazing cafes and nice clothes shops (Mango, Hollister etc). I went on a sunday afternoon and I think it was a good time, because everyone sat outside at a cafe. Don't go in the morning as shops and cafes might still be closed. I would come back here.", April 2017
62,4.0,Cute,We got lost in Gangnam and ended up in this beautiful place. But it was too quiet and was not as fun as Myeongdong., April 2017
63,4.0,Fashionable and pleasant,"I went there on a Monday morning via subway. The ride was pleasant and not packed as I expected it to be as it was 9am at the time. People are definitely dressed a lot more trendy and fashionable here. Had a latte (excellent!) at Coffeesmith (left side of garosu-gil as you turn in and walk a few metres) before I strolled the street as most shops only open at 10:30 or 11am. I must say wi-fi was excellent in that area as I could connect to free wifi as I walked along the street. Tip : Signal is exceptionally strong in front of Sulbing (dessert shop not far from Coffeesmith) and across the street from it. The street has individual shops selling fashionable/trendy clothing & shoes of western and local labels, cosmetics, unique jewellery pieces and plenty of cafes and restaurants.", March 2017

69,4.0,Hip Street,"I always visit Garosu-gil when in Seoul but it's more on the higher end of shopping and dining. The shops are a bit pricier and dining can add up too depending on where you go. They do have cute shops so you'll see a lot of tourists and young crowds hanging out in this area. If you are looking for something more cultural, then I wouldn't really waste too much time here.", April 2016
70,3.0,Nothing special,"Modern street with shops and cafes, could be anywhere in the world,  nothing special.I prefer Bukchon to hang out for coffee!", January 2017
71,3.0,Just a street,Another overhyped area called a tourist attraction for a reason that's beyond me. Shops for luxury brands or just simply local ones that's been gentrified. Cafes and restaurants here and there. There's really nothing outstanding here., February 2016

It reminds me of Chapel St in Melbourne or Bleecker St in New York, small but fashionable. The side streets offer alot of more upscale restaurants while the main drag is mainly boutiques.Nice area to visit but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here.", November 2015

81,4.0,Welcome to the glitz and glamour of South Korea!,"On the one hand, Garosu-gil ""Green Street"" is basically a collection of over-priced restaurants and coffee shops.  On the other hand, if you want to see how the young, rich, and beautiful of Korea spend their afternoons this is the place to go.  Definitely worth visiting for at least 30 minutes before going elsewhere.", October 2016
82,5.0,Trendy slow walk,"Despite some of the other reviews, this is a great area to walk around and slowly drink your cup of coffee.  Enjoy the people watching of this ever-so-trendy neighborhood.  Take in a bite to eat if you have a chance.  Yes, the shops are expensive but it's all about the experience.  If time permits, this area is in close proximity of Hangang Park.  With your second cup of coffee, take a walk over to the river.", October 2016
83,3.0,So so,"Before few years, this was very specialized in unique style shops.

87,5.0,Best place to get coffee in Seoul,"As a coffee drinker, I was pleasantly surprised to find this neighborhood.  Depending on where you are staying in Seoul, Garosu-gil can either be quite convenient or a bit out of the way (as Seoul is such a big city).  Once you get there, however, there is so much to explore and so much coffee to drink!First, the coffee.  I never thought Seoul would have great coffee, but it was hands-down the best coffee I've had in Asia.  There are so many cafes that line this neighborhood that it was so hard to just choose a few to try.  I had a smooth and rich vanilla latte at one cafe and an impeccable cappuccino at another.  One of the best drinks I had, however, was a marron  (chestnut) latte and I don't think there was even coffee inside.  Second, Garosu-gil is also quite a hipster neighborhood, so there are also lots of boutique clothes and artisan shops to explore.  It was definitely worth spending a full day there.", April 2016
88,4.0,Boutique Shops and cafe hopping,"I had a great day with amazing food in the restaurant, yummy latte/ dessert during cafe hopping, enjoyable shopping in the boutique shops and nice walk along the shopping street.

95,5.0,The Beverly Hills of Gangnam,"During the Spring and some summer days, this is probably the closest you'll ever get to feeling like you are in California while traveling in Korea. Garosu-gil translates to ""street of trees"" or something like that. Boutique stores, coffee shops, and restaurants are situated on both sides of the street. I would even recommend going off the beaten path and exploring the side streets. There you will find other places which may tickle your fancy. During weekends expect large crowds.  If you stop in a coffee shop, don't be surprised if the person sitting beside you is famous. Garosu-gil is notorious to see and be seen.", July 2016

120,3.0,Not as charming as expected,"Garosu-gil is beautiful with gingko tree lined streets, upscale urban shopping and too many adorable cafes to count. Think, Soho in NYC.  Its got a European feel and I guess that what I didn't love about it - lacks Korean charm.  Feels like it could be any upscale shopping area in a large city.  Its almost like they are trying too hard NOT to be Korean.  But, the cafes are lovely with emphasis on COFFEE and DESSERTS (Korea is not a tea culture), everyone speaks English fairly well and you can find lots of ""western"" restaurants here - especially pasta and tacos.  A nice stop but I ended up taking subway all the way back to Ssamjil-gil in Insadong where I found WAY more unique things to buy.", April 2016
121,2.0,Has lost its charm over the years,"Like someone else on here said, this area has completely lost its charm. When I visited a few years ago, it was full of independent cafes and very interesting shops to look at. The area also had a very cosy, hippie vibe. You could wander around the side alleys and there was always something interesting to see/buy. I was looking forward to doing that again this time around – but nope. Now all of that is gone and a lot of these unique shops have all been replaced by huge retail/international brands and a lot of cafes have moved to quieter, out-of-the-way places. I was looking around for this lovely café (Bloom and Goute) only to find that they have moved to a really odd area in some alley and had closed down!! Lots of shops have suffered the same fate. There’s also a distinct pretentious and snobby feel to the area, especially coupled with the somewhat stylish people who go there and have coffee and just sit around wanting to be seen. Interestingly, lots of girls in face masks – more than anywhere else I’ve visited in Seoul, possibly just out from one of the many plastic surgery clinics in the area. Almost everything here is overpriced, from the food to the coffee to the clothes and accessories. If you are looking to experience the Real Seoul, just skip this place and go somewhere else. I don’t think it offers much for the casual traveller looking to experience something about the local culture.", April 2016

Loved that the shops were unique and very local and that there were many small Korean restaurants.

It was also crowded and there were too many high end cars and too little parking areas. Very disappointing!", November 2015

Shops there are on the high end side and also cafes were beautifully designed. Cafes and restaurants there are just picture worthy, because of the style and design of the architecture. Truly the vibe is different.We ended up having grilled pork in one of the restaurants there, food was really great and a good run for money.If you have time you can go there and check it out but if love haggling and markets this is not the place to be.", October 2015

163,5.0,Lovely shopping street with wide variety,"Garosu-gil is the tree lined avenue of many a korean drama - relatively narrow and rather pleasant to walk along. I found the shops here to offer a wider variety compared to myeondong, and there were no (or not many) repetitions of brands . in fact most of the shops seem to be those hip/unique ones where there is only one flagship.  Quality was much better than myeongdong and in fact, prices were reasonable. in myeongdong they inflate the prices expecting you to bargain. in garosu-gil all the goods are fixed priced - more suited to my shopping style. Sizes tended to go up to UK12. would recommended to anyone for a stress free shopping day. there's a famous shop along this street which sold a steamboat made of fish and fish entrails.. all i can say is, i tried it and survived, but would not patronize again - however it was full of koreans, no english menu, definitely an authentic korean famous shop.", September 2014

167,3.0,You'd better like shopping or drinking coffee,"Garosugil is the spot in Seoul for shopping, as the street features loads of clothing, accessories and cosmetics shops. Shops are very trendy, yet cheaper that what you could find a couple of blocks East in Apgujeong or Cheongdam. The coffee shop scene, vibrant throughout the city, is even better here. So, if you like high-street fashion and fancy coffee shop drinks, this is the place. however, if you're just looking for ""regular"" clothing, there maybe more options in Myeongdong, or in super malls such as the COEX or the Lotte World Mall. The street is indeed fairly short (a speed-walker could probably go from one end to the other in 15 minutes), and the side streets are not so numerous or bustling - yet, since garosugil has grown a lot recently). The quality of stores might be top notch, but there aren't quite as much as in other areas in Seoul. The dining scene is actually a bit below expectations, especially if you compare with Hongdae, Itaewon or even Myeongdong. Finally, besides the very Garosugil street, there is little else to do in the Northwestern part of Gangnam, so it does feel a bit secluded from other interested places.", April 2015

After you are done pushing past the scores of women with face masks (fresh from a visit to the plastic surgery clinic), you have to prevent yourself from keeling over at the sight of overpriced labels and price tags. While I can accept the place of local high-end boutiques, there are only a few of these here; many of the other shopping options are by your foreign brands.Unless you want to hang out with the crowd here, or need some new clothes to fit your new nose or new chin, I don't think this place offers much for the casual traveller.", November 2014

175,4.0,Boutique clothing shops + trendy cafes for young people,"First thing I noticed about this place was the boutique clothes that are different from the too-similar looking ones in Myeongdong, Dongdaemun and the usual retail chains. Some of the clothes are designed by the shop owners themselves, so they can be really unique, but it also goes to say that they can be on the pricey side.The cafes and restaurants here are divided into Japanese, Chinese, Western and Korean, and for tourists, we might not really want to visit the Japanese, Chinese, Western restaurants when we are already in Korea, so please go and find out where the Korean restaurants and cafes are. There are long stretches of Japanese and Western restaurants nearer to the metro station, hence it can be rather tempting to walk into one before you even step onto the street with Korean restaurants, but don’t do it! Aim for the Korean ones. Even if you choose to visit the Western ones, please be prepared to speak in Korean to the waitress and waiter. Get ready your Korean phrases for “no chili, no spicy” etc, for any special requests that you might have, to prevent regrets.The cafes here are really special, and it is quite cool to just sit in one café for the entire afternoon/night too. Awesome place for young people to come with your friends, and you could come alone too. The only thing I probably regret in this trip is that we allocated too little time for garosugil and did not visit as many cafes as we would have liked. So if you are coming, please plan for at least 4 hours more than what you originally intended.", October 2014

Now is the time you should go see and stroll along the road because there's a lot of fallen leaves with yellow-tinted street lamps and beautiful signboard waiting to be seen- get along the road till you get to Gosu-buji (Han-river Park) and enjoy the park along the river. I lived there for a long time, so my tip is you must see this street when snow has fallen. Couldn't be better! You'd better bring your state-of-the-art camera with you; if you don't have it, you should bring your smart phone. Take a picture and you can get a once-in-a-lifetime picture.

However, there's a great fried chicken place called Hansu Chicken, which is after Forever 21, opposite King Kong Steakhouse.

180,5.0,A great way to spend a Saturday,"A 5 minute taxi drive from the Ritz Carlton hotel in Gangnam, where we were staying, found us on a very popular tree lined road at 11 am along with the first shoppers of the day beginning to see what might be of interest.This street is popular with tourists and locals alike and provides a great range of high street names and local boutique fashion and accessories shops.There are a lot of coffee shops and restaurants in the area and quite a few 'outlet' and ""pop up"" stores with - when we visited - some really good prices.More than the shopping, however, a visit to Garosugil is well worth the trip for the people watching alone. The style of the local fashionistas being very much on display.", August 2014
181,3.0,Upscale Trendy Neighbourhood,Walked along the main street during day time for some interesting Korean designer boutiques. Things here are generally more expensive but they are of higher quality. There are also some shops which caters to the more eccentric fashionista. Walk over to inner streets and you will discover some hidden gems too. Many cafes around too and Mango Six is recommended for a short tea time. A local told me this place is more interesting and happening at night on a weekend. I like this place as it's not overly crowded and much more of a joy to walk around., July 2014
182,4.0,Interesting shopping & cafes,shopping area with trendy cafes & shops. A joy to walk along when the weather is good. plenty of photo opportunities & star gazing (if you know your Korean stars)., July 2014
183,5.0,Good Shopping Fix,"Liked this place as a respite from the usual Korean tourist sites.  They had a lot of more upscale shops with local designers behind it.  We got really cool eye frames, shoes, clothes & a very unique leather bag in this area.  All made locally. Also had our chocolate fix at the Godiva cafe on this street.  Great place to have coffee & watch the trendier ""Gangnam"" folk walk by.  Not unusual to even see some freshly bandaged Koreans walk out of the plastic surgery clinics in the area.Reminds me of New York's Soho district but Korean style.", May 2014
184,5.0,Great Restaurants and Shopping,"I visited a few times, but it's quite interesting. There are so many great restaurants in this area. High end food at mid price on competition. Even restaurants and coffee shops are featured and published in life style magazins like Monocles and Condes Nast. Use the mobile apps to look for venues. Restaurants my friends took were all in weird corners but fully occupied and booked most of time, just like all locals know while tourists like me can't think of going. All worth a visit. There seems more tourists than fancy local girls nowadays, but there are many fancy local designers selling niche stuff like alligator handbags at US$600-700 and cute fashionable t-shirts at US$20-30. Take 3 hours for food and shopping. Maybe a bit longer in case you'd like to sit in the cafe to check out gorgeous local people.", April 2014
185,3.0,Too commercial but yet with quite a lot of local designer shop,"It's not very busy & hanging around there for coffee & some local designer shop is quite leisure, easily kill a couple of hours. But not much excitement, products are commercial rather creative", May 2014
186,4.0,"Great food, shopping and cafe's","This is a great area for an afternoon with the girls or for a quick shopping trip with your family. There are a lot of cafes and unique shops with nice and decently priced clothing. One difficult thing is that there is often only 1 or 2 of each piece and if you are not super thin as many Koreans are, you will have a hard time finding clothes so stick to shoes or grab a drink and people watch.", April 2014
187,5.0,Great food and shopping,"European inspired street Garosu-gil has many upscale boutiques to shop at and street vendors. Kind of reminds me of Newbury Street in Boston. There are also many restaurants to dine at on the street and coffee shops. It's a beautiful street with lots of ginko trees on it, and there are many side streets that have shops on them too. Definitely save one or two days to eat dinner at the restaurants on Garosu-gil!", November 2013
188,4.0,Great Place to chill out,"Better known as ""Shinsa-dong"". It's known to be a boulevard lined with row of small boutique shops.  There are many hip cafes here.  Nice place to spend time here either shopping or just having a coffee, catching up with friends, or watching the crowd.", March 2014
189,4.0,Gingko lined street,"Its a cozy hip place if you're into shopping, cafes and people watching.  Shopping is not cheap but you can stroll around and stop to grab a cup of latte in the array of quirky cafes.", November 2013
190,5.0,My favorite area in Seoul!,"This street was not the easiest to find (exit 8 Sinsa station), but was totally worth the search, it has really nice shops (upscale international and asian but still affordable) and restaurants, some bars. We went in the evening but I would imagine that it would be as nice lunchtime. We also saw a live band in a bar called 'crazy horse' , they were great! Overall compared to other areas in Seoul this was my favorite!", March 2014
191,5.0,"Cafés, fashion boutiques & art","If you're into fashion, food & art then this precinct has it all. The main street is mostly dedicated to fashion stores, both chain brands & boutique stores. The side streets & streets that run behind the fashion shops contains lots of cafés, restaurants & art boutiques. High quality shopping area with restaurants to suit Asian & European tastes. No ""junk food"" outlets here. It's all class, style & chic.", December 2013
192,4.0,"Pretty street, nice cafes","This was a nice pretty place to walk around. There are many pleasant cafes. It was very cold in December though, I think it's nicer to walk around here when it's not winter, Seoul winters are extremely cold.", December 2013
193,3.0,Gives you the cosy and trendy feeling,"I came here to check out the rows of ginkgo trees in autumn. Sadly it was not yet peak foliage when I visited in late October. But I still enjoy walking along Garosu-gil, looking at the small shops, each with its unique deco. The rows of ginkgo trees are still lovely - only that the leaves are still green. I saw many young and trendy Koreans shop here. You can just sit in a cafe and watch people in trendy outfits - like a fashion show on the street. To get here, take line 3 to Sinsa Station (Exit 8). If you have time, yes you should come here to see a different Seoul (unlike hongdae, myeongdong, edae or even apgujeong).", October 2013
194,5.0,"Must Go for Fab Dining, Shopping and Hanging Out","This street is not only pretty, but the another neighborhood is filled with small specialty restaurants, coffee/cake shops, fashion boutiques with a wide variety of local merchandise at different price range. So anyone can find something you like and can afford here. This is one of the most trendy and hip district I've been too.  You will never get tired of this place.  We have tried several restaurants there and we loved them all.  We particularly liked a green bistro called April Market on the side street, we had the best flat bread and an angel hair pasta there!! If you only have 1 day in Seoul and you want to dine, shop till you drop. This is the place to be.", October 2013
195,4.0,Hip shopping,"Good place to shop along a pretty ginkgo tree-lined street. This street must be extra beautiful when autumn sets in and the ginkgo leaves turn into fiery red. Garosu-gil has nice cafes and boutiques. Do take time to wander around the backstreets because there were plenty of interesting corners to see. Oh yes, since it's an upscale shopping area, be ready to spend more money than you should have (a small cup of fresh orange juice from Coffee Bean & Tea Leaves, set me back around KRW80,000).", October 2013
196,5.0,Trendy yet laid back,"Considered the ""cheaper"" version of Apgujeong, Garosugil is the place for younger, trendy crowds and those who wants to see and be seen. Has tons of artsy cafes and stores ranging from the usual fashion house (Forever 21, H&M) to those one of a kind vintage boutiques (9 Owls, Maki). There's an awesome small restaurant/cafe called Table Star (turn right after Smile Market, it will be on the left) which has a superb lunch set for only ₩12,000 that includes a salad, fries, a main course and a drink. Really delicious and worth it, we had to come back a few days later. The lunch set is only available weekdays but their other menu options are great too.Definitely worth going as it is such a laid back place and it's a pleasure just walking around. Be sure to explore the little alleys as that is where most of the gems are.", October 2013
197,5.0,Shop in style and peace.,This is a good place to shop if you want to avoid the uncouth and loud tourist (from you-know-where) that plague Myeongdong and DFS. No peasants shouting from 1 end of the street to another and no rude interruptions when a salesperson attends to you., August 2013

199,5.0,Trendy hangout,"When you are tired of the mall experience and the accompanying kpop blasting stereos and florescent Korean fashion, head to Garosugil for some difference.Here you get fashion items that are eclectic and trendy. There are a couple of vintage stores on the underground level too. Things aren't the cheapest around, but surely much nicer than what you get at the malls.Then stop by for tea or coffee at one of the many nice, um, Aussie inspired cafes? Definitely worth a visit.", June 2013
200,4.0,Trendy,"Garosu-gil is a trendy road filled with name brand shopping and Seoul's beloved coffee shops. I'm not big on the shopping, but it was a nice late evening stroll. For food, we went slightly off the beaten path and found a fantastic little restaurant in one of the off-shoot alleyways. I feel like it's hard to go wrong in Seoul—just look for the restaurants that look packed with locals. And on your way back to the subway station, see if you can count all the plastic surgery buildings.", May 2013
201,3.0,The new street for new restaurants.,"Find all the mediocre western food, japanese food, and cafes, with parking that is difficult.  This is a hot spot right now for the crowds in the mid-20's and early 30's.  It is a common date spot for Koreans, but food wise nothing has been exceptional, but some are pretty good.  Nice little cafes and places to stop and relax during the day time and would recommend a walk down at least once if you are visiting and have the time.", May 2013
202,4.0,Awesome!,"See another side of Seoul instead of just going to tourist hyper shopping places. Garosugil allows you to see how the local lives and shops. It's a nice street and you may catch a glimpse of models or celebrities here. You can find local desingers' shops here with affordable prices. I enjoyed the atmosphere here a lot. Btw, I saw Running Man shooting too when i was there. Couldn't hide my excitement!", April 2013

204,3.0,Seoul's Vancouver's Robson Street,"This reminded me so much of Vancouver's Robson Street.  A tree lined avenue of various buildings, all unique and interesting, at least superficially.  If I am a Seoulite of some means I would likely enjoy hanging out here at the cafes and european influenced restos and boutiques.Lots of fashion, nice bites and beautiful people watching here.  It's comfortable and quiet, away from the masses scrambling at Dongdaemun for a scarf or jacket. Of course, I'd never be seen there, plus there's no place to park my BMW.  I'd prefer to have a nice French meal followed by espresso and pastries. But since I'm not a local nor of any great means, you'll more likely find me down at Gwangjang Market chewing on a pig's food, drinking makgeolli from a paper cup.", November 2012
205,3.0,Trendy shops and restaurants alongside roadside stalls.,"It was about 4pm when I reached Garosu-gil expecting an exclusive shopping area. To my surprise, there were many roadside stalls selling fashion accessories. However, there's a handbag museum that's worth a visit.", November 2012
206,4.0,We went back twice,I like this area because the area is quieter than the others. You can shop comfortablly. There are not restaurant & bar.The pricing of everything seems to be fair. However do not expect very cheap products for sale., October 2012
