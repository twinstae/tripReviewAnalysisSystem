0,4.0,"Very Good. By the way, Inwangsan is better for wall walking","This is about 90~120 min wall walking on Bugaksan Mountain. It's really good walking(or easy hiking) on the mountain. But, with some restrictions, I think Inwangsan Seoul Fortress gives a better satisfaction.  - This is the part of Seoul Fortress securing Hanyang(former name of", January 2019
1,3.0,Quite a disappointment,"Firstly, come here only if you want exercise and views and nothing else.We came for the historical part of it and was disappointed. The bullet ridden tree was such a let-down. They had removed all the bullets, applied cement over it to close up the hole, then painted a very fake looking red and white bulls eye over the supposed bullet holes.Didn't see no soldiers guarding the place.And yes - the stairs are really quite grueling!We carted up 1.5L of water per person based on other reviews. We drank at most 1L each. And we went on a hot summer day at noon. Most of it is quite shady thanks to the treesWould I recommend this to anyone? NO! Unless you enjoy hiking 2 hours to look at fake bullet holes. View was quite nice tho but you get the same thing at Namsan Hill with a fraction of the effort", June 2018
2,4.0,History and exercise,We had a good trek up the fortress walls and were rewarded with a great view of the surrounding town and good exercise.Recommended to come here in the morning to avoid potential crowds and also to work up an appetite for lunch later, May 2018
3,4.0,Strenuous Climb from Changuimun Gate to Samcheong Park,"I probably should have done my homework a bit better and read other reviews that recommended climbing Seoul City Wall beginning at the western part of the wall at the Malbawi Information Center.  Instead I started my ascent at the Changuimun Gate.  As others have said, this is a restricted military area and one must show a resident card or passport and sign in.  You will be given a badge to wear for the duration of your climb, and boy what a climb it was.  I cannot say I am in the best shape so this was very strenuous and hard on the knees.  At points I thought it was never going to end but the views were worth it and I met many nice people along the route.  It also was not very crowded.  I started my journey around 1330 and ended up at Samcheong Park around 1600.  Make sure you bring plenty of water.  There are no restrooms or facilities along the way.  Pictures of the city are restricted in many areas, with the 121 bullet tree a stark reminder of why this is a military zone.  I will say the tree was further away from the Blue House than I thought it would be.  I took a picture of it as I doubt I will be adventurous enough to try this walk again...even if I began from the other direction!!!  I probably should have exited from Waryong Park but was told it would be easier to catch a cab by Samcheong Park--that was a good 1/2 trek from the Malbawi Info Center, but luckily it was largely downhill.  In the end I found a bus as I exited the park that dropped me off in front of the Sajong Performing Arts Center and picked up the metro from there.  Altogether I am glad I did this but boy were my legs aching the next day.", August 2016
4,5.0,enjoyable hike with beautiful views,"My son and I did a day trip to visit all the remaining gates of seoul fortress. We started at the Malbawi Information Center and hiked to the Changuimun Information Center. This course was easier than hiking from the Changuimun Gate.Depending on your level of fitness, the hike may take between 2 - 2 1/2 hours. The steps should not be underrated as they are very steep in some areas. There are no toilet or garbage facilities after reaching the Malbawi Center, so ensure that you have sufficient water and carry your garbage with you until the end of the hike.Malbawi Information Center may be reached by taking subway line 3 to Anguk Station, then bus # 2 to Sungkyunkwan University Rear gate. There is no visible bus stop at the university, but it will be clear that you are at the last stop. It is the stop after the entrance to Waryog Park, and is a steep climb uphill. I think that it was the 8th bus stop from Anguk. Continue to walk uphill for 5 minutes and the Seoul Fortress wall will be seen. Walk along the path next to the wall for 600 meters, always keeping the wall in view on your left, and you will reach Malbawi information Center. It should be noted that there are few signs in English , and at one point a small foot bridge is passed and a really steep staircase that when climbed takes you over the wall. When on the other side of the wall, the malbawi Information center is a 5 minute walk away.Passports have to be provided for inspection and a form filled out, after which an ID tag will be received. This tag is placed around your neck and will have to be returned to Changuimun/Malbawi Information Center after your hike is completed. Guards are posted at regular intervals along the trail, and photos may only be taken at the following areas: Sukjeongmun gate, Baegakmaru, Chatdaebawi Rock, 1.21 Pine Tree, Baegak Rest area and Dolrae Rest Area. If in doubt, ask the guard if you can take a photo.The hike offers beautiful views of Seoul, and the North and Northwest gates of Seoul Fortress. At the Changuimun Gate there is a bronze statue and memorial stone for soldiers who died during the 1.21 incident. Buses to Gwanghwamun Square can be easily taken by crossing the road at Changuimun gate.", July 2016
5,5.0,Excellent views of Seoul for the strong hiker,"My wife, 5 year old son and I did this hike from Hyehwamun Gate to Changuimun Gate over a duration of about 4 hours. My son is very active, a strong hiker, and had no problem with the physical challenge. My wife and I are fit but nevertheless our legs were quite sore by the end of the hike. From the direction we came (East to West) there is a very steep 300m decsent at the end of the hike which was difficult on the knees. The views of Seoul are fantastic. The view looking down on the royal palace is interesting. This hike was not available to civilians until it was opened in 2012. This is a military zone due to the proximity to the Korean presidential residence and photos are restricted. Bring your passport (visitors) or alien registration card (residents) if you are not a Korean citizen.", July 2016
6,5.0,Unexpected fortress in the middle of the city,"In the area of hyehwa, it's supposedly known for buskers and street performers. While finding a park, my friend and i chanced upon this uphill battle and realized it was a hill. It's not high, but has a great view of Seoul city. The remnants of the fortress allows you to take nice pictures too. However, sunset does not look too good on the hill..If you want, you can walk towards Sindang. You'll come across the mural village that was featured in Running Man (the one where they kicked their shoes up the stairs).It is a far walk though.", June 2016
7,5.0,Morning Shuttle (One-Way) Hike with Commanding Views,"Here's an idea for a morning commune with nature with some sightseeing of the ancient city wall and vistas to boot.  Take a taxi to the entrance of Samcheong Park off of Bukchon-ro.  Walk about half an hour uphill following the signs to Malbawi Lookout.  At the information desk you will be asked to complete a little form and show your passport and you will be given a visitor tag attached to a lanyard to wear.  Pick up an English language map if you wish.  Now get ready for an hour of good fun with stairclimbing (at the fastest pace with only one quick camera stop) going up to reach Mt. Bukason and then down to Changuimun Gate where you will return the tag, walk down a flight of stairs and take a taxi home.  Of course, this is not only one way to do the hike of the northern wall and you can feel free to hike part or the full way and return to your starting point.  The strategic importance of the commanding heights cause the ROK army to be on trail maintenance duty so the developed trail is about as pristine as I have ever seen.  The July Pine Tree with bullet holes (North Korean assassin squad had it taken to them in spades!) is curious.  DO NOT FORGET YOUR PASSPORT AND WATER BOTTLE!", June 2016
8,5.0,millions of stairs,"I took the Waryong Park to Changuimun course, and the amount of stairs are no joke. I consider myself fairly fit but I was huffing away at some sections of stairs. The course was not very clearly marked and I had to ask the guards stationed all around to make sure I was going the right way. The scenery made up for it, you could see right across Bugaksan Mountain on a clear day. Remember to bring your passport as registration is a must, and bring plenty of water and some snacks or energy bar. I will hike this trail again when I go to Seoul next time.", April 2016
9,3.0,Start from Hyehwa,"If you have a little more time on your hands, you can also start from Hyehwa subway station. The walk from the subway station to Sungkyunkwan University is through a nice shopping/cafe area, where you can grab some coffee, lunch or fruit juice. The university has a small entrance in the wall from the street that runs along its west side (Sungkyunkwan-ro 5-gil), head for the old buildings and check out the lecture hall and the ages old gingko tree. Then take the back gate to Waryong park (look up this location on your smartphone). From there, everything is well signed: follow the signs to Malbawi to get to the start of the military area. From there, you can only go one way: the westward one, which is, as others pointed out, the right way to do this hike, as it ends with the endless staircase downwards.On the other hand, the Hyehwa quarter is also a great place to end your day in one of its many bars and restaurants!", May 2016
10,4.0,Wonderful hike in Seoul,"Thanks to the other reviewers' recommendation, I took the hiking course from Waryong Park to Changuimun. The steps in Changuimun are probably in hundreds or thousands...so please do not start from this gate. The view was excellent but unfortunately on the day of my hike there was fog and I could not see gyeongbukgung well. The hike takes around 2hrs with rest and photo shoots. I like that it's easily accessible and quite easily done, ...if you start from Waryong Park.", November 2015
11,5.0,Hiking bugaksan,"Have you ever try hiking in other country?? I did, when I came to seoul couple weeks ago, I decided to try hiking becouse I heard that korean people loved to do this activity on weekend, in fact they have on store that only sells hiking equipment, and they did it with family, college and friend even with they lover, so after browsing I found out that bugaksan is the simple one, I choose it. After get off from bus at sungkyuhwan gate University, we walk to waryong park for 10 min, and we ask people how to get to malbawi information and he said about 20 mnt along the wall, actially we walk about an hour and the track is like climbing mountain before we met wood stairs and up again to go to malbawi, after signing a paper and show our passport, we enter the fortress through 2 guards, and continue our hiking, we meet many people, mother with doughter, lovers, spouse, college, friends, actually it saturday, but we only walk slowly while enjoy the view and decide to go back after few kilos, we think were not like hiking, even in the straight road we didnt like walking..but we enjoy the view, we can see downtown seoul from the above, the long wall, the trees that start to become red, the handsome guard, we glad we did it..", November 2015
12,5.0,"Beautiful views, but hard on the knees!","Great afternoon walk up the stairs with lots of areas to restalong the way. Saw the Blue House from above. Rigorous climb for bad knees, but worth at least 2/3 of the way.", October 2015
13,5.0,"Great place,amazing ","I really like this place,wow is so great place that you can se the city,eazy to find near to subway.place that you can relax on your mind", October 2015
14,5.0,A Healthy Escape,"The Fortress has around 4 'gates' that make up the 18.2km of the trail.  We walked about 4.8km of the trail and absolutely loved it.  At different times, you can see the city from different angles, but more importantly, you're in the fresh air of the mountains that surround the city.You have to show your passport or similar type of ID in order to walk the trail, but it's free and very healthy.  In the past, No. Korea soldiers have attacked the fortress and there's evidence along the trail.  You have to be quite healthy before attempting certain parts of the trail and you should bring at least a litre of water with you, especially if it's hot and humid.", September 2015
15,5.0,Nice trail walk for family in the city,"To safe time, we simply took a taxi to our starting point, Waryong Park from Myeongdong. By taxi actually cost less than the subway (4 person fare). We hiked through Sukjeongmun and finished at Changuimun. The whole journey took about 2 to 3 hrs. The veiw and scenery is pretty unique and you will be amazed to see young soldier holding M16 running to their guard post. Remember to bring your passport because the main route is a restricted area. One more tip, don't take the easterly direction (Changuimun to Waryong Park) which many tourist book suggested. The uphill staircase will kill you. The westerly route (Waryong Park to Changuimun) is much easlier since Waryong Park is already in mid peak.", August 2015
16,5.0,I never miss a hike,Living in Seoul - this beautiful city - I am always inspired by the rich tradition meeting modernity.  And walking the wall every weekend I am in town is always special.  Now it is huge so I never walk the entire thing.  But even a simple 20-30 minutes will leave you wanting more.  Make sure you are prepared for a work out    Don't rush and certainly bring some water.  Enjoy the views and the many visitors on the weekends.  Will be there again this weekend.  See you there!, July 2015
17,5.0,A great experience!,"The views are fantastic and there are rest stops along the way where you can take a break. Bring water and a snack. We walked the main section of the wall and talked with some Korean locals at various points, and two Australians each doing the hike solo. The entire outing took the better part of a day since we also walked there and back from Insadong where we were staying. We explored interesting neighborhoods on the way, and stopped for a beer at an art bar/cafe on the way back. I'd do this again the next time I am in Seoul. IMHO it's better to walk the route east to west, as there are many stairs and a fast upward rise on the west side.", June 2015
18,5.0,A very satisfying hike!,"Others have provided the details on how to get there, so I will only add that because I was a little tight on time I took a taxi from Anguk Station to Waryong Park, hoping that I would get closer to the actual wall entrance that way.  I could not - the taxi literally followed the bus and did not save me any time.  Fortunately it only cost about 3000 won, but I advise that you stick to the bus.I went west on the 2.2 km section that is in the military zone. I'm a fast walker but a slow climber, and I like to take every little side trail to a lookout to make sure that I didn't miss anything.  This hike took me 1 hr 45 min. I went early in the day (opens at 9 am) so that it would not be too hot while I was walking.I loved looking down on the palace, from which I had looked longingly up at the mountain on an earlier day.  It gives a sense of history and the geographical strategic location of Seoul.  Strenuous but highly recommended.", June 2015
19,4.0,Central yet secluded,"I love how central it was located in Seoul, yet it felt so secluded with the fact that there was not much crowd visiting the place compared to other hills/mountains in Seoul. This is a place that I would go again if I live in Seoul and looking for a hill to have a short and easy hike. The hill had wonderful view of the city, whereby Seoul’s main attractions like the major palaces can be seen from the hill. During the hiking, we bumped into the South Korean armies but it did not give us any uncomfortable feeling. There were some areas whereby we were forbidden from taking photos, but they were not clearly marked. Other than that, just be reminded that it closes on Mondays.", October 2014
20,4.0,Lots and lots of stairs,"We started the the trail from Waryong Park and ended in Changuimun Gate. To get to Waryong Park, go to Anguk Station, Exit 2 and take bus 2 from the bus stop right outside the exit. Get off at the stop called Waryong Park (which seemed more like the back gate of Sungkyunkwan Uni and nowhere like a park) and walk up slope along the road until you really reach Waryong Park.Malbawi Information Centre is still ~30mins walk away from Waryong Park. There, you will need to fill up a form and register using your passport. After which, a tag will be passed to you which you will have to wear for the rest of the hike until you reach Changuimun. The information centre also have toilet facilities and you can fill up on water too.There seemed to be a few side trails but as a rule of thumb, we just followed the fortress wall. The down side of this is that part of the view is blocked by the wall. In addition, photo-taking is not allowed for some places (generally in the direction of the Blue House), and there are guards along every few metres to ensure that. However, you still can catch a good view of Seoul city.The trail comprises of ascends and descends until the peak at Baekakmaru and where the view is not to be missed. The real descend comes after Baekakmaru and is done by walking down stairs and more stairs until Changuimun. I was glad I did not start the route from Changuimun gate. There are simply too many stairs to climb. To get to metro station from Changuimun Gate, follow the sign to Gyeongbokgung until you reach the main road, cross the road and take bus 7022 or 7212 to Gyeongbokgung Station.Will recommend to do the hike towards the end of your vacation in Seoul as my calf muscles were aching for the next few days from walking all that stairs.", May 2015
21,4.0,Great Views of the City,"Lots of stairs and uphill walking--so be prepared for that before you go by wearing good shoes and appropriate attire. You will need your passport to get in, but it isn't a hassle at all to check into the area. There were a lot of places you couldn't take pictures--some were not marked well. If we weren't sure, we would just ask the guard standing nearest to us. They were very pleasant and didn't seem to mind.", June 2014
22,5.0,Must go,"Beautiful view. You must go because photos are restricted, and you won't be able to experience the beauty through viewing those photos uploaded onto the internet. Bring your passport, wear comfortable clothes (best not to wear jeans and dresses/skirts) and a good pair of walking/hiking shoes. Depending on the route you take, it might be useful for you to bring a hiking pole as a certain section of the trek would be rather steep. Try not to plan another activity into the same day so that you can spend as much time here as possible. Likewise, don't bring too many things with you in your bag, you will definitely regret halfway through the journey. Trust me, you won't need those things at all. No need for coats, scarfs etc in autumn, the exercise will warm you up. You can go with your friends, family, or alone. Not for those travelling with young children because the steps are tall.", October 2014
23,5.0,"Hiking, Hiking, Hiking","I spent two mornings hiking in Northern Seoul city.  You can reach the Seoul fortress from Jongno area by foot, bus or taxi and it is simply quite stunning location.  The fortress itself requires you to bring your passport to enter.  You then have the choice of left of right.  Right direction leads to the East Gate and West leads to the west gate.  The east side is far more gentle and accommodating, and leads you through some lovely neighbourhoods and residential districts.  Note that in the gap section, you have to walk past the high school, down the hill to Eksu and then through the theatre district up the hill behind the Arko theatre to rejoin the wall trail.  TO the West, it is abundant nature, long trails and steep hills, most of it is paved or has wooden walk way.  It is easy to get lost, but that is part of the fun, as if you follow the trail, you will eventually get back to somewhere where there are buses and subway.  Make sure that you check out the wall with the bulletholes from North Korean soldiers.", July 2014
24,5.0,Awesome walk and rewarding views,"Bugaksan was one of my favorite sights I visited - despite being restrictive in photography, one can still enjoy the beauty and views of the area with the eye. There is high security on the trail and many cameras watching you due to its proximity to the Blue House (Cheongwadae). The walk is not difficult - the entire path is well marked and paved, only once or twice did you have to walk on some unpaved areas - which had been well groomed and cleared. If you are tired, there are rest areas (but no toilets).Tip: Start from the Malbawi Information Centre (Waryong Park/Anguk Station end) as it is the easier course and has more frequent (and visible) transport options back towards the city. Starting at the other end, Changuimun, means a steep uphill climb up stairs... recommended for those who want a challenge. Passport for foreigners is a must.", April 2014
25,4.0,Very nice view over the city,"Try this trip if you want to get closer to the nature. There is a trail through the Waryong Park and then walking by the fortress wall. You will get a really nice view over Seoul and mountains surrounding the city. It is a military area so remember to take your passport (you will need to register and show your passport to get a pass). Take some comfortable shoes. We took subway to Anguk Station, exit 2, and then bus no. 2 that departs like 10 meters from this exit. Bus ride takes about 10 minutes, we got off on the last stop and walked from there.", April 2014
26,5.0,"It's beautiful but tired, worth it!",It's tired to do the climbing though but it's definitely worth it for the beauty-ness you see while you climb. Spent about 2 hours there so i guess you would spent around that timing there too! Really nice place., October 2013
27,3.0,Caution Required! Beautiful/Exhausting.,"Seoul Fortress is on the recommended list of almost every guide book, and also promoted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government (""SMG""). I figured (incorrectly) that it was a touristy thing to do. It isn't for everyone.I used the walking route on the SMG website. Adding the fact that I got slightly lost near the Hyehwamun area for about 10-15 minutes, it actually took me almost 3 hours to get from the Hansung University Station to the bus stop nearest Changuimun. The first tip is this -- if you can't walk and climb for three hours (with short rest stops), this isn't for you.  Sure, it's paved and all, but you will be walking for a long time, and it's steep is several places. The 2.2 km distance is just the secured area. I think getting to the secured area on foot from Hansung University station is another 2.5 km (not sure). Don't take that for granted.Not taking that for granted also includes the following:a. Eat beforehand and bring some food if you can -- there are no stores to buy food along the way. b. Bring water -- I had a bottle of water that I had to refill at the security checkpoint because I walked so long half a liter of water was not enough even for half the route, and I couldn't buy any along the way.c. Consider the weather -- it's not just about walking for three hours; it's doing it at a certain temperature so unless you're sure you can sustain walking in the cold/heat or wet/dry, think again.I found that listening to music on my iPod distracted me from what I wanted to do, which was cry. It was so cold and tiring. I think the difficulty of the walk surprised me, which was why I was unhappy.This is not to  say I regret going there. The place was really lovely. 4.5/5 for lovely -- mountains, trees, the city visible from the heights. I had to give it a 3/5 overall, though, because it was very difficult for me. Other tips:a. Someone at the forum told me that taking the walk in the opposite direction is worse. Yup. It's steeper to climb from Changuimun to Hyehwamun.b. There aren't enough English signs -- well, not as many as other places in Seoul. I recall that in the secured area, there were crossroads at some point, and the signs were in Hangul. Thank God I could read. There's more than one route, you see -- I could have ended up somewhere else, i.e., not exiting Changuimun.c. No reservation required so just show up! there's a cut-off in terms of time so make sure you make it in time to enter the secured area.d. Passport required to enter (I'm not Korean).e. They were not kidding about the place being guarded by the military. There was a soldier every few meters throughout the secured area. If you come from a country where you are unused to soldiers and barbed wire, it's pretty freaky. I was scared although no one bothered me while I walked.f. Going back to the city from Changuimun? Cross the street and take the bus from the opposite direction. Research beforehand on what bus to take from there -- there are three buses stopping at Changuimun.Recommended for the strong and healthy, and fans of natural beauty.I could come back, but on a warmer day, when I am fed and hydrated.", March 2013
