0,4.0,Paying my respect ,"Last week I went to visit Seodaemun Prison - a former prison that first opened in 1908. It was used during the Japanese colonial era where Korean Freedom Activists were imprisoned and tortured. After the colonial era ended in 1945, the prison was used by Korean government until", January 2020

2,4.0,Worth seeing.  ,"Prison was in use until the late 1980s.  Good discussion of Japanese imperial prisoner treatment, less discussion of post Japanese political prisoners.  Some translation available", January 2020
3,4.0,Brutal reality of history & japanese occupation,"Although not touted as one of the more popular tourist attractions when visiting Seoul, this is worth a visit.  Easily accessible via subway (Dongnimum stop) - very short walk from subway exit with signs well marked from subway exit to entrance of site.  While there are some english translations, there are portions which are in korean only.  There is an app you can download that will give you audio descriptions of certain exhibits but we had a hard time accessing it.  Tours in english and other languages can be arranged but when I spoke with the ticket person (my korean, tho not fluent is sufficient so I was able to communicate with people on site to learn this) you need to book a guide at least a month in advance.  There is a main exhibit hall but you will be walking outside to access other buildings within the complex.  Some of the buildings are (somewhat heated) but be prepared for cold temps even inside some of the other buildings.  (Note we went in winter, but my guess is that in summer, there's no a/c in those buildings so be prepared to deal with heat and humidity in July/Aug) The day we went was particularly cold with temps about 30F/-1C - which gave us a insight into the horrible conditions the prisoners endured.  The exhibit itself provides basic timeline info and good detail into how the prison came to be, to the day to day conditions there.  Particularly gruesome is the ""torture"" sections which show the awful physical and mental acts of brutality that was inflicted upon the prisoners.The other buildings have been preserved and in some of the areas there are tributes and info on some of the political dissidents and leaders that endured (or died) there.  But again, some of those sections are only in korean.", December 2019
4,4.0,A monument to brutality and freedom,This museum is strikingly different from every other historical site that we visted in Korea. It's quite raw in its preservation of the buildings and in its descriptions of the crimes committed here by the Japanese and the Korean miltary government. The photographs in the women's block strike home., November 2019
5,4.0,"Interesting historical site, try to avoid the school tours ","Well thought out museum that gives an insight into Korea’s history and their relationship to Japan. As others have mentioned, if you are unfortunate enough to coincide your visit with a school tour then this really detracts from the experience. It is difficult to be affected by the torture cell displays when you are surrounded by screaming kids whose teachers do not control them. The museum staff also do not intervene. I also liberated a young man who had been locked in a cell by his ‘friends’.", October 2019

8,5.0,Piece of history,"It's very easy to get there, by using the Orange subway line, hence I would absolutely recommend going. If gives you an amazing insight, of the status of Korea, during the Japanese occupation. Even if you're not to interested in history, it's worth to pay a visit to get a general view.", November 2018
9,4.0,educational experience,"Easy to get to this interesting museum from the City Tour Bus or subway - line 3 (Orange line) to Dongnimmun station, Exit 5 and a very short walk to the entrance.  Open from 0930-1800 in the summer months and 0930-1700 in the winter Tuesday - Sunday.  Entrance is only 3000 won per adult and, if you are really into history of this time period, it is possible to arrange for a docent guided tour in English, Japanese, or Chinese a week in advance.  Recommend reasonable walking shoes and weather appropriate gear as the museum has several buildings to walk between and rain or excessive cold could make it a little uncomfortable.  Time spent here varies on your interest in the subject -- there are exhibits enough to spend almost a whole day here however, a good overview could be completed in 1.5 - 3 hours.The Seodaemun Prison History Hall/museum is separated into several sections that cover 80 years of history (1908 to 1987) of the Seodaemun Prison.  The different exhibitions offer information regarding the Korean peoples struggle for independence during the Japanese colonization and the life of those imprisoned by the Japanese in these halls due to their roles in the independence movement.  It is a striking presentation of this relatively recent bit of history.  Most of the exhibitions have English translations.  It does get a little crowded and school groups do come through.  Not the first museum I would recommend visiting when in Seoul however, worth it if you have the time.", July 2019
10,5.0,History learning,"This is formally used as a prison during Japanese Colonial Age. Now, it's a history museum for locals and foreign visitors.- The area is huge and there's not enough air conditioning. Try to avoid visiting in hot summer.- Things are well-maintained. Torture cells locating B1F are hideous.- A large Tageukgi(Korean national flag) on the wall of the building is a popular photo spot. Local visitors take photos saying 'manse(hurrah)' as mourning sacrifices in the past- The entrance fee was 3,000 won and it's a bit surprising because many museums or memorial halls in Seoul are free.", September 2019

12,5.0,wow,"I was not expecting it to wow me but the setup was actually very good.  It was not just empty rooms but displays and explanations of what each room and each building represented during its active days. Huge place as well. It shows how it was before, and the struggle by Koreans just to gain independence.  This is one attraction that helps explain why South Koreans are very nationalistic and very proud of their independence.", June 2019
13,4.0,Seodaemun Independence Park,"We were at Seodaemun Independence Park which leads to the Seodaemun Prison History Hall. We didn’t get to visit the Prison as it was quite late in the afternoon and near the closing time.The park is like a green oasis compared to the noisy traffic just blocks away.There is a impressive archway, located at the entrance of the park, which was modelled after the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. This was where previously the envoys sent by the Chinese emperors to Korea were being received.There are stairs which leads to Dongnimmun metro station. Very convenient.", June 2019
14,5.0,Really interesting place ,I would certainly come here if you are in Seoul. Set in a peaceful park it is hard to imagine this was a big prison for Koreans fighting for independence who were kept here by the Japanese. You can going into the cells and learn about the torture endured. It is a huge place. Took us about 2 hours to get around. Most of it is in English but it does sort of give up in a few areas. The main messages were were translated and delivered. There’s a gift shop., June 2019
15,4.0,Very  humbling experience,"I was very lucky to have a free tour guide for this. A very intelligent and well spoken kid ( he was only 14! ) was offering free guide for foreigners. Now everything became more meaningful as he went over the entire history of the prison and of Korea during those days. I do understand even better now why Japanese are not well-liked in Korea. Lots of kids with their teachers,  which is great. Respect for all the martyrs. Do yourself a favor and visit this place.", May 2019
16,5.0,Make this a priority,Visit with a local or a guide to better understand the history behind the prison hall. We were fortunate to tour the place with Luke from Meteor Youth Voluntary Club. He was well versed with the history and walked us through the exhibits providing interesting information and anecdotes of the famous prisoners incarcerated there. A solemn place indeed makes one marvel again at human courage and self sacrifice of these individuals., June 2019
17,5.0,Seodaemun Prison History Hall,"Nowadays, Koreans can enjoy a modern, democratic and independent country. There are many factors in South Korea’s success. In order to understand why South Korea is the way it is now, we have to look back in the past to see how everything started and to understand a long, painful way Koreans have passed.Empire of Japan had interests in seizing the Korean peninsula. In 1905, they made Korea their colony, finalizing in effective annexation in 1910. Korean emperor, Gojong, tried to seek for help from western powerful countries but nobody came to the rescue and Japanese could colonized, with violence, Korea. Few can imagine all the suffering and oppression that Koreans had to live during Japanese colonial rule. Japan ruled directly through the military and any Korean dissent was ruthlessly crushed. They build a colonial prison in 1908 that served as a major site of oppression during Japanese forced annexation. Seodaemun Prison, firstly named Gyeongseong Prison, was built to accommodate 500 inmates, considering that the entire capacity of all prisons around the country was of 300 inmates only, but as Japanese full-scale aggression initiated into Korea, many Koreans independence activist started rising. Therefore, these fighters got arrested and imprisoned there, raising the population of the prison reaching more than 3000 people around 1919 as many patriots were imprisoned during the March 1st Independence movement. Until independence was achieved in 1945, many independence fighters were executed or died from the brutal treatment received in the prison.Metal bars, cold bricks and guards from the prison could not silenced loud voice seeking for restoration of sovereignty nor could break down their loyal spirit inherited from the Righteous Army in the Joseon dynasty. Within the prison’s corridors “Daehan Dongnip Manse!” (Long live the independence of Korea) could always be heard. And little by little, it started uniting all Koreans into one purpose, independence. Korean independence activists created organizations domestically and overseas were they planned resistance strikes. They used many strategies as a method to push forward the recovery of Korea’s national sovereignty, especially the ‘Heroic Struggle’, in my opinion is the smartest tactic that could be done considering the conditions they were living in, which targeted Japanese figures and pro-Japanese Koreans with violence trying to make heavy blows to the Japanese imperialists.Nowadays, Seodaemun prison is a museum that shows all the pain and struggle that patriots suffer within its prison cells. You can see how their spirit was unbreakable and you can share all the oppression and humiliation caused by Japanese. Even though the prison is empty, the independence patriots’ spirit can still be felt.100 years has passed since the March 1st Movement rallied the Korean people against oppressive Japanese colonialism. This epoch-making movement, their actions and their activist should never be forgotten because from it we can learn that freedom and peace are not given for free, you must fight for them. We should keep this legacy of our ancestors and treasure it because these are two biggest gifts we could inherit. In order to have a brighter and better future, it is important to learn from our past. As a final remark, we think, Yu Gwan-Sun words: “Even if my fingernails are torn out, my nose and ears are ripped apart, and my legs and arms are crushed, this physical pain does not compare to the pain of losing my nation” wraps the inherit spirit of every Korean.", April 2019
18,2.0,Would have loved to learn more,"In the first building there was at least some general description in English in each display, although the description for the individual items were almost exclusively in Korean. In the second building there is no description at all in English, it’s all in Korean, and very detailed it seems like. I would love to know what they said. I asked the staff if there was a guided tour or an audio guide in English, but no such luck. A lot of the written information in English seems to have gone through Google translate, because sometimes it was tricky to decipher the actual meaning. There is a lot of focus on the atrocities carried out by the Japanese colonial regime, and rightfully so. But it barely even mentions that it was used for more than 40 years by the South Korean dictatorship which was not known for treating dissidents kindly. Moreover, there were a lot of schoolchildren running around shouting and laughing, which didn’t feel very respectful.", May 2019
19,5.0,Should-not-be-missed place to learn about history of Korean people,"It was on 5th May, which is Children Day in Korea, a beautiful day with blue sky, cool breeze and of course holiday break. I awarded myself a visit to Seodaemun prison to know more about Korean history and I was so curious to discover a different part of Seoul. This place seems like to be out of the beaten track for many tourists visiting Seoul, including myself. Before coming to Korea, I have not heard about Seodaemun prison. Seodaemun used to be a prison since 1910 by Japanese to torture and later execute Korean Independence Movement followers. The first thought pop into my mind was that this place would be scary, dark and horrible, and it was indeed horrible and terrifying once I entered the museum. I feel a bit guilty to say this but for someone having no idea about Seodaemun’s history; however, this place is a hidden gem of a hustle and bustle Seoul, stunning red-bricks halls, large playing ground with some green corners with a green grass field, trees and flowers… It was a bit crowded today, many school students and families visiting (probably because it was on Sunday and Children Day). I walked around the courtyard first, enjoying the nice weather and alive vibe at the courtyard.Walking around, I did not believe that these buildings used to be a horrific hell, where people were jailed, starved, tortured and killed. All the nicely elegant appearance outside of these red-brick wall buildings was completely deceitful. Inside the exhibition hall, there was a number of artefacts grouped into several displays, relating to the Independence Movement in Korea and the terrible mistreatment and torture of Japanese during their colony period. The basement under exhibition hall was not the place for the faint of a heart person, it was extremely unthinkable acting of violence. I have seen these terribly horribly unsympathetic torture methods for many times, but I still could not stand with it for any seconds. It was so dreadful that I just wanted to get out. I watched the video of an old man who was a Korean patriot. Seeing what he suffered after being ceiled here in Seodaemun, I just could not hold my tear and I do not think any of us can fully understand the hardship he and other people hold here suffered and their strong belief and determination to fight for the independence of their country and for freedom and happiness of their people. I still remember his saying “I am happy now because all Korean people are now happy”.  Seodaemun prison was now served as the special museum in remembrance of the dark history of Korean and Korean patriots. This place could be a bit of propaganda against the Japanese to someone. Just leaving the anti-Japanese attitudes I so often hear, however, this place, filled with its dark history, is a historic place to teach people, especially youths, about the sacrifice that made up Korea today, the value of independence and freedom and the horror of the war. Personally, this visit was an emotional experience, knowing more about the history of Korean people and discovering another part of Seoul. As Winston Churchill said, “Those that fail to learn from history, are doomed to repeat it”. So, I do hope that there will be no more wars around the world and there will be no such horrific mistreatment that happened here in Seodaemun will be repeated any other places.How to get there:[Subway] Dongnimmun Station (Seoul Subway Line 3), Exit 5. You can easily see the guidance to the entrance of prison right after leaving exit 5.", May 2019
20,5.0,Profound experience-highly recommended,"Easy access-right off of Dongnimun subway stop. Brought my teenage son so he could get a sense of the Japanese occupation and the Korean resistance movement.  We had visited the Seoul Museum of History the day before, but the Seodaemun Prison History Hall truly brought the content alive.  There’s no comparison to walking the actual grounds where political prisoners were once held. As others have commented, I only wish more of the exhibits were translated to English.  Also I noticed there were tributes to student/worker/pro democracy activists, but they were only in Korean, and I wish I could’ve understood what they said.", March 2019
21,5.0,Chills on prison hall,The place is starting to get crowded because they are celebrating their March 1 Independence movement.  You can tour the whole facility for 45mins - 1.5hrs.Close to Seodaemun Independence park., February 2019
22,4.0,Impressive,"A visit to the Seodaemun Prison will leave a lasting impression. We went on a calm Sunday morning. From the subway station (exit 5) you will walk straight to the former prison. The museum details the cruelties commited by the Japanese in the early 20th century, but gives little information about the time when the prison was in use during the second half when a lot of Koreans whom critiques the Korean government were imprisoned there.", January 2019
23,4.0,"Easy to get to, moving exhibits, but noisy groups","Take the subway to the Dongnimmun station on the orange line. Leave through exit 5 and when you come to street level you can see the wall of the prison and easily follow signs to the entrance. The exhibits were interesting and moving. Most of the placards are in several languages, including English, so it's easy to follow along. I was disappointed that one of the prison halls with stories of individual prisoners only had information in Korean but there was plenty to see otherwise. If you're unfamiliar with the Japanese occupation of Korea I recommend doing a little reading about it before your visit. I had just finished reading ""The Living Reed"" by Pearl S. Buck and it made my visit there so much more meaningful. I also recommend following the route in the pamphlet they give you to completion. Some of the most interesting and moving exhibits were at the end.I had the same unfortunate experience with loud groups of school children (there were at least 3 large groups there) as another reviewer. Trying to experience a museum while large groups are moving through at the same time is not something I enjoy. However, I had started the museum around 1pm which is a common time for field trips to arrive. After the exhibits in the central building I took a break outside and sat in the shade for a bit. Walking around after 2pm was much easier. Some of the groups had left and the remaining ones had spread out. So if you find yourself bothered by large groups I suggest just waiting a bit.", October 2018
24,5.0,Absolute must visit!,"I can't believe how amazing this museum is, absolutely chilling and surreal. It's so important to intake in the history of the country you are visiting and I had an unforgettable experience. I also had a local with me as some parts are in Korean and he was able to read and explain it to me.  However be warned this can be a very emotional experience.", October 2018
25,5.0,Like a Korean version of jewish memorial,"A place which reminds South Koreans of the brutal colonial rule of Japan. A nice place to see what Koreans suffered before earning their independence. A place to show respect. People are free to take photos, but it is important to remember that people died of torture here.", October 2018
26,4.0,"3.5 stars, Interesting place to learn how Koreans suffered under the Japanese",I have been to a few prisons and this one was pretty interesting although I would have liked to see more displays about how the prisoners lived. More models and displays would be good although there were a few. Walking around the prison and imagining the painful history was interesting. There is also good hiking nearby and I would recommend going hiking early in the morning and then visiting the prison afterwards (especially in summer)., August 2018
27,5.0,Such pain and suffering,"This prison history hall wasn't on our radar for our first visit to Seoul but for our second trip I was looking for something a little different, to discover more of the history of Seoul, and we certainly got it here.  Seodaemun Prison operated from 1908 to 1987, in 1988 it was designated National Historic Relic No.324, then in 1998 the History Hall was opened. The Prison History Hall is located in Seodaemun-gu, easily to accessed by Subway Line 3, Dongnimmun Station, from here it is a short walk.  Our self-guided tour prison history hall complex cost 3000 won each and lasted 1.25 hours using the brochure that we were given at the ticket office.  There was plenty of the information to read (Korean and English text), the displays were excellent and conveyed the significance and at times were quite emotional. The torture chamber was the most alarming with descriptions of the variety of tortures conducted on prisoners, at times with sound effects.  On the day of our visit the museum was well attended by nationals, young and old, and families. A very interesting morning.", April 2018
28,4.0,Interesting Place,"We have been to many prisons around the world, and this one had its own unique way to memorialize its prisoners.  Instead of death masks or head molds we have seen elsewhere (of newly executed prisoners), here we saw many molds of prisoners’ feet.  These were presented on individual prisoner plaques, with a three-dimensional view of the bottoms of their feet.", January 2018
29,1.0,Overrun by Poorly Behaved Children,"I was really excited about seeing this. As we walked around, there were no less than 50 groups of children (likely on field trips from school). The children were running around, screaming, and in my opinion, being completely disrespectful in an area where many people died so that they could have freedom. Their teachers largely ignored the behavior, and used microphones with speakers to talk to the children creating such a loud a chaotic environment that we could not possibly concentrate on the tour. The reason why I give it one star is because even though there were signs all over asking for people to be quiet and there were staff members in every room, I didn't see  single staff member as the children or teachers to abide by the signs and be quiet. We left with headaches, shame :(", April 2018
30,5.0,So sad what people can do to each other,This was another find by accident. We spent a full day here and had a day of sadness & amazement of the human spirit. The people were so badly treated but seem to still keep their spirit and pride., April 2018
31,5.0,A MUST!,"You may need to toughtlen up a little bit when you come here, but overall, it's a very good experience when you want to learn about Korea. However, there are some texts without English :( Despite that, I still enjoyed my time here. There are only few tourists around. Most people who were there when I came were students and those who are in their mandatory military training. So if you want to stay off the touristy track, do come to this place. Admission is only 3,000₩. :)", April 2018
32,5.0,A Surprise,"We originally decided to visit here to fill in time, and so glad we did. The whole site has been refurbished and takes at least an hour to complete the route they suggest. Very good displays and explanations in English for us. As you walk around you could imagine what it would have been like for the prisoners under Japanese rule. Usually places like this only keep 1 or 2 buildings as a museum and destroy the rest but here you get to view basically the full occupied site.", March 2018

Womens underground prison was interesting and the details that keep the memory of the suffering alive are interesting. Not the best English translations, but you get the general idea in the selection of exhibits and information on display. The metal die casts of feet; photography images and small artifacts paint a sad picture of the unsettled time in Korean history. We visited while half the place was out of bounds due to a festival rehearsal, but the stunning voices of the opera singers throughout the dreary halls of prison cells seemed fitting somehow and made the experience better! Subway station directly at the main gate; basic toilet facilities and a small souvenir shop. Not the best museum in the city but definitely worth a visit.", November 2017

If you only have time for one museum I would go to the war museum but if you have time then definitely come here.", August 2017
39,4.0,History!! With a caveat...,"This should be a top attraction in Korea. The prison is actually a museum, that depicts not only the facilities of the prison and the atrocities perpetrated in it, with graphic pictures and, mostly, reconstruction of tortures with dummies, but also tells us the history of Korea's occupation by Japan (1910-1945). It is well organized and therefore easy to follow. Not everything is also in English but most of it is. The caveat is that I found it a little biased. It focuses strongly on the Japanese era and clearly is a strong criticism to that, which is OK. However, there is nothing about the period 1945-1987, during which the prison was run by Korea, after their freedom from Japanese occupation.", August 2017
40,4.0,"Interesting, but...","The exhibits are well presented and many have English descriptions. Also, the route is well marked, so it is easy to follow. Visited during a school vacation, so there were groups of children visiting. They were quite noisy despite many signs with 'be quiet' (in English and Korean), but the museum workers did not seem to care. Seemed a bit inappropriate in a place like this. To be fair, this becomes less of a problem once you get out of the main exhibit building.Also, the presentation seems a bit one-sided, as it focuses strongly on the Japanese occupation and the crimes committed during this period. For example, some (more 'neutral') exhibits have only Korean descriptions, but most about particularly bad torture or mistreatment of inmates also have descriptions in English, Chinese and (of course) Japanese. No-one can deny that the occupation was terrible, but the facility was also used as a prison by Korean governments until 1987. Little information is given about the 40+ years after WW2. Still, very educational and well worth a visit.", July 2017

51,5.0,A Great History Lesson For All,"This former prison and history hall shows what lead up to the Japanese occupation in Korea in 1910 and what happened after that. It's a very sad history but will make you thankful for the blessings that you have. You'll see where prisoners, who fought against the Japanese soldiers were tortured, put into prison, biographies of male and female prisoners, and pictures of the people that died there. It's a sad reminder of how evil war can be.You can visit this place within an hour to an hour and a half. It's closed on Mondays (if a holiday falls on Monday then it's open on the holiday but closed on Tuesday). The hours are from 9:30-6:00pm from March to October and 9:30-5:00pm from November to February. The cost is ₩3,000 for adults, ₩1,500 for youth between 13-18, and ₩1,000 for children between 7-12. However I wouldn't recommend bringing young children here. It's located at Dongnimmun Station (Line 3), Exit 5.", January 2017
52,4.0,Displays some of the ugly past of Japanese rule in Korea.,"Seodaemun Prison is well worth a visit to get a perspective of the Japanese treatment of Koreans during the occupation (1895-1945). Very interesting factual information and models give you a real life perspective of what it was like and how prisoners were treated. The wall of prisoner photographs brings you to the stark reality that young or old, you could find yourself imprisoned here - or worse....", October 2016
53,4.0,Prison,"Right by Dongnimmun St. Exit 5. Entrnace fee is 3,000 KRW. There is a small gift shop with good souvenirs from the place. Two floors. Good piece of history", December 2016

55,4.0,"scary place, to get a feeling of the japanese occupation period","dont expect lots of artefact, this prison is  standing to remind every Koreans that not so long ago Japanese came and tried to exterminate their freedom. If you are not Japanese, you should go and pay respect. visit the adjacent building where people were put to death (hanging) and realize how much different Korea has become today.", January 2016
56,5.0,A dark page in the Korean history,"Unlike other reviews I felt a little disappointed with the availability of English translations (about 2/3rd of all signs) or English subtitles on videos (only 1 out of 4/5) as without a guide I'd like to read everything to get a good understanding of what's on display. Nonetheless gives the museum a good impression of the horrible time during Japanese suppression. Spent about 2,5 hours. Entrance fee is comparable to other museums, couple of Euros per person.", October 2016
57,4.0,Worth a visit - educational and mostly in English,"I found this a very educational visit as I knew little of the Japanese rule over Korea. Most of the information was in English - not everything, but definitely enough to make this place a worthwhile place to visit. The park next door is a nice place to wander through too.", October 2016
58,5.0,Must visit when in Seoul,The prison is in a little memorial parc that is definitely worth visiting.  There are free guided tours done by students who want to learn english - so not a professional tour but quite good.  The visit is well organised and everything is in both Korean and English.  It's quite sad to see everything that happened in Korea and to all of those men and women who only wanted freedom.  You won't leave that place unaffected and it'll make you realise that freedom should never be taken for granted.  Amazing place.  It'll take you a few hours to visit the whole prison., July 2016
59,4.0,"Eerie, but Interesting ","Came here upon recommendation by a friend, and it didn't disappoint. It was a wonderful learning visit, but a little heart wrenching at some point. Definitely a place for history lovers. Spent about 2hours here, after reading all the English descriptions that was available; some exhibits didn't. The site was easy to find from Dongnimmun station. After paying 3000won for the entry, I was free to explore the grounds. The first block was a kind of a introductory exhibit where the history of the prison was introduced. There were many blocks on the ground. However, there was a certain flow indicated to tell you which block to go to next everytime you exited one. It felt like I was moving through a story, and it helped me to not miss out any exhibits.I happened to visit on the day when many schools trips were taking place. Groups and groups of students were all over. It got a tad annoying because they were noisy (didn't help when I was trying to have a moment of silence). But, their noise and chattering was appreciated I was walking through the eerie torture chamber and execution house. Those places sent chills down my spine, and good thing there was laughter around to lighten the mood a little.", September 2016
60,5.0,Great place for history,"We quite like these sorts of things when travelling, and this one didn't disappoint!Although it was quite emotional to see what the Koreans went through under Japanese rule. But was definitely an eye opener.", September 2016
61,5.0,Interesting place and a little eeiry,This is a museum of Korean life under Japanese occupation. There are lots to see and well worth a visit. Use line 3 and short walk from the station., August 2016
62,4.0,Korean History Lesson,"We went on a tour with an english speaking guide which made it much more interesting. Some of the signs are in english, but not all.This prison was used during the Japanese occupation and then after independence it was used as a regular prison until just before the Olympics (1987).  You certainly hear a lot about the brutality of the Japanese during this time and they spirit of the Koreans who fought against it.  It is certainly horrible to see how people were kept in tiny cramped cells and the torture they endured, just because they wanted their country to be free.  We didn't hear so much about how the prison was operated after the Japanese left or what sort of people were kept there.Much of the prison has been rebuilt as a memorial for future generations.It is in a very nice park at the foot of a Mountain.  It is easily accessible from/right next to, Dongnimmum metro station and costs about W3000 to get in. Only for those with a particular interest in such things.", August 2016
63,4.0,Political History Tour,"A very interesting museum that takes a visitor from the colonial period through the 1980s. The story of Korean nationalism plays out through the displays. While there is little regarding the prison's use during the period following liberation, I was pleased to at least see some acknowledgment of the abuses suffered at that time by reformers. While the preponderance of the displays are in Korean only (this is Korea, after all), there are still enough English languages boards to inform the English-speaking visitor. This is a well done museum and a recommended stop for a visitor to Seoul - especially one who wants to understand the still-strained relationship with Japan and the emergent Korean nationalism that was torn apart in the Korean War.", August 2016
64,3.0,Quick tour enough,First reaction better than last. I wouldn't do this over other attractions. It's light on English details and very recreated v authentic. Good quick history lesson., August 2016
65,5.0,Insight of history,"Amazing complex not far from the city center that tells a lot of the hardship korea had to face while under japanese occupation.Shocking to see what humans are able to do to each other,but thru this hopefully we are able to learn.After all it is a prison,and it gives a feeling of sadness but also in a good sense.", July 2016
66,5.0,Informative Yet Fun,"We visited this early in the morning with at least two school groups.  The prison was well preserved and all the placards had very good English explanations.  It took us about 2 hours to walk through.  I found it a sad history and interesting insight into the way the Japanese attempted to suppress the spirit of the Korean people.  The school groups were fun to watch as the engaged with the various exhibits.  Go, it helps to tie the occupational history to the Korean War and see the beginnings of separate states.", June 2016
67,4.0,Good place to learn some history,Very nice place considering the genre. We were met by a volunteer tour guide who spoke excellent English and was very up on the history of the prison. It was a good place to spend the day learning a little history., July 2016
68,5.0,Eerie and intriguing ,"This place most certainly reached my expectations.The entrance to Seodaemun Prison Hall starts off with some background information. The entire area itself is large with several of buildings to visit. After the entrance building is where all the creepiness begins. I felt myself shiver as I walked through the other buildings. I recall seeing an entire row of cells and the silence adds up to the creepiness. There's also a hospital, memorial hall, and work out area that was all part of the history. There were also hand prints and image of each of the deceased. Along with feeling scared, was also a wave of sadness. You get to read personal notes written by those held captive which truly gives you an insight of the horrors. There are some small clips that briefly summarize the horrors. I absolutely loved this place. It's like watching an incredible historical bloody movie. Scary but intriguing. Not recommended to those with the faintest heart.", July 2016
69,3.0,Specially interested if you are into WWII stuff,"I guess it is a must for people that are into WWII stuff and history. It is well preserved, depicting specially the struggles of the more than 3,000 ""martyrs"" imprisioned there during the Japanese occupation of Korea, from 1910 to 1935. There is a whole section of the prison where the instruments of tortured are showed, plus testimonies, pictures, etc. Although you can follow in English, pretty much, there is a lot of stuff in Korean that it is not translated. Pretty shocking and graphic, make the actual American debate about ""water boarding"" a joke. It is not for everybody. I won't recommend it unless there is a specific interest.", June 2016
70,3.0,Somewhat one-sided,"The prison and grounds are kept in good condition. The red brick buildings are somewhat unique here in Korea, so I enjoyed looking around them. The prison has been restored to the point that it's almost hard to imagine it as a place of torture and despair. They have recreations of various torture methods used. You can see the exercise grounds where prisoners were separated by walls while exercising, the execution room, and the secret tunnel used to carry bodies out. I am not giving this a better review for two reasons: while many signs were in English and in Korean, there were enough signs that were only in Korean that I felt like I was missing out on some really interesting stories. The other, and more important reason, is that it is so one-sided that it feels like a nostalgic, naive look back on Korean patriots rather than an objective history museum. While that nostalgia doesn't need to be completely eliminated, it should have been much more balanced. I would have liked to have heard about the Japanese guards and their lives, during and after. I really think they should have talked more about the prison after the Japanese occupation more. Who were the prisoners under the newly formed Korean government and how were they treated then? Was it similar to how the Japanese treated prisoners? I know the new Korean government had a massive crackdown on dissidents, but they are barely mentioned. If you are interested in prisons or the Japanese occupation, I would still recommend this because it is a unique look into an important part of Korean history.", May 2016
71,5.0,A must see for Korean history.,Our visit to the prison was one of the most humbling experiences we had. The prison was used for political dissidents under Japanese rule and visiting the museum revealed the depths of human nature.I maybe wouldn't recommend going with children that are really young as some things can be quite could be upsetting. But for anyone who is interested in Japanese/Korean history this is a must see.The museum is one of the most interesting we have visited. It is rare that I find myself reading every display in a museum but I did at Seodaemun Prison., April 2016
72,5.0,Wonderfu tour guide here.,"We really enjoyed our tour here, led by a young volunteer that spoke excellent english.  A must see place in Seoul for those who are history minded.", April 2016
73,5.0,Great history lesson ,"Trying to fill my time I came across this location in my guide book and it was worth the visit. For 3,000 won you get to walk around this huge prison museum and see the suffering Koreans endured during Japanese occupation. You may need 1.5 hours to tour this huge place. Great visuals with pictures and recreations of torturous methods used on prisoners.", April 2016
74,5.0,A must visit when in Seoul to understand its past and present,"The halls, the cells, the buildings, the stories and the displays will open your eyes to a dark period of Korean history but rather than focusing on the gruesomeness of the events that took place here, take a moment to reflect and understand the struggle for Korean Independence, the pride Koreans have for their country. It's a solemn place so place be respectful. keep quiet and use this visit to learn more and understand Korea better.", May 2015
75,4.0,Step Back Into Korean History,"Very well maintained, a lot of nice artifacts and displays.  Very friendly workers.  A nice place to visit to learn more about a different somewhat tilted side of Korean history.  Only drawback too much emphasis on how great and how hard the righteous Korean people fought off the yoke of Japanese occupation.  Nothing mentioned about the United States defeating the Japanese for Korea to regain its independence, or how many Koreans were snitches and spies who worked for the Japanese Kempeitai.  Nothing mentioned about how many teenagers President Park Chung Hee imprisoned there when he was president for tearing down a political poster and beaten to confess that it was his father’s idea (my father-in-law) to do that like what happened to my brother-in-law in 1971.  Overall a very nice day trip in conjunction with a walk down to Independence Park.", March 2016
76,4.0,Creepy and Necessary,I wandered to the prison one day when I had a few hours to spare. It was a hard to face reality of the Japanese occupation. But it is part of the history and I did see many young families there. There were wax figures in the torture section that may be scary to young children. (It can be bypassed since the walk is self guided). There is a replica of the prison exercise yard and several of the cell blocks. Not much in English - but really not needed., March 2016
77,4.0,Interesting,To be done your last day in Seoul. Shows how corean prisoners were treated by the Japanese. Edifying., February 2016
78,4.0,Insight into a less well know piece of Korean history.,"This is an interesting prison well layed out and easy to get to on the metro, Dongnimmun station. Located close to other major sights it is worth a visit if you like history and only takes a couple of hours. Not all the information is in English but most is. The museum covers the time of the Japanese occupation and includes a section on torture, so emotive but presented in a informative way.", February 2016
79,4.0,An interesting piece of history,"Old prison from the Japanese colonial era turned into a museum. There is a lot of information, signage also available in English. There is also a large portion of the outside grounds available to walk around and see. Even though I went on a weekend, it wasn't very crowded as it isn't a top tourist attraction, though I do suggest a visit here to see a different side of Seoul and it's history. The whole complex can easily be seen in little more than one hour. Photos are allowed.", January 2015
80,3.0,"Decent museum, but it's no Alcatraz","Interesting landmark in Seoul; I think it would clearer if they changed the name to the Korean Patriot History Hall because that is what the museum truly focuses on. If you are expecting an Alcatraz-type tour, you will be disappointed.", October 2015
81,5.0,Worth a visit,Sobering reminder of the struggle that this county endured for its independence.  Amazing juxtaposition in looking at the grounds of the prison yard with the skyscrapers and apartment complexes nearby., October 2015
82,4.0,Good Day Trip if you like history/cultural measumes,Glad we went to get to see the culture and history. The hall had a lot of different buildings to walk around and get different perspectives from different stories. Very informative and interactive., May 2015
83,4.0,Feel like a prisoner,"My trip to Korea doesn’t stop at garden, villages and good food. I took a detour to a prison in Seoul. This is Seodaemun prison, among the largest prison in Seoul in the past era, when South Korea is still under Japanese colonization. You can’t get too excited on the main gates. It has a watch tower, lovely red bricks wall and a metal. That is about it. Let’s go in, I am sure there are “nostalgic” stuff within. Visitors are immediately greeted with some of the tools used for locking up prisoners. The next section bring us to some interrogation chamber, torture chambers where we witness how Japanese forcing the prisoners or detainee to admit wrong-doing that they didn’t commit. I move on to visit the actual cell where prisoners kept. The classic scary element is there - long aisle, dim interior, and the metal clanking noise upon door swinging open. Many people died here. The atmosphere may be calm and peace, but we are constantly reminded of the remaining lingering soul and ghost.", July 2015
84,4.0,Worth a visit,Interesting place. Easy to walk around in a couple of hours. Tells a very interesting story of the effects of the Japanese rule. I would have liked to hear the eye witness accounts from the prisoners but they were only available in Korean. Interesting explanations of some of the things the Japanese did to ensure they maintained absolute control over the   Korean prisoners., September 2015
85,3.0,Interesting but not all that impressive,"Seodaemun Prison is a unique attraction amongst all the towers, temples, museums or palaces you might have the opportunity to visit in Korea. It's definitely worth visiting. The surrounding Seodeamun Independence Park (with its statues, grass paths, pools) is also nice and the prison sits it very nicely. The prison is a great yet troubling and horrifying way to learn about Korea's complex history. However, keep in mind that visiting the prison doesn't take more than an hour. And while many museums in Korea are foreigner-friendly, with a lot of explanations in English, the prison overall lacks context. This is especially regrettable because for people who might not be well familiar with the Japanese occupation of Korea, they might miss on what this museum trully means and represents. Finally, while most major museums in Korea are free, the prison, while also public, costs 3000 KRW to visit. Not expensive, but still surprising that you have to pay more to visit this than the National Museum of Korea for example...", September 2015
86,4.0,"This is the nicest prison you'll ever visit, but will leave feeling terrible...","The Seodaemun Prison History Hall is an epic monument that clearly shows the evil nature of the Japanese captors because there are dozens of torture chambers and methods that were used against Koreans. Yes, the Japanese did much worse when they burned down Royal Palaces and tried to erase Korean History, but nothing remains from those atrocities. Here, for example, you can see or actually step into these horrific caskets used for psychological torture. There are many other examples of how Koreans were enslaved in this museum. It's so real, you'll feel it. One of the better remnants that tells the truth of history through meticulous preservation. Plz go if you have the time...", October 2014
87,4.0,Interesting and informative,A well-maintained and informative place to learn a bit about one aspect of Korea's history. Quite a large compound which took around 1-2 hours to explore and even had a free digital photo booth for you to use as a souvenir., December 2014
88,3.0,Interesting Spot,"I am glad that I took the time to visit this spot. It's not on my top 10 list of things to see in Seoul, but it did help me to gain some insight into the animosity between South Korea and Japan.", August 2015
89,4.0,Historic,This place was used to be a prison when Korea was under the Japanese administration. It shows cruelty of Japanese and you can feel the spirit of the old Korean people who worked for the independence., January 2015
90,4.0,A Gem of a Place,"Off the beaten path (and less busy) compared to some of the main attractions but it's a gem of a place. This place should be ranked higher on the list of attractions in Seoul. It's a very moving place with a lot of great information about Japan's occupation of Korea and there are bunch of buildings to look through. Random Information:Cost was 3,000won for 1 adult.Plan to spend 1-2 hours here.There were vending machines with drinks available.Small gift shop at the end of your self-guided tour.One of the lesser busy places to visit on the weekend.", June 2015
91,5.0,A blatant reminder......,I found the whole museum to be a fascinating place to visit. The reminders of the Japanese occupation of Korea and the cruelty inflicted upon the Korean people were blatant and graphic. Also the era of Korean history where despotic military leaders imprisoned anyone who spoke out against the regime. The prison museum is in tact and provides a chilling reminder of life behind bars right up to 1987., July 2015
92,5.0,Very moving,"This attraction is a must-do for anyone interested in history. There is not a lot of information provided in English in the museum, but the story of the torture and imprisonment which took place here is made clear. The basement of the museum building is where the actual torture took place - seeing the life-sized figures in the cells and hearing the soundtrack of someone screaming gave me goosebumps! The little hut where those found guilty were executed is also very poignant. The cell block and exercise yards are the other points of interest. The prison is a bit out of the way, but a really interesting and moving place to visit if you get a chance.", July 2015

95,4.0,A Piece of Korean History in the Middle of Seoul,"I visited this attraction because I am a huge history buff. The prison was built in the early 20th century and it gives an idea of what life was like for prisoners during Korea's colonial period. You can walk the grounds, and you can step foot inside the cells. There are mannequins depicting the horrible atrocities committed against the prisoners. There is even an opportunity to stand inside one of the Korean torture devices, which is a cubby hole (read: small closet) without any extra room. If you are over five feet, nine inches tall you are going to be extremely uncomfortable in this thing! And we read that some prisoners were left in there for days!We hired a tour guide who spoke excellent English. He walked us through the various buildings and rooms. He explained what life was like for the prisoners back when the facilities were in operation.Seoul is an exciting and bustling city. The streets  along the main thoroughfares are clean and the infrastructure can handle the population's mobility. Visiting this ancient prison was like stepping into a time warp. You certainly got a feel for a time that has since passed.I would recommend this attraction. You only need to spend two hours there, at the most. But be sure to get a guide. The memories will last forever.", June 2015
96,3.0,Seodaemun Prison History Hall,"An interesting museum that used to be a prison during the japanese occupation. It's right in front of dongnimun station and next to a big park.

Bring  a drink. watch your head when you go to lower levels.", September 2014
97,5.0,Favorite historical site in Seoul,"The prison hall museum offered a moving view of the deep struggles of those who fought for freedom.

103,5.0,A painful history which can be felt,When I went to this old prison with one of my Korean friends it really touch me in my seoul. The brutality of the guards but also the pain and perseverance of the prisoners. It was amazing to see and feel that. This prison is part of the history and will remain that.

The torture, the beatings, the hardship, the desperation and isolation of the exercise yard and the solitary confinement. It's all here.

Please go. You won't regret it.", December 2014
106,4.0,Needs More English,"I'm a prison museum junkie, so I wouldn't say this is a fair review. I loved it here, even though a friend said it was for kids.

There are four main buildings, all well-worth the walk through. The emphasis here avoids bitterness and revenge and stresses education and forward-looking. It is easily accessible via subway. It has nice amenities, including clean restrooms, refreshments, and a nice gift shop. well worth a visit.", August 2014
108,5.0,Amazing and humbling at the same time,"A fantastic insight to what it was like when Japan colonized and how they went about to eradicate the language, education, and culture of Korea. So sad, but we see how a young college girl becomes a martyr for her country. The daily life of the prison reminds of the Civil War POW prisons in the US. This single sight is forever etched in my memory to portray the struggles of Koreans under Japanese rule.", October 2013
109,5.0,A bit of History I never knew about,This place was one of the last places I visited on my trip to Korea and it was by far one of the best sites to see only costing 3 wons (3 dollars). I arrived early so not too many people were there and it made it so much more interesting to feel the emptyness of those cell blocks. All the exhibits were translated to english so it was informative as well as educational., August 2014
110,5.0,A Sad Piece of History,Truly a moving experience. This is a definite must see to witness the atrocities and capabilities of mankind.

Disturbing at times, but always moving, the museum compares itself to other memorials to human suffering such as Auschwitz and the Anne Frank house in Amsterdam. As long as you're interested in history, you can easily spend a couple hours touring the grounds and exhibits. I would be careful about bringing small children, though. Some of the exhibits include instruments of torture. And one of the restored jail cells has an audio recording of a prisoner pleading to be let out.", April 2014

114,4.0,Important in Understanding Korean History,"Seodaemun Prison is an important place to visit while in Seoul as it explains the complicated relationship between Japan and Korea.  At the beginning of the 20th century, Japan occupied Korea bringing with it great oppression while forcing the people to take on Japanese customs.  Of course, this was met with a lot of resistance.  Because of this, many Koreans were taken to Seodaemun for questioning and were tortured by the Japanese, the most famous Ryu Gwan-sun.Many of the factory buildings are gone, but the museum’s main buildings still include some cells that housed prisoners, torture chambers, and many exhibits explaining this time in history.  I think the most powerful part of Seodaemun Prison was the room which included hundreds of photos of people who had been imprisoned there.  It was pretty powerful to see the faces of the people who would try to hold onto their country at any cost, including death.This museum may not be for everyone especially if you are not into history, but for 3,000 won and the chance to learn a little more about the history of modern Korea made it worth it for me.Be warned, many of the displays are in Korean only which may be frustrating to some.  Also, during the week, there are a lot of school groups making it cumbersome to navigate through large groups of children at times, but in the end, it was still worth it as it's a very powerful museum.", April 2014
115,4.0,Interesting place to go.,"This is the first prison museum I've visited. The atmosphere is very sombre and there is quite a lot to see and learn. It actually made me feel quite sad visiting this place knowing so many people suffered and died here. They have cells you can go in and some torture devices and you can kind of imagine what it was like for prisoners back then, horrible. They have a memorial hall where they have thousands of pictures of the prisoners... very heavy and sad place.... I wouldn't go again, but it was a good experience. I think I went on a weekday and it wasnt too crowded but still a few too many kids than I would have liked :PAnyway, good visit, probably about 2 hours. Also the surrounding are is nice for a walk too.", May 2014
116,4.0,"Gloomy and depressing, but go if you love history","The second prison museum I've visited (the first being Alcatraz in San Francisco), one thing is the same - the gloomy and depressing feeling as I walked through the halls. The rainy weather probably made it even lonelier. The museum is well-preserved, and not that crowded on a weekday. You can slowly enjoy reading all the exhibits without anyone disturbing.All in all, I'll recommend this museum if you want to find out more about the history of the Independence Movement. It's a quiet place to do some self-reflection and thinking. For more photos, http://travellerelf.blogspot.sg/2014/03/korean-culture-history-seodaemun-prison.html", July 2013
117,4.0,Painful side of recent Korean history.,"Even though the prison was used after the Japanese occupation ended, the displays mainly focus on the harsh treatment Koreans suffered under Japanese rule. As a result it has an anti Japanese vibe, but I'm not sure how you could tell the story in a way that honors the thousands of Koreans who died without sounding a little anti Japanese.The prison is right next to Dongnimmun Station on subway line 3 which makes it really easy to get to. Today, only a fraction of the original prison complex remains standing, but you can still see the workshop, some of the cells, the execution room, the torture rooms in the basement, the walls and the watch towers. lots of pictures and more info on my blog here http://gdaykorea.blogspot.kr/2014/05/seodaemun-prison-history-museum-old-seoul-prison.html", May 2014
118,5.0,"This is disturbing, but an important place to see","One wouldn't call this place fun, by any means, but they have done a wonderful job of portraying the brutality of such prisons and of describing a painful part of Korea's history.  It's easy to move around here, there are lots of open spaces between buildings, and it's right on the subway line.  People interested in history, and in Korean history in particular, should definitely take the time to visit this important site.", February 2014
119,4.0,Worth the trip,"It is no auschwitz take of that what you will, but it still a stark reality and a peice of history that most people do not visit. The presentation and the history lit before the actual buildings are Korean heavy, so recommended to have someone with you for translations, I was lucky enough to have someone with me who spoke Korean, but what we did find that the translations omitted certain things in either the English or Korean, so be wary of the translations that are presented for you. Overall a must see as it helps really make you realize how much S.Korea has changed in such a short time.", October 2013
120,5.0,Educational and Interesting.,This museum highlights a part of Korean history that some may choose to forget. You can tour the actual rooms where they tortured prisoners. This can be very disturbing but it is also educational as you cannot forget what happened to these people. You cannot imagine living in such a place and going through what these people did. This museum is a bit far from the city center but we got there by subway and then walked so make sure you have good directions., May 2013
121,5.0,Very thought provoking museum,I'm not usually that impressed with museums but visiting Seodaemun Prison History Hall ended up being one of the highlights of our time in Seoul. It's design is very visitor friendly and the information is presented in various interesting ways. I found the visit very thought provoking and it gave me a much better understanding of Korea's difficult history., September 2013
122,4.0,Interesting and provoking,"This a prison built during the Japanese occupation in 1907 to house political prisoners, men, women and even juveniles arrested for resisting Japan's colonial occupation. After the liberation of 1945 it continued to house prisoners until it was finally closed in 1987.  Since much of it was dismantled before being turned into a history museum, some of it has actually been rebuilt. The main prison hall, workshops, and execution building however are the intact original, and stand as an eerie reminder of Korea's unfortunate history. The museum displays instruments of torture, photographs taken of prisoners, and you can enter solitary confinement cells to get a glimpse of how harrowing it must have been for those who suffered. LCD screens give eye witness accounts from actual survivors. Elderly men and women still bearing physical and emotional scars, describe the brutality they endured as prisoners. Although the narrative is soaked in Korean nationalism, the overriding theme is that the museum should serve as a reminder of the sacrifices made by independence activists, and it does. The tour takes about 2 hours. If poignant and sombre history is something you like to take in, then it is worthwhile. It only costs a few dollars, and afterwards you can take short taxi or bus ride to Shinchon, where you can find great places to eat, street food, arty cafes and shopping.", January 2014
123,4.0,"A meaningful experience. 
Something beyond the usual shopping, eating, sight-seeing...","So you have done the shopping in Myeongdong, that trip down to Gangnam (oppa, gangnam style! Though I know that is so ""last year"" right?). Taken pictures at Gyeongbokgung Palace, bought your breakfast pastries and rolls from Paris Baguetten or Tous le jour, bought souvenirs at Insadong, peered into North Korea from the demilitarised zone (DMZ) at Paju, what else is there to do in Seoul? If you have time to spare, take a look at Dongnimmun Gate (independence gate) and visit the Seodaemun Prison History Hall. Given years of Chinese hegemony, period of Japanese Occupation and the experience of the Korean War, Koreans are extremely patriotic (or nationalistic). See this sprit of the Korean people represented in history at the Seodaemun Prison Hall, which was one prison that housed activists of the Korean Independence Movement against Japanese occupation. Getting there: It is located near Dongnimmun (独立门- which is independence gate in Engliah) subway station on Line 3. It's on the same line as Gyeongbokgung and Anguk (where you would alight if you were going to Insadong). We had lunch at Insadong first before heading to Seodaemun Prison. 1. Alight at Dongnimmun Station (subway line 3 - orange)2. Get out fromexit 5. 3. As soon as you are at street level, look to your left. You should see a pathway leading to a brick complex. 4. Follow the pathway to the main entrance. Ticket price:1. 3000 won (1 adult) Opening hours: 1. 0930-1800 (March to October) 2. 0930 - 1700 (November to February) We spent about 2 hours at the museum. A friend lecturing at Seoul National University had brought his students there numerous times and he does not want to be there once the sun starts to set..... Other information: The Prison Hall consists of several complexes, some of which have been demolished. A good part of the original prison structures still remain and those have been converted to a museum honoring those who sacrificed during Korea's struggle for independence. The old official documents are written in Hanja (Chinese characters), Japanese or Korean. Hence for visitors whose first language is English, you might not be able to read the documents. The exhibits are introduced in English, Korean, Japanese and sometimes Chinese so one should not have much problems reading about the history of the museum, the experience of the prisoners, the torture methods, etc. TLDR: A very enriching experience that offers a glimpses into Korea's tumultuous past and a representation of the spirit of struggle in Korean's independence movement.", December 2013
124,3.0,"Its good, but all in Korean","Its an interesting museum, but 90-95% of the writing to explain stuff is in Korean. Walking here is interesting but with the lack of any explanation it is hard to understand what is what.When I went there was a school trip which consisted of kids that looked the age of 8 going to a prison museum, an interesting school trip I do say. From what you can understand, it shows what the prisoners went through during their time.", November 2013
125,4.0,Humbling and Educational,"This prison is right off the 3 Subway Line.  You take Exit 5 and walk right up to it.The day we were here there were many school children also touring the facility.  There was a small fee to get in, but I don't remember exactly how much. We were able to do a self tour and most of the museum is in English.  I've been to Alcatraz and the Eastern State Penitentiary in the USA.  These looked very similar...until you get to the torture part.  So Sad.  Then the memorial wall of photos of all those children killed for being Independence Fighters.  This was very educational as I feel like I didn't learn much about Asian history in the States.  The part of the museum that was most moving was the installation called ""Independence Fighters and Me"".  This is a small room with mirrored walls.  Pictures of Independence Fighters are on wall....along with yourself.  Such a moving piece.", October 2013
126,4.0,Funny place to visit... great for photos,"I stumbled upon this place by reading an article about Seodaemun, one of the former eight gates of Seoul. Instead of finding a gate, the searches led me to the Seodaemun Independence Park with Seodaemun Prison as its signature attraction. Instad of going alone, I invited friends who wanted a “Seoul Tour”.Getting there from Nambu Bus Terminal is very simple, and finding the entrance to the prison is very easy. Asking someone, “hey do want to go to prison with me” was the most difficult part until I explained the details of the journey. The prison hasn’t been actively used as it’s original function for a few decades and serves as a very interesting museum. After purchasing a ticket,  we were guided to the first exhibit hall that explains the history and gruesome details of the various functions this place has served as besides being a Korean jail. There are guides who speak English that will explain everything for you. The first building has both upper and lower levels you need to see.Inside the first building on the upper level, there are art exhibits with pictures of the prisoners (both men and women), videos and other historical items (shackles, documents) present. The basement area has the more graphic scenes. We walked through what the interrogation rooms and cells looked like. We got to peek through and catch glimpses of wax figures depicting scenes of what happened in each room. Further into the basement is the hotbox and solitary confinement cells in which we were able to cram ourselves into. We shackled up with props provided and took a lot of funny pictures with other vistors.There is also another building representing a large area of cells. It starts with a processing room and leads further down a long hallway. Some rooms are locked in with wax figures and others are open. We locked ourselves in a few for fun to see what it was like (since we aren’t criminals).Afterwards, there is a large courtyard for the kids to run around in conjunction with Independence Park. We decided to head back to Myeongdong for lunch. There are many other features located in the area, like one of many entrances to the nearby hiking trail, but we were too hungry.To get to this area from Nambu Bus Terminal or any place in Seoul, connect to the #3 subway line heading for Daehwa. Get off at Dongnimun station (326). Leave the station from exit 5 and there will be a sign for Seodaemun Prison in with 10 meters of the exit. Follow the signs up the narrow path up the hill to the main entrance. The cost is 3,000 won for adults and 1,500-2,000 won for kids (sorry, I don’t have any).", October 2013
127,4.0,A Stirring Memorial,"Visiting here you will see many school children visiting this facility. It is quite a somber experience much like going to the Pearl Harbor Arizona memorial, a bit depressing because this prison is hwere the Japanese housed political prisoners during its occupation of Korea.   but history holds pleasant and difficult memories. This is one of the somber ones. But once you visit here you can hike your boots off by heading uphill to find the remaining route of the wall around Seoul liking up with the Bukhansan national Park route - that was a tremendous full day hike around the outskirts of Seoul.", October 2012
128,5.0,Chilling prison complex,"Never being in trouble with the law, visiting a prison is always a thing of novelty, a cool and fun thing to with friends.Once inside we are guided in a series of displays explaining various chapters about the prison itself. Its construction, expansion and recent shutdown. Dispersed in various building of the complex we soon get to see the real prison wards, the old facilities where people got locked in, get questioned and even tortured. In the outdoor areas we get to see the deathrow housing and the nowayback tunnel beside of it... Chilling! All in all, this museum shows the cruel reality on this particular prison in it's different eras and managements where koreans had been imprisioned until recent past.Eye openning experience!", October 2012
129,5.0,Definitely worth a trip,"Having visited Seoul 4 times over the past few years, and visiting only the beautiful touristy places, this trip we decided to visit the Seodaemun Prison History Hall to learn more about Korea's history.  Most of the things are rather self explanatory and there are English explanations at some places to tell you more about the story behind. Its an eye opening experience for the family and myself. We got to see the cell where the Korean activist were kept in, the torture chambers, the clothing the prisons wore, execution hall, etc. At the end of the visit, you may leave the place feeling quite disturbed due to the sound effects played and the things you see. Nevertheless, i would still recommend to everyone who visits Seoul to pay a visit to this place.", August 2013
130,5.0,Definitely worth your time,"There are a few buildings for visitors to explore. Each building has interesting things to see and you get to learn how hard it was for the prisoners who were imprisoned there. They had replicas of torture equipment displayed - fingernail removal, crate with inward facing nails, a vertical movement-restricting coffin-like box. The walk through the prison cells is also rather chilling as there're life-sized mannequins of prison guards staring down at you while you walk along the corridors. Look into some of the cells, and you can see (mannequins of) prisoners crouched and wailing. There was one zone that was off-limits to photography as it was where the executions took place. I don't know why, but as I walked into the room, my heart dropped and I felt like crying. It's a very informative museum and it's worth visiting even if you don't understand Korean.", August 2013
131,5.0,Different side to Seoul,"We've been to korea several times and every trip was filled with lots of shopping, beautiful scenery, great food and lots of fun. This time however we decided to learn a little more about Korea's history and decided to visit Seodaemun Prison History Hall. Adult tickets are 1500 Won per person, about a dollar fifty (USD$1.50). Very informative with english explanations and easy to navigate around. Very interesting, sad and an eye opening experience. We got to see the cells that kept the korean independence activists, the torture rooms, the different torture methods used against the koreans, the different prison buildings etc. I recommend this place for everyone that is planning a trip to Seoul. Get to see and experience a different part of the beautiful vibrant city and learn a little more about the country. This place brings chills to the spine, especially when in the execution grounds and theres a tree called the ""Wailing Tree"". It is said that prisoners grabbed that tree before being dragged to the execution grounds with regrets of not succeeding with their independence campaigns/activities. A side note, we went in Summer and it's EXTREMELY hot in korea. The place is not air conditioned so it will be rather stuffy. Bring a hand held fan. To get there, you can take the subway to Dongnimmun Station (Subway Line 3), Exit 5. We took a taxi there and they will drop you off at the Independence Park. Walk all the way to the back of the park and you will see the Prison. About 200m walk.", August 2013
132,5.0,A must-see for any visitor to Seoul,"This museum was extremely well done.  It tells a very interesting and chilling part of Korea's history.  Before travelling to Korea, I knew very little about Korea's history prior to the Korea war.  This museum focuses on the early part of the 20th century when Korea was occupied by Japanese forces.  The prison was used to house revolutionaries fighting for Korea's independence.  The museum starts a little slow, but as you continue, you get to walk through buildings and facilities that were actually used at that time (some are replicas).  It is really frightening to hear when went on in those buildings in the not so distant past and a very moving experience to be standing in them when you learn about it.  The entire experience was quite emotional, but extremely eye-opening and well worth the the time to visit.  I highly recommend it for any visitor to Seoul.", June 2013
133,5.0,A must see when in Seoul,"This prison was built in the early 1900s by the Japanese and is kept as a historical reminder of what happened to Koreans during this time. It is a very sad, eye opening museum. Walking through the prison and seeing the cells where people were tourtured was a harrowing experience. The prison is very cheap to enter- only a few thousand won, and you can look around at your own pace- either with or without headphones.  If you go in winter, be sure to wrap up extra warm- it was colder inside the old prison than out!", January 2013

135,5.0,Seodaemun Prison is a Good Reminder of History,"I almost did not go to this prison since it was a little out of the way for me. But I had already seen all the wonderful palaces in Seoul and decided to take my family here. Wow! Glad I did. The prison was built in 1908 and is a vivid reminder of Japanese cruelty to the Koreans by the Japanese during their many years of occupation and subjugation of Korea. There are photographs documenting the cruelty and you can even go into cells where the Koreans were held. My kids learned an important lesson about war, torture and cruelty of one people by another and hopefully they will remember this when they grow up and become leaders in their own lives. My son opined, ""it's hard to believe how low humans can go."" he is right. This prison is a good learning experience and should be on your list of places to visit just as the European concentration camps are a terrible reminders.", November 2012
136,5.0,Important and intresting,"Seodaemun prison history hall tells a very important story about the korean history. It is a scary place in a beautiful place. The museum has been restored with great thought and humbleness. This is not a place somone is making money on, the entrance fee is just symbolic and there´s no souvenir shop. There are some vending machines with drinks for the same price as outside. I would definetely recommend a visit.", October 2012
137,4.0,"Seodaemun, Not for Children","Seodaemun Prison is a sad and brutal reminder of the 35 year long colonial rule of Korea by Japan. This issue still resonates today becase Japan and Korea often cannot carry out basic diplomacy between each other. Japan has apologized on multiple occassions, but many Koreans feel the sincerity is lacking. While Japanese right-ring politicians (and sometimes Prime Ministers) flame the fires in Korea by claiming the ""comfort women"" issue is not true, or by visiting the Yasukuni Shrine which honors some Imperial era war criminals. I will not delve into the current politics, but Seodamun Prison does reflect a thorn in relations that even today is not easily resolved. Most Japanese buildings in Korea were torched or demolished the days following Japan's defeat in World War II. Indeed, nearly 1,000 Shinto shrines in Korea became bonfires as celebrations swept the country. Korean's feeling resentment for the years of bowing to shinto shrines, being banned from speaking Korean, and the forced adoption of Japanese names were finally free to unleash their rage. In 1996, with much fanfare one of the last symbols of Japan's colonial rule (the Government General Building) was destroyed on live television. Japan had offered to pay for the buildings restoration or removal cost and transportation to Japan, Korea refused and the demolition began. Seodaemun survived in large part, because its use as a prison continued all the way until 1987! There are few places left in Korea where you can see and explore Japanese colonial buildings, the Gunsan port area perhaps being the best preserved district.Seodamun Prison Hall is worth visiting, but I must warn there are gruesome diplays of torture. In Korea some school groups visit the site, but I must disagree wholeheartedly that young children be allowed here. Children below middle school cannot understand how or why this happened. For those who think the displays do not reflect the real history, please feel free to research.", July 2012

In one part of the building, they place all thousands of the prisoners during that time on the wall and it fills all 3 walls. You can see and place yourself inside the jails. But you can not enter nor take picture in the execution building. You can only see it from outside.There's toilets and vending machines in the complex. The site is very clean as other sites I visited in Seoul.The Independence Park, Independence Gate and Independence Hall are nearby. When you exit the prison complex, go to your right-hand side and just walk ahead. You can spend at least 1 hour here since there are several buildings open for public. But if you need to save time, you can jump straight from the Exhibition Building to the Execution Building. But you're going to miss good parts.", December 2011

It was built to house anti-colonial activists back in 1907 and was over populated as most of these prisons were worldwide. Now it houses a museum and memorial to all those that suffered within its walls. You get to read about what occured and how bad it was during those times. There are also artifacts from the past and you can enter the cells or chambers to feel what the political prisoners went through.Its located within the Independance Park and as an overall package a must see while visiting Seoul. It might not be a common choice for most but its worth at times to go off the beaten track., September 2011

This prison has been brilliantly restored to better convey the atrocities committed during Japanese occupation of Korea.  Although this should be a quiet, even solemn visit, the noise level of the many school groups made the visit frustrating at times.  The children had very little supervision and were running around and yelling.  Many of the displays depict the various types of torture inflicted upon the prisoners.  I'm not even sure that school aged children should be looking at this type of thing.  Nonetheless, this site is very informative and so historically important it should be visited.", April 2011
