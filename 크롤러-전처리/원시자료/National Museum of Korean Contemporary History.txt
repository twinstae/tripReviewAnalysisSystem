1,4.0,Intro to Korean history,"A good introduction to Koreas recent history, all info available in English, albeit briefly but nevertheless still there. Some of the exhibition floors not in use presently but for a free entry museum it is a good use of time for those after some cultural capital.", October 2019

3,4.0,Part 2 of National Museum,"This is the Korean contemporary history museum and is a continuation of the history of Korea from the National Museum of Korea. There are plenty of exhibits and so much to read about the Korean war. A great museum, clean, admission and audio guide free of charge. Good way to spend an hour. It is located opposite King Sejong's statue in front of Gyeongbukgung.", July 2019
4,5.0,Fantastic museum - free and open Mondays!,"Fantastic, well-located museum. Right next to palace and American embassy. No admission charge, excellent exhibits on Korean history from before the Japanese occupation through the Korean war to the present.  Really well done and informative, with panels in English and Korean. Also a beautiful view from the rooftop garden. Definitely worth a visit for any visitor interested in history - esp. on Monday when so few things are open but really on any day! They also have a children's museum section which we didn't visit, and a café with coffee drinks and baked goods.", July 2019
