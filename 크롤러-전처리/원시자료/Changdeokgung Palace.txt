You get to see the Throne Hall, with the impressive king's chair.  Other than that, a lot was under repair, and you don't get to access the King's residence building, so not much to see.  We didn't know how or if you could access the Queen's residence building (behind the King's residence building)... so overall, we didn't get to see much; however, the ones we saw were well preserved.", December 2019

There is a separate entrance fee to the garden. Entrance is strictly by guided tours only. It is limited to 100 visitors per guided tour. The English tour is at 2.30pm daily, and the garden is closed on Wednesdays. My visit to this palace was on a Wednesday but was not told the Secret Garden is closed.

Free activities included the Royal Palace Museum and 10.00 changing of the guard parade. Information booths and free pamphlets in multiple languages are available for free and were indispensable. The palace buildings are on a grand scale and beautiful despite being rebuilt after many historical setbacks and unfortunate damage. It doesn't detract from the majesty of the culture and location. The museum is informative and well stocked with interesting artefacts. Gift shops and WC facilities are available everywhere (Carry emergency paper!). The parade was a very entertaining spectacle with accompanying music, drill and PA narration. A pagoda in the distance identifies the Folk Museum Park at the rear. Modern architecture and electronic advertising screens on a large scale are juxtaposed against the ancient/traditional palace environs. On the outside corner of the palace complex lies a'gate' tower and a heavily populated fancy dress hire shop. Many locals and tourists alike hire costumes and enact traditional Korean life all around the city. Glorious and fun!", November 2019

One interesting area is the pharmacy building which has been furnished  in the period of the reigning Joseon royalty.   There was also an area that one could experience the beauty products made for the royal ladies.  It is an expansive area to visit even though some areas are under extensive renovation.  An added feature were visitors and locals dressed in traditional costumes taking advantage of the historical backdrop for photo ops.  These individuals dressed in traditional garments added to the enchantment of this complex.  We did not pay to visit the Secret Garden area. None the less it was still a very magical and enjoyable visit., November 2019

We were served hot Korean tea in a disposable cup and given a goodie bag containing a purse and a bar of soap.

48,4.0,Interesting and quieter palace,I went to Changdeokgung Palace on a Sunday afternoon. It has less much people than Gyeongbokgung Palace. But I was not disappointed. I had opportunity to take many beautiful photos with interruption from other tourists. Don't expect grand buildings here as well as other palaces in Seoul.

55,4.0,Beautiful and serene,"We had very limited time at Seoul, so I only had the option to visit 1 palace during my trip. As we rented hanbok at Bukchon Hanok Village, we decided to go to Changdeokgung as it is a bit closer. The palace is not that big, but we had ample time taking pictures within the palace as there were not many visitors on that day. I wish we could have more time to join the tour for secret garden.", October 2019

If you need a guided tour (Won10,000) and it will last for 1 hour. But if you are in a hurry, you can get the ticket for just Won1000. You can get the ticket either at the main entrance or right in front of the garden entrance.

64,5.0,A beautiful restored palace and area,"This is like a smaller version of the main palace in Beijing.  It is designed very similarly, though a little smaller.  The buildings were rebuilt after the Japanese occupation from 1910-1935, when it was torn down.  They actually had underground heating before the Chinese did. It is a beautiful place.  Try and see the guard change ceremony; it's amazing.  There is a lot of walking and there are really big stairs.  This is not a place for people with movement issued.  I was really tired but the end.  We had a guide and I would suggest one if you really want to understand this place.  What a wonderful experience.", October 2019
65,5.0,Beautiful Korean characteristic monument,, September 2019
66,5.0,Massive place and it’s beautiful ,I hired the traditional “hanbok” dress to wear to the palace and get nice photos.

With more time visiting both on the same day is possible.  Entry is 3,000 won for adults and 1,500 won for youth, garden an additional 5,000/2,400.  The palace can be appreciated wandering on your own or guided tours are available in Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and English throughout the day.  It can get a little crowded so a morning visit may be a better option than afternoon (opens at 0900 daily).

Our guide was very sweet, and very knowledgeable about the history of the palace and the garden. The walk lasts 90 minutes, and there are 4 stops along the way. It is hilly in parts and somewhat shady, but on a warm day a fan is advisable to help keep cool. After the tour we were free to explore the palace, which has many buildings. There was a gift shop where you could also buy a drink but not food. There are 5 palaces in Seoul, but we chose to visit this one purely for the secret garden tour and we were glad we did.", September 2019

98,5.0,"When in Seoul, this is a MUST!","The palaces are beautiful and the grounds are well-landscaped. The original buildings were burned by the Japanese during their occupation of Korea, so these are recreations, but feel ancient. The guides at the library are very kind and helpful providing very interesting information. Take your time, there is a lot to see. It is also common to see people dressed in the garb of that time period which really adds to the atmosphere as you wander the grounds. There is so much history here. And if you are there in the summer, bring the sun umbrellas. It is hot and rain is frequent at that time of year. The little cafe has limited offerings, so you may want to bring food. Note of caution: If you take the Hop On Hop Off bus, they drop you off a quite a ways from the entrance. It is better to get off at the stop prior; it is much closer to the entrance.", August 2019

I almost didn't go to this one, but I'm glad that I did! I like the flair and vibe of this palace a lot more than Gyeongbokgung. The layout of the palace made me feel like I was truly exploring ancient Korea. Make sure to try hanbok when you go (it was around ₩15,000 for 4 hours and the rental store that I went to was right across the street from Chandeokgung), as it authenticates the experience!", May 2019

Also there are many people wearing traditional Korean costumes, making it a very interesting experience.", July 2019
119,4.0,"Beautiful, but it's another palace.","I feel like after about 3-4 of these, they all start looking the same and you just are like ""meh"", that's how I was anyway after visiting this. For me, the real cool part of the palace is the secret garden. Amazing serene spot free of tourists and great for photos.", July 2019
120,4.0,Not so Crowded,The Gyeongbokgung Palace was packed and a very long queue of people so taking a TripAdvisor's suggestion we came here. Beautiful buildings and a calm atmospher so happy with my choice., August 2019
121,5.0,Great place,Can recommend .Make sure you bring water in summer .very big palace .some palaces will look the same .important to us was that we allowed enough time to sit down and take it in ., July 2019
122,5.0,Impressive palace ,"If you rent the typical Korean clothes, you can enter the palace for free. Otherwise you need to pay for a ticket. There are many stores that offer the Korean clothes for rent. The gardens and the palace itself is a half day visit that is really impressive.", August 2019

125,4.0,Palace tour,"Really enjoyed this trip, always like to tour round places like this, and this time it was a family tour, some of our members spoke Korean so we didn't need a tour guide", July 2019
126,3.0,Cute ,Stumbled upon it by accident. It's cute. The admission price is very reasonable. The palace itself and the surrounding grounds are very well looked after., July 2019
127,5.0,Fabulous Tour Guide,"What made this palace stand out was the excellent English-language tour guide who filled out time there with colorful stories of the previous residents of this palace.  We highly recommend that you join one of the frequent tours (including with admission).  It will make the place come alive, instead of being just another palace.  We did not go on to tour the gardens, but were very happy with what we learned on just the palace tour.  Do not miss this when you're in Seoul!", May 2019
128,4.0,Changdeokgung Palace,"This palace is not as crowded and has a huge secret garden or forbidden garden that occupies about 60% of the palace compound. The garden was only accessible to the Korean kings and royal family in the past. The palace itself is not big.  There are free guided tours of palace around 1 hour available in english, chinese and korean. The palace entrance fee is very affordable at around USD3/pax. Garden guided tour fee is a separate fee at USD4/pax and garden tour takes 70 mins. Worth a visit.", July 2019
129,5.0,"Beautiful, authentic","This palace is smaller than Gyeongbokgung palace, but it is still very large, and unlike the larger one, has more original buildings. I recommend taking the english language tour. I feel I got a lot more out of it than just looking at all the pretty buildings, but if you don't have time, grab an english map at the entrance. Also, the signs throughout are in several languages. I also took the secret garden tour, which costs extra. It took me several hours to see everything. I liked this palace best. The tourists and locals walking around in Hanboks made for good pictures too.", July 2019
130,5.0,Very Beautiful,This palace is small than Gyengbokgung but very beautiful with traditional architecture. There is a way links to the Deoksugung which have a lake and very unique glass house. It might take 2 hours to visit this place., June 2019

135,3.0,Good place to use up a few hours...,My wife wanted to visit here and thus we did lol. It was okay - saw the changing of the guard and we walked around the grounds for an hour or so. I feel that once you have seen one Korean palace... you have seen them all. My better half enjoyed it..., July 2019
136,5.0,"Fantastic palace, much more interesting than the larger one!","This is the secondary palace, but has more sections that are authentic and not as rebuilt in the 1980s.  Really gorgeous and also like a nature hike in the middle.  The Secret Garden is a must-do part of the visit. The English-speaking guide who was assigned for everyone (you can't walk solo) was terrific, one of the best guides of my Seoul visit.  We found the palace fascinating and gorgeous, and it's not very far from Bukchon.", June 2019
137,4.0,"If you like history and architecture, this palace is for you",, June 2019
138,4.0,"Beautiful, but also a little lifeless","A very beautifully decorated and in many ways a spectacular place. Old and full of history. Certainly worth a visit. The secret gardenis nice, but on the guided tour, which you must take to visit, you see mainly small temples and buildings, while the garden itself is really more a densely grown park. A little dissapointing. As is the palace surroundings which really are just grass and gravel. Very little you can see of the interior of the palace, so it is relatively quickly done unless you have a strong interest in 17c Korean architecture.", July 2019

144,3.0,Get ready for a 1 and half h guided tour,"Not as beautiful as the Gyeongbokgung to be honest and you must go to the secret garden following a guife, you cannot enter by yourself and it's not worth one and half hour..", June 2019
145,5.0,Another beautiful series of Temples and Palaces near Gyeonghbokgung Palaces,This is a group of Palaces and Temples on large grounds.  Not far from Gyeonghbokgung.  There is a separate entrance and fee for the Gardens., October 2018
146,4.0,BEAUTIFUL AND SERENE SETTING,"Changdeokgung Palace is one of Korea's ""Five Grand Palaces'.  It is definitely worth a visit.  To explore the whole complex takes several hours, but a shorter visit is still very worthwhile.  This was part of our tour of South Korea and Mongolia.  As at other palaces in Sepul, there are many locals in traditional clothes.  Although not required, it is best to have a guide at this site..", June 2019
147,5.0,Secret Garden tour a must !,A portion of palace grounds is limited to a daily quota of visitors and only accompanied by palace guide.  This is the Secret Garden which was the recreational forest of the palace.  About an hour the tour involves fair amount of walking and changes of elevation., June 2019
148,4.0,"Peace, calm, beautiful","Honestly by now I have gone through most of the palaces in Seoul and this one impressed me with its beauty and diversity. I do have to mention that to get into certain parts of the palace you need to pay again, but it doesn't lessen the value of the palace. It is simply beautiful to be there and very meditative. Simply go!", June 2019
149,4.0,Beautiful -- and free entrance for seniors,"Both the buildings and grounds of this palace are delightful -- and it is easily accessible being just a couple of blocks from the Anguk (Line 3, Exit 3) metro stop. For admission to the Secret Garden, one muist have a reservation -- but for seniors (65+), entrance to the palace is free of charge.", June 2019
150,5.0,The main sight to see in Seoul,Must see part of any visit to Seoul..in fact the main attraction. Many Asian and Korean visitors hire traditional dress for the visit which adds to the spectacle. There is a guard changing ceremony you can view at around 10.30A.M so time your visit...lasts around 15 minutes. Leave max two hours for a good tour around and as always best to visit with a guide to get the most of the history. Very modern and clean restrooms on site as well as a decent cafe. Some great views of the temple with the mountain backdrop., June 2019
151,4.0,Secondary Palace,"Following the Japanese Invasion both the first and main Gyeongbokgung Palace and this secondary palace were destroyed, but Changdeokgung Palace was rebuilt quickly and then became the main palace. This unique Korean palace was built in harmony with the landscape and is a true beauty. I did not go to the Secret Gardens though. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Walking thru both Palaces and the Bukchon Hanbok Village will take up much of your day so it's best to get an early start and then head to Insadong Street to browse and eat. These are some of the best sites to see in this section of Seoul.", March 2019

153,5.0,Worth the visit,"This was the second palace I visited and it was the better of the 2. It was ready to get to. I arrived at 9 and it was a great time for picture taking before the crowds. Later school children showed up and it was a lot busier. I took the free English your at 10:15 and paid for the secret garden tour at 11:30. I suggest you take the garden tour, well worth it. There are his to climb, so be aware. You can opt to return to the palace ground before the more strenuous party of the tour.", June 2019

156,5.0,Fascinating,The different palaces and the Korean architecture is very fascinating. Very beautiful place and it feels like travelling to the past as I was walking and seeing different palaces., June 2019
157,5.0,Favourite Palace ,This is one of the most visually beautiful palaces to visit in Seoul. Not only are the structure stunning from the outside with their beautifully painted motifs but the insides are stunning as well including some interesting furnished pieces. Make sure you book tickets for the secret garden ahead of time as it can only be done via a guided tour. It was the highlight of our visit. It is nice to visit via tour as there are less people making the experience more relaxed and it’s easier to take photos with no one in them., June 2019
158,3.0,My expectation was too high..,I think my expectation was way too high and the day I visited was a cold day without much sun. That's why I was little disappointed and it would have been so much better if the day was warmer and brighter., April 2019

160,5.0,Beautiful garden,"The palace is very nice, but the garden is so much nicer. Lots of trees, so a nice place to visit on a hot day. Entering the garden is kinda weird. You have to buy a ticket for a specific time and only at that time you can enter the garden, even though the sign at the garden entrance says you can just go in on your own. You can choose to do a guided tour or walk around on your own.", May 2019

He grew up in a small village after the Korean conflict and shared plenty of local details that few tourists ever know.

198,3.0,Okay: but I’ve probably seen too many palaces,"Caveat to this review is I’ve likely seen too many palaces over the years, and nothing in this one stands out.  What also detracts from the experience is that all the buildings were only built within the last 150 years as the originals were destroyed. So you are seeing fairly", April 2019
