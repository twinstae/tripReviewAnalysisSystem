0,4.0,Ancient village,This area is so beautiful. Perfect for taking loads of pictures while wearing hanbok. The only thing is you need to keep quiet and do not make loud noice as there are people still living in it. Please respect the locals., October 2019
1,4.0,For the Gram,"Perfect for photo spots as the place looks really pretty and nostalgic. Would be great if you could wear a hanbok here just for this purpose. Some slopes to climb but managable even for the elderly. It's an actual residential neighbourhood, so mind your noise and manners. There are shops, tea-houses and cafes that you can pop into. There are walking tours available but those need to be reserved online.", October 2019
2,3.0,Nostalgic,The houses are very nice. Nice place to take a stroll although a bit tiring. It would be nice to go there wearing Hanbok if you love taking pictures. Try not to make much noise because there are people residing in the area., April 2019
3,4.0,Good and quiet ancient village ,Around half an hour walk from the major Palace. Its literally a private residence area. Quiet and the buildings are ancient built. Nice to tour but be careful it is a bit maze puzzle. You could easily enter into the village but not sure where and how to get out haha., February 2020
4,4.0,Good wandering neighborhood,"I first got so lost trying to find a certain restaurant (turns out it was closed), but once you let go and just wander wherever you want, you'll be fine. Walkable distance from the Gyeongbukgong Palace. Lots of cute traditional shops and cool eateries. Be prepared to trek up and down the hills. Be respectful of people's homes of course.", August 2019
5,3.0,Quiet place. For the nostalgic only.,"A stone throw away from Changdeokgung Palace. Thus if one is nearby the vincinity, then perhaps might as well pop by for a look. Nothing much though except for some traditional looking houses and if short on time, its perfectly fine to give it a miss. Do keep the volume down as there are residents there.", February 2020
6,3.0,What village?,Not sure this place ought to be on the map of places to visit. Followed the walk proposed and did see some old houses and lots of old roofs but when you looked carefully the walls of the ‘old’ houses proved it is brand new houses most of them., February 2020
7,4.0,Truly authentic Korean,One of my personal favorite site in the cityRich in local culture especially modern pre-development stage architectWill recommend to all foreign visitors, October 2019
8,3.0,Good to take pictures,"It's a small neighborhood with traditional Korean houses. A good place to take pictures if you're wearing the hanbok. If you do not have much time to spare in Seoul, I would suggest you head somewhere else.", November 2019
9,3.0,Its some houses,"Don't get me wrong the village is nice and some cool photos of the buildings etc, but its just some streets with traditional houses I didn't really get the hype and was a lil bit disappointed once we got there and walked around.", January 2020
10,5.0,What a Lovely Neighborhood - The Place to Be.,"What a Lovely Neighborhood indeed. Very calmed place filled with little streets in between and tiny dead end streets. It can get annoying for a bit trying to go on each and everyone of these tinny streets, but soon enough you'll find out, that is not about getting somewhere, but the beauty that you can photograph at the end of each of these streets. Then you turn around and go on your way to the next. Kinda like this is a journey and not a destination; if I want to get all philosophical and stuff.Therefore after you are done with the cute pictures, remain in the main street of this village and then start to build your way up. You'll find on your left and right side a multitude of nice little shops; we specially loved a tinny flower shop / coffee shop. Very subtle and calm inside, nice jazz music as a background and although South Koreans have the worst coffee to drink in the world; the small pastries kinda make up for this.All in all and without too much mystery, it is worth to go and check one by one these little stores, where you will find also a very nice lady who makes and designs her own clothing (very luxurious and not cheap) but very much worth. Also there is a fine lady who designs her own silver jewelry, very well made and with a nice weight and surprisingly very affordable.Please look at our pictures and find out what we are talking about. Beautiful street indeed and we had a lovely time. This is the kind of streets you need to look for in Seoul. The crowded Millennial streets will drive you nuts with cheap nasty food and cheap Chinese stuff that has no material and spiritual value whatsoever.", January 2020
11,5.0,BEAUTIFUL PLACE,Beautiful neighborhood. Most of the houses are still regular homes (more than commercial businesses). It has typical korean architecture with beautiful roofs.i think is a must see when you are in Seoul., January 2020
12,3.0,CROWDED,Very pretty houses with a ton of people.  We were there at the end of December and quickly left.  There is another street one off and it was almost empty if you are interested in photo ops., December 2019
13,5.0,Walk back in time,This is one of the best area's to stroll through while getting a feel of the old city. The village is basically made up of Hanoks (traditional Korean houses) and little food stalls and restaurants. We enjoyed discovering this little gem by lazily walking through different by lanes., December 2019
14,4.0,More to see,Often people come to hanok village to see the houses... But there's more to see. Hike up to the vilage and be amaze by the view!, November 2019
15,4.0,The cleanest Village!,"I loved the views from Bukchon Village, the restaurants and the old fashioned feel.It is definitely one of Seoul's must-sees.", January 2020
16,5.0,Hanok Vintage Village,"Nice place to walk even during winter with their cafes posted with pictures of owners. All vintage preserved houses become cafe, restaurant or coffee but some still occupied by the owners as houses.", January 2020
17,4.0,Beautiful traditional area,"A traditional resident area. Nice to walk around. I went to an observatory at someones house, 3000won incl tea/coffee, just follow the signs. It was nice and behind glass in the sun so great to warm up at! Also fun shops with handmade stuff around.", January 2020
18,5.0,Great view and amazing vibes,Went here for the first time just to check out the place. It was a nice and serene place and not too hard to walk around (for the elderly and disabled). Highly recommend a visit just to take in the authentic culture of Korea., January 2020
19,5.0,Xmas vacay,"This was a lovely experience with my girls!!! We got dolled up for the traditional dresses- hanbok, going around the neighborhood.  The houses were so beautiful.  The architectural designs of each house was jus amazing.", December 2019
20,5.0,Bukchon Hanok Village,"I don't believe that this is a hidden secret spot in Seoul anymore.  This beautiful gem of a village was teeming with tourists when I was there.  So many people dressed up in traditional costumes to enjoy photo ops utilizing the back drop of historical Korean houses.  There are so many people here that local grannies have their own volunteer patrol with signs to instruct the general public to keep the noise level down.  Despite being crowded, this is such a wonderful area to explore, albeit quite hilly but scenic and definitely great photo ops.  You can spend some time just wandering the roadway and alleys, discovering, cafes, craft shops and art galleries nestled amongst the traditional style hanoks.  Definitely one of my favorite areas in Seoul.", November 2019
21,5.0,Centuries Of History ,"Just about 1 mile north (I think) of Insadong, sits a village you think whose time has passed. You would be wrong. The Village is a mix of shop owners, home owners & people who dress in period costumes while strolling through the quiet streets.", January 2020
22,5.0,Ancient village in central Seoul,"Ancient village in Seoul, where there are still residence living there. There are scouts who try to remind visitors to respect the residence and not to be loud while visiting .Many instances able pics can be taken here.", January 2020
23,5.0,"Get out the Sneakers, Camera, and Enjoy!",If you have seen Korean TV dramas or movies and want to experience the ambiance of a time gone past -- this is the plase to visit.  Make sure that your camera is charged and have an extra card to store photos -- and enjoy the day., December 2019
24,5.0,Interesting preview into the past,Visited this place on a cold Saturday. Went up to the youth cultural corps and they provided high school students to help guide you along the place. The two student guides were super informative and helped provided so much info and thus such meaning to the place. Overall it was intriguing to get a sneak preview of the lifes of these Korean officials. Especially like how they dried persimmon  and make alcohol., December 2019
25,4.0,A quiet and great place to take photos,We can rent hanbok for an hour before taking a walk. The area is residential area so we need to walk quietly to not bother the residents., October 2019
26,4.0,Great architecture ,"The village is in the residential area, you have to be respectful and not make too much noise. You can walk around the village and see how beautiful the houses were built.", December 2019
27,3.0,Easy sightseeing ,"This is my 2nd Hanok village in Korea. It’s not quite as immersive as Jeonju, it’s a lot smaller but it’s very cute set in steep streets with sweeping views of the city.People live here still! It will probably only take you 30 minutes to explore the village.", December 2019
28,4.0,Uniquely Seoul,"Bukchon Hanok Village is the largest cluster of Korean hanok homes in Seoul.  When wandering through this neighborhood, it’s fascinating to think that people actually live there.  The neighborhood has a charm all its own that is unique to Seoul.  It’s a nice walk that can take all day, depending on how quickly one progresses through the picturesque streets.  The main arteries have hanoks that have been converted for commercial uses so aside from the architectural wonders, there is a lot of retail shopping to be done while taking breaks in between for great meals and coffee breaks.  Additionally, the views are worth the walk, as parts of the walk are hilly and so great views of Seoul pop up along the way.", April 2019
29,4.0,Modernity and tradion can co exist,A fine example that modernity does not have to obliterate the old world. Of note are the hanoks which have been taken over by the city govt to preserve and be used as mini-museums., December 2019
30,4.0,Traditional Korea,"We loved wandering these streets and shops. Great photo ops and beautiful old homes. Very relaxing day, visit a tea shop or art studio.", September 2019
31,4.0,Not as hyped but good all the same,"Nice walk and interesting as well but as much to see as I thought,  in part because it is so popular making it difficult at times.Do stop at the Onion Cafe just before the start  - great little place.", December 2019
32,4.0,Passionate tour guides,"I joined the Bukchon tour by guides Nayoung and Jenny. Both volunteers were passionate about sharing the Korean history and culture with the group and I had a good time. They initially refused my tips but I insisted. Keep in mind that these young people are not professional tour guides so things could be rough on the edges, but I enjoyed hearing what their lives are like in Seoul.", December 2019
33,4.0,Characterful ,"This was my 2nd visit here and I have to say that I enjoyed it a lot more this time as I was on my own and able to wander around the way I wanted to. Bukchon is a hillside village (almost) of traditional hanok (Korean house) with lots of wood, attention to detail and character. It makes for a lovely contrast between the old and new with views across the rooftops towards modern Seoul. It's definitely worth a mooch around, but be aware that there are very steep slopes and steps so it's not ideal for those with mobility issues or indeed those who are unfit.Bukchon is a short walk from Cheongyecheon/ Myeongdong.", November 2019
34,3.0,A taste of history that's all,Not very stroller friendly as there were many slopes and constructions going on. Had a nice taste of history but that's about it, December 2019
35,5.0,Fantabulous Lovely Village,"Bukchon Hanok Village is home to hundreds of hanoks, traditional Korean houses, that date back to the Joseon Dynasty. Love the cultural village and the architecture of the houses here, it is said that certain areas are to be kept quit when visiting as the people in this village love to preserve their serenity. There are some rich people whom stay here in this village. Many great scene and pictures with lovely scenery not to be missed.", December 2019
36,4.0,Cute little village in the middle of a busy city,"I went up to Hanok village with a couple of friends, prompted by Trip Advisor’s recommendation. I would say i found it to be slightly less glamorous than in the pictures one finds online. And also it’s not big. Like 3 blocks. One has to be super quiet while walking up those streets; there are signs everywhere mentioning that. It is also very crowded with tourists; people who are having an entire photoshoot in the middle of the street. The Bukchon observatory is underwhelming: just a tall house towering over the others. One last thing: if you are tired of walking already or are having back/hip issues (like i did today), you will find this climb up those streets challenging. I was in pain and it wasn’t fun.", December 2019
37,5.0,The Best Red Bean Pankakes Ever! ,"This small, quaint village was a lively place to visit. It presented a lot of traditional housing and Korean day-to-day lifestyle. Although it was a bit of a hike, the people were lovely and were confidently showing us their various artworks, handmade clothes and so on. The architecture was sensational and having a Red Bean Pankake is a must-do! I would advise being cautious when bringing young children or large groups as it could disturb others and they have posters almost everywhere about remaining quiet. The village itself links into the main town which is also advisable to visit, and is nearby to other attractions.", December 2019
38,5.0,Interesting area of Seoul,"I love this area of Seoul mainly for the traditional homes mixed with the cafes, small shops, and various art  galleries.  It can be a very crowded area, since is lot of bus tours drop groups of tourists off. Go earlier in the day to try and avoid the large groups. Most of all remember real people live in these homes so be respectful and keep the noise level to a minimum.", November 2019
39,4.0,Bukchon Hanok Village,"The traditional village of the Korean old house. Beautiful place for photo and can feel the life of their old way. The new experience to be felt. During winter the weather was cool, quite difficult for us to explore the village. Other seasons must be more Nice", December 2019
40,3.0,Quiet place,It's a peaceful place to shop after visiting gyeongbokgung palace. There are tourist guides around to assist tourist. Rmb to visit Granhand shop for their local scents, December 2019
41,5.0,Traditional Korean Houses ,"Great place to take photos, come early to avoid the crowd. Hanbok rentals are available at the entrance, but the ones below the street are cheaper.", November 2019
42,5.0,Korean House Original Style,"Korean traditional residence Village.I Only have 5 minute to take some picture and explore in the mean street only. I need more time to explore it. Keep quite and take a picture in every corner..... do not make sound. Just enjoy the ambiance. Better go to this place in the morning, or your first destination before crowd  coming. so you will have a clean area to pose. I give you examples...", December 2019
43,3.0,A bit of history,It's easy to find the moment you are out of the subway because you will see people in costumes & costumes rental shops.Nice little area but too touristy and I find it sorry for the people living there.Many China tourists and they can be overwhelming.Remember to keep quiet and civilised when you are outside the residences., December 2019
44,5.0,Amazing Place,"Very awesome exprience walked through the narrow road of Bukchon Village,very cold but had good time .should visit this little village again in futureLike so much the environment.", December 2019
45,4.0,Good to take pictures,"very cold because it's outdoor.. but if you go there, you will have an unforgettable experience!! i love hanok <3 you can see it for free (in fact, people live, so be quiet...)but food is a little expensive..in conclusion, ssssssuper recommended for families, couples, and all alone", December 2019
46,5.0,Nice place,"Been here last Dec 7, 2019 and the first day of snow! Totally awesome experience for us who came from the Philippines. From MTR Anguk station exit 2 and walk straight. And Red clad tourist guides were visible giving assistance. Nice traditional Korean houses to see.", December 2019
47,5.0,A awesome fillings.,"It was a awesome fillings when we walked through the ups and downs narrow road of ""Bukchon Hanok Village"". A peaceful fillings was touching on our mind while walking through the village.The old and historical types of buildings were great to see.", October 2019
48,3.0,Conflicted,"The architecture is beautiful,  without a doubt. Looks new too, which I guess is expected because you don't expect a 600 years + building to still be standing without work done to restore it. I enjoyed walking in the less popular alleyways where I had the time and space to reflect upon the history of the people who lived here way before my time.Now- these are also people's home and the many signs posted on the walls remind you this, and to be quiet. And even though no one said anything to me it reay felt voyueristic and sorta intrusive.  (I saw 2 or so elderly women walk past tourists on the steps of their houses to get inside). I tried to imagine how I'd  feel like if day in, day out, I had to contend with throngs of tourists taking pictures outside my house. I imagine during the warmer months, opening a window is neat impossible what with the  hoarders of strangers milling about.  Should you go? Depends on you and what you feel comfortable with.", December 2019
49,3.0,A quiet walk,This is a beautiful old area of Seoul. It is very steep to walk so be prepared.The reason for my average rating is the fact that this is a residential area with signs everywhere asking you to be quiet! Very difficult if you are with someone and are trying to converse about the buildings.Many of these have signs requesting no photos so it means you are just walking up and down the streets. It is also VERY crowded., October 2019
50,3.0,Wandering in someone's neighbourhood,"The beginning of the walkabout through this active neighbourhood is lined with shops and tourist trinket traps.  But go in deeper and you will discover that you are essentially walking in someone's backyard, albeit the construction and style of the homes are not what we are used to.  Let's back up...Bukchon Hanok Village is a residential area of about 3-4 blocks square where the  buildings were constructed in the era and style of yesteryear... perhaps 150 years ago.  Hence, old bamboo and plaster construction.  Great for architects and history buffs, boring for everyone else.  Sure, some great photo ops of the city skyline and any number of people wearing the traditional Korean dress (Hanbok) but essentially, you are one of thousands wandering through someone else's home and neighbourhood.  And the homeowners are not necessarily all that inviting.  Signs and people constantly remind you to keep your voices down.  It's a nice wander but not really all that exciting or impressive.  Meh.  3 stars.", November 2019
51,4.0,Helpful ambassadors ,"Good place to visit to see authentic houses (local people still stay there!). However, we visited on a monday and the traditional house for viewing (free admission) was closed. Pls also take note of the hours for walking around as it is residential area e.g. no walking around on sundays and only within a certain timing (9.30 to 5.30pm? Need verification- cannot remember the details). Look out for Chinese and English speaking tour ambassadors in the area who would be helpful to assist you.", December 2019
52,5.0,Korea's best kept secret,"Bukchon Hanok Village is home to hundreds of hanoks, traditional Korean houses. This is one of the top things to do in Seoul. It's located between the 2 most beautiful palaces in the city. It is a chance to step back in time and have a closer look into Seoul of the olden days. Just let ourself get lost in the narrow alleys. Bukchon Hanok Village is a residential area so  keep the noise level as low as possible.Finally here, for us another bucket list checked. Vsiting Hanok Village while wearing Korea traditional Hanbok!!!!!!", November 2019
53,5.0,historical and meaningful,"As u walk from the subway station towards Bukchon Hanok Village, look for the tourism ambassadors decked out in bright red uniform & hat. They will offer u a physical map and recommend a route for u to follow so that u will not be lost figuring out where to go inside Bukchon Hanok Village. The walking route is highly recommended as u get to see lots of stuff which u might miss if u cluelessly wander around.", November 2019
54,4.0,Quaint and still inhabited by real people,"A historical village with lots of charm, mixed with retail and inhabitants. Enjoy strolling through the ancient alleys and stopping to check out the historical units, shoppes and eateries.", November 2019
55,5.0,Traditional Korean houses ,"This is a residential area with hundreds of traditional Korean houses called hanoks. The area is open to visitors between 9 am and 5 pm. There are a number of alleys in the village through which you can take a walk. Though there are sign posts requesting tourists to keep their voices down so as to not disturb the residents, we found many tourists disregarding this. There are guards in the alleys who also keep making this request. There are lot of boutiques, souvenir shops and food stalls in the village. The walk was a very pleasant one and the architecture was unique. It felt like being a part of their homes and culture. A must do if you are in Seoul", April 2019
56,4.0,Charming hilly neighborhood ,"On a hill between the two famous palaces, this area is very pleasant for a 1-hour stroll around traditional houses. There are a few eating and coffee places.", November 2019
57,4.0,Pleasant Walkaround ,A nice quaint district to walk around observing the hanok architecture.  About 1km or 20mins walk from Gyeongbokgung Place.  Slightly hilly and good walking shoes are best., November 2019
58,4.0,Good experience ,The Hanok village is conveniently located near the Gyeongongbuk Palace and its definitely worth visiting after leaving the palace. It recreates the “authentic” Korean experience and has a lot of souvenir shopping opportunities. I was unsure of photo opportunity though so I didn’t snap., November 2019
59,5.0,A good walk in Bukchon,We spent almost whole day here walking around. Bukchon Hanok Village is the real residential area with 900 hanoks. There are many interesting photo spots here especially when you put on the rented Hanbok!, November 2019
60,5.0,Historic area with character,Went to this residential neighborhood and learned about the history of the locals. The neighborhood has hills so be prepared but it’s not too challenging. Make sure to drop by at the coffee shop called onion. Fantastic baked goods and you can see the architectuee typical to this area., November 2019
61,5.0,Bukchone Hanok Village,A great and beautiful place to visit. You need to be quiet while walking along the area as there are people living there., November 2019
62,3.0,Too many noisy tourists,This traditional Korean village is beautiful but is somewhat destroyed by inconsiderate tourists who talk loudly and make too much noise in a residential area. Pity., October 2019
63,5.0,Quaint Traditional Korean Village,"This place has maintained the traditional cultural look of a Korean village and has opened the streets for tourists. There are rules here, though.

66,3.0,nice and authentic,"not easy to find this place, as I walked and walked trying to look for this place.  it is a village where people are living, so we dont really see inside of their house, is quite tiring too as this village is just a two rows of village", December 2018
67,4.0,Nice little get away,Visited this as part of a hop on and off bus tour and spent about 45’ there. Interesting but very touristy... and I found it difficult to watch and understand the performances... but the garden is nice and there are good restaurants nearby!, November 2019

70,4.0,Tucked away treasure,Very interesting to see a traditional Korean village in the middle of Seoul.  Wonderful wooden doors lead to secluded courtyards and private areas where people live. Rather steep hills await the walker. Cafés are nearby., October 2019
71,5.0,Peaceful in the morning - busy in the afternoon!,"If you want to experience this area without throngs of tourists, get up early and walk around in the quiet before 10am.  There’s and easy map with a route to follow for beautiful views of the traditional rooftops and the hills surrounding Seoul.  Gorgeous in November with changing leaves.

76,5.0,Very interesting. Beautiful area.,We visited on our own and with a guide. Definitely recommend with a guide. We used Top Korea Tour Our guide was Miae. Learning about he history and current-day occupiers of this area was interesting, October 2019
77,5.0,"Beautiful, traditional and quiet",This is one of the most wonderful suburbs in all of Seoul. You can get lost in the many streets up and down Bukchon. Check out the many trendy cafes and stop in at one of the delightful pubs or drinking spots. I’d recommend everyone visiting Seoul spend an afternoon in Bukchon! Love it!, October 2019
78,5.0,Just go through the hanok village,Although I did not stay very long at this place I really enjoyed going there.  I like the contrast of these old Korean traditional houses with the Seoul building.  if you are looking good you can find cute little cafe and have quieter places where everyone gathered to make pictures in hanbok.  I recommend this place by staying there for several hours does not really interest.  thought to also respect the tranquility of the inhabitants (the houses are not empty but well inhabited)., November 2019
79,3.0,Good introduction to 'old' Seoul,Bukchon is a nice place to have a leisurely walk along narrow streets and old buildings where you can catch glimpses into hanok courtyards and there are plenty of places to stop off for a drink or a spot of shopping. The only annoyance is the hundreds of young Koreans in hanbok (traditional dress) constantly taking photos of each other so you have to endlessly stop and wait for them to finish., September 2019
80,1.0,For Instagram only,Cringy tourists taking ridiculous photos here for their Instagram. Don’t waste your time here. More historic views/buildings elsewhere., November 2019

83,3.0,Bukchon Hanok Village,"A nice stop to walk around, located on a hill, many alleys, can be very crowded.  I do not feel it is a must see. There is a long history to this village.  Located between 2 of the palaces.Houses are in the hanok style.", September 2019
84,3.0,Very much over rated area,"If you don't intend to do anything except shop in Seoul you might find the area interesting. It mainly consists of narrow lane ways edged with new and some older style houses, it is somewhat lacking in authenticity. You will mainly see roofs but the occasional house is visible. Many houses are now coffee shops or boutiques. When travelling around Seoul, if you keep your eyes open you will see much more genuine examples of older style Korean houses. This is the most disappointing Korean attraction I have come across. Perhaps it is worth a look if you are visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace as it is close by. See it first because after the palace it would be rubbish. South Korea has some amazing sights, but this isn't one of them.", October 2019
85,5.0,Very interesting ,"Beautiful traditional Korean houses lined up this village, which is free entrance. Touring this Village, one has to be silent as these are residences and they don’t want to be disturbed understandably.", November 2019
86,5.0,Bukchon Hanok,"Lovely quaint place with plenty of little shops offering good food, coffee, dessert. A bit of a steep walk but wee worth it. The place gives you great photo opportunities.", October 2019

88,4.0,Bit of a peek in to history,"Personally not impressed with the visit while one do see the Korean style homes and some of the traditional arts like dyeing with natural substance, incense making etc. The center is good but not sure I will consider it as a must see", October 2019
89,4.0,Traditional ,Good chance to see traditional houses from the exterior amongst new modern style houses in a very regenerated area of Seoul. Lovely views at the top., October 2019
90,4.0,New Money Rebuilding Old Houses,"This hillside district is an interesting place to walk, but the people who live here for it’s charm put up unwelcoming signs and have people stationed around the neighbourhood with signs saying “shhh”. That said, the houses are beautiful (on the outside) and well worth a look. The streets are narrow and can be dangerous for pedestrians. The area is also quite popular with tourists, so expect a crowd. Visiting people do dress in traditional costumes, so there are lots of photo opportunities.

92,5.0,A lovely Village to visit,"Arrival to Hanok Village to have understanding about traditional houses and culture of Korean.Trust me, you’ll have nice pictures here. There’s a delicious restaurant of Ginseng Chicken Soup nearby that you can try. It’s one of special dishes in Korea.", March 2019
93,4.0,Tiring but Worth the Effort,"Just behind where we are living (itself in Bukchon).  The village is very pleasant.  While we were there, the place had tourists who, except for one, maintained the pleasant quiet of the neighborhood and the respect for its residents.Because it was a Tuesday, the “museums” we wanted to see were closed.  However, just walking around and seeing the old buildings , which are juxtaposed against new magnificent villas, was a pleasure.The prospective visitors should be warned of the topology: it is inevitable that you will climb and descend some steep inclines; sometimes using steps and sometimes without. Tiring but definitely worth the effort.", October 2019
94,3.0,Nice but crowded,"It is a good spot to view older buildings, is Hanok style. There is a popular trail that many visitors take, which makes some parts of the street rather crowded.Given that the village is sandwiched between palaces, it is nice to walk through the village after visiting one palace and on the way to the other. Overall, I found only a few spots in the village that was nice but awfully crowded. Perhaps coming earlier in the morning would have been better.", October 2019
95,3.0,"Quaint, but not a must-see","The neighborhood is quaint, in parts - some of the buildings are maintained in the old style, some are modern. They're largely intermixed together. Most of the buildings can only be admired from the outside; you can't enter. Also note that this is entirely a residential neighborhood with one main thoroughfare with tourist shops and eateries. To get the full effect of the old-style housing you'll need to wander into the side streets with the residences.Notes:- If you're looking for an anchor point, look for the Bukchon tourist center. Get a walking map of the neighborhood; it will help- In case it's not obvious from the pictures, it is a hill climb. A STEEP hill climb, in some parts", October 2019
96,2.0,"Love the architecture, feel sorry for residents ",We love history and culture and are firm believers of preserving heritage. This area is of historic interest and definitely of historical Korean architecture value. The sad part is the fact that these are actually people’s homes and therefore make it quite sad. People have day in and day out strangers on their doorsteps dressed in fancy folk dress taking endless photos and making an enormous noise. Yes I wanted to see it for myself however felt sorry for the residents. The younger Korean visitors dressed in fancy folk dress couldn’t care less. I wish they shown a little more respect.Part of me say don’t visit to give the residents a little rest but it’s definitely of historical interest., October 2019
97,5.0,So much fun!,"We visited here and decided to dress up in traditional hanboks. They rental stores are all around and rent on an hourly basis.

99,4.0,Lovely stroll,"Traditional houses dot the hillsides of the traditional Bukchon neighborhood.

103,5.0,Worth it,We spent two hours and took lots of pictures. One day it will disappear. A very pictoresque area. A purely walking area., October 2019
104,3.0,Worth a few minutes walk through.,"If there you must go up the hill.  We followed the signs to the Observatory, but never made it the whole way.Disappointed in that we had hired a private guide to show us all over Seoul, but because there is no place to park near the 'village' (which is practically downtown), he just dropped us off for 30 minutes on our own with a designated pick-up spot.", September 2019
105,4.0,Nice to see a bit of preserved history,"I liked walking around this village and soaking up the cute architecture, but also the idea that these little walkways have been walked up & down for many many years.

There is a lot of walking on hilly streets and stairs. It is not all original, most buildings have been renovated or are new construction but still with the same style as the old ones. This is a residential area so cars are allowed and the residents stand outside with signs asking visitors to be quiet. There are lots of shops and restaurants", September 2019
107,4.0,Nice,Had a nice walk here. Full of shops and tea houses. Some sold traditional handcrafted items. Would recommend it., September 2019
108,3.0,Crowded but interesting.,This is a residential neighborhood of very old homes.  The houses are not open to the public but the streets (many very steep streets) are interesting to roam about (quietly because people actually live here).  Great for photographers.  Many visitors rent Hanbok costumes and pose for photos.  Lots of little shops and places to eat along the way.  Streets can be crowded on weekends., September 2019
109,3.0,Beautiful from a distant ,"as this is still an actual residential area the inside of the house can’t be seen, but it is the interior + exteriors that makes the Hanok ever interesting ... fine other hanok villages that allow you to have a meal in it I.e onion cafe", September 2019
110,3.0,Should visit but will probably not revisit ,"The taxi ride from our hotel in Gangnam-gu to Bukchon Hanok was 32000 won. What makes it worse was that the Naver Map direction didn't bring us to the correct spot. We were left at the end of the street near a park and had to walk for 20 minutes looking for the old village. Well not exactly old. Its a residential area with old houses and people still live in it. Snap some pictures and good to go. One of the checklist. And oh yeah, decent amount of climbing needed especially when with kids", September 2019
111,3.0,Quaint Village - Go Early!,"I wish I had read the prior review before wandering over to Bukchon Village. I have been to the neighborhood independently (not part of a tour group) a few times and it is lovely however, very crowded.  The area is located very near Insadong,  Gyeongbokgung Palace, and Changdeokgung Palace so a combined visit is absolutely possible.  You can get a little map of the area that slows ""8 views of Bukchon Village"" which is a nice guide for a non-guided tour visit.  Walking through just to enjoy the small homes, stores, and tea shops is also possible and enjoyable.  The major downside to visiting this area is the hordes of tourists dressed in Hanbok trying to take the perfect picture down the quaint alleyways - difficult to just enjoy when you are trying to dodge disrupting their photoshoot.", September 2019
112,3.0,Not what we were expecting,"Visited with my family on Sunday morning.Perhaps our expectations were unrealistic (was expecting a real old town/visit to the past experience), there were signs all over asking visitors to behave (talk with lower voice, not get in, not peeing, etc.); to me is just a nice residential area where the people living there seem to be annoyed by all the tourists.Took a few pictures and headed to Insadong, that was more fun than this.", September 2019
113,4.0,Early morning visit was perfect time,"We visited early before people were up and loved walking the quiet streets.It was magical.But by the time we left, hoards of tourists were arriving .The neighborhood is a major tourist attraction,so if you want to capture the magic,go early.", September 2019
114,4.0,Long walk but what a view!,"You'll need your walking shoes to get up there. Steep narrow roads but for those who love Korean architecture, this is a must see. Fantastic view of Seoul skyline from the top of the hill too. Breathtaking. Got to keep your voice down though because there are people living in the houses.", September 2019
115,4.0,Must visit for tourists,"Its a long alley filled with Korean traditional houses. It just gets crowded with tourists. As i know, there are still people living in them so visitors are discouraged to make too much noise. I didnt go walk further because there were too many people.", September 2019
116,4.0,The Past Retained,"Located between the Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgong Palaces and just a short walk from the Anguk Metro Station you will find a little section of old Seoul retained. It is a mix of old and new, traditional and tacky but it is very interesting. Take the walk from Exit 3 from the station and walk up the hill . The place is well-signed and maps are available of the area showing the preferred walk. It is about a 3 KM walk and some points give good views of the city and the old buildings with their tiled roofs.", September 2019
117,5.0,Neighborhood With Many Traditional Houses,"Bukchon Hanok Village, in a Northern hilly area of Seoul, is my favorite neighborhood in the city because of its distinctive traditional architecture, known as hanok. Boasting several hundred of these homes, it has the largest number that still remain in the metropolis. On my most recent visit to Seoul, I took a friend here to introduce her to this earlier-era style that relies on natural materials. The one-story, tile-roof houses with patterned walls, first designed and built in the 14th century, feature an interlocking framework of uwooden beams that rest on blocks of stone. Other elements often used include earth, clay, straw and paper made from mulberry bark. The traditional courtyard garden remains hidden from the street.We stopped first at Bukchon Tourist Information before the village for free maps and brochures. The man working there spoke excellent English and proved to be most helpful. But we did not go there directly. Instead, we stood looking confused about where to go at a crossroads and were approached by a mobile tourist information rep. Dressed in a red jacket and red hat, he was in the area to offer assistance to tourists, armed with English, Japanese and Chinese language skills. I have never witnessed this service in other cities worldwide. These reps can be seen throughout popular tourist destinations in Seoul and have steered me in the right direction more than once.As we ascended the hill, the hanoks suddenly appeared and the modern city had been left behind. Many of the houses have been turned into tea houses, restaurants and workshops, but there are still private residences galore. Two women in yellow hats and yellow vests with “Please be Quiet” in English, Japanese and Chinese emblazoned on the front and back walked along the narrow alleys, often putting an index finger to closed lips. I also noted a poster on one wall, requesting visitors to be quiet. It appears that the residents would like less noise in their neighborhood.We arrived here in midday and it was like tourist central. Despite efforts to keep noise down, many visitors could have cared less. One even noticed a gate ajar and rushed into the courtyard of a private home to take a photo. But there were plenty of photo ops along the alleys and at the top of the hill, where a stunning view of Seoul could be captured. We headed off to more quiet streets to simply soak in the atmosphere. In the past, I have gone here in early morning and the whole area was naturally quiet.Bukchon Hanok Village can be reached by subway line 3, Anguk stop. Take exit 2 or 3 and follow the directional signs.", November 2018
118,4.0,Nice traditional architecture in the middle of a bustling city,"When we visit anywhere new, I always like to have some historical places to visit as well as seeing how local life is at present.  Having seen lots of castles and shrines already, a traditional village, where people still live, sounded like an interesting place.It really was beautiful, and in some places, the contrast with these ancient homes ith th buildings of modern Seoul in the distance showed how the city has changed.  There were several girls walking about in traditional hanbok costumes, and that enhanced the feeling that this probably had looked the same hundreds of years ago.  All of that, I liked.  A lot.But, if you head to Seoul, or anywhere in Asia in the summer, it's going to be hot.  Because it's hot, it's not the peak tourist season, but that doesn't mean that tourists aren't out in force.  Just like us, hundreds of others decided to come here mid-afternoon; it was very crowded.  In order to get decent photos of the architecture, etc.. you have to be pretty creative in angling your shots, or at the very minimum, wait it out for enough people to walk by so you can get a picture.I would guess that this is pretty typical no matter what time of year you're here, so if I were going to go back, I would head there first thing in the morning, when the residents are about the only people you'll see in the streets.", August 2019

Crowds take away some charm from this place.", August 2019
150,5.0,Past meets present. Bring comfy shoes.,"Bukchon was really the only thing I wanted to see in Korea. We went on a tour and I was quite disappointed, not by the village, but by the tour guide who rushed us through. It also started pissing it down raining. I managed to get some decent shots which I have to edit, but I could have used more time. The houses are all still inhabited and are worth upwards of a million dollars each. Although the facades are required to be preserved, the interior of the houses are all very modern and updated. There's signs asking tourists to keep their voices down, no loud pictures, music or talking. I guess some rude westerners had caused problems in the past. Anyway, bring comfy walking shoes as there are a lot of hills in the village. Bring a wide angle lens as well.", July 2019

It’s located on in a hilly neighborhood nestled between Gyeongbok Palace and Changdeok Palace which are both walkable for this location. While I strolled through Bukchon Village up, down, back and forth it may feel like a trip through the ages, the neighborhood is not frozen in time. Some of the hanoks are still private homes, but others have been converted into tea houses, coffee shops. These are neat little places to get a look inside on of these beauties majority of them be historically updated renovations but they kept it to the err of time.

They also offer wearing of Hanbok for only 7000KRW in one day.The area is a community, with people living in the old houses so they have these signs which tells you to minimize your noise. But when you walk around, it feels like tradition meets modernization. Roofing of houses are still old but there are newer buildings which conforms to traditional architecture.

It is a general uphill walk to view the traditional houses in narrow lanes, called hanok, that dated back to the Joseon Dynasty.Most of these houses are private residential, hence there are many signs as well as staff to remind visitors to lower their noises. Some of these hanoks operate as souvenir shops, restaurants and tea houses. Well worth a visit together with the nearby palaces.", June 2019

189,4.0,See The Open House,"The walk through this traditional neighborhood was enhanced by visiting a home that the city had acquired and opened to visitors.  We were able to walk into the courtyard and then after removing our shoes, enter the house where 3 rooms were available to us to walk through.  In one room, traditional tables and chairs were setup on the floor but it was not so easy to sit down.  In the other rooms were displays of vases made out of wood and a person was available to answer questions.  We continued walking through the very narrow and sometimes steep streets looking at the other homes and cafes.  We also stopped by the Bukchon Traditional Crafts Experience Center which was a building that housed a number of local craftspeople who taught you about traditional Korean crafts for a small fee.", June 2019
190,3.0,Holiday,"I heard so much about this place I had to go. The issue for me is I was expecting a self contained village of original traditional style. The buildings are styled in the traditional sense but they are mixed between modern apartments and houses. There is really only one street with the same style of housing and the sight of air conditioners, wiring and hot water services detracts from the traditional aspect. There are attendants at each end of the street holding signs asking people not to make noise as this disturbs the residents. There are a few souvenirs shops and some very modern cafes in the village. Pleasant to look at overall but nothing like the promotion given to the area.", June 2019
191,4.0,Area with traditional houses,"Bukchon village is actually a private housing estates prized with traditional Hanok houses. Hence, there will be volunteers to ask you to not to make too much noises to avoid disturbing the residences. It is located near the gyeongbukhung and changdeokgung palace grounds and within walking distance from Anguk station. It is just an area with lots of traditional houses where you can rent Hanboks and walk around the area for photo taking. It is a very tiring climb and not recommended for older folks with knee issues. But the hike up is worth is for the magnificent view. We did not pay for the observatory as the view up on the hill was good enough. Worth a visit but only if you are in the area.", June 2019

194,5.0,Do visit with a guide,The area is not very big but you can get disoriented and end up going around in circles. Best to go with a local or plan your walking route well. Buildings here are beautiful and some are renovated so you can spot the difference roofing modern and original. Do look out for the beautifully hand crafted clay tiles in some of the original roof of the Hanoks. Do make a stop at the Baek Inje House in Gahoe-dong area. This is free and you can see the interior layout of a typical Hanok house. Absolutely beautiful!, June 2019

200,4.0,Picturesque glimpse of the past,"This historic area is definitely worth a visit while you're in Seoul. I went on a weekday, so it was less crowded than I've heard it gets at the weekends. You'll encounter many people walking around in traditional clothing they've hired for the day - this adds to the atmosphere if you set your imagination to work! The village is hilly and very pretty in the springtime, with some great views over nearby areas of Seoul.

202,3.0,Somewhat underwhelming,"There’s no clear path to follow through this traditional village in a sense that, you just wander through the streets but aren’t told where to look or what to look at. We found this didn’t allow us to properly engage with the location, and as a result we most likely didn’t get the most out of our visit. Some of the houses you see will be the most beautiful in the entire city, but it’s still hard to distinguish what’s what here.", May 2019
203,4.0,Picturesque,"Great to look at, you feel you've stepped back a century. Other than that novelty bear in mind it's a residential area so doesn't really have anything other than the experience of the traditional houses (from the outside only) to offer. Great photo ops.", May 2019

You can spend sometime here and need to walk up to high slope across all the street. The scenery here is beautiful. You can take few pics on how this unique street looks so traditional and beautiful.

212,5.0,A moment to reflect ,"We were lucky enough to walk through the streets to the less crowded ones and come across the Bukchon Observatory ... when no one was there. It was 3000 per adult, which included a beverage and a balcony to sit and contemplate the scene and passage of time of the 600 year old village below. We enjoyed tracing our way up and over the hill and admiring the detail of the homes while respecting the privacy of the residents in the area who are constantly faced with the selfie stick / Instagram crowds chattering away and blocking the streets or posing with private property rather than simply enjoying the architecture and vibe of the area.", May 2019

225,3.0,Interesting but not worth going out of the way to see,This was part of a tour and it's lots of traditional houses in a specific part of Seoul. The houses are not open to the public and before you go you are asked not to make too much noise as its residential. There are people there  with signs saying don't make too much noise. You really don't see the houses inside it's just the exterior and they are 100 years old it was interesting but I don't think I would make it my business to take time out to go there to see it specifically. It would be nice if one hone was on view., May 2019

Also, just South nearby, is a restaurant called Warm Kitchen, Share Kitchen (opposite the Library and just beyond Pink Butter café in Samcheong-ro 2-gil Road - where you will see a man in a Panda costume to entice you in: don't be put off!) which was a very tasty place for a quick lunch and good value :)", April 2019

After lunch taking the subway 1 stop to Anguk and take the exit to Bukchon. Walked on the main road northwards for about 5-10 mins. You will reached the obvious entrance of the village on the left.

You’ll also see them bringing placards reminding everyone to be quiet.-You will also see a lot of souvenir shops in the area. Some food stalls too in case you need something to munch in.CONS:-There’s nothing much to do other than take photos with the old houses as your background-Tourists flock to the area on a daily basis so be prepared to get your way to get good photos-If you’re bringing a car, there’s not much parking space available as the alleys are really narrow.

289,4.0,More a precinct than a village.,"It was super fun to walk the narrow roads past beautiful buildings. Especially in Hanbok, which I highly recommend. It is up and down, so if you have knee problems it can be a little challenging. I had lunch at a great little restaurant and did some traditional sweet shopping. They have these lifesaver type lollies that whistle when you blow or suck through them. Entertaining and well annoying, but fun. I also did a Korean knot tying experience. It is really for beginners and available on a walk in basis. You get to choose from two types of bracelets, a key chain and two types of necklaces. Most of it is done for you, it is just a matter of choosing colours, and tying the macrame type knots. No Korean is needed as most have basic English. It was fun, but too simple for me. You can book a class for the more intricate knot projects. Which I will do next time. Just on the side, you sit on the ground, so with my dicky knees this was a little challenging. Also fun in Hanbok as it puffs out around you when seated.", February 2019
