0,5.0,"My favourite dept store in Seoul, Korea","Whenever I visit Seoul, this is where I go for foods, clothes, duty-free, etc.  They have the best items of all sorts and fun to browse here too.", November 2019
1,4.0,Shopping mecca in the heart of Myondgong,"During the festive period Shinsegae in Myeongdong is quite popular as they have extensive Christmas lighting all around the building, which looks quite pretty. There are two buildings, one more focused on high end brands and the other more focused on main stream brands. This department store is always busy because besides it's good selection and duty free area it is also nearby the heart of Myeongdong with all its shops and street food. So it is within easy walking distance and a good starting point to explore the area. It is also easy to reach with public transport.Within the department store there is a great food area in the basement as well as a restaurant floor with 5-6 restaurants, mainly Korean, whereas in the basement it is all kinds of foods.There are a couple of Shinsegae department stores in Seoul, this one and the one next to the Express Bus Terminal are the better ones.", December 2019
2,4.0,"Expensive, equivalent to Selfridges or Harrods",Huge store with everything high end you need.  Close to the markets and other big shops. We went yesterday it was packed. I thought the staff were quite rude when I asked for a specific product and the information desk was really unhelpful as the guy did not speak one word of English., December 2019
3,5.0,A surprisingly great place for food! ,"The good hall is connected to Hyewha underground and is brilliant! Shopping is very high end. Tax free floors are 8-12 (not very well advertised), but we found it overrated with not much bargains. Also they only accept USD in duty free and you need your passport (or photo of it) and flight details to buy.", November 2019
4,3.0,saks 5th of seoul,good meeting point. tours start in front (facing woori  bank) browse around.  enjoy a snack at the many coffee shops.  walk the perimeter to orient the shopping and landmarks., October 2019
5,5.0,Great place to visit for family!,"The food court at the basement is great! Clean and affordable price. Free WiFi, nice kids area at level 7. Wish the staff could be friendlier but my daughter was only playing as we couldn’t lug the toys back to sg. Nonetheless this was the mall we kept going back as is easy with kids!", October 2019
6,4.0,Nice Food Court,"If you’re into food then you might enjoy visiting here. They have food kiosks mainly korean, nice high end grocery, deli section with all sorts of cheese and cakes and sweets area.", September 2019
7,4.0,Typical Upscale Department Store,"A friend and I decided to check out this department store after looking around Namdaemun Market, where you can find just about anything you want and haggle over the cost. Shinsegae is at the other end of the spectrum, where designer merchandise prevails and prices remain fixed, unless a sale is on. Two buildings make up Shinsegae, the main and the new.We entered the smaller main building first. It holds a basement level and six floors. Labels include Rolex, Hermes, Saint Laurent, Celine and Balenciaga. The clothing, both Western and Korean brands, was beautifully displayed, with prices competitive with other major cities in the world. Sales reps occasionally asked if we needed assistance, but we were just browsing. I saw only a few customers in the building.Passageways in the basement and on the fourth and fifth floors connect with the new building, which has a basement level and 12 floors. The basement’s crowded Food Market and restaurants captured our interest as it was lunch time. We settled on Dean & DeLuca because we were in the mood for some Western food for a change and ate good sandwiches there.Brands in this building have a wider range of offerings, from Dior and Prada to New Balance and Calvin Klein. I saw many more customers here. The basement was jammed because of the time period and upper floors seemed to have serious shoppers, carrying a variety of bags.The new building caters to foreigners with duty free shopping available on floors 8-12 and a VIP Lounge for Foreigners on the 4th floor. There is interpretation service available in Chinese, English and Japanese at the first floor’s information desk.", November 2018
8,5.0,AMAZING spot if you're into fashion.,"I always laugh when I read reviews from people bashing a high end store for having high end items. If you can't roll with the big boys, stay on the porch. There's everything in here for every type of fashion you could want from minks to street wear. There's also a supermarket, street style food booths and other restaurants in the basement. If you've ever been to Harrod's, that's basically what this is. Well worth a visit if you're into fashion.", July 2019
9,3.0,Expencive shopping,"Visited the shopping mall in june 2019. Mostly expensive brands. Could also find shots like Nike and Adidas, but with quite high prices. Food court in the basement.", June 2019
10,3.0,Mainly high end product shopping,"If you are looking for luxury goods such as cosmetics, perfumes, handbags and clothes, you can come here and buy these products. They offer duty free if you bring your passport. This is well catered for Mainland Chinese tourists, since almost all the staff speak Putonghua.", June 2019
11,1.0,Horrendous service at airport duty free pick up,"Firstly, the level of service at the departmental store in Myeongdong wasn’t great. Bought a Tumi hand carry and due to bad command of English of the sales person, I became aware only after payment that I can only collect the bag in the airport. The first payment transaction had to to voided and a new charge had to be processed because the sales person made an error the first time around. Long story short, when I went to collect my bag in the airport on 27 May (approximately 9.30am) the lady that served me was rude beyond explanation. She handed the bag in a box to me and wanted me to sign off that the item was collected in good condition. I refused before inspecting the item. I asked for a cutter or scissors to open up the box, she lamely handed me and pen without uttering a single word. I asked if she expected me to unbox with a pen, she dropped the pen on the table and walked off! Such utter rudeness! If Korea wants to promote tourism, the country need to send its people fronting tourist for better training as such bad attitude in a place filled with tourists is just not acceptable! The picture below showed the unfriendly facial expression of the staff member manning the collection counter. Such a sight just put off the idea of me ever wanting to visit this country ever again. Extremely disappointed and upset with the horrendous encounter. Shinsigae, please send your staff for training so that they are more customer oriented.", May 2019
12,4.0,"High end store, and not much more to offer.","The main reason for visiting was to go to a family friends restaurant. It was quite confusing getting to the basement food court. Once you find it, the restaurants aren't clearly labeled. There is another doorway entrance that will lead you to the underground market which is not where you want to go. These are two separate places. The food court in the mall is within the mall. Yeah I know that is obvious. The mall itself is a high end mall with very expensive boutique stores. It is pretty clean and in an area that has a lot of traffic, as is with most places in Seoul. Unless you go to the back alleys. I got a sense of haughtiness and it wasn't very inviting. The service was kinda slow at the restaurant. I wouldn't go back to shop. I wouldn't go back to eat.", March 2019
13,5.0,Branded duty free,This place is first of have most of the branded high end quality product.It's packed with tourist .There is all Range products for kids and grown up.We enjoyed shopping here .Pop in early to avoid crowd ., April 2019

There are many international brands here as well as a good selection of Korean brands. A good place to get what you need including food stuff from the supermarket.", March 2019
15,4.0,Good underground food court,Food court is big and pretty nice.It's close from Myeongdong Street and Namdaemun Market. Crowded by many foreign tourists., March 2019
16,4.0,Traditional and Upmarket Department Store,"Back home in the UK traditional department stores are now rare, and only really found in large cities, perhaps due to our obsession with online shopping.  Here in Korea they seem to thrive and they really are very good.The Shinsegae Department Store, located near to the 'cosmetic quarter' is huge, an imposing and impressive building.  With 15 floors of goods and foods to browse, you really do need to know what you are looking for, otherwise you may need a search party to find you after a few hours.Decor is sleek, acres of marble and refined bling.  It really is quite an experience and well worth a trip.", February 2019
17,3.0,Nice big supermarket at the basement,"We took the subway from our hotel, Fraser Place Central and is just a few stops away. We entered into the basement area, and was surprised to see so many and trendy eateries. We stayed at one of the small cafe and had ice cream. Prices are definitely more expensive. A nice selection of food and they have so many floors.", February 2019
18,3.0,A regular department store ,"The usual - perfumes and cosmetics on the ground floor, mini high end food court and supermarket in the basement, brand names on the other floors. Nothing amazing.", February 2019
19,5.0,Beautiful luxurious mall!,I stayed at the Lotte Hotel which was about ten min walk from shinsegae dept store. Starting from the eighth floor it is duty free. There are a lot of luxury goods but for Hermès they don’t have bags and only comestics and stuff. It is a lovely mall! If you buy from the normal vendors the tax refund place is on the fourth floor with the sports wear stuff like adidas and Nike etc., January 2019
20,5.0,Great location,"Great location, walking distance from our hotel Ramada Hotel & Suites, near Myeondong and Nandaemun market.", December 2018
21,4.0,High end departmental store,"In every country, there is always this top end department store such as JC Penny in the US, Takashimaya in Japan, etc. Shinsegae is of similar concept in Seoul.", December 2018
22,4.0,This is a fairly large mall,This is a fairly large mall with the usual brands available as as well a supermarket and food hall.   It is similar to other Shinsegae Department Store throughout the country., December 2018
23,4.0,Lots of brands under one roof,"A major departmental store in Seoul, it houses a variety of luxury and average brands under one roof.  Not much bargains here if that's what you r looking for.", December 2018
24,4.0,Top class Shopping Mall,"I went to Shinsegae Department Store during my visit to Seoul in October 2018. It was a great shopping mall with world class boutiques and other high-end products. Unless you were looking for high-end products or boutiques like Louis Vuitton, etc, this is definitely not your place to shop.", October 2018
25,4.0,This is not a world class food hall,"We went primarily to go cosmetic and food hall shopping.The food hall is nice but in no way is world class when compared to the food halls of Japan. It’s like comparing LeBron James to a 4 foot tall high school basketball player in a wheelchair.There is a nice Korean bakery, nice fishcake shop, a few higher end pastries there, Royce’s chocolates were there too. The supermarket itself is mostly imports from Europe. None of the employees spoke enough English to help with detailed questions.I just was expecting more but was disappointed.", November 2018
26,5.0,"World-class food hall, the love-child of WHOLE FOODS and HARRODS GOURMET!","FOOD: To those foodies out-there who are also obsessed with supermarkets, farmers-markets, fish-markets, look no longer further. Because this underground supermarket is amazing and super chic. It's like a love-child between wholefoods + harrods food hall. Clean, tidy and well-aerated in the right way being too clinical. You still get the visceral experience of food-hunting. Local organic produces from Jeju like chesnuts, mandarins, grains and veg displayed are super enticing. Fish from its peninsular so fresh and glistening. Dried fish and orange shimps vacuumed packed. The seaweed section is the piece de la resistance! How do you choose from 4 shelves of seaweed???? Dried, shredded, salted, in sheets, chiffons, unsalted... There was not enough time to check out the cooked section but I did a 360 around all the international counters. The pizza Vietnamese and sushi counters piqued my interest. Sweets section had all the delightful packaged traditional goodies like bean paste or green tea flavoured treats. Also had chocolates and icecream from international brands. Decor: Relatively high ceiling space. It was dimly lit, but the warm lighting gives the belly of this place a sort of sexy vibe. Servce: amazing Korean ladies in the vegetable and seaweed section. They don't speak English. I was communicating in sign language. Nonetheless, they were so sweet and helped me select less ripened produces when I gave her - the airplane sign.Crowd: Well-heeled locals and couples.Price: pricyVerdict: when you feel lost in translation in Seoul, you can always find solace and food in here!", October 2018
27,4.0,Excellent food court,"Initially we thought this to be just another expensive high end department store, and it really is huge. But we discovered that the basement is a really huge and very nice food court selling all kinds of delicious foods and very classy. The prices here were not cheap but the food is well presented and very nice indeed.At the higher floor of the Shinsegae tower is a craft centre where we put our daughter to do some creative craft work which made this place even more of an interesting place. As for general shopping, we found the prices to be high but the choice to be very nice, good clothing brands and great products. But we do plan to visit here again especially for the food court and the craft centre.", July 2018
28,5.0,"If you like to shop, you need to check this out!","My wife and I like fashion, people watching, and shopping.  This place is freaking off the chain.  It is literally mind freaking blowing.  Nearly anything you want to find, this place will have it.  There is also some food an dining there, and it's top notch.  I'd totally go back again.", July 2018
29,5.0,"Go to the bottom, it’s awesome!","This store only carries high end goods, so if you are looking for a deal, this might not be the place for you. It is however extremely nice and everyone was very friendly. The bottom floor is where you need to go. That is where the food court is along with a nice grocery store. The food at the food court is as good as it gets! We had the best rice bowls there. We actually went back multiple times.", July 2018
30,3.0,EXPENSIVE!,"Unless you are looking for expensive stuff, this is not for you. It's a regular mall with branded goods and for some reason, they don't have a handful of newborn stuff like breastpumps etc. Their infant selection are very limited as well. You can come here if you want to chill or get some warmth haha But really, if you are into cheaper stuff, you might as well go somewhere else.", April 2018
31,5.0,Great for all things you need,"Shinsegae does not disappoint for the shopping experience. The basement food floor is amazing, and you can get just about any brands / items that you need on the others. I needed shoes urgently and ended up buying two pairs from Kumkang on the third floor. Tbh i was blown away by the service the staff were polite, friendly and gave me free gifts too! Tip - dont forget to ask for tax refund, you have to go to the customer service office on the 4th floor.", August 2018
32,5.0,Food court reminds me of the Plaza in New York,"I love the food court and market isn’t this department store.High quality foods... looks like the Plaza Hotel in NYC. Discovered delicious naengmyun which is made of fish brothI think and fish. It is low to medium spicy and they serve dumplings. It was very delicious I went back twice. Noodles are created al dente.The market reminds me kind of like Bristol Farms and a reserved version of Whole Foods.The food court serves Italian, several variations of Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese and sushi, etc.There is even a Dean and Deluca!!!-For duty free shopping, they have a really high end haute couture section as well as floors 8-13(?) in the main section. If you buy anything 30,000W or more in the regular section... you can get your tax back on the 4th floor next to the New Balance store.There was a great pajama section for kids, with reasonably priced sets fabricated of cotton and natural fabrics.", August 2018

34,2.0,Such horrible service ,"This is for the branch at Myeongdong.At the balenciaga boutique - the service was horrid.A young woman was there, on the telephone, and refused to reply when I asked her if there was menswear and men’s bags. I literally stood in front of her waiting for her to finish her phone call and asked her which branch sold menswear.She replied: No. and went back to her call.I asked if she understood English, she glanced back at me and said: Yes.And turned away back to her back office.Lucky she was the only one like this. All other sales people I encountered in Seoul were amazing.", July 2018

36,3.0,Upscale shopping but be aware of the process!,"I've never shopped at a duty free department store, so it's my ignorance that I didn't know that you don't get the goods right then UNLESS it's manufactured/sold by a Korean company. But even buying Korean goods is a hassle. For example,when buying a  Kakao Ryan backpack, I needed to provide my passport AND return boarding pass. The employees I found to be very brusque and even surly and unhelpful. Will not go back.", July 2018
37,5.0,Great shopping and excellent service ,"Compared to other high end department stores in the area, we felt more shopaholic here. The staff are friendly, more attentive and more welcoming. The selections are well curated. Promotion on some of the items were so good, you need to be mindful because it's so easy to overspend. Overall, I had such a fund time shopping!", May 2018

41,4.0,Not keen on Namdaemun-ro street food the try Shinsegae food court,"After spending Sunday morning wandering after through Namdaemun market, my son wanted to have lunch in Shinsegae Dept store. On the basement level of Shinsegae’s main store in downtown Seoul is a food street of many private and locally well known restaurants and food shops. The decor is refined and the food stores are open chef kitchen style. My sons vegetarian so we shared an Indian vegetable curry and fresh cooked naan set from Agra.Prices are a little bit higher but so is the decor and ambience.The food street meanders through the basement level and is quite busy and bustling during meal times.

47,4.0,Dont forget passport!!,Wanted to get some luxury bags in Shinsaegae but i did not bring my passport. It was the requirement to show our passport for:1. Identification purpose to have a tax free purchase2. To key in our details and they would ask u for your outbound flight number (remember your flight number!)3. Because our goods purchased are to be collected at the airport upon our outbound flight. They needed the passport to verify in store and in the airport.The lady allowed me to show a picture of my passport but unfortunately i didnt keep it in my mobile. So yeah i walked back to my hotel to get it. Remember bring passport with you if you are on a shopping spree in Seoul, December 2017

49,5.0,Shopping Heaven for Shopholic!,"This is the place for people like me....shopholic with a style. You can get lots of branded goods at a good price especially at their duty free floors. However, take note that you can only collect the items purchased at the airport upon your departure date.

55,4.0,Lovely department store and great food court with not too expensive price,Food court is really lovely in Sinsegae.

56,4.0,... but expensive,"When you want to buy luxury, this may be the shopping place. At least 3 floors for duty free buying.

59,4.0,Nice and big - good food court and a great roof terrace,"After checking out the huge Lotte Dept. Store we had a look around here. Lotte was ok with a fine food court. But Shinsegae beats Lotte clearly. Everything looks a bit cleaner, a bit better, a bit more professional. There's a big selection for clothes, kitchenware and electronics. But some stuff has crazy high prices. Then - like Lotte - there's the huge Duty Free Section with some good deals (especially on Korean Snacks).The real highlight for us was the lovely food court (with a nice luxury supermarket with fresh fish, seafood and meat). Nice little restaurants and food stalls. Try the Al Tang “Korean Hot Spicy Fish Roe Soup at the Sushi Bar!Besides that don't miss out on the lovely rood terrace. It's an actual small park with some fountains and lots of green. And even some cherry blossoms! Great if you wanna catch a quick breath from all the shopping.

Shinsegae has duty free shops and many other shops which sell things you can buy. I myself did not buy anything here, better shop at the markets which are affordable for me.I had dinner with friends here at one of Korean cuisine restaurants. I forgot the name.

We went for the Korean food. Ate at 2 Korean food stalls, sharing the food so we could eat more variety. Menus have English description with pictures. At one stall we ate a spicy octopus rice.

69,4.0,Lotte Department Store is Better,"This is still a good department store, I just feel that if you got to Lotte Main Department store, I don't see why you'd need to go here.

70,5.0,De Moon Korean restaurant at the shopping mall,"There are a few eateries in the department store and most of them look good - once you find them, that's it!There is an ""interactive"" map on each floor, using which you can locate your destination - once you located English button on it :)The 5F, where most of the eateries are, is reached via 4th floor walkway. The place isn't overcrowded, and you are served very promptly. The menu available in English, but there are only names of the dishes - and you have to guess what's in them! On some level, it makes ordering great fun, but if you decide to forgo the element of surprise, there is a waiter/waitress who could try to explain some basics (and they are literally basics!): pork/beef/chicken/no meat/ that's good/that's very good. After that - go for it, because the meals are fun. I tried ""medicinal red ginseng chicken soup"" only to discover that:The delicious broth also contains oysters (those allergic to seafood - beware!), the chicken is actually a whole poussin, AND the poussin is stuffed with rice, ginseng, garlic, and dried fruit. The result is delicious, filling, but doesn't make you too heavy. The cost is 25000 KWR. The hot stone bibimbap is also worth the try - it is straight forward to mix, very fresh, and the result is delicious. The restaurant has a decent wifi (this is a rarity!), the seats are comfortable and the staff is polite.", May 2016

72,4.0,Huge department store with duty free shopping,"This main store is located within 15mins from Myeongdong station and one practically find almost anything in this building. The immediate duty free shopping is located from the 8th floor. The lower levels provide tax refunds for tourists. If you're looking for luxury goods from international brands, this is the place to go! However, as some stores have not yet open, there's a limited selection of goods.The ladies beauty zone (on the 8th or 9th floor, I forgot), can be a real test of your determination! The salespeople are very aggressive and before you know, you might have spent a sum! You've been warned, but still a great place to get your tax free items..", May 2016
73,4.0,Luxury all the way,"Was visiting the Namdaemun market just behind the Shinsegae Main store.Stark contrast between upper class shopping and low mid class just a street across.Posh marque cars line the street outside Shinsegae.  Step into the mall and you feel you're in another zone altogether.This is luxury mall if you can afford it.

77,3.0,Everything under one roof,"Went to this and another store and it was mostly high-end shopping with brands such as LV, Gucci, Coach etc being prominently displayed.While my wife browsed the ladies' clothing and cosmetics departments,  I had a rather enjoyable time checking out the supermarket and food areas, where they literally have everything from ripened huge strawberries to sundried fish, as well as mentaiko (fish roe) to kimchi and wagyu beef.There was also a great variety of breads, cakes and cheeses.  They did not provide samples, unfortunately, but they were well packaged and packed so that you can buy some for your long plane journey home, if needed.", March 2016
78,5.0,very fashionable,a lot of good selected shops and boutiques in this department. enjoy shopping and just watching around for hours., March 2016
79,4.0,My wife really loved it here,"It seemed to me like a Macy’s in New York without all of the glittering decorations. he department store had American Music, all of the advertisements had American girls and every store could be found in America. I have some allergies to perfume and this place really had such a strong perfume smell because of all the samples being given out and placed on potential customers. The prices on cosmetics were pretty good according to my wife even though I find the duty free at the airports cheaper. I liked that you can show your passport and get a rebate on the taxes you paid so that was pretty cool except for we were with our in laws and they know how to do that. Had I been by myself there would be no way I could have done that because you have to go across the street then down some escalator to like a secret passage that it wouldn’t be worth my trouble. The place made my wife happy so I’m ok with that.", February 2016

82,4.0,Beautiful Christmas decoration and Great Shopping Experience,"Whenever I am in Seoul, I will go and visit Shinsegae Department store. I like to shop at their super market and also have meals at their food level. This is because the environment is peasant and food is of quality Service is good.'This time, I saw the beautiful lighting outside its store and took some picture. Recommend to those who does not want to in a compact rush for Duty free shopping.Their Cosmetic level and Clothing level is interesting ( even if you dont intend to buy ) browsing through add some fashion inspiration to you on what are the trends of the working executives in Seoul.", November 2015
83,1.0,Bad attitude,Sorry to say this. Never saw such behaviour to customers such that. I have been to more than 40 countries. My wife choosed 5 leather handbags went to the cashier to pay and they refused letting her pay without the passport. At the same time all customers pays normally. As tourist we never carry passports while shopping majority of tourists leave passports in hotel room right! My wife showed her official identity card. But still the cashier refused a supervisor came to help but still the cashier lady refused! Can any one tell me what thats means at front of all other customers. The other thing non of them speaks a single word in english., October 2015
84,5.0,"Seoul's answer to Neiman, Saks, Bergdorf, etc",High end shopping lives at the Shinsegae Main department store.  I was impressed at the depth of every high end brand represented at this store., April 2015
85,3.0,It's ok,Not my favourite shopping location in Seoul.  Found it a little more difficult to navigate.  Has two buildings - one is more high end.  In the end it is shopping and I am usually forced to go, August 2015
86,4.0,"If You Like Department Stores, Add A Star!","The Shinsegae location in Busan is larger (in fact, it's the Largest Department Store in the World), but this one's big enough to be getting along.If you love the experience of, say, Harrod's in London, the Galeries Lafayette of Paris, or Milan's Corso Como, this is for you. It's a comparable experience. Mega-sized, with high-end offerings around every corner, it is fun to explore and get lost amidst an ocean of stuff.Staff are friendly and accommodating, and probably keenly aware that most of us aren't really here to buy much.Recommended for everyone… Highly Recommended, if this is your kind of place.", November 2014
87,5.0,Shinsegae Department Stores care for their Foreign Customers!,"Over the years I have been living and working in Korea I have found Shinsegae staff consistently courteous, attentive and helpful at every one of their stores I have visited in Seoul. Even though many staff don't speak English they always spare no effort listening to me and trying to understand what it is I am asking about. I have always left the store feeling satisfied with the customer service I have received. Yes, I know their prices are high but the prices are equally high but without the customer service at the other ""big name"" stores in Seoul in my experience!In contrast I dread asking staff anything, even the price in English at E mart (same company as Sinsegae) or Hyundai stores - the usual reply is ""sorry, no English"" or ""obsoyo"" and then staff quickly move away and ""disappear"" so they don't have to serve me.Yesterday I visited Shinsegae's main store in Myeongdong hoping to get help to buy an armchair using a Shinsegae/Emart gift voucher I had been given. I had had a very bad experience two days previously at Yeoju Emart where the armchair was not in stock and where I was trying to purchase the chair which was available at another Emart store too far away from Yeoju for me to carry and transport home on the bus myself.At Shinsegae I explained my predicament, the store attendant immediately asked me to wait a minute please while he called a staff member who could speak English. The customer attention I received was productive and pleasant. After discussion and phone calls the staff found a way for me to purchase the armchair which was available on the online Shinsegae Mall after I converted my gift voucher into Shinsegae points (I hold a member's card). The points were used to purchase the item. The whole process was rather complex because I did not have an ID or password so in fact to organise, it took considerable time and effort on the part of the staff member and the ladies in the Customer Service Department.As per my initial comment, in my experience the staff at Shinsegae Stores are prepared to ""go the extra mile"" to help their non-Korean-speaking customers, something I highly commend them for and I really appreciate. I went home a very happy, satisfied customer!I recommend other non-Korean-speakers to shop at Shinsegae for excellent customer service and I hope other foreigners likewise have similar good experiences shopping at Shinsegae.", July 2015
88,4.0,Mall o' Korea,"If you enjoy capitalism, like you should. This mall in the proximity of the Namdaemun market is something to check out. Layer after layer of consumer goods, lights, glitz, with restaurants at the top of the building. If you like European cars, just stand on the street outside and watch 'em roll on up.", June 2015
89,4.0,Head straight to the Food Hall! You can skip the rest.,"I’m not sure about the other cities, but in both Seoul and Busan, Shinsegae comes in the form of a multi-level shopping complex selling everything from clothes to homeware to… my focus – food.

90,4.0,Another huge luxury shopping mall,"Quite similar to other department store such as Lotte, this store also carries luxury brands. Located near to Namdaemun Market.", January 2015
91,4.0,Impressive and opulent store,"What an impressive site as you approach Shinsegae.  The main store, the flagship of the chain is truly a landmark in downtown Seoul.  Located in the Myeong-dong area the beautiful structure emits an air of style, class and historic culture.  Best way to reach it is by metro light blue line 4.  Take exit 5 and walk forward.  You will see the beautiful building facing you.  Shinsegae which means ""new world"" is noted for its luxury goods with all brand names represented in the store.  My main reason in visiting was to see what was offered in the basement, usually the spot for food items and supermarket.  Not to be disappointed it was super clean, orderly and well laid out for viewing, shopping and gawking.  The products were of very high caliber as evidenced by the prices.  Does $10.00 for an apple tell you anything.  It really is eye popping to see the array of cooked and packaged goods.  It is mouth watering.  There is a supermarket and also many mini counters selling ever item imaginable.  Some of the bakeries were fabulous.  Even if you are not in the buying mood it is quite an experience to see how the rich shop.  I was somewhat disappointed, because having been in Lotte, this area was much smaller, plus I could not locate a sit down restaurant like in Lotte.  It does not compare to the size and quantity of goods available in Lotte.  It is definitely worth visiting and experiencing it.  But if time is limited, then I would most definitely visit Lotte for the shear size and scope of the area.", June 2014
92,5.0,Hidden Gem in the Hectic & Stressful City Life,"The most luxury department store. Two wings. One wing for super luxury and the other for normal luxury. Worth to visit and see what it offers, but please note you'd feel odd if you are not well presented. Also, please make sure you visit TRINITY GARDEN on the top of department store. My friend took me here for lunch break. I never wanted to disclose this place to anyone as it's just a perfectly hidden gem in the city. Quite classy, stylish lavish cafe with high quality food and beverages to the richer. You'd feel quite odd when you are not presented properly not only in the garden but also in this part of department store. Four major artworks would obviously make you feel privileged as well. Absolutely stunning merchandising and promotional stuff overwhelm you. Very lavish life style for the richer but good to catch up with global trend. Not a place you take your kids. Not a place you'd casually and uninhibitedly visit and enjoy, but obviously much better than any other department stores if you'd like to buy any luxury goods.", April 2014
93,4.0,Classy,"My main purpose in visiting Shinsegae was not to splurge on the global brand name products available, but to view the well-reviewed Trinity Garden on the department store's top floor.The department store itself is a class act. Obviously catering to the rich and richer, here you find the world's luxury brands like Prada and Louis Vuitton. It does not have a big area by any means but rather slim, probably owing to the expensive land on which it is located. However, this is one beautiful interior, with marbles and an air of sophistication throughout. True to a store of this sort, it was very quiet when I visited, so it was good to escape from the crowds in Myeongdong to spend a few minutes window shopping here.The Trinity Garden, while small with only 4-5 main sculptures, was most pleasant on a sunny day. I took some good photos. The cafe there looked inviting but I did not have enough time to try it out.", May 2014
94,5.0,A feast for the eyes,Simple floor layout with excellent visual merchandising and promotional materials. A wide variety of international and local labels for shoppers to choose from. Those hungry after some splurging can fuel up with the huge food selection in the basement., May 2014
95,5.0,just wow!,Shinsegae Deptmartment store in Myeongdong might have been the best shopping day i have experienced. Not only because of the endless high end designers but the service of the workers are unbelievable. One worker who works for Dior Sunglasses truly made my shopping experience at Korea one that i would never forget. Not only did she took me by suprised by speaking in English but she might have been the sweetest and nicest person i have ever met. Truly amazing., May 2014
96,5.0,Finest and Best,"Easily the finest and best high street shopping experience in Seoul. Spread across two stores, New building(12 floors) and the main building(6 floors). Has all the major fashion brands under one roof. Truly amazing. As always the duty free floor is flooded with Chinese shoppers. The basement food court is good. The authentic Korean restraurants in 10th floor is very tasty but expensive. Worth visiting for the experience.", February 2014
97,4.0,Upmarket Shopping Centre,Shinsegae Dept Store is one of the upmarket shopping centre in central Seoul.

99,5.0,World Class Food Hall,"Go to Shinseage just for the food halls - totally amazing high end market and a couple dozen specialty kiosks selling all kinds of yummies.  There are also a couple of places where you can buy food to sit down and eat there.  An amazing sushi bar.  As someone else said here, definitely the Harrod's of the 21st century.Beware though, they don't like you to take photos of the cooks preparing some of the specialty Korean items.", February 2013

101,4.0,Just another big departmental store,There are 2 levels dedicated to duty free shopping which is packed with people mainly the mainlanders. They are buying everything. Price wise is not that attractive. I probably could get similar price locally., October 2012
102,5.0,The Finest Mall Experience!,Could've christened it the 21st Century Harrods of Korea! What a superlative experience it is to spend time in this mall . . . Right from the parking attendants in their tailcoats to the concierge service inside is truly outstanding., March 2012
103,4.0,Good Restaurants Upstairs,"One of the best restaurants in Seoul for kalbi-tang is on the 10th floor.  They have a nice coffee shop on the main shopping floor, you can purchase pastries as well.  You can satisfy your western craving for bread products as well - a couple of good bakeries which sell whole-wheat bread, muesli buns, good selection of imported jams, etc.  Ladies, if you are anything more than a US size 6-8, forget about finding any clothing here that fits.  Go downstairs to the market and you'll have many choices.  I always purchase traditional Korean cookies/sweets for my friend's mother, a Korean lady in her 90s when I am there.  The store itself if spotlessly maintained, and a nice reprieve for a coffee, cake and or bread purchase when you are in the area.", November 2011
104,5.0,Restaurants on the 10F are excellent!,Having family in Seoul is a plus because they know where the high quality but reasonably priced restaurants are.  The 10F of the Shinsegae department store near Namdaemun is one of them.  I have had the occasion to try a few of them but the one that stands out is the sushi restaurant on the 10F--not only will you get fresh and authentic sushi but the price for what you get is outstanding.  There are many choices of cuisines and it's a nice place to take a break between shopping at Namdaemun.  We thoroughly enjoyed our sushi meal and will return for some more when back in Seoul., September 2012
105,3.0,Upmarket mall - very expensive,"Go to this store if you want to purchase high-end fashion and accessories at a high-end price. It is just a huge department store, nothing special, unless you go to the one in Busan in the South of Korea, which is recorded as the World's Biggest Department Store. If you do go there show your foreign ID at the information desk to get a coupon booklet, then purchase any item, even something small from the supermarket and take the docket back to the counter & you will receive a free quality shopping bag. Also a must in this store in Busan is to go to the 9th floor restaurant and eat 'Blowfish' and live to talk about it. Perhaps the store in Seoul gives the bag & has a 'Blowfish' restaurant too, worth it to check, if you are interested!", September 2012
106,4.0,"If you have money to burn, this is the place","Expensive high-end del. store in central Seoul, filled to the brim with anything from fashion to cutlery. You can find almost anything fashionable here and the staff are very helpful, even without speaking English (as they should be with these prices. At the top of the building there is a lovely, zen-like garden/sitting area, where you can bring your ice cream (that you can also buy in Shinsegae) and sit and watch the skies or the view of Seoul. The view is not Sky Tower quality, but ok.Short of it: if you have money to burn, this is e place. It's huge though, so prepare to spend some time here.", August 2011
107,4.0,Small sizes only,"If you've got money to burn and you're a very small size, then Shinsegae is for you. But if you're normal western size and on a budget then don't bother. Unless you go to visit the candy store Weeny Beeny....mmmmm!!", June 2012
108,4.0,Huge upscale mall,This mall is huge and very upscale.  Take a trip to the bottom level for a snack.  Walking around took forever but the sights were pleasing.  The clothing displays were very nice and I found a dress that's out of this world.  Ca't wait to wear it., May 2012
