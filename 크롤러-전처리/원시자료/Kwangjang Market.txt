Not sure who is buying the clothes on sale but the food stalls definitely attract lots of customers.  Just need the guts to sit down at one of the places and give the offerings a try.

I was not even brave enough to sit at the same table with them. I did try their famous pancakes from one of their vegetarian stalls and was mildly impressed. The best find for me in this market was their donuts. The line was long but moved fast. They could not make them fast enough. My family went back for seconds. If you are ever in this market go for the freshly made donuts (its soaped long instead of round), the taste is worth every calorie. You can watch it being made as well. Priced moderately.", September 2019

Here you will find many street food classics such as mung bean pancakes, Korean blood sausage, dumplings, steak tartare, fresh octopus and many others. All menus are in English, I don‚Äôt see why you would book a tour to come here to eat - read up on the Korean street food dishes and venture out on your own - I met several nice Koreans as I was hoping from stall to stall who was very friendly and wanted to share their food culture and their Soju with a total stranger.

34,5.0,Just as good on a second visit,Street food in abundance. Live fish for sale and local delicacies (unidentifiable to me). Sitting at a stall or one of the rooms is probably better than getting a take-away as the 'to go' option involves a lot of plastic and polystyrene packaging., August 2019
35,4.0,interesting place to visit,worth a visit to check out the food. didn‚Äôt spend that much time here but my favourite stall was the kalguksu (knife-cut wheat flour noodles in soup) and mandu (dumplings) stall made famous by the netflix street food show (happy to report that it is worth the hype and the possible wait for seats as it‚Äôs now a hot spot for foreigners thanks to the show). it‚Äôs also a good place to shop for fabrics if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for!, September 2019

45,5.0,I had a blast ,"This place is a must see to in my book. I had a Seoul Korean native who lived in the States for 25 years give me a tour after moving back to Seoul for the past 11 years. Took me places that tourist would NEVER see and many Koreans don‚Äôt even know about it. This was one of his stops and gave me the history of the Market and how it grew and expended over decades. This is the largest traditional Korean markets and is known for food, silk and anything you want to find. You can also book a tour through TripAdvisor", July 2019
46,1.0,very disappointed,"Went with my brother to have a good experience as seen online. One of the food stall owners was very pushy and persuaded us to sit down after saying she'd give us ""service"" (free food). We ate some and asked if we could take the rest of the food away as we wanted to leave quickly, still thinking it was ""service"". Also important to note I spoke Korean though I'm not 100% fluent. I was quite naive, and at this point she added more food that we didn't ask for. I then asked how much this would all be(as it was a lot for free food) and she told me it was 16,000won. I then felt pressured into paying because she purposefully gave us a lot of food without asking. The stall owner was very old and our Korean wasn't good enough to argue with her. My brother was also feeling sick. At the time, there were a lot of people as well as the weather being very rainy and humid, so we just wanted to get away as soon as possible. Make sure to be very firm with what exactly you want to eat and always ask straightaway as to how much the food will be or make sure that the food is still ""service"" if offered.", July 2019

For me, all the food looks alike but obviously some are better than others as they are very busy and others have no customers.

The shop keepers are very friendly and welcoming and can speak a multitude of languages ranging from english, chinese and japanese, so communication really shouldn't be a problem no matter where you're from. All the food is fresh or made on the spot and you can see them prepare it. You can either take away the food or sit down at the stalls themselves to enjoy the food items. Price wise, it isn't expensive at all and you are utterly spoiled for choice of what to eat at Gwangjang market. There is a lot to see and observe and is a definite must-see location when in Seoul.

Love the dumplings from one stall right at the end of the food alley. Many aunties are selling similar food but depending solely on each skill to attract patrons.   The other alley are stalls selling korean costumes and modern clothings.  You should bargain, but not too much.

The fried pancake filled with pork, sold right in the crux of the market was delicious.

At another stall, we ate a honey pancake. Delicious! Walked around for a couple of hours, including across the street where there are many climbing gear shops. Expensive, but fun to browse. One even serves beer and coffee. Look for the one called ‚Äúmygear‚Äù. Vas‚Äôs beer in a 16 oz glass is 3000 won. Coffee made to order. Very nice host.

The buffet breakfast in our stomachs allowed us to take our time watching what eateries the locals were patronizing. They know what's good, so I'm following them. Obviously, we can't read Korean, so I just took pictures (see attached). The best pancakes seemed to be the one with the orange sign (says since 1994). We sat in front on the benches with tables, enjoyed our 4000 Won pancake while watching customers go in & out of the dine-in restaurant. Plus, many locals were buying takeaway plastic containers of uncooked pancake mix. Amazing, it's that popular! Then 2 different stall owners told us to eat the 2500 Won Japchae (transparent noodles with sesame oil and soy sauce) from this lady at stall #41. We just sat on stools holding our plates and watched this endless line of folks buying the 3 things they sold. We were also impressed how the 2 ladies left their money sitting in 2 bowls for all to see and everyone stayed honest!", November 2018

Vendor after vendor, of seafood, fried food, vegetables, street food, etc.. I was in heaven. The stalls were pretty repetitive, but there is still a huge selection. I tried a few fried items first, delicious. After browsing the stalls I sat at one and ate a bowl of fresh Bibimbap. The bowl was filling and very affordable. The market itself was crowded obviously in the evenings, but there is plenty of room to look, sit, and eat! I recommend coming here for lunch or dinner at least once during a stay just to sample a variety of food items.", October 2018

125,5.0,Go for the raw beef!  Really!  ,"This enormous market is an absolute must visit when you‚Äôre in Seoul.  The market sells goods and foods and this review will focus on the foods.  First, it would be impossible to do this market justice by any single review.  One could spend a month here and still not discover all that it offers.  I was interested in trying Korean beef tatare.  I found my way to ‚Äúraw beef alley‚Äù and picked a place.  The beef here is delivered each morning and is of the highest quality and freshness.  I tried my dish with a chopped live baby octopus on top.  Most westerners may balk at the dish when they see the chopped tentacles moving about on top of a mound of bright red raw beef.  Break the egg yolk on top and dig in!  I guarantee it will be one of the most delicious dishes you have ever tasted.  If you eat sushi and like your steak rare, then it‚Äôs not much of a step to eat Korean beef tartare and live baby octopus.", November 2018

A section of the market is dedicated to street food capably managed uniformly by older ladies who do not shy from fighting for your business. 3 items are ubiquitous‚Äî Korean sausage made of pork blood and sticky rice, japche stir fried yam noodles and vegetables, and rice cakes.

142,3.0,Overwhelming but still good to visit ,"Lots of vendors selling fabrics, clothes and food.  Pretty intense and overwhelming inside.  Food stalls were all the same.  Sellers were very pushy.  If you stop to look, they automatically try to hand you a menu and make you sit.  We had to keep on walking so that we wouldn‚Äôt feel pressured to buy, which didn‚Äôt allow us to focus much.  Once we decided to stop at one of the stalls and try out the pancakes, they brought out 2 when we only wanted one so we ended up having to pay for both.  Felt a little tricked because we‚Äôre foreigners.  Wanted to look at fabrics, but every time we would stop to check them out, we would get harassed by the sellers and when we‚Äôd decide not to buy, they‚Äôd get upset and start becoming unfriendly.  It got frustrating a bit.  We did checked out one souvenir shop where the seller was a very nice sweet older man.  Overall, it was an interesting place to see.

162,5.0,Must do when in Seoul,"Loved this place. Sights sounds and smells really make you come alive. The food was the main attraction for ourselves and this is in the centre of the market. Make time however,  to take in the fish, spice, kimchi and textile stores on route. There is a massive choice of places to eat, with each type of speciallity seeming to have the same location with different stall traders servicing the same option in each area. Prices are clearly shown and standard across the piece. Not as cheap as I expected but still much better than western prices. We chose to have just one type of dish (portion ) at each stall so we could try as many things as we could before getting full. Mung bean pancakes were our fav!4000 a portion. Bibimbap 5000 was really good. Fish cakes in a soup were nice at 3000. Sundae a blood sausage filled with spiced sweet rice were fantastic, they are served with cooked liver which reminded me of my child hood 6000. Bottled water is provided free - one central bottle from which you fill your own cup. Alternatively look for stores on the side selling Cass beer in small cans for 2000.

Gwangjang was among the most frenetic, crowded and dirty of them.  We were not inspired to eat there. Instead, we were more comfortable with the street food in Myeongdong.  I'm sure this is an instance of a difference in Western and Asian sensibilities, but I feel that Western tourists should be made aware that Gwangjang is not like anything you would be used to in the West.", June 2018
