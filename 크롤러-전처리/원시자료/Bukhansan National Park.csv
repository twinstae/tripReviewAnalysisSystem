0,5.0,Superb! Chose your level,"Amazing place we wanted to do it for fun enjoying and we asked at the entrance the forest Guard what to do. I ll add the map and the beautiful pictures of the temple there. A big harder at the end for non sportive but OK. Something to do for the view of the city from there, the rock and the temple. In Feb it was peaceful with a bit of snow there but really something to do.", February 2020
1,5.0,"Easy hike, safe for solo hiker.","It is a relatively easy hike even for those without hiking experience. The trails is easy to navigate, it should take not more than 6 hours (return trip) for beginners. The only difficult part is near the peak due to steep climb. Went there in late October when the leaves started to turn red and yellow. It was very windy at the peak, I'd suggest to bring extra layer of cloth for comfort. Although I hiked alone, I wasn't lonely because along the way, there were many people (especially friendly ahjummas) offered me food and started a conversation despite the language barrier.", October 2019
2,5.0,great escape from the city,"great hiking and scenery. Peaceful. AFAIK, it's a completely healthy and wholesome day out in nature.", February 2020
3,5.0,Well worth checking out,I arrived into Seoul at the New Year celebrations and found that the transport was fully booked and everything in Seoul would be closed. the lady at the hotel recommend this place. I went more for something to do while waiting for my flight the next day but was so pleasantly surprised. Its a beautiful National Park with really really nice hiking. The top rock scrambling is also fun if you aren't afraid of heights. it ended up being one of the highlights of my trip! If you like nature then I really recommend it., February 2020
4,5.0,One of best trekking trails,"Four of us took subway and continued with bus to the place. We overestimated that it is easy trail but the fact very tough in cold and partly snow which made it slippery. The best trail we had with scenery, stones, frozen rivers and finally we reached Bogungmun gate one of the castleâ€™s gates. Another tough and different going down and took us 5 hours to complete.", January 2020
