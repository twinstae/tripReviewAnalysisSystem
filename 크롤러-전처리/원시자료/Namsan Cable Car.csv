0,4.0,Beautiful Seoul skyline,"On our last day in Seoul, we went up to Namsam Tower via Cable Car during winter. It takes 10 minutes. Luckily not many people we were able to enjoy the evening and night views of Seoul sky line.  Of course the attraction were the love locks, sadly there were signs telling", January 2020
1,4.0,Namsan Seoul Tower,It was a challenge walking from the Myeongdong subway station up the slope to the cable car base station amidst the cold December winter. The cable car ride to the Tower was great but make sure you get a vantage point (ideally facing front) in order to view the great scenery as the cable car brings you up to the tower. The view of the setting sun atop the hill is beautiful. The love padlocks area is overly populated; thanks to all the lovely people. There are restaurants where you can enjoy a good meal while admiring the beautiful view., December 2019
2,1.0,Worst  SERVICE ,"Great view but NOT RECOMMENDED FOR FAMILY WITH BABIES AND KIDS. Definitely not recommend for family with babies or kids. They only allows one person have the priority to take the lift, but what happen to the other family member????? They just waited for another 30 mins there for other family to come up???????And the staff even commented: oh there’s other babies too. Seriously???? There’s only kids that able to walk but not with a crying baby..... and it’s in winter!!!!!!!! THIS IS JUST SUPER DUMB AND RIDICULOUS!", December 2019
3,4.0,Interesting View,"The Namsam cable car ride provides a very interesting and great view of Seoul.  Its a short ride to the top of the hill but really enjoyed the view, you can take a round trip ride but I think going back is better if you walk down the hill to really enjoy the view for you can stop and take some more pictures.", December 2019

5,5.0,Good ride,The ride in Namsan cable car provide a great view of Seoul when you are riding up and down.  Would suggest to take the cable car during night as the view is great., November 2019
6,4.0,Wonderful view of the city,This cable car ride ends with a beautiful view of old and new seoul.  It's  a shirt 3 minute ride but the niew from the top is beautiful., October 2019
7,5.0,"Few hours to kill, nothing better.","Enjoyed the trip to Seoul Tower via cable car. Likely queueing for cable car but moves well and will let you know queueing time when purchasing ticket. Lovely views of the city, clear blue sky’s. If traveling with partner bring a lock!", October 2019
8,3.0,Short,Shortest way to reach namsan park or tower is to use the cable car. It's a short ride to the top of the hill., September 2019
9,2.0,Expensive and not worth it,Short ride and nothing to see. Yet we paid so much. Disappointed....Truly disappointed with the experience. Better to take a bus or taxi up than the cable car., July 2019
10,4.0,Good but loads of people to a car,We thought the easiest and most fun way of getting to the top of the hill and the tower! They do cram you in but it’s ok you can still move at least to bring your arms up to take a photo. The views are cool enough. They have windows just around the top half of the car., June 2019
11,1.0,Disappointing and Expensive,"I took the cable car down with my 3 year old son (we walked up), and we looked forward to the views, but the queues are long, the staff are pretty rude, and you’re rammed in to the cars. It’s pure luck if you’re next to a window with enough room to get your camera out and take a photo. It’s definitely not worth the money (everyone over 3 pays). The walk up was really lovely - even on a warm-ish day in late May. There are also several buses that run you up to the Tower, which I’d definitely recommend over the cable car. I wish we’d walked back down.", May 2019
12,4.0,Sum up of seoul city! Read till end for surprise:),"You probably see a lot reviews saying packed cable car, can't see much etc. Well cause you expecting it at the wrong place!Not there yet.. The aim getting Namsan Cable Car is to reach at the top, Namsan Tower. And it is fine if you can hardly see the view along the way cause the best view is on the top later!  Breathtaking view and have few fav spots for your instagram feed. hehe. Got convenience store, cafe & souvenir shops too upthere. But i suggest you can packed your own sandwich then. save! haha.Tips: Personally I highly suggest you guys to buy one way ticket. Go for a walk when going down from the top. Another forgetful view and hidden insta spots beside the love locks.LOL. thank me later!", February 2019
13,4.0,Worth the visit on a sunny spring day ,"Gone up and down the hill by cable car. They charge a small fee to use it which was all acceptable. We booked a return so we could also get back down. The cabin was not air conditioned and they stuff quite a lot of ppl into the cabin. But it’s only a 3 min ride. We didn’t have to Quere please note this. Up the hill there are love locks - like the ones in Paris where u can leave a message and then seal it at the fence. Nice idea . You can Bring your pwn lock or buy one locally. You find the tower, food and drinks nice views over the city and some shows up there. Well worth the visit!Definitely recommend!!", April 2019
14,4.0,Bonding time with my family,"First time in this place, and we finally get to see all these padlocks that we see in a lot of k-dramas. Perfect cool weather this time of the year!", April 2019
15,2.0,Not an option,"Pay 7$ just to be pressed inside the cabin with lots of people after a big line to enter. You can hardly move, forget about taking photos. My advice is to take a bus (see on naver map: 02, 03, 05) to get there, they're going from all main places nearby, it's cheaper and even more comfortable.", April 2019
16,1.0,Love queing its for you,"We spent 50 minutes cramped in a line with coughing wheezing sweaty Koreans waiting for a cable car to the Seoul tower. Believe me it's not worth the hassle or stress.No air conditioning and this is only April. God help people when the Sumner arrives. All because of a technical fault, which sums up Korea. Promises so much delivers little.You are then crammed into a small box for the 2 minute trip and are greeted by a long queue that you will have to join to get back down. All this to go up Seoul Tower where you cannot see out off if the Sun is shining as the windows have not been cleaned for years.Complete waste of time and money, which sums up Seoul.", April 2019
17,3.0,Not that good,The distance of boarding to the nearest metro station is far. You will need to walk up hill.They will squeeze everybody in one car. Literally pack. There wont be enough space to even take pictures., April 2019
18,3.0,"Convenient cable-car, but not worth a visit in itself","The cable-car is convenient, and not particularly expensive, however not worth a visit in itself, and if steps or time are not a problem (of if the line is long), I would recommend just taking the stairs up to the N-Tower at the top of the hill, which makes for a very nice stroll.", December 2018
19,2.0,Too crowded for 1 cable car,This cable car we must stand up with tons of people... not the same with the BBF movies... lil bit disappointed, November 2018
20,5.0,Wheelchair Access,"This visit to Namsan, I noticed that there were lift access for wheelchair visitors which is good knowledge if we were to bring parents next round!Autumn is one of the most beautiful periods to visit.", November 2018
21,4.0,Highly recommended transport to go Namsam,Firstly is to enjoy the city view of Myeongdong city - take a free slanted lift from ground to Cable Car station (foot of Namsan)Slanted lift station is about 8~10 minutes walk from Myeongdong station.Secondly is the mid~high view of colourful forest along the ride in Cable Car.Thirdly is from the highest view on Namsam.It’s also recommended to take stairs from cable car station (foot of Namsam) to ground... Enjoy the last beautiful scene under fresh air in the city ^ ^, November 2018
22,5.0,Exciting Way to Reach The Top,"The queue was long but it was fast-moving. When we were able to finall ride in the Cable Car, it was thrilling to see the view of Seoul from the top. Going down, it wasn't that long for the queue anymore, and the city lights were very cool to stare at while the machine is going down the line.", July 2018
23,2.0,Average ,"The cable is not a must do. I would say to think of it as a way to get to the top but not necessarily a must do activity. There doesn’t seem to have more than two carts running at a time,so I can imagine at peaks times the line will be very long. They pack way too many people onto one cart so the journey is not enjoyable and you might not even get a decent view to look out. I would recommend the cable car if you just want a way to get up to the top but don’t expect anything special. If I was to go again,I would either walk up or take the bus.", November 2018
24,4.0,Easy way to get to the top of Namsan,"We got the cable car to the top of Namsan. We walked from the Myeongdong metro station & there were plenty of street signs that pointed the way to the cable car. We got there at 9:55am, bought our tickets and were on the first cable car at 10:00am. Definitely recommend going at opening time to beat the queue. The cable car has good views, it's a convenient way to get up the mountain and we're glad we did it, but it's not a must-see attraction like the peak tram in Hong Kong.", October 2018
25,3.0,If You Have Time,"Like most large cities, cable car attractions are expensive and if you enjoy taking in the cityscape without wasting time and energy, the Namsan Cable Car is recommended. Otherwise, you may hike or take an alternative but longer route to get to the top.", November 2017
26,4.0,If you're lazy or unfit this is the best way to the N Seoul Tower.,"I was gallivanting about all over Seoul one day recently and decided that as it was so sunny and clear then I should take a look at the city from a high point - the North Seoul Tower, for example. I got close and realised that it could be quite a climb to the top of the Namsan hill on which the Tower is perched. Then I spied the signs to the cable car so decided to take the lazy option and headed over to the entrance. For the princely sum of 9.500 Won an adult can purchase a return ticket on this contraption which can, apparently transport 50 (small) people. Actually the ride is over quite quickly - I guess around 5 minutes and it's not the optimal place to enjoy the views. But I was grateful to avoid an arduous climb. Only later I discovered that you can also take a bus to the Tower which I guess is considerably more economic. Oh, well...", October 2018
27,4.0,Amazing city views,Well worth it! Nice up close view of the tower and amazing view of the city. Come just before sunset for a breath taking view. The city lights at night is also amazing. The cable car ride is usually full pack so do not expect the ride to be a scenic ride. It's just a ride to your final destination., October 2018
28,4.0,One of the ride one must do in Seoul,"We went to this lovely Cable Car ride coming down.It is perfect way to see the beautiful city of Seoul sky line.Only issue is ,it done so quickly and have to be lucky to have clear day.We had some cloudy day.You can do either going up or down.", October 2018
29,4.0,Fastest way to N seoul tower,It’s the fastest way to N seoul tower. located at the bottom of the hill. Cable car can accommodate about 50 pax per trip. Pay round trip ticket if you opt to use it going back down. Nice view to the city while on transit., September 2018
30,3.0,Convenient way to get to N Seoul Tower and Namsan Park,"Namsan Cable Car is the easiest and fastest way for you to visit N Seoul Tower. It is located 10 to 20 minutes walk away from Myeongdong area and the ticket is quite affordable at 8,500 won for adult return trip.The cable car journey however is short, at around 10 minutes journey if I am not mistaken and takes you straight to the foot of N Seoul Tower. Quite a seamless experience but do take note that the cable car is not operational during bad weather. Nothing really special except as a convenient way to visit Seoul Tower and Namsan Park.", July 2018
31,4.0,Romantic night view to and from Namsan Tower,"(I say romantic but I went with my friends so that we could go to Namsan Tower. ) We went around 7:00 PM from Myeongdong Station.  We noticed it was very popular with couples.  Going at night is better than day time to see the city lights I think.  It was worth it for us because we had already been shopping for hours in Myeongdong and walking to the cable car station was a very steep 15 minute walk uphill from Myeongdong Station Exit 2 or 3.  When you buy the ticket for the cable car, there is a short line to get inside the cable cars.  Beware the long line for the ride back at night.", May 2018
32,4.0,Scenic Way to N Seoul Tower,"Roundtrip ticket costs 8500 Won.  I walked from my hotel in Myeongdong to the Namsan Cable Car station.  It was a bit of a walk uphill since the Namsan Outdoor Escalator wasn’t working.  There was no air conditioning in the cable car.  It was crowded going up but it wasn’t crowded going down.  Once the cable car reached the top, you still need to walk up several flights of steps to the N Seoul Tower.  The cable car ride was about 3 minutes long.", May 2018
33,4.0,Great views!,This is definitely not to be missed if you are in Seoul!  The views are spectacular and there are lots of things to see and do - we even tried VR for the first time!, June 2018
34,4.0,Taxi is convenient,We took a taxi from Itaewon straight to the Cable Car station as we heard it's a very long walk uphill. It was a weekday and there was no queue. The waiting area was air-conditioned so that wasnt too bad. Strollers have to be folded while you are in the cable car. Each time a ride can fit about 20 people., June 2018
35,5.0,Cable Cars are the easy way to the top,"I have walked up the hill to the Namsan tower before. In fact, I walked it several times before trying the cable cars.  The cable cars are the way to go!  There are still many steps to go up after getting off the cable car.  If you are not use to walking uphill on a steep incline you will want to wait for the cable car. It also offers very scenic views to the top.", July 2017
36,3.0,Caution when using the shuttle from Myeong-dong,"If exiting at the Myeong-dong metro station, exit via exit 1 (NOT 7/8!!!) and wait on the sidewalk. The shuttle bus stop is NOT signposted.", June 2018
37,5.0,Good view and awesome ride!,"Great view from Namsan cable car, good ride and shortest way up to continue your walk to seoul tower👍🏻", May 2018
38,3.0,Good ride,"Namsan cable car is the best way to get to tje Namsan seoul tower if you do not want to get tired. A round trip fare of 8,500kw for adult and 5,500 for kids and 6,000 for single journey. See picture for reference. If you are going to try this on holidays, you will experience a long time of waiting for the ride. We tried it during childrens day and we waited for about 1 hour. Probably if it is not holiday or weekend, only few people will ride. About 3 or 4 min of ride and you will enjoy the cable car and the beautiful view of seoul.", May 2018
39,5.0,No hiking shoes? Tram it!,"Great price, well maintained, efficient staff. Save your steps for more sight-seeing while in Seoul.", January 2018
40,4.0,No better way to see the mountain in fall or spring colors,"While the line for the cable car can be long & crowded, it is worth the wait for the panoramic views of Namsan. Go during the peak of fall foliage or spring cherry blossoms for the best views! Make sure to check the visibility index before you go.", October 2017
41,4.0,Good to try when Namsan has a great view,"The old cable car which represents Namsan and Seoul.It's nothing special comparing to brand new ones in the country.But, visitors would better try when Namsan is covered with snow, cherry blossoms or fall foliages.Considering the distance, people may complain it's expensive. But, it doesn't require lots of money anyway.Trying during Chuseok or Seolnal isn't recommended because there'll be a crazy number of people.", October 2017
42,3.0,Very crowded,Took the cable car going up to N Seoul Tower. We were greeted with long lines. Rode the bus on our way back to Myeongdong which was easier. Don’t get the round trip tickets and take the bus on your way down., November 2017
43,4.0,Get there early,We arrived soon after they opened and had no wait to get in a cable car.  For 8500 you get a return ride.  Which on a cold spring day seemed more appealing than walking!   Worth it if there is no wait.  However on a warmer day I would walk the gentle slopes., April 2018
44,3.0,You will be faster by foot,When you are healthy and don't have kids or older people with you: Save your time and money and walk up the hill. You will wait at the queue longer than you need to walk up. And you save some money., March 2018
45,3.0,Namsan Cable Car,A short duration ride up to Namsan Park by this cable car is possible. Climbing up by walking is also possible. I guess cable car cost is a bit expensive., April 2018
46,5.0,Great views.,"We went in March so the queues were minimal. The tickets were relatively cheap (return ticket) but do not include entry to the tower (you buy this once you get to the top). The cable car trip lasts for about 2-3 minutes and the views were pretty amazing, you can see for miles! The love locks at the top of the hill by the tower are worth a visit, take your own with you though as they charge a lot if you want to buy one. The tower itself was quite pricey and the view from the LOTTE world tower is much better for a similar price. I can imagine that the walk down from the tower would be great, steep but enjoyable!Worth checking the weather before you head up there as if its windy the cable cars don't operate!", March 2018
47,3.0,Try it for the experience,"Namsan cable car is just a few walks away from Pacific Hotel, the road is quite uphill so I dont really suggest it to older people. We only took the trip going to N Seoul Tower (one way ticket), cause it's just a quick 3-4 min ride up and seeing Seoul's view once is good. BUT, please walk and admire the beautiful scenery once you go down from the Park, you'll see more. there's another photozone that's not crowded and closer to the view :)", March 2018
48,2.0,If you have the time and energy... walk.,"High price, long queue (often in the elements) and then crammed on to the vehicle worrying if the weight limit is exceeded, not my idea of a fun tourist attraction. They even charge a premium for car parking.", February 2018
49,4.0,"Long waits, is it worth it?","Our accommodation was just a short walk from the Cable Car.  We got there and it was  long wait, 40 minutes, slowly progressing in the queue.  There were time estimates provided when you first purchased tickets, so we were happy enough with that, to wait is an informed decision!Good views from the cable car at night.  When you've walked all day, the cable car is the sensible option for getting to the Tower.", November 2017
50,3.0,Citylights,"Hi guys, i just get back from seoul and since its still fresh in my memory, hopefully i can gives you all the detail of the ride. This cable car connect us to Namsan tower  or you might find other name which is N Seoul tower, you need to come to Namsan oreumi elevator to get inline to get to Namsan cable car. May i inform you during winter you need to get your hotpack / coat and also patience ready since there will be long queues from entrance gate to namsan cable car. I go there at sunday night and my waiting time was 45 min for 5 min ride, while on the way back slightly less ( maybe because its already late). So if you have tight schedule pls consider the timing. So many attraction there at Namsan tower. Aside love lock site for your photo portfolio You can get package for your wishes attraction ( you can see in the ticketing). There was hellokitty island, observer deck, hanbok rental, gift shop n many other shop. Mine was hello kitty island and its cuteness overload although its quite expensive for small spaces (cost around usd 8) but fine with me. And the other i can tell you was the city light n the namsan tower itself, must have list on your photo portfolio.", February 2018
51,5.0,The only way to see the heart of Seoul,"It's very connivence to have a better opion rather than walking the whole way beside it's very cheap( 6,700 won) per adult which is about 7 dollars consider the experience. The only thing we disliked is that the ""Cart"" location itself, it's pretty far to walk to there from the subway station but despite that the service is very good.", January 2018
52,5.0,Coolest way to get to the tower!,"My sister and I had a crazy time trying to find this place. It is definitely accessible once you get off Myeongdong exit 4. There is a hotel I think is Pacific Hotel that sits between 2 roads, left and right. We decided to follow the advice of one of the reviews on here and go LEFT at the intersection, HOWEVER we regretted that decision quickly. We went up several steep hills and super steep streets that seemed to go on forever. We had to ask an elderly man for some help and thankfully my sister can speak some hangul so could communicate and he pointed us in the direction. We ended up at the top of the street and because we couldn't see anything that alluded to cable car but could see the tower, we proceeded to walk up 8 sets of stairs. I was frozen and about ready to throw up my dinner. By the time we got up to the stairs we saw the cable car going in the direction we just came from hahaha. We had to walk down and we saw that the cable car was at the top of the street. The ride only lasts a short while like my man, but it was so cool at night! The lights are EPIC. And I got a feel for one of my favourite kdramas Boys over Flowers as this was where Gu Jyn Pyo (LEE MIN HO) shot the scene with Jandi! Yass. Last admission was 10:30pm I think and we made it there around 10:15pm paying around $20AUD for a return trip. DO NOT GO LEFT AT THE INTERSECTION GUYS!!! Unless you want a cardio workout. Go RIGHT! Then go up the set of stairs and you will be right there!", January 2018
53,5.0,"Amazing view, go early to avoid the queue","We used Cable Car when we visited N Seoul Tower. The easiest way is just walk straight from Myeongdong exit 4 and turn to the left at the intersection. Then walk about 300 meters to Namsan Oreumi. Then you can use the elevator to reach Cable Car station. To avoid the long queue on weekend, you can go on Saturday morning. From the Cable Car, you can see the view of the city.", January 2018
54,4.0,"Namsan Cable Car, a scenic route to N Seoul Tower!","We took the Namsan Cable Car to N Seoul Tower.  It was a bit of a walk from Myeongdong Station.  Upon Seeing Price Hotel, we took the most direct route there.", January 2018
55,5.0,Amazing view of the city,"U can walk up to the tower, I saw many people walking down on my way up from the cable car but the weather was so cold at that time. Plus the night view of the city from the cable car was a pretty one.", January 2018
56,3.0,fastest way to reach Namsan tower,i bought the round trip ticket for 2 person. It was a good view when heading to N tower. Good for take it especially when winter time., January 2018
57,4.0,Namsan Tower in Winter,"Two ways to get up there and is good to be there just before the sun set. Winter sunset about 4-5pm. You can take the cable car or taxi or drive if you rent a car. Note that the cable car fee is not the fee to the Namsan tower. Adult return ticket	8,500 won	Adult one-way ticket	6,000 won	Children return ticket	5,500 wonNamsan Tower ticket - 10,000 won for Adult. There is Hello Kitty place which you have to get a ticket too to enter. But its optional.Many eateries available at Namsan Tower. The view is Superp!. Nice place to chill. You don't have to go up the Namsan Tower if you don't want to. At the base of Namsan Tower is good enough to hang out and shoot some photos.", December 2017
58,3.0,Go in the morning,"We visited on a late afternoon in Fall and the queue to purchase tickets was at least 1hr long and then another 30-45min to board the cable car which lasted less than 5min. So we decided to come back in the morning at 11am and lo and behold, there was no queue for boarding the cable car. There were only 2-3 cable cars in operation due to the short distance.Tickets purchase-able for the cable car has several different combinations such as return tickets, or tickets with meals at the italian restaurant etc.Also note that if visiting with the intention of riding the outdoor elevator to the cable car station form street level, the elevator is shut on Mondays and queues can get up to 45min wait. The alternate walk/climb from street level to cable car station is not that exhausting if taken at a relaxed pace. The climb is only 10-15min to get to the cable car station.Alternative method to get up to Namsan is hike or taxi.", October 2017
59,5.0,Cool way to get to N Seoul tower,"Very cool way to go to N Seoul tower. The ride isn’t very long, and it’s also quite cheap. Would recommend to go here when it’s not so many people.", September 2017
60,4.0,Good views of Seoul from the cable car,"The Namsan Cable Car takes you up to the N Seoul Tower Complex. The cable cars give you an all round view of the city as you ascend to the mountain top. To get to the cable cars from street level at Namsan third tunnel, there is a funicular elevator that goes up the short distance to the cable car station – and this takes about two minutes. The funicular is free. The maximum capacity is 20 people and operating hours are 10:00-23:30 to match the operatings of Namsan Cable Car.The ticket price for the Namsan cable car is 8,500 Won return ticket for an adult (equivalent to about GBP 6.00 Aug 2017). The queues build up during the late afternoon/early evening times as a lot of visitors travel during these times to get a daytime and nighttime view of the N Seoul tower. If you wish to avoid the queues, you should go in the mornings. The cable car operates from 10am to 11pm.", August 2017
61,2.0,Don't do it; just walk up to the tower...,"As we wanted to see the sun going down, we went here around 16.00 (on a work day in autumn), to be surprised by a long queue. This turned out to only be the line for the cable cart; a 45 minute wait to get your tickets and another 45 minute wait to get up to the carts themselfs. The cable cart was only a disappointing 3 minutes, so I recommend walking up to the tower. Going back down with the cable cars additionally was an half hour queue.", November 2017
62,4.0,Lazy way to go up,The price for cable car is a little bit expensive but you are served with beautiful trees scenery along the way. Plus you don't have to hike. Shuttle from Seoul Station to the cable car station is available., September 2017
63,4.0,"Nice cool ride, good views........","This cable car ( actually, it is a big single ropeway car like those in Japan) takes you all the way up to the mountain top of Namsan Park. Seems they only have 2 Ropecars- one going up & other on the way  down). Long wait.Surprisingly as the car ascends, you will notice it is quite high up. The views along the ascend & descend were very nice. Especially with the beautiful sun setting in the horizon.This is the best way up to Namsan Park unless you want to hike up on alternative route. ( not sure if there is)Don't come on weekends or holidays. As it is, the queues today ( weekday) for tickets stretches all the way from ground floor to 3/4floors where the boarding area is. There is also an even longer queue on the Ormi Elevator ( see review of Namsan Park).", November 2017
64,4.0,Nice,"Cost 8500 won for a return cable car ride.Takes around 2 mins to go to the top.Luckily the sky was cleared today, you can see miles away.The multi colour of the tree leaves in November was so special.Highly recommended if the weather is nice and sunny.", November 2017
65,4.0,Easy way to get to N tower ,"If you are tired or can’t walk uphill, this a salvation to get to N tower, takes a while to do the line, but sometimes even it is crowded you can get it in matter of minutes", October 2017
66,4.0,Good for one time,Good for one time. I visited with a friend on sunday and it was very crowded so we had to wait for quite a long time. The ride was short but it was fun. You can see some parts of Seoul during the ride. Not breathtaking but a nice experience overall., August 2017
67,5.0,Great views on the way up and crazy arcade at the top,"We queued for about 30 mins and so got up just as the sun was going down. The views of the city from where the cable car drops you are largely obscured by the trees but you could climb the tower to get better ones. However the views on the way up are stunning and at the top are various bars, restaurants and even a games arcade. This felt wonderfully incongruous but we had a lovely time enjoying it. Well worth checking out.", October 2017
68,5.0,Easy way up Namsan with great views,This is a great way to see Seoul from the top. I would suggest taking the cable car up (one-way) and then walking down on the way back. A lot of people were walking up but I personally don't like the steep steps up!Restaurants and shopping at the top if you are into that., October 2017

I would have been furious to wait that long for this banal experience.If I hadn't done the Bukhansan hike the day before, I probably would have just walked up but I was feeling lazy. In future I think I'd either walk up or take a taxi.Not sure why the cable car runs only every ten minutes. Seems like it could go more frequently than that and cut down on waiting times.If you arrive and there's a long queue, I'd highly recommend making other arrangements to get to the top of the hill.", July 2017

There is a limit to people getting in so when its full you wait until the next one.  If you do not want to attempt the Seoul Tower then this is a good ride to take as you will get to the bottom of the tower and there is plenty to do there.

Nice view but its too cold with strong wind from top and im not really enjoy my trip because i had infant with me., February 2017
90,5.0,Very busy on the weekends,The best time to use the cable car is during the week because the line is very winding and even stretches outside for just the ticket booth. Once you get your ticket you have more winding lines to wait for the cable car. Try to get a spot on the windows of the car for great views., July 2016
91,4.0,Easy to find and good for winter :)),"As per the title of the review, it's very near and easy to find from Myeondong stn exit 3. And in the cable car, you can see beautiful view.

They split you off into groups of the maximum number of people and then open the door. If you get a chance get to the back of the cable car on the way up and the front on the way down as that is the best view.

96,3.0,"Fun, useful but crowded",The Namsan hill is very steep so that makes this cable cart very useful. The views are nice but the carts are way too crowded so it will be hard to enjoy the view. Luckily the ride only costa a few Euros and it saves up a lot of time., November 2016
97,3.0,Average experience,"As others have said, this is used to get up the hill without walking, but not much more. It was not as packed when we arrived at around 4:00 pm, but the view from the car is secondary to the view from the top and the top of the tower. Really just saves a walk up hill, which was key with our kids.", December 2016
98,2.0,Take the stairs!,"This is your typical cable car like there are so many, with a nice view along the way that quickly brings you to the N Seoul Tower. However, I was there on a Saturday evening and it was very crowded - had to wait for an hour.

100,1.0,Take the bus to N Seoul Tower,"Don't waste your time or money (8500 won roundtrip!) taking the Namsan cable car up to N Seoul Tower.  Take the bus instead at a much lower cost and it also saves you time!  You will not miss anything by just taking the bus.I was initially tricked into taking the cable car.  I waited for the N Seoul Tower bus in Myeongdong.  A bus came by indicating that it would take me to the N Seoul Tower.  I asked the bus driver and he said it would go to the N Seoul Tower.  I was a bit wary as the side of the bus indicated the Namsan cable car, but the driver insisted that he would go to the N Seoul Tower.  I was a bit angry when it only took me to the Namsan Cable Car station.  This is a pure ripoff as the cable car is much more expensive than the bus up to N Seoul Tower.I made the best of it by then buying the cable car tickets.  Unfortunately, the wait was nearly 30-45 minutes, with the line snaking through the building and at times hidden from view!  It is made like a Disney theme park line so it's hard to tell the wait - and the customer service doesn't tell you the wait time!The cable car itself is quite disappointing.  It is standing room only (suffocating at times).  It was sunset when we took the cable car and unfortunately, the views are also quite disappointing as you don't get a large panoramic view as the view is actually fairly limiting.  The ride is only three minutes in length.Also beware that if you return to the cable car station after 8:30 PM, the complimentary bus stops running after 8:30 PM!  That's what happened to me and I was forced to take a taxi back to Myeongdong.  The taxi driver charged me upfront 20000 won for a short ride back to Myeongdong.  I eventually reported the driver to the Seoul government complaint website and supposedly the driver was disciplined (even though I doubt it and the driver will probably do it again).All in all, don't waste your time in dealing with these deceptive practices being run by the cable car company.", October 2016
101,4.0,"Namsan Cable car in Seoul, South Korea","Our taxi driver dropped us here when we asked about how to get to the Seoul tower and we took the cable car to get to the top.

102,4.0,Come earlier to avoid long Queue,Came here on Sat afternoon. We followed prev reviews to go up the slope near Pacific hotel but missed the part to turn right. We walk up all the way and its a a pretty steep slope. At the end after the stairs we turn right and walked along the path next to the shops area towards namsan cable car. We came around 1-2pm and queue was 40mins long. When we came down around 4-5pm the queue was all the way till outside the building.. super long.And we realise that if u have walked along the roadside from myeondong station there is actually a lift at the bottom that will take you to the cable car station. This easier option is much recommended than the steep climb., November 2016
103,3.0,Used this to get to N Tower.,Nothing spectacular. Consider this as a convenient way and in expensive way to get up to N Tower. WE bought a couple ticket which gave us 2 dinners and round trip tickets for 30000 KRW (round trip ticket itself cost about 8500krw per person).., October 2016

105,3.0,One of kind experience,It was just a ten minute walk from our hotel but as expected when I arrived the line to get a ticket was too long. But the view when your in the cable car was worth the wait.😊, September 2016
106,4.0,Great view of Seoul ,The Namsan cable car is a great way to kill a couple hours while enjoying the great view of Seoul. There are two options to get up to the top. You can pay right $8 one way to ride the sort cable car that takes roughly 5 mins to get to the top. Or you can walk up the stairs for free. The area at the top is huge so there are plenty of places to walk to enjoy a different view of the city., October 2016
107,4.0,very nice view,you can see the whole city is beautiful i did cable car to go up and use starway to go down so i can see both way is its along walking down but if you ask me would i do it again my answer is YES!!!!, September 2016
108,2.0,Squashed in like sardines,"We took the cable car to the Seoul tower. It was a week day night and quite busy. The cable car didn't leave until it was packed full of people. I'm sure the view was great but being short, I couldn't see a thing as I was jammed into the middle. Make sure you push your way to the windows, where you can see the view, and you get some fresh air. There was either no air conditioning or it wasn't working. Made for an uncomfortable journey. Thankfully it's a short one!!", July 2016
109,5.0,Cable Ride,For the lazy ones like us and does not like the hike up and on time constraint--- try the ride. It cost around 8000won return ticket. Its a little difficult to appreciate the view since a lot of people cramp in a little space., September 2016
110,3.0,Sardines in a can,"Uncomfortably crammed into each cable car on the way up and the way down. If you're fortunate enough to have your face pressed against the glass, then you can get a decent view of the city.

111,2.0,There is a big line!,"In the same price I could take a taxi.The ride it self is pretty short, and you really ""pay"" by waiting. It would be nice if they told you there is a big line to get on the cable car(and it is not visible when you are on the other line to get the ticket). It was two floors line, took 20 minutes to get on the cable car. Also be aware that there is a line on the way down too(little bit shorter, but maybe it was because of the hour)", September 2016
112,3.0,Don't use the cable car for anything except getting to the top.,"The cable cars have glass all around htat gives you some decent views, but nothing compared to the views you get at the top of Namsan Tower or at the top of the hill.

121,3.0,Very long waiting time - choose day wisely,"We tried to go to the N Tower twice. We wanted to see Seoul at night so we got to the cable car 9pm on Saturday - BIG MISTAKE. the queue was so long that we would not make it in time to get back (cable car closes 11pm while the N Tower is open till midnight). We returned Sunday at 7:30pm and the waiting time to buy the ticket was 5 mins (plus another 30 mins to actually get into the wagon). You are squeezed like sardines and very few people can see the view (I was lucky to see it). Round ticket for adult is 8,500₩. You can see a lot of the city from the car itself if you are by the window so not sure if really worth paying additional 10,000₩ for the N Tower admission.

The day I went was gloomy and sprinkling but the cable car was still running. While visiting in the afternoon, very busy with tourists so you will be packed like sardines in the cable car.

The views from the top are nice and the city lights are very pretty. The line to come down can get long so be careful you aren't stuck at the top near closing time, as you have to remember you need to take not only the elevator down but the cable car (or a long walk down the stairs).

It was not over priced and the staff were very efficient. The ride up was smooth and fast. We were all very happy.", September 2015
146,5.0,Convenient service,"Definitely a must if you are planning to go Namsan Tower! I went to Seoul during Summer 2014. We took quite some time walking from the Train Station to Namsan Cable Car with such a hot weather. Instead of taking another walk to the tower, we choose to take the cable car with affordable price instead. The journey is less than 10 minutes.", September 2014
147,4.0,Only if you are tired.,"Walk up to N. Seoul Tower if you have the energy.  Or take a bus up.  The line is soooooooo long.  It took me almost 2 hours to walk from myeongdong to the outside elevator that takes you up to here (the elevator also had a line but not as long as the cable car line).  Then another 2 hours to get on the cable car.It was nice though.  But very crowded.  Tip for future visitors.  If you want to use the cable car and see the sunset at N. Seoul Tower, COME HERE AT LEAST 4 HOURS BEFORE SUNSENT.", May 2015
148,4.0,very nice ride,"we enjoyed our ride to the N tower using the cable car. Although it is slow and takes time queuing on the ground but each cable car can accommodate around 20 people, and you will enjoy the scenery view.", June 2015
149,4.0,Useful transport - once you find it!,"Walking from Myeongdong, I found it very hard to find where the cable car station was located even with the official Seoul Visitors Map as my guide. Once I found a very handy lift that takes you from the top of a long staircase up from street-level to the cable car station, I didn't have any more problems. I bought a return ticket and only had short waits each time for the car to come. Both trips were somewhat crowded, so I had limited ability to take in the impressive views of Seoul below.", June 2015
150,2.0,Waited forever,"Decided to go up to see the sunset, so we were there an hour before the sunset- bad idea. The wait took us 3 HOURS!!! The queue was just not moving at all and we didn't realise at that time that apparently theres also a bus going up?! The ride is decent price but not worth the view, the cable cars are packed of people, so you won't see much- and everything you see, you will have a better view up at the hill anyway.. Maybe we just had bad luck, but oh my god how annoying it was to wait in a crowded humid room with no vacant seats..", October 2014
151,3.0,Longest wait of my life,The wait took 30 minutes. So we decide just to take the one way up because the wait was to long. But the prices are great. If you dont like heights+moving cable car  do not try this! The people we rode with were walking and jumping around like crazy!, July 2015
152,4.0,Good service,Very good service. The cars arrives in maximum 10 minutes. The price is not high and you can if want up and down or only one. Have a waiting room and restaurants. Perfect view in the way., June 2015
153,3.0,Expensive and very busy,"The cable car starts from Myeongdong and the ride takes 5 mins max.It is often very busy and thus the queues can be long, very long. One way costs the $6 USD, which is twice of what a taxi will cost. The views on the way are ok, but nicer once on the top.", May 2015
154,5.0,Night at Namsan Tower,"A very good place to see Seoul especially at night. A place to vow your love with your love lock! Bring your own love lock and written message to lock it there! But of course if you have forgotten to bring your padlock, you still can buy the lock there!", June 2015

156,4.0,"Great for Kids, Parents in Their 60s, Couples on Honeymoon, & Those Who Want To See Seoul From Inside A Cable Car :)","I didn't plan on going on the cable car but my knees and feet were still sore after my hike up to Hallasan in Jeju before I went to Seoul. So I skipped walk to the N Seoul Tower and bought myself a return ticket for the cable car ride. As expected, everything was very well organized and maintained. Buying the ticket was super fast. No problem finding the way to the cable car. No problem getting into the cable car although a huge crowd was slowly queueing up - no drama, no unsatisfied customers making a scene because they had to wait too long, nothing. Everything went smoothly.The ride was short but I did get a good view of beautiful Seoul from inside the cable car. The announcements were also made in English. Clean. reliable schedule, professional staffs,the toilets were clean, there's a cafe/mini convenience store  to get a cuppa and what have yous. A good experience all in all.", May 2015
157,4.0,Use this if you have limited time,"It was a bit expensive ($6 for one way, and $8,5 for two ways), but if you are too lazy to climb up the hill, or too afraid of going down, or don't have much time, I recommend you to use since it only took less than 5 minutes to reach the tower. But it based on luck because normally you have to queue.", March 2015
158,5.0,Nice view of Seoul,The cable car ride was a nice view of Seoul.  We went on the weekday morning and didn't have to wait too long to get on a cable car.Glad that we took the car ride up. We still had a nice walk up to get to the Namsan tower platform area., April 2015

160,2.0,skip it,"The ride is so short and unless you get a standing window view, it's very unmemorable.  Overpriced for the short ride, too.  My second time up.  First time was 20 years ago.  This experience was a bit worse because the lines are longer now.  Take the scenic hike up or down if you can.", April 2015
161,3.0,Long queue,"Had read about long queue's on the weekend.  It's true!  After eventually finding the escalator and queing for that, we got to the ticket counter where the sign said 60 minute wait...ended up being just under 2hrs.  Sardine style 3 min ride", April 2015
162,5.0,Clean and Helpful,"Fastest way to reach Namsan Seoul Tower.  The Cable Car Station is easy to reach from Myeongdong but the road is quite an uphill, so you better use Namsan Orumi if you think it will be hard for you to walk on an uphill road.", April 2015

164,5.0,Fun way to get up to Seoul Tower,Did a round trip fare on the Cable Car and it's a more relaxing/fun way to ride to the top as opposed to walking or bus. Nice if you've never done it before., March 2015
165,4.0,Hi View,"If you want to see Seoul 360'..You Should goThe Namsan Cable Car is one of the many ways to get up to the Namsan Park. First, you'll have to take a small tram leading to the cable car station and buy your tickets", November 2014
166,4.0,Exciting with Good View,"If you want to go to the N Seoul Tower, try taking the Namsan Cable Car which will take you at he base of the tower. You can opt not to go up the tower. The view of Seoul at the base is already fantastic. Although from the nearest station, you have to walk a bit uphill to get to the 'terminal'. We went there on a weekday night so there are less crowd and no long queues.", January 2015
167,3.0,One way to get to N Seoul Tower,A convenient way to get to the N Seoul Tower. You can access to the cable car station via the Namsan Oreumi (sidewalk elevator). Beware that the staff will try to squeeze as many passengers as possible into the car!, January 2015
168,5.0,Exciting ride!,"The Namsan Cable Car is one of the many ways to get up to the Namsan Park. First, you'll have to take a small tram leading to the cable car station and buy your tickets. The round trip ticket is much more worth than the single journey ones. The cable car fits more than 30 people at a time and it will only depart when the number of people is enough so you might have to wait a while if there are not enough people. The 3-minute ride itself enables you to have a fantastic view of the city so make sure to get your camera ready. As for the safety aspect, I have no complains as there is a staff in the cable car who controls the journey and ensures a smooth ride. The next time you are going up to Namsan Park, make sure you take the cable car ride up.", December 2014

170,3.0,An OK cable car.,"The nearest Metro station to the cable car is Myeongdong.It's a good 700 meters walk (partially up hill).Upon arrival, you take an inclined elevator to the entrance and from there the fun begin.""Fun"" is a relative thing, that it.While there was no queue while we visited, the ride itself (9 US$ return ticket) was not very eventful nor long.The view is a big meh, and is mostly made up of residential and office buildings.The hill itself is beautiful and looks just great while passing above it.Is it worth the time and effort? Well, the climb is rather steep and is almost impossible while the stairs are slippery, so yes, while not a ""must"", it's an ok experience.", July 2014
171,1.0,"Waste of time, money, and inconvenient","I've visited Namsan Tower four or five times in my nearly two years in Seoul.  Today, for the first time, I took the cable car.  Normally, I walk up the trails to the top, but this time I was with my 77 year old mother. For her sake I figured taking the cable car would be easier since it drops you off right at the base of the tower.  Bad call.I didn't realize that the walk to the cable car building was going to be long and up a steep incline from the Myeongdong subway station.   Normally I wouldn't care, but since I thought it would ease my mother's burden, I figured this was the best option for getting to the top.  Isn't the point of a cable car to save you the energy of walking up a hill/mountain? Why not start it lower down the hill and give the riders a longer ride.  Speaking of longer ride, the whole trip up is about three minutes!  6,000 won one way for only that?  Not worth it at all.  This is even coming from someone who had a good view on the cable car and only had to wait about 20 minutes in line.  I know most people have to wait an hour or more and often times have a bad view in the car.  If that was our case, I'd feel very angry and cheated.  I still feel that way, just to a lesser degree.  Overall, hike up the mountain and don't take the cable car.  With someone who isn't capable of that?  It still may be easier to get the bus to the Seoul Tower stop and walk the final half kilometer or so up the hill.", October 2014
172,4.0,Good quick way up to Namsam Tower,Easy to get tickets took four kids (between 3to 8) & two adults was fab way to get to the top of Namsam loads walks down to whichever area. Went on a bank hols and was not busy if you get there before 10am., October 2014
173,4.0,Beautiful,"Although you have to wait in line for a couple of hours ( we wanted to take it at night ) it's worth every penny. If you are a Kdrama lover, you will be reviving Boys Over Flower's JanDi and Joon Pyo sleepover in the car. Just breathtaking views.", April 2014
174,5.0,Nice ride,"A return trip on this cable car cost 8,500 won. It's a fast and fun way to arrive at N Seoul Tower. To arrive at this cable car, you need to alight at Myeongdong subway then hike up the road to this place. It's quite taxing due to the elevated road but worth it.At peak hours, the cable car can be too crammed but still okay.", April 2014
175,3.0,A good way to get to N Seoul Tower quickly,"If you want to visit the Seoul Tower and must do it in a rush, then take a taxi. But if you have some time and do not mind standing in a potential long queue, then this can be a good choice. The ride cost 8500 won return ticket and takes just a couple of minutes, which is good since it will most likely be very crowded. If you are in good shape and can spare a day or so, try hiking up instead through Namsan park and use the money for lunch or an extra beer.", July 2014
176,5.0,A must do while in Seoul,"Wonderful city views provided from the Car and once atop Namsan (Mount Mongmyeok) where, if you are with your lover, you can purchase a lock and throw away the key, symbolically locking your hearts to each other there on a fence/lock wall.  Its a lovely idea.  You can also get dressed in traditional Korean clothing and have your photo taken.  If you want to save some money, bring your own lock.  :)", January 2014

Besides exhausted a little bit :D Next time when I go, I will leave enough time to play with children who are having fun in the water spraying fountains! It was a really amazing refresher after a long climbing!!!", June 2014
179,3.0,Very quick ride. Nice views but quite cramped during busy periods,We climbed up the hill and took the cable car down. The ride was much quicker than expected. They try to squeeze as many people into each car so it can get quite cramped. The views are nice if you are lucky enough to stand by the sides in the cable car., June 2014
180,5.0,Good way to get to the top,"Very crowded, as the sign said they won't send the car up or down with less than 30 passengers. Nicer than walking when it's cold and raining though!", April 2014
181,3.0,"Quick trip, don't expect much","Although convenient, the cable car costs 8500 KRW for a return trip and can be quite crowded. You are not guaranteed to see anything, it just makes the trip up the mountain quickly. While I did not have to wait too long, others in the queue said that they had been waiting for some time - the operators do not appear to have a time schedule and only send cable cars up and down when the numbers are close to maximum.", April 2014
182,3.0,good but not so great.,"I took the cable car up to where the tower was. It was at night and packed. Not worthy. I'd rather take the bus or walk up. If there were lesser people, i guess it its fine.", December 2013
183,2.0,Long wait for not much,"We waited more than an hour to ride the cable car.  We took the cable car for convenience rather than as an attraction; however, between the wait time and the necessity of taking a taxi to the base of the cable car in the first place, I am not sure it was any more convenient.  As many people have mentioned, you get packed in with heaps of other people and if you are lucky you might get a view.", February 2014
184,2.0,Pricey and short,A very short trip in a packed capsule. The staff were rude. People were racing to get good spot. Its quite expensive but still better than climbing the whole way up on a cold winter night., January 2014
185,3.0,Expensive but a nice experience,"We took the round trip ride. It was cheaper that way. It is a bit pricey but it was a nice experience. Although, we had to climb up from the train station to the establishment. There might be a better way since we were the only one who walked uphill.The view was breathtaking.", October 2013
186,3.0,Good view of the city at night,"My friends and I went up to N Tower at night. So it was not too crowded and we didn't need to wait too long to board the cable car. Once arrive at the top station, you will need to climb a few more flight of stairs to reach the tower. At the tower, there are options to see the Teddy Bear Museum and go up the tower, but would need to pay extra fees. This location is where young people go for dates. Its also good for kids as they have the Teddy Bear museum.", September 2013
187,3.0,Below average,"Went to the cable car with friends, and it was not at all as expected. The cable car gets so crowded that it almost impossible to take snaps from the car when it is in motion. What is the point in getting into a cable car if you can't look around and take snaps, and enjoy the scenery?Hope the management does something proactive and solve this problem. Also the steps were very slippery in winter.", August 2012
188,4.0,Easier than Walking and Quicker Than the Bus,"For the cable car going up, there was pushing and shoving to get a spot close to the windows and we were packed in like sardines.  Coming down there was plenty of room since most people seem to buy a one-way ticket up and then walk down.  8,000 Won for round trip ticket, which was slightly less than ticket to the Observation Deck at the N Seoul Tower, but worth it.  They operate on a ten minute schedule going up and going down.", June 2013
189,4.0,Nice view of city from cable car,"If you're looking for the fastest way to get up to N Seoul Tower and want to get a great view of the city, I'd suggest you take the cable car up!:) The journey up is rather short, but suits people who find walking a hassle.", June 2013
190,4.0,The easy way up,"This is an easy way to get up to the Tower. I'm of retirement years and currently have a slightly sore stubbed toe, but only bought the upward trip. No regrets. Walking down was not too strenuous. It's worth finding the free lift between the same level as the subway exit. I climbed up to lower station by aiming for the PRC Embassy, not knowing there is a free lift if you follow the more major road. I only found that by walking down. Between the upper cable car and the Seoul Tower, I bought some delicious fried spiral potato. Spring seems to be late this year so the trees were a bit bereft of bud.", April 2013

192,4.0,Best way to reach N Seoul Tower,"Usually you can say riding a cable car is fun and exciting and offers a great scenic view of the area, and that is the case here, but more importantly the Namsan Cable Car is the way to reach the N Seoul Tower.   To get to the Cable car, take the subway line 4 (light blue) to the Myeongdong station, take exit 7 or 8 and you will be in front of an office building/bank.  Wait here for the free shuttle that will take you to the cable car station.  See my review of N Seoul Tower for complete directions and information.  Ticket prices are 8,000 KRW round trip.  The cable cars hold lots of people.  If you are lucky to get on first stand near the front window.  I used my Ipad to video some of the ride up and the surrounding city views.  Good pics.", September 2012
193,5.0,Great way to go to N Seoul Tower,"Perfect shortcut to N Seoul Tower if you don't want to walk though the park (or if its too cold or dark). 8,000 for a return ticket, or 6,000 for one way.", December 2012
194,3.0,A functional ride to N Seoul Tower,"This is an efficient and convenient way to get to N Seoul Tower, barring queues. Took this ride on a Wednesday early evening and didn't wait long on both directions. The cable cars run every 10 minutes. They get as much people inside as the cable car permits and some will inevitably be in the middle portion with an obscured view. Luckily was last to get in. It's KRW 6000 (~USD5.50) one way, KRW8000 (~USD7.30) return. The ride was short, maybe around 3-4 minutes and there's not much to say really. It was not memorable or exciting, and this could also be because of better cable car rides taken in other cities. This felt more like a functional ride rather than a scenic ride and would've been allright to skip this for those with the extra 30 minutes and the energy to climb to the tower instead. Not sure if the trail is straightforward or easy to follow.  Note that the cable car ride does not exclude one from having to climb to the tower entirely, as there are still a number of steps going up before reaching the base of N Seoul Tower.  Walked to the cable car platform from the Myeong Dong shopping district; if coming by metro just get off Myeong Dong station exit 3 or 4. Take the slanted elevator on Sogong-Ro which is marked by a monument that looks like a tall pillar with an eagle on top (called the Namsan 3rd Tunnel Completed Monument). More detailed directions are available in the official Korea Tourism website.", October 2012
