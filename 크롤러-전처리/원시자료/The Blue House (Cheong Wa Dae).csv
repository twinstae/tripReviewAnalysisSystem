0,5.0,Beautiful South Korean Head Of State ☺️,"Visited The Blue House (Korean: 청와대; Hanja: 靑瓦臺; Cheong Wa Dae; literally ""pavilion of blue tiles"") is the executive office and official residence of the South Korean head of state, the President of South Korea, located in the Jongno district of the capital Seoul.  It is painted", December 2019
1,4.0,Presidential house ,"The blue house is the official residence of the President of South Korea and is a short walk from the Gyeongbokgung Palace. The place is tightly guarded and you can view the Blue house from across the road. The building offers a nice photo opportunity with the mountain at the background. During some days, a tour of the gardens of the house is available (no entry into the building).", November 2019
2,3.0,Birthday trip,"I was really hoping to get a closer look at the famous ( Blue House), but it was only a glimpse through the vehicle window. We were not even allowed to slow down, but had to drive by at regular speed. The pics were got were not worth posting. Guards everywhere.  A bit disappointed, but understand that all cultures have rules. So I will just continue to look at it in the dramas. It was still good get a glimpse of other countries operate.", September 2019
3,5.0,The Guards in Blue House are all so Handsome!,"We joined the blue house tour, it was an hour tour which bring you around the blue house for a visit. The guards are all very good looking!", May 2019
4,5.0,The Blue Power House in Seoul,"You would need to book at least one month ahead to let them check your particulars for free access. All my Korean friends did not know about this free visit of their president residence.Lots of school kids accompanied by their oma (Mother) and a few tourists were in our group. The tour was conducted in Korean. We were offered an audio guide in English. I count ourselves lucky to be in such near proximity to Cheong Wa Dae. They lined us up in groups. We walked from one lane after another in the huge garden. I felt so at peace looking at the 300 hundred year-old tree and the impeccably designed landscape with many fountains. The highly alert male and female guards were all martial arts trained. I saw this big guy lifted up a seven or eight year-old boy with just one arm easily.We were given a souvenir pouch to take away which was such a nice touch.After the tour which lasted for an hour, the kids went home. We were offered the chance to tour the Chilgung Shrine (The Seven Palaces) next to the Blue House. I had planned to visit it and stayed on. Two other ladies who did not expect a further tour followed us.The shrine was dedicated to the seven concubines from the Joseon dynasty who bore sons (世子) who became the future kings. Their spirit tablets were placed in each of the seven shrine/ palace with its own name. Once escorted there, a friendly lady came out to show us around. She spoke very good English with the tour lasted a mere 15 minutes. While walking the ground of the shrine, I said to her “ah-reum-dap-da” which was to compliment it to be such a pretty and serene place. I dared not request her to open up one shrine for us to take a look inside. It would be rude to disturb the royal ladies in there.A very well spent morning in Seoul.", September 2018
5,3.0,Nothing special,"Remember to book the visit in advance (at least 2 months in my case). On the day of the visit you have to go to the 경복궁 area to take a bus that will take you to the Blue House. You get a mug as a gift.I’d advise to go there in spring/summer. I went there in February and there really wasn’t anything interesting to see. The tour is watching some short video, then walking around the park and buildings. Wouldn’t go there again.", February 2019
6,2.0,Nothing much,"booking in advance is required (foc). seriously nothing much at all. u get a mug as door gift. you will just be briefed that this and that buildings are for what purpose, holding what events. nothing else.", April 2019
7,4.0,Must book in advance ,Please book in advance and I suggest weekdays visits (tuesday-Friday) as Saturday visits (2nd and 4th) are full of families. Please follow the instructions ie don’t take photos in places that you are not supposed to. Given a nice mug as souvenir. Remember to bring your passport., October 2018
8,5.0,Book at least 3 month in advance,"If you want to pay a visit here, please book an appointment online at least 3 month in advance. It is free. On the day itself, do not directly go to entrance, find the designated gathering area.", November 2017
9,3.0,Catch a view from Gyeongbokgung Palace,"You can catch a glimpse and take a photo of The Blue House coming from within Gyeongbokgung Palace. Keeping the Hyangwonjeong Pavilion walls (the two-story hexagonal pavilion that's currently walled up) on your right, and the Jibok-jae building in front of you, keep walking until you see a gate with guards on your left. (The gate is closest to the Jibok-jae building within the Palace, and is on the north area of the palace complex.) Go out through the gate, and you'll see a larger gate with guards on your right. You can go out to take a photo of The Blue House across the road, but be sure to keep your Gyeongbokgung entrance ticket with you as you re-enter Gyeongbokgung!", July 2018
10,3.0,If you have no place to go,"Needs to book in advance, and always fully booked from the website. It might be fun for the local, but not so interesting to the foreigners. Overall, it's a walking tour, not much to see. The souvenir is a good surprise.", August 2018
11,3.0,Outside,Just a walk around the area as I believe it’s not meant to be a tourist spot where one can freely enter the compound. Anyway we were here as one of the itinerary for our tour. Took some pictures outside it and that’s about all., June 2018
12,5.0,A Tight Guarded Palace,"This palace is very strictly guarded by presidential security staff. So you can going inside the palace by registering at their website. Not every time you can joins this tour. You must choose the date & time you wants to join, at least 1 month before the date & time you choose, because visitor from another country are being minimalized. Don't forget to came early (at least 1 hour before your tour) because you must re-registered yourself with your email confirmation & passport at bus parking area at Gyeongbokgung Palace. Please wait on the line, because visitors with their guided tour (from China & Korea) are extremely huge. The staff will be calling your name & you must going inside the bus which will brought you inside the palace. After get off from the bus, you will through security check, gets ID card & translator machine (if you're from outside Korea) & going inside the auditorium to listens some opening speech from the staff. After that, you will going outside the auditorium & the staff will be brought you around the palace & you'll get mineral water & free souvenir too (pouch for adults & mini globe for childrens). Yeayy!! After the tour ends, they will brought you back to the bus parking area at Gyengbokgung.", May 2017
13,3.0,Tour of the Cheong Wa Dae grounds,"This was an outside tour of the grounds only - we could not go inside any of the buildings.  I had to register online in advance of my visit and supply my passport number.  On the day of the tour, I went to the meeting spot at Gyeongbokgung Palace, where the tour buses were.  My passport was checked there and then we took the bus to Cheong Wa Dae.  There, we went through security and our passports were checked again.  This is also when you can pick up a headset to listen to the tour in  English.  We walked around the grounds and were able to take photos in designated spots only.  We were not allowed in any of the buildings.  There were some school kids on a field trip in our group, so it was a pretty noisy group to be with.I enjoyed the tour, but truthfully was a bit disappointed in what the tour actually consisted of.  I didn’t feel like it was anything soecial, considering we had to book well in advance to attend.  Each visitor did receive a free Cheong Wa Dae coffee mug as a gift, which I thought was nice.  All-in-all, if you are on a tight time schedule, this is probably something you can take off your list of must-see places.", March 2018
14,3.0,Closer than the White House,"We walked along the palace to see this place.  There was a lot of security along the street.  We can see the Presidential palace from a distance; but at lease, 10 times closer than the same view for the White House.  Surprisingly, the security guard helped us take our pictures.", December 2017
15,4.0,READ THIS ONE - DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE,"This is a working Korean presidential residence. Located North from the Gyeongbokgung Palace. We were not aware that one can make a special inside tour reservations online. So, do it. I am sure it is worth it. Otherwise, you will just take pictures from the outside.", November 2017
16,3.0,Can be omitted if time is lacking,"This is the Presidential palace where the first family lives and goes to office, receives important guests, etc. Security is very tight as you have to schedule way before the actual day of tour and everything you bring inside is inspected carefully. Pictures can be taken only on designated spots and you are accompanied by guards at all times. We were unlucky that a group of tweeners were in our batch and they were a rowdy bunch. The whole tour was made in Korean too so we didn't understand anything that the guide was saying. Maybe they thought that since we had a Korean friend accompanying us, he would do all the talking/ translating! I thought it was unfair to him since they should've considered the other foreigners in the group. Anyway, there is not much to see inside and no special souvenirs were given to us so we sort of just had a long walk inside the palace complex without even seeing anything inside the palace itself.", October 2017
17,3.0,Don't waste your time,"If you want to take pictures and proof that you have been to Seoul and visited the Presidential Blue House, just do so. But a tour to this area ,not really worth it. Just go elsewhere.", March 2017
18,3.0,Can be skipped if time-poor~,"I booked the tour to Cheong Wa Dae out of curiousity especially since the Blue House is located right next to the east gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace. Both places are located right at the foot of Mount Bugaksan. I had a lot of expectation for this tour especially since it's the presidential house. I thought they'd cancel the tour especially with the impeachment of the former President Park Geun-hye.We went to the tour information booth outside of the Gyeongbokgung Palace. We had our passports and reservation checked by the Chong Wa Dae staff. Once they gave an all-clear, we boarded the shuttle bus that would take us to the Blue House. Somehow the shuttle bus reminded me of the karaoke bus filled with ahjumma in some Korean TV dramas, especially with the colourful lights inside. You may also recognise this in Psy's ""Gangnam Style"" music video.When we arrived, we had to undergo a security check. Hubby's backpack was an abyss so it was really messy and he had to take out everything one by one. Our passports were swapped with an audio guide and lanyard. We were also given a souvenir from Cheong Wa Dae and a laminated brochure with a brief explanationof the areas. We were briefed about the presidential house at the Public Information Hall and were re-informed that we could only take photos at 3 out of 6 main places that we visited.At Nok Ji Won, the successor of the previous president would usually plant a tree to commemorate their era of reign. The oldest tree there was about 310 years old. I almost took a photo right away but was told by one of the guards to wait until the guide told us so *phew*. Every tourist will have photos of this since we could only take photos with the large tree as the background.This was the highlight of the tour itself especially to be able to see the Blue House. We couldn't get closer to it though. I assumed the former President Park Geun-hye was under house arrest there... hahaha :-). The Blue House has 150,000 handmade ceramic blue coloured roof tiles and behind it is the Bugaksan Mountain.The building to the right of the Blue House was dedicated to Admiral Yi Sun-sin while the one on the left was dedicated to King Sejong the Great. Both buildings are usually used for meetings.The last building that we were shown was the State Reception House. All of the white pillars at the bottow floor were created from one single stone. This is the place where the president holds the reception to welcome international guests. Only the guests are allowed to walk in from the front door.There was an additional tour to see Chil Gung that we joined in. Chil Gung complex consists of five shrines where each shrine was dedicated to a concubine who gave birth to a future king in the Joseon era.I felt the Blue House tour was quite short and it was unfortunate that we could only take photos at some areas. If you have extra time in Seoul and would like to see the inside of the Presidential Complex, then I'd advise you to book the tour in advance. If you're short of time, this is one of the tours that you can remove from your itinerary.", January 2017
19,2.0,Tour has the wrong title,"This tour was a bit of a disappointment to our group. The group was full of small children who were on field trips, and though somewhat well-behaved - they were still annoying. Especially since the reservation system makes it seem like it's a much smaller group that will be going. This tour is also not a tour of the Blue House, but is only a walking tour of the grounds. For all of the security checks and reservations that you have to go through - might as well just go to a park if you want to see green spaces as there isn't much else on offer for this tour than just that. The foreign language tours are offered only through headsets with recordings. One member our group had the battery die on his while we were on the tour and the staff just kind of shrugged and said they couldn't do anything to help with the problem. Overall, I would advise people to not waste their time with this tour.", June 2016
20,2.0,Not bad but there is better.,"I attended this tour in DEC 2007 and JAN 2017... it has gotten worse. During the 2007 tour we were able to go very close to the Blue House and inside of the Reception building. Neither of these happened in 2017. In short it should not be called a ""Blue House Tour"" as you cannot actually tour the Blue House.I toured the White House in Washington twice (FEB 2000 & FEB 2001). It is AWESOME and 90% of the tours were inside and you could take photos more than at the Blue House (and you are outside the whole time).  In 2009 my wife and I went to the Governor Generals Estate in Canada, without schedule, and was allowed on the grounds and to walk up to the door; another AWESOME experience. It was closed that day but the guards still made it an experience better than that of the Blue House.", January 2017
21,4.0,The Blue House Tour 2016 (OCT),"The experience overall is good, but be prepared to have over run, especially they will ask you if you are available for an extra tour at the back of the blue house.Yea the best thing is to receive the pouch or a mug as a gift. Something that i do not like is that the ushers do not know basic english. They simply give all instructions in Korean and if you ask anything in english, they will never know what you are asking.", October 2016
22,4.0,Free Tour- See Only Outside of Buildings,"There were many things I wish I had known going into this tour, so I hope to give future travelers some insight.You must book this tour in advance, which requires providing your passport information. I believe I booked a month or two in advance. You sign up for your desired date and time, and receive a confirmation E-mail. Security here is very tight, so I carried around a printed copy of my confirmation E-mail. The tour itself is (at the time of me writing this) completely free.You must bring your passport with you, and it will be checked many times. Arrive 30 minutes prior to your start time. I had an issue finding the designated meeting area, so let me shed some light. Upon reaching the Gyeongbok Palace, (we took Gyeongbokgung Subway Exit 5) ensure you are within the walls of the palace. Walk all the way to the East side of the compound (there are many walls and gates. I had to ask for help from two charming workers to find it.) Keep walking until you reach a parking lot. You will see a little building (I remember it being white) filled with chairs and TV screens. Go in there and wait. Closer to your departure time, your group lines up at a ticket counter, where your passport (and perhaps confirmation E-mail) are verified. Make your way to the bus (employees tell you where to go, and in my situation, all spoke English well.)The bus drives you up to a theater/guest house of sorts. You go through a metal detector, I was asked to snap a photo of the ground with my camera to prove it was a camera. What I was not anticipating was for the guides to take my passport in exchange for an English speaking audio-guide (They had other languages available, but, we were given English based on our passports.) Everybody who ""rented"" an audio-guide had their passports held for them. We were also all given badges to wear around our necks.This process takes some time. Just a warning. After all that, we are entered into a room to watch a short movie (enter audio-guide.) Then we were ushered out, told to make 2 single file lines, and begin walking along the tour. We were given a sweet gift (super thoughtful, thanks, South Korea!) and a photograph that showed where we could and where we absolutely could not take photos. This was very helpful. The sheet gave a brief description (yes, mine was in English) of what we were going to see, and also the corresponding numbers for the audio-guide. As the tour leader spoke Korean, we could listen along in our desired languages.There are about 5-6 stops on the tour, and the tour itself took about 60 minutes once we left the theater. The second to last stop is the blue house, which is truly beautiful. When the tour ended, we were given the option to see one more place, or to return our audio-guides and retrieve our passports. It had started to rain, so we opted for our passports.I have read that there is no transportation back to the Gyeongbok Palace. I followed people from my tour (who did not speak English) to a bus that brought me back to the Palace. I am not sure if I hopped on a private bus, or if due to the rain, but they did shuttle people back.Note that you are not allowed to enter any of the buildings after the guest house. You only gaze and photograph from afar.I definitely enjoyed this tour. I thought it was cool to learn about Korea's history and also their politics. There is a lot of walking required. The tour provided rain slickers as it started to rain, which was thoughtful. All in all, I am very thankful that I attended the tour, but I would not necessarily do it twice.", September 2016
23,4.0,informative free tour,they check your passport a lot to enter the tour and to continue.  tour moves a bit slow as you are waiting to proceed many times.  at the end of the tour you walk out the gate and there is no one to help get to the tour bus. that was uncomfortable.  however I enjoyed the tour and it as very imformative, September 2016
24,4.0,The Presidential Palace!,"After our walk about tour in Bucheon and having our lunch as part of our full day city tour, our guide drove us here for a short ""photo stop"".The Blue House is the official residence of the President of Korea, akin the White House of the US and Downing Street of the UK. It has a large compound with nice architectural designs that depicted its long history, politics and culture.The entire surrounding is heavily guarded with many policemen standing guard on the entire stretch of road and nearby small roads and lanes. Well, vehicles are not allowed to stop outside but walking visitors can enter it to visit the place at designated areas (but must make prior appointment and booking) and photography though allow but at some locations/public areas only.As we were rushing to our next destination, we just dropped by outside the entrance for a quick photoshop of the palace building and ground though we would have hoped to book the appointment to enter and visit it.Interesting to visit and who knows you might be lucky to see the President!", September 2016
25,4.0,Beautiful architecture and interesting history,"We stopped at the Blue House for a photo opportunity on a guided tour with Koridoor Tours. It is a beautiful place with a very interesting history. We did not get to go on the grounds of the Blue House, but we admired it from several angles and learned a bit about it. This is a great place to see if you are interested in politics, history, architecture, or Korean culture.", September 2016
26,3.0,It's an ok visit,We were stumbled at this place during our journey looking for Bukchon village. We did not even realize it until we saw tons of polices. There is nothing to see in this place as it's crowded and heavily guarded. We took a couple pictures of the blue house from a far at designated place., July 2016
27,5.0,A Trip to the President's Palace,You cannot enter the premises without securing an appointment at least three weeks before your preferred schedule. Visit their website (https://english1.president.go.kr/tours) to schedule an appointment. The place is high security and there are certain restrictions i.e there are areas not allowed for picture taking. Big bags are not allowed but there are lockers in the receiving area where you can place your bags. Non-Korean speaking guests will be given a gadget which has a recording of an area's description. You will not be able to enter The Blue House. Photo opts are outside the building only., September 2015
28,4.0,Presidential Visit,There was not much to see since the tour was only restricted to some places inside the compound. Non-korean speaking guests were given a gadget which would help you throughout the tour and the significance of the stops. Photos were also restricted to certain parts. Please remember if you want to join the tour you have to register online before your visit., December 2015
29,3.0,Underwhelming but nice,"Since you only walk around the grounds and learn about the history of the place and see the exterior of the building, this tour in no way compares to a visit of someplace like the White House. However their pride in the property and their government is evident and everything is super well maintained and well protected. For me the fun part was watching the huge tours of middle aged Koreans,similarly dress dressed women, treat the young security guards like sons, and ignore them! It also is the only time in Korea where the crowd has not been constantly on the their cell phones or taking selfies, certainly only because it was forbidden .", June 2016
30,4.0,Korean President's Palace,Naturally security is high around the palace.  It was good to get a photo however I preferred to go and spend more time in the neighbouring Museum of Folk History rather than do the short tour., March 2016
31,2.0,A very fast tour...,"In order to get a guided tour of the Blue House, you need to register on their website. Foreigners are welcome and they give you an audio guide for the tour. The tour itself is very fast and you don't see much, just a brief introduction and then a quick walking around of the gardens. Unlike the tour of the White House in the United States, you don't actually get to walk inside of the Blue House here... all you do is take photos from the perimeter. The tour itself took about 40 minutes maximum and they don't have public restrooms so if you need to go, use it beforehand. It does come with a nice gift, but the tour itself is not so great.", April 2016
32,5.0,It's a Drive-By,We weren't actually able to stop and take pictures. We drove though on a tour bus. It's amazing how close we got to the presidential home. Hopefully I got some good pictures., April 2016
33,4.0,A must see,There are numerous sights to see in Seoul.  Don't miss the Blue House.  A little out of the way but worth the trip., May 2015
34,4.0,Great Place but restricted area to visit,"This is the official residence of the President of Korea, you are permitted to go everywhere comparatively you are allowed to small area, but very well maintained,there is no entry fee we were escorted by our Korean  friends, you can take photos with the president of course Photoshop, and her official office table replica, great  place to visit and we enjoyed a lot.", March 2016
35,4.0,Wonderful Experience,"What a wonderful experience we had at the Cheongwadae(Blue House) which is like the official residence for the Korean President. Beautiful landscape, amazing buildings and macho and good-looking bodyguards that took care of us. What an eye feasting day for me! We also received a good quality souvenir from Blue House. A place worth to visit.", March 2016
36,4.0,Beautiful!,"So glad we got to see this! It is visible from the main palace in Seoul, and it's got the most amazing backdrop of the mountain behind it. Worth seeing for sure.", February 2016
37,5.0,The president's house,Not really a must see but it was part of the tour we had. It would also be good to know the Malacanang/White huse counterpart of Korea. We were not allowed to go near and there were many guards around the area.Visited on Nov 2014, February 2015
38,3.0,The Tour was Sadly Underwhelming,"The official tour of Cheong Wa Dae ""The Blue House"" (ROK's version of the US White House) was in fact only a very limited and quick tour of some of the grounds, with limited opportunity for photographs, with a large school group, and a guide who spoke only Korean and whose narrative did not remotely match that of the free headset given for translation. In fact, sometimes the tour guide would speak for 2 minutes and start moving the group, while the information in my headset would take several minutes and would be continuing while the herd was moved along. Sadly, I feel like I really didn't learn much about the Blue House, Korean politics or government. These kinds of locations fascinate me, and could have been really interesting.The police officers were more friendly and interactive (though entirely professional and vigilant) than our tour guide.This tour could be so much more with some easy fixes.1. Ensure that those using a headset for another language are told when to start playing a particular number so they know what is going on.2. Include group directions in the audio program, along with the description of the area. (e.g., It is now ok to take photos, or You can only shoot photos in this direction.)3. Greater match between the tour guide narrative and the headset narrative. My native Korean companion said the match was limited at best.4. If it is an ""English tour"" it would be nice to have someone there who speaks English to answer questions. Fortunately, my companion could ask and translate for me.5. Be clear up front that the tour will go nowhere near entering the Blue House.The best part of the tour was when a special guide was assigned to take the 4 English speakers in the group to the shrine next door. She was friendly, knowledgeable and very informative. This part of the tour was everything the earlier portion had not been.I truly hope the organizers of the Blue House tour will work to improve what could be a terrific tour of one of the major sites of Korean politics.If you plan to go, plan in advance. You will need reservations and must carry your passport (or Korean ID) with you.", December 2015
39,5.0,Beautiful place to arrange beautiful country ,This is the presidential palace of South Korea. It is really nice place. Located after the gyeongbokgung palace.. The blue rooftop can be seen from very far distance.. Lee Min Ho drama City Hunter has been film here..😂😂😂, May 2015
40,3.0,"Beautiful grounds, short tour","The well-manicured grounds of Cheong Wa Dae was beautiful, especially in autumn. It took us around two months to get a tour spot (free tour). Security was rather tight, and photography was quite restricted (only a few positions, zoom lenses not allowed). Headphones with alternate languages such as English were available free of charge with passport. The tour felt very abbreviated - about 20 minutes.", November 2015
41,4.0,South Korea has The Blue House and USA has the White House,"(Korean Pronunciation: Cheong Wa Dae. Chinese Characters: 青瓦台）. Visited this attraction back in 2014 Summer. Easily accessible via Seoul Subway and must walk a distance. The friendly police forces will be able to guide you in the right direction in English too. I feel that that this presidential residence is set in a beautiful surroundings with hills in the back ground and a fountain in the main square facing the Blue House. There is a musuem whereby visitors can participate in a 3D interactive tour of the Blue House. There is even a replica of the Presidential Desk whereby visitors can sit in it and pose for pictures.Like in other reviews here, you can even take a picture with President Park whereby her image is being digitally ""shopped"" into the picture.", December 2014
42,5.0,Presidential visit,"When we arrived , there were convoy fleet stopping all tourists. Is this place a really working Presidential office or it is just a tourist trick? I am not sure...", October 2015
43,4.0,Get a closer look to the Korea Lady President,The exhibition hall is just next to Korea President palace. Very interesting and there is a big projector screen which you can walk to the President palace internal by animation effect ., September 2015
44,3.0,Official residence of the President of Korea,"We got to see it from the distance standing at the designated and naturally heavily guarded spot. The walk from the bus is pleasant. Partly through the park area, near the public relations office, by the allegorical sculptures, street lined with trees - all surrounded by the numerous agents Smiths (matrix). The public relations building houses free Korean culture exhibits, souvenir shop and lounge ( and bathrooms!).", October 2015
45,3.0,A quick stopover or visit should do - Blue House is SK's Presidential (White) House,"The Blue House is heavily guarded, much like our U.S. White House for the President and our tour bus dropped us off several blocks ++ away, for a morning breakfast first before walking us over to see it from a distance and for photo ops.  That's pretty much all one need, a guided tour inside will be restricted & limited for security reasons.  The House is framed behind the shadows of the mountain in the near distance - with the palaces in front on the other direction; and, is said to be the ying-yang and lifelife for the country's power, safeguarding the emperors and rulers since ancient times.  There are some photo scenic spots but during our brief stay on nearby grounds, far too many tourists running through with their escort/guides waving banners hustling everyone to move along.  If time is short, skip this & head for the palaces in comfortable walking shoes instead.", September 2015
46,4.0,worth to see this landmark if you are first time in Korea,"Behind Cheong Wa Dae is in a very beautiful mountain scene. Although we were not able to get in (but we enjoy to walk around the beautiful garden) and only allowed to take pictures in some certain spots, and take pictures of the Blue House from a certain distance, it is still a very beautiful pictures : a very beautiful mountain behind as a background, Cheong Wa Dae in the middle, both sides and front garden are surrounding with a lot of flowers and trees. If you are first time visit Korea, it is worth to drop by to see the landmark as the president office and house although cannot get in.", September 2015
47,3.0,Just another Big house,The area that the blue house is in is really the attraction...not the exuberance of wealthy politicians.Better to simply see it from across the street and hike the surrounding region., August 2015
48,3.0,No special to visit but the way to Blue house is beautiful,The blue house is always chosen to visit by tour guide because it's free. But i see no special to visit. I stand far from the blue house and stayed about 5 minutes to see it., November 2014
49,1.0,Waste of Time,"This is a Korean version of White House, where the president lives. But it is crowded, the tour is short and you have to wait very long time unless you know someone. And there are nothing special, since Korea has no glorious moment during its political history.", January 2015
50,3.0,Short tour with lot of wait time,The tour needs to be reserved well in advance.  The amount of time waiting for previous groups to go through and the security check exceeded the tour time which was barely 30 minutes.  You see the immaculately kept lawn and a closer look at the buildings (which can be seen from the outside).  Really wasn't worth the hassle and shouldn't be a priority if you're visiting from abroad.  All explanations are in Korean but they give audio guides to non-Koreans.  You also get a nice souvenir., July 2015

52,4.0,Great place to stay.....,"Went for the tours and it show that the palace is huge and very well maintain........we saw there are few houses to welcome state guest, nice view and big mountain at the background......", March 2015
53,3.0,You can only see the Presidents official residence from the outside,This is just a drive by. not sure how you get invited to see the inside. Not as impressive as the White House or other Presidential Palaces, March 2015
54,4.0,Official residence,This a drive by as part of our Seoul City tour to see the house which is the official residence of the president of Korea. Yes it is blue! Actually part of a larger complex of government buildings. No entry for the public. Came back on a different day to enjoy the walk through the area, July 2014
55,3.0,"I should say the ""GREEN HOUSE""","Just glad that we were able to see the BLUE HOUSE which is the residence of the President of South Korea. Took a picture of it from the distance. That time, we were not sure if admission is permitted to the public. I could see that the compound is very heavily guarded. Even though we were not able to get in, we really enjoyed the vicinity around. I am still confused why they call it the BLUE HOUSE, the color of the roof is GREEN :) I guess I have to do my research.", November 2012
56,3.0,"Close to Unicef headquarters, only visible by binoculars which you pay","The walk up to ""The Blue House"" was real nice, surrounded by beautiful gingko trees and secret service agents all over.  Maybe there is a scheduled tour you can take, but was only able to see from a distance.", November 2012
57,4.0,The Compound of the Presidential Palace,"Needless to say, we did not enter the Blue House, the official residence of the President of the South Korea, just like only a privileged few  were allowed to enter the Buckingham Palace in London, or the White House in Washington. But we still considered ourselves lucky for being able to roam about the compound outside the Palace.  That is because the compound was an out-of-bound area for many years due to historical and security reasons. The ground, which is adjacent to the famous Gyeong-Bok-Gung Palace, was opened to the general public less than 18 months ago. Nevertheless, the compound is still very heavily guarded, uniformed personnel could conspicuously be seen everywhere. Interestingly, the name of the presidential palace is written in the Korean and Chinese languages as ""The House with Green Roof Tiles"". It is beyond my comprehension how a house with green roof tiles has been translated as The Blue House in English.", November 2012
58,4.0,"I got a free presidential mug but, I did not go inside of any of the buildings","The grounds were very beautiful and but, you will not be permitted inside of any buildings at all. I was disappointed by that fact.There were many places you will not be allowed to photograph. I was still glad I went. You will be security scanned. The start point was difficult to find in my opinion. You will have to cue up to get your passport checked and then stand in line to get on a bus to the visitor/welcome center.At the center there are bathrooms to use before the tour starts, as there are no opportunities during. You will be given a video orientation and have headphones for your language to listen to.You will get a great tea cup as a gift when you begin the tour.The presidential museum was a definite plus...you can have your photo taken the with President and his wife! And also in seated at his desk!You have to book months in advance and tours start in June.", June 2012
59,4.0,elegant,Wish we could get closer.  Interesting standing of the guard, July 2012
60,5.0,guard everywhere :),"lucky me i was there while the head of Korea is inside the Blue house. I can see guard, security, police (you named it!) all over the places..", April 2012
61,4.0,Nice surroundings but nothing much to take picture of,"Take this tour if you are interested in the compound surrounding the Blue House, and if you have about 3 hours to spare in your trip. Security checks are tight here, so make sure you don't bring any sharps with you. They also give out free gifts when you enter, they gave me a Blue House mug. Nice gardens and trees everywhere, but there are only a few spots where you are allowed to take pictures, and you can only take pictures of the Blue House from a certain distance.", October 2011
62,4.0,A good insight into The Blue House,"A rare opportunity to see The President's Office compound and its beautiful garden. Of course, you will not access the Restricted Area within the compound. As a traveller, I rate this attraction very good and educational. An audio-visual presentation is launched in the mini auditorium to start-off the visit programme. Non korean visitors may request for a audio guide. Onsite commentaries provided by the leaders are only in Korean language. After the audio-visual presentation, the visitors are esccoted around the compound for a guided walk-around. The total time taken is approx 60 mins and a souvenir is given to all as a gesture of thanks and good memory. All visitors will need to register ahead of the planned visit via its website. Some personal particulars will have to be submitted in advance through email. There is no fee for this attraction. Get more details at this website ~ www.president.go.kr", July 2011
