0,4.0,Hold hands with K-idols,"I recommend this place to all kpop and kdrama fans! If you want to know how it feels like to hold hands with your favorite Lotte Idol, you definitely should not miss this.  I loved comparing my hand size to with the BTS members' hands and wow, I must say Jungkook's hand is so", December 2018
1,5.0,A must visit for any Kpop fan,"If you love Kpop, this is a must stop for you. Super fun place to see your favorite artists handprints, take instagram photos, and experience giant interactive videos. Groups to highlight are BTS, Super Junior, EXO, Twice, and more.", June 2019
2,3.0,only if you're a kpop fan,"not much to see, we only went on the ground floor.Kpop group's hand prints are there. If you touch them, the screen will show a short clip of that idol. Some ""hands"" were not working anymore though.", June 2019
3,4.0,Lively atmosphere,"Lively atmosphere, good crowd. Nice place to sit and spend some time. Soak in the atmosphere. Good photo opportunities.", August 2015
4,4.0,Take a photo,I and my parents takeA photo with mascot korean star here feel good and happy come here saw everything about korean star., June 2015
5,3.0,Only go if you're a Kpop fan,"I think the best way to describe Star Avenue - Nothing special. Sure it makes for a good fangirling moment if your favourite idols happen to appear on the huge lighted screens or have their cut out boards available for photo taking anytime, but other than that there's really nothing special or unique about this place. We went there and we expected the screens to rotate the appearances of the stars only to be in for a disappointment. Only go either if you're a Kpop fan or if you have tons of time to spare after shopping at Lotte Duty Free upstairs.", July 2013
6,5.0,Brilliant,"This is a really impressive presentation and worth a visit, especially as it is at Lotte and everyone goes to Lotte, right!!!", January 2013
7,3.0,A little bit disappointing,"We went here instead of paying for Lotte World's skating rink experience. We had some photos taken of Super Junior's, Kin Hyun joong 's etc. memorabilias, we had our little dubbing experience for You are beautiful, we had our compatability test with our favorite Suju members and we.... we were a little disappointed because we thought it was a big place but not at all. We felt that we wasted our money. We spent for a 15 minute of enjoyment. They should have made it bigger to maximize the fun. Although we had our chance to touch their hand prints, it was not enough to say that it is worth of our money.", October 2012
8,1.0,"A cheap, nasty imitation of the real thing","This is simply a cheap and nasty imitation of the Hollywood walk of fame.    However it simply doesnt work.  It is way over crowded, completely commercialised and very cliched.   Not worth your time, effort or money.", August 2012
9,4.0,Star Avenue ~,"If you like stars like Rain , 2pm , Big Bang and JYJ , this place is worth visiting and checking out. Here on display are items used by the stars themselves, whether when they endorsed something or used during their concert. They have the hand prints of the stars there as well . =)", January 2012
10,4.0,Hallyu Avenue,"I enjoyed my short visit to Star Avenue, and was pleasantly surprised the entrance to the enclosed area is part of the Lotte World admission fee.  Had fun with the stand-ins, the recoding room, the motorcycle ride with Song Seun Hun and the dress-up as Ju-mong.  A good time if you are a Hallyu fanatic. I just wish they had more Hallyu Idols in the dioramas. Most of the souvenir items are sold in the upper floor of Lotte World dept store , the Hallyu fanatics will definitely have a field day here !", December 2010
