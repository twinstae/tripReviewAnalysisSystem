2,2.0,Not much to see anymore.,Most of the murals are already faded.  The neighborhood is clean but there is really nothing much to see anymore.  There are also vandals written by the residents that they dont like tourist coming anymore because of the noise. Going there was difficult also even though I already hired a taxi from Bukchon Village., November 2019

5,4.0,Funky local art spot!,"My husband and I decided to head out to Ihwa Mural Village early Saturday morning. We followed the directions found on a few different websites to get there.  First things first...it's a good hike up the hill to get to the murals. Wear comfortable shoes! If you have small children just know that it is a walk and that there are even more stairs once you get in to the mural village area itself. Having read a bit about the mural village before going, I knew that a couple of the iconic pieces had been painted over. While sad, there are still more than enough murals to take in that we were not disappointed. The route up to the top and around Iowa Mural Village was well signed and helpful.  Some of the murals are a bit generic but there remained enough along the loop, which took us along the Seoul Fortress Wall for a spell, to keep us entertained.  There were a number of cafes with great views of Seoul.  We enjoyed our visit and would recommend this to people who have explored all the standard sights of Seoul and are looking to branch out to see things off the beaten path.", October 2019
6,4.0,Nice walk,"I stumbled upon this village almost by mistake after hiking along the Seoul Wall. It‚Äôs a great walk up and you can include a visit to the Wall Museum, which is interesting and entrance is free.

16,4.0,a break from all the shopping and commercial city,"It is an area within a village that is full of art murals.  Can take many photos and enjoy a cup of coffee there.  There are also a few cafes/ restaurants you can choose from, though quite pricey compared to the rest of the restaurants in Seoul.  It is in a neighbourhood that required some stairs/steep walking, so take that into consideration.  Also try to be quiet when visiting =)", April 2019

23,2.0,Not as vibrant as I imagined,Not a lot to see anymore. I understand that some artworks were painted over. Might have been a mistake to visit Gamcheon Cultural Village first since we couldn't help but compare., November 2018
24,4.0,Bohemian Ihwa Mural Village,"Ihwa Mural Village (Ïù¥ÌôîÎèôÎ≤ΩÌôîÎßàÏùÑ) perched at the top of Naksan Park, was once set for demolition as it was seen as a poor and down-trodden neighbourhood.  In 2006 under the ‚ÄúArt in City Project‚Äù carried out by The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, murals were painted to revitalize the area. Brightly coloured murals on walls, fences and rooftops were created by 70 artists to transform it into a charming and photogenic village. The Mural Village illustrates the ability of street art and human ties to breathe new life to the city. Many small museums, art centers and caf√©s have also sprung up to add to the bohemian feel. As one mural-hunt, remember that this is a place where people live and the daily lifestyle of residents should be respected. So, please don't intrude.", November 2018
25,4.0,A steep climb but nice murals,"The climb is steep and long but you Will be rewarded with nice murals and view OF The City. The houses are unique and The murals are varied in theme.

27,4.0,"Beautiful views, fun art, funky neighbourhood.","The views alone are worth the walk up the hillside roads to Ihwa Mural Village. It was 48 degrees C with the humidex the day we walked up to the village in Seoul and we were pleased we made the trek. The little area is quite charming and boasts some stunning views of the city. The quirky murals that dot the area are fun to see. This is NOT, however, a place for someone with mobility issues as there are many stairs, a steep incline throughout, and many uneven surfaces.", July 2018
28,1.0,Very Disappointing ,"Looking from the past review, we thought there will be more mural paintings to see. But they are all either already faded away or badly painted over. Not worth going at all. Don‚Äôt waste your time.", July 2018
29,3.0,Disappointing ,"Was looking forward to the village as had seen some pictures. Sadly the famous stuff like the steps were covered over. It's a bit of a climb to the top and kdrama fans can see Strong Woman Do Bong Soon's house which is apparently a museum but looked like a shop. It's also close to Naksan Park which is worth a look. Though there was some interesting art work, it was nothing special and really uninspiring compared to Gamcheon culture village in Busan (where visitors actually seemed to be welcome). We had some yummy milk ice cream at Milk Gongbang which was a cute little place.", June 2018

It's a very hilly residential area where artists have decorated many walls and stairways with cool paintings and mosaics. There are so many cute boutiques, restaurants, and cafes sprinkled throughout the area, you could easily spend all day wandering around. Everything is super Instagramable!

47,4.0,Great for art and hiking lovers!,"This place is like the Gamcheon Mural Village in Seoul. It's not as artsy as Gamcheon but it's quite good with beautiful paintings and art landmarks. You need to hike to see the fullest. They have maps that show special paintings or landmarks of the village. Special or you can say beautiful landmarks located at a  high level so get ready for a long hike. At the top of the mountain (just like Gamcheon, Ihwa is located at Mt. Naksan) you can find part of Seoul City Wall as the wall also cross the Mt. Naksan, Seoul city, and DDP from afar. There are cafes, small souvenirs shops, some street food stalls, and hanbok rental shops. You can buy a cup of coffee to enter one of the cafes and enjoy the view from the balcony.", June 2017

The popular murals like the fish and flower staircase are no longer there. It's covered with grey paint now. A pity. The whole area was quite interesting to look at, with little cafes and shops around. Not bad if you have time.. but we found gamcheon culture village in Busan more attractive.", April 2017

Lots of coffee shops and souvenirs can be found as well. One of the best spots to take pictures in all Seoul, March 2017
56,5.0,traditional atmosphere ,"A little bit far from the center of Seoul. But this place is definitely good. I was really impressed by Korean traditional atmosphere. And there're many people who enjoy wearing Korean traditional attire. Architecture, people, local restaurant, many things are so attractive here.", February 2017

59,5.0,Artistic beauty and a healthy body,"There are many murals drawn on the sides of people's houses. As the name says, it is a village. Therefore be sure to keep quiet when exploring the area. There is also some mini workshops, cafes and museums around the village, The village is also situated at Naksan Mountain, so make sure to wear proper footwear and clothing as there will be a hike up to the village and high stairs along the village", February 2017
60,5.0,Nice murals and art installations in a local neighbourhood ,"We were here on the 1st day of Seollal. Most shops were close. The neighbourhood is quiet eventhough there were tourists or visitors like us walking around admiring the neighbourhood and its creative surroundings. There were many graphics,  wall arts and at installations worth admiring and taking photos with. A few cafes with free wifi were opened when we were there so we had no problem having a good lunch at a nice warm place. We even get to eat hot sweet potatoes while walking up the neighbourhood. Walking around this area, you will experience and get to see how the working class in Korea used to live in the older days. If you are interested to stay within this area, there is a guest house - Rose & Candy Guesthouse with a View. I did not see the interior but u can check them out by calling 010 8828 3720. According to one flea market seller we met, on normal days (non-holidays and especially weekend), there will be many sellers there selling accesories and artistic pieces. The view - once you are at the highest point of the village is really nice. You should bring a good camera when you are here and put on good shoes as the steps are old grounds so they are not flat and smooth. There are many slopes and uneven ground so be careful when walking. Important thing to note is this is a local neighbourhood. It is a residential area. So walk quietly and do not make noise or litter the area. It is a public place so respect the environment.", January 2017
61,3.0,Cute murals!,"My sister and I visited the mural village after reading a blog about how cute these murals are decorated around the neighborhood. We walked around the village and took some pictures with cute murals. We kind of expected to see more around the neighborhood but maybe it was just us not looking closely enough. We didn't see many tourists since we went in the morning but we did see a few. As I was walking around, I started to feel bad for the people that live there since they don't get much privacy. There are constantly strangers walking around the neighborhood and taking pictures. I guess they're used to it but I would get annoyed if it got loud with visitors. My sister and I left right after we realized this is where people actually live and should be respectful of their space. Try to keep the volume low and be respectful of their property. :)", April 2016
62,5.0,Ihwa Mural Village,"A place that has many many spots for great pics.  Due to some local protests, its famous painted staircases are covered with cement.  However, there are still many beautiful hand painting to look at. Be more willing to walk more and explore the area wider than usual - is worth it.", December 2016
63,4.0,Cute!,"Cute place to spend an afternoon. There were not as many murals as I had expected, but there were some really nice ones. Fun to watch all of the local tourists taking loads of selfies.

70,4.0,Nice neighborhood,"Ihwa Mural Village has a bunch of beautiful drawings, and the drawings painted on wall or even stairs. But it's so sad that some of those drawings been erased due to some conflicts between the people who live there. In fact there are actual people and family live in there, so when it becomes famous alot of tourists come and go and it makes the neighborhood become crowded, and some of the tourists just easily go inside the house because they don't know there's a family who live there. So for you who still want to go here, please pay attention not to make noise while you're walk around and enjoying the neighborhood ;)", May 2016

72,5.0,Beautiful,I came to Ihwa with my friends. We walk for about 700m I think? Along the way we can see some clothing store and resto/cafe. The location is on top of the hill so we can see the beautiful scenery. The mural was great and i met an old lady who owns mini store and she was so friendly!, October 2015
73,4.0,Prepare your feet,"Bear with the steep road and long walking distance. but it worth a visit. Unfortunately during my time went there, the mural of carp fish on the stairs is not there anymore. probably they want to change the design. or or or maybe i the one who didn't find it. and some of the spot of this place is once drama shooting location. I enjoyed my time here as i also be able to watched seoul scenery from the top.Cool!", May 2016
74,4.0,Nice Place to Visit on a Monday,"With most tourist attractions and museums in Seoul closed on Monday, this might be a good alternative if you want to get out and explore the city.  I reached it from the Dongdaemun area walking along the Old City Wall heading toward Naksan Park.  While it is an uphill climb, to me it looked easier than the people arriving at Ihwa from below and having to traverse many steps.  As others have posted the two most well known murals painted on the staircases were vandalized and are no longer visible, which is really a shame.  There are some smaller murals and other sculptures like cats, roosters, and balloons that were fun to look at.  The view over Seoul also is nice with Namsan tower in the background.  There were a few shops, coffee houses, and restaurants too, although I really didn't stop at any of them except for one shop that also had a small museum that while closed the proprietor allowed me to take a look--that is where I saw what the destroyed murals (one of fish the other flowers) looked like.  Ihwa is a bit like the Gamcheon Culture Village in Busan but on a much smaller scale.  Right next to Ihwa is Naksan Park and I enjoyed the tranquility of the paths there as well as the city views and the views of the old city wall.  Altogether I probably spent about two hours exploring and taking pictures of both Ihwa and Naksan and would recommend this as something different to do in Seoul and a bit off the beaten path.", September 2016

When we were there the famous stairs of koi painting and flower painting were renovated.  I don't know if they are going to repaint it back the same way.  There was a building where local vendors sell handmade trinkets and jewelries.  There were 4 tables of vendors which they are not always the same vendors.  I bought bracelets from a guy who made them, he spoke really good english and very friendly.  Do buy fresh delicious milk ice ream from Milk Gongbang.   The shopkeeper was very nice helping us call the taxi.

So it was great for us to stroll around, enjoy the walk/view, cafes and shopping.  It was kind of expected but somehow finding the murals and taking pictures with them still excited us.

98,3.0,Nice if you are in the area,"This place isn't necessarily located in a convenient place near most hotels or other sightseeing areas so I would say it is only worth visiting if you are nearby or really interested in seeing a different, more quiet side of town. It is located near hyewha station but you do need to trek quite a ways away from the main action and into some pretty narrow paths up a hill through a quiet neighborhood to reach naksan park and the murals themselves. Depending on when you visit the murals might be in pretty good shape having just been repainted, or you might show up and find a mural that's barely visible because it's so faded and hasn't been retouched in a while.", February 2015
99,5.0,Street Art,"Walked around this area on a cold and rainy day. Not a easy hike up to the village but doable from subway station.

You can wander down to the adjacent park or see the old school for underprivileged students, where you can see locals renting the old uniforms and walking around in them! A great place for people watching also.", November 2015
110,2.0,Tiring,"In order to visit this village,we had to climb up the hill.It is very tiring.I was expecting it will be easy to find the art.But it is difficult to find it.To me,the art in the hse is not that amazing.Some of the art is in their hm.Quite boring", March 2015
111,3.0,Overrated.,"The murals are over-rated and a lot less than expected. Plus, there were too many tourists, which meant taking photos was difficult. The Seoul City Wall and Naksan Park were much more interesting.  Also, the locals tend to park in front of some of the murals.", November 2015

113,5.0,Cute place to explore and take pictures!,"Make sure to come here with a friend to take pictures for you. Lots of photo opportunities on every corner. Easy to reach by public transportation but the hill to get to the village is a bit steep. The street is rather narrow but that's the charm of this little ""village"", not too much traffic from cars. If you're into Kdrama, you may recognize of the places where dramas were filmed. Seems like a nice date spot too‚Ä¶lots of couples with matching shirts, shoes, etc.", October 2015
114,4.0,Nice stroll for beautiful mural art,"The Public Art Committee had artists to paint the walls and install artworks in this village to improve the area and since then it (including Naksan Park) is has been used as a filming location for Korean dramas (i.e. Rooftop Prince, King 2 Hearts, Angry Mom) and even one of the WGM episodes for Kwanghee and Sunhwa. The village (as well as Naksan Park) is now a growing tourist attraction as visitors flock to Ihwa for its beautiful murals and sculptures. It will not be easy to take photos anymore without someone else accidentally being in the picture. Go early, if that is what you want.", October 2015

116,4.0,A walk through laid back art,"Raring to see a laid back part of Seoul , then head to Hyewa towards Ihwa Mural Village , past Marronier Park. Murals along the walls of houses actually lived in by the locals. You get a peek into how they live and at the same time get a good view of Seoul. Having the chance to walk along a part of the Seoul Fortress wall is an added thrill.", September 2015

120,5.0,Fun walk in Seoul's hills,"A local brought me to Ihwa Mural Village, a fun neighborhood with murals and art tucked around every corner and on staircases in the hills. It was a fun way to spend an afternoon. The views of the city are stunning and there's restaurants and shops to pop into as well. Highly recommend for a place to stretch your legs, see some neat art and catch a panoramic view of the city.", September 2015
121,4.0,Really pretty and interesting village,"There are a few main murals to spot and the village is up on a hill so you'll be able to see the scenery around the area. Easy to get lost but there will be maps, if not, a mural of the map found to guide you along! One of the recent drama (The girl who sees smell) is also filmed there!", April 2015

But the murals and art are worth the effort and the views of the city are the icing on that cake. The area is a little confusing, small stairs and pathways but it's something I was happy to have done.", June 2015

127,4.0,Un unexpected facet of Seoul,"I love Seoul for so many reasons. It is diverse you never know what to expect: a mountain, a temple, a tower, a nightlife district, an old palace, a mountain... That is once again the case with Ihwa Mural Village. I kind of stumbled upon it while intending to visit Naksan Park. The village features lots of small and cosy houses full of coffee houses and shops and little art exhibitions... But the main reason why this place is famous is the multitude of murals. The neighborhood is full of murals (some are actually found on steps of stairs or on the ground, rather than on actual walls). The murals themselves are - for most of them - not overly impressive artistically, but what makes the place interesting is that you'll never know what you'll encounter next. Located on the side of a hill, Ihwa is full of small streets, slanted alleyways, sloped roads, which allows for all the murals to be approached from a different perspective, with a different background, and different ways to experience the wall paintings. Walking around a street and randomly encountering a new mural in an unexpected manner is truly an enjoyable experience.", May 2015

129,5.0,Great neighbourhood with lots of murals and lovely little coffee bars.,"A bit hard to find, but definitely worthwhile! We went to Hyehwa subway station and took exit 2. Outside, we walked straight ahead and took the first street to the left (at Dunkin Donuts). Soon we spotted the first murals, including one of a map of the area, very convenient (take a picture!).", May 2015
130,5.0,Beautiful happy place,"This was one of the highlights of our trip. Great location up the hill, beautiful view, cool/artsy neighbourhood. The narrow streets and the murals are just gorgeous. Right at the bottom there is the first president of Korea's house which you can visit (it was too late in the afternoon for us).", April 2015
131,5.0,Great to see in Seoul.,"This area was a joy to visit. Many happy children were there visiting as a excursion. The murals on the walls of homes and stairways were very clever, and a great photography opportunity. Strangely the hotel where we were staying and the taxi we hired did not know where this area was, even though it was close to the Insadong area that we were staying in.", April 2015

140,5.0,Colourful Paintings,"I wouldn't have known about this place without my South Korean friends.  Just up from Dongdaemun gate, following the wall there is a small district of mural paintings in Seoul.  Most of the murals are hand painted by the locals, and are fantastic to see.  The whole area is open to tourists and isn't too busy as it does requires a little bit of hike to get there, and the streets are quite narrow, so no big buses", July 2014
