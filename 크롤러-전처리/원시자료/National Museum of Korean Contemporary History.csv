0,2.0,Only tolerable because it's free,"One out of the three floors was shut for renovation.  Lacklustre exhibition, little English, little interesting objects. I'd recommend doing it if you know next to nothing about Korean history but this museum isn't exactly worth the effort to come here. From Japanese occupation", November 2019
1,4.0,Intro to Korean history,"A good introduction to Koreas recent history, all info available in English, albeit briefly but nevertheless still there. Some of the exhibition floors not in use presently but for a free entry museum it is a good use of time for those after some cultural capital.", October 2019
2,2.0,I’m Sorry,"I’m sorry, first and foremost that the best efforts of designers and planners and curators were insufficient in my opinion.  I’m also sorry that I don’t agree with other reviewers who gave it high grades causing me to visit.Let’s start with the most important thing:  the exhibits themselves.  Imagine, if you will, about 3 pages single spaced of text.  Now take a scissor and  cut it into strips horizontally.  Now paste one of these strips on each exhibit window.  There, you’ve got the text.  Now fill the space behind each window with a few old documents and some photos that were found or donated.  And now you have the essence of the museum.Second, for English speakers(and most people reading TripAdvisor are, I believe, English speakers), it is clear that not all of the text is being translated.  For example, 6 lines of Korean text is translated to 5 words in English.  Some of the videos do not have English subtitles.  At the main entrance to the building in which the museum is located, from the street you cannot tell that the museum is inside.  Only when you see it on the panels of the revolving door do you know that you are in the right place.  True, on the side street, the door is labeled clearly, but I suspect that I was not the only visitor who came on the main street from the line 5 subway station.And finally, the museum is undergoing some kind of renovation so that of three exhibition halls, only two are operative until DecemberIf you happen to be passing by, then you might choose to give it a try.  There is no entrance fee.  However if you have to make an effort to visit, give it a pass.", October 2019
3,4.0,Part 2 of National Museum,"This is the Korean contemporary history museum and is a continuation of the history of Korea from the National Museum of Korea. There are plenty of exhibits and so much to read about the Korean war. A great museum, clean, admission and audio guide free of charge. Good way to spend an hour. It is located opposite King Sejong's statue in front of Gyeongbukgung.", July 2019
4,5.0,Fantastic museum - free and open Mondays!,"Fantastic, well-located museum. Right next to palace and American embassy. No admission charge, excellent exhibits on Korean history from before the Japanese occupation through the Korean war to the present.  Really well done and informative, with panels in English and Korean. Also a beautiful view from the rooftop garden. Definitely worth a visit for any visitor interested in history - esp. on Monday when so few things are open but really on any day! They also have a children's museum section which we didn't visit, and a café with coffee drinks and baked goods.", July 2019
5,4.0,"Modern, clean, free and nice view.","The museum is modern, clean and very informative, although the information feels a little bit on the bright side. The view from the rooftop garden is perfect for seeing the castle and cathing the city's vibe.", November 2018
6,4.0,Eye openening experience,"There is so much to see and do in Seoul we almost missed it. On our way to the Gyeongbokgung Palace we noticed the museum. It was GREAT. Free admission and open on Monday. On entry, supplied 1 ID for 4 people to get audio guides. Takes at least 2hrs to see it all- unless your battery runs out - then just keep walking and reading. Texts are in Korean and English so no problems. A very interesting museum only problem was with the audio users I guess because my friends and I kept getting the wrong audio with what we were seeing. We kept saying “what number are you at? Why does it go from 103 to 108. Guess we should have picked up the guide before we started!!!  Has a Cafe and rooftop deck as well", November 2018
7,4.0,Fun museum to explore,This museum is very close to the main palace and free to visit. It teaches you about how fast S. Korea improved after the Korean War and you can see several Korean vehicles displayed along with household and electronic goods. Not as fun as the Seoul history museum but still enjoyable. The gift shop is worth checking out as well for some good souvenirs (shop around several places and do your buying on the last day)., August 2018
8,5.0,Modern Korean History,This museum is a must do for both Korean and non-Korean people. The turmoil and stress the country has suffered in the last 100 years is sobering to see.Outside influencers and world politics have played a huge part in creating the current divided nation. It certainly gives all the information on how things have developed and can fill you with sadness to see. The striving for a united Korea is something to hope for.Cafe has good food for a break or lunch., September 2018
9,5.0,Informative.,"We arrived at this museum about an hour before it was closing so had to move through it rather quickly.  It was very organized and interesting.  I am sure we missed some things due to time constraints, but was glad we had stopped in.", August 2018
10,5.0,"A century of turmoil, protest and capitalist triumph","Located within close proximity to a number of other Seoul highlights including the Bukchon Hanok village and Gyeongbokgung Palace, the free-entry Korean Contemporary History museum is an outstanding lesson in the country's at-times tragic history, tracing events from the start of the twentieth century as the country opened up to the world through international trade before a series of invasions, wars, the division of the north and south, the South Korean transformation into a manufacturing powerhouse, political uprisings and cultural shifts shaped the country we know today - all of which should prove an illuminating, melancholy and fascinating journey for the interested traveller. At the time of visiting, a temporary exhibition on the two decade history of the cellular phone in South Korea proved a fascinating step back in time. For me, this museum proved revelatory as I gained some insight into the war that my uncles fought in, came to understand how the division of north and south was characterised in popular culture, and learned how younger, educated Koreans rose up against politicians determined to seize power from the people. It is one thing to visit a museum; it is another thing to be changed by the experience.", July 2018
11,5.0,Informative,Nice to learn about South Korea’s history. Free admission.The rooftop is also for the win.Next time i will try to come during sunset. But since its summer their sunset is around 8PM., June 2018
12,4.0,Very informative,I'm a sucker for history museums. This was my last history museum during my trip to Seoul. I'm glad I came here last as it was the culmination from the past to present. I have such pride in S. Korea for the fact that they overcame so much where they are now., June 2018
13,5.0,Very good museum of modern history,"We were pleasantly surprised by the museum. Not only is it free, but it's modern, well maintained, and it covers the political and social history of Korea from the beginning of the nation to the modern place it is. It took use a couple hours to see everything. They have lockers to store your things on first and second levels as well as a cafe and restrooms. I would highly recommend this museum during your time in Seoul. The bonus is that is close to Gyeongbokgung Palace and the National Folk Museum.", April 2018
14,4.0,Good place to learn modern Korean history,"I enjoyed my first visit to this museum about five years ago. Then I knew a little about Korean history and in particular the events leaded to the division of the peninsula, the Korean War, and the emergence of modern Korea.There's still a lot of information there for those who want to know about how the country that makes Samsung smartphones and other electronic products, produces very good cars, and is one of the world's busiest economies.On this recent trip I chanced on a special exhibition about Jeju and in particular, the bloody events that took place in 1948,Jeju is marketed as a picturesque island (many Korean moves and TV shows are shot there) and locals and visitors are charmed by its beauty.But it has a dark past as this exhibition shows. I'm reasonably stoic but some of the exhibits were a little unnerving. So much bloodshed and death.I'll not spoil the story for you but at the entrance there is a screening of art associated with the events of that time set to music written specially for it. It's hard to remember but the title had Camillias in it. It was heart-wrenching stuff.I'm doing a little more reading on the subject but the exhibition tells the story well. Don't miss it.The regular exhibits are, as I have mentioned in an earlier review, very good. I'm a historian by training and was impressed by the even-handedness of the information provided.", April 2018
15,3.0,A Korean View of History,"For those foreigners who have studied Korean history from outside of Korea, you will find this museum to be a fantasy view of Koreans as to how they wish contemporary history might have been. Except, obviously, for the painful parts where Korea was occupied by Japan. The museum is long on what Koreans did to fight the Japanese during the occupation and short on what other countries did to actually free Korea from their Japanese oppressors. Overall an enjoyable two hour visit. And I was most impressed that the museum Curator was greeting guests upon their arrival. The exhibits are well done. The facilities are modern and clean.", February 2018
16,5.0,"Very interesting exhibition, recommended.","The museum occupies 3 floors. It is conveniently located almost across from Gwanghwamun Gate.The exhibition covers the recent history, mainly the 20th century. It is well and logically presented, with good lighting and proper signage with enough English. It is easy to navigate. I didn't know much about the Japanese occupation before my visit, I gathered a great info on the subject. I was also not aware of the sheer size of Korean shipping building industry - the museum has a great display covering it. There is the observation desk on the top floor, a couple of my attached photos was taken there. It is a great viewing point. The museum has a shop inside, escalators to move between floors. As all the museums that I visited in Seoul, it is well thought out.I am recommending a visit.", November 2017
17,5.0,Great!!,This museum shows the 20th century modern history of Korea.I really recommend it to eveyone.This museum is free. It's located near by the subway.You can see 3section(maybe 4?)of modern Korean history. It takes 1 hour to see everything there., March 2017
18,4.0,A very informative visit to know the Korean museum,The visit to the museum was very informative as the museum focuses on the exciting history of modern and contemporary history of Korea. It has a massive repository of valuable historic objects. Must visit if you're in Seoul., May 2017
19,5.0,Free museum,"This free museum is very close to the palace and if you go to the top floor, there's a great roof garden that overlooks the palace and the surrounding hills for great photos and views. The exhibits tell the story of post war Korea, right up to 2017.", October 2017
20,4.0,Korean History Museum Review,"Centrally located, easily accessible. Museum is well organized with expressions and directing signs in English. Worth visiting to have information on Korean history.", October 2017
21,4.0,Korean history 101,"I have immigrated from South Korea to the United States, therefore it was a great experience for me to review the 20th-century modern history of Korea. The admission to the museum is free and you can see a pretty good view of the surrounding area by going rooftop.The museum explored in details on the events in chronological order and even added the new section that honors the victims of comfort women from Japanese imperialism. It was a very personal experience for me to re-learn the contemporary history to understand my roots.Even if you are not from Korea, I highly recommend visiting this museum to get a better understanding of the modern history of South Korea!", July 2017
22,4.0,Supplements several other collections - a bit depressing!,"Several other museums in Seoul tell the story of Korea from neolithic times to ""the present"" but treat the period from 1945 - 2010 briefly, if at all. This museum focuses on the 20th Century, dividing it in several periods. There is a lot on the time under Japanese rule, with a not-unexpected dark tone. The rise of modern Korea is suitably interesting and inspiring. They had 2 special exhibits in early June--the lost an unknown Korean War soldiers, and calligraphy from an early independence proponent executed by the Japanese.  The views from the roof garden of the palace and surrounding area are great and worth a visit, even if all you do is go up the elevator! The museum is free and is a nice addition to a visit to the area.", June 2017
23,5.0,Important,Very important when you visit South Korea. Do the museum on the begining of your trip so you know basicly the history of the country in the last 150 years., May 2017
24,4.0,A good place to start!,This is a good place for someone who is wants to gain some basic knowledge of 20th century Korean history. I started with an elevator ride up to the 8th floor to the rooftop garden. This provided a great view of the Gyeongbokgung Palace from above the walls adding views of the mountains behind. Very nice security staff member tried very hard to help me with questions given my inability to speak the language. During my visit through the halls a couple of middle school groups made their way through with the expected exuberant behavior of young people freed from the the confines of the school building but in my opinion added to the authenticity of the experience! Worth the time!, May 2017
25,5.0,Just what I want in a museum,"This is the kind of museum that Seoul had been lacking. Its focus is contemporary history with plenty of visuals. It is nicely divided into 4 sections. It is not heavy on dates and names and there are plenty of pictures and objects. It is reasonably objective but does lean toward ""Through all the struggles and hardship we have endured and flourished because we are Korean"". There is a great children's section that my 3yo loved. It is free, provides free audio and you can print out a free photo. The courtyard on the 8th floor is quiet and offers great views over Gwanghwamun, the palace and Bukhansan. The four main sections took approx 90min to get around, could have stayed longer.", May 2017
26,4.0,Snapshot of Korean history since the Korean War,This is a good visual museum with exhibits mostly by decade.  It provides a nice overview of how far South Korea has come in the last 60+ years. Did I mention it's free admission. Worth an hour or two of your time., February 2017
27,4.0,Fairly objective,"Pretty much tells it like it is without going into too much depth.  Decent presentation s too, with a reasonable amount of text in English. Cafe attached.", April 2017
28,5.0,Recommended to assist understanding Korea.,"The period covered is from 1850 to present day. Admission free, headset with commentary also Free! This was a real eye opener for a non Korean especially for the period 1941 onwards. The South Korean people are to be admired for the adversity that hey have overcome.Try and do in the early part of your trip and perhaps before the DMZ tour.Highly Recommended", March 2017
29,3.0,Free admission,"The Admission: FREE AdmissionThe Museum: A museum of modern and contemporary Korean history showcase the late 19th century to now and also Seoul Olympics. The Location: Subway Line 5, Gwangwamum Station, Exit 2", October 2016
30,4.0,Nice history museum,"If you have to choose only one museum of history to go in Seoul, this is the one! It offers a good overview of the recent history since 1945, a period not covered by the National Museum of Korea and essential to better understand this country and its people. Of course the War Memorial of Korea offers a deeper dive into the war period, but if you lack time to visit both, I believe you benefit more from a visit to the National Museum of Korean Contemporary History.", March 2017
31,4.0,Contemporary,"Nothing special about this Museum, i been already to the National Museum which i think is the best, and to the War Memorial which is pretty amazing too. Anyways, this Museum tells you basically how Korea is who he is right now. Since the liberation in 1945 and the end of the Korean Ward towards the present.", February 2017
32,5.0,Walk through Korean history ,I thought I knew about Korea but this exhibition was great. Free entry the 4 galeries take you from the ancient emperors to modern day. Plenty of English and lots of of photos. I stayed for far longer than I had planned to and came out much wiser about some of the struggles the Korean people have gone through., January 2017
33,5.0,"A must for history buffs, or for understanding Korea","As I booked a trip to Japan for January 2017, I ended up with a nice layover at South Korea's Incheon Airport, long enough to let me head into Seoul for a few hours. Having previously called Seoul home, I wanted to pick a good sight as a refresher, and with the ongoing political scandal of President Park Geun-hye, I decided that visiting this museum, which deals with the series of events that led to the rise of both Park and her late father Park Chung-hee among others, was the right thing to do.- Overview -While most people tend to think of the old Korea from the royal dynasties, or the modern pop culture, not many people know or understand the Korea in between - the age of modernization and colonization, the story behind the division, the war, and South Korea's industrialization. This museum fills in the gap, covering the history of Korea from 1876.The museum is located right next to Gwanghwamun, in one of the twin buildings; the other twin building is the United States Embassy. It is easily reached via public transit; use the subway Line 5 (Gwanghwamun Station) for the easiest access, though Line 3 (Anguk Station) and Line 1 (Jonggak Station) also work.Admission is free!There are storage lockers on the second floor before the first exhibition hall; use a 100-won coin as a deposit to release the key, and the coin is returned when I am done with the locker and return the key.- Exhibits -Exhibit 1 on the second floor is primarily about Korea from 1876 to 1945, from learning to conduct diplomacy in a modern way to learning to pick national symbols such as a flag or an anthem. Having been locked into a Confucian diplomatic order for so long, where Korea considered it an obligation to be China's best possible vassal state, there was a steep learning curve ahead. The exhibits go through the opening of relations to non-Chinese states, the declaration of a sovereign empire, the steps that led to Korea becoming a Japanese colony (complete with the treaty documents), and the struggles of Koreans to regain their sovereignty.Exhibit 2, on the third floor, deal with the early troubles of South Korea, 1945-1960. The war was the primary challenge that devastated the nation, so there are exhibits that deal with war rations, American aid packages, and policy treatises of the inaugural Syngman Rhee administration. This section ends with Rhee's fraudulent attempt to win a fourth presidential term, which ended instead with a popular uprising that forced him to resign, complete with the campaign posters and Rhee's resignation letter. There is also an automobile here, in the form of the Shibal, the first South Korean automobile that was little more than cobbled parts of leftover war surplus American jeeps. Additionally, there also are some documents and exhibits that have to do with the other side of the DMZ, with founding documents for the Korean Workers' Party, the eventual rise of Kim Il-sung and the modern-day North Korea, and preparation for its invasion of South Korea.Exhibit 3 and 4 make up the 4th floor. Exhibit 3 runs to about 1990, dealing with South Korea's economic rise and political turmoils. The exhibit starts with the role of the museum's building, which then housed the national planning group of General Park Chung-hee, who had seized power through a 1961 military coup. Posters from the Park military government with anticommunist propaganda and work campaigns abound here, increasing in severity with time. There also are numerous exhibits of Korean manufactured products, showing the development of industries; they start with wigs (wig exports made up 9% of South Korea's economic activity in the late 1960s, and Korean wigs dominated American stores at the time), moving on to simple electronics, and eventually to more complex items like televisions and VCRs. And automobiles: two are here, one being a 1960s Kia 3-wheeled pickup truck based on Mazda design, and the other a 1970s Hyundai Pony that was Korea's first indigenous car. (Being a car buff myself and a Hyundai owner, I came here precisely to take photos of the Pony.) There also are newspaper headlines of key events of the era - such as the assassination of Park Chung-hee in October 1979.Exhibit 4 continues with the development of South Korea into the modern era, with the final ending of military dictatorships in 1987 and the start of democratic elections (complete with the highly contested 1987 presidential election posters), the rise of Korean pop culture internationally, and changing social structures in the form of declining birthrates and the rise of ethnically mixed Koreans. There is even a Hall of Presidents with photos of ten historic South Korean Presidents (the eleventh, Park Geun-hye, is not included as this museum was dedicated prior to her inauguration), facing in the direction of Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Presidential Blue House; I loved the view.- In retrospect -Due to my very limited time in Seoul, I had to hurry through the last exhibit hall. I certainly will need to return on a next dedicated Korea visit. But this museum was all that I had imagined it to be, then some. It is a good overview of the development of a country from a nobody into a world power, and a nationalistic brag sheet too; but considering what they have accomplished in the past century, the Koreans do have a right to brag. I also appreciated that while the museum is from the point of view of the conservative government and primarily reflects its propaganda, there also are strong voices from those who resisted authoritarian rule and made democracy happen - the very ones who often were (and in some cases still are) dismissed as Communist sympathizers.South Korea still has a lot of problems on its hands; the current impeachment proceedings of President Park Geun-hye has exposed rampant corruption, cronyism, and authoritarian mindset that still have not completely gone away. For that matter, Park Geun-hye is the daughter of brutal dictator Park Chung-hee, a hero to the conservatives but a villain to the democracy activists. But South Korea is a country that has been to hell multiple times - and has come back every time stronger than ever. As South Korea continues to build a democratic tradition, there will be many lessons for the world to learn. Perhaps for me too right back home in the United States, where Donald Trump will be my next President and he does not hesitate to belittle, and attempt to humiliate and silence, his critics, in a way too reminiscent of some of the past South Korean leaders. It's time for my fellow Americans, and freedom-loving people of all other nations, to take note and say no to authoritarianism of any kind.", January 2017
34,4.0,Nice Musuem & Interesting History,"Good and interesting museum just by the Palace. Interesting displays and information, and it really gave you a good taste of Korean history. I would recommend this to people who want to go to a History Musuem as it was better than others.", January 2017
35,4.0,Lots of history,"I enjoyed it, but did not get to spend much time reading the details as I was with my young son. Hope to return and have a chance to get more of the history.  Its free, so no reason not to visit if your at the palace nearby.", September 2016
36,4.0,A nice light journey through Korean modern history,"I walked in simply to escape the heat and do something on my last day - no exceptions always work the best when going into such museums. The exhibition is laid out on three floors and navigation is made very simple. With ease you are shown that Korean history has been rather bumpy and through several changes has become what it is now - looking modern while thinking remains more on the conservative side. You get a pretty good idea why Koreans are study focused and treasure education. The darker periods are addressed and surely there are still several wounds left to heal, something which I could connect with - the displays could be simple yet powerful.Was there a bias in the museum? Honestly there is bias in history in general and we can not change that. Personally I feel like the museum gives a great basis off which to go out and learn more.", July 2016
37,5.0,Gyeongbukgong,"Located at seoul, the entrance is around p120-150. Make sure to wear your most comfortable shoes. The place is really big, you can see different kinds of birds around. You can wear hanbuk (korean traditional clothes) i think you can rent it there, I didn't tried coz it was really hot! Make sure that if you want to take a photo you avoid yourself with so many tourists. Especially chinesse (you know what im tryna say)😡 luckily i had spots that they're not visible so that i can take a pictures without them pushing or blocking me. Haha bitter lang!😂", July 2016
38,4.0,"Informative, but a bit light","This is a good museum to get an overview of Korean history from about 1900 on.  There are english summaries of most exhibits, and lots of videos playing.  I would have liked much more detail, and perhaps it was there in the Korean text, but the English translation was rather brief.  Nonetheless, I learned a lot about modern history of these people who have struggled so much.  I was impressed that the exhibits didn't shy away from less than glorious episodes from their recent history.  I didn't know about the couple of hundred students that were killed in a pro democracy uprising, or all the military coups and attempts by leaders to become dictators.  it was worthwhile, but could have been even better.  If you try to read almost everything, as we did, give it about 1 1/2-2 hours.  It has a small gift shop, and supposedly a cafeteria, but we couldn't find it", June 2016
39,4.0,"Propaganda aside, a well designed museum","We Downloaded the free app and walked round this free museum. The exhibits were well put together and if you excuse a bit of propaganda and bias, you can learn a bit about Koreas bumpy political history over the last 111 years. The displays were subtle and not cluttered, and the audio guide useful as much of the museum is in Korean, although the main information boards are also in English. Periods covered from 1905 to 2013. The main exhibits stretch over three floors and can be covered in an hour if you are in a rush. I found the sections on Koreas Economic development particularly interesting.", June 2016
40,5.0,Worth the visit,"Admission to the museum is free.  A place to understand what has happened to Korea in the last 100 years.  We did the JSA & DMZ tour before going to this museum.  If you are doing the JSA & DMZ tour, you may consider visiting this museum to learn about this history beforehand.  Really wish the Korean can be united in peace.", May 2016
41,5.0,"Good insight, well presented",We wanted to know how South Korea looks into its more recent history and found a lot of very informative material. The level of information is really good and digestable in one afternoon. The items are well presented in a diversified way with modern museum design and technology. Great to see an Asian contemporary history museum that takes up a stance and says what needs to be said., March 2016
42,4.0,Lots of Interesting History,We went in here while waiting for out nighttime tour of the royal palace next door to it.  The museum had lots of interesting history info that I hadn't seen anywhere else., March 2016
43,5.0,I love this museum so much ,This museum continues to get better and better :-) i love the content and the set up and it's a perfect place to know more about Korean modern history. It's free and easy to find as it is right next to the American embassy at gwanghamun station. Please enjoy this great museum, February 2016

45,4.0,"Interactive, interesting museum","We enjoyed this museum & the interactive aspects. Our children didn't enjoy it as much as we did, but it was still worth while to take them. It is free & close to the palace. Very easy to find.", November 2015
46,3.0,National type of museum,Museum provides the history of korea from the opening ports to the contemporary era which aims at promoting national pride and vision., January 2015
47,5.0,Amazing museum,"If you are into modern art, just go there and have fun. If you afre a student or under 24, its for free. It was interactive, amazing exhibitions. Some of them very creepy, some of them gave me very powefull feelings.", November 2015
48,5.0,One of the best,"This is a fantastic museum to get a better understanding of Korea's contemporary history. It covers things from a very simplistic point of view, however if you are not familiar with Korean history it will walk you through with enough detail to not be oversaturated with minutia. The multimedia presentations kept it lively, and entertaining. Make sure you go to the roof top, it has a great vantage point overlooking the palace.", September 2015
49,5.0,Studying Korean War from a totally new POV.,"I did not expect any Korean museum to be even better than the Gogung Museum, but apparently I was wrong. It was an interesting experience visiting here, as I got to view the Korean contemporary history from a Korean point of view. If you've seen how the Chinese government presents the Korean War history, you would know how fascinating it is to do a comparison. Sometimes in order to avoid getting brainwashed by one government, it isn't a bad idea to study propaganda of both sides, and stay neutral.", July 2015
50,3.0,Learn morw about everyday life of Korea,Many representations of everyday life of Korea is present; not very interesting though you can easily complete the museum around 2 hours, June 2015
51,4.0,Interesting look at Korea's recent history,"This museum is conveniently located close to Gwanghwamun Gate and Gyeongbokgung Palace in the centre of Seoul. It covers the history of Korea since the late 1800s and tells the fascinating story of how Korea overcame colonialism, war and economic devastation. A large portion of the exhibits are Korean language documents, so are a bit boring for non-Korean speakers, but there is generally a good mix of photos, artifacts and information that give you information on Korean politics, economics, development and culture during the modern era. The highlight is probably the mock Presidential desk in front of a window overlooking the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Well worth a visit.", June 2015
52,4.0,"Heavy propaganda, but well-presented","This lesser-known museum in Seoul covers South Korea's history from the time of its independence in 1945 to relatively recently. Visitors proceed through several exhibit halls that display artefacts and news articles, with history told through several short explanations at each exhibit. There is also an external display (on the ground floor) that covers street protests and government corruption.The displays have a distinct feel of propaganda from the current government (especially towards the North and previous apparently-corrupt governments) but it gives a good slant on modern Korean history.The museum is open to 9pm on some nights, making it a good destination for ""after work"" visits. Free entrance. Depending upon your level of interest, you can get through it in an hour.", July 2015
53,4.0,Excellent museum that offers a glimpse at the real history of the country (rather than pageantry),"Foreigners are often treated to elaborate displays of traditional korean culture (from hanbok to old palaces to kimchi-making...). All interesting in their own rights, but not reflecting where Koreans truly come from and what growing up in Korea felt like.First of all, the museum is perfectly located on Gwangwhamun, and is in a nice looking building, though not overly visually impressive. The exhibition rooms though benefit from neat displays, interactive features, balanced lightning, that bring extra value to the whole experience. The museum is very interested, especially considering that it focuses on modern history and economic development. The cutoff point is 1945 (from the end of the Japanese Occupation). It's a great 2 to 3-hour journey through the troubled yet fascinating history of Korea. Since ""understanding"" is more important than ""viewing"" in a contemporary history museum, I wish everything was translated in English 100%. Some of it is, some isn' t, which is a bit of a shame since the the place opened in 2012. Finally, the museum tends a bit to elude parts of history that the country isn't fully comfortable with, such as how Japanese occupation (despite its atrocities) might have help jump-start the korean economy, or the lack of liberties through the history of Korea through 1987. Despite the lack of emphasis on these difficult moments, the museum still feels really relevant and is a must-go for any one interested in modern korean history", May 2015
54,4.0,Looks like the Boss'ocopter flew in (critical thinking skills req.),"Spent about 1.5 hours here; awesome time, free admission, GREAT artifacts, great blurbs for English Speakers on the side of exhibits (but get the headset if you're really into what each little artifact is about). Highly recommend. Gives a great glimpse of the Korea you're visiting. Probably not a little little kid's place – fifth graders and beyond would probably be fine.If you have enough reasoning to see through some things, then this is an awesome museum. Let me first get it out of the way by saying, yes, it's definitely biased – it's not quite propagandic, but it IS biased. For instance, there is a map on one floor that maps out the ""free world"" v. ""communism"", with one other color as the ""whatever"" category. Most of the map was the free world, with the exception of North Korea and Russia, which were marked as communist. True, but I wouldn't exactly call the rest of the globe ""the free world,"" especially with the recent political issues coming up in S.K. That's all I feel like I CAN say, if you feel me.Other parts are redeemed; for instance, one exhibit talks about Korea's rapid economic growth while the next exhibit counters that by saying that there were a lot of protests – workers were treated like crap, and were essentially stepped abused for this economic growth.", February 2015
55,5.0,Educational but Biased,"The museum is located within walking distance from City Hall. We kind of stumbled into it. I was expecting much since it's free but it was a lot better than I thought. The museum covers Korea from its ""discovery"" by the West, to Japanese colonialism, to WWII, the Korean War, the College Protest Years and ultimately Koreas industrialization into a modern society. I took Modern Korean History during college so I pretty much understood a lot of the topics. Still it was educational to see the actual documents and pictures during each historical event. Of course, the whole museum is a celebration of how awesome Koreans and Korea is and how the Japanese are totally horrible people second to Communists. Another interesting exhibit was one where the showed the migration of Koreans throughout the world. It showed how Koreans populated the world but completely left out the millions of Korean adoptees that Korea sent away. Again...it's a nice museum but completely biased as it doesn't atone for any of the atrocities Koreans committed against their own people but its still well worth the visit", January 2015
56,5.0,Korea's recent history well told,"Perhaps the thing that struck me most was that this museum presented a warts and all view of modern Korean history. There was no sweeping under the carpet of events that put the country or its leaders in a poor light.The museum is huge, as other visitors have pointed out. Entry is free and there are guided tours. As it is with most public museums in Korea, electronic devices are provided to visitors who miss or cannot visit when the tours are on. These are fairly easy to use if you are used to tablets and smart phones and very informative.Opening hours at the museum, which only opened in 2012, are Tuedays to Sundays from 9am to 6pm and until 9pm on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Last admission is one hour before closing.Exhibits, many featuring film and sound clips are arranged chronologically.Besides the main exhibition halls, there are smaller areas for ad hoc displays.The museum is close to the Gyeongbokgung Station (Seoul Subway Line 3), Exit 6. You could walk from Anguk station on the same line but it is a little further.A good place to visit if you want to know more about Korea's development in modern times.", November 2014
57,5.0,Excellent and well presented overview of Korean History,"If you are visiting Seoul, you should add this museum to your list.  The innovative, creative exhibits illustrate the history of modern Korea.  It is centrally located, next to the American embassy.  Four floors of exhibits show how Korea has become the advanced powerhouse and center of creativity that it is.", June 2014
58,5.0,great selection of natural and art history,the permanent exhibition is free entry but the special exhibition cost 12usd. i got to see Claude Monet's impressionism collection upclose and personal and it was amazing!!!, May 2014
59,5.0,This is huge!!!,"First, I was shocked of the museum's size. This is huge! The giant building was full of interesting exhibitions. And most of the exhibits were real. It is a good to learn Korean history in more depth!", March 2014
60,3.0,Modern museum boosting Korean modernity,"See the march of progress; see how far Korea has come in 20 years, 60 years, 100 years, battling the negative colonialist Japanese, then the negative communists, then the negative militarists, on the way to the current stunningly bright corporate present.  It truly is amazing progress, and yes many of the exhibits verge on the propagandistic, or at least boosterist.  But it is not jingoistic, and it includes strangely frank displays about various political failures.  And it's free, and conveniently located next to the US embassy and the free museum under the plaza, about the glories of the Korean alphabet.   The month of August has an extra portable building with an extra exhibit of videos and mementos of the Korean war.  Yes, the museum is clearly aimed at the Korean-speaking public; but the English labeling is reasonably well-done.  Worth a visit if you want to know the official Korean attitude toward their own history;  and you get to see models of all the old Korean cars and computers and televisions!", August 2013
61,1.0,Don't waste your time,"This museum has completely missed the mark.  The exhibits are primarily documents written in Korean with very little English explanations.  I go into more detail on my blog ""Bobby's Awesome Life"" where I write all about different things to do in Korea.  This is a definite skip~~  It is free but not worth your time~~  I have been living in Korea for 10 years and this new museum had so much potential and I was very excited to check it out when it opened but it just doesn't deliver.", June 2013
62,4.0,"Interesting place, worth a visit","First of all, this museum is free which I appreciated.  Basically the focus here is late 19th century Korean history to the present--end of the Joson dynasty, Japanese occupation, Korean war and developing a democracy.I learned quite a bit, though at times it felt more like propaganda.  I had a limited amount of time so I had to skip the exhibits about the most recent times.", March 2013
