3,4.0,Nice to visit a local market aimed at residents rather than tourists ,The market is a local community asset that the residents support in order to sustain it. It was good to visit such a market rather than only see a market aimed at tourists., May 2019
4,4.0,Enjoy this traditional market so much !! Street food time !!,"Walk within 5-10 minutes from subway station to this market and it's easy to find using Naver maps. During walks, there are some shop sell fruits or local food and products. Inside the market, there are stall who sell raw meat, vegetables, banchan (korean side dish), local food snack shop, etc.. well, it's a traditional market and you can find anything. I bought strawberry for 3000 Won (big pack, 24 pcs). Strawberry is big and very sweet. I eat famous kalguksu (noodles with broth soup) which cost me 3500 Won with a very big portion. The restaurant is not too big that I have to queue for 5-8 minutes and 1 person 1 order. You can't share the meals even though it's very big for my size. I bought odeng (fish cake) for 2000 Won 3 pcs and it's delicious also thick (not like the one I eat in Hongdae). Very chewy. I also bought rice with red bean which is very good also. Oh my ... I do have a larger stomach so I can eat all of the food here ... hahahaha...", April 2019
5,4.0,Korean Food Street,"Mangwon Market is a long sheltered street with shops at both sides selling all types of food. Unless you browsing at every stall and eating your way thru, one can cover the market in 1-2 hours. There are all types of food. There are cooked and raw food, meat, vegetables, seafood, fruits, marinated food.We had a pork and chicken culet near end of the market and the meat was great.", March 2019
6,2.0,Not for tourist,"We went here on Monday, 24 Dec 2018. It is difficult to find this market. We have to walk about 10min from mangwon station and there is no sign to this market from mangwon exit. We have to ask several person to find this market. Just a local traditional market with limited foods. 3 Odeng = 2000 won ( cheaper than odeng in myeongdong @ 2000 won )", December 2018
7,5.0,BEST alternative to Kwangjang Market,"Although I love the Gwangjang Market, it is extremely busy and tourists tend to make walking through very difficult. This market has delicious food for much better prices. Short rib patties, mandu, famous fried chicken, croquettes, hotteok, fermented stingray, kalguksu and so much more ready-made food. There is even an Isaac's Toast without the busy line. He location is so good if you are near the world cup stadium or Hongdae area. Much better choice for those serious about the food scene!", November 2018
8,4.0,Covered traditional wet market,"We were staying in an Airbnb just adjacent to the market so as I really enjoy traditional markets it was perfect to go explore this one. The market is very long and mostly covered with all kinds of interesting produce from fresh fruit and vegetables to meat, seafood and kimchi and dimsum and so much more. There were stores selling aquariums, shoes, hardware and there were mini supermarkets too.About halfway down there are public toilets as well as a park and some eat places. The places selling food can be found all around the market, but the best time to get really delicious street food at the market is at night time when the market really comes alive.This is a local market in a residential area, but a pretty huge market. If you are into traditional wet markets then this is a nice one.", July 2018
9,4.0,Great local people market with delicious food stalls,Stopped at Mangwon market on a bike tour. A very interesting insight into how local Korean people live. The food was delicious and their speciality is fried chicken although they do have stalls for all manner of different types of food. Itâ€™s relatively inexpensive but I would recommend trying the spicy chicken before you buy a box as it is HOT!!, August 2018
10,5.0,"Local wet market, original and authentic","This market is far from city. However, it is a very local and authentic wet market. You can see the local shop and done here. If you want to understand local Seoul peoples living, this is a highly recommended place to go.", June 2018
