3,4.0,Pretend you're in a period K-drama,"Rent a hanbok and soak in the ancient Joseon vibes of the palace. Plus, entrance is free if you wear their traditional costume. Place was crowded though so no way you can grab any photos without a photo-bomber. Grounds can be covered in 2 to 3 hours depending on how interested you are in the place. Don't miss the changing of the guards ceremony at 10 am or 2 pm, but if you do, there's an hourly mini version of it", October 2019

11,5.0,Top must visit in Seoul,You must get a ticket to get in the palace. Its totally worth to visit. Try to spend 1 to 2 hours here to discover this beautiful palace., February 2020
12,5.0,Incredible palace that represents the heart of Korea.,"First Seoul and Korea were not our visit destination. We visited during a layover at the Incheon Airport. If you ever have a long lay-off and land before 8:00, do this tour. I could not stand the airport for 8 hours. I researched about how this was the principle palace of the last dynasty Joseon to rule Korea in 1395 and how it was rebuilt in the 19th century after 300 of non use. In addtion, this is the site of the Japanese seat of government with its capital building on site that also served as the first seat of government for the Korean Republic. While historically those all are true, the reason to visit is an amazing building that is incredibly painted with a series of gates and buildings that truly speak to the soul of Korea. The setting between mountains and the city is amazing and the juxtaposition of the palace to modern Seoul is stunning. The gates and the palace are the stars but the dining hall on the pond is an incredible building in a beautiful setting. The day we visited though it was cold, as there was ice on the pond. We really only got to see one thing in Korea but I have to believe we saw the best thing with the most historical impact. Go and take the tour.", February 2020
13,5.0,Getting lost on the palace grounds ,"Great for those who want to know more about the history and culture, and no you don’t really need a tour guide if you just want to take pretty photos and they had traditional wear for rental as well", July 2019
14,5.0,Mesmerizing architecture and must see if you visit Seoul!,Beautiful architecture and mesmerizing to see and visit. Parking is comfortable. Easily reachable via subway. Food market very near the palace. Can rent Hanbuk for small amount and take beautiful pictures inside the palace. The palace is a marvel of Korean history. Must visit if you are in Seoul. You may need 30~40 minutes to skim but I recommend longer stay and see the beauty in the marvel., May 2019
15,5.0,Great way to step back in time,"Highly recommend getting a guide, as the information brings the Palace to life! We got there by 10 am to seeing the changing of the guard. We learned about the gates, the Palace, how the king and queen lived, and so much more. Great palce to get pictures.", February 2020
16,5.0,Amazing and Relaxing Day Trip,"My wife and did Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Presidential Office the same day. Gyeongbokgung Palace was built in 1395, so it is good historical site. The day we went you saw so many people from so many different nations. The Presidential Office was a great tour. I caution you to reserve a ticket before you go to South Korea. They have a mandatory 14 day advance on reservation. You will also need your passport during the tour. This is where the President of South Korea works and lives. After both tours, we enjoyed lunch in the area.", June 2019

20,4.0,Enjoyable way to kill 1-2 hours,Saw many people in hanboks which I thought added to our overall experience.

21,3.0,Ancient place,They also have free guided tours at few intervals of day.Local wear traditional attire while visiting this place., February 2020
22,5.0,Beautiful,"In my opinion this is the best palace in Seoul. I would reccomend renting a hanbok from across the road if you can since they are beautiful, and entry to the palace is free if you are wearing one. The changing of the guard ceremony is cool to watch. The vibe of this palace is very touristy with many girls taking pictures in their dresses however this is a must if you want to take breathtaking pictures of Seoul. This was one of the highlights of my trip!", June 2019
23,4.0,Nostalgic,Super awesome place! I really love everything from here . Would like to go back again here! Super worth it, January 2020
24,5.0,"Very Vivid, Well Located and Colorful Palace.","Gyeongbokgung Palace, the ""Palace Greatly Blessed by Heaven"" was the first palace built by the Joseon founder in 1395.As far as we understood based on our tour guide; the site of Gyeongbokgung Palace was at the heart of Seoul and deemed auspicious according to the traditional practice of geomancy. Gyeongbokgung Palace provides a glimpse into Joseon's royal culture, palace life and architecture.This palace happens to be the largest of all five grand palaces built in the Joseon Dynasty, remaining in Seoul. The palace is beautiful for visits in all four distinct seasons in Korea.Visitors can enter Gyeongbokgung Palace through all four sides of Gyeongbokgung Palace. Gwanghwamun Gate (main gate) on the south, Yongchumun Gate on the west (newly opened on 6 Dec 2018), Sinmumun Gate on the north and National Folk Museum of Korea entrance on the east.Another relevant info is that the Gyeongbokgung Palace was destroyed by fire during the Imjin War (Japanese Invasions, 1592-1598), and the site remained vacant for the next 273 years. It was later restored during the reign of King Gojong.We were there around 12:00 noon therefore you must see the change of guard as it is a must. You can see my pictures here as I place some for this particular matter. I’ll try to upload a video although a bit long, very interesting indeed. Enjoy it as we did, although I have a feeling if we went in Spring the trees and flowers would have bring a more dramatic and pleasant look to the premises. But I don’t complaint as thank God the day was sunny and the temperature bearable. Definitely a must go place during your stay in Seoul.", January 2020
25,4.0,Beautiful palace and grounds,"We went in January so it was too cold for us to go around in the traditional Korean outfits. A lot of people were braver than we are (if you are wearing the outfit, you get to go in for free), so we saw a lot of people walking around in traditional Korean wear and it was cute to see. The grounds are pretty so it is nice to walk around and enjoy the view.", January 2020
26,4.0,Saw the Entire Grounds!,"I’ve read that access to the entire grounds isn’t free.. but that wasn’t the case when we went. Maybe the entire grounds were open for the Lunar New Year?The architecture was magnificent and seeing the old palace with the new urban city in the background was something else!We also stumbled upon the changing of the guard, a very interesting ceremony.", January 2020
27,3.0,The exquisite building was under maintenance,It was rather small and the inside of most buildings could not be viewed. The highlight of the site was currently under maintenance., January 2020
28,5.0,A bit of history in a modern city,"This palace is from the Joseon dynasty, located in the Jogno district. They have the royal changing of the guards ceremony at the main gate (check timings). Once inside one can just stroll through the different courtyards, view the various buildings or take a guided tour. Just outside the palace gates you have many Hanbok (traditional Korean dress) rentals. You can dress up and have pictures taken inside the walls of the palace. Hanok Buckchon village is also within walking distance. There is also a cultural street lined with traditional Korean restaurants.", December 2019
29,5.0,Family visit to Seoul,The palace is relatively small compared to most Chinese or western palaces.. Tour guide told us that’s because it was Confucius influenced but we got to see changing of the guards and our guide was so detailed that made the visit so much more interesting, January 2020

34,4.0,Changing of the guards!!,"I've seen so many palaces already, that this is the only one I decided to visit during my trip here. The complex is huge. It's nice to walk around. I was a bit dissapointed that the teahouse all the way in the back was under construction. Lots of girls and a few men were dressed in traditional clothing. You can rent those nearby and I read with them, the entrance to palaces is free (this palace is 3000won). Lots of good photo opportunities and especially away from the main palace it was nicer to walk around, less people. Try to see the changing of the guards! It's outside the palace so free. I think 10, 11, 13 and 14.", January 2020
35,5.0,Holding Court,The Palace is a piece of history in the quiet setting in downtown Seoul. I dressed as a Palace guard in traditional garb., January 2020

It was awesome and very colorful. Wondering how the guards kept warm during wintertime? Highly recommend to visit", December 2019
39,3.0,Worthy place to Visit,"A rich in cultural and historical value place to visit.Lots of visitor tourists during the winter holidays. A must visit to their HISTORICAL AND Cultural Museum located directly within the Palace vacinity. The museum inside is clean, quiet and warmy-heated during the winter .Has free locker service to accommodate our outer winter wears etc. Another tourist attraction free for viewing.", January 2020
40,5.0,Largest palace in Seoul,Maybe it would be more crowded in non winter time. I was surprised to be the only few souls wandering in the largest palace in Seoul in December.There are many different buildings aside from the main hall. Do get the brochure to understand what each of them signify., January 2020
41,5.0,Must see!,Really beautiful palace and gardens. Not to be missed. I took so many good photos here.  You will learn a lot about architecture and the royalty during the visit., March 2019
42,5.0,Spend a half day,"It is one of the largest palaces in Seoul. There is a lot done in regards to restoration which in some parts is maybe to shiny, shiny. The new and more remote areas feel almost like a fake movie set. However the main areas are amazing but after a while it feels the same due to the same colour scheme and structures. You do get a good feel of the history.Having visited the Forbidden City not much will ever compare. In Autumn the trees have beautiful colours so spending half day wandering was great.", October 2019
43,5.0,Nice palace to experience Korean history ,The palace is well visited by tourist and locals. Do not miss the 2pm change of palace guards ceremony. The ceremony takes place outside the gated zone but getting a ticket to visit the palace is totally worth it. The place is huge and we spent at least 1.5h walking around because we wanted to fully explore the gardens and rooms. It might be a good idea to rent hanbok costumes for the visit., December 2019
44,5.0,Just went again -- love it each time,Want to go back in time and enjoy Korean History -- always a top site on my visit list each time in Korea., December 2019

46,5.0,Amazing site to see,"This palace is so much more than it appears to be from the street! It is massive! While many of the building are similar, guided tour helps sort out what buildings were used for what. The changing of the guards was colorful and worth working into the schedule. Great day of walking and learning!", December 2019
47,4.0,Good but not great,"It is a good place to visit during your free time but not to a great place to explore. I have lots of more beautiful places like that when I was in Mongolia, so it wasn’t really woow.", July 2019
48,4.0,Huge Palace nice guard change,Went to the palace on a Saturday braving the public protest. Witnessed the guard change which was quite impressive. The palace grounds were large and massive but as unguided found it difficult to appreciate, December 2019
49,3.0,Too humble a palace despite being the biggest in Seoul ,"Nice stroll around but in terms of palaces, it is nothing to wow your senses after you have seen forbidden city in Beijing. They have lovely pine trees there though.", January 2020
50,5.0,A must to visit when in Seoul,Expansive palace with regular change of the guards at the entrance. This traditional palace right in the centre of the city is amazing. Tourists and locals alike rent the traditional Korean costumes when roaming around takes you to an atmosphere of several centuries in the past. A traditional village nearby is also a must to visit. Unfortunately my visit was cut short by heavy rain on the day. Need to go back again in summer when it should be very enjoyable., November 2019
51,4.0,amazing place,such an amazing place to visit. we got a chance to wear a hanbok and moved around the palace..like we transfered back to Joseon Dynasty..love the feeling so much., December 2019

53,4.0,A Must-See when in South Korea,"This historical place is every tourist's destination! Albeit all the tourists coming in, my fiance and I found the place amazing. It will take you about 2-3 hours to tour the entire palace! Our only regret is we didn't bring a selfie stick so we had little pictures of the place with us in it. The entire palace is an interesting sight. We did not regret coming here. :)", January 2020
54,5.0,One of the 5 royal palaces,"As really beautiful palace but full of tourists wearing Hanbok in the afternoons. For a quiet time, arrive early (e.g. when it opens). There's a museum towards the left of the Gwanghwamun gate and it's free admission. King Sejong and Admiral Yi bronze statues are a must visit too.", December 2019
55,4.0,Palace,Beautiful grounds. Historical and informative. We especially enjoyed seeing all the folks wearing the traditional folk dress., September 2019
56,5.0,Well worth it ,"Make sure you take in the changing of the guard, we did the 1030hrs. Also do not miss visiting the museums, both are well worth it; best to set aside most of the day to do the museums justice.", December 2019
57,5.0,Impressive ,My husband and I walked here from Insa-Dong area. The Insa-Dong visitors center was very helpful and provided us a map to the palace. This place was very cool. Cost $6 usd which is very reasonable. There were lots of visitors but it wasn’t so crowded that it made the visit unenjoyable. The museum on the premises is very helpful with providing more information about the palace that isn’t explained on the grounds., December 2019
58,5.0,Beautiful palace,"Very beautiful and historic. Take the time to understand some of the history and try to put yourself in that time. It was so cold the day we visited so we wondered how they kept warm, from the servants all the way up. The artwork on the buildings is beautiful. People dressed in traditional clothing made the experience all the better.", December 2019
59,5.0,Eye opening Palace,"This place is huge, elegant and historical. There are a few guards changing event, but the main event happen @ 11am.", December 2019

61,5.0,Fantabulous Gyeongbokgung Palace ☺️,"Gyeongbokgung Palace was the first and largest of the royal palaces built during the Joseon Dynasty. Built in 1395, Gyeongbokgung Palace was located at the heart of newly appointed capital of Seoul (then known as Hanyang) and represented the sovereignty of the Joseon Dynasty. Beautiful architecture and they restore the building quiet well after the first palace was invaded by the Japanese back in 1945 - 1948 where Korea was attack, much of the building in the palace was run down and destroyed, they were moved to the second palace in Cheongdeokgung Palace. There were beautiful matching presentation to shows how the army and General March during the dynasty and how they serve the king during Joseon Dynasty. Lovely wonderful place ☺️☺️☺️", December 2019
62,5.0,Beautiful,This is a must see place if visiting Seoul. Could have spent a whole day there were it not for limited time. Would love to return., October 2019

64,5.0,Very cool Palace and grounds,"Very beautiful grounds and buildings. Most fun was visitors dressing up period costume (guess they are available for rent) and taking photos, etc.", December 2019
65,5.0,Winter visit,It was a beautiful place to spend your day walking around this palace. It is clean but no food available. Entrance fee was reasonably cheap. It is near hanbok village. Great experience for my family., December 2019
66,5.0,Rent hanbok and walk around with free entry,Easy to locate the rental hanbok stall and short 3 mins walk to the palace. Saw the guard changing ceremony. Guards look so cool and good looking! Ha!, December 2019
67,5.0,Essential Korean Pageantry & Color,"An essential part of any visit to Seoul.  Unsurprisingly, the palace is a smaller version of the Forbidden City in Beijing.  If you are wearing traditional Korean costume (hanbok) you get in for free, so when we were there about a third of the visitors were wearing traditional Korean garb, which gave the whole experience the feel of being at a masquerade.  Do  not miss the changing of the guard at 10:00 AM.  There is an adequate English tour at 11:00, at no extra change.", November 2019
68,5.0,Best palace to visit in Seoul!,"If you're visiting Seoul just for a day, do not miss Gyeongbukgung Palace. Also wearing a hanbok allows you free entrance on most attractions in Seoul.", December 2019
69,4.0,Beautiful environment,"Such a beauty palace and plenty of nice places to take pictures(especially if you have rented a hanbok)!Protip: it cost 3K won to enter the palace but if you wear a hanbok, you get to enter for free!", December 2019
70,5.0,A must see!,Very inexpensive and gorgeous grounds to explore. Don't miss seeing the changing off the guards. My teenagers loved it!, December 2019
71,5.0,Beautiful architecture,"Beautiful architecture, it is somehow like a scaled down version of the Forbidden Palace in Beijing. Missed the change-of-guards though. If you are one to look at details, you can spend a whole day here. Entrance to palaces in Seoul are considered cheap. This palace entrance fee is KRW3,000 but I opted to purchase the package that include few more palaces as well for only KRW10,000. Weather was pleasantly cool in November, and the autumn leaves are stunning", November 2019
72,5.0,A Must visit in Seoul ,The Palace was huge. My family and I went there pretty early to take photos. A must watch is the changing of guards., December 2019
73,4.0,An insight into the historic past,"It has some semblance to the Forbidden City but on a smaller scale. Dont miss changing of the guards that takes place at intervals.  Two types of tickets: palace only at W3k and a 4-Palaces combi ticket at W10k. We went for the cheaper one. The main throne hall sits majestically in the centre with other buildings behind, linked by covered walkway. Behind the complex is a garden (I imagine it would be beautiful in summer) and a stream. There is a souvenir shop and toilet. There dont seem to be a place where we are allowed inside so we only take a peep through the window. An experience to immerse yourself in the imperial Korean times.", December 2019
74,5.0,Good photo shoot for Hanbok,The place is quite big but not as big as Forbidden city. But the place is spacious for foto shoots. Better wear themed Hanbok for contrast on the building color. Use the Discover Seoul Pass for your hanbook it’s a wise choice., December 2019
75,5.0,The Change of Guard was entertaining,"We eventually found this place - got mixed up with other Palaces.  We watched the Change of Guard and got some pictures before they moved off then did the English tour (free).  Our guide was easy enough to understand but we felt her english was very parrot - struggled to answer non scripted questions.  Having said, that the tour was informative and took us to lots of different areas of the Palace.  We spent just under 4 hours in total exploring.", October 2019
76,4.0,More for the atmosphere than the authenticity,"Meticulously reconstructed in the heart of Seoul, this visually impressive site is worth a visit for the crowds of Koreans (and some Chinese) walking around in Korean traditional costumes and for the contrast with the skyscrapers in the background. OK, most of the woodwork is modern, but the actors and the costumes make it quite an experience. Great for western kids.", November 2019
77,5.0,Well maintained historical place.,"It was a great feeling to visit such a well maintained historical place like ""Gyeongbokgung Palace"". Recalling the history by visiting the entire place, palace after palace was eunique.", October 2019
78,5.0,See their guard changing,"Visited this place 2x last month since i didn't know you can't go deeper inside into the palace. In case, if anyone wants to see their guard changing time, 10AM and 2PM", November 2019
79,3.0,Crowded place even in winter,"We were lucky to visit this place on a sunny winter day.  Surprisingly, the place is crowded with tourists and it was a challenge to take pictures in the Korean traditional costume.  If one wears the traditional costume, then one can enter the palace for free and there are a lot of lovely spots for photo sessions.", December 2019
80,5.0,Be transported back in time!,"Amidst the hustle and bustle of the city outside, the palace remained serene and one felt like being transported back in time as it has retained its beauty of long ago.  What was most interesting is people walking around wearing the traditional Hanbok added to its charm. It's a must see when in South Korea.", November 2019
81,4.0,Hanbok,"An excellent day was spent on a days escorted tour of Seoul with a lovely guide whose English was very good.The day started with a visit to a store where we were all dressed in Hanbok , beautiful traditional Korean costume for our visit to the palace.Make sure you are there by 10 am for the colourful changing of the guard ceremony.The Palace itself is lovely and reminiscent of the Forbidden Coty in Beijing , just on a smaller scale. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes as there is lots of walking involved", November 2019
82,4.0,Nice,Nice Place but I just could not get excited about it cos it is not the real thing cos its was rebuilt. A must visit when you ate in Seoul. Try to spend the day around that area. A lot of restaurants and beautiful cafes around the area., December 2019
83,5.0,Take the Guided Tour,What a wonderful place and so full of history.  We took the free guided English tour and she was fantastic.  Funny too.  I learned so much that day.  Such a pretty place., November 2019
84,4.0,Impressive palace,"This is a very large open area. The buildings can only be viewed from the outside. I find it amazing that the colors seem so fresh while being exposed to the weather. It was interesting to see so many tourists dressed in traditional hanbok costumes, especially when they are taking photos of each other. Didn't know that was a ""thing"" until later. The changing of the guard is an interesting ceremony to watch.", October 2019
85,5.0,Nice place to sightseeing,"It is a magnificent building in the middle of a modern buildings. It is easy to locate and nearby got great ginseng chicken soup. If you are not shy, you can rent a hanbok to walk around in the palace. A lot of tourists did that!!!The place is clean and easy to walk around, there is guides if you need one. Free entrance if you wearing hanbok. Overall is a great place for sightseeing", December 2019
86,4.0,They should charge more.,"This is a large expansive complex that really requires at least three hours to experience.  And with the ridiculously cheap admission rates, you will definitely get your money's worth.  A lot of people (locals and tourists alike) enjoy renting traditional Korean clothes (hanbuk) and often mill around throughout.  Photos are accepted; just politely ask first.  It really is a 5 star attraction; I am just not into this type of thing and would rather spend my time in a local neighbourhood hanging out which is why I gave it 4 stars.", November 2019
87,5.0,Beautiful place,"Highly recommended to take the free guided tours available. We took the English one and the guide brought us deep into the palace grounds where there were hardly anybody. She also gave a very good background to tje history of the palace and gave us some insight.There is a pre-parade at 945am at the right gate (if u are facing the palace) towards the open air carpark & public toilet. That is worth watching and not many people know about it. After the pre-parade is over, u have sufficient time to walk over to the main parade square to watch the changing of the guard. Best spot is on the left of the kids only area and facing out towards the main gate and main road. Here u can watch the guards marching in from the left and moving towards the main gate.", November 2019
88,5.0,Who love taking phots,Let 's go to Soul. The amazing place that many travellors love to visit.  Many youngers   with beautiful costume walk around there for taking beautful costumes., November 2019

Some tourists rent traditional Hanbok dress, a traditional Korean clothes. Rental prices vary depending on the time starting at around 13K to 15K Won for about 4 hrs.  It adds to the total experience you could get while walking around this historical palace not to mention it adds beauty to your photos and videos. Between 10 to 3 PM the traditional changing of the guards occur every hour which is a spectacle of Korean culture and tradition.

There are many areas you can explore in Gyeong-bok-gung. (Gung means palace in Korean.)The palace is very big so if you want to cover exploring the whole palace, give yourself the whole noon till evening, to visit this place. There are some description of each building and areas to read but not a lot to read. If you want to learn more about each area and building, it would be good to have a guided tour in your own language. The little description placed there are not very detailed and do not explain much about the whole place. I went this palace about three times on three different tours and each time was different. With a tour guide, you would learn why the floor is sand and stone (so that the guards could hear if someone is around to prevent assassination.). Without a guide, the floor would seem like it is just bare from tourists stepping all over.You could enter the Palace for free if you are wearing a Korean traditional costume!You could rent a traditional Korean costume from nearby shops just outside the palace. Try to rent them online in advance and go there early to collect them. The rental packages usually comes in 2 hours, 4 hours,  6hours or one day rental. And they are considered very cheap and affordable to rent! I had a 4 hour rental with additional 2 free hour package for only 24 SGD. And because the shop was very near, I changed into the costume and entered the Palace in just a 5 minutes walk. And after visiting the palace and taking photos in the costume, we went back to the shop to return it and changed back. The whole process was very convenient.", December 2018

You'll get a better view of everything if you're at the front of the crowds.  This event takes about 30min.

159,5.0,Historic and Vast,"We visited this gorgeous palace early on a Saturday afternoon and encountered a massive crowd of tourists in the big courtyard behind the Gwanghwamun Gate. These visitors likely lingered after watching the colorful changing of the guard ceremony, which takes place Wednesday through Monday at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Though we missed that afternoon’s performance, we had watched it here on one of our previous visits to Seoul. I consider these palace ceremonies, which are free for the public to watch, to be one of the great values for tourists in the city.Many of the people we saw here had rented traditional Korean attire from a courtyard shop to wear into the vast royal complex beyond, which requires an admission fee. On the palace grounds, they posed for selfies and for others, who wanted to capture them in front of the various well-maintained buildings, such as the throne hall or the crown prince quarters. These separate structures throughout the grounds give good insight into the living conditions for royalty during the Joseon Dynasty.Gyeongbokgung Palace, in use from 1395-1592, burned during the Japanese invasion and was not rebuilt until 1865. We found the well-shaded grounds to be immaculate and a pleasurable place to stroll. Water features include a lovely ornamental pond. This is the largest palace from the Joseon Dynasty that still exists and would be my recommendation for the one palace to see for those with time constraints.Located in Seoul’s Northern area, the palace can be reached by subway, line 3 to Gyeongbokgung stop, exit 5.,", November 2018

Oriental magpies and Brown-eared bulbuls make the palace come alive, not to mention the autumn foliage blazing in the background. You're going to have a great experience of the attraction where there are less people, in my opinion.", October 2019
172,4.0,Cultural History ,"Went here as our first sightseeing excursion Seoul. Great cultural experience as they were performing a reenactment of a ceremony. The grounds are huge and you could easily spend a half day exploring the property.  They give free tours in several different languages at different times, which is well worth it. Our guide was knowledgeable and super friendly, and eager to answer any questions our group had. The palace is easily accessible from the subway with a short walk from the nearest station.", October 2019
173,5.0,Palace tour ,"Arrive on the hour so you can see the changing of the guard.  Arrival it looked relatively small, but it’s deceptive and gradually reveals other buildings and depth to the complex.  A great few hours to learn more about the history of Seoul/Korea.  This amazing complex is surrounded by the modern city.", October 2019
174,4.0,"If you have time for only one palace, this is it","Still my favorite palace to visit Seoul after having done Changdeokgung, changyeunggung & deoksokgung.Dont forget to also watch the guard-changing ceremony, Royal palace museum & national folk museum (including the outdoor exhibits), which are ""outside"" the palace perimeter but just outside the gates. And free to visit.", October 2019
175,4.0,Very Interesting,"While this palace complex is similar in layout to the Forbidden City in Beijing, it is much smaller and less grand. If you visit on the hour you can see the changing of the guard ceremony. The costumes reflect the period when this was the Korean capital. This ceremony was worth the visit alone.", October 2019
176,5.0,Great visit,This is the largest of the five palaces located in Seoul. It is closed on Tuesdays. It has changes of the guard that is a very colorful and ceremonial event., October 2019
177,5.0,"Beauty, history and lots of Instagram opportunities","It’s really easy to find the Palace, there are signs from the subway station all the way to the place. We went during Chuseok, a national holiday, so entry was free. It’s a really huge palace with plenty to see. Make sure to bring your selfie stick or camera, there are so many gorgeous views, buildings and gardens so you’ll definitely get some fantastic pictures. It’s also beautiful to see people dressed in traditional Korean hanbok. As mentioned, we were there on a holiday but I think you can usually rent a hanbok for some photos.It started to rain a little bit the day we went, but it was still really pretty.", September 2019
178,5.0,Huge! Packed with history! ,"The tour of the Palace took us 4 hours! Unless you're running through it, you cannot do it faster (OK maybe 3-3,5h is possible too). We went there for the 11 o'clock gate guard change (a shorter ceremony) and finished it with the 2 p.m. General guard change ceremony. Both are for free and can be enjoyed even if you don't go to see the Palace. The entrance fee is ridiculously low, so you will definitely get more than you're paying for. We also got the audio guide as it provides detailed information about different buildings and the history. It's available in English, Korean and Chinese. It's not a must as you can read the signs to get some information but we felt like having an audio guide is easier as you can listen it while exploring. What we absolutely loved and recommend is the hidden café- Saenggwabang, the Dessert Department! It's located in the Palace kitchen buildings, so you need to look for it as otherwise you will probably not just stumble on it. We went there around joon, which is the perfect timing as later most of cakes were already sold out. You can purchase the traditional cakes as well as herbal tea and enjoy it in their lovely little café, on the floor. We absolutely loved the experience! I believe we paid like 9000won,which is ~7€, for a pot of tea and 4 cakes. We really wanted to buy some to go but that's unfortunately not possible, which is actually understandable as they want to keep it a unique experience.", October 2019
179,4.0,History check,Palace that has interesting history. Most of the original palace buildings have been destroyed. Few have been preserved and some rebuilt. Guard changing ceremony is the interesting part and the guards try to stay still but you could see their eyes wandering and enjoy the giggles from visiting tourists, October 2019
180,5.0,Cool place,The place where you can view the traditional palace and pavilion including its beatiful park and background of mountain., October 2019
181,5.0,A peaceful gem,"Really enjoyed our time here, especially the palace garden where the glass house is (not the Secret Garden, we didn't have time for that one). It is so peaceful and interesting, and not full of crowds. Take a picnic with you and make the most of the lovely gardens and quietudr. If you are seniors, do take ID as entry is free for over 65.", October 2019
182,5.0,Best palace ever,"Amazing palaceIt's very old palace and amazing pleaseYou can see every thing from pastYou can spend more 4 , 5 hours", October 2019
183,5.0,Best palace in Seoul,"I would say this is the largest and most grand palace in Seoul. The grounds are enormous with much to see. We went in the morning to see the changing of the guards, which my kids found fascinating. They even had a roped off section for children to sit so they could see better. If you could only see one palace this is the one.", October 2019
184,4.0,Worth the Visit,"This is a huge complex, made up of several sections. If you are going to visit don't make any other plans for the morning. Get there early, before the tour groups and school classes on field trips. The folk museum in particular gets over run by crowds after 11:00. The architecture is beautiful and the location in the heart of the city makes it easy to access. A definite must see in Seoul. The sites are mostly exterior; meaning, you do not go into most of the buildings, but it is still worth the visit.", September 2019
185,5.0,If you have to pick just one palace in Seoul to visit - this is the one,"Of all five palaces available for visiting in Seoul, this one is the largest and grandest, the one in my opinion most worth visiting. Be prepared for a LOT of walking, a lot of steps as the palace occupies quite a bit of ground and there are steps required to go up and down peering into all the different palace buildings.Get the audioguide - it is well worth it. The quality of the guide itself is superb in terms of the technical design; the English voiceover is also excellent.Notes:- If you do get tired, I would say the outer reaches of the palace are ones that you can probably miss. E.g., the section where they held the deceased king/queen, the pagoda (which you can't climb up to)- Entry to the pagoda section is strange, or the signage was unclear. The ticket booth there is not for you to purchase entry to see the pagoda; apparently that's a separate entry point into the palace grounds instead. You can walk straight out and get back in, if you are coming from the palace grounds already", October 2019
186,3.0,Historical interest,"The entire complex is vast. Definitely worth a visit. If you have interest for the history then we highly recommend a tour. Because of the scale of the site it’s easy to miss some interesting parts. They did not provide a map where you purchase the entrance tickets, it would be useful, we asked and the shoed us along. It’s a popular attraction especially on Sunday. 3000 Korean won per person. Allocate at least one hour for this attraction. The washrooms are large and very clean.", October 2019
187,5.0,Beautiful!,One of the most beautiful parts of Seoul. Among the restored buildings you can see what life was like in the old days. I recommend you go early because after 12 noon there are plenty of photo tourists., September 2019
188,5.0,Beautiful Palace,"We did what many tourists did, which is to rent the hanbok or traditional Korean costume for a few hours and walk around the palace. Note that if you are dressed in hanbok, you can enter the palace for free although it will still cost you more to rent the hanbok than the entrance fee.The palace is large and it took us at least a couple of hours to walk around, taking photos and watching the change of guard ceremony. Note that the change of guard ceremony takes place once in the morning and another time to in the afternoon. Try to catch it if you can as it is quite elaborate and there is an English explanation of the ceremony over the PA system.", October 2019
189,4.0,Huge and interesting place,"Tool subway and easy to get there. Entrance fee is cheap and full of tourists. Many ppl wear traditional Korea clothing entering the palace. Ticketing queue at the main entrance is always long in the morning. From the staff, there are 2 more ticketing entrance which has far less ppl at the side and back. The palace is huge and you could spend more than half day walking and taking photos. It is worth visiting for first time.", October 2019
190,5.0,Go there if you only have the time to visit one place in Seoul,"It is no comparison with palaces in Europe, India and China but it still offers many good scenes to take photo.  It is easy to go.  the change of guards ceremony is as attractive as many other places.   You can spend a couple of hours there exploring leisurely and take good photo.  If you have more time, spend 30 minutes to enjoy the tea ritual.  One amazing thing is that many people wear hanbok around producing a special ambience.  The president resident is nearby and the ancient Hanok Village are nearby.  Hanok Village is also worth going and there are many good local restaurants around.", October 2019
191,5.0,A very nice and typical Korean setting,You will enjoy beautiful Korean-style buildings with their so specific wavering roofs with the mountains in the background.

Beautiful photo ops. Many choices for Hanbok rental to make some amazing photo memories.  (Renting a hanbok gets your free entrance- no need to wait for the ticket booth!), October 2019
196,5.0,Unique experience,We strolled for hours in the vast palace compound and enjoyed every bit of it.It's beautiful and maintained in good condition.We would recommend to come in the morning so you can enter also the museum (closes at around 17:00~18:00)., October 2019
197,5.0,Marvellous Korean tradition,"Built in 1395 Gyeongbokgung Palace was abandoned and rebuilt in the 19th century and again destroyed by Japan in 1911.Two pavilions and the throne room survived. It is famous for the changing of the royal guard  twice a day in front of Gwanghwamun, the main gate of Gyeongbokgung at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. (except on Tuesdays). It is very colourful and special.While you are waiting try the Dunkin Donuts opposite!t", August 2019
198,5.0,Excellent palace,We ended up renting hanbok (Korean old-style fancy clothing) before going into the palace which meant that we got free entry. The palace grounds are stunning with lots of good places for taking photos especially if you are wearing hanbok. There is a beautiful pond on the right side of the grounds if you enter through the main gate. You can also see a large mountain looming over the palace grounds. Unfortunately we couldn’t see the whole grounds because we had to leave after two hours to return the hanboks. There is also the Korean folk museum and modern art museum nearby though we didn’t have a chance to go. You can’t walk into the buildings but other than that the palace is definitely worth going to., October 2019
199,5.0,Changing of the guard: A cultural tradition not to be missed!,"The changing of the royal guard takes you back in history to a tradition from the Joseon Dynasty, being a must for all fans of Korean culture.It is held at 10:00 and 14:00 (except Tuesdays) and lasts less than 30 minutes. We arrived at the earliest one and the weather was ok (not too hot for early September).Since a large crowd gathers, I would recommend arriving at least 15 to 20 minutes prior to the event.The best way to stand is with your back to the National Palace museum of Korea as guards enter from 2 different entrances; facing this way prevents missing part of the action (as some of the people did).", September 2019

204,4.0,Very interesting and worthwile for a visit,"I've been coming to Seoul for business for many years now but rarely have had a free day so today I decided to walk from my hotel up to the palace and it was well worth it!  The palace grounds are immense and most have been restored to their original splendor.  The entrance fee is very cheap (3000 won) and free if you are wearing traditional Korean dress (as I saw many people doing).I decided to rent the audio guide (which was also 3000 won) and that helped a lot to help me learn about what I was seeing.  Having been to major palaces and historical sites in other Asian countries, I felt kind of bad that I had not taken the time to learn more about Korean history but I am very glad that I went.  Highly recommended!", October 2019
205,5.0,Winter beauty,Surprising and a magnificent view at the lake in the winter. I usually come to this palace in the spring and fall time. But this time I had some friends visiting from overseas so I embraced the cold to show them the palace. Not a hint of disappointment. Pretty cold to wear Hanbok but the picture well worth it., February 2019
206,4.0,Explore Seoul ,"Very large grounds to explore.  80% of the visitors wear (rent) traditional korean dress.On the plus side, it's good photo opportunities and there is a lot to see.

212,4.0,Visit to the palace,"We hired traditional hanbok dress so we’re allowed in to the palace for free. The grounds are huge and the decoration is amazing. The one thing to note is that whenever you go, there is very little shade so if it’s a hot day, make sure you have water. There is a small shop in the grounds, but as a result is very busy. Overall the palace and its surroundings are really interesting and worth a visit.", September 2019

233,4.0,A must see in Seoul,"Take metroline 3 (orange) and get out at Gyeongbokgung station. This is a must see/do when in Seoul. It´s one of the most well maintained historical sites I have ever visited. Like many ´main tourist attractions´ it´s full of tourists, but because many locals like to rent traditional clothing and walk around all dressed up it gives you a very authentic feeling (until you all see people taking selfies and you are reminded they are from 2019 and not from the past). For me it was a great way to get to know Seoul/ South Korea on my first day. I went on my own for a quick visit, but if you have a chance to do a guided tour and learn about it´s history I think that would be very interesting. The place itself is huge and you can easily hang around for two hours. Later I found out there was a huge chunk of the park I missed (the water part) because I crossed over to the National folk museum, which is also well worth a visit by the way. If you have more time and feel like walking a bit more, you can also visit the Bukchon Hanok village at about 500 meters distance.", September 2019

Everything you see is historic.To start, we took the #3 train and got off at the Jongno station, exit 1 takes you straight to the palace and museum. We got there right when the changing of the guards had finished so be there by 10 am or 2 pm if you want to see it. But we were able to go on the 11 am guided tour in English, it is free and it is the only way to know what you are seeing because most buildings look the same.  The tour takes an hour and then you can walk around by yourself.

Entry is a reasonable 3000 for adults, 1,500 for juniors and free for under 6y or over 65y.  Changing of the guard takes place at 1000 and 1400 inside the Gwanghwamun gate and Gate Guard duty performance outside the gate is at 1100 and 1300 daily.

244,5.0,Hanbok dress earns free entrance,A wonderful slice of history brought to life. Probably most easily navigated for tourists as part of a city tour. Note that there's free entrance to the palace for people in tradition Hanbok dress., September 2019
245,5.0,Elegant and spacious,This palace is a must-see if you are in Seoul for the first time. We visited on a national cultural day so many visitors had rented traditional clothing which made the visit even more colorful and entry was free this day. This palace is immense with many internal sections so plan on spending a few hours walking around the grounds. It is possible to rent headphones with a device where you point to a spot on the map and it gives you a detailed history (available in multiple languages). We witnessed the changing of the guard (at 10 am) which was a colorful event. The gardens and ponds in the back are serene and beautiful. There is also a museum full of national treasures from the Joseon Dynasty. Definitely worth a visit!, September 2019
246,5.0,Must see,"If you're coming to Seoul, this place is a must see. The grounds are huge so be prepared to do a lot of walking. The view of the mountains is very majestic.

248,4.0,Most Impressive Of The Three Castles Visited,This castle was completed in 1395 shortly after the founding of the Joseon Dynasty.  It was destroyed during the Japanese invasion of 1592 and was reconstructed in 1867.During the Japanese Occupation between 1910 and 1945 most of the buildings were torn down and work continues to fully restore the place since 1990. It is large and impressive  and provides an interesting perspective of Korean history. It can get crowded but the grounds are extensive so it is not an issue.Access is via the Orange Line at  Anguk or Gyeongokgung Stations., September 2019
249,5.0,Bring your canera,"After a while the palaces start to look alike, but they each are beautiful in their own way. Best viewed in the winter or after a storm because the skies are usually cleared of smog and yellow dust. Take your time while walking around, take ur all in.", July 2019
250,3.0,The most touristic thing to do,"If you are just looking to do what everyone ‘should do’ coming to Seoul, go there, rent a ‘traditional’ costume and take lots of selfies for your instagram posts.Otherwise stay away. Most of what you will see is less then 20 years old and there are so many dressed up tourists, it feels like carnival. There are much better places to get an impression of historical palaces.On the other hand, the two musea on site are worth it. One is focused on daily lives of Korean people through time and the other one boast a solid collection of the interiors of the palaces.", September 2019
251,4.0,A nice photo stop,We came here on a cloudy day and didn’t choose to go deep into the palace compounds by paying an entrance fee. Tourists were soaking in the atmosphere with their rented hanboks., September 2019
252,4.0,History ,"Great place to visit if you are in Seoul, gives you a good feel of life back in the emperors time. Only knock is there are no real signs or plaques explaining what your looking at, but for the couple of dollars changed to get in, it was well worth it.", September 2019

255,5.0,It takes you back in Time,The interesting thing about the visit was we had to dress the traditional hanbok or Chosŏn-ot and visit the palace. We were lucky to arrive during the changing of the guards at 4 p.m. The changing of the guards are done twice a day in the mornings and evenings., September 2019
256,5.0,Details & Tips on visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace!,"Very beautiful palace that is super huge with lots to explore! Very photogenic palace. My friend and I got our hanbok rental + photography services on Klook Travel. It was a great experience and we went home with a lot of lovely shots to remember the day. Do check out the weather forecast before going! It happened to be drizzling when we went, which made the hanbok skirts wet and difficult to walk in, but the air was really nice and cooling! I personally think I enjoyed it better with the drizzles than if it was a really hot sunny day. Just avoid pouring rain and bring an umbrella in case. Here's a lil more about the place :> Largest & most beautiful of the 5 Grand Palaces> Built in 1395> represented the sovereignty of Joseon DynastyEntrance Fee is 3k wonFREE for seniors over 65yo, visitors in hanbok (you can rent nearby) and on Culture Day (last Wed of the month)> Free guided tours in 4 languages between 10am - 4pm> 2 types of Guard changing ceremonies between 10am - 2pm (Changing of palace guard ceremony inside Gwanghwamun gate & Gate Guard duty performance outside Gwanghwamun gate)> FOOD TIP : There is a Tosokchon Samgyetang nearby which is very well known for their Korean Ginseng Chicken.

258,5.0,A place to immerse yourself with Korean history.,This is a fabulous place for anyone and everyone to explore Korea history. From the palace walls to the museum inside you definitely get a sense of what the old days were like and beauty that Korea has Architect  wise. The price to enter is such a small amount $3 USD or free if you rent a hanbok- which I highly recommended for memorable pictures., August 2019
259,5.0,“The palace greatly blessed by Heaven” ⛩,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is an amazing experience and worth the visit when in Seoul!  Step back into time more than 600 years to walk these grounds and take in all the history that makes this palace a “MUST VISIT”.!  The grounds are vast with countless buildings, gates and walls to wonder around and take in all the aspects of Korean history and culture! Make sure you give yourself at least a couple hours for this one; it is spread out with lots to take in. Highly recommend.!!", September 2019

261,5.0,Birthday trip,"Wow. Visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace was the highlight on this one day tour. We felt as if we were transported back in time, by just walking through the Palace gate. It felt surreal for me. Seeing the size of the property and the designs certainly added to the mystique of the surroundings. The changing of the guards reminds me of British Palace tours, only more colorful and artsy. Added to the attraction were the visitors of all ages wearing rented traditional garbs. Amazingly awesome place to visit. We spent an hour here including visit to the National Folk museum situated on the same grounds. A must see when you go.", September 2019
262,5.0,Must See In Seoul,"We went in the morning with an organized tour group and we loved it. Admittedly, it always helps to have good weather and a clear, blue sky but the Palace grounds are very large and beautiful with plenty of different things to see. We also attended the Changing of the Guard ceremony which I would really recommend. I'd also recommend going with a tour guide because otherwise you'll be walking through the grounds not knowing what you see and you could get lost in this ""labyrinth"" and hence maybe miss some important buildings and stories. From the limited things I've seen in Seoul (it was a joint business/family 2-day trip), this was the highlight.", April 2019
263,4.0,A Must visit in Seoul,"Very good morning touring around the Palace and surrounding buildings. Extensive grounds to walk around with many buildings.

So everything you see today is very recent.", August 2019
265,4.0,Close to center of city,"It was built prior to Forbidden City of China, but a bit smaller and maybe a bit simpler?Overall, enjoyed the changes of guard, even though they were all actors. As the biggest of the 5 palaces in Seoul, it is still a must to do list, but may not need to visit the other palaces after this one.", September 2019
266,5.0,Beautiful,"Free English and Korean tours available,  usually 1.5 hour long. Three times a day,  last is at 330pm or so. This was on a Sunday for us.   I recommend the tour guides bc it makes seeing the building and at different aspects more enjoyable and knowing their history is a plus.Admission is 3000 won/ adult.  Credit card accepted.  You can rent traditional clothing and get free admission,  rental rates is cheaper as you get further from the palace.  Usually 10000 won nearby the palace.

272,4.0,A day from the past,"It was an interesting place. The palace is a large area with different buildings and gardens. By the entrance gate it was very crowded but the more you walk inside, the less people there is. Alot of people are dressed in the traditional clothes, so it was very interesting. It felt like a movie set or a scene from the past. The buildings were simple with colored wood decorations.", September 2019
273,5.0,Got Great Pics of Costumed Visitors,"I went by myself via the subway, which was very safe and interesting. The palace a short walk from the stop. I timed my arrival with the changing of the guard. I spent 2-3 hours here, wandering about and taking photos. The numerous costumed guests afforded me great shots as they posed, ran, or peaked out. The entry fee was reasonable. I'm happy tourists are allowed to view the grounds.Afterwards, I walked around the area and saw a huge protest at Gwanghwamun Square, which is a gathering place in front of the palace. I was told there something going on there almost daily. A further bit down the road and I ran into a Starbucks and then on to the tourist information center, where they were very helpful. I need an SD card for my phone and they called the nearby bookstore and inquired if they did indeed sell the cards as I had been told. I then walked across the street, to the bookstore, and discovered that it is nothing like I would know in the USA. They sell all manner of things inside that store. It was very interesting there too. This area is a must-see!", September 2019
274,5.0,Seoul day tour,"Amazing place to visit. We did this as part eof our Seoul full day tour, so our guide explained alot. We arrived right as the changing of the guard ceremony was beginning. Plenty to see and learn.", September 2019
275,4.0,Just Ike K-Drama,Interesting visit to the palace. Lots of other tourists in rented Hanboks to make the place more fun to visit. It would have been better with more signage to share more about the different areas of the palace and its history. Else it’s a nice stroll that takes about 2-3 hours. Nice shopping and food surrounding the palace too., September 2019

If you come in traditional costume, the entrance fee is waived, but it was summer, so our hosts opted for the cooler choice of paying for the tickets.  We were thankful!! Plenty of photo opps, beautiful grounds and buildings, fascinating history.", August 2019
278,5.0,Beautiful place of History must visit,If you are visiting seoul this is one of the places that it must be in your list to visit.Recommend to rent a hanok to wear which is the triditional korean custom and if you dress it you get a free entrace to the palace.The entrace for an adult cost 3000 KRW.Hanok custom rental for 2 hrs cost around 14000- 18000 KRW.

The trip can be completed by a visit to the nearby village. I recommend it for anyone interested to immerse himself in the past era of Korea., August 2019
282,5.0,Half a day MINIMUM,"One of the biggest palaces in terms of walking and things to see. Bit of a health and safety hazard, so watch young children as falls are signposted but there are few barriers. Pro of this, is better pictures without black and yellow health and safety tape on all edges. It's a little maze, and there's many complexes to see. Grab a free map from the entrance and tick off places as you visit, Look out for Korean's wearing traditional clothes and having photo shoots in the grounds. Easily could spend a full day here.Get it as part of the Royal Palace pass to get a discount - pass is valid for 3 months from purchase date.", September 2019
283,4.0,Big palace compound ,"This is a huge palace compound. A clear fine product of the Korean Dynasty. There are a few gates and halls with distinctive architects for perfect photo. Even so when one dress in the traditional Hanbok. While the inner compound is stone paved and very bare, there is an outer area of greenery. This is the part we enjoyed most. Old trees, green grass, big pond with the willow trees  which contrasted the inner court. Really enjoy the stroll and relax atmosphere. Another perfect spots for photos.", September 2019

286,5.0,Thunder and Tragedy,"Into every lengthy vacation this side of the Gobi, some rain must fall.  My luck finally ran out on my last day in Seoul, with a thunderstorm intense enough to put Noah’s 40 days to shame.  Nevertheless, I was determined to see one specific ghost-ridden spot within Gyeongbokgung, of world-wide historical importance, rain or no.  Pelting rain at the vast complex in August does keep you cool.  Distant rain-shrouded mountains turn grey and misty, like an ink painting come to life (see Heungnyemun and Geunjeongleon photos).  Gyeonghoeru Pavilion’s roof blends with its rain-swept lake, and its red eaves and balconies take on an (appropriately for me) sombre tone (see Gyeonghoeru Pavilion and  Gyeonghoeru Eaves photos).   And the colourful interiors of the Geunjeongleon Throne Room and Sajeongjeon’s Hall of Worthies are bright by comparison (see Throne Hall and Hall of Worthies photos).  At Gyeongbokgung, these are a thunderstorm’s sole virtues.I worried that the rain would scare away all the Hanbok Belles, one of the aesthetic joys of visiting any Korean palace. But the downpour didn’t deter the Belles from strutting their stuff in the national dress.  Their attitude seemed to be “Rain, fiddlesticks!  We’ve never met the rainstorm yet that could whip our hoop skirts!” (See Hanbok 1, Hanbok 2 and Hanbok 3 photos).And tears from Heaven were appropriate given my reason for being there.  I was headed to the back of Gyeongbokgung, as far from the entrance and the crowds as you can go, to see Geoncheonggung Palace.  A barbaric event occurred there: the sadistic butchering of Queen Min: usually called an “assassination” though that word doesn’t begin to capture the horror of the actual event.  That crime on October 8th, 1895  started a half-century reign of terror, with consequences still hanging over us.Following the Meiji Restoration, Japanese nationalism generated militarism and a policy of foreign expansion.  Expansion generally means war, but does not necessarily mean systematic and sadistic barbarity.  For all World War I’s horrors, the French, British and Germans on the Western Front neither tortured prisoners of war nor systematically gang-raped their enemies’ young women.  For years the Austro-Hungarian and Italian armies on the Isonzo Front scrupulously abided by the Hague Conventions.  Even the first chess-move in Japan’s drive to expand, against China in 1894, was a relatively gentlemanly naval affair, though one-sided.  Japan got Formosa, but the Western powers blocked them from getting the mainland Chinese territory they’d demanded.  So Japan turned back to another target they’d long been eyeing: Korea.  Korea’s timorous emperor could easily be coerced.  Japan’s problem was that Empress  Myeongseong, “Queen Min”, could not be.  To counter Japanese instructors of Korean militia, Queen Min brought in military instructors from the USA.  Queen Min strengthened relations with Tsarist Russia, Korea’s northern neighbour, as a counter to Japan.  Queen Min even got the Chinese Customs Service extended into Korea.  That internationally-run service honestly collected customs revenues and delivered those revenues to Peking, and now to Seoul as well, thus strengthening foreign relations, and funding military improvements.  Tokyo had been within an ace of making Korea a Japanese puppet.  Now Korea was fast slipping out of their fingers, all due to Queen Min, particularly when she ordered the disbanding of that Japanese-trained militia.   Viscount Miura, one of Japan’s most senior statesmen, was dispatched to Korea to remedy this.  Miura decided to make Korea’s emperor “an offer he couldn’t refuse.”      In the middle of the night, on October 8th, 1895, Japan staged a military-style assault on the Geoncheonggung Palace.  The attackers included some pro-Japan Korean traitors, but the hard core of the assault were 60 or so Japanese.  The palace guards were overwhelmed and massacred.  Miura’s Japanese agents caught up with Queen Min and her maids of honour as they were trying to escape through a patio.  First Queen Min was repeatedly raped; then she was hacked with swords, and finally she was burned along with her maids of honour, possibly while some of them were still alive.  The king fled in terror to the Russian legation, where he was given sanctuary.  It was obvious that Miura had ordered the barbarism, and the whole world was outraged, including Japan’s powerful ally, Great Britain.  Due to that, the Japanese government was compelled to put Miura on trial for the crime.  Perhaps if they’d hung him, the hard-line faction in Tokyo would have been cowed.   We’ll never know, because the trial was as outrageous as the crime. Miura freely admitted that he had ordered the crime.  His defence attorney argued that Miura should be acquitted on the grounds that no act done in the national interest of Japan, no matter how grisly, could ever be criminal.   The Japanese court then found Miura innocent on grounds of insufficient evidence!  Miura was hailed and honoured as a national hero.  What more encouragement could Japan’s most ruthless factions have gotten?  The Japanese are NOT a nation of sadistic thugs; just as Germans, Spaniards and Turks aren’t, despite Auschwitz, the Inquisition, and the Armenian massacres.  But in all these countries, for a while, the worst elements were in control. During the half-century after Queen Min’s assassination, there was always an opposition to the direction that Japan was headed.  What Queen Min’s assassination and Miura’s acquittal did, was to terrifically boost the power and arrogance of the extremists. Over those next 50 years, even respected senior Japanese statesmen would be assassinated with impunity by them.  A dark path was taken; it started here.  It led to the the 300,000 victims of the Rape of Nanking, to the slaughter at Singapore’s Alexandria Hospital, the Bataan Death March, the horrors committed in Intramuros, the victims—perhaps hundreds of thousands of them—of Unit 731’s biological warfare testing; and the hundreds of thousands of sex slaves whose lives were destroyed: 80% of these “comfort women” were Korean.  Jaoan’s path led to a 50-year road, then highway, then super-highway of ever-increasing horror, which was only stopped by the counter-horror of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Over the 50 years that Japan ruled Korea, the Japanese diligently demolished places that might evoke Korean nationalism.  Most of Gyeongbokgung Palace wound up being knocked down, and needless to say, Queen Min’s palace was one of the first to go.  Korea has worked slowly and steadily at rebuilding exact replicas of the heritage that its enemies demolished, including  Geoncheonggung Palace.  If you go there, I was assured that what you see is identical with what stood there on that night.  And you really are standing on hallowed ground.You can go to lots of other assassination sites: Ghandi Smriti, the Church of the Savior on Blood, Dealey Plaza, even the spot in the Theatre of Pompey where Julius Caesar was done in by Brutus. But if I am correct that the assassination of Queen Min lit a fuse igniting 50 years of horrors in Asia, and leading ultimately to the Damocles sword of intercontinental nuclear war that now hangs over all of us, then I can think of only one other assassination spot on Earth that matches this one for historic significance: the memorial plaque just off the Latin Bridge in Sarajevo, where Franz Ferdinand and Sophie were killed.", August 2019

As most of Korea was devastated by war, we were thrilled that this complex has been recreated.
