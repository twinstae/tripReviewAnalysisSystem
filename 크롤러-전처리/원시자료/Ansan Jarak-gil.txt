0,5.0,Weekly trail hike,"I love being out there especially in the crips morning, maybe mostly to avoid a lot of other people.   It is also quite interesting to walk on elevated wooden roadways.   The signs say it will take between 2-3 hours you can easily do it under 2 hours I believe. ", October 2019
1,3.0,Short but steep,"Shorter than many other trails in Seoul mountains, Ansan is beautiful but steep, especially the northern end.", April 2019
2,5.0,A bit tough to reach the trail start,, September 2019
3,5.0,My weekly outdoor exercise,The Jarak-gil trail of Ansan is a very well developed fairly easy trail to hike. It is crowded on the weekends but less so than some other mountains such as Bukhansan (also worth hiking but on a less crowded weekday). I recommend going off the trail to really explore the mountain places such as Beacon hill and the water wheel the first time you hike Ansan. When the sky is clear you can get some awesome views of the different parts of Seoul. It is also worth exploring Bongwonsa Temple and Independence Park at the base of the mountain., June 2019
4,5.0,Climb to the top!,"I went to this mountain with my husband on a Sunday morning with the plan to have a relaxing walk along the Ansan Jarak-gil. This wooden path is a loop around the mountain, designed for strollers and wheelchairs. But once there we decided to go up to the Fire Beacon on the top of the mountain. The climb to the top was a bit challenging at some places but the views along the way and from the top were definitely worth the climb!", May 2019
5,5.0,Great nature park. Wide range of terrain for a smallish park,, May 2019
6,5.0,Hidden nature treat! ,, September 2018
7,4.0,Hiking trail suitable for all,"Ansan Jarak-gil is a 7 kms circular walking trail located in Seodaemun-gu, the path was designed and created in 2013 suitable for strollers, wheelchairs, senior citizens, pregnant women and children.  The path takes you on a gentle slope, through forest and with good views of the city of Seoul.  We noticed an information board and map about the trail in Seodaemun Independence Park, the closest subway station is Dongnimmum (exit #5).", April 2018
