0,5.0,Must see for any-one interested in Tae Kwon Do and its history.,I have visited 2 times in 3 years and had the good fortune to meet some of the great staff that represent TKD in Korea and in the development of the sport.

4,5.0,Excellent performance,"One of the best Taekwondo demonstration I have seen, the plank breaking was really impressive. Show duration is about one hour and the performance hall is about 10 minutes walk from Gangnam station, exit 12.", October 2017
5,4.0,Loved their TKD demonstrations show,"I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed Kukkiwon's Taekwando demonstration show. It told a story, and combined TKD moves into a narrative with a big screen in the background. I had expected to just see people do some routines. This was much more interesting. The artists did a great job too, with many difficult moves. I deducted a star because, as an english-only speaker, it was hard to get tickets. I had to contact AskAjumma to get tickets for me. And the time of the show was not advertised anywhere that I could find. But once I had the tickets, there was a nice gentlemen at the arena who helped us get seated. After the show they invited people who wanted to break a board to come onto the stage. The emcee spoke English and Korean so my kids were able to join in and broke their first board! Very cool.", June 2017
6,4.0,See their demo show!!!,"It is a great organization but for a tourist not much of a site to visit unless you go to their demo show ""Great Tae Kwon Do"". It combines legend, a ton of board breaking and action. It was a blast! At the end you can break a board with the cast. Their website sucks so get someone Korean speaking to figure out times.", July 2017
7,5.0,A wonderful way to experience the traditional Korean Taekwando,A wonderful institute established by Kukkiwon to promote globally the Korean tradition of Taekwando. They have a museum and cafetaria for visitors to explore. They also regularly organize international competition and demonstrations of Taekwando. It was an amazing experience participating in the September 2016 festival. I got to see the talented competitors of all age groups from different nations participating. Several nations also presented tradition dances and had their food stalls during this festival., September 2016
