0,5.0,Lovely Grounds after a Nice Hike,"I decided to take the bus to get to this place on a very early Saturday morning.  Just a one bus transfer from Gangnam.  There is actually a shuttle service, however, I was not sure of the actual location of the pick-up points.  Its best to have a wifi cause google maps can lead", May 2019
1,5.0,Beautiful environment and a great variety of food,"We were invited as a group and had a great evening, topped with cultural experience while the food just kept coming to the table in at least 10 turns. We only had water and tea but this was just great not to take away any of the taste from the food.", July 2018
2,5.0,Excellent Dinner and location,"My Korean customer invited me there for a dinner meeting.It is a world ""out of busy city of Seoul"". Paceful place inside a truly traditional Korean old building with a cozy garden.We had a excellent food, I was extremely satisfied.Take the opportunity to enjoy it if you are in the city!", May 2018
3,3.0,Traditional Korean food,"The restaurant is located in premises used for government events. As our visit was during a wet and dark night, I can only imagine that the grounds are beautiful. There was a wedding and the place was very crowded. Perhaps the ambience is more suited to such occasions rather than just a meal.We did not have the set menu but several  Ã  la carte items. Food was nice but not memorable, from exotic abalone to common vegetable pancake. The room and decor were not particularly fancy. Only the buildings and gates were in old Korean style.", May 2018
4,4.0,Nice dinner,My friend treated me a really nice Korean dinner (Hanjeongsik) The food was awesome and we were so full. The servers were nice and helpful. I enjoyed my dinner at Samcheonggak. Need reservation., August 2017
5,4.0,Fine cuisine,"We booked for lunch through our hotel concierge and made use of the free shuttle service provided by the restaurant. Was at the pick-up point five minutes before the scheduled time and the van arrived promptly to bring us there.The drive up a meadering hill was scenic with tall trees & fresh air. When we arrived at the entrance to the restaurant, we were awed by the beautiful landscaped garden surrounding the ""palace"" restaurant.We dined at the main hall and the service staff were really tip-top. The prices are not cheap though but we order 2 set menus consisting of about 10 items which cost about Kwn69,000/- . Since we wanted to try a different kind of cuisine, we decided to pay for this extravagant lunch.The food was fine and quantity small but enough to fill you up at the end of the meal. The cooking style was not oily and most items looked braised or stewed.I will recommend this restaurant if you want to dine at a restaurant with a nice ambience and beautiful surroundings.", May 2017
6,4.0,How the Emperor use to eat? ,That's how it was pitched to us. I'm not so sure. The food is just ok. Tastes more healthy than delicious. Would come here more for the stroll around the surroundings before and after dinner..., May 2017
7,3.0,Nice place but needs refinement,"The location on a hill was superb. It creates an anticipation for things to come.We had lunch there and went for a set has most of the items we wanted to try. We were told that they will need 20 minutes to prepare the food. No worries.Trouble was when the food came, it was not course by course. Salad came with the second course and the third! Plates started to clutter the table as if went to a banchan shop. But Samcheonggak was not. And this went on through out the meal. It was as if they served the food after the kitchen has prepared it, not after you finished a course. It made eating harried and not a pleasant experience.Besides that, the salad dressing (1st) and the pine nut dressing (4th) was so similar in taste, they shouldn't be set so near to each other. Having the scallops & shrimp in pine nut dressing served before we even finished our salad compounded to the negatives.I was not sure if it was the high expectations that made this dining experience so memorable in a bad way.Was it a good meal? Borderline yes.Was it worth the price? Not really.Will we go again for lunch? Don't think so. Maybe for a coffee to take in the views.", December 2016
8,4.0,Unique dining experience,We brought our daughter to Korea for the first time and wanted to experience some of the traditional korean cuisine.  And this place was fantastic. We came here for lunch on a Sunday at noon. When we fist arrived we were the only people but the place filled full soon after.  The server started bring out the food right at noon and continuously for about an hour. The food had fresh ingredients and they were delicious.   My daughter did not care for pumpkin porridge but my husband and I loved it.   Other than all of us enjoyed everything.  The service was excellent and it was well worth it.  The only minor problem we had was finding a taxi to take us back to our hotel.  The restaurant was located on a remote hillside and there were not many cabs available. The restaurant tried to call a cab but we were told to wait for at least an half hour. Luckily we found a cab that dropped off other customers to ride back to hotel., September 2016
9,5.0,Tranquility amidst the din of the big city.,"We indulged in a Sucheong Sura (a.k.a. The King's Dinner). There were 13 courses; very much like a fantastic ""tasting menu"" of authentic Korean cuisine.  We were entertained by traditional Korean musicians and had a thoroughly wonderful experience.", June 2016
10,4.0,Charming venue; a slice of Korean history,We had a group event. The food was decent. Venue was fantastic. Entertainment was first rate. Great for large gatherings. So near Seoul but so high up and surrounded by greenery., May 2016
11,4.0,A quiet retreat,"If you want to experience a good quality Korean banquet meal in peace with a great view then this is a good place. The prices are a little high but the service is good and the variety and volume of food is very good. January is not the best time for being outdoors at minus 15 so the main activity was eating, followed by a quick walk around the premises. The view is good. There are tables that can see the view but we chose an interior table. Needless to say, you should like Korean food!", January 2016
12,5.0,"Absolutely charming, lovely place","A quaint, well-maintained restaurant/tea house with a great view. A bit expensive but worth it. The environment around is also so peaceful and beautiful it's lovely to just go out and take a long walk after a tea. I love going there every time I get a change to visit Korea.", September 2014
13,5.0,A must place,"Highly recommended place . A place to relax, to take photos, to have lunch...Serene atmosphere and romantic feel.", February 2015
14,4.0,great view,"There is a free shuttle to Samcheonggak, which we took from Gwanghwamun area at Gallery Hyundai stop. It's about 10 to 12 minutes bus ride to there.If you would like to dine at the restaurant for Korean course meal, do make a reservation. Since we didn't have any, our lunch was at the Dawon, the terrace where one could still enjoy the mountain view of Mount Bukak.The menu at Dawon is pretty limited to a few items only. Korean dishes and pastas. Friend tried the vegetarian bibimbap while I got the beef bulgogi. Prices was between 14000 to 16500 won.Only two staff to service the floor so, things could get pretty slow. Nevertheless, we took a stroll around the area after lunch, and it was nice stroll. Leaves were of a green, yellow and red, the colours of autumn.Though it was within walking distance to Samcheong-dong (about 20 mins), do take the free shuttle or taxi there as the road leading to Samcheong-dong are meant for cars and not pedestrians.", October 2014
15,5.0,a great place to go,one of the best restaurants in seoul. here you get a great service and special food from korea. its one  of the places that you have to go, October 2014
16,4.0,Nice place for lunch,A nice quiet place out from the hustle and bustle of Seoul City. They have a hourly shuttle bus that pick people up from a couple of places in Seoul. ( Eg. About 20m from JONGGAK station exit no.5) We took the 10.16am bus from here.  Lunch Set cost us about US$60 per head but it comes with good quality stuff ., October 2014
17,4.0,Oasis,Took free shuttle from Insadong to restaurant.An oasis sitting a hill overlooking Seoul.Pricey but worth it for the experiences.Trad pagodas around the Korean restaurant.Also there is this Cafe sitting on a porch overlooking Seoul  which we did not try.I saw free car parking there though I did not drive, July 2013
18,4.0,Good Place to experience Good Quality Korean Food,"This is a place with restaurants offering good food at premium price. Apparently, this place is patronized by mainly well-dressed people, so please wear something more presentable too, so that you will not feel out of place. We had a multiple course lunch at the Samcheonggak Restaurant for 2 persons (and yes, the lunch menu required for a minimum 2 persons). Please be informed that it is fine dining (read: some portions in nicely decorated style).You can experience the quietness of place, and several traditional buildings that are well maintained and nicely landscaped. After your lunch or tea break, you may take a short walk around the place to see it's building and garden. Not a very big place, so just a couple of hours here will do (including lunch). There is a shuttle bus that will bring you out to the nearest metro station.", October 2012
19,3.0,Good but way too pricey and not at all korean traditional food,"i lived in korea for 2 years, ate at a lot of traditional korean restaurant and tried lot of delicious and amazing korean dishes through those 2 years. However, samcheonggak wasn't one of those nice traditional restaurants.Food is good but nothing is amazing or spectacular. Moreover this is more like a korean european fusion were dishes are microscopic and look fancy to the eye. Which is not what korean cuisine is about. Korean cuisine is more earthy and simple, more traditional and meals should all come at the same time and not one by one like in a french restaurant course. The cadre around the restaurant is lovely and truely amazing in one of the most beautiful place of Seoul. The inside of the restaurant kind of modern fusion style is very average from what u can find in countries like japan in average restaurants.For the price i will pass.", July 2011
20,5.0,Delicious,"Got the free shuttle bus outside Kyobo bookstore in Gwanghwamun.The restaurant has nice a modern deco.The service was really good.We ordered ""Dongbaek Sura"" - cost around KRW 61,000 inc tax.They brought a menu to us - written ""A dining table prepared with sincerity for you someone special"" - how nice.There were 9 courses including dessert. I really love the pan cake, grilled scallops with wild sesame sauce and bulgogi with Pine mushroom.The bathroom was very clean :)We got the shuttle back to Gwanghwamun but it also goes to Insadong, Jongno and back to Kyobo bookstore.I will return if I visit Seoul again.", December 2010
