2,4.0,Fun for children,, March 2019
3,4.0,Family fun day,"Whilst at the beginning I thought it was a little pricey, the number of rides available to all and short wait time made it worthwhile. Only downside was the lack of English speaking guides within the park which made it a little difficult to get around. Other than that we had a great time", February 2020

Lotte World Tower contains everything that is necessary for modern urban living.", January 2020
6,4.0,Largest indoor theme park,"We travelled in winter, therefore chose Lotte over Everland and it didn't disappoint. As any theme park, there are many attraction, rides etc. It's connected to an outdoor amusement park called Magic Island and the theme park itself is connect to a shopping mall that features theaters, sports facilities etc. It's closer to the city and can be reached easily by public transport", December 2019

10,3.0,Lotte World,"Avoid going during public holidays, school holidays and weekends. The queues are so long. It takes 1 hour to queue for any ride. The plus side is that its cheap entry tickets.", December 2019
11,4.0,Internal and external amusement park,My 2 teens asked to visit an amusement park. Wanted to visit Everland but was quite a distance.  Decided to visit some place nearer to our hotel. Took a cab there and thought that the driver had sent us to the wrong place as we are not aware that the entrance is at the basement. Unlike Disneyland. Went in and there was a long queue to purchase the tickets. There were many students. Luckily the queue proceeded smoothly and fast. Bought the tickets to the park and folk museum. Did not go to the museum so we wasted on that. Spent about 3 hours as there weren‚Äôt many rides that appealed to my teens. We bought the so called fastpass in the park so my teens need not queue up. The place was alright but not as good as Disneyland. Need a bit of refurbishment though., December 2019
12,5.0,Amassing Amusement Park Indoor and Outdoor ü•∞ü•∞,A great place to spend time with your kids whom will love the adventure and thrilling of rides everywhere. It is similar to Disney Land & combination of Universal Studio but only Korean Style. Many amusement park indoor and outdoor were pack with teenagers and even children‚Äôs in all walks of age. Lovely to see explore and have fun to feel how it is it to be like kid again. üíïüíïüíï, December 2019

16,2.0,Big shopping with indoor entertainment ,"It‚Äôs a big shopping centre, with lots of entertainments like kids. There‚Äôs really not much shopping. Mostly games & food. It‚Äôs not a place for us.", December 2019
17,4.0,Biggest indoor amusement park,"The park is divided into outdoor and indoor. Outdoor features some of the most thrilling rides and coupled with a few kiddy rides. The castle is one of the prominent display outdoor that you will take picture with. Recommended to buy fast passes as most rides have very long waiting time. There are also plenty of Restaurants inside the park. For very young toddlers, they do have a designated indoor areas for them too.", December 2019
18,3.0,Theme park during winter @ Korea,"Had fun but park was not as good like we imagine. Kids section is fun for kids age from 2 to 7yrs old. My child got bored after awhile. Poor in general is old, makes me thing of the theme park in Genting Highland.", December 2019
19,2.0,Nothing really charming about this park,"So we decided to book a ticket to lotte world during our vacation to Seoul, but I was really disappointed about the park. Having been to Disneylands, I would say lotte world is not even close to being as good as Disneyland. I was hyped at first at the entrance, wondering about the fun rides the park is going to offer but eventually i was greeted with disappointment when i took a look at the park map. Basically, the only fun ride was the Atlantis roller coaster and nothing else is that good. Plus, the place was packed with local students and I had to queue for 3 hours just for the Atlantis ride and trust me it wasn't pleasant at all. By the time we completed the ride, it was already evening. I would say they're trying to emulate disneyland with the castle and stuffs but boy was i wrong, as it wasn't even a ""fun"" experience at all. Rides were below average, some places were not covered with the 1 day pass and of course the massive crowd. I don't blame the crowd, but rather how small the park is to accommodate the large crowd.", December 2019
20,3.0,Overhyped,"A much overhyped amusement park, I'd say with nothing spectacular really. Generally great for thrill-seeking teenagers, perhaps adults, and families with young kids. Food is expectedly priced higher than usual. I'd say it's good enough to have been there, done that. Doesn't entice us to return unless there's major revamp.", December 2019
21,3.0,Super long queue even for a weekday,Visited on Tue 17 December 2019. Waited 1.5 hour for French Revolution VR. They should remove VR when it is not VR. Should have gotten the magic pass for this. Luckily this roller coaster ride is quite fun with a 360 degree turn. Only family rides have shorter queues around 5 to 1p minutes., December 2019
22,3.0,Nothing special just another tall building,5th tallest building in the world. On a cloudy day not worth going to the top of the floor. Fortunately you are able to go to the 31st floor (but have to queue for the access card) where the food court is and the Signature 7/11 is located. Nothing more nothing less., December 2019
23,1.0,Waiting times are very long even on a Monday. Staff are unfriendly and cold ,Nice theme park but not at $50 USD. Rides have long waiting times and staff are super difficult to deal with. You are better off going to a local disneyland or other theme parks at that price., December 2019
24,4.0,Good Place for Children and teenager,"I visit Lotte World on Sunday and the weather is light rain, unfortunate for me. Because the most extreme ride is closed. The rest is just good", December 2019

26,2.0,Alot of the ride needs extra payment and too long waiting time,"This amusement park is much more indoor-centric , and quite alot of the rides need extra payment which are not included in the entrance fee. And the waiting time are really crazy even on a school day. The outdoor park is quite small as well. In short, if you want to come here , I highly recommend you to get the Fast pass or else you would end up wasting alot of your time waiting.", November 2019
27,4.0,head on out there!,"Lotte world is just that, it's own little world that part amusement park, part indoor ice skating rink, underground aquarium part shop till you drop underground, followed by restaurants galore from street food to fine dining. It's your one day to explore underground activities all in one place. In the spring, it's one of the best place to catch in Seoul to catch cherry blossoms around the lake. There's plenty to do for all ages that it will literally take you the whole day if you just take slow and steady.", November 2019
28,1.0,Don‚Äôt even waste your time,"Worst place ever, even with a map it‚Äôs confusing to go around . Trying to be a Amusement park but it‚Äôs a giant arcade", November 2019
29,3.0,Not worth the Hype,"We went on a Thursday, wait times for the 3 rides worth going on were 70-80 minutes. It is more aimed at younger children than teenagers/adults. Definitely not a must do, especially if you‚Äôve already been to a Disneyland before.", November 2019
30,4.0,MUST VISIT,, November 2019

33,4.0,Mid November Lotte World,Our kids enjoyed mainly the indoor theme activities rather than the outdoor as the weather is too cold and windy. Temperature was 1¬∞C. Suggest bringing own food for the muslims as there are no halal food in there. Kids enjoyed most of the activities. The indoor is huge. I suggest you guys starts from the top floor than down., November 2019

35,5.0,Amusement park ,"If using the train, go to the Jamsil Station. You can get to Lotte world without going outside, there is a connection underground. I have been to many amusement parks, and I would not say that this has the best rides but I would say that it was a really fun environment and a fun place for kids and for friends just walking around and going on rides. They do have some really awesome rides for adults, but I don't think the adults will be doing the hair and dress up to be a princess for the day. Especially when all the dresses are kids sizes. They have parades and showtimes which are great. Right now they still have the Halloween decorations up in the Halloween shows going on and I have to say they did an amazing job. The lines for the rides are pretty long on the weekends especially after 4 pm. Be aware that tickets have a discounted price after 4, which means a lot more people are there. So there is a pretty big crowd for the Halloween show in Magic Island. Make sure you hold your kids hands or you will lose them. After 4, it is also common for lines on rides to run an hour to 150 minutes for wait time. No exaggeration.", November 2019

40,4.0,Love Lotte World!!!,"This is my second time going here. I like both indoor and outdoor rides! However, I prefer outdoor since it's more daring for older people. Depends on when you come, the park would decorate itself into Halloween/Christmas theme. I went during Halloween, and it was great to see display of Halloween; and I saw zombies come out in the evening to frighten people! It was scary and funny! Also, you can rent some cute clothes/high school/uniforms to walk around and take pictures!! Overall, if you're a foreigner--make sure to google ticket discount and go see Lotte World!! There are also restaurants indoor where you can buy food. It's waiting for you!!!", September 2019

45,5.0,Fun afternoon for friends & kids,We took friends here who are visiting Korea for the first time.  It was also our first time.  We missed getting the magic passes that come with your regular park admission so will remember that for next time. We were also here for the big halloween party so crowds got heavier than I anticipated in the afternoon but we had a really nice time! My friend had trouble using her card- won is easiest. Lots of options for food and reasonable lines., October 2019

51,5.0,Lotte world at 50% discount for foreigner,"We went on 11/9/19 (chuseok: 12-14/9/19). There's usually a 50% discount for foreigners. Coupon usually avail on their website only few days before the holiday. initially we wanted to go on another day after 4pm (with the half-day ticket) but since there's a 50%, we went full day. We r glad that we made the right choice. We went in around 9+. There's little or no queue at all in the morning. We therefore do all the popular rides first. We were even able to do twice on some of the rides. Hours later the queue starts to build up but still we were able to queue within 15-30mins for most rides. We were there till 4pm and managed to complete all the rides that are suitable for our kids aged 5&8. When we exit around 4pm, we saw a long queue outside at the ticketing counter and was so glad that we didn't go for the after 4pm option.", September 2019
52,5.0,Best place for indoor games,This was the best place to play indoor games. There are also variety outdoor games. The price was affordable, October 2018
53,3.0,There is NO HALAL restaurant in Lotte World,The Pasha restaurant already CLOSE. Thus the only option that I notice is sulbing bingsu shop or bring some snacks from the lotte mart outside. We left early and not manage to finish exploring the entire park since we are so hungry. Most of the staff excluding the information counter personnel cannot speak and understand English which is very sad., September 2019
54,4.0,Good old Lotte world,, August 2019

56,4.0,Enjoyable day out ,, September 2019
57,5.0,As good as any theme park,"I didn‚Äôt do much research before coming here and expect a rather simple theme park. I am wrong. It has all a theme park to offer and more. From outdoor rides to indoor activities. It was a rainy day but we still able to catch some outdoor rides like the gyro drop, spin and comet express. The indoor part is also huge with so many rides and activities. Lots of food outlets. Never out of choices. A day is not enough. One tip is never buy ticket on site. Better to purchase through online site such as klook or Trazy as you can get almost half price. Also don‚Äôt forget to visit the museum. Worth a visit.", September 2019
58,4.0,Good for young youth,Very nice well designed place with lots of rides.  Its both indoor and outdoor.  It is very similar to Disney., July 2019
59,4.0,Short visit to Lotte World,"As i went with a tour guide, we only had a few hours there and shortage of time and it was really crowded so we did not ice skate or play with any of the rides. We just walked around, take photos..Quite boring if youre already there but unable to play..They have a mall for you to shop too but again, due to time constraint we were unable to walk around and shop. So if you plan to come here, please ensure youre not in a tour group and do not go during peak season as time will be wasted in queuing up for the rides as it will get really crowded", February 2019
60,4.0,Fun in the city,"Lotte world is a nice amusement park right in the city. There is a indoor section and an outdoor section so even on rainy days and in winter you can still go and have a good time. There are plenty of places to eat and drink in the park. The inside part has balloon shape cars that go around the ceiling and a wild indoor rollercoaster.  There is a stage that has performances several times a day. Between the park and the metro station there is a big shopping mall. So you could go the park, go shopping, eat and never have to go outside. Great for those cold rainy days.", July 2019
61,4.0,Daughter loves it!,"It was a rainy day in Seoul and I still wanted my daughter to experience Seoul. I remembered Lotte World was indoor and it would be something she would enjoy. She made little comments here and there about it not being Disney, but once she walked inside she loved everything she saw. Lines were pretty long, but that‚Äôs to be expected.  Fun little rides for the kids and little entertainment segments and even a photography section where you can take pics on your own camera making it a photo shoot.", August 2019
62,3.0,Kids paradise - we went on the wrong day!,"The theme park is pretty big with lots of rides and fully indoor so you don't have to worry about the rain. Young children, in particular, would love it here as it's really catered for them. One regret I had was that I visited on a public holiday, so together with tourists, local Koreans and their families thronged this place. Wished that I had bought the Magic Pass to skip the queues as some rides, you will need to wait up to 2 hours long!", August 2019
63,5.0,Fun amusement park in Seoul,Lotte World is an indoor/outdoor amusement park in Seoul which is easily accessible by public transportation.

65,2.0,Long lines and half the rides close early or are broken down. ,Doubt there is any safety regulations here like most public access places. They  close the rides early outside and some inside. Carousel horses are about the only ride open til closing time. Few restrooms available like most Korean public places. Very few exits for fire safety like most public places in Korea., October 2018

67,3.0,Too Busy,"I was overwhelmed by the sea of people.  I thought my toddler would be carried away with the tide so I had to hold her the entire time. The toddler rides were fun, and the 3 d Dr agon game was fun.", August 2019

71,1.0,Not english and baby friendly at all,"We got a baby and we have asked if we could take the ride before queueing up and Hans, the facilitator, said yes. After queueing up for 1.5hr, he refused us to take the ride and said we had to get him a baby ticket instead. It was absolutely unfair as I have double checked with him before queueing up, he should have let us know right from the beginning before letting us to queue up for so long so that we would get a baby ticket first. We were treated unfairly as no facilitator or sign has told us to get a baby ticket at the entrance nor at the ride. We actually have bought three adults tickets (which costed more) for 2 adults and a baby instead, we have shown the tickets to him, but still he insisted that we have to get a baby ticket instead. The facilitators there did not check any other tickets but us. :( We felt like we were treated differently just because we were not Korean. We were absolutely disappointed. Please don't go there if you can't speak Korean as non of them understand English properly.", July 2019

76,4.0,Lotte World (indoor amusement park),"This is one of the most famous amusement parks in Seoul. A trip to Seoul would never be complete without visiting this place. It is located at the city center , connecting to a mall and half of the rides are inside enclosed facility. It looks a bit crowded and I personally still prefer recreational parks in the open. If you are ""afraid of the sun"" then this is ideal for you. LOL!  Could have been better if the instructions were in English and the personnel knows how to speak as well.", August 2018

79,4.0,A fun outing for all!!,We had wanted to get there by 9:30 for opening time but didn‚Äôt quite make it until 11 am. My advice arrive to the mall for 9 - eat breakfast at the mall. We used Govoyagin to buy tickets on the spot for discounted tickets. The earlier you get there the shorter the lines. Our girls spent most of the day in lines. Our 7 yr old  son was able to go on rides for his age quite frequently. There is plenty of space to sit and rides for all ages. Overall a good way to spend the day., July 2019

84,3.0,Not the best theme park,"If you want to have an experience of Korean theme parks with lots of Korean people around, give it a try. But if you're a theme park fanatic, I'd give it a miss. I also found it disappointing that pretty much every outdoor ride shuts down when it rains. I understand safety must come first, but it was disappointing to have bought a fast pass and not be able to ride any of the rides I wanted to. I'm glad I went just to see it, but I wouldn't go back.", June 2019

The kids loved it and me too:) The park is huge and and I think it has enough attractions for little ones. The parade at 2:00 p.m was amazing the kids enjoyed it while eating ice cream. I loved the fact that the park has an indoor area and the outdoor which is great when there is not good weather or air quality.

So don‚Äôt be upset if they charged your guest.", May 2019
98,5.0,We loved it,"Went with my 7 year old daughter. For several of the rides we went on we did have to wait for about 20 mins. There were some long lines for the roller coaster and  the boat ride but I was not about to wait over 90 minutes to get on these. Plenty of food options. A great day out, with plenty of things that would interest all ages. Oh and if you pay for the tickets by Mastercard you get 20% discount on the admission price. That was a nice surprise which I did not know about!", April 2019
99,2.0,Not worth a visit,"Too crowded. Had to queue 3 hours+ for one single outdoor ride. Way too many people and it was not enjoyable at all. Not recommended. Perhaps the indoor rides would take a shorter time but overall, not enjoyable at all.", May 2019

109,2.0,Save your money and don't waste your time,"Perhaps this is a bit harsh and may not be the case if you have younger children, but if I could have a do-over, I would have skipped Lotte World.  We went with two teenagers and we found the rides to be meh and the long lines not worth the ride.  I can see how the park is popular with locals, but if you have limited time on your trip to Seoul, Lotte World is not worth the time or money.  I would recommend skipping it.", April 2019
110,4.0,Great for inside play,"I have been here a few times and a great place when it‚Äôs cold or raining. Great for teens. 110cm and 120cm seem to be the ideal heights to ride rides. Otherwise, children smaller than this will have limited access to rides.", April 2019

140,3.0,Indoor theme park for small kids,"The warmth in the indoor theme park was very welcome with the freezing cold outside. However, the indoor rides were more for smaller kids less than 12 years old probably. Very long queues on a holiday and weekend. We stayed in an AirBnB across the theme park so transportation was not a problem.", July 2018
141,3.0,Crowded and expensive,, December 2018
142,1.0,Below average park. ,"I guess because it's indoor there were more emphasis on VR rides and experiences. Not the place to go if you're looking for thrill rides. The queuing time was ridiculous - over a hour unless you have a magic pass. The signs for the rides or the facilities are not clear. I walked a full circle looking for the toilets to discover it was right where I was. The stairs and escalators were hard to find going up or down a floor. Some experiences you have to pay extra for and you don't know this unless you go up to it like the VR experience on B3. They had a tour pamphlet all in Korean with the ice rink in it and we thought it was part of Lotte World. The park staff on B3, with very poor English, so I think she said, we'll be exiting the park and reentry is not permitted. So to sum up. Spent most of my time going around a big circle looking for stairs and elevators to go up or down a floor to go around in a circle to look for rides and experiences which takes a hour of queuing because people with magic passes takes priority so they take up the seats first.", December 2018
143,4.0,Litre world,Avoid at Christmastime! Great place to visit but queuing for 2 hours for most rides took the shine off. I don't know how much a magic pass is but I think it would be worth investigating to go to the front of every line., December 2018

150,4.0,Good place for the kids to play the whole day,Indoor and outdoor theme park. Good for cold weather as you can just do the indoor rides. The museum on location is definitely worth a visit as well. Hidden gem. Quiet as most of crowd would be at the theme park. There are several eateries at the exit of the museum.  The eatery closest to the entrance of shopping mall offers cheap and good food as compared to the other eateries on the same floor. It is small and looks less expensive .. food is good value for money., December 2018

We were bored stiff despite spending a fortune on the entrance fee.", December 2018
154,1.0,Avoid,"Very disappointed.   Expensive, a lot of attractions closed and the best attractions cost extra, which is outrageous considering the high entry fee.   Even the ice skating rink required everyone to vacate after only 10 minutes.

Take a few minutes to locate all of the major rides/attractions inside and outside of the park. Some of the lines can be very long, but hey, most theme parks are. The indoor section looks very dated and there aren't as many spectacular rides. Roller coasters are a blast. Lots of food options too! There is enough to see for an entire day so plan ahead. Not a bad option for a day at a theme park.", September 2018

158,4.0,Moderate theme park,"The theme park is not big but it has all the rides and facilities. Most rides are for older child with height more than 110cm. We spent some time studying the  floor maps because the signage was not very clear. It was long queue during winter. We tried to use the magic pass but some rides did not accept the pass. Anyway, all of us were having great fun there. The parade was not very interesting. We were confused about the direction to get there initially because the area was a combination of mall, hotel and park. No signage to show us how to go to theme park from sunway. The exit of the subway is 1 or 2. And the park was located near the food departmental store.", December 2018

160,3.0,Cool,"Though I don't ride all the rides, I just embraced the view and surrounding, a moment when you wish you are young again. I don't think is as big as Everland that I heard of bring a huge place, but since here, the location is great and accessible by using metro when you do not have enough time while in Seoul but just enough to experience the moment of being young at heart.", November 2018
161,5.0,Too much fun definitely worth it,I went to Lotte World in October 2018. They have a wide selection of games and activities as well as different restaurants and stores. The quality of service is amazing. I went on a Wednesday or Thursday afternoon and the place was crowded. There are a large selection of private or vip rooms to cater for special occasions and business dinners. Can't wait to go back!, October 2018

163,4.0,What fun!!! ,"What a fun day at Lotte World! So many rides and lots to see. It is difficult to navigate around. There is so much packed in that you don't see all the rides unless you go down every street and every corner. It is really tough to find the stairs or escalators as well. Lines aren't long but the wait to get on a ride takes forever. They could introduce more efficientcy by counting passengers while the ride runs and limiting the number of Magic Passes allowed on a ride. We went on a Monday and not a super busy day, but wait times were 45-60 for the more popular rides.", November 2018
164,5.0,Omg,Actually everything there is amazing but the problem is all the time crowded and alot of people special after 12 pm but in weekend from when lotte world open until close they accept millions of people to much people and if you need to play sometimes you need to wating like one hour for one game or 2 hour i just suggest to visit there but in weekdays spical in middle of the week, November 2018
165,4.0,Quick-Wit-Tedness,"Lotte World is one of the most interesting places in Korea. We can also say Korean's Disney land. It places in Jamsil station of line 2. Since I was young, I went there and I also went there with my friends. Sometimes, I visited there from the school field trip. Mostly there are a lot of people that is why you should be quick-wittedness. We normally say we need to win on the quick-wittedness game which means that we need to go there when there are fewer people. Anyway, it would be good for you to enjoy Korea's amusement park.

One day is just sufficient to enjoy The place.", November 2018
174,4.0,Huge park that'll need more than a day,My kids were a little young to enjoy the rides fully (3 & 5 years old). The park attendants are quite strict on the minimum height restrictions. Older kids would definitely enjoy more. It has both an indoor and outdoor section so was good for the colder months., November 2018
175,4.0,A world in it's own -,The 'Lotte World' in Seoul is an Amusement Park in it's own. If you like water activities and other fun amusement it is worth spending time there. As it is not cheap you should allow time for best 'value for money'., May 2018
176,4.0,Great for kids,We went here with a young infant so didn‚Äôt explore outside as none of the rides would be suitable for our baby.

I would recommend coming here with young kids although it can get very busy., October 2018

Queues were crazy on the Friday we visited due to school-going kids of all ages. So if you‚Äôre really keen on getting on the rides on a Friday or weekend, do check it they sell fast passes. But definitely do avoid Fridays and weekends if you can. We went back to Lotte World for Pororo Park on Thursday and it was really rather quiet so do consider going on a weekday!", October 2018
