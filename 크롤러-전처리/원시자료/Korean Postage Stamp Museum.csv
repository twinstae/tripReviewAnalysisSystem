5,4.0,Quite Nice if You Like Stamps,"A great spot to visit if you are into the subject matter.  It obviously contains a whole lot of stamps.  There are stamps from around the world, as well as a comprehensive collection of Korean postage (including the very first stamps issued in the country).For a reasonable fee you can create legal stamps that feature your picture.There is a gift shop, but it sells a surprisingly limited number of stamps and annual books.", May 2018
6,5.0,Love Stamps? A Fun and Interactive Place,"Welcome to Stamp World! Formerly the Korean stamp museum, Stamp World is a fun, interactive museum housed in the main post office in Seoul. Not only is it filled with historical information, but it is also an interactive fun place to go - especially for kids. There are wooden cutouts and puzzles and dolls and games to spark your imagination. It also has wonderful examples of different types of stamps available to the public. You can buy postcards there at the little gift counter. There is a table where you can write out your note and they can sell you stamps so you mail the card on the spot! Really fun place to spend a couple of hours.", December 2016
7,2.0,Great if you love stamps,"I would think this to be a ridiculous place but to each his own. Had this been a sports cards museum, I would have been super excited and other people might think it is so boring so we all have our own preferences. I wasn’t disappointed because we didn’t know we were going to come here. We were just on our way to Myeongdong again; we seemed to have come here every day while we were in Korea and I saw this museum. I checked the price of admission and it was free. They have many exhibits again if you are into stamps, it’s worth checking out. Since I wasn’t, it was just ok but the place was very colorful and had English signs everywhere. We were there only about 20 minutes as that’s all my wife could bare. I could have stayed cla bit longer but I have to keep the wife happy. If you have some time to kill, go ahead and stop in here and check it out since it is free.", February 2016
8,5.0,A must for philatelists!,"All I wanted was to buy a few stamps from the post office, and when I saw the sign for museum, it was a moment of great joy! Inside, you will see the history of stamps all over the world, not only in Korea; and samples from other countries, as well as extra-ordinary ones. There are nice games for children. You can also make a stamp of your selves by taking a photo there!", June 2015
