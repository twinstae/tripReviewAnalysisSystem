0,5.0,Superb! Chose your level,"Amazing place we wanted to do it for fun enjoying and we asked at the entrance the forest Guard what to do. I ll add the map and the beautiful pictures of the temple there. A big harder at the end for non sportive but OK. Something to do for the view of the city from there, the", February 2020
1,5.0,"Easy hike, safe for solo hiker.","It is a relatively easy hike even for those without hiking experience. The trails is easy to navigate, it should take not more than 6 hours (return trip) for beginners. The only difficult part is near the peak due to steep climb.   Went there in late October when the leaves", October 2019
2,5.0,great escape from the city,"great hiking and scenery. Peaceful. AFAIK, it's a completely healthy and wholesome day out in nature.", February 2020
3,5.0,Well worth checking out,I arrived into Seoul at the New Year celebrations and found that the transport was fully booked and everything in Seoul would be closed. the lady at the hotel recommend this place. I went more for something to do while waiting for my flight the next day but was so pleasantly surprised. Its a beautiful National Park with really really nice hiking. The top rock scrambling is also fun if you aren't afraid of heights. it ended up being one of the highlights of my trip! If you like nature then I really recommend it., February 2020
4,5.0,One of best trekking trails,"Four of us took subway and continued with bus to the place. We overestimated that it is easy trail but the fact very tough in cold and partly snow which made it slippery. The best trail we had with scenery, stones, frozen rivers and finally we reached Bogungmun gate one of the castle’s gates. Another tough and different going down and took us 5 hours to complete.", January 2020
5,5.0,Beautiful hiking!,It's amazing that there is accessible hiking within the heart of Seoul. Different seasons offer beautiful scenery and breathtaking views., January 2020
6,5.0,The view is worth it,"Come prepared with: water, food, good hiking shoes, and a healthy respect for the difficulty of the trail. I, a naive fool of a tourist who reluctantly works out 3 times a week, thought we could start our hike at 11am, pull off the short “difficult” trail (we did the trail to Baegundae from the fortress entrance to Ui-dong) in shoes with no grip whatsoever, and chill out at a cafe by 5pm. In early January. I slipped on ice twice, got in the way of many other local hikers who had clearly planned their hike better than I did, ran out of water at the peak (which was halfway through the trail), and minced my way down the snowy part second half with very cheap strap-on crampons (4-pronged, KRW7k from a roadside stall near the first entrance, I probably could have haggled). We eventually made it out of the park at 530pm. Which was sunset.Don’t be me. Plan your hike. Be as awesome as this view.", January 2020
7,5.0,Bukhansan National Park,Travelled to Bukhansan national park with my parents during winter (dec 2019). Pleasant atmosphere and serene hiking experience. Would recommend making a day trip up to enjoy the fresh air:), December 2019
8,4.0,Demanding mountain hiking,"You'd better be well equipped to hike up to the peak of Bukhansan as it is quite a demanding trail.  However, you will be well compensated by the beautiful scenery!  Take enough water as there is non to buy on the way.", November 2019
9,5.0,Various trails available to reach the highest peak Baegundae,"Depending on your accommodation, there are different trailheads to reach the highest peak Baegundae peak. I personally started at Bukhansan Information Center where there are two different trails. The difficult (steeper) trail is just under 3km while the easy trail (didn’t attempt it) trail is slightly over 4km. On the difficult trail, there are a lot of steps, and you need to use the steel cable to overcome the vertical gaps at some point of time. When you finally see some walls, it means you are nearing the peak. To actually reach the peak, you need to use the steel cables to pull yourself up either the slopes or the steps. If you arrived late in winter, there’s going to be a long queue wanting to take the steps cos the slopes are just too slippy. Regardless the view at the peak is magnificent on a clear day. I took a third trail down the eastern side of the mountain to have a different feel of the mountain. Have fun hiking.", December 2019
10,5.0,beautiful hike right outside the city!,Super easy to get to - just take the bus it's about 40 minutes from Insadong. Beautiful trail and pretty views that you can see from the guard's tower/wall area. I did not climb all the way tot he top of the mountain as I did not have that much time. The nice thing is there are many trails so you can walk for as long or as short as you like. Definitely worth  checking out!, March 2019
11,5.0,A challenging hiking place,"Easy when it is at the beginning part of the mountain. However, it gets really steep and quite dangerous when reaching the summit of the mountain. Do get proper hiking equipment such as hiking shoe as sport shoe is too slippery. Spend 4 hours going up, and 4 hours down. Never climb down during the evening as it gets really dark and dangerous. Overall it was a great experience, would definitely want to go back again.", October 2019
12,5.0,Great and challenging hiking,"Don't be fooled by the casual demeanour of the Korean hikers, and the neatness and cleanliness of their equipment. If you get up into the peaks of Bukhansan you may find yourself descending a cliff with only a steel cable or an iron bar to hold on to. Safety ropes are for sissies and westerners, apparently. But it is beautiful to be out among nature (but solitude is not guaranteed, you may find yourself in a throng of Korean hikers). I strongly recommend October to see the red maple leaves, so different than the North American maples. Some parts are accessible by subway (Dobongsan and Mangwolsa stations) and others by bus. Anything you need before (such as lunch or a forgotten item of clothing or equipment) or after the hike (such as food and beer) can be purchased between the subway stations and the mountain.", October 2019
13,5.0,Prachtig!!,"Een van ‘s werelds populairste hiking trails is Bukhansan Mountain.Dit is een prachtig berglandschap, vlot te bereiken met het openbaar vervoer vanuit Seoul. Het meest uitgelezen tijdstip voor zijn beklimming is oktober tot november, vermits de herfstkleuren het landschap dan in een schilderachtig tafereel omtoveren.Er zijn meerdere trajecten  mogelijk, doch de mooiste tocht is deze van Bukhansanseong Fortress tot aan Baegundae, de hoogste piek. Een pittige wandeling waarbij het laatste deel zelfs wat avontuurlijk is. Om de steile paden te beklimmen zijn de staalkabels die aan de rand van het pad gespannen zijn een welkome hulp.  De fenomenale uitzichten van op de top maken de inspanning meer dan waard. Als het meezit met de smog krijg je een uitzicht over heel Seoul en omstreken. Wauw.Afdalen kan je langs de andere zijde van de berg, langs de oude stadsmuren. De tocht neemt zonder pauze zo’n 5uur in beslag.One of the world's most popular hiking trails is Bukhansan Mountain.This is a beautiful mountain landscape, easily accessible by public transport from Seoul. The most suitable time for his ascent is October to November, since the autumn colors transform the landscape into a picturesque scene.Multiple routes are possible, but the most beautiful trip is from Bukhansanseong Fortress to Baegundae, the highest peak. A tough walk where the last part is even more adventurous. To climb the steep paths, the steel cables that are tensioned at the edge of the path are a welcome help. The phenomenal views from the top make the effort absolutely worthwhile. If there is not too much smog you get a view of the entire Seoul area. Wow.You can descend on the other side of the mountain, along the old city walls. The trip takes about 5 hours without a break.", November 2019
14,5.0,Baegundae Peak - worthwile,"Easy to get to the start of the hike via metro and bus (Gupabal station, line 3, exit 1 followed by 704 bus). I did the gorge path up which I understand to be slightly more difficult. Yes it was tough going, but so worth the experience at the top. I went at 8am on a Monday morning so there were very few other hikers. The most worthwhile day in Seoul!", November 2019
15,5.0,"Amazing view, climb not awful either","Let me get this straight, I'm not a climber and I haven't been to the gym in over 3 years. I have a decent staminia though. Not having a fear of heights was also helpful in my case.When visiting Seoul last summer, I decided to climb Baegundae peak because ... why not?I was wearing shorts, stockings and $5 primark shoes which were almost falling apart: perfect climbing gear, right? I was smart enough to pack 2L of water and lunch though. I went on a Monday I believe around 9:30 AM. The park ranger was super kind to me, but he made fun of my shoes lmao. He provided me with a map and drew a route for to climb. The first 1,5 hours up were AWFUL. I'm sure ANY other way up would have been better, but I spent the first 1,5 hours climbing uneven, very high stairs and it was almost bad enough for me to quit. During this period I only passed a couple of other people, which was really odd to me, since in other people's reviews I read that the hike is always busy.I started at the Jeongneun parking lot and made my way up to Youngchusa. This part is in the middle of the forrest and this is the part where I was just doing nothing but climbing stairs. I passed Daeseongmun and Bogungmun and this part was super nice, literally like taking a walk in the park. I decided to continue. The forrest ended and very suddenly I was confronted with how high up I was as I was on the edge of a cliff. It was very intimidating at first, but I soon got an adrenaline rush and was excited to make my way up. The next part I spent climbing on all fours over huge rocks and pulling myself up. I didn't find this hardly as draining as climbing the stairs though, and it was honestly very fun.  The view from Baegundae peak is kinda unreal and it was really relaxing to sit down and eat my lunch. The locals were also super nice to me and pulled out their best english skills to have a conversation with me: why are you alone? Why are you wearing these shoes? The park ranger had told me to make my way back down to Ui-dong, which I think took me about 1,5 hours. The climb down was really nice and I came across a small shop, where I purchased some more water. There was also a traditional-style restroom which is not for the squeamish, but hey, I had to go after drinking all that water. After arriving in Ui-dong, my very sweaty self made her way back to the nearest subway station and went back to Hongdae.Over all, the walk was really nice after it was more than just climbing stairs. The view is beautiful and the adreneline rush is real. Not sure how difficult it is, since I haven't done a lot of hiking in my life, but for someone with average stamina it's deffos do-able.", August 2019
16,4.0,A tough climb but worth the view.,"A would say you need to have decent decent footwear and I recommend padded/gripped gloves as well. In the later parts of the hike you have to climb over boulders and pull yourself up smooth rock whilst holding onto a wire rope. Gloves certainly made it easier. The views from the top are amazing, some of the best views of Seoul, and it really gives a scale of how big the city is. The down side though is getting there is a chore. The subway station that is closest is still bus ride away, and its a very popular route and you will be waiting a very long time to get on the bus. I decided to walk to the entrance to the park, which I would not recommend. Also there are multiple routes to the top, and I couldn't find any kind of visitor centre at the bottom to get a map.So when you start heading up there is no way of knowing if your are going up a harder route or an easy route. And in fact since the routes criss cross its very easy to go a much longer route. Also the ascent is mostly covered by forest so you really don't appreciate your altitude. The first time you come out of the forest you look out over a cliff and it really hits you hard. I'm not scared of heights but that sudden look over a cliff face still came as a shock. I would say its a reasonably tough climb as well. I wouldn't recommend trying to climb this unless you hike regularly.", September 2019
17,5.0,Beautiful,It was really gorgeous. I love walking around and drowning in the beauty of nature. Fresh air and nice weather thou, September 2019
18,3.0,You need to be fit for the climb up,"Its amazing that older Koreans of 60+ age can climb the Bukhansan mountain with ease. The climb is quite steep and rocky. The trails are not always that clearly marked out. You definitely need good hiking shoes and walking sticks will also be a great help. Don't forget to bring food and water. You can fill your water in streams on some of the trails. Toilets are few, far and minimal. Its something different to do in Seoul if you are fit for the climb.", October 2019
19,5.0,Experience Korea,"If you like to hike, or simply take a long walk in nature while staying in Seoul, this could be the answer for you. Quite near the city . Nice views. You should bring along comfortable hiking shoes.Plan a half day; bring a snack/lunch.", September 2019
20,5.0,Wonderful hiking ,"We are a family of four with two children (4,7). We started hiking up towards Baegundae Peak, however with the 2 kids we made it with in about 1.5k from the top. My 7 year old was fine, but my 4 year old had to be carried by daddy the further we went up. The hike was just lovely...wonderful smells, fantastic views, the nature was just gorgeous. We hiked about 4.5 hours with my kids. Stopped for lunch break (brought lunch) half way. Even if you don’t hike, I think the park is definitely something to visit to leave the hustle and bustle of the city.", October 2019
21,5.0,Beautiful spot...,Bukhansan National Park is a beautiful spot with spectacular views looking up and down... a nice reward during and after an enjoyable hike!, August 2019
22,5.0,Hiking to the Peak of Baegundae Mountain,"Great mountain hiking, spectacular views over the city of Seoul and just a quick transit from the city. We can see Seoul city at the top of the Mountain but the weather just a little bit cloudy. View the weather cast before hiking up .", October 2019
23,4.0,Then need better maps,Brilliant hiking but quite a few climbs. We did not get lost but were never where we thought we were.Lots of friendly people. Take more water than you would expect. Easy to get to from the metro - just follow the other walkers, October 2019
24,5.0,gorgeous views,"Spent the afternoon hiking this amazing area.  Vigorous hiking, so wear good shoes.  Views of Seoul are spectacular", September 2019
25,5.0,Fantastic hiking and great views,"For those who enjoy hiking, this is a great way to get the legs moving and see some great views of Seoul from above. I would warn that the hike is tough, so only recommended for those with hiking experience.I entered at the West side by taking the subway to Gupabal, then walking 30 mins to the park entrance (You can also take bus 704). I then hiked to the Baegundae peak via the ""easy"" route (as opposed to the ""expert"" route), then came down the mountain on the East side, eventually leading to Bukhansan Ui subway station. The whole hike took around 6 hours.Make sure you take plenty of water and snacks as there are no places to buy these after around 1km in. On the way down, there is a shop selling drinks, snacks and basic pot-noodle style meals at the Bukhansanseong fortress on the East side of the peak.Entry to the national park is free. Make sure you wear good hiking shoes as the terrain gets tough towards the top.", October 2019
26,5.0,A great way to take a break from city touring,Wear shoes with good treads and head to the mountains. We loved our day hiking and  would recommend this area to anyone who enjoys beautiful hiking trails., September 2019
27,1.0,"nice hike, but horrible bus driver","we did the most difficult hike, which was absolutely stunning. when we got back, we wanted to take a shuttle bus to the nearest station, like a lot of people were doing.However, when the bus arrived, only locals were allowed to enter. The bus driver literally grabbed us and pulled us away from the shuttle bus and started shouting angrily. Since we can't speak Korean, and he didn't respond in English, this Korean girl started talking with him. He wouldn't give a reason as to why we weren't allowed to join and eventually we had to walk back ourselves to the nearest station. He told us to take a cab.I guess racism isn't gone after all... If anyone knows which company this shuttle bus service belongs to, please let me know.", September 2019
28,5.0,An amazing park right by the city,"This is an amazing park with surprisingly good hiking, that you can get to by taking the metro. It is extremely popular and basically every day there are people everywhere, but you can still enjoy a quiet hike. Note that many of the hikes, even the ones labeled Intermediate, are non-trivial. Don't assume that because you see a group of retirees while hiking that the trail is easy! It's generally steep and rocky so be ready for hills. If you have a free day and good shoes, this is totally worth doing.", September 2019
29,5.0,Enjoyable moment,"How to go: from Gupabal station take bus no 704 to Bukhansenseong and walk in 10mins to the park entrance. Ticket fee is only 1000krw. After 35-45 mins of waking, you will choose betwen hard route and easy route. For Hard route, it's a challenging hike, quite tall and steep. On the way to Baegundae Peak, you have to climb on the steep and flat rock in the last section. But the view from the peak is amazing. Summer is too hot so I recommend you to be here in spring or autumn. When I went back, I didn't choose the same route, I chose Baegundae route, only took 1.5 hours. After get out of the park, I took bus no 120 to go to Suyu station. You should bring sthing to eat and drink (snack, water, lunch..) by urself. Total hiking and taking a rest is 5hrs (only for me). Not many foreigners hike here, most of hikers are Korean ppl, especially the middle-aged, and the elderly ppl.", July 2019
30,5.0,Must do if you're in Seoul!,"We reached Gupabal at around 1020, took bus 704, following the people all decked in hiking outfits. Then there is a 7 minute walk to the base/ information centre. We started hiking up at about 1050 to BAEGEUNDAE peak. We probably walked about 1.5km before there was a big rest stop. Following that, there was 2 options to the peak - 2.4km advanced train & 4.1km easy trail. We kept right and went with the easy trail. Good thing about the easy trail is that it passes a long stretch of fortress walls, which was nice(pictured). We went on a non crowded day and at some points, we were the only ones on the trail and we might have gotten lost. The last ascent is quite steep and was quite challenging. But it is quite worth it!Going down, we followed a sign that said 2km to base (forgot the exact description). It was quite arduous, very steep and rocky. When we reached the base, we realised that it wasnt the same base as where we started. Instead, we had to walk a further 2km to the Bukhansan Ui station.In total, we took 3h to go up and 2h to go down. All in all, it was entirely worth it.If you can, I would reccommend bringing hiking shoes instead of trainers, or at least the grippiest pair of shoes you have. Certain routes and especially near the peak, it's mainly just walking along rocks which can be very slippery.", August 2019
31,5.0,On top of Seoul,"I went to Bukhansan in September of 2018. It was a great experience. I was grateful that it was easy to get to the base of the trail from the subway/metro. I was 23, so I had youthful energy, but I believe it took me around 2 - 3 hours to reach the top. There were many older people scaling the mountain as well so I don't think it's a problem, and you don't feel alone doing it. Bring water, sunscreen, mosquito repellent, and snacks (basically, your standard hiking equipment)!", September 2018
32,5.0,A good place to forget about the hectic city.,I got on foot. I got a lot of pleasure and good photo galleries. Great views! In foggy weather visibility may be reduced. Take the road drinking water is useful., July 2019
33,5.0,So peaceful,My daughter and I went there and walked up the mountain. It's so peaceful and beautiful once up the mountain you can see the city ., March 2019
34,5.0,Mangwolsa Tempel ,"Worth the clime...My condition is not perfect at all. But ones you are at the Bouda temple you forget the clime.It is perfect!In a perfect setting.As it was, originally..... not many tourists at all. Not during the week any way.", June 2019
35,5.0,Just do it! its worth it.,"Hiking up Bukhansan mountain is not easy, especially the last 500 m or so, but it is definitely worth it. We did it with two children in tow (9 and 13 years old) and they were able to conquer the mountain. In total, it took us about 5 hours there and back. the view from the top is spectacular.", July 2019
36,5.0,Popular among the local hikers,"I took the subway and arrived Gupabal station around 09:30hr. At the exit, there are already a group of local hikers queuing at the bus stop. They were all dressed in outdoor performance, which is part of their passion too. I joined the queue waiting for bus 704. However, when bus 8772 arrived, the local hikers were boarding the bus. I just followed suit as it could not be wrong, Entire bus is packed with hikers. Bus ride is only 10 mins ending at final stop. From the bus stop to the park entrance is a 15 mins walk. Along the way, I bought an isotonic drink from a mini mart, and kimbap, 2,500 won, from a street vendor. There is no entrance fee. At the base, there are many trails to various parts of the mountain. I just followed the crowd. Later on, I followed signs that point towards Baegundae Peak. The beginning part was easy, along well paved paths, stepping on large rocks, boardwalks as well as steel stairs. However, it got tougher with steeper incline. Towards the last 400m, I needed to use ropes, already anchored to ground, to pull myself up the granite slopes. Suggest to bring along gloves.I took about 3 hours to arrive at Baegundae peak. The summit is just a small platform with a Korean flag and a large stone inscribed with figure 836m. I needed to queue for 20 mins just to take photos, as the short stretch to the summit is narrow and single lane. After that, like all hikers, I rested just below the summit in the open space ground. I had my kimbap for lunch while enjoying the beautiful view - truly majestic, surrounded by multiple peaks against the clear blue sky. Overall, I was glad I finally managed to hike highest peak of Bukhansan National Park.", June 2019
37,5.0,Amazing but I wish I was 20 years younger,"Amazing plants, butterflies and birds. But tough trails if you are above 55. Koreans how ever - old ladies 65+ passed us like nothing and we are reaonably fit...", July 2019
38,5.0,Nature so close to the city,Nice place to escape the stress of the city and breath some nice air. Recommend going witin the week., May 2019
39,5.0,Beautiful Hike Right Outside Seoul,"I hiked up Baegundae peak, the tallest mountain in Bukhansan National Park, on my last day in Seoul.  It was completely worth it.  It's quite approachable in an afternoon, but just make sure that you have OK footwear.  I just wore tennis shoes, which worked OK, but I did slip and fall once on some loose rocks.  It also can be quite windy at the top.  The views of the surrounding park and Seoul are wonderful, and completely worth the trip if you at all enjoy hiking.  It's very easy to get to Bukhansan from the metro and buses, and quite cheap too.  If you're not sure you're at the right stop for the bus, it's usually quite obvious, because all the Koreans in colorful hiking gear will get off.Overall, I would highly recommend Bukhansan for anyone who loves the outdoors who is visiting Seoul.  It's a very beautiful area.", June 2019
40,5.0,Life's a climb and the view is great,"Bukhansan, B in Korean is pronounced as P ""Puk’ansan"" -  Tallest Peak is Baegundae Peak at 836 m / 2,744 ft.Take Subway line 3 to Gupabal Station and get out at Exit 1. 180 degree turn around to the bus stop. Take Bus # 34/704/8772 bound for Bukhansanseong Fortress to the Bukhansan Mountain entrance bus stop (20 mins). 6 stops total, off at Bukhansan Ipgu, after Heongkuksa.‎ Sign in english in the bus. Turn left on exit of the bus, walk up to the next cross street and turn right (toward mtn). Stores along route to top up on food/drinks/gears if reqr. Can purchase a map at entrance for KRW $1000 or use sign posts and maps along the routes. At the last washroom, there is a bridge crossing the stream. Do not cross but use the dirt trail south of the stream, it's an interpretive trail (shorter & less travel) or take main trail (paved then packed). Both routes will link up near a bridge in order to cross the bridge.I returned down the other side of the mountain along the old fortress wall through Daedongmun Gate route to Akademi Info Center. Once outside the park, walk down maybe 50 m to the bus stop. Catch Bus #1 to Suyu metro station on line 4.From Bukhansanseong Info center to Baegundae Peak approx 4.3 kms. From peak to Akademi Info Center approx 4.8 kms. Time for each leg based on your fitness level and crowds on the trail(s). I did it on Friday 14 Jun starting at 1pm from the entrance. Low crowds.

42,5.0,Tough but fun,Bukhansan is the highest mountain around Seoul. it is quite tough if you have worked out for long time. It has beautiful steams along the trail and view from the peak is amazing!!, March 2019
43,5.0,Beautiful hike!,"My brother and I climbed up to the Baegundae peak, which is the highest one in the park. It was a great hike and the top was quite spectacular. However make sure to have great shoes. The last bit of the trail is very steep, sometimes slippery (even on a sunny day) and you have to pull onto ropes to climb. I could easily imagine that people who are too reckless  could very well fall and seriously injure themselves!", May 2019
44,5.0,Great Place for Hike and Views,This is a great place to hike and enjoy some stunning views of seoul. Easily reachable from any part of seoul.  Must see place in Seoul., May 2019
45,5.0,Great BUT,"Really easy to get to by public bus.ButIt’s serious hiking.We did a 2.5 hour one way which was uphill and over rock trails the whole way. All the locals are in hiking shoes and using hiking poles.We hoped to get away with casual shoes, but after 5 Kms taking almost 5 hours, you get a sense that it’s steep up and down. Ours was deemed one of the easier walks and classified intermediate. Would not take children or anyone with health problems.Great views, helped the aching legs.Would also mention that despite some good signage, there are many times when the path seems to have multiple options with no sign. We got lost once and discovered that many locals go off the trail on their own to find somewhere quiet. There are many options for this and so it can be hard to know what is and isn’t a trail", May 2019
46,4.0,"Great climb, rewarding view ","We checked out a lot of reviews and decided to climb Bukhansan based on the good feedback. It was indeed a fantastic climb with varying treks of cobbled path, stone steps, man made stairs and rock climbing. We started rather late at 1130am, but in hindsight was glad that we did as we missed the crowd entirely. The weather was perfect and didn’t get too hot at all, forecasted at 23deg. It took us just about 2hours to get to the peak. According to the iPhone health app, we climbed 200floors! Coming down though, we had read reviews about coming down the trail and getting to the Suyu Train station and was planning for that. We asked the guide at the peak which way to go and he pointed us in the direction saying it was a 1.5hr trek down. We walked for about 1hr and reached what seemed to be the base, the Begundae Information Centre, only to realise the actual base was a further 30-45minutes down a driveway road with pretty heavy traffic. The train station at this end was the Uri Station, not Suyu. We’re not sure where we went wrong as there was only seemingly 2 ways to go at the top.In any case, there are taxis that will take you down to Uri station for 1000won per person, they will even squeeze 5 passengers in to maximise their profit. At this stage we were beyond exhausted and was glad to pay that 1buck for the 5-7min car ride. So if you have to hurry and want to do this hike, our journey only took us 4hours in total including stopping for a bite and photos along the way.", May 2019

48,5.0,Great trekking,"We took 2,5 hours (ca 4 km) trekking route to the peak. Good path, nice view, but also a bit challenging. I did not have any sports shoes and it was doable! Shoes have to be comfortable and reasonable sole.", May 2019
49,5.0,Breathtaking view of Seoul city & Nature,"It's very accessible and can reach the peak of the mountain within 2hr and 30min. The hiking course was intermediate and had tough short course before reaching the peak, but it's all worth the effort to hike to the top. Recommended to...- prepare hiking gloves for need to climb up holding to metal wire ropes- bring a bottle of  (iced)water. If you prefer to hike light, there is resting area on the middle spot where u can buy iced water for ₩2,000. - small snack to nibble on as there are few  amazing spots where u can eat while enjoying the amazing view. Not recommended to...- wear jeans", May 2019
50,5.0,Highest in Seoul,"if you want to take an excellent view of Seoul, take the challenge and climb all the way up. Follow the correct trail to get to the Baegundae peak which stands at 840m above sea level. Equip yourself with hiking gear if you want to head all the way up as there are slippery slopes near the top. Dint make it all the way up as i did not wear the correct shoes. there is no stones or steps to head to the peak when you are near 20m away.", April 2019
51,5.0,Epic hiking,Most reviews I read talked about approaching the peak from the west side of the park. That takes a metro and bus to get to. They also talked about crowds. There are 10 entrances. I chose to enter from Dobongsan side on the east. It’s a mile from the metro stop so you can just walk there and it was very sparsely populated. Really an amazing park so close to an urban area. It’s very rocky and solid shoes are a must., May 2019
52,5.0,True hiking in Seoul,"Really amazing hiking. There weren't that many flowers when I visited in early April.- The shortest route for Baegundae Summit is to start from Ui Line 'Bukhansan Ui' Station and coming back.- My recommmendation is Bukhansan Ui Station-Ui Ranger Station(Baegun Visitor Center)-Harujae-Baegunbong Ammun Gate-Baegundae Summit-Baegunbong Ammun Gate(passing)-Yongammun Gate-Doseonsa Temple-Ui Ranger Station.- Other popular starting point is Gupabal Station. So, the route of starting from here and ending at Bukhansan Ui Station is also popular.- It was more challenging than I thought. Some tracks require grabbing railings or ropes. But, if you concentrate, it's not that risky. A fatigue will be an enemy too.- For those who jump into the Bukhansan and are afraid of hiking, there are other walk-around courses called as Bukhansan Dule-gil. This is more recommended to kids and seniors.", April 2019
53,5.0,"Excellent Hiking/Views - but ""Easy"" trail is quite tricky :(","3 adults.  A lovely experience near the city, particularly if you can make it to the top!  DO go to the Information Centre first where an interactive screen explains the routes - and they give you a free map.  The EASY route was the 'Easiest', but still tricky for those with frail knees :(  The rocky path got steeper and steeper.)  This was the trail from Bukhansan National Park Visitor Centre at Jeongneung-dong.  Perhaps the walking section at Sonamusup-jil is easier? but we didn't go there.  However, The blossom was beautiful and the view from the top, superb!For those who use the underground system, there is a station 'Bogungmun' which is only 4 stops away on the 110A bus.  Otherwise, get a taxi. About Won 5,000.Be prepared : good walking boots/sturdy trainers, hat & water bottle. :)  It says no pets allowed, but I don't know about service animals?  Picnic? There is a lovely, shaded  'Teahouse' at the beginning.", April 2019
54,5.0,Amazing Hike for beginners & experienced alike,"We trekked up the Bukhansan as part of a team building activity and it surely worked. The trail starts right from the bottom (although there is a way to drive up halfway), and it starts very gently at first, with walkways past narrow streams and wooden bridges.But once you cross the Buddha temple halfway true, the 2nd half of the journey to the top is what needs more skill & teamwork.We had the added challenge of rain once we reached the top, so our journey down was even more challenging & worth the fun.Overall, the visit is a must do, for kids & adults alike, for beginners & pro climbers alike.", October 2018
55,5.0,Majestic rocky mountain just north of central Seoul!,"This mountain is perfectly located just north of Seoul.     It offers several hiking trail options but due to its height and steep gradient, it is definitely not recommended for everyone though.     Some of the rocky hills are massive and truly impressive to look at.    Really enjoyed hiking here for a few hours.", April 2019
56,5.0,A Rocky Mountain for All Hikers,"Every time I am in Seoul, I always try to go hiking in Bukhansan National Park.  It is easily accessible by trains and buses.  This time I took Bus #704 in front of my hotel to Bukhansanseong (Fortress) Entrance.  On the way it stopped at Gupabal Station, where many hikers got on the bus.Bukhansan is a rocky mountain.  After the Bukhansanseong Information Center there are two choices: an intermediate course and an expert course.  I chose the latter toward Uisangbong (Uisang Peak).  At several places, there are steel cables to help you go up the steep granite.  At some places you have a nice view of parts of Seoul.Rather than going up to Daenammun (Great South Gate), I made a loop of four hours.  Near the end is Deog-am-sa (Virtuous Rock Temple), whose main hall with three Buddha statues is in a stone cave, which is the temple’s unique feature.I look forward to going on another hike at Bukhansan.", April 2019
57,5.0,Beautiful Fall Foliage - Multiple Routes to Apex,"As an experienced hiker (for comparison, I did the longest route up and down Mt. Halla in just under 5 hours), I took the longest/hardest route to the top, which was quite fun. For less experienced hikers, there are easier and shorter paths to the top. The path I took had an area where you had to climb up rocks assisted by a sturdy rope that was installed at the top. Along the way, I found a wild snake among the rocks and saw some other animals and birds you'd never see in the city center. It was a nice escape to nature from bustling city life in central Seoul. The fall foliage was beautiful (although not quite at their peak as I went in late-September) and I imagine going here on any clear day (when the air quality is decent) would be well worth it for those who enjoy outdoor activities. The entire hike up took about an hour and another hour down with some time spent at the top and short photo breaks along the way. The trail I took was incredibly peaceful (there was literally no one else there), and I thoroughly enjoyed the solitude being in nature... until I got closer to the top, then there were a ton of other hikers :D.", September 2018
58,5.0,Beautiful spring hike,"Bukhansan National Park is in the middle of town and with the exception of one other group, the trail to the temples was empty on a mid-Monday morning; an unexpected treat. The forest was blooming and our walk was the perfect break from the city bustle. We would have never found the trailhead without a guide but otherwise the trails are well traveled and well marked.", April 2019
59,5.0,This is a real hike!,"Hiking along the Seoul City Wall is very rewarding because of the stunning views to enjoy. But the path is steep and your knees should be in good condition. Take your water bottle, you will need it when temperatures rise.", April 2019
60,5.0,Take a day to hike this mountain,"My very first hiking experience was Bukhansan, starting from Bukhansanseong and hiking up to Baegundae peak. The trails are beautiful and I got a lot of great nature shots along the way. The people I met on this hike were all very nice and friendly and when I got lost on my way down, a man volunteered to guide me all the way down and even all the way to the subway station. I had a great experience on Bukhansan.", March 2019
61,4.0,Excellent,"Excellent place for multiple hiking trails, various difficulties.We arrived at the entrance via Dobongsan station following the flow of Korean walkers in mountain-climbing gear.We went up to Uiam rock by Gubongsa and Cheonjinsa in 1200. Ascension sportive, it must be in good condition. Lunch break on the rocks with beautiful views of Seoul and the mountains", January 2019
62,5.0,Need to do,"First visit to Seoul and worried due to language barrier and lack of info bubeforehand. However , it was so easy to get there. Took line 3(orange line) to Gudapal station , exit 1 and right away saw bus stop and took bus 704. You can see street signs leading to Bukhasan park and follow other hikers to get off. Park is in a suberb in very modern pretty area and gave us the feel of a ski resort village when you arrive at entrance. We went up to highest peak and found it challenging but it was totally worth it. Make sure you do carry lunch, water, hiking shoes (no tennis shoes), and flexible pants or shorts.  There are temples , waterfalls , restrooms and beautiful views on way up.", March 2019
63,5.0,Beautiful views & perfect amount of challenge -- if you're prepared!,"MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT GEAR -- crampons and hiking shoes as a bare minimum! The trails up to the mountains (we went up Jaunbong and Podae Peaks and stayed around the Dobongju, Podae, and Sapae Ridgelines) are manageable, but they can get dangerous if you're like us, who only had running shoes on hand. The way up from Dobongsan Station was fine, but the far side of the mountain was covered in snow, and trying to get down without gear turned into an impromptu sledding experience. No serious injuries or anything -- it was actually kind of funny -- but we had a lot of close shaves. You'll have a great time here if you do it right rather than doing it like us. Directions we took: the 1 subway line in the Soyosan direction to Dobongsan Station (it opens up to a street with clear signage and a lot of little stores that sell hiking gear, which is super helpful!). On the way back: exited via the Hoeryong Info Center, walked for around 15 min (again, signage was pretty clear & also in English), and took the 1 line in the Incheon direction from Hoeryong Station.", March 2019

65,5.0,A must visit for nature lovers and hikers,"This place is located just outside Seoul and can be reached via an hour public bus ride from Central bus station. The park is well marked and hiking up the various peaks are well directed.The hike up and down is not easy with medium level of difficulty. Certain areas are accessible with the help of ropes or chains.There are many streams and floral scenes along the way.The view on top , at about 1000 m above sea level, is awesome with a good 360 degree view of the surroundings and distant view of Seoul.", May 2018
66,5.0,A mind blowing hike just outside of Seoul,"Bukhansan national park can be reached by taking subway line 3 to Gupabal Station. If you get out at Exit 1, you can take bus 704 to Bukhansanseoun Fortress. The main peak is called Baegundae peak which takes quite a bit of effort to get toWe came during low season in the middle of winter (it was -14 degrees celcius at the time!). Although it was super cold, there were still quite a lot of hikers during the day. We recommend bringing ample food and drink on the way up as you will struggle otherwise. Whilst it was the dead of winter we did not encounter snow on the day, and i think were there snow, this hike would have been a lot harder. There are many intermediate and beginnner paths, but to get to the main peak, you will need to walk through difficult and what looks quite extreme for the average walker. I do quite a lot of hikes during my holidays but the final 30m or so is no piece of cake. There are metal cables attached to metal poles in the mountain side and parts of it requires all your strength to get up. During the peak season, i assume you may need to wait around to get up as you will have hordes of tourists trying to come the opposite direction. You may be greeted by families of mountain cats at the topBe prepared for extreme wind up there!One tip we learned was to make sure you have ample time to come down. It took a bit longer to descend due to the steepness and if you descent the way you came up, you will catch the afternoon sun. Make sure you reach the paved path before nightfall as there is very little light pollution on the mountain paths and you will struggle if it is pitch black!", December 2018
