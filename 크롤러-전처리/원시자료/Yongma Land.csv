0,5.0,More fun than in working amusement park,Finally amusement park without lines and sugar rushed kids who yell and run around - we totally enjoyed the place and had way more fun than we would have in normal amusement park! We were only visitors there at the time. Easily you can spend hours there so book some time., July 2019
1,4.0,Interesting abandoned amusement park,"This amusement park graveyard is kind of creepy and sad but good for photos, films or drawing. It stopped operation in 2011 and since that everything just gets more rusty. For some reason it is not maintained well so year by year things get broken. I wouldn't recommend it for small children. You can get nice photos and I don't think there are many this kind of places left. Park was built around 1980 and there is still that 1980's feeling.", July 2019
2,5.0,So cool for photos!,"This is a great and quirky little break away from the hustle and bustle of the city and perfect for unique photographs. The amusement park has no limits or boundaries so it's easy to get lost in exploring. A very cold spot on winter however as it's so high up so be sure to bring some hot packs! I found this spot in a music video of one of my favourite K-pop groups and decided to look into it more. Trains and subway transfers will get you to Yongma easily and from the station a taxi would only take about ten minutes, however it easily walked to as well.", December 2018
3,4.0,Creepy but Nice,"A failed theme park at a corner of a neighbourhood. The walk to the entrance could send chills down your spine.The premise is owned by a man. You will be charged 5,000KRW to enter. It has become a popular place for photoshoots. Just keep your voices down as there is a school very closeby.You can choose to take a taxi from Mangu Station. I chose to walk and observe the neighbourhood.Directions:.. Mangu Station Exit 1.. Walk straight, cross and observe the blue street signs.. Turn left at Yangmasan-Ro 115.. Keep walking. You will need to cross twice till you see Mangu-Ro 72.. Turn right and keep walking.. You will walk up a slope, pass by a temple.... Up the slope, turn left.. Yongma Land is up ahead on the right at the dead end", June 2018
4,5.0,"Not exactly abandoned anymore, but this place is a gem!","There were many people when we came. Locals mostly. That time, we were the only foreigners which was pretttyyy awesome! hahaha Took a loooot of pretty pictures when we went here. There were also a number of couples who came for their pre-nuptial shoot. If you want to take great photos while in Korea, this is definitely a place to be. The 5k won admission fee is definitely worth it. You might want to bring your best clothes for a pictorial if you come here. Tag your friends along because it's more fun with friends. ;)This place isn't for kids btw... Unless you want to have photoshoots here, then you might prepare someone to look after him/her. ;)", March 2018
5,4.0,A Great One-Time Event for Photos,"While looking at someone's blog and on Wikipedia, I did some research about Yongma Land. To keep it simple, it's a small amusement park that opened in 1980 but closed in 2011. Why did it close down? A bigger amusement park in a better location was constructed on July 12, 1989. That amusement park became known as Lotte World. While Yongma Land is in a very random area of Seoul, between Yongma Park and hiking trails, Lotte World was placed right next to Jamsil Station.Here's a little about Lotte World and its effect on Yongma Land. Two subway stations intersect each other at Jamsil Station (Lines 2 and 9) and the station itself is only a 10-minute stop from Gangnam Station. Lotte World is also half indoors and half outdoors, so it still attracts a lot of people regardless of the weather. Finally, Lotte World was placed inside a shopping complex along with Lotte Department Store. This made it a much better option than Yongma Land. Yongma Land's fan based dipped after the 1980s and never recovered after that hence it's closure.Today, the owner of Yongma Land keeps it open for a niche group of people: photographers, video producers, people into cosplay, or random amateur photographers like me that just like unique experiences. When you go there, you just have to pay W5,000 to make your way around this abandoned amusement park. Does it seem a bit creepy? It is a bit weird when you get here, but it's also very nostalgic. You can get a piece of 1970s and early 1980s Korea at this place. That's something that you can definitely take away from this place. What was my experience like? Well, I enjoyed checking it out. I walked from Manggu Station and it was a bit inconvenient trying to weave through the residential streets and finally finding Yongma Park. Then I had to start heading up a path just before seeing Yongma Land off to the right. A hiking trail was just behind it. Just trying to find this place was great for exercise, but on a humid day, I was sweating a lot. I can see why this place went out of business. The location is very bizarre, which just makes this place even more eerie. You can get interesting pictures here, but it's definitely only a one-time event for me.How to Get There: It's about a 15-minute walk from Manggu Station, but it might be easier just to take a taxi from the station. The taxi driver should know Yongma Land but if all else fails, here's the address that you can type into Naver Maps:118, Mangu-ro 70-gil, Jungnang-gu, Seoul 02180Cost: W5,000Phone Number: 010-9671-6104Estimated Time You Will Stay Here: 1-2 hours", August 2017
6,4.0,Love this abandoned park,"We made a trip to this park in the late evening hoping that the owner would still allowed us to enter.  Luckily, there were 2 wedding shootings taking place and the owner allowed us to enter (subject to payment of 5,000 won for each pax).  The park was lighted up and we were happily taking nice photos of each ride.  No worries about finding way there as long as you hail a cab from Mangu Station. Just tell the taxi driver ""Yongma Land"" and he will know :)", April 2018
7,5.0,Yongma Land is Seoul's answer to Dismaland!,"If you have a soft spot for abandoned places- Yongma Land can be the highlight of your Seoul trip. Finding your way can be tricky as the park rests on a hilly portion and is covered by a residential neighborhood. Google map helps. We boarded the bus to Yongma Park entrance and then took the rest of the way by foot. Our park visit was in the morning and when we got there, there were only two other people inside. Come prepared. Bring your powerbank (to charge your devices.) Wear comfortable shoes. And if you must be extra - bring outfit changes! The park has a well-maintained toilet to accommodate your wardrobe changes. The crowd picks up in the afternoon, and I suppose because the park provides a good vantage point for the sunset.The entrance fee is negligible. But it is good to pack snacks with you as there are no vending machines inside.", April 2018
8,4.0,A place to take good photos!,"This theme park was abandoned as you can see from the photos. I would suggest you to go earlier around 3 or 4? Cause the sun literally sets at 5 something, i mean if you wanna get great shots with natural lighting. Besides, the sunset shot is a must or even time-lapse! Unfortunately, you have to pay 5000won per person for entrance ticket, cause theres people managing the place. But brace yourself, cause the park area was quite small, but you can still find a lot of good places for photo taking!The transportation was hmmm.. inconvenience, but as I'm living in Seoul, getting there was not a problem but for travellers, you might need to really prepare everything (map) just to get there. Or you could just get a taxi (the best way). And I don't know if it can be clearly seen from the picture, but the road was quite steep and its actually hard to walk up there so i would suggest you to wear comfortably. It was definitely creepy though, at least for me.", January 2018
9,5.0,Great Abandoned theme park,"Dilapidated rides and overgrown structures perfectly set the creepy ambience I was expecting when I read about Yongma Land, loads of photo opportunities and it only costs 5000â‚© to take a look around, Awesome!", November 2017
10,4.0,A fun abandoned amusement park,"Even though it's been shut down for years and nothing runs, you can enter Yongma Land any day for 5,000 KRW (10,000 KRW for professional photography).  The rides are out of the 70s and 80s and it's fun to explore.  The owner is very nice and you can climb up and on anything as long as you aren't destroying or hurting anything.", October 2015
