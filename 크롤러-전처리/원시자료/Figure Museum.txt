3,4.0,Good for toy enthusiasts,My husband and father in law had the best time there. It’s like there’s a surprise on each floor they visited. It was properly maintained (it even smells good there haha). We went there on a Thursday and it wasn’t crowded. Easy to find via Google Maps. The toys they sold at the ground floor were a bit expensive but we bought some as souvenirs., March 2018
4,4.0,Our Mini Family Adventure in Seoul 2017,It was our 3rd family holidays in Seoul with our 5 yrs old 7 mths daughter. The figure is my husband wishlist so we went early after our breakfast via subway. It is not difficult to find and once we get out from the exit then walk few steps. It not too big but i think up to 3/ 4 level. I miss a chance to take spiderman picture ^-^, July 2017
