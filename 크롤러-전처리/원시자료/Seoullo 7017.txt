0,3.0,Don’t bother in Winter,"Really cool place but if you’re travelling in Winter I would skip it. It’s not the same, very dull to see. In summer it’ll be a better  experience for you. ", January 2020
1,4.0,It is good to see at night,I strongly recommend you to visit it at night and see another Seoul in the light. It brings a new experience. The street is good for wandering and see the vehicles and other building around., October 2019
2,4.0,A nice walk over the city,"A pleasant walk over the the hustle of the city. Markets are sometimes held as at the weekend. It has a nice view of Seoul station, especially if you want to watch the sunset over the city.  Its also nicely lit after dark. Usually a few people walking about and taking photos, but never feels to busy.", September 2019
3,5.0,A Garden in the Air,"Like the New York Highline, this old roadway has been rebirthed as an above street garden walkway. As you proceed along, the vistas open out into a wide expansive view around Seoul station. If you’re lucky someone, maybe you, will be playing one of the several upright pianos stationed along the walkway. The gardens change as you walk through a range of plant species.", October 2019
4,4.0,Nice outdoor space in an otherwise very urban city ,It’s a bit like the NY Highline except more concrete. Nice way to get between areas of the city and avoid the traffic., October 2019
5,4.0,Seoulo highline,, September 2019
6,5.0,An Airborne Oasis,"Take the walk at night.  The soft glow of the planters and occasional music along the way are good for the soul, an airborne oasis above the rush of cars and trains. During the days you may come across a player at one of the four or so pianos along the route.  And the blooms are changing every week. Even umbrellas are provided for an oppressive summer sun.  Thoughtful Korean designers at their best. Highly recommended.", July 2019
7,3.0,Overhead garden bridge,"It's an urban garden that's above the roads. You get a good view of Seoul Station (both old and new). If you're trainspotter, you can look at trains coming in and out of Seoul Station", July 2019
8,4.0,Great that Seoul followed Manhattan and converted this elevated highway section!,"The walkway is not very long but nice, with interesting trees and many pianos, plus a few interesting views.", July 2019
9,5.0,Wonderful little walk,"A quirky elevated garden built on an overpass above the busy Seoul streets. They provide free umbrellas to borrow whilst enjoying the walk and protect yourself from the sun. There are plenty of different varieties of plants, a nice area where mist is sprayed to keep cool (plants and tourists alike) and was overall a nice place to visit without crowds to bother you.", June 2019
10,4.0,"Whimsical, Botanical and No Traffic Lights","We were attracted by the lights at first, around midnight near our hotel in Seoul station. Taking those lighted stairs revealed at first a nice potted garden with each pot labeled with the latin botanical name for each plant. As we continued our walk, we found more than plants - it was a whimsical park, with working pianos, an embassy for an alien planet (where you can take official pictures behind the alien flag), trampolines, kids' drawing station, glass floors, and other rather amusing play areas - all free! Even late at night, the park felt safe - there are people walking through even after midnight. Also, the uniformed park keepers are still around late, with lighted red candlesticks in hand. This is an enjoyable place to walk, and it is most convenient when going from Seoul Station to Namdaemum or the Hoehyeon Station. Skip the traffic and take a walk in Seoullo - it will bring a smile to your heart!", June 2019
11,5.0,"Skip DDP, go here","It is probably the most beautiful walk to take in the night. The old Seoul Railway station is in lit up and so is the new one, not to mention the sky walkway. It is such a wonderful place to wander. Simply go!", June 2019

14,4.0,Passing by sightseeing,, May 2019
15,5.0,Great views and greenery in the bustling Seoul,"I just came back from Seoullo7017 - visited it on Sunday. I found it so calming and relaxing to walk around on this bridge high above the streets. It provides a leisurely walk connecting a few places. It is nicely decorated with pianos and plants adding a nice contrast to the streets around. I went during the day, but would love to come back in the evening to take some different shots. Worth a visit, for sure. Right by Seoul Station, so very easy to get to. There are stairs, as well as Ann escalator and elevators for those who with limited mobility or on wheelchairs.", April 2019
16,5.0,Fantastic view ,It’s a great opportunity to walk above the busy traffic and admire the city life in Seoul. No traffic lights at all., March 2019
17,3.0,Spring soon..,"all the plants are either leafless or covered because it still seems like winter here even though it's already end of March. but i did not regret coming here, we really can see the great effort to revitalise the city with fresh looks while letting visitors to experience the bustling city without to worry about the traffic.", March 2019

19,4.0,Calmness over the hectic korean lifestyle,, November 2018
20,4.0,Innovation the Seoul way,"Great innovation and urban revitalisation. Use it to walk quickly from Seoul Station to Namdaemun. Along the way, lots for the eye to see, including those cute tortoises that tricked me into thinking they were statues. Really quirky and one of those reasons, Seoul just keeps on giving as a growing exciting destination.", October 2018
21,5.0,Beautiful at night time,Not too long of a walk but very enjoyable! I love the setup especially the variety of trees and plants. Pack an umbrella in case it rains., October 2018
22,4.0,Pleasant place,Walked along seoullo from seoul station to Namdaemun market. Pleasant walk on seoullo looking at buildings and there’s even coffee shop along seoullo. Nice place to take a walk and enjoy seoul. Elevators are available for strollers and wheelchair, October 2018
23,4.0,Pretty walk near sunset ,"We decided to visit this park around sunset: various plantings and street pianos are scattered about, plus some tiny coffee shops and some stores. It’s about .5-6 mile ?, inspired by what NYC did in the Highline Park, which we happened to see 4 months ago.", October 2018
24,3.0,Shorter than I expected,"Seoullo 7017 was quite nice once you get up. There's an elevator or you can wind your way up the stairs and get some exercise. There's not much to see except the rail and buildings but it's a nice way to cross the road and offers a great place to sit along with all the trees and ponds up here. There's quite an evident homeless scene underneath as many older Koreans sit by Seoul station but they won't bother you. While here, walk to Lotte Mart which is nearby for an interesting experience in a Korean supermarket.", September 2018
25,2.0,Honestly not worth it,"It’s a knock off attempt at the high line, except there is no design philosophy whatsoever. No effort made to make the motifs work with each other. Just ugly cement pots with flowers on a bridge", September 2018
26,4.0,OLD ELEVATED ROAD CONVERTED INTO A PEDESTRIAN WALK WAY,, April 2018
27,5.0,Lovely at christmas,"i was living in Namdaemun so every time i would take the subway or need to do laundry i would have to cross Seoullo and it was always lovely at Christmas they decorate the park and little activity areas, there is also a cafe and lift down to exit 8 of Seoul station", November 2017
28,5.0,Great walk,"We discovered this by accident one evening when we decided to walk from Namdaemun market to Seoul station. The flowers are great and when lit up at night with the soft breeze, it is a fantastic walk with views over parts of the city.", August 2018
29,4.0,Quite nice but short,"This is a welcome walk that now allows to leisurely cross the busy station square. This elevated « green » walk is actually not that green despite the numerous plants that have been planted in concrete structures, but still much much better than anything grey and polluted below. Its was probably difficult to do much better in such environment. It is also a  good opportunity to review your botanical skills as all plants there have a label (in Korean but with Latin names). The most disappointing is the length of this walk, maybe 1 km or so, meaning that you cross it in 15 minutes.", August 2018
30,4.0,"For a different view of Seoul, visit the Seoullo 7017 'skyline'","Recently opened and featuring all manner of interactive elements in addition to great views of this ever-changing city, Seoullo 7017 is an easy journey on-foot through green spaces that have been built on an old freeway ramp. Leading the visitor from nearby the Namdaemun Market to Seoul Station (or vice-versa), the best time to visit is dusk as the park is lit-up by coloured LEDs, entire building sides are illuminated by animated video displays and the city is bathed in a golden light as the sun sets. Seoul Station offers a small number of eateries as well as discount shopping, but anticipate some homeless people waiting out the day in its shadow.", July 2018
31,5.0,The best part of Seoul!,"A must do! A long walk bridge, so uniquely done. Lovely plantations all along, colourful flowers! Steps and elevators at short distances for you to get off at various locations along the way. Equally stunning at night. Good promenade!", May 2018
32,5.0,Great for a break,"You can sign up for a free guided walking tour 3 days in advance through the official Visit Seoul website, but i found that it's perfectly satisfactory just walking and relaxing. The view is also pretty nice, you can see the moving traffic and buildings in the distance from above. There are multiple beautifully painted pianos which you can play on. All the plants have name tags including the korean and the scientific name. They are in alphabetical order and provide QR codes to access information about them.", July 2018
33,4.0,Excellent place for a pause,Go here for a relaxing walk in the city. Green and no cars. Some spots with nice view. We had a coffee break between shopping and sightseeing., November 2017

35,4.0,Atmospheric at night,, June 2018
36,5.0,An amazing experience on top of the chaos,"Visiting this space above the chaos that surrounds Seoul Station is pure magic: the nature taking over the city and the way this walk to the market and the station has been created is the perfect spot to visit, not only for architects or architecture lovers, but also to appreciate Seoul in a different way.", September 2017
37,4.0,Relaxing walkway,, April 2018
38,5.0,Very relaxing walk,I came here during the evening and was able to see the scenery at day and at night as well. This is a favourite spot for both locals and tourists as you are surrounded by well-maintained plants and on top of bustling roads that crosses Seoul Station as well. Will come here again!, April 2018

40,5.0,Seoullo 7017 Garden is Serenity in the City,"Seoullo 7017 Sky Garden is the latest landmark that has been added to the bevy of attractive tourists’ sites in Seoul City. I visited a couple of months after it's opening in 2017 and it was as serene as I could imagine.The plants and flowers were green and offered a space to relax, especially if you want to read or sip on your coffee. The views on the highways under the Sky Walkway is also amazing. There are souvenir shops and coffee shops lined on the monument. It is also easier to reach Namdaemun market and Namsan Park. The night views with all the lights are enchanting.", August 2017
41,3.0,A Unique Place in Seoul.,"Seoul 7017 is an old highway that has been converted into a walking bridge with lots of attractions and nature. Right next to Seoul Station, Seoullo 7017 is very central and provides a nice break from the constant city on all sides. However, I think that you probably can't spend more than an hour or two here.", December 2017
42,3.0,ok but overpriced,"Good idea, kinda ok execution, the plants are pretty, but it's way too short and the f&b facilities are overpriced. Just go eat at Namdaemun market if you go there!", March 2018
43,4.0,Amazing Bridge!!!,It's a very beautiful attraction place in Seoul because so many flowers and trees along the walk away. It was very relaxing to walk in this place. This place will be nice to shoot buildings and railways in Seoul, April 2017
44,4.0,take a stroll,as you can see from other reviews this attraction will not amaze you. It's the place for those that like to walk and take in the view. If you are in the mood for a  stroll it offers a nice view of  downtown Seoul and if the weather is nice can be a good spot to enjoy the sunset. We walked from the Seoul Station down to Namdaemun market., March 2018
45,2.0,Overhead Bridge,"If your country have a overhead bridge, then no point visiting this place. It is simply a decorated overhead bridge with top down city views", March 2018

48,4.0,Pedestrian bridge,, January 2018
49,3.0,New landmark ,"When Seoullo is all lit up in blue, it looks magical. Since it is facing west and high up, it can also be a good spot for sunset photo.  I was there last August when the walkway was newly opened. The city offered free walking tour in the evening. It was interesting. From Seoullo, we walked to Namsan Park and down to Namdaemun. The whole tour was about 1.5 - 2 hours.", August 2017
50,4.0,Nice Pedestrian Bridge to Walk Along,"It's a very new attraction place in Seoul. There are many trees & flowers along the walk way. you can start it around Namdaemun Market or Seoul Station. There are some connecting paths to the major buildings. If you would like to visit in the morning, please come around 07:30 or 08:00 am. If you come later, it's very hot. But if you would like to find sme coffee/ snacks/ food to eat, the shops there will open around 10:30 - 11:00 am. For me, I love to visit at night time (after 19:30 pm.)  to see some beautiful lights.", April 2017

55,5.0,Fun experience,"Rather like the Highline in New York City, this is a derelict flyover that's been converted into a modern, fun place to stroll above the city traffic. Lots of places to sit and people watch, amongst the trees, lotus ponds, shrubs and look out points. Free to wander and well worth the climb.", October 2017
56,3.0,Casual stroll for a cool night,Best done with a tour guide that you can book for free on iTour Seoul website.  The guide will give you a background as to how the pedestrian walk came about and lead you through a pleasant walk around the area.  The blue lights are nice to be caption camera.  If you're into horticulture you'll also find various plants along the way.  My highlight of the evening was chatting with our guide., October 2017
57,4.0,Better in the evening,, September 2017
58,3.0,Seoullo 7017 Review,"It is an interesting and creative idea to develop a pedestrian like this. But, in my opinion, around Seoullo 7017 needs to be developed both for visitors of the city and the citizens.", October 2017

60,5.0,Great place for a beautiful photo spot,, September 2017

62,4.0,Nice place to refreshen you up,Went today with my brother. Nice refreshing place. Spent some time there. Wish for more places like this. Enjoyed the stroll and talk there amidst the pace of this city., September 2017
63,5.0,A wonderful experience,"We love the idea of how Seoullo 7017 was revived! The flora presentation was nice. Our girls were delighted to see and hear so many cicadas and dragonflies flying around. We enjoyed our tea break at the little cafe (love their sandwiches) and towards the end of our stroll, we were serenaded by the music performers (near Seoullo Terrace). Very well maintained and clean!", August 2017
64,5.0,Walk,, August 2017
65,4.0,Almost like highline park in New York,"This park is situated on a bridge, just like highline park in New York. There was a pool where you could take a footbath, very nice when you have walked for an entire day. They also had small cafes where you could buy ice cream. Its not a park where you stay for hours but its nice to visit if you are in the neighbourhood.", July 2017
66,4.0,New place to visit in Seoul,"It was an overpass in front of Seoul station and had been transformed to a walkway for pedestrian. Easily accessed from Namdaemun market, Hoehyeon station, Seoul Station metro, the path crossed over busy streets of Seoul with hundreds kind of plants along the way. Some shops was opened too. But as in its early stage, some parts were still in repair/renovation. In overall, it was a nice short trip there.", July 2017
67,4.0,Morning Stroll at Seoullo 7017,"From our first stop which is the Seoullo Information Center up to the Seoullo Shop all the staff are very friendly and has a sunny disposition. At first Seoullo 7017 may just look like a bridge adorned with a variety of flowers and plants, but as you go about the tour you discover that it has a lot to offer. It has halls that caters to various activities such as art exhibits. It has food shops to cater to your hungry tummy like Magnolia Cafe, Rose Bingsu and Hydrangea Bread (the lemon iced tea is so refreshing). Bibimbap at 7017 Seoul Bibimbap is delicious and just like the typical Korean serving,  it is big for our small tummies. :)  We had a hard time choosing a souvenir item at the Seoullo Shop because of the many choices - pens, shirt, tote bag, mug, etc. It is recommended that you go here on an early morning or late afternoon to evening as it is too hot during our visit.", July 2017
68,3.0,My third time here ,, June 2017
69,4.0,Small is beautiful,"I especially like the different kind of roses exposed, it is quite small but it is beautiful. You can enjoy a nice walk there.", May 2017
70,5.0,It is worth walking at the time of sunset,The view of the Seoul station on the bridge was really beutiful when the sun set. I strongly recommend to walk from Namdaemun toward Seoul station in evening., June 2017
71,5.0,A newly opened walkway,"The walkway was just opened for two weeks, but it is so relaxed walking on the ex-car way. You can take the beautiful photo of the busy traffic from the bridge as well as be watching the trains getting in and out the Seoul station. more than 20000 plants are on the road but they are mostly newly planted so it may take a few years for them to grow. There are several shops and information center on the bridge and the staff wearing a green striped shirt. They are very helpful and some of them could speak several languages as the are international students studying in Seoul. The walkway is quite windy some time but also hot at noon. Some water facilities and restaurants are installed so you can cool down and take some rest. It is a good connection between the Seoul Station and the area of Myongdong.", May 2017

74,5.0,Nice spot for photo grapher,If you are photographer. This place will be nice to shoot buildings and railways in Seoul. It is also nice to after the Namdaemoon shopping traditional market., May 2017
75,2.0,Artificial park in the middle of traffic jam and surounded with car polution,"2017 May 20, Saturday was the first opening day, and I had chance to visit here. They planted trees and herbs in a cement/concrete flower pot. I wonder if it is park, the greenish park with several trees and flowers on the cement road! It was opening day but already some of small trees are dried and were going to die... brownish and yellowish leaves on them. Only one thing I can see as a good, you have quite nice views towards Seoul train station and Namdaemun gate. It was horrible the traffice jam under this ""artificial park""", May 2017
