We got some drinks, walked down toward the Han River and just picked a spot to watch people.

7,5.0,Beautiful and expansive park in the financial district,"The hangang park stretches for miles along the han river and also passes by Yeouido. The park is enormous in size actually, hard to imagine for a city short of space like Seoul. At the park is a bike trail, running trail etc and one can rent bikes. there are also cafes and restaurants, so making it the perfect destination for an afternoon outdoors. It gets very crowded on weekends however the atmosphere is great.", July 2019
8,5.0,Really lively,"I really, really want to go back and spend a lot of time here since we just take a rush stroll through this park to Cruise Tour by E-Land.

10,5.0,Fantastic place for a cheeky bike ride,"My boyfriend and I hired two shopper bikes in Yeouido park. We headed off along Mokpo bridge, along the other side of the river and back across Yanghwa bridge, then back down to the park along the under-road cycle highways. It was a fantastic experience and we really enjoyed the privacy of the cycle highways along with being able to test the outdoor gyms that were dotted along the route. The park itself is lovely apart from the hawkers...the old women shoving flyers for fried chicken in our faces...however you can avoid them once on the actual bikes. The rental was cheap and the bikes worked, that is all I can ask for.", June 2019
11,5.0,Best Place for a Walk or to Sit and Relax,"I would mainly tell people to get off at yeouinaru station, exit 1, to enjoy hangang park. It's right next to the river and has so many food trucks during the summer time. You could just grab a meal and a few beverages and sit there peacefully as long as you want. Try to go when the sun is setting so that the temperature will be cooler. This has been one of my favorite summer spots and I try to go every weekend during the summer to enjoy the area, people, and food.", June 2019
12,5.0,Best place for a sunday evening ,"❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️The place actually made me feel Happy! Made me feel peaceful , thankful and filled with emotions.

The queue for ramyeon are super long and crazy. There are also bicycle for rental which we didn't go for.The weather was really nice with the cold winds plus the sun helping to warm the place. Went on a motorised duck boat ride which it wasn't what I had imagined to be as the river was kind of not so calm that day. Only went on 2 big rounds and we surrendered.Bought a kite to fly for around 4,000 won and we really enjoyed ourselves doing so for at least an hour. Flying a kite here was really effortless without much running to get it up and flying cause the wind was really strong!

Unfortunately the bike rental places were closed despite us checking the opening hours before. With cold and grey weather we walked for a short while exploring the trails in the park but it wasn't that pleasant beacuse of the poor conditions. We spent some time watching the river before calling time and heading back to the Metro. I imagine it could be very lovely in full sun, but our experience was dissapointing.", November 2017
31,5.0,Beautiful trails!,"My cousin and I visited this park on a random day.  We didn't have anything planned in our itinerary so we walked around and saw a bike share, so we rented bikes and rode along the trails at this park.  It was so beautiful!

52,4.0,The famous Han River,"Finally set my feet on the famous Han River in my 2nd visit to Seoul. It was very crowded and cold when we were there. It was evening time and it was super crowded with lots of locals setting tents on the big patches of grass for picnics. There were food trucks along the way selling all kinds of goodies with none of the trucks that were without long queues. There were also performances by youngsters with audiences cheering for them along the river walk. There were also night market at the further end of the park where the crowd were even more packed.

54,4.0,Tandem bike anybody?,"The most popular activity to do when visiting the park is to go tandem biking. This is an activity made popular through numerous K dramas. However, it was not so easy for me and my friend- mostly because tandem biking requires synchronization between cyclists and we obviously were not in sync. However, we then requested to switch to the normal bikes and the bike rental place was extremely helpful and accommodating and allowed us to change (its KRW3000 p/h). The park is also always full on the weekend, with the locals pitching tents and laying out mats early in the evening to wait for the sunset. You can also take a cruise on the Han river for roughly KRW20,000.

We decided to come here to try the local fad - eating ramen noodles in the park.First you have to go to the very crowded convenience store to get your ramen. Next, cook your noodles. The store provides every amenity that you will need for a hot bowl of noodles. Lastly, find a spot amongst the very crowded waterfront to eat!This was a good experience to enjoy your food, people watch and seeing the world go by. However the crowds and noise will seriously turn you off.Granted, this is a public location and we came on a Saturday but it was a bit turn off.We also discovered to our amusement that there is a booth in the park.

We finished off our walk at the food court in the base of the Seoul 63 building since there aren't any places to eat on our stretch of the walk. It was quiet enough for our walk but I believe the park gets much busier in the late spring and autumn. We also went there for the International Fireworks festival and it was CRAZY busy! I imagine it will be the same in cherry blossom season..., March 2018

81,4.0,A nice walk along the Han River (Hangang),"We stayed a week in Seoul and that day we felt like getting a bit away from all the action downtown. A quick subway ride brought us to this pleasant park right at the Han River. There are lots of locals, mostly school kids and students (at least on a weekday) roaming the area and not many tourists....which isn't a bad thing.This park has quite a nice setting with some good city views and lots of space to walk, bike or relax.

It was very crowded with visitor during this time of the month, since the scenery here was really amazing & lovely and makes every photos turn out good! Unlike in Japan, they don't have snack stall or place to picnic (hanami) here, so the atmosphere is different from Japan, it more Korean styles of enjoying the cherry blossom.

One thing for sure, we have always enjoyed our trip there. I always have my annual winter vsit to this park just to give myself a short break fro the crazy schedule. It is always quite empty during winter so it feels like I have the park to myself. Watching the sunset while having a cup of coffee in a cafe which faces the river is perfect. During fall and spring, picnic is something not uncommon especially among locals. Go for a bike ride or just sit down and enjoy your time with family and friends. Either way it will be a fun day for you. I always avoid going to the cherry blossom festivals because it will be too packed with people. Instead I would suggest going several days earlier or well a day or two earlier would be fine too as most trees will be blooming by then and it won't be as pack as during the festival period. Sometimes, there are also performances at the main park area. So just sit back, relax and enjoy the scenery and time with your loved ones.", December 2015

I didn't see any other foreigner whilst I was in Yeouido and I think several people were surprised to see me there.Yeouido itself has many tall buildings with lots of glass fronting. The style of the buildings is very western and far away from traditional korean architecture. There's also the parliament building there with many protests happening on a daily basis. I saw at least 4 police coaches whilst I was there and as I passed they were deploying towards the protests. The park is absolutely beautiful and much needed there. It was thriving with people taking part in some sort of game show, as well as office workers and elderly people getting excercise.There's a large soft track that spands the outskirt of the park and several toilet facilities. In the centre of the park there's an astro-turf/basketball area with plane statue. There's also a nature reserve with a small stream and wooden paths you can walk along so you don't distrurb the animals. I only saw many plants and some birds but it was so quiet and serene. I was surprised that they'd made wheelchair access to the paths with areas along the path to move a wheelchair into should the user need a rest.", September 2015
167,3.0,A nice enough park... but you didn't travel all the way to Korea for a park did you?,"If you've come all this way to Korea you'll want to find yourself something else to do because, as lovely as Yeouido Hangang Park may be, it doesn't deviate far from other average parks around the world. If you're a local looking for a relaxing time then by all means this park is more than decent. However, the disappointment of the city skyline - or a lack thereof - and you've got yourself a park that doesn't prove to be a good visit for tourists.", December 2014
168,5.0,Lovely Park for Relaxation,We took a stroll through the park and it was very relaxing. There was plenty of space with people enjoying different activities from cycling to exercising. I wish we had parks like these in the United States, October 2015
169,4.0,Very relaxing and suitable to have a picnic there,"regardless it's day time or night time, Koreans love to chill by the Hangang! It was comfortable and plenty of space to sit and relax, talk or even picnic. It's beautiful but you can try to search if there are any activities in the area otherwise it can be a little boring.", October 2015
170,5.0,Easy stroll by the Hangang banks,"Looking for a riverside stroll / The Yeuido hanggang park is a good option, as the =Hanggang river banks is filled with parks to stroll on , bike around , lounge around , picnic in. I like this particular park specially in spring during Cherry blossoms ! Just perfect !", September 2015
171,4.0,Nice setting to have a picnic or ride a bike.,You can easily spend a few hours walking along the Han river or hire a bike for a few hours and do a loop of the track :), September 2015
172,5.0,Enjoyable place especially before 6 p.m.,"This park is so famous with beautiful view. I like to walk or take a bicycle in this park especially before 6 p.m. because sometimes it is crowded after 6 p.m. But mostly this place is so quiet and enjoyable before 6 p.m. Several years ago, Seoul city reconstructed this park and after that, this place is so clean and nice to walk(You can rent bicycles at some places). It has many convenience stores, cafes and restaurants(mostly fried chicken and beer) but this place is huge so in not famous part, maybe you have to walk to find those. Seoul citizens like this place and I recommend this place for visitors, too.", September 2015
173,4.0,Must visit during Cherry Blossom season,"I just so happen to be in the area during the cherry blossom season and it was beautiful. I also went back a little after the fact throughout my time in Seoul. Its a great place to ride your bike or go for a jog. If you are dating someone, you need to take them during the cherry blossom season. You just might get lucky, lol.", March 2015
174,5.0,Great for walking or biking around. ,"This park is located on the south side of the Hangang river. It is a well maintained park with some kiosks for buying drinks or snacks. You can also opt for renting a bike at the park. Bikes are relatively small, but they work well in general. There's a biking trail in the park. But you can also leave the park and bike along the river Hangang. If you like biking and are a confident biker, this is what you should do in my opinion!There you'll find a nice walking and biking trail along the river. It's a great way to do some exercise and enjoy the views along the river. There are several resting areas and kiosks around. It can get very busy in the weekend. Enjoy!", September 2015
175,4.0,Great Park,"Extremely crowded place, but still you can enjoy. Hiking, riding a bike, and picnic are available, and you can drink some alcohol too.", January 2015
176,5.0,Create another Seoul memory by cycling along Hangang river bank,The open park along the river would bring join to anyone in your family. Me & my daughter spent whole morning here as we rent 2 bikes (with helmets) & cycled along the river. The rental fee was very reasonable & you can see most of Yeouido landscape from the river bank., September 2014
177,3.0,Expansive views of the Han River but not much else,"Hangang Park was constructed on reclaimed land on the shores of the Han River and is easily accessed on Metro line 5 from Yeouinaru station.  Compared to the leafier and more scenic Yeouido Park nearby, Hangang Park is rather sparse with open grassy sections and long walking paths.  Trees, where present, are fairly few and far apart.  However, this layout gives the park unlimited views of the Han River.  It's popular for walks and with skateboarders who come to practice their flips and tricks.  Another reason to come here is that the pier for the Han River sightseeing ferries are located about 300-400 meters away from the Meto station.", October 2014
178,4.0,Han River views make it worth the trip,"There's not much to see in Yeouido Hangang Park itself; it's the view of Yeouido Tower and above all of the Han River that makes a visit to the park worthwhile; that, and the Han River cruise that you can embark on from the edge of the park. On a sunny summer evening, this could be the perfect place for a little picnic, if it's not too hot and humid (as is all too often the case in Seoul). The only tricky thing is transportation, as you have to take a bus or a taxicab to and from the park, since there is no nearby subway station.", June 2015
179,5.0,My favorite place to be in Seoul.,"Yeouido Hangang Park is just like Battery Park in New York. It is close to the central business district (Yeouido has its own Wall Street nearby) and it has: nice breezes, green grass, perfect sunset, and lots of photo-ops!", May 2015
180,5.0,Beautiful and user-friendly,"The park goes all the way around the island.  I live in another part of the city, but I sometimes take a bus to Yeouido just to go for a walk here.  There are places along the way where the greenery closes above you.  The views across the water are also great.", August 2015
181,4.0,Beautiful Park,"Greeted by flyers of fried chicken once we came out from the Yeouido subway station. But the fried chickens had to be order through phone calls and we couldnt speak Korean. Luckily there was a Korean guy offered help to call, but we had to wait for 40 minutes for the delivery. (Alright I shall stop the Fried chicken story)We took the cruise at 9pm, 9600 won after discount, and it took about 30 minutes, where you could enjoy night scenery along the Han river, had a close look at the bridges beneath them. Enjoyed the night cruise. It's a soothing one. There might have little concerts and people would throw their support there. Quite a happening park but does not lose its serenity. Can ride a bike or do picnics there, just like the locals do! A wonderful place for picnic yeah!", August 2015
182,4.0,Beautiful Park in the Financial District,"This is a lovely park with nice paths, small ponds and lots of grassy space.  It is also near the Hangong River.  I found it very safe to walk,alone, even after dark.  There were many people walking and even picnicking in the evening.", August 2015
183,3.0,Check out what festivals are happening.,"While the park is awesome when there are activities or festivals (fairly frequent) going on, its not worth a special trip if you're visiting Seoul.", August 2015
184,3.0,Normal Park,"It was a normal park in the middle of the city area, but maybe a good place to view cherry blossom in full bloom", April 2015
185,4.0,not much,the garden of yeouido at hangang park is not as pretty as at yeouido park. I think better you visit the Yeouido garden than hangang park except you want to get a boat  tour., May 2015
186,4.0,A small but nice park,This place is great for having a picnic and it's conveniently located near the IFC Mall! You can ride your bike along the bike paths or play basketball as well! The plants and flowers are well taken care of too., July 2015
187,4.0,Beautiful park on the Han River,"The entire Yeouido Park area is just a great place to rest, relax and meditate.  It is in the shape of a T.  Yeouido Park is the stem of the T, and the Hangam Park area runs along the water.  Lots of native trees, grass and plants and flowers.  Walking, biking trails, benches and tranquil view of the Han River.  Take the metro, line 5, purple and when you exit the park is right in front of you.  Hopefully if you are visiting and have the time between sightseeing and shopping, this is a great respite from the hectic Seoul.", June 2015
188,2.0,No sakura,"Went there at april to see sakuraThere nothing thereOnly a few tree with a little sakura thereDont go there if u want to see some cherry blossom treeOther than that, i think around april there always a festival there", July 2015
189,4.0,Cherry Blossom Time,"Visited the park and the surrounding area in April, cherry blossom time and found it to be a great place for a relaxing time. . . Like most of the other parks in seoul , this one is also nice and safe. The line of flowers during the festival made it a treat to watch .A 5 min walk from the nearest subway station.", April 2015
190,4.0,A great park for bike riding or picnics...,This is an area that has some really good views with the cherry blossom trees and its a park and clean and nice and you have to make it something good by making a picnic out of it or making it special by riding a bike... Its worth seeing and doing but there are alot of people in this area during cherry blossom season and also weekends. This a great place for families and for couples., April 2015
191,4.0,A pleasant walk through natural beauty of Korea,"The weather was gloomy, but did not effect the great time I had there.  Very clean and safe, a fun visit if you have a few hours to enjoy seeing the natural beauty of Korea.", March 2015
192,4.0,It's a park,"Like most of Seoul Tourist stuff, it's clean and high quality. It's nothing spectacular, because it's a park. It's just very good at what it does. Good for picnics, good for hanging out, good for the sun, for dog walking, relaxing. Spacious, and i'm pretty sure there's free access to wifi across most of it.", June 2015
193,5.0,"take a break, cycling","another landmark of seoul, very beautiful and many korean are here. this is a very good place for relaxing, exercise, cycling and picnic. rent a biscycle is around 3000 krw per hour.", April 2015
194,4.0,Great for bike riding and picnics,"If you want somewhere pleasant and outdoors to hang out for a picnic in Seoul, this is a great place, particularly in the humid summer, when you'll appreciate the open space and the chance of a breeze. The Han is an impressively wide river, and is framed by the skyscrapers of Yeouido. There's a wide grassy area between the street and the river, so plenty of space to throw down a blanket, pop an bottle of wine, and chill out in the sun. Hangang park extends for miles in each direction, and is pretty much one giant cycle path, so if you have a bike, this is a great place to get exercise in peace and safety, without having to tackle the potential nightmare of cycling on the roads of central Seoul.", June 2015
195,5.0,Ride a bike!,Riding along the Han is one of my favourite things to do in Korea. Rent a bike and go exploring. Order some pizza or chicken and have it delivered to you at the park while you watch the water display at Banpo Bridge or a show on the floating stage., August 2014
196,5.0,Superb park where the old meets the new...so peaceful and tranquil,"Trees in blossom, very neat and tidy. Some superb traditional wooden structures, layout and information in both Korean and English. Nothing to dislike", April 2015
197,5.0,It's Spring!! Great Park for Chilling~,Has been knowing this park from Running Man and wanting to come here for a look. Luckily the time of my visit was during spring. Slightly sunny day and windy. Should have bring some snacks along to have a mini picnic with my deary friend. This park is ideal for outdoor activities. Saw some people setting up tent on the park. How I wish I can do that too!!! like overnight in the middle of the park and the weather/environment is chilling. cooool~, May 2015
198,4.0,A park for all,Truly an ideal park for outdoor activity. Bringing families and friends are advised especially on weekends/holiday. A special bike track or skateboard and the like is available. Restaurants/cafes are also within walking distance. The view to any directions is fantastic., May 2015
199,5.0,Go For a Walk/Cycling/Picnic/Admire Gangbuk from This Beautiful Park.,"I walked to this park from Yeouido Park - and was impressed by the size of this park. Overlooking Hangang, you can go for a stroll, rent a bicycle, have a picnic, or simply sit anywhere in the park to admire the gorgeous city view and Gangbuk from this side of the city. With a good weather, I can only imagine how lovely it would be walking from one end to the other in this park at night - that will be in my list during my next visit for sure! :)It's near to subway stations (Yeouinaru and Yeouido stations), cafes, stalls. Super clean.", May 2015

205,5.0,Pretty Cherry Blossoms,"We are so fortunate that the cherry flowers waited for us :) The pretty numerous flowers from the strip of many cherry blossoms trees welcome us, telling us enjoy and take a lot of pictures until you can :) The lights which added shimmer to the cherry flowers made it more magnificent and captivating.", April 2015

207,5.0,Cherry Blossoms,Went here to catch the cherry blossoms and it definitely did not disappoint. A good place to spend the afternoon by the Hangang River. Yeouinaru Station on Line 5 Exit 1., April 2015
208,5.0,Sakura is amazing,what a amazing view of Sakura of Yeouido Hangang Park. I went there on week day. So not that many people there that I could take many many photos with my wife. It's cold out there because that park is located beside the Hangang river. Be careful of getting cold when you get there., April 2015
209,4.0,Nice for walking and running,We were fortunate to have stayed in Yeouido so we were able to get there on foot and run along the path beside the Hangang River.  We went for early morning runs so the path wasn't crowded at all.  The park is very well maintained., April 2015
210,4.0,Peaceful and nice view,"It's very peaceful park. Super big that your legs get tired walking around. There is bicycle for rent (I think it's for rent, didn't go to ask for the fee and condition). The han river is very nice, it's quite chill and windy, so make sure you wear long-sleeve shirts or sweater (I was there in April)", April 2015
211,4.0,Eco-lung in Seoul,"Although rather concrete, there is quite a lot of grass and trees (especially good in flowering season) where you can wander in relative tranquility.", April 2015
212,5.0,Beautiful Park,Long lanes to walk/Bike thru to see all the different areas of the park. A great place to bring a blanket and enjoy some sun on a patch of grass or a picnic with a S/O. Has areas to play basket ball or hold a stage for live music and a festival. I happened to be there on April 12th and it was the first day of the Cherry blossom festival., April 2015
213,5.0,Excellent for unwinding,"Excellent grounds for walking, running, cycling, picnicking or simply to chill. About 2+km circuit around the park. There are also mini parks within. Cherry blossoms were starting to come up. Have an icecream, coffee, redbean fish cake - it's all good.", April 2015

215,3.0,Beautiful blossoms,Probably the most well-known place to see cherry blossoms in the spring in Korea; not sure if it's the best.  Crowds are overbearing as all of Seoul comes there within those couple weeks.  Other than that there is nothing special about the park., April 2015

217,4.0,good place to relax,"This was a great park to relax. Very spacious and clean, with the Han river right in front of you. It was pretty warm when we went, and around lunch time. We saw a lot of office workers, (maybe?) in their suits walking around. Right across the street is the Yeouido Park were many walk for a little exercise during their lunch break. I didnt know if it was fog or smog, but it was pretty foggy when we were there even though the sun was high. Yeouinaru Station exit 2 or 3 will get you to the Yeouido Hangang Park.", March 2015
218,4.0,Good place for picnic,"If you have visited all the major tourist attractions in Seoul and wonder what else you can do, you can visit this park and rent a bicycle to cycle around the park. The Yeouido park is linked to Hangang park. We did not have a picnic there but saw many groups of people sitting on the grass and just enjoying the breeze. KBS station is nearby so if you are a fan of Korean varieties show or drama, you can walk to the station for some photos. The radio station has a glass window and the studio is visible from the outside on the ground floor. If you are lucky, you may spot some Kpop stars.", March 2015
219,4.0,"Mediocre food, cool breeze.","If you are not looking for great quality food, you can eat at one of the food court at the park. Otherwise, I recommend to bring your own food or get something instant from convenient stores.", December 2014
220,5.0,"Chill, cycle","This is a place to chill at night, sunset is beautiful, you can picnic with loved ones, have dinner on one of the boat cruises, enjoy street performances! Best of all, rent a bike and cycle along the Hangang with the locals. Bike rental is affordable and the bikes are very new and comfortable to cycle on! One thing to remember is the river is quite long, so if you would like to complete the entire cycling route, you might want to rent the bike for one whole day, or at least 4 hours (which is still rather inexpensive), considering that you would need time to travel back to the rental shop.If you get lost, the good news is that bikes are allowed onto metros, you can easily find the nearest metro station and take the metro back to the Yeouido station, which is only a few minutes away from the rental shop. Bring a photo ID along, you'll need to deposit it with the rental shop and will get it back when you return the bike.PS couples, young families and friends will definitely enjoy picnics here", October 2014
221,5.0,It's beyond description.,"A lovely park with gorgeous scenery. The park itself is clean and spacious. It's a great place for gathering, resting, relaxing or perhaps everything! There is a huge water pool and a fountain in the middle of the park, and everyone is welcome to have fun in the water. It's just amazing. A stroll along the park not only brought you the beautiful scenery of Han River but also the picture of how it's like to live in Seoul. It's just so vibrant and lovely. Do visit the park in the evening and come back at nighttime as well. The sunset and the night scene are just amazing. I will certainly come back when i visit Seoul again.", September 2014
222,5.0,Beyond beautiful,"I went in May period where the weather was a decent 25-30 degree celcius range and my gosh does it make for an amazing experience! Yeouido Park isn't just simply some nice green with couples, friends and family sprawled out all across the bank (many who bring portable BBQs and tents to shield their pale skin even more from the sun ;)), it's also filled with bicycle rentals for you to enjoy a large portion of the river (bikes for solos and also 'couple' bikes hehe - seoul is renowned for their strong 'couple' culture), there's a man-made pool in the middle of it all with interesting architecture all around. Must go during the day and at night! I witnessed a proposal as well! So there's always plenty going on including buskers, food stalls and much more! Make this a destination!", May 2014
223,5.0,Let's Go Fly A Kite!,"Kites are everywhere in the springtime and summer. The park is extremely close the 63 building. It is always teeming with people. Perfect during the cherry blossom season, but also quite crowded. I loved taking a blanket and picnic basket and simply spending the day out by the river. You can also rent bikes there. And it was also nice to see families spending time together since everyone works so hard in Seoul.", September 2013
224,4.0,Great place to see the Cherry Blossoms,"Both times I went was during the Cherry Blossom period (Apr) so the whole stretch was filled with blooming flowers with festival celebrating the coming of Spring.

225,5.0,I go every time when in Seoul,"When it comes to Seoul, I'm usually all just about food and shopping, but my Korean friend took me here one time (soooo close to the subway station, literally, you walk out and you're there), and from then on every time I'm back in Seoul I HAVE to come back here.On weekends (not sure about weekdays), they usually have these young musicians / singers playing music right down the stairs by the Han river, and there are loads of young people hanging out there... The atmosphere is just awesome, especially if you're there to watch the sunset.Another time I went at midnight - Seoul is like super safe, that night we saw 4 different police vehicles and similar objects driving before us every 3 minutes, I genuinely thought they were having an outing that night or sth :P - got fried chicken and beer (totally korean style), and it was still a great hangout place even though there weren't that many people.If any doubts, seriously, just go, you won't regret it, worst comes to worst, just go back into the subway station which is like 30-90 seconds away depending on how quickly you walk :P", November 2013
226,4.0,Cherry Blossoms!,Great timing as the Cherry Blossoms were in full bloom at the time of our visit. There are picnic areas all over the park and the view of the water is great. Take Line 5 (purple line) and get off at  Yeouinaru., April 2014
227,4.0,"A nice place to ride a bike, though a bit crowded.","This is a lovely place for a bike ride, and there are plenty of rental bikes -- cruisers, mountain bikes, tandems, and kids bikes.  It's nice that it has decent bathroom facilities every so often to stop at also.  Two things to note:1.  I'm 5'10"", and it turns out most of their cruiser bikes were really too small for me to ride comfortably.  The frames seemed small and their seatposts were too short to safely extend as high as I would need.  I ended up paying the extra 2K won per hour to rent a mountain bike which fit much better, but it was totally worth it for a more comfortable fit.2.  The paths were quite busy with riders and walkers when we visited on a Sunday, with riders of all levels and speeds -- from young couples flirting and weaving slowly on tandems to riders in full road racing kit (oddly, most on high-end mountain bikes) riding a little aggressively.  So, small children will need active supervision or be on the back of a tandem bike.Overall, a nice bike ride by the Han river with lovely flowering trees.", March 2014
