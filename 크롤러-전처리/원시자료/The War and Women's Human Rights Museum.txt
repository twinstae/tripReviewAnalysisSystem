2,4.0,Powerfully important museum,"Tucked away in a little neighborhood, this museum is a small, intimate experience of a terrible chapter in the history of World War II. The English audio guide walks visitors through the little building, where art, personal stories, and artifacts tell the painful stories of “comfort women,” sex slaves who served the Imperial Japanese Army after being abducted and forced into service. A ‘must see’ destination to understand how widespread violence against women was a historical reality that has yet to end. Stories of sexual violence that continues today in other parts of the world are also reflected in an included exhibit. Appropriate for youth ages 13 and older (many of the sex slaves were younger at the time of their kidnapping). I was glad to see both young women and men taking their time to thoughtfully proceed through the museum.", May 2019
