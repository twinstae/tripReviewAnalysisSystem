0,4.0,Beautiful architecture,"It definitely stands out architecturally as it aims to be the future of Korea. As the old building has a classic design, this new building is so looking so modern and beautiful. Worth a visit.", October 2019

2,5.0,Just WOW - In Utter Awe with the Architecture at this Place.,"Without a doubt this is a MUST SEE. The pictures we are showing here were a kind donation from the IARC Architects (the actual group that designed and made this amazing piece of Art).The building is absolutely gorgeous filled with outstanding materials, curves, bubbles, inner gardens and from the outside, although great and beautiful, does not represent the full impact that you receive whilst in the inside.As explained to us.... This place wants to be a future architecture that goes with the culture and terrain of the new Seoul citizens’ cultural emotion. And apparently the design of this building is based or inspired on mountains and valleys. Inspired on nature basically.As some of you may or may not know, the Seoul square is a symbolical center of Seoul and the only existing outside public space. As described; the concept design is a vertical extension of the Seoul square. The cultural facilities in this building are literally hanging. The Multi-level hanging terraces are linking to its culture facilities. Inside the stairs and the curved handling rods, that seem not to make any sense (it does). Inner wall attached and hanging gardens bring color, nature and live to this place.All in all we highly recommend this place as a true shocking piece of modernistic and sustainable architecture. The place is very spacious, it has a library also and a coffee shop available at the bottom of the place. Please come and enjoy the amazing Seoul City Hall.Special thanks to IARC Architects for the outstanding images (a lot better than ours).", January 2020
3,4.0,Stands out architecturally,"I recently visited the City Hall and fell in love with its design and architecture. This modern build stands out drastically and you can easily spot it due to its architectural design. I took the elevator to the top floor and hung out at the cafe. The drinks and desserts are priced really low as compared to other cafes- yet they are fresh and tasty. I was a bit confused as to which floor is open to the public and tried getting off at various floors but the evaluator only goes to the top floor, and perhaps the other floors can only be accessed by the workers through other elevators. The basement floor is quite huge and offered a wide range of sitting areas as well as shops, archeological museum and others. Right in front of the City Hall lies the moon shaped ice rink which is open during the winter season. All in all, it was an interesting visit.", January 2020
4,4.0,Amazing spot to travel to,"Pretty view, historical place, it's very near to a palace. Visited during the Autumn season, it is cooling and it rained. Recommend to bring an umbrella when visiting as there is not much shelter.", October 2019

6,3.0,City Hall With History,The older and original City Hall was built during the Japanese Occupation in 1925 and served until liberation in 1945.The more modern building to one side was built in 2008. Both are interesting buildings in the heart of Seoul., September 2019
7,3.0,Odd architecture,"This is a glass building behind the old city hall.It looks expensive. But, I don't get much architectural beauty.There's a public zone in the basement floor. It's good to visit for an hour.", August 2019
8,4.0,Interesting building,"Seoul City Hall is not an attraction in its own right, although the architecture is very interesting. It resembles a large glass tsunami. It makes an interesting side visit along with Seoul Plaza and Seoul Metropolitan Library (the old city Hall), whilst visiting the nearby Deoksugung Palace.", July 2019
9,4.0,Old and new city halls,"Apparently, there are 2 City halls, the new and old. The old city hall is now a Seoul Metropolitan Library while the new city hall, which is next to it, is a modern impressive architecture. They are located in front of the Seoul Plaza, a large open space field. I passed by here on my way to Deoksugung Palace.", June 2019
10,3.0,Not a required visit,"The new Seoul City Hall is, indeed, an interesting architectural structure -- but if one's time is short when visiting Seoul, a visit inside is not required.", June 2019
11,5.0,Great architecture,We did not get a chance to go there for long but our hotel was right next to the City Hall square so we passed by quiet often. The buildings are impressive and we liked the vibe overall. Definitely worth a stop - esp when there are performances, May 2019
12,3.0,Photostop only,We went here because it is very close with our hotel at myeongdong area. We went here after visit Deoksugung palace. Just for photostop., December 2018
13,4.0,Impressive modern architecutre,"The original Seoul City hall became the Seoul Metropolitan Library and behind it stands the new city hall which is a very exciting and impressive modern building made of glass and steel and where the Seoul Metropolitan Government is based. The new building was completed and opened in 2012 and is a stone's throw from several well known landmarks such as the Lotte Duty Free building, the Grevin Museum and the Plaza Hotel.", July 2018
14,4.0,Seoul's Modern Architectural showpiece,"Seoul has two City Halls, one old and the other new. The Old City hall which was supposed to be built in 1900s has been now converted into a Library. The new one was open in in 2012 and houses most of the government offices along with other Multipurpose halls and cultural centers including Cafes. The new City hall is a multi storied building with glass façade impressing one and all. Visit to this place can be clubbed along with Deoksgung Palace.This place is in a walkable distance from the City Hall Subway Station.", May 2018
15,4.0,An interesting modern public building,"A new ultra-modern city hall has been built and opened in just the past 5-6 years, and is located behind the older original (and Japanese-designed) City Hall. The older City Hall has now been converted into a library.The new City Hall is located behind, and slightly to the right of, the earlier building, and its sweeping facade appears to curve upwards and almost leaning over the much smaller and earlier building. This IS an impressive building, both from the outside, as well as its interiors, which include a gigantic main wall of glass right across the front of the building, and an internal greenery wall of plants that seems to soar ever so high up above you. In front of the two City Halls (the old and the new...) is the huge City Hall Plaza. This open space seems to be used for a variety of public events, outdoor exhibitions, food expos etc. There was a seafoods suppliers exhibition being held at one edge of the large plaza on the day we visited, which gave us an opportunity to sample a couple of seafood plates.Well worth a visit, and do ENSURE that you don't just view the new City Hall from the outside, but DO go inside and take in the impressive architecture of this building.You could probably spend upwards of an hour checking out the plaza and new City Hall, but if there is an interesting event being held on the plaza then you might find you can spend much longer there.", November 2018
16,3.0,Don't miss the stone wall in autumn,"The City Hall, just a short walk from the City Hall metro station, is a beautiful building. However, I would like to mention that in autumn, please do not miss the stone wall adjacent to Exit 1 of the station. It is a scenic spot for portrait photography.", November 2018
17,5.0,Fascinating Modern Building,"As an architecture buff, I found Seoul's City Hall to be a most worthwhile stop. The modern 13-story glass-and-steel building opened in 2012 behind the old, stone city hall, now a library. Designed by You Kerl, the new building resembles a huge wave but borrows from elements of traditional Korean houses, such as the roof structure. Eco friendly, its features include a geothermal plant and rainwater for the cooling system.Home for city government offices, the building also welcomes the general public for free in many areas. I started on the first floor and marveled at the vertical garden that climbs the inner wall to the seventh floor. Consisting of tens of thousands of plants, the garden was the largest in the world when the building opened. Its lower part, which I could see clearly, however, needs to have brown leaves removed. An art installation, ""Metaseosa Seobeol,"" appears just inside the entrance by the garden. Its myriad white balloons represent Seoul's turbulent history, but the creation reminded me of giant grapes. I took the glass elevator to the ninth-floor cafe, where artwork was displayed. Many people sat at small tables, drinking coffee or looking at phones. Two locals invited me to join them and shared many interesting stories about their city and its history.Later, I descended to the basement level's multipurpose space, which includes art exhibitions and design shops. I especially liked the glassed-in archaeology hall that exhibits items from the Joseon dynasty found during excavation of the site. A visitor information desk at this level had an English-speaking woman, who gave me details about the area in general. Seoul City Hall offers a convenient stop for those visiting nearby Deoksugung Palace. The building is at the City Hall metro stop.", October 2018
18,4.0,"Modern, impressive looking building - colourful at night","The original Seoul City Hall, built in 1925 is an example of Imperial Crown Style architecture and served as city hall until 2008. It is now the Seoul Metropolitan Library. It is completely overshadowed by the imposing new City Hall which is often described as looking like a tsunami made of glass and steel. I was staying at the Plaza hotel just across the square so I saw it both by day and by night in all its glory. And at night it was very colourful indeed, changing colours what appeared to be every few minutes. And by day it seemed to attract all sorts of protesters making noisy demonstrations about a range of mainly local issues. In fact in the week I stayed in this city one gets a very strong impression that Koreans like to shout, wave banners and generally make a lot of noise. Thank goodness that my hotel room had good sound protection. By the way, in the basement of the City Hall are a number of nice exhibitions, some of which I could vaguely understand...", October 2018
19,5.0,One of key attractions of Seoul,"This transparent building, resembling a tidal wave, is one of most disputed constructions in Seoul, as it does not blend in with the original city hall building (located in the front, now a library). But still, it is a cool building to take a look at.", October 2018
20,5.0,Check out the City Hall Basement floors,"This wasn't on our planned itinerary, and it turned out to be a surprisingly pleasant experience! It was around 6 PM on a weekday, and we had gone in and taken pictures of the vertical gardens, and this glowing light structure. On our way out, one of the senior guards motioned us to the elevator, and told a passing local to escort us to the basement. Upon exiting the elevator, we went out to this floor where photo ops abound! Take a picture with different wall colors, pretend to be ""On Air"" at a studio, look for the ""Lego Wall,"" admire the pastel image-covered lights, and go through a relics exhibit hall! We were only able to explore one floor, but there seems to be two floors of this ""Citizens' Hall."" Wish they promoted this more!", July 2018

25,4.0,An impressive building !,"The Seoul City Hall was just a 5-10 minute walk from my hotel. I walked by it several times, but never stopped in. Unfortunately, today is a Monday and most tourist attractionsare closed in Seoul on Mondays and so was the visit of the City Hall. Hence, I could only see the lobby area and got my self some documentation. The 'Tong Tong Tour', a Self- Guided Tour, looks very interesting to me. It goes over most floors of the City Hall. I will certainly do this during my next visit!", May 2018
26,3.0,You either love it or hate it.   I didn’t love it.,"Very unusual curved glass design.    I didn’t care for it at all.  Not from any direction.   The smaller former city hall, now a library, is immediately in front of the new City Hall,    There is a large grassy area in front which is used as an ice rink in the winter.    You can also take a picture sitting on, or in front of, the S E O U L lettered sculpture, facing the City Hall.     2 Metro stops 1 block away.", May 2018
27,4.0,Impressive architecture,It’s worth taking a detour to walk past the new City Hall.  Which stands imposingly behind the old much smaller city hall.The architecture is extremely impressive and the curves are spectacular!Not much to do there apart from admire the building!, April 2018

29,5.0,Sightseeing ,For the first timer travel to this city.. Starting from the first landing at Incheon... Clearing an immigration and custom.. Quite a procedural SOP which have to fulfil as most typical traveler like Asian kind.. Where have to take some of the groceries from local produce as a typical traveller would not survive with the food at the countries which they landed..some strict rules of food preparation by the landed state... Where it may prohibited to take them. No other way.. Bring some of the local ingredients and bring along some.. And declare at the customs what have you brought in.. List them.. And you are allowed to get in.. Accept for the past 2 visit.. Sydney and Auckland.. Where Auckland seek to see what you have brought in.. Go one by one... Seoul.. Know your culture well and the procedure seem look efficient... but unfortunately the counter for KAL Limousine to get to City Hall was close at 9.30 pm... My clearing at the airport at 10.39 pm.. having no choice.. Get a International Taxi... 65000 won at Region 2 of your destination.. Right in front of your lobby..Moving around City Hall.. advisable to move around with subway.. Get a T Money and load the amount of your required amount as the local at 7~11 suggested put a value of 10000 won for your usage as long as 3 days.. And also.. How often you move from one region to one region... Subway makes your mobility at Seoul.. Efficiently and do not hesitate to open your soft spoken skill to ask the station worker.. If you look lost...., April 2018

31,5.0,Futurism meets nature: architectural delight,I am a huge sci fi and futurism fan and loved this building and architecture. It could be out of an Interstellar-esque space station. Despite it being very cold outside the inside feels like a warm garden. The lush plants and clean crisp architectural lines make this a photographer's paradise. Take the glass lift up to the platform where the coffee shop is to get an excellent view.Stunning and a must visit for architecture and sci fi fans. However note the art gallery supposedly on floor 7 appears currently defunct/neglected., January 2018

35,4.0,Architecturally pleasing,"Seoul City Hall is an amazing building that is architecturally a marvel to look at. Seoul City Hall was built in 1926. There is an open green area by the City Hall. Various events and festivals are held here. It is also a nice place to have a picnic. The Seoul Plaza is a very significant historic site. It is also serves as a gathering place for football fans – as was the case during the 2002 World Cup that was jointly held by Japan and S. Korea. There is a monument with a clock counting down to the winter Olympics of 2018 in Pyeong Chang.  One of the attractions of Seoul Plaza is the Floor Water Fountain, which looks like a normal sidewalk but shoots water up very high from the floor when you walk across it. The 48 floor lights along the grass square and Fala- a round type outer wall clock- are other attractive features of the Square. The Fala, in particular, is designed to ring the Boshingak Belfry sound at high noon everyday. The Floor Water Fountain presents a grand sight with 35 underwater lights.Admission is free", August 2017

37,4.0,Modern City Hall,it is a bit surprising to see the glass building of the new city hall behind the old city hall at Seoul Plaza. Last time I visited Seoul it didn't exist.

But there is Deoksugung Palce and related park.  Seoul Museum of Art is nearby., October 2017

What's unique about this place is that the old building has been converted into a world-class public library, and that a brand new architectural building is being built adjacent to it.  At one stage, it has the world's tallest vertical garden but it still looks rather impressive.  There's a visitor's lift that takes you to the 8th floor where temporary art presentations are being held from time to time, and that you can walk up the stairs to the ninth floor, where there's a café, and where you can have coffee meetings with your colleagues overlooking the city of Seoul.  At the basement of the new City Hall is a small public stage free performance is being held there from time to time.  Overall, there's a sense of blandness about it.  Still, if you haven't been to Seoul before, you might want to see this for yourself.  Outside the Hall is a large field where a lot of huge of demonstrations are being held.", January 2017

It can be annoying for traffic or some noise. Koreans are use to it. But I don't know about the visitors. It's a beautiful place of Seoul, the heart of Seoul, but also a place to avoid at times.

So after our breakfast at our hotel, we embarked on a walking trail.As we walked along the streets, we were amazed by the different buildings here in unique designs and architectural themes we encountered and the greenery lanes that the city hall has to offer, a good segregation between commercialization and nature that impressed us. It's so relaxing and soothing to be able to be near to ""mother nature"" in a busy, crowded bustling city! It's a good place to experience Seoul and immerse in it.If not of the limited time we had, we would love to walk and see more here.

The City Hall is actually built on what used to be the palace grounds. I found this an enjoyable place to stroll early in the morning and listen to the sounds of Seoul waking up.

The old building is now used as a public library. The new building houses the Largest Vertical Garden in the world (as recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records). When we were there we were also able to enjoy a relic museum and a free janggu show at the basement. During winter, outside the City Hall is an ice skating rink too.Overall, it was a morning well spent.", January 2016

In addition to seeing the unique architecture of the building, there is a self-guided tour of City Hall which includes a few interesting stops. First, you can see the tallest vertical garden in the world which spans seven stories up the inner wall of the City Hall building. The self-guided walk also takes you up to the 8th and 9th floor Sky Plaza and exhibition gallery. There are a couple of cafes in this area as well. You then descend into the lower levels of the building where you find building ruins known as the Gungisi Relics, an unexpected find at City Hall. Additionally, there is a design shop, more art space and open lounge area. There was a duet performing a few Korean tunes during the time of our visit. That was neat to watch for a few minutes.  Overall, we enjoyed our short visit to Seoul City Hall. This is not a major attraction but a neat place if you enjoy unique architecture and peculiar attractions like the vertical garden located here.

Another must see and visit in Seoul downtown.", September 2015

123,5.0,"It's worth your time, just to simply breathe the lobby air.","The New Seoul City Hall was opened to the public just 3 years ago on August of 2012 and it shines as an amazing e-building on many levels. Depending on the time of year and the outside climate, the rush of the clean air made by the thousands of plants on the walls will knock your socks off.  I have almost always seen a public display of art and culture on the ground floor, so you can take in all this wonderful air. There is an observation lounge for the public on the 9th floor where you can meet and drink nice coffee.  There, you'll also notice how much attention was given towards recycling energy. Gas lined windows, solar panels, the naturally climate controlled environment, and more. If that doesn't impress you, make your way to the Old City Hall that has been renovated to a public library. Four full floors of public library space is a heaven to thousands of citizens daily. If you can find it, you can snap an impressive selfie while governing from the Mayor's Desk~! Oh, then there's the museum that showcases some impressive remnants of Seoul's past. Lastly, make your way to the deck and you'll me able to view the New City Hall from the best vantage point. Oh, there is history over the choosing of design and some significance of the structure itself (something about a wave, not Hallyu) but that's on another page. Easy way to spend about a good 4 hours. Enjoy~!", April 2015
124,4.0,"Unique design, both out and inside.","I stumbled upon Seoul City Hall during Christmastime and was pleasantly surprised and quite impressed with its architectural design, both inside and outside. During the winter, there is a ice skating rink right in front with tall Christmas tree which could be romantic, but also fun for kids.Inside, there are sections that are strictly for workers there, but there are also many areas for the public to visit. When you first step in, there is an enormous wall of green vines faced by the glass wall of the building. There are some hanging bubble-like sculptures that light up at night. Quite beautiful. There are some artsy shops and cafes and a bookstore inside. There is a sci-fi-looking video wall where kids can play some video games. There is a miniature museum that shows an excavation site (I think of what they found maybe beneath the construction site of this city hall? Can't remember...) Apparently, there are free concerts from time to time (I didn't see one, but I did see the small stages and seating areas). There are some interesting looking conference rooms that are quite grandiose. It's actually quite hard to describe as it is such a mix of everything.I would like to eventually return when I have more time to explore it more fully or to even take a tour of the building.", December 2014

There is also a great plaza that is often used for large events, and where you can gather easily.
