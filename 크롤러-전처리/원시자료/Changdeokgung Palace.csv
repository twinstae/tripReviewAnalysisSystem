0,4.0,History feels,I was reluctant first to visit but we give it a try since we came from the Bukchon Hanok Village and I didn't regret visiting the Palace. This gave us the South Korean locale feels. I think the place was so huge that we didn't get the chance to walk around as it's our last day before the midnight flight. I highly recommend visiting this Palace before leaving SK!, December 2019
1,5.0,A beautiful spot!,"My son, husband and I decided to visit the Changdeokgung Palace during our visit to Seoul. There are other Palaces in Seoul but we decided to go see this one since it is the only one that is considered a Unesco Heritage site and it's also within walking distance to the Hangbok Cultural Village which is another neat thing to do.We got an English tour guide and did a tour of the Secret Garden. it being February not a lot was in bloom and it'd be stunning I'm sure to go during the spring or summer when the Lotus Ponds and the flowers are in season. The Garden takes up almost 60% of the entire area of the Palace. We were told in the old days tigers would occasionally appear within the Garden walls! :) The garden incorporates a lotus pond, pavilions, and landscaped lawns, trees, and flowers. There are over 26,000 specimens of a hundred different species of trees in the garden and some of the trees behind the palace are over 300 years old.The Palace was constructed in 1405, destroyed in the late 1500's by the Japanese and then rebuilt in 1610 and served as the Main palace for about 270 years. You can feel the history around you as you stroll. Admission is 3000 Korean Won which equals $3.30 Canadian and also includes tickets to the Gyeongbokgung Palace, the Deoksugung Palace,  the Changgyeonggung Palace and the Jongmyo Shrine. The tickets don't expire until 3 months after purchase so if you have time to go see them all it's an amazing deal. (It's an amazing deal just to get in to one!!!) :)A must see if in Seoul.", January 2020
2,5.0,Don't forget to visit the Secret Garden,"If you have little to no knowledge of Korean history (like me), I'd suggest you to take the guided tour. The guide was friendly, knowledgeable and very accommodating. Book your ticket to Secret Garden online and you can book 7 days earlier prior to your visit. I took the last tour of the day and there were less people in the evening.", October 2019
3,5.0,My Favorite Palace!,"If you are going to do one palace, this is the one to do! It is the prettiest out of the 5 palaces in Seoul. They have the secret garden in the back that you can take with a guided tour.", February 2020
4,5.0,"As the English pamphlet states, “A Look at a true Korean Beauty”","Set within a large park, accessible by subway, bus or tour, this Prospering Virtue Palace was built during the Joseon Dynasty.  It served as the main palace for nearly 270 years following its destruction during the Japanese invasion and its subsequent rebuilding.A visitor may note that one building in particular, the Seonjeongjeon Hall is the only building featuring a tiled blue roof.  There indeed is a love story to the history of this exquisite and beautiful palace, yet I shall leave that for the visitor to enjoy on their visit.  One detail in particular that distinguishes this palace from other palaces of the Joseon Dynasty is the palace gardens, and I am already planning my return trip to behold the “Quintessence of Joseon-era Landscaping” in spring or summer, to step where Kings and Queens strolled, relaxed, and perhaps engaged in sericulture. To truly savor visiting the Changdeokgung Palace I need to walk its gardens, valleys, pavilions and behold the lotus ponds and then see the Palace from otherwise hidden views.The Secret Garden occupies more than half of the entirety of Changdeokgung Palace, and I am delighted to plan my return to see the views from the Buyongji Pond and Juhamnu Pavilion, Aeryeonji Pond and Uiduhap, the New Seonwonjeon (New Royal Shrine) and so much more.In the meantime I hope you enjoy my photographs of Changdeokgung Palace.Please note that the admission to the Changdeokgung Palace is separate from the admission to the Secret Garden and, at least as of this writing, there is (but verify this) a Royal Palace Pass valid for 3 months from the purchase date, which includes admission to the Changdeokgung Palace and the Secret Garden; the Gyeongbokgung Palace;the Changgyeonggung Palace;the Deoksugung Palace; andthe Jongmyo Shrine.", January 2020
