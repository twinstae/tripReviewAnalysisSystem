0,4.0,History feels,I was reluctant first to visit but we give it a try since we came from the Bukchon Hanok Village and I didn't regret visiting the Palace. This gave us the South Korean locale feels. I think the place was so huge that we didn't get the chance to walk around as it's our last day, December 2019
1,5.0,A beautiful spot!,"My son, husband and I decided to visit the Changdeokgung Palace during our visit to Seoul. There are other Palaces in Seoul but we decided to go see this one since it is the only one that is considered a Unesco Heritage site and it's also within walking distance to the Hangbok", January 2020
2,5.0,Don't forget to visit the Secret Garden,"If you have little to no knowledge of Korean history (like me), I'd suggest you to take the guided tour. The guide was friendly, knowledgeable and very accommodating. Book your ticket to Secret Garden online and you can book 7 days earlier prior to your visit. I took the last tour of the day and there were less people in the evening.", October 2019
3,5.0,My Favorite Palace!,"If you are going to do one palace, this is the one to do! It is the prettiest out of the 5 palaces in Seoul. They have the secret garden in the back that you can take with a guided tour.", February 2020
4,5.0,"As the English pamphlet states, “A Look at a true Korean Beauty”","Set within a large park, accessible by subway, bus or tour, this Prospering Virtue Palace was built during the Joseon Dynasty.  It served as the main palace for nearly 270 years following its destruction during the Japanese invasion and its subsequent rebuilding.A visitor may note that one building in particular, the Seonjeongjeon Hall is the only building featuring a tiled blue roof.  There indeed is a love story to the history of this exquisite and beautiful palace, yet I shall leave that for the visitor to enjoy on their visit.  One detail in particular that distinguishes this palace from other palaces of the Joseon Dynasty is the palace gardens, and I am already planning my return trip to behold the “Quintessence of Joseon-era Landscaping” in spring or summer, to step where Kings and Queens strolled, relaxed, and perhaps engaged in sericulture. To truly savor visiting the Changdeokgung Palace I need to walk its gardens, valleys, pavilions and behold the lotus ponds and then see the Palace from otherwise hidden views.The Secret Garden occupies more than half of the entirety of Changdeokgung Palace, and I am delighted to plan my return to see the views from the Buyongji Pond and Juhamnu Pavilion, Aeryeonji Pond and Uiduhap, the New Seonwonjeon (New Royal Shrine) and so much more.In the meantime I hope you enjoy my photographs of Changdeokgung Palace.Please note that the admission to the Changdeokgung Palace is separate from the admission to the Secret Garden and, at least as of this writing, there is (but verify this) a Royal Palace Pass valid for 3 months from the purchase date, which includes admission to the Changdeokgung Palace and the Secret Garden; the Gyeongbokgung Palace;the Changgyeonggung Palace;the Deoksugung Palace; andthe Jongmyo Shrine.", January 2020

7,3.0,"Nicely preserved, but not much to see...","From Anguk subway station, head east from Exit 3, and you will find the entrance to the palace.  Admission was reasonable at 3,000 won.  You get to see the Throne Hall, with the impressive king's chair.  Other than that, a lot was under repair, and you don't get to access the King's residence building, so not much to see.  We didn't know how or if you could access the Queen's residence building (behind the King's residence building)... so overall, we didn't get to see much; however, the ones we saw were well preserved.", December 2019

16,2.0,Seen one seen them all ,It’s a nice Palace but having been to a few now in Korea it’s a little tiring.

18,5.0,Beautiful!,"The buildings are lovely here, but for me the main reason to visit is the secret garden. It is wonderful! You enter the garden with a group according to language, but to be honest I ditched them as soon as I was inside as I wanted to do my own thing and some peace and quiet. I was lucky enough to visit during autumn and it didn't disappoint...it was full of beautiful colours. You will need a couple of hours to do the place justice and be prepared to walk up and down and then down and up...totally worth it though.If you arrive in hanbok (Korean traditional dress) you get for free!", November 2019

Changdeokgung Palace is also known as Donggwol, the Eastern Palace, because of its location to the east of Gyeongbokgung Palace.Was amazed and thrilled of how the Joseon Dynasty was ruled. They preserve the architecture of the building pretty well. Took some awesome pictures of Injeongjeon & Daejajeon. Love the story behind how the king ruled his ministry and kingdom.", December 2019
21,5.0,"Worth a visit, catch their daily guards parade",This ancient palace is worth a visit and also to capture the beauty of the Korean rich palaces and culture of ancient days. Best to get there before their daily changing of the guards at the palace entrance., November 2019
22,5.0,Beautiful palace with amazing garden,"We chose this palace to visit its biwon/secret garden. There was a discount if you bought combined entrance tickets and joined english speaking guide tour. After finished visiting a mesmerizing garden, we walked to gyeongbokgung palace to watch royal guard changing ceremony at 2p.m. for you to be able to do this, it is advisable for you to join changdeokgung palace tour at 9.30 a.m and subsequently secret garden tour at 11 a.m. the tour will be finished around 12.30 and you have ample time to return your rented hanbok.", February 2019
23,5.0,Amazing Secret Garden,"It is an older palace compared to the rebuilt Gyeongbukgong. The highlight of this palace to me is the Secret Garden at the back of this palace. There is a separate entrance fee to the garden. Entrance is strictly by guided tours only. It is limited to 100 visitors per guided tour. The English tour is at 2.30pm daily, and the garden is closed on Wednesdays. My visit to this palace was on a Wednesday but was not told the Secret Garden is closed. I went back on Thursday again to visit the Secret Garden, and had to pay for another palace entrance fee as the garden is only accessible from inside the palace. Lol", November 2019
24,3.0,Great historical visit,"Great place to visit for the historical feel and exploration. Colours in the winter are generally dull, but was a good cultural heritage site.", February 2017
25,5.0,Great history and beautiful grounds.,"This is a great place to visit that is rich in history. There is a small cost but well worth it. If you are over 65 yrs old it is free. If you didn't book with a guide, just find one and walk close with them. The building are amazing, it is an easy walk. You feel like you are out in the country instead of in the middle of the city.", October 2019
26,4.0,Must see on Seoul,Amazing piece of history of Korea in the heart of Seoul city. Take your walking shoes and stroll across time whilst observing people dressed in traditional clothing taking their pictures., December 2019
27,4.0,A beautiful palace amidst the hustle of the city.,"Visited the palace first before Gyeongbokgung.  Read reviews that this palace was designed to be in harmony with the environment and after arriving there, it can be observed as to how it is.  For a Palace, it is certainly not imposing as the Gyeongbokgung one and certainly no surprise why many princes chose to have their palace here.   Unfortunately, I did not follow any guided tour for the front part if the palace, thus may have missed much interesting snippets.  However the guided tour to the ""Secret Garden"" is a must.  Only entered with a guided tour, they are conducted at different times for different languages.  I say it's a must so when you visit, u can imagine how the palace designers have made much effort to be a environmentally harmonious building.  Do make a point to visit it.", December 2019
28,5.0,The best palace we visited in Korea,"There are three other palaces in Seoul alone; this one has buildings that are as original as wooden buildings can ever be after several hundred years, whereas most - not all - wooden palace and temple buildings in Korea are essentailly reconstructions or rebuilds from pieces. This is a massive park site, and you have to look up the times of tours for the hidden gardens (in your language) as you can't just wander round them.", November 2019
29,5.0,Stunning,A pleasant surprise. This is a 600 year old heritage site. Awesome beautiful place to visit. Loved the stroll around the palace., June 2019
30,5.0,Dressed like a royal for a day,"The palace covers a large area. So be prepared to walk in comfy footwear. There are many sections of the palace to explore and a conservatory / green house and a lake. Need at least a day to cover most grounds which we ran out of time as we were busy taking photos at every turn (almost!).There is a map of the palace located in various section so you know where you are going. In total about 15 sections. The autumn scape is of vibrant and fiery red as the maple trees / leaves change for the season. Very colourful and scenic. Worth a visit. You can also hire the traditional attire - Hanbok from nearby shop. We bought rented our Hanbok via an app for 4-hour and it only cost us US$15 each, and also get free admission in to the palace. If you are in Seoul for a few days try this experience!", November 2019
31,5.0,Spectacles galore!,"An early 09.00 start made it easy to buy the $3 ticket, which was for the Palace complex beyond the courtyard. Free activities included the Royal Palace Museum and 10.00 changing of the guard parade. Information booths and free pamphlets in multiple languages are available for free and were indispensable. The palace buildings are on a grand scale and beautiful despite being rebuilt after many historical setbacks and unfortunate damage. It doesn't detract from the majesty of the culture and location. The museum is informative and well stocked with interesting artefacts. Gift shops and WC facilities are available everywhere (Carry emergency paper!). The parade was a very entertaining spectacle with accompanying music, drill and PA narration. A pagoda in the distance identifies the Folk Museum Park at the rear. Modern architecture and electronic advertising screens on a large scale are juxtaposed against the ancient/traditional palace environs. On the outside corner of the palace complex lies a'gate' tower and a heavily populated fancy dress hire shop. Many locals and tourists alike hire costumes and enact traditional Korean life all around the city. Glorious and fun!", November 2019

33,5.0,5/5,"A much often overlooked attraction compared to its more renowned 'sister' palace, the Gyeongbokgong.The palace grounds are larger and the palace was used as a residence for the royal family back in the old days. Recommend to visit during the autumn due to sights of the structures complemented by the bright colors of the autumn foliage", November 2019
34,5.0,Changdeokgung Palace,Changdeokgung palace is a world heritage listed palace complex.  It is indeed a very magnificent complex to visit and some of the inside buildings are accessible to the general public.  One interesting area is the pharmacy building which has been furnished  in the period of the reigning Joseon royalty.   There was also an area that one could experience the beauty products made for the royal ladies.  It is an expansive area to visit even though some areas are under extensive renovation.  An added feature were visitors and locals dressed in traditional costumes taking advantage of the historical backdrop for photo ops.  These individuals dressed in traditional garments added to the enchantment of this complex.  We did not pay to visit the Secret Garden area. None the less it was still a very magical and enjoyable visit., November 2019
35,4.0,Nice palace & secret garden ,"This palace also has an extension which is called the secret garden. There is an additional fee of 5000 won to enter the secret garden, which has buildings set amidst trees and landscaping. The palace complex is vast and the guided tour took a lot of time.

37,5.0,Well preserved palaces and beautiful garden,It is by far my favourite site in all Seoul. The palaces are interesting but the big highlight is the secret garden. The foliage in November was so so pretty. I wanted to spend just one hour and ended spending most of the afternoon. It was just super relaxing., November 2019

40,4.0,Moonlight Tour,This tour includes a guided tour of the palace grounds at night plus a performance at the end if the tour. We were served hot Korean tea in a disposable cup and given a goodie bag containing a purse and a bar of soap. It would have been nice if we were given some traditional Korean sweets instead of the soap. Try the moonlight tour if you want a different experience but do note the price is much higher than the day ticket., October 2019
41,4.0,Beautiful secret garden in Autumn ,Secret garden for the Palace is totally recommended for a visit during Autumn. The scenery is captivating., November 2019
42,5.0,Impressive,"no wonder this palace is classify at the UNESCO; the construction is impressive and well preserved;  you will like the different color tiles and sculptures; if you go in summer, make sure you go early as it can be really hot there.", July 2019
43,4.0,Lovely palace,"Changdeokgung and the adjacent Changgyeonggung are my favourties in Seoul. In spring they have beautiful cherry blossoms and in autumn they have attractive autumn colours.

46,4.0,TONNES of Photography Opportunities!,"Like Gyeongbokgung Palace, my wife and I been to the day before, Changdeokgung Palace offers visitors many, many photography opportunities.My wife rented a hanbok from one of the numerous hanbok rental shops in the palace's vicinity and for 4 hours, we toured the palace snapping away on my camera. Just like Gyeongbokgung Palace, we had no idea what the significance of any of historical building/ artifact we were looking at since we were without a guide. But hey, our family album has been significantly fattened up after that trip.If you are into culture and history, follow a guide.Pro Tip: The man at the entrance taking visitors' admission tickets, told me that because my wife was wearing a hanbok, she did not need to pay admission. However, the line back at the ticketing booth was too long so I could not be bothered to go back to refund her ticket.So, do not quote me on this. Go find out if this is indeed the case and save yourself some Korean won!", October 2019

48,4.0,Interesting and quieter palace,I went to Changdeokgung Palace on a Sunday afternoon. It has less much people than Gyeongbokgung Palace. But I was not disappointed. I had opportunity to take many beautiful photos with interruption from other tourists. Don't expect grand buildings here as well as other palaces in Seoul. It offers a different kind of beauty and experience comparing to palaces in Beijing., October 2019

50,5.0,Don't miss the Secret Garden tour for the most beautiful photograph opportunities,To a Westerner there seems little difference between the many palaces of Seoul but Changdeokgung stands out because of the beautiful Secret Garden tour. When you finish the tour the gate to Changgyeonggung is just on your left - not as interesting but worth a quick look if you have the palace pass., September 2019
51,5.0,a bit of history,I went there in the last Wednesday of the month - when all museum and culture sites are free. Of course there were a lot of people wondering by. The people dressed in the traditional Korean clothes gives a nice feel to it all., October 2019

55,4.0,Beautiful and serene,"We had very limited time at Seoul, so I only had the option to visit 1 palace during my trip. As we rented hanbok at Bukchon Hanok Village, we decided to go to Changdeokgung as it is a bit closer. The palace is not that big, but we had ample time taking pictures within the palace as there were not many visitors on that day. I wish we could have more time to join the tour for secret garden.", October 2019
56,4.0,Worth a visit,The palace grounds are quite extensive with large ponds and a separate garden area which costs extra but worth seeing.  Initially you have a guide but you can leave the group to look around on your own if you want., October 2019

58,5.0,Another great palace,This is another great palace. It is not the biggest one but still one of the five more important ones., October 2019
59,5.0,Do you need to go online for ticket to Secret Garden?,"Online tickets to the secret garden always sold out. You can go directly to the palace and get the tickets over there. If you need a guided tour (Won10,000) and it will last for 1 hour. But if you are in a hurry, you can get the ticket for just Won1000. You can get the ticket either at the main entrance or right in front of the garden entrance. Highly recommended you go visiting the garden as it is very serene and beautiful and it is an easy walk.", October 2019
60,4.0,Glad to have stopped by.,"Admissions is cheap here, and to be able to stroll the grounds of the palace makes it a worthy destination for the tourist visiting Seoul.", October 2019
61,4.0,Day visit,Use the side entrance— no one is there and you don’t have to wait in the really long lines at the main entrance. For me and nieces it was 6k won. Game changer., October 2019
62,5.0,"So close to other attractions, so definitely worth at least popping in!","Beautiful! Definitely worth walking around for a bit - especially since it's so close to Bukchon Hanok Village, Insa-dong, etc. Didn't do the secret garden tour, but wish I had. Gorgeous colors, as is typical with Korean architecture.", October 2019
63,5.0,"Beautiful, but do not underestimate the amount of walking required","Beautifully restored palace that is worth a visit. Be prepared for a lot of walking, a lot of steps - so this isn't necessarily great for someone who is challenged with either. But otherwise, it's great to visit and be able to wander at your own pace through all the buildings and admire the grounds.Notes:- Get the audioguide, it's well worth it- If you have to pick just one palace, I would still go for the larger and grander Gyeongbokgung - If you are planning to visit Changdeokgung as well, you should couple this palace with it as the two abut each other and there is an internal ticketing and entry point from this palace to Changdeokgung", October 2019
64,5.0,A beautiful restored palace and area,"This is like a smaller version of the main palace in Beijing.  It is designed very similarly, though a little smaller.  The buildings were rebuilt after the Japanese occupation from 1910-1935, when it was torn down.  They actually had underground heating before the Chinese did. It is a beautiful place.  Try and see the guard change ceremony; it's amazing.  There is a lot of walking and there are really big stairs.  This is not a place for people with movement issued.  I was really tired but the end.  We had a guide and I would suggest one if you really want to understand this place.  What a wonderful experience.", October 2019

80,5.0,The most impressive Royal Palace in Seoul,"Changdeokgung Palace is the most well-preserved Palace from the Joseon Dynasty. This is the place where the King and their ministers dicussed about Political affairs and was the residence of the Royal Family, too.As all the palaces, it was burnt during the japanese invasion and, later, it was rebuilt.Do not let to visit the Secret Garden and enjoy its  peaceful atmosphere.", August 2019
81,5.0,My favorite Seoul Palace,"This palace is quieter than the central site.  It's close to Bukchon Village and great places to eat and cafes.  Just a beautiful, sprawling historical landscape.", September 2019
82,4.0,Lovely architecture & a feel for Royal living,"Visited this Palace first & picked up a free guide outside the Palace. These are students that are practicing their languages & are very helpful & friendly. They wear orange tops & can be found outside the entrance area. They give an excellent overview without going into too much depth.The Palace architecture is lovely, but the buildings contain very little themselves.Tickets can be purchased to access the secret garden too. This does require an official guide & your given your tour start time. The guide is very helpful & informative & does go into lots more detail. As you meander through the gardens, mainly trees, there are pavilions & water feature areas. The walk/tour does have steeper areas.Both are worth a visit it you want a feel for Royal living", September 2019
83,4.0,lovely palace to visit,"The Changdeokgung Palace is smaller than Gyeongbokgung (faster to see if you are short on time) and quite beautiful.  With more time visiting both on the same day is possible.  Entry is 3,000 won for adults and 1,500 won for youth, garden an additional 5,000/2,400.  The palace can be appreciated wandering on your own or guided tours are available in Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and English throughout the day.  It can get a little crowded so a morning visit may be a better option than afternoon (opens at 0900 daily).  Really an interesting place and amazing to imagine the royalty living in these buildings not too long ago.", June 2019
84,5.0,Favorite of the palaces and secret garden was fabulous,"Please do not miss the GARDEN. It was gorgeous and the guide was outstanding. If I had one palace to go to ,this would be it,but I would take the garden over the palace itself if the time was limited.

85,4.0,The Second Palace Dating Back To 1405,This was a secondary palace  of the Joseon Dynasty that ruled from 1392 -1910. The original palace was built in 1405 and was secondary to the bigger palace just down the road. It was destroyed when the Japanese invaded  between 1592 -1598 and was rebuilt in 1610. This was an impressive series of buildings  and definitely worth a look. Access is via Ext 3 of the Anguk Station., September 2019
86,4.0,Secret Garden worth a look!,"We went to the palace on the Korean Thanksgiving Day, so entry was free. However, we had booked a walking tour of the secret garden. The tour was in English, and you can only go into the secret garden with a guide. It is not accessible to the general public. Our guide was very sweet, and very knowledgeable about the history of the palace and the garden. The walk lasts 90 minutes, and there are 4 stops along the way. It is hilly in parts and somewhat shady, but on a warm day a fan is advisable to help keep cool. After the tour we were free to explore the palace, which has many buildings. There was a gift shop where you could also buy a drink but not food. There are 5 palaces in Seoul, but we chose to visit this one purely for the secret garden tour and we were glad we did.", September 2019
87,5.0,Charming Palace and Beautiful Secret Garden,"Changdeokgung Palace has a timeless beauty that will make you visit again and again. It is no wonder why the ancient kings and royalties preferred here than the main palace. We are lucky to be in time for the 1030am guided tour into the palace's secret garden, a huge garden with Instagram worthy pavilion. The best pavilion is the one with the mini rice paddy field!", September 2019
88,4.0,Go befare the storm,"Beautiful visit, The koreans have rebuilt this site to look very authentic and with a great eye for detail. The buildings itself are beautiful but when you add the awesome scenery in the background it becomes an epic picture perfect experience.To enjoy the experience to the fullest, be sure to arrive early. If you come at noon it is packed with tourist which for me really ruins the experience.HOT TIP!!! If you dress in traditional Korean attire, you can get free access!", September 2019
89,4.0,Changing of the guards is a must.,I think many people do not realise that if you visit at either 10 am or 2pm you can see the changing of the guards. If you are visiting it makes sense to see this.The Palace is quite substantial and well maintained. Interesting to watch all the folks dressed in traditional style Korean outfits taking photos!A nice few hours and right next to the Buchan Hanok village., September 2019
90,3.0,"Overall , not over impressed!","It was our first day in Seoul, and having our small rented apartment nearby and it was a free entry day, it was our first visit!If I say it  set the tone for similar visits over our 4 days in Seoul , I would not say we were greatly impressed!  The great halls  are quite impressive in themselves ( although most parts are later reconstructions resulting from hostile events in Japanese/Korean history! However , overall, the site seems to lack any coherence to help the visitor to understand the history of the place! There is very little access INTO any of these buildings and rather too many notices       "" Do not step!"" A big  minus point in this and seemingly most of the central Seoul historic sites is the use of SAND on most of the pathways in the complex! Seoul seems to be quite a windy city , even when summer temperatures top 35 degrees, everything is covered in a thin layer sand , including visitors! We did pay for a guided tour of the Secret Garden, really not a greatly rewarding experience ( even if you could understand the guide's English ) but you're not allowed to go around except on a tour?", August 2019
91,5.0,Beautiful and big,"The Changeokgungn Palace s beautiful and it is big! In the center of the city, it’s gardens and paths are peaceful. It was quite hot the day we visited, but shade was abundant and the various buildings were very interesting. Signs were helpful to gain insights and understanding. We enjoyed our 2 hour stroll among the sights and gardens. It is well worth the visit.", August 2019
92,4.0,nice place,"nice place for photoshoot with your hanbok.with hanbok, you go inside for free.i booked a secret garden tour and its nice but do this only if you have time. garden of morning calm is far better.", September 2019
93,5.0,"Lovely place to visit, take your walking shoes!","The palace is one of history and culture.  It is worthwhile to book a docine or guide to take you around as there are statures and carvings that have meanings, as well as entrances that were for kings or servants, which you wouldn't necessarily know about.  The palace and grounds are huge! we went on a warm day in summer and it was very pleasant however we did spend hours walking.   The palace is free to walk around, however the King's gardens are not, so try to book a session the day before if it is a busy tourist time.", August 2019
94,5.0,fell the history of Koea,The is very impressive palace. I have re-visited this palace after 10 years. I could not see the guardians in front of main gate. The watch-change ceramony was very fescinating. Thre are lots of buildings in the palace with very special fuctionality. I suggest you to join a tour with guidance. the icture on cailing are impressed me., September 2019

97,4.0,beautiful old Palace,"Having seen old architecture in surrounding countries, the Korean style shows its own characteristics - a bit more austere than Chinese temples - and different color palette.", July 2019
98,5.0,"When in Seoul, this is a MUST!","The palaces are beautiful and the grounds are well-landscaped. The original buildings were burned by the Japanese during their occupation of Korea, so these are recreations, but feel ancient. The guides at the library are very kind and helpful providing very interesting information. Take your time, there is a lot to see. It is also common to see people dressed in the garb of that time period which really adds to the atmosphere as you wander the grounds. There is so much history here. And if you are there in the summer, bring the sun umbrellas. It is hot and rain is frequent at that time of year. The little cafe has limited offerings, so you may want to bring food. Note of caution: If you take the Hop On Hop Off bus, they drop you off a quite a ways from the entrance. It is better to get off at the stop prior; it is much closer to the entrance.", August 2019
99,5.0,Must see,Lovely place filled with history. There is so much to see. We did t have time to do the secret gardens. It was a very good visit., May 2019
100,5.0,Just Beautiful,We booked hanboks online before our arrival so were admitted for free and spent 2 1/2 hours wandering the grounds and taking pictures. We saw many Korean school groups who asked to take pictures with my blond kids and read us paragraphs in English. Everyone was so friendly. We lucked into watching the changing of the guard so look for the times on the website. Very little shade there so a hat or umbrella would be nice. Don’t miss it!, June 2019
101,5.0,The Secret Garden is the MUST see,"Beautiful palace, but the true highlight is the Secret Garden. 90 minute tour with no more than 100 others - it sounds like a lot, and to be honest this was the most tourists we saw in one place in all the palaces.The tour guide was knowledgeable - and stated key facts (e.g. shooting locations for Netflix's Kingdom and the history). Be careful with the Secret Garden if you have health issues, as there are steep slopes up and down and uneven terrain. Would not recommend with a push chair or wheelchair (although it says you can do).The rest of the Palace is alright in comparison, but you need to access the Palace to access the Secret Garden.Get both as part of the Royal Palace Pass - note, on the day you need to go to a ticket office to book a specific time slot for the Secret Garden - this is all explained in the ticket book.", September 2019
102,4.0,World Heritage site. Secret Garden tour,"This palace is huge. Slightly bigger in area then Gyeongbokgung but this is a UNESCO heritage site. A secret garden tour cost additional 5000W to the entrance fees of 3000W. The tour is conducted hourly and take you into the inner part of the palace compound with a guide who gives further insight and explanation. Here you will be able to see more pavilion, ponds and gardens. The tour takes 90 minutes and involved walking up and down the hilly path.", September 2019
103,4.0,Don't miss it,"A Beautiful Place in the heart of Seoul.It's pretty similar to Gyeongbokgung palace and not too far from it.With no doubt a must see during a visit in Seoul. Ticket Price is only 3.000 won, but the day I went was free entry.", August 2019
104,5.0,Good place for Hanbok ( Korean Traditional dress) experience ,The palace has nothing special but is good for the Korean Traditional dress called Hanbok experience and photos. Just accors  the road ( opposite to this palace) there is a shop for Traditional dress rental. They charge around kRW 15000 for 2 hours rental for dress. They provide all facilities like rentals lockers within this price. Ladies hair dress is additional KRW 5000. Overall a good experience to go for this. Please also note that in case you are wearing the Traditional clothes the entry fee to palace is waived off. The place is easily accessible through public transport. The palace may be hot is summer and mostly uncovered in case of rain. So better carry an umbrella in summary or rainy season. No F&B option in palace. Better to carry your water bottles. They have washroom inside., August 2019

106,4.0,Beautiful and interesting part of culture,"Although it was a very hot (42°C) day, I challenged myself to walk through the whole domain, and it was worth the sweat :) A big domain with beautiful old, cultural buildings. An additional touch is given by the possibility to dress in typical clothing, and there is the change of guards as well.Not expensive for the time you can spend here.", August 2019
107,5.0,Beautiful palace grounds,"There are 5 palaces in Seoul, but this UNESCO heritage site was the favored one of Joseon Dynasty rulers; the palace is meant to blend in with its natural surroundings with beautiful hues of green and floral designs.  We went on a rainy day and either the weather or the site itself meant the crowds were minimal. In addition, we got free admission because many sites have free admission for the weeks around National Liberation Day.While we covered only a few buildings, I appreciated the architecture and designs.  We would definitely return again and wear hanbok as well!", August 2019
108,5.0,The nicest palace in seoul - don't miss this,"Does not have the changing of the guard, but it does have the Secret Garden.  There is construction, so the free tours are cut short.  The construction will be ongoing through 2020.", August 2019

110,3.0,Not overly impressed - Average experience without Secret Garden,"On the day of our visit, the entrance ticket was free except for access to the Secret Garden which I did not take. The place is nice & calm to visit with nice open pavilions and courtyards but that's probably every area of the palace. I've read reviews about Secret Garden being absolutely beautiful, so if you do visit this palace, I highly recommend paying the entrance fee to the Secret Garden.", August 2019
111,5.0,Perfect,It is like a mirror that shows us how this developed world emerged from its unique history. Soldiers make a morning show for visitors., August 2019
112,5.0,Better than Gyeongbokgung,"Having lived in Korea for almost a year now, I think it's fair to say that I've had my fair share of temples and palaces. I almost didn't go to this one, but I'm glad that I did! I like the flair and vibe of this palace a lot more than Gyeongbokgung. The layout of the palace made me feel like I was truly exploring ancient Korea. Make sure to try hanbok when you go (it was around ₩15,000 for 4 hours and the rental store that I went to was right across the street from Chandeokgung), as it authenticates the experience!", May 2019
113,5.0,A palace to walk into the ancient Korea,"""It's a must go when visiting Korea."" That's what I was thinking when planning to visit Korea and I was so right. I bought the ticket of the secret garden online and checked their free general tour schedule before we went.

114,5.0,World Heritage listed Royal Palace,"Changdeokgung is a UNESCO World Heritage listed site. It is a superb example of Josean Dynesty architecture. It is the main palace of the 5 in Seoul. There are free guided tours of the palace (in English) but a self guided tour is good enough unless you really need to know the finer points of Josean Dynesty royal life. Entry is only 3000KW approximately £2. There is a royal palace pass which gives access to 4 palaces and Jongmyo Shrine, it costs 10,000KW, but the combined cost of all the individual sites is 9,000KW!!", July 2019
115,5.0,Beautiful palace,"We went for the complimentary English tour. The guide spoke good and clear English compared to other tours we did in Seoul. I do recommend going for the guided tour to really understand and appreciate this magnificent palace. The Secret Garden tour is also recommended. Changdeokgung is included in integrated ticket for the palaces. A very good deal if you have enough time to go all 4 palaces, Secret Garden and Jongmyo Shrine.", July 2019
116,5.0,Glimpse into the Joseon dynasty history ,"This is the most special of all the palaces and probably the one to visit in case you plan on doing one only. The palace is spacious with large open places. Tourists are not allowed inside much of the covered areas and most of the time you are out in the open. So it can be harsh during summers. But still if you are touring seoul this is one of the must do activities. Just be prepared for the walk and the sun.The secret garden tour is amazing and can only be taken as a guided tour of roughly 70 min duration in summers and 90 during other times. Most of cultural heritage sites including this palace in seoul are free to enter from Aug 10 -25, due to National Liberation Day celebrations...however secret garden tour is paid and needs to be booked atleast a day prior. There is a souvenir and refreshment shop inside for the tourists. From the inside one can also tour the Changgyeonggung palace since the two are connected. The entire tour including the palaces and secret garden can take from 2-3 hours.", August 2019

123,5.0,Interesting Residential Palace.,"I visited this palace as part of a Seoul City Tour company tour.  It was very helpful to have a tour guide explain this palace to us. This palace was used for mainly residential purposes.  The palace is huge with many buildings as well as a garden.  It also is on the Lonely Planet's Ultimate Travel List, and it has a Traveler's Choice award. I was surprised that this site was not very busy.

127,5.0,Fabulous Tour Guide,"What made this palace stand out was the excellent English-language tour guide who filled out time there with colorful stories of the previous residents of this palace.  We highly recommend that you join one of the frequent tours (including with admission).  It will make the place come alive, instead of being just another palace.  We did not go on to tour the gardens, but were very happy with what we learned on just the palace tour.  Do not miss this when you're in Seoul!", May 2019
128,4.0,Changdeokgung Palace,"This palace is not as crowded and has a huge secret garden or forbidden garden that occupies about 60% of the palace compound. The garden was only accessible to the Korean kings and royal family in the past. The palace itself is not big.  There are free guided tours of palace around 1 hour available in english, chinese and korean. The palace entrance fee is very affordable at around USD3/pax. Garden guided tour fee is a separate fee at USD4/pax and garden tour takes 70 mins. Worth a visit.", July 2019
129,5.0,"Beautiful, authentic","This palace is smaller than Gyeongbokgung palace, but it is still very large, and unlike the larger one, has more original buildings. I recommend taking the english language tour. I feel I got a lot more out of it than just looking at all the pretty buildings, but if you don't have time, grab an english map at the entrance. Also, the signs throughout are in several languages. I also took the secret garden tour, which costs extra. It took me several hours to see everything. I liked this palace best. The tourists and locals walking around in Hanboks made for good pictures too.", July 2019
130,5.0,Very Beautiful,This palace is small than Gyengbokgung but very beautiful with traditional architecture. There is a way links to the Deoksugung which have a lake and very unique glass house. It might take 2 hours to visit this place., June 2019

It is extremely peaceful and a wonderful place to spend an afternoon.We took the English guided tour and loved it. The palace is large and well cared for. You can't go inside the buildings which is too bad. I originally thought they were too  old but in fact most of the palaces in Seoul are reproductions. Every time Korea was invaded the palaces were torn down.The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the lack of accessibility for wheel chairs. They do provide wheelchairs but the one I used was not well maintained; it was extremely difficult to push and part way through the tour I had to turn back because of a staircase.", June 2019
133,5.0,Absolutely Amazing,"Absolutely magnificent palace complex. I spent about 5 hours wandering around the inner and outer court before exploring the palace itself and the secret gardens.I was mesmerised by it to be honest. I intended to spend a couple of hours, a half day at most, but ended up spending pretty much a whole day here.The gardens are extra, 5000 won, but are well worth it. The place is stunning obviously but don't rush through the inner and outer courtyards as they are just as enchanting.One of the best days I've had on tour in a long, longt ime and definitely the best and most beautiful attraction in  Seoul. An absolute must-do in my opinion.", July 2019

136,5.0,"Fantastic palace, much more interesting than the larger one!","This is the secondary palace, but has more sections that are authentic and not as rebuilt in the 1980s.  Really gorgeous and also like a nature hike in the middle.  The Secret Garden is a must-do part of the visit. The English-speaking guide who was assigned for everyone (you can't walk solo) was terrific, one of the best guides of my Seoul visit.  We found the palace fascinating and gorgeous, and it's not very far from Bukchon.", June 2019

Although there are some sad stories behind the Palace, still it is amazing to know that Koreans preserve their heritage.Read the landmarks placed in every area  so that you'll appreciate more of the structures, the rooms, the gates.The secret garden is a different ticket but it is the most relaxing part of the tour.. You can sense the peaceful vibe of the nature and the calm effect of the ponds near the study area.. There are stories behind every location and it is good to know them also.. You'll learn about Joseon dynasty and how princes and kings walked down the relaxing lane of greenery, and partly of their beliefs and traditions during the tour if you listen well to your guide. English guides have time slots so make sure you know the schedule and be there on time.Old doesn't mean dull, but it is rich in history, and beauty.. If given the chance, I would still go back here.. (on another season.. =)", June 2019
138,4.0,"Beautiful, but also a little lifeless","A very beautifully decorated and in many ways a spectacular place. Old and full of history. Certainly worth a visit. The secret gardenis nice, but on the guided tour, which you must take to visit, you see mainly small temples and buildings, while the garden itself is really more a densely grown park. A little dissapointing. As is the palace surroundings which really are just grass and gravel. Very little you can see of the interior of the palace, so it is relatively quickly done unless you have a strong interest in 17c Korean architecture.", July 2019
139,4.0,Famous for its secret garden,"This is one of the main palaces of the Joseon Dynasty. It is the most well-preserved, with many structures, gates, rooms, halls and pavilions. The palace is famous for its rear secret (Huwon) garden. A separate ticket is required to visit the rear garden and must join a 90 mins guided tour. The vast garden was a resting place for the royal family and is beautifully landscaped in a way that held on to the original nature of the space. The garden was kept as natural as possible. There are many pavilions, pond and greenery that occupy the compound.I purchased the palace combo ticket, 10,000 won, which entitles to visit 4 palaces and the Jogmyo shrine.", June 2019

143,3.0,Don’t visit on a hot day!,"I’d premise this with the fact it was an exceptionally hot and humid day we visited Changdeokgung palace which definitely impacted our enjoyment. The gardens are the main reason to visit and they are lovely (no flowers, all trees and greenery when we went in June - well maintained) but I would say beyond walking around the gardens, there wasn’t much to do. The entry price was only 1,000 won which is cheap but for that you can’t get inside any of the buildings and when it is hot, it’s a bit relentless.So in short I’d recommend a short visit but not on a hot day.", June 2019

150,5.0,The main sight to see in Seoul,Must see part of any visit to Seoul..in fact the main attraction. Many Asian and Korean visitors hire traditional dress for the visit which adds to the spectacle. There is a guard changing ceremony you can view at around 10.30A.M so time your visit...lasts around 15 minutes. Leave max two hours for a good tour around and as always best to visit with a guide to get the most of the history. Very modern and clean restrooms on site as well as a decent cafe. Some great views of the temple with the mountain backdrop., June 2019
151,4.0,Secondary Palace,"Following the Japanese Invasion both the first and main Gyeongbokgung Palace and this secondary palace were destroyed, but Changdeokgung Palace was rebuilt quickly and then became the main palace. This unique Korean palace was built in harmony with the landscape and is a true beauty. I did not go to the Secret Gardens though. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Walking thru both Palaces and the Bukchon Hanbok Village will take up much of your day so it's best to get an early start and then head to Insadong Street to browse and eat. These are some of the best sites to see in this section of Seoul.", March 2019
152,5.0,Beautiful architectural designs and garden,"Visited with the student volunteers from Meteor Youth. The palace grounds are beautiful and the official hall with the emperor seat is stunning. Do make sure you book the tour for the secret garden. I would recommend you do the 90 mins tour of the secret garden first then visit the palace after. The gardens situated behind the grounds of the palace is huge and boasts many pavilions with beautiful ornate carvings, each with a different design. Do note that the tour entails a lot of walking uphill so be prepared. Another thing to note is that entrance to the secret garden and palace requires different ticket. The palace tickets also have different timings ie day ticket and evening tickets. I was glad I went with the student volunteers as they were able to provide commentary throughout the visit.", June 2019
153,5.0,Worth the visit,"This was the second palace I visited and it was the better of the 2. It was ready to get to. I arrived at 9 and it was a great time for picture taking before the crowds. Later school children showed up and it was a lot busier. I took the free English your at 10:15 and paid for the secret garden tour at 11:30. I suggest you take the garden tour, well worth it. There are his to climb, so be aware. You can opt to return to the palace ground before the more strenuous party of the tour.", June 2019
154,5.0,Soak in the beautiful architecture,Visited this place while wearing Hanbok and hence got a free entrance. It is smaller than the Gyeongbukgung palace but it is also very well kept and maintained. One of the highlights of this palace would be the secret garden tour which is highly recommended! Do remember to book/reserve the tickets online prior to visiting the palace to avoid disappointment as it can get very popular. Would advise going earlier in the day to avoid the sun and people to get good photos :)Tour was fun and we saw the harvesting festival with Koreans dressed in the traditional costumes celebrating the harvesting season. Definitely worth going!, June 2019
155,5.0,Well-preserved palace,"We were glad that we were able to join the guided tour in English of the Secret Garden at the back portion of this palace and to learn more about Korean History and life of royals, and how the palace was used.

156,5.0,Fascinating,The different palaces and the Korean architecture is very fascinating. Very beautiful place and it feels like travelling to the past as I was walking and seeing different palaces., June 2019
157,5.0,Favourite Palace ,This is one of the most visually beautiful palaces to visit in Seoul. Not only are the structure stunning from the outside with their beautifully painted motifs but the insides are stunning as well including some interesting furnished pieces. Make sure you book tickets for the secret garden ahead of time as it can only be done via a guided tour. It was the highlight of our visit. It is nice to visit via tour as there are less people making the experience more relaxed and it’s easier to take photos with no one in them., June 2019
158,3.0,My expectation was too high..,I think my expectation was way too high and the day I visited was a cold day without much sun. That's why I was little disappointed and it would have been so much better if the day was warmer and brighter., April 2019
159,3.0,Ok,"Not bad but doesn't compare to the temples elsewhere in South East Asia. Its expansive lots of areas to explore but no magic ""wow"" moments!", May 2019
160,5.0,Beautiful garden,"The palace is very nice, but the garden is so much nicer. Lots of trees, so a nice place to visit on a hot day. Entering the garden is kinda weird. You have to buy a ticket for a specific time and only at that time you can enter the garden, even though the sign at the garden entrance says you can just go in on your own. You can choose to do a guided tour or walk around on your own.", May 2019
161,5.0,Oasis,"Missed the flowers in season, but still a huge and great palace to visit. Lots of space and greenery. You can pay and go into the secret garden but the next tours were booked so we didn’t bother waiting hours", May 2019
162,5.0,Great few hours with family ,This is a great place to visit lots of history right in front of you perfectly preserved for tourists and Koreans who want to visit the local palaces. There are many palaces in Seoul but this is a very nice one which really is nicely preserved and is super easy to navigate though. There paths are not good for people with mobility issues and I don’t think you could get a wheelchair in here. There is very little share and there is nothing in the palace to drink so make sure you bring water along. Great for all members of the family of all ages. Get yourself a hanbok and have a really traditional  experience, May 2019
163,5.0,Not the biggest but maybe the prettiest of all palaces in Seoul,"This palace is not smaller than Gyeongbokgung, but with the secret garden maybe the most beautiful one. Still always many tourists and local people, but not as crowded as Gyeongbokgung. Many photogenic spots, quiete enough to make good interesting instagram photos.", May 2019
164,2.0,Underwhelming,"It’s unclear what, if anything, is the original structure. It has been reconstructed with bits from another palace which makes it all seem a bit pointless, especially since they point out that  many structures were modified in the process. Is this really what the palace looked like? And what parts are original, from the other palace, or new from the restoration which began in the 1990’s?You can’t go into any of the ”historical” buildings (from the 1990’s..?) which means you only see exteriors and the occasional glance through and open window or door. There is very little written information in English (or any other language for that matter). To enter the garden you have to join the English speaking guided tour which only runs 3-4 times a day, and since it’s a limited number of people per tour, chances are likely that you won’t get tickets unless you booked in advance. Although I can’t say I’m terribly disappointed in not getting a spot for the garden since I wasn’t very impressed with the palace to begin with. I wouldn’t recommend this one.", May 2019
165,4.0,Moonlight Tour on 28th Apr,Glad that we sign up for this moonlight tour. The atmosphere at night was so different from the day where it was much more peaceful except that it can be quite scary if you're walking alone. It's so beautiful at night walking around with a lantern on hand. Get to see more of it and understand better from the guided tour despite having tour this place in the last trip., April 2019
166,4.0,Palace with Historical of its Past,Is good place to have an look of their historical past which i wonder why the area is quite small in compare with palaces in other countries.Good photo taking with modern building surrounding the palace, April 2019
167,4.0,Authentic Korean Architecture,"One of my focus when I travel is to see and feel authentic architecture of the country that I travel to. But my wife has a different reason why we have to get into this palace, and it’s the Secret Garden, because that’s where her favorite Korean soap opera stories are based on. It’s like a time travel for her, and she can’t stop telling me the whole plot of the story where the scene was shoot on the very ground where we were standing on....all I have to do is agree to all of it.Take note of the schedules of the tour once inside because they offer it in different languages. The whole site is amazing, but half a day is good enough then you can move on to one of the Hanok villages nearby so that you can have a good comparison of how the royalties and the the common people live their lives. Do the tours yourself, the sites are just a short taxi ride from your hotel if you are around Meongdong area.", June 2018
168,4.0,Beautiful palace!!,"I came here to see history and culture of Korea. I really enjoyed it. The palace is beautiful, and there are things, like crafts to do around the area.", September 2018
169,4.0,Nice palace,Went after lunch and was not as crowded as the other palaces. Unfortunately the secret garden was closed. Still lots of things to see., April 2019
170,5.0,New impression,"I visited Changdoeokgung  palace at night. it;'s special event for Spring and Autumn only. if you love history then don't miss this event. I saw new atmosphere of palace under the light that was decorated for make each building look outstanding and attractive. there is many history about this place, but this time concept of this event it's about a prince in joeson dynasty who had many talent and very romance. story of him was remake to drama. anyway when walk to inside at night feel like to back to jeoson's time", September 2018
171,5.0,"Worth the visit, traditional palace",if you can rent a traditional outfit from the stores near by and wonder around like a local. It will help you appreciate the atmospher being recreated., April 2019
172,4.0,2nd to Gyeongbokgung Palace,"in my own opinion, 2nd to Gyeongbokgung palace. there is a guided tour to the secret garden and you can book online. there is also a night tour of this Palace.", May 2019
173,4.0,Our second best sightseeing in Seoul,"Palace is just nice and interesting, but the walk in the secret garden is value added to it. In reality, you can enter only with a guided tour but you can after first longer stop take your own route!", May 2019
174,4.0,Good palace to visit,"I enjoyed my visit of Changdeokgung palace, however I do prefer Gyeongbokgung palace personally. Of course the secret garden was the best part about this palace and for me, the main reason for going. Worth a visit!", May 2019
175,4.0,Great place to go for a walk,not too bigyou can spend a time for 1-2 hour to walk aroundthere is a garden that you have to go with tour guidein autumn it may very beatiful, April 2019
176,5.0,Well preserved site that shows beautiful Korea as it was in the past.,"Our family went there as part of a group tour. I strongly suggest you get a guide or someone who is well versed in the palace's history. Seeing the place without knowing its history or ties to Korean culture is such a sad experience. And of course, there are so many places to walk around and gets pictures. From architecture, flora, staff in traditional costumes among others.We didn't get to rent or walk around in traditional korean clothes. That would have been awesome and probably the only downside we experienced of our visit.", June 2018
177,5.0,The Secret Garden is awesome!,"Very nice palace grounds, with the bonus of the (pay extra) secret garden. Free tour makes the visit more meaningful.", May 2019
178,5.0,Great sense of history,Went to the Palace with the group but I didn't get enough time to look at everything so I went back on my own few days later. There was some dancing and  the changing of the guards which was very colorful and noisy and very very interestingThete was also a very well presented publication which was free  about the Palace. Many of the people there were in  traditional costumes. There is no charge to go in. The Folk Park is located just up the street in the same area the admission us 3.000 won into the Palace from there but if you wear the traditional costume  the price for admission is free.Go to the folk park first and then the palaces. It is a good half day of exploring in wonderful surroundings., May 2019
179,5.0,Historical Korean Palace,"If you’re looking for a little history with beautiful scenery where kids can run around, this place is for you. Lots of tourists rent old Korean royalty costumes and explore the grounds like that, taking pictures. It’s relaxing and very pretty, signage is also in English but you could rent a live or audio tour if you want to learn more. A budget-friendly enjoyable experience.", March 2019
180,4.0,Beautiful Palace,"It was not so crowded as I went on weekday. Too bad the main entrance ticket didn't include entry to the secret garden, so didn't go in.", April 2019
181,4.0,Beautiful palace,"The place was beautiful, it was big and we weren't able to go around the whole place. There was a different payment for the palace itself and the secret garden, we decided not to go inside anymore as there were a lot of people in line for the tickets. It's a must-see if you love watching history K-dramas.", April 2019
182,4.0,Decent palace,decent palace with a few guards outside. dint visit inside in particular since we had been to the biggest palace in seoul, April 2019
183,5.0,Lovely palace and gardens,This is the prettiest of Seoul's palaces and alot of it has to do with the secret gardens which is the highlight. Make sure you go on a guided tour as I think it makes the place come alive more when you understand the use of the buildings and the history of the Korean monarchy., April 2019
184,2.0,over crowded with tourists,the hanbok renting opposite the palace offers worst experience for us for their services. did not recommend, April 2019
185,5.0,Beautiful Korean Palace in the Middle of Seoul,"If you have a half day, I would highly recommend this place for a visit.  First time that I have visited this outstanding Korean Palace.  Lots of great places to take that Korea picture to send back home.  The old style of Korea past is all around you.  The government has done a great job in saving this jewel for all time.  My wife told me that not all of the grounds were not always open to the public.Just my thoughts: You will need at 3 or 4 hours to see most of the grounds.Wear your tennis shoes (loose gravel and uneven stairs).Even though it says handicap accessible, most of the palace is not set up for wheelchairs.You will also have problems with the kids stroller.Plenty of toilets throughout the grounds.Anyways, bring the camera and have a great time (we did)!", April 2019
186,5.0,Another must-see palace,"This palace comprises many different buildings and squares, all very photogenic. With limited time, I visited the queen's buildings. Well worth a longer stay", April 2019
187,5.0,Greenhouse - museum - Palace,"Nice place to see and understand about Korea architecture. Starting from the gate which  oposite the main gate of Green House, to the Museum and then straight to the palce. Incredible about the culture and structure of Korea", April 2019
188,5.0,The Best of Five Grand Palaces in Seoul,"Changdeokgung is divided into two major complexes, the palace complex and the secret garden complex. Each has its own tickets. The free entry perk of wearing hanbok (Korean traditional clothings) does not apply to Changdeokgung's secret garden. You still have to buy the ticket to get into the garden.Perhaps because it was used as some sort of recreational lodge, Changdeokgung is constructed in a more scenic relax fashion than other palaces. I would say this is the Korean version of Versailles.The rear garden has several interesting stops, but it will take quite an effort to walk down its hilly path. It definitely some stamina as the guide walk you roughly 1.5km up and down path. The garden is an GUIDED TOUR only section, you can't enter it alone. Make sure you check its schedule before you go.The ideal duration to wander around at Changdeokgung, including its rear garden, can be 2hr 30 minutes. Its garden tour itself can last around 1hr 30minutes, spare yourself another one full hour to enjoy its palace complex. It is quite a spectacle as well.Best time to visit Changdeokgung is early April (Spring, the cherry blossom season), and Autumn.", April 2019
189,4.0,Beautiful Palace,I came here around 9.30 am and it wasn't crowded. The entrance ticket is 3000 Won for palace only and 5000 Won if it's include the ''Secret Garden'' area. The design is not too different with Gyeongbokgung Palace but nice to spend some time here., April 2019
190,4.0,Walk around the garden,Well for my opinion after I have been to Gyeongbokgung the shape of the building look similar design. It's very nice to walk around the garden right next to the palace wall., April 2019
191,5.0,Fun and interesting,"Seoul is an interesting historic city.  James, our guide, was very personable and fit our interests perfectly.  He grew up in a small village after the Korean conflict and shared plenty of local details that few tourists ever know.  The palace tour with the changing of the guards in costume was very entertaining.  The walking tour of Seoul was fun, and the personal tour of the small Education Museum truly touching.", April 2019
192,5.0,Changdeokgung & Secret Garden ,It's the secondary palace used during the Joseon Dynasty and the Secret Garden is a must to visit as it's open at limit time for visitors only.It's worth to visit and understand the information provided by the guide. It's a good time to explore during Spring from my view as the weather is great walking around the palace as I have great interest in the history of Korea., April 2019
193,1.0,Historical Palace,"One of the attraction to visit, it is also close to shopping area and night market, close to train station and underground shopping area.", April 2019
194,4.0,SEE IT!,Inexpensive and fascinating. All the local palaces are a great place to visit. You get to see some pretty gardens and people dressed in authentic outfits., April 2019
195,5.0,Visit at night,The palace is open after dark which lends a whole new experience to palace visits. The lake is illuminated and it's fun to watch all the kids with lanterns., April 2019
196,5.0,Loved It,"Definitely a must see. We got lucky and managed to get tickets for the secret garden tour at the ticket box the morning we visited. This palace has an extensive history. There are a lot of historical and architectural elements that can be overlooked or missed so I would definitely recommend a guide or tour on first visit, but it is easy to appreciate the beauty of the place without one.", April 2019
197,5.0,First Rate,"This is an excellent large site with some nicely restored buildings. It looks particularly good in April with the cherry blossom and the azaleas. The visit to the Secret Garden is the icing on the cake, although my visit was marred by the group being too large, with young people in period dress (nice touch),,,but they were too noisy and wanting to take selfies all the time. The Palace, like the others is free to 65+, but the garden costs, and it best to book on line to ensure a place.", April 2019
198,3.0,Okay: but I’ve probably seen too many palaces,"Caveat to this review is I’ve likely seen too many palaces over the years, and nothing in this one stands out. What also detracts from the experience is that all the buildings were only built within the last 150 years as the originals were destroyed. So you are seeing fairly modern materials and construction techniques. It feels a bit staged as a result. If you’re short on time and have seen an Asian palace before then you can afford to skip this one.Final point: ‘the secret garden’ can only be accessed via the scheduled tours, which appear to depart every 2 hours. I didn’t do it.", April 2019
199,5.0,One of the Biggest Palaces,Never been to a Palace before. But this place is worth the visit.The area is just so vast and you can see a lot of  tourists on their hanbok dresses., April 2019
200,5.0,Unesco heritage and much calmer,This palace is one of the Joseon Dynasty king's favorite and it is much beautiful and calmer than Gyeongbokgung since it is near the secret garden. It is the only palace in Seoul that has granted UNESCO World Heritage., April 2019
201,4.0,Visit markets and other tourists areas,Visited area and noticed this site  lucky with weather today. Cool but no rain.  Access to site is by underground in area (line 2 green line) with both bus and taxi access easy.  Lots of restaurants and other eating houses around area. Good market in area., April 2019
202,5.0,Beautiful palace and Secret Garden is a must see!,We visited this this palace on a rainy day but this didn’t take anyway any of the beauty only some of the crowds! A big palace with some beautiful buildings to explore. Our highlight was the Secret Garden tour. We reserved this early as we heard it gets booked up fast! The tour is 90 minutes but so worth it. The gardens are so peaceful and well preserved and our English tour guide gave a thorough history and 5-10 minutes at each stop to wander and take our own pictures. We would definitely recommdend a visit!, April 2019
203,4.0,Nicer than Gyeongbokgung,"If you only have time for ONE palace, choose this one. It is more expansive -- has more trees and more structures. Better to book the secret garden tour ahead (esp. if you prefer the English tour) so that you plan your visit accordingly.", April 2019
204,3.0,Similar to the other places,"Lots of building but all of the same decor, A lot of the place was destroyed by the Japanese and been refurbished. Still worth a walk around expect to spend around an hour. Changdeokgung place is adjacent to Changgyonggung Place with an inter connecting gate, there is an entrance fee for both places. So ideal to tie in at the same time. Over 65's have free entry on proof of age to both place.You can pay extra and have a guided tour of the secret garden which takes around 1.5 hours.", March 2019
205,5.0,Beautiful and picturesque,We decided to stroll through the gardens in full Hanbok.  We rented them from the little shop across the traffic lights from the front gate.  15000KW for 2 hours.We then wandered the palace grounds (free entry) taking pictures.  We were also asked to be in many other pictures from other tourists as we have very blond hair and blue eyes.   It was a great experience.The gardens were beautiful with Cherry Blossom blooming everywhere along the pathways. Well worth the visit., March 2019
206,5.0,Look around the Palace where royal families once lived.,You stroll around all the buildings and rooms where Royal family members once lived together with their own garden which is very unique in Korean garden design. You can go there via Metro line #3: Ankook station from where it takes 10 minutes' walk., October 2018
207,5.0,Pleasant palace,"This is a lovely palace to walk around. Lots of things to see. It will only take you about and hour. You can dress up in national costume if you like, at a cost of course. Pretty gardens as well.", March 2019
208,4.0,Don’t miss this,"Nearly didn’t come as we were already so tired from previous days including an earlier visit to Gyeongbokgung. Boy, am I glad I came! This to me is more beautiful and felt more authentic than Gyeongbokgung. As there were less visitors , we were able to wander around quietly at our pace. There also seemed to be better signages and explanation of the various venues at Changdeokgung. However some places were closed for renovation/ restoration. Could feel the weight of history on this place and to me, it felt sad and desolate. Did not manage to see the Secret Garden but will do so next time.", March 2019

212,3.0,"Beautiful palance, but very similar to all other asian palaces or temples","If you’re into temples, palaces, history, parks, or a slower pace, head over to Changdeokgung Palace. Surrounded by modern skyscrapers, the palace built in 1405 feels like a time machine once you step through the large gates. The old architectural features have been maintained and you’re able to freely walk anywhere to get a glimpse of life behind the palace walls. Tickets are cheap at <$5 USD per person. The palace open from 10am to 6pm. This destination is kid friendly.", April 2018

223,4.0,Walking Tour in Seoul,"Our walking tour of the secret garden in 昌德宫 was really enjoyable. We registered on-line to get the 10.00am slot. The weather was fantastic because it had been raining the day before. Besides the Autumn colors of the tress, our well experience tour guide told us stories and history of those traditional buildings. Our stay in insadong also gave us great convenience we can just take a 15 minutes healthy morning walk to the ticketing office of the Palace and the secret garden.", November 2018
224,4.0,Worthwhile visit with beautiful gardens,"After Gyeonbokgung, this is considered the second most important palace from the Joseon Dynasty.

225,5.0,Must see,"I visited on a public holiday and admission was free (!) which was a nice surprise, considering there are not many things that are free in this world. The changing of the guards was mind blowing.  The Seoul Tourism Board tries hard to give tourists what they want in order to boost this revenue stream.", February 2019
226,5.0,Yolanda Jones ,We went as part of half day tour of Seoul. The changing of the guard was a spectacle and all the people in traditional dress was something to behold. Our guide Jenifer was a very friendly person with good knowledge of the attractions we visited. Well worth a visit, January 2019
227,5.0,Moonlight Tour is awesome!,"今年秋天終於排上日程，剛好可以參加古宮的夜間導覽。＊注意!外國人只有周日場次。我提前一個月上網買票，因為聽說很熱門，有時可能搶不到票。前些年已經去過兩次昌德宮，但這是第一次夜間參觀，氣氛格外不同，安靜、神秘、美好。英文導覽員的英文很好，說得不多，但很清楚。記得一定要早點報到，因為是所有隊伍一齊在門外集合，等門開了才會魚貫進入。(自己腦補: 等待的時候有點像古代朝臣在宮門外等候上朝的那種感覺^^)其實夜間能看到的古蹟特色比較少，畢竟天色已暗。但另有一股韻味(不透露太多，才能好好體會)。雖然收費較高，但包含一場很不錯的國樂與舞蹈等表演，還有小小點心盒。*注意: 入秋後首爾日夜溫差大，整場tour都在戶外，若當天剛好遇上低溫冷鋒之類的，建議帽子、圍巾、手套都戴上。*景福宮也有夜間參訪，買票時記得看清楚是景福宮(星光紀行)還是昌德宮(月光紀行)。兩者內容稍有不同，票價與時間長短也有差異。I visited this palace twice before during daytime. This was my first Moonlight Tour to this ancient palace. It provided a different feel when walking in the quiet night. Open your ears and eyes, for there's music and performance. * This tour is only offered in a limited period ever spring and autumn. For foreigners, only Sunday nights are available, so plan your tour ahead if you're interested. * If you want to really see the beauty of architecture, visit during daytime -- it's really dark during this Moonlight Tour so you won't be able to see much palace features. * They would give you an earphone guide-set and a lantern to light your way. The English guide spoke good English. Note: The more famous palace -Gyeongbokgung- has a nighttime tour too, called Starlight Tour. There's some difference in the content of these two tours. In sum, this Tour is totally worthwhile, and it provides a unique experience. Keep warm, though, for temperatures could drop suddenly in spring/autumn nights in Seoul. Arrive early to check-in -- all visitors would lineup and wait for the gate to open and enter all-together. You can purchase online beforehand. The tickets could sometimes be sold out since this is a popular tour.", October 2018
228,5.0,English Tour of palace and Secret Garden,Arrive early to buy tickets (or buy on-line) and catch the English Tour (other languages are available at different times). Be sure to also buy tickets for the Secret Garden extension., February 2018
229,4.0,Seoul Visit,One of the best place to visit in Seoul whilst you are in South Korea. Visiting this Changdeokgung Palace gives you a nostalgic taste and sights of how Korean Palace in the past looks like with the special carvings on the layers of roof tops. Wonderful place to enjoy South Korea, September 2018
230,5.0,Eyes catching for Autum!!!,"I visit during peak autumn and bought a secret garden entrance ticket..to my expectation, its was worth the money! the scenery was extremely stunning! you can see the leaves from green, yellow, red and dark red scattered around the palace and the architecture is also gorgeous!", November 2018
231,5.0,Glorious Palace,The history of this place is incredible.  It is massive and we had a wonderful English language tour that gave us some extensive information on how the royals lived over the centuries.  It is hard to believe that the palace was occupied until only 30 years ago.  The palace is well worth a visit and I encourage anyone visiting to take the time to join a tour to really learn how the Joseon lived.The grounds were glorious in the autumn., October 2018
232,4.0,Quiet palace,"Seoul has a few royal palaces. Changdeokgung was in use far into the 20th century. The thing with these palaces is; once you have seen one, you have pretty much seen them all. When you visit Seoul for the first time I certainly wouldn’t recommend to go see all palaces. One, two max, is more than enough. Changdeokgung is perfect for a quiet stroll on a lazy Sunday afternoon. From the back gate you can walk straight into Changgyeonggung palace. These two palaces are a haven of peace in busy Seoul. Enjoy.", January 2019
233,4.0,"Crowded during the summer, but still good!",This place was really cool - but would have appreciated it more if there were less people around! It was nice seeing an actual palace and the place was really huge! We only stayed here less than an hour because we had to return our hanboks. When you visit here it would be better if you have at least 2 hours so you can explore and enjoy the entire area! Also it would be a lot better to plan coming here not on a peak season like summer to avoid the crowd!, June 2018
234,5.0,Fabulous experience,"Wonderful palace with much to see and do, and with a multitude of photo opportunities. Beautifully kept grounds.", October 2018
235,3.0,Not much ,I think palaces at South Korea are just average. We wanted to go to the secret garden but didn’t know you have to buy the tickets no later than 20 mins before the tour starts. There’s also no food & I was starving., January 2019
236,4.0,Fascinating,"You need to go with the free guided tour they provided, otherwise I don’t think you will enjoy it that much. The structure looks practically the same and there are so many small doors leading to small streets that you may get lost in it. But I like this one better than the gyeongbokgung, maybe because not so many people visiting it so not that crowded, you can really enjoy the scenery and imagine how the life’s like there when it’s still used by the royal family.", January 2019
237,3.0,A Visit to Changdeokgung Palace,"This palace is highly recommended to visit in Korea. However, my family and I found nothing special about the visit since all structures look alike and tourists cannot go inside the palace except hanging around the areas outside.", December 2018
238,5.0,Graceful of Korea,"Feel the uniqueness of beauty in Korea that does not seek glamor.

239,4.0,A nice stroll,A group of eight from young old to elderly having fun in admiring the spacious and tranquil palace. As we didn't have enough time  so we missed the famous Secret Garden. However we love the architectural structure and the special atmosphere., November 2018
240,4.0,Worth of visit,"This is one of ""similar"" places in Seoul. There are five or six places where the previous emperors have lived. Not a big difference, but the colors are a little bit different and the locations are different. Take a guided tour if possible and you'll learn more. Seniors get some discount, but you need to keep the passports with you to show your age.", November 2018
241,5.0,A historical walk,I would suggest to go as tour then you will understand the historical value at the back of it. You will know how and why the palace is designed in certain way...Understand how people see the time in the old days... where is the king seated.., December 2018

243,5.0,Beautiful Secret Garden,It snowed the day we went and it went on quite heavily the whole morning. Secret Garden of Changdeokgung was completely covered in snow. It was a beautiful sight though VERY COLD. Our tour guide was wonderful and patient in explaining the gardens and architecture. Completely worth the visit. Especially the snowy landscapes!, December 2018
244,4.0,Changdeokgung Palace during winter.,I have not seen the palace during other seasons but I prefer to see it during spring or fall.There is a certain charm to the place and gives you an insight on how the kings and the princesses lived their lives centuries ago.There are rentals availble where you can wear costume which will seal your visit.Tells a lot about Korea and its heritage., December 2018
245,4.0,Walking Through History,"I can only imagine just how large the grounds are until you visit the location. But what we enjoyed the most was the Secret Garden tour. The guide was very knowledgeable about the palace and garden. Because of the time of year that we were there, all of trees had lost most of their leaves and the ponds were partially frozen over. All in all, a worth while event if you are in Seoul.", December 2018
246,5.0,Beautiful ,This historic Palace is a must see. You feel like you are being transported back in time. The changing of the guard ceremony is not to be missed!, December 2018
247,5.0,Gorgeous,I went with my family   We toured the beautiful Palace and enjoyed the grounds and the Authenticity of the Palace, July 2018
248,5.0,Beautiful and Calm,"Changdeokgung (昌德宮) was built in 1412 and served as the secondary royal palace after Gyeongbokgung. The palace was burnt to ground in 1592 but then fully restored in 1618. Unlike Gyeongbokgung which was built on a leveled ground, Chandeokgung was built with better landscape design, with more trees and shrubs.We reached the palace at around 3:15 pm, and spent around 1 hour and a half there. Due to the time constraint, we didn't visit the secret garden. Changdeokgung is smaller compares to Gyeongbokgung, and we are using the same way to go in and and out. Thus we won't miss out any of the hall in the palace.The entrance fee for an adult is KRW 3000. Secret garden is a part of the palace, but we need to pay extra KRW 5000 to enter the garden (the ticket can be bought only at the entrance). Changdeokgung is near to subway Anguk Station (line 3 exit 3).", November 2018
249,5.0,"Ancient Palace, Beautiful to take photos","I and my daughter walk along here, then we go outside from this palace, to  rent Korean dress 15000 Won  and more for rent 1hr or more. Many beautiful dresses with hat, handbags and ribbons.", November 2018
250,5.0,"Beautiful palace, stunning garden","The palace and grounds are both commanding and pleasing to the eye. The secret garden tour was absolutely stunning. It was late November, and there were still leaves on the trees. Gorgeous reds, oranges, golds. Quiet walk with immersive views for contemplation and enjoyment. THE #1 highlight of our visit to Seoul, and there were many.", November 2018
251,4.0,Large World Heritage Site,"Changdeokgung Palace is a large park with many historic building.  Looking on line we saw that the secret garden tour was sold out but we were able to purchase tickets when we arrive at the palace.  During the fall they allow visitors to tour the secret garden on your own, not with the tour.  Great place for photos, many visitors in traditional dress.", November 2018
252,5.0,TOUR!!,Spend the few extra dollars to get the secret garden tour.  Our guide Kim was awesome; she was funny and complimented our Korean., November 2018
253,5.0,Beautiful palace,"I like this much better than Gyeongbokgung, especially because of the Secret Garden tour. And I think it's just the right size to walk around and appreciate each structure.", February 2018
254,4.0,Nice autumn colours,"In autumn, the palace is not as attractive as the best time to go there is late March (Spring time). The main reason for my going there in autumn is to visit firstly this palace and secondly the adjoining Changgyeonggung. From Insa-dong where I usually stay, it is an easy walk to this palace. If you would like to see these two palaces and Gyeongbokgung nearby, it is recommended that you firstly enter Changdeokgung, thence into Changgyeonggung (through its entrance next to the ticket booth, in front of the Secret Garden) and walk back to the front of Changdeokgung.  From there a taxi will take you to Gyeongbokgung in less than 10 minutes (around 3,000 won). I have tried getting a taxi at the far-end exit of Changgyeonggung without success, as the taxi drivers told me to get out (due to wrong traffic directions).I visited the Secret Garden several times and found it not too hard to buy a ticket (of any language session) from the above-mentioned booth, as I am interested only in the scenery and not in long historical narratives. In autumn, Changgyeonggung nearby is more attractive. If you look around, there are many beautiful maple trees.", November 2018
255,3.0,Can be more,"I concentrated on the Secret Garden. The stroll through it during autumn was really nice. After seeing one compound, they all started to look the same. I would have liked to have seen onsite guides as to what i'm looking at, i.e. living quarters, bedroom, office.", November 2018
256,3.0,Nice grounds history,"This is a good place for a walk on the beautiful grounds. Fall time made for nice colors in photos. the buildings are nice, but the real interesting part is the changing of the guard on the top of the hour. it's free and nice to see.", November 2018
257,5.0,secret guarden,visit this palace to tour the huwon secret garden at an extra 5000W price. The gardens are quiet and beautiful., November 2018
258,5.0,My Favorite Palace Visited,"Changdeokgung Palace was my favorite palace visited on my trip to Seoul. I was here later in the day after visiting Gyeongbokgung and it was far less crowded and more peaceful. The scale is much smaller, but prettier I think. Many of the buildings here were open for display, so you can see what the rooms looked like. There are so many buildings and small paths to walk around here, you can get lost. I did not do the private gardens, I will keep that for next time. The entrance price was cheap and this palace was easy to get to. If you don't have time to visit all the palaces, I recommend visiting Changdeokgung Palace.", October 2018
259,5.0,Well located park and temple,It is a temple where you mind find some Korean culture inspirations if you have time worth having a look, November 2018
260,5.0,Rainy Fall Day,We came when it was raining the entire day. The palace was beautiful but the rain made it hard to walk because the floor is sand. People come here to see the garden. But you will need to get tickets in advance. It is a separate payment from the entrance fee because it has a separate tour. It's 3000 won but free for children under 6 and seniors 65 above. It's definitely a good place to visit in the fall because of all the trees and probably during the spring., November 2018
261,5.0,Amazing insight into Korean history + do the Secret Garden!,"UNESCO World Heritage-listed, this palace will make you feel like you are in old Korea. As soon as you step inside, it's as if the madness of modern Seoul has gone - everything is quiet, beautiful, and peaceful. I 100% recommend the guided tours (English ones offered twice a day) as without them it'd be hard to understand the history of the place. Our guide was excellent and we enjoyed listening to her. The highlight of our visit was by far the Secret Garden. While it says you HAVE to enter with a tour, once you buy your ticket and go in they give you the option of a 'self guided tour' or a 'guided tour' - if you choose the first option you can just walk around on your own, which is what we did. It was beautiful! Nothing like a walk in the park to see real Korea.", November 2018
262,5.0,Palace & secret garden,"One of those 5 palace in seoul. Beautiful architecture and lots of joseon kingdom history. This palace is full of visitors and tourist. If given a chance, secret garden tour is a must to visit where it was once a secret recreation place for the royalty. Beautiful and full of red leaves in autumn season.", November 2018
263,5.0,Stepping back in time,"When you visit Changdeokgung Palace and find yourself surrounded by its gardens, its structures, and the people dressed in Hanbok, that is exactly how you will feel. You can almost imagine what it would be like to be a resident of this palace back in the 1400s.I would suggest getting to Changdeokgung Palace earlier during the day, so as not to be surrounded by too many tourists and visitors. That way, you can immerse yourself in the calm environment and feel a sense of ease and serenity. It will just be you, the palace, and the few birds singing in the distance.", February 2018
264,4.0,First time in Seoul!,Beautiful and stunning palace with the autumn leaves! Go with tour guide to the Huwon and learn about the history of the palace. Nice place for a stroll!, November 2018
265,5.0,Big Palace ,"This palace had several entry points. We had to line up a bit for the tickets. There were so many tourists inside. This time, we did not have a guided tour.The palace was simple but beautiful but it was quite hard to find a quiet spot. The grounds were huge and the trees were beautiful during our autumn visit.", November 2018
266,5.0,Magical palace,"On a beautiful cool crisp fall afternoon in Seoul, my wife and I visited this palace and we were so glad we did. We’ve always visited Kyungbok Palace but I have not visited this palace and boy were we glad. We followed a Korean guide and he was excellent with so many stories about each of the rooms and rich histories that brought the entire palace to life. It is such a sad place as well as it was where our last King was forced to sign the treaty with Japan early 1900s.  Also, when Japan took over Korea, they try to make mockery of our history by making the kings palace a zoo until few  the dacades ago Korean government got rid of the zoo and restored the palace to current glory.  The story of a king’s love for one of his wife and the house he built for her. The persimmon tree in front of this house was full of grown persimmons that hung from the skinny branches screaming for to be plucked for consumption but we could not. The afternoon was just perfect not only to experience the amazing architecture but to learn about the Korean history as well. I highly recommend to follow a guide for the full experience. Go there and you won’t regret it.", November 2018

268,5.0,Beautiful,We spent a lovely sunny afternoon exploring the Palace and its grounds whilst in Seoul.  There were lots of things to see and even though it was bustling with tourists it felt peaceful to walk around., October 2018
269,4.0,Very pretty in fall,"We did not take a tour as they were all full when we got there. The buildings and the grounds are very pretty, however, they all do start to look the same if you have no idea what you are looking at. I would recommend waiting to take the guided tour if you can't speak the language so that you can appreciate what you are looking at.", November 2018
270,4.0,Beautiful Architecture,"The architecture is mesmerizing. Even can relate to China and Japan's architectures, still it has its own identity", December 2017
271,5.0,The summer garden,"It was created in mid 1300. The secret garden was a place intended to allow royal family members to relax. The venue was used for a wide variety-of entreatment activities, including-archery contests. Te secret garden is about 69% of the entire venue. Beautiful place home of a 350 year old tree...it is place to visit more than once not inly because it will enrich your soul but because the nature is full of wonderful details difficult to capture all at once.", November 2018
272,4.0,Another lovely complex,"Walking around the buildings and the grounds is great.  After a while, the temples and palaces all start to look alike, but this one is certainly worth a visit.", November 2018
273,5.0,Great choice if you only want to see one palace,"Since most of the palaces are very similar, this is the one to pick because of its secret garden. You need timed tickets to get in to the secret garden and its mandatory to have a palace tour guide for the garden. It's actually a summer retreat mini village, and there are many charming buildings to explore in the secret garden. The palace buildings are beautiful, always remember to look up at the elaborate painting on the ceilings. You don't need a guide for the palace proper. The raised walkway going in was reserved for the king, while the lower left paved part of the walkway was for the military only, and the lower right paved part of the walkway was for the court ladies only, who numbered about one thousand. We did hire a guide for the day who also took us to Joygesa Buddhist Temple, and we were glad we did. The big aged brass buckets that are near buildings were actually fire extinguishers of the day. They were full of water at all times, holding about 20 gallons. You will be warned endlessly that the secret garden is very physically challenging which I would disagree with. There are hills, but the climb is gradual. I have bad knees and had no trouble with it. This was the second of the palaces built in Seoul, which happened every time the shaman felt bad luck was on the way, so they would build a new palace to escape misfortune. Very beautiful place, and definitely the one to pick if you only have the time or inclination to visit one palace.", October 2018
274,5.0,Picked best time of the year to visit ,"We came here as a recommendation from a local. The Secret Back Garden is a must visit, additional entrance fee. The fall foliage makes the garden so picturesque. Worth a morning visit.", November 2018
275,4.0,Very interesting place,Need to spend a few hours to take it all in. To see how the rulers in every society have lived so much better than everyone else is very telling. Pretty sure I could have be a really good ruler., December 2017
276,5.0,Beautiful Secret Garden ,"The palace itself is still okay. The gyeongbokgung palace is more grand than this.But the best part of this palace is the secret garden. I visited during autumn Nov 2019, it was beautiful as it truly shows the colour of autumn. My guide told me that the tickets to secret garden is not easy to get. Even he has to go pretty early to get them. This is the place we tried on the hanbok. There's 1 hanbok rental shop right across the street over the main gate. Hanbok rental is around 20,000 won and 5,000 won for hairstyles.", November 2018
277,5.0,The highlight of our two weeks in Korea,"Changdeokgung Palace and the Secret Garden were the highlight of our two week trip to Korea. The buildings, the gardens, everything was so beautiful. The mix of preservation and reconstruction has been done beautifully. We were here for two hours, that was enough time to see all of the secret garden and most of the palace buildings. The secret garden tour is 100% worth the effort to get tickets. We booked online six days in advance. The online booking has a quirk, they don't email you your tickets, instead you need to save them as a pdf, print that out & take it to the ticket office.", October 2018
278,5.0,amazing.. amazing place,this was one of the best places that I ever saw. you can also rent a Korean custom and tour the palace along with the old heritage., October 2018

280,5.0,Take the guided tour for secret garden ,I paid 8k won for both the palace entrance and secret garden entrance which comes with guided tour. The garden is a UNESCO heritage sight. Definitely worth a visit... remember to wear comfortable shoes as some parts required going up slopes, October 2018
281,4.0,Beautiful palace with its 'secret garden',"If you are interested to see the autumn leaves in a palace setting, ensure to book the secret garden tour via online which is available one week before the actual date. This palace is not as pack as the Gyeongbukgung & has a nice garden with the autumn colors in place.", October 2018
282,5.0,great cultural experience,"though smaller than its main sister, the Gyeongbok Palace, Changdeok Palace can hold its own. In fact, I'd much prefer Changdeok due to its size (smaller palace ground) but no less beautiful and intricate. It also has Secret Garden palace (you need extra ticket to get in, famed for its beautiful ground and garden). With Changdeok, you got to see buildings and its functionality, its architecture and also history (progression). The colorful walls and ceilings are such a wonder, the neat design of the buildings are a marvel in itself. It's worth a visit for palace, architecture, and historical geek. You can definitely take great pictures in the compound, because there are many great spots to shoot.", October 2018
283,5.0,Cool Temple,"While in Korea or anywhere in Asia, these temples are a great reflection of the past and a window to the future. Simply enjoyable culture found no where else.", October 2018
284,5.0,Autumn 🍁  at the Secret Garden,"I visited this place last spring but I am still  curious about its autumn 🍂 look. I can say that autumn is the best time to visit. It is more relaxing 😎 and refreshing especially to see the foliage of 🌳🌳 🌲 🌲 🍂  🍁 . May be the scenery is more beautiful on the last week of October because the foliage is definitely brighter and more colorful. I went there on the second week of October and some trees started to change and they looked  wonderful. You can choose to stay within the group and listen to the tour guide ,but if you like to explore on your own within the area they allowed, you can do it.", October 2018
285,4.0,Just relax,We miss out the secret garden but overall is a must visit place. Not bad and have a nice photo session but this is not the best palace in Seoul., October 2018
286,5.0,Don't miss the secret garden tour.,"We found Changdeokgung Palace to be the most picturesque of the palaces, with the various building nestled among tress and gardens. You can visit the normal palace grounds at anytime, but it is definitely worth pre-planning and make sure you book the secret garden walking tour as well. It's included in the price, but you need to get a separate ticket (either online or there on the day), but spaces for each tour are limited. You'll also need to check what language each tour is in. However, if you miss you chosen language, it would still be worth it just to see the garden.", October 2018
287,5.0,Autumnal ,Couldn’t get over the colours in the palace Secret Garden! October is clearly the month to visit with stunning foliage everywhere. You can also do special self guided tours at the moment so you can explore at your own pace. My favourite palace that we visited!, October 2018
288,5.0,Secret garden,"The Changdeokgung Palace is a great place to visit, consider purchasing the royal palace pass that includes 4 palaces and the royal shrine for 10,000 (approx $8.80USD).All palaces have an English brochure at the ticket counter.This palace was destroyed and rebuilt in 1610, it was the main palace for about 270 years.Consult your brochure for the times of the Secret garden tour, you can only access the garden through a tour.

But the tour is worth t.", October 2018
292,4.0,Secret Garden (Huwon) tour,"This was the first palace in Seoul we saw due to the Secret garden tour.  Tried to reserve online but it was closed; no problem buying tickets at the door though (you can’t visit the garden without a guided tour.) There’s a fair amount of walking and stairs for outdoors (we were fine, ages 23, 58 & 70) and it was the largest palace garden we saw in Seoul and Kyoto.  The guide was one of the best English speaking guides we heard over 2 weeks: she allowed ample time for photos but kept us moving along (a lot of ground to cover.)", October 2018
293,4.0,A little history with a nice secret garden tour,Nice place to roam around admire the structural and architectural history of Seoul considering this palace offers some structures being built earlier than the other palaces in the surrounding area. The Secret Garden tour provides more access to different areas and also great views. It's a short hike up and down some small hills but definitely worth the extra fee., October 2018
294,5.0,Beauty in Nature reflected in the Buildings,"A place that you must visit in Seoul.If you like history, this site will satisfy you.There are so many buildings & courtyards to view that you will be lost in your own world.The highlight of this historical site however is the Secret Garden appended to the Palace grounds. In fact the area taken up by the Secret Garden is larger that the actual Palace grounds.There is Nature, History and beauty to behold. The tour takes you on a wonderful walk through the grounds. In autumn, with the red, yellow and orange leaves, it is a unforgettable sight.Plan for a visit in either Spring or Autumn.", October 2018
