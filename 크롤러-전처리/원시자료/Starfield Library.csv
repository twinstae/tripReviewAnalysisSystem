1,4.0,Fantastic Library,"I purposely looked for Starfield Library in COEX Mall as I really wanted to see the place in person. Fantastic! That's the right word for me - tall shelves with sooo many books to browse. The library also has tables, chairs and lamps that encourages you to read and relax.

3,4.0,Book Heaven (If You Read Korean),"It's a big library with a great atmosphere, although I don't think this place would be great for studying or even reading as it can be a bit too noisy for some.

5,5.0,Very Impressive Library in the Heart of a Mall.,"The Starfield Library, which is pretty and impressive and beautiful. Two floors library with lots of colors and places to eat. Basically the only highlight of the Starfield COEX Mall which is pretty average.Still at the bottom of the library you will find adults posing with big teddy bears, etc, etc common of the infantile immaturity of South Koreans.But the beauty value of the library is there to be seen and for all to appreciate. Except for the Starfield Library which you can access directly from the streets, the rest of the mall is a waste of pure time.", January 2020

8,4.0,"Impressive library, aesthetically pleasing!","We took the subway to Samseong station (Line 2) to check out the COEX mall.  The mall is huge, with an aquarium, so it took us a while to find the Starfield Library.  It is located opposite the Kakao Friends' store, and when you walk in, it was impressive.

11,4.0,Beautiful Library,"It's not exactly your typical library.  In fact, this library is in the middle of the COEX Mall.  There is a small cafe in the library, and spots to sit and rest, study, read, or work on something.  However, it is not quiet.  It is a tourist spot, and people are continually moving in and out.  As a librarian myself, I thought it was a beautiful place, but as a patron, I would be annoyed with the crowds and the noise.", December 2019
12,5.0,Library Popular with Photographers,"The Starfield Library is very photogenic with its 2 story bookshelf so it attracts a lot of photographers.  We took the Subway (green line) to Samseong Station.  Look for the exit for COEX and you will find the library.  The library is inside a big mall with lots of other shops and restaurants.  You will see people riding the escalator multiple times to get a good picture.  So if you want a photo with no one, you will have to wait awhile.", January 2020

14,5.0,Wonderful space to visit for a few hours,"This place has got to be one of the most lovely and unexpected spaces to find in a shopping mall. Located in the huge mall on the main Gangnam boulevards, this Staffield Library is the focal point of one section of the mall, towering nearly 3 storey. The cafe located amongst all the volume of beautiful book shelves on their upper floor (on top of the escalators) serves excellent cakes, coffee and has an outdoor space to catch some sun on cool winter days.", November 2019
15,3.0,Tall Bookshelves for Phototaking,"It is really nice to see tall bookshelves in the middle of the mall, and mainly it is for phototaking. Books there are mainly in Korean, which i could not understand. Nothing much other than taking pictures, repeating it again. As it is situated in the mall, there are quite plenty of shops around. But to me, it's nothing much unless you are amazed and want to take a selfie by the tall bookshelf.", November 2019

21,5.0,Staggering Display of books,"Admittedly, I got teary eyed when I saw all of those books with readers of all ages sitting everywhere. This public library reminded me that some parts of the world values reading BOOKS & MAGAZINES, not just texts or social media. Do visit if you're in the area & then head to the Lotte World Tower, 5th tallest building in the world.", June 2019
22,4.0,Nice and Big Library,"We were just be there to take photo as all the books are majority korean language.Opposite the mall is Beomosa, there is walking distance but nearby.", October 2019

24,3.0,Smaller than I expected - blame IG,"I was expecting to be awe-struck But it was a ""library""/ bookstore inside COEX mallStill, worth a pic for instagram . Beware: lots of other people there for the same reason.", October 2019
25,5.0,Looks like something out of Harry Potter!,This was so not what I was expecting to find in the middle of a shopping mall - an enormous beautifully laid out library full of people of all ages browsing a reading rather than being on their phones. Amazing!, September 2019

27,4.0,Loved this,"I‚Äôm not sure this would be worth making a special trip to visit, but we were already in the area to visit Bonguensa temple (just over the road from the COEX Mall) so came in to see the library. It is wonderful - as book lovers it was a real jaw dropping sight! I can‚Äôt really imagine a UK shopping mall having a public library as a centrepiece...", October 2019
28,5.0,Every mall should have one!,"Wonderful resource in the middle of the mall.  For non-Korean readers, the offerings are a bit limited as most of the books are in Korean.  Nevertheless, there is a great selection of English magazines.  Very enjoyable to sit, people watch and take photos (which is what most were doing).  Having said all that, it is a great idea and other malls would do well to follow suit, even with a small/modest collection, if only to encourage people to read.", September 2019
29,3.0,More akin to Barnes & Noble,"So this was so neat to see, it's a beautfiul library, however, it's just too crowded with people grabbing the most insta-worthy picture. I felt a bit like Belle must have in Beauty and the Beast when she saw all those books in the massive library, but I was pretty sure I couldn't read any. We left after only 10 minutes here because it was just too crowded and noisy.", October 2019
30,4.0,Really entertaining for people watching,"I wouldn't quite call this a must-see attraction. As a library - it's pretty, but it's not particularly large. Also all the books are in Korean (no surprise).What makes it more appealing is how comfortable the surroundings are (you can grab a comfortable chair, and there's a good bakery on the second level for coffee and dessert) and just how entertaining it can be if you need a bit of a rest and want to do some people watching. Interesting to watch all the people go through taking photos, selfies, staging full on photo shoots fully dressed up and posing as they ride up and down the escalator.", October 2019
31,4.0,Picturesque Library ,"This is a unique library in the middle of a mall and convention center. Not sure how functional it is, but it makes a unique spot in the mall.", October 2019
32,4.0,Bright open and airy space (except for the noise!),"Situated in an upmarket shopping Mall (Coex), it seems an odd place to place a public library. It's definitely noisy and not the greatest place for a library. The upper levels are definitely better for reading and all the seats and desks are occupied most of the time. However, if you're into a look rather than a feel, it's definitely worthwhile walking through amongst the sea of books and look for the best place to take some photos. The books displayed on the upper open shelves are just boxes with a title page stuck on them. Practically speaking there would have been no easy way to access them so they are there purely for show. If you're near or in Coex (eg going to SM Tower), it's worth coming past.", October 2019
33,1.0,Typical KOrean site- Instagrammable and totally pointless,It's not like the books on those gorgeous shelves are accessible. You can't really read b/c of the noise even if you could snag one of the few chairs. They spent a lot of $ on construction - b/c Insta publicity is more valuable than anything else., April 2019
34,4.0,If in the area walk in,"This place is impressive. I would not invest time to go there, but if by coincidence you are in the area (e.g. because of your hotel), walk in and sit down for some minutes on the upper level seats.", October 2019
35,5.0,"Best photoshoot, library theme","This library is bright, looks fabulous and offers the best place to take photos with books.The location is very convenient for leisure and shopping.We did not browse the book lists though.", October 2019
36,4.0,Modern Library,"It is a library where you can take a very instagrammable pictures. Stunning design of the skyhigh book racks. If you really want to read a book, i would say that the environment is quite noisy as it is accessible to COEX shopping mall with many people walking around. A korea entertainment industry is also there and if you are a K-pop fans, you‚Äôll gone crazy looking at your idol‚Äôs posters.", October 2019
37,4.0,Upscale mall,"It is inside the Starfield Mall which is an upscale one, easily accessible on Line 2.  If you are going to Gangnam anyway, it is worth going.  You will like to take some photo of the place and do some shopping in the mall, which is one of the best in the city.  There are a lot of choice of restaurant.  If you have the time, you may also visit the aquarium which is quite nice.", October 2019
38,5.0,Inspirational - a beacon in a sea of shops,"Who would have thought to place a library in the middle of a shopping mall, near Samseong Metro Station? It was genius who brought this to life with such an inspired design.Starfield Library has four stacks - eight layers of books mostly for display - one at each corner of a square. There are books and magazines accessible to the public, at shelf level. There are chairs and desks to sit at to read them, which were all well used. It's a busy buzzing place.Take it in slowly, and explore the Library from all angles, and on both levels, to absorb the genius. Take a spare chair. Listen to the tinkling piano music.Then indulge another sense - taste - and go to the Billy Angel Cake shop on the upper level in one of the stacks and enjoy their famous carrot cake and a long tea.  Then go back into the mall inspired by an architectural marvel.", September 2019
39,4.0,Short View Of Library,Went all the way to this place..saw the library inside a mall but never did get a chance at all to look at the shops inside the mall. Wasted day spent with a person who would rather shop at markets instead.., August 2019
40,5.0,Harry Potter in Korean is here :),"Gangnam can be a bit of a trek by metro is you are staying in Jongno or near Namsan but if you want to visit a cool mall, Coex is fun.  The library is a great Instagram spot and you can have the fun of checking out Harry Potter books in Korean and the Star Wars novels in Korean as well.", September 2019
41,3.0,Underwhelming,"Pretty cool stack of books in the middle of a busy/popular mall.  Not sure that it qualifies as a library and I cannot imagine that there is any hope of getting work/studying done here.  Hugely popular spot for taking pictures - lots of individuals/couples/families taking pictures all over the place to the point where it is 1. impossible to get a picture without getting someone else posed in yours 2. impossible to avoid getting into someone else's picture.  If you are at the Coex mall for another reason it is worth visiting - not worth the trip just to see the ""library"".", September 2019
42,5.0,Amazing design,This is such a great place to relax while you wait at the mall.  It's filled with books and magazines you can read for free and they have desks like a library where some locals study or read. The shops around are also international brands., September 2019
43,5.0,Good not Enough,"I love the interior design,Everyone appreciates around there, But staff is not friendly / there is someone who wears glasses with White shirt/ Guy which is i asked about take a photo of me he said just NO, and staring at me like noONe. Bad experienced for solo traveller", October 2018
44,5.0,A very cool library,"I went to this library the first day I came to Seoul. It is really big and really nice. I could have spent hours there just watching all the books.There is also a cafe. Some people also try to study there but I wasn't sure if they really succeed. For me, it's a little bit too loud for studying but the sit there, read a book, drink a coffee or tea, it's fantastic.", September 2019
45,4.0,Awesome Library,"I was so amazed by how big this library is! This was so strategically located, so it can easily be accessed by locals and tourists alike.", April 2019
46,4.0,Noisy library but fantastic vibes,"Given it‚Äôs proximity to the Co-Ex museum, this was meant to be a pit stop for me to tick off my Seoul list.  However we stayed for a longer than expected time, taking in the tall structures (3 in all) and how they have been categorised.There‚Äôs a whole lot of movement and noise (not your conventional library) and obviously Korean books make up 95% of all the books here.  Interesting to see that there are donated books -both by large corporates/ Foundations and by individuals.There is a very short write up to the library in Korean with a smithing (subtitled mainly) of English -which i had fed back to the information counter, was insufficient.Spoiler alert: middle to TOP layers are ‚Äúfake books‚Äù according to the lady at the counter... don‚Äôt quote me coz it could be lost in translation; but frankly, it didn‚Äôt make much difference if that was the truth ;)", September 2019
47,4.0,Huge and beautiful library ,The library is probably more for photo taking then books reading. Undoubtedly very instagramable. While it isn‚Äôt totally silent yet it is not noisy. Problem is that it is very crowded. Still glad that I came., September 2019
48,5.0,Very big library,"This library is huge with an amazing interior and place to enjoy your time. There are quite a lot selection of books that you can choose. However, almost all of the books that provided in here were in Korean. But it's a good place to take pictures also", January 2019
49,5.0,massively beautiful,"Lovely place and a must visit while in Seoul. This library is at the Coex Mall, so there is a lovely Mall adjacent to this. Lots of restaurants and cafes, even McDonald's. Lots of photo opportunities. there is a duty free area downstairs as well, so you can purchase alcohol, cigarettes etc duty free, just remember your passport.", August 2019
50,4.0,Impressive,I heard about this place but definitely have to visit the place in person to realize the crazy nature of the design and the architecture. Highly recommend., August 2019
51,4.0,Kids can read for free,If your staying around the area in the hotels this is a good place to meet up if you lose each other. I came her with my family with 4 kids. Ranging from 9years to 7 months. We rested on couches and read some books to the kids so they could take a break from the heat., August 2019
52,3.0,Instagrammable,"I don't think it's worth traveling to, but it was a cool experience for the first 10 minutes. Maybe if you're bored with your friends and are in the area, but as it's a bit out of the way, I think if your time is limited in Seoul/Korea, then your time could be used for something else. This is something that I would recommend more for someone who was living in Seoul and was looking for something else to experience than someone who's traveling to Seoul/South Korea and has limited time here.", March 2019
53,5.0,Wow,One of the highlights of this trip.  How good is a library in a mall?   People were using it from early morning to late at night.  It is just a wonderful resource and piece of design.  I just kept coming back to enjoy, August 2019

56,4.0,A beautiful library!,"This library is very inviting as a place to sit and read for hours, or take photos.  Not sure if there are any English books, but there were all kinds of Korean books.  It's worth visiting if you want an Instagrammable travel photo.", July 2019
57,4.0,Impressive,"Just like pics. Really an impressive place, especially by night with all the lights. Even without stopping to take a book, the library itself make you feel small. A funny thing is that when you go upstairs, there are coffee shops and small stores between the shelves.The COEX Mall in its whole is really a cool place to go shopping!", July 2019
58,4.0,Just like in pics,"If you are around, definitelly nice to see, but for tourist there is not much more than what you see in pictures.", July 2019

61,4.0,Interesting,"How books became an element of decor ? Well, that place is probably showing the way. If you are looking for literature, pass your way. But if you want to see people reading ""for the dummies"" while shopping, you won't be disapointed.", July 2019
62,5.0,A Star In The Centre Of Starfield,"A stunning example of design in this sprawling underground shopping mall. Take time to enjoy the ceiling as well.

66,5.0,Books Stonehenge,"Smack in the middle of COEX mall, with no doors and all open access, you will find this monument to printed books. Natural light filters in from the ceiling and the sides of the mall (the largest below-ground mall in Asia), illuminating the gigantic bookshelves with carefully-placed books, giving a first impression of wonderment and spaciousness. Part library and part tourist attraction, it is likely that the tourists taking pictures outnumber the actual library patrons, though the patrons linger with a book in one of the many seats arranged in the hall, and the tourists snap pictures and move on. A cafe is conveniently located in the premises, for those who want something sweet with their reading. The concept is very interesting, as it appears like a space for boundless access to information. But in this day and age, when printed books are quickly being replaced by electronic media, this library is a work of art that could be interpreted in many ways by the diverse audience...", June 2019

Note that since it is inside a mall, there is a constant hum of noise and activity so it is not like the typical library you may familiar with but it is worth a visit nonetheless.

In the middle of the library is a tall art installation made of books? You don‚Äôt have to worry because there are lots of seating areas either on the ground or 2nd floor. There are even long tables on the ground floor and small cozy tables on corners in the 2nd floor where you can have a quiet moment to yourself.

When we leave the mall, we were trying to ask the enquiry desk about the return route.  The reception was not helpful and told me she is the receptionist of the mall.  She only knows the information about the mall.   This is the 2nd time I encountered this, I was so surprised that such a big mall and they will not provide the transportation information.

An area that was used to have seasonal events.As you can see from the pictures, the library is HUGE! Of course most are Korean books. But they do have some english books. Not that many. Everyone can read it for free. Not sure how to borrow a book. Guess you need to be a member first.As you can also see, so many shelves with books. I noticed from the elevators (yes, I explored the library) that most books are for decorations only. They are not even books. Just boxes with prints. The books from the reading shelves, are arranged quite helpful. You can see categories in both korean and english. It also have desks, tables, lights, couches, electricity, etc to make you convenient.There is a mini market where you can buy drinks, pens, etc. and also a cake/ pastryshop. Guess they provide these so young people want to visit the library. At the upstairs, i could see that not everyone was reading a book. Some were taking selfies, photographs, and some even just chatting. I wouldn't be surprised if i saw couples dating.Overall i really recommend you to visit this library.
