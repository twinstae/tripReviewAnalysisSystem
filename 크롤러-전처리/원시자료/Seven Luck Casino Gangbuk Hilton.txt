0,5.0,Good experience,"Clean air due to non smoking environment, smokers can smoke in smoking room within casino. This is a mini casino, thus it is quite quiet making gambling here is pretty pleasant. Free food provided for visitor who gamble here. Workers here are mostly polite. Nice place to visit", October 2019

5,1.0,Horrible experience!!!,, December 2018
6,1.0,Horrible customer service,"Customer service who works at reception desk was very unprofessional to say the least. When I showed US passport card, they denied my entry but couldn't explain why. Later, the lady said she couldn't read Alphabet - did not know what was written in the card who clearly recognized the same alphabet in the passport later. She lied again claiming that she was an immigration officer who can deny the entry based on her own judgement. While the validity of US passport card for a casino entry remain to be debated, her attitude and response was not professional nor pleasant. Will not visit there again, never.", April 2017
7,1.0,Not Really English Speaking Friendly,"All the other reviews sum up the basic idea of this place, small, cramped, and not very fun when compared to a place like Vegas.  I sat down at a slot machine and I there was no one around.  I stupidly put in my voucher of 23,000 won into the machine and looked up to see that someone else had left a Players Card in the machine.  Before I knew it the owner returned and started slapping my hand as I tried to hit the help button.  A manager came over and I explained the situation, but the final result was sorry...there is nothing we can do.  So the guy basically assaulted me and got to gamble with my money with no compensation from the casino.  This place is a money pit.", March 2017
8,1.0,Only worth it if you are staying in the Hilton,"This was the smallest casino I have ever stepped foot into. There are no craps tables and as you would expect it is mostly baccarat. I stayed at roulette for a few minutes and I wish I was exaggerating, but it was 5-7 minutes between spins.", March 2017
9,2.0,Small Casino and Packed,, January 2017
10,4.0,Ok place if gambling is your thing,"This is not a make a casino what you would expect anywhere in Los Vegas. This was basically the size of a high school gymnasium,  but it did have all of the essentials.  And although my little walk around only lasted two or three minutes they did have complementary iced coffee water and plum tea. No pictures for this post because they don't allow photography inside and be sure to remember your passport just walk in the front door.", September 2016
11,1.0,Not what would you expect....,, May 2016
12,4.0,Great place to gamble ,"Needs more tables, was standing for a seat to play averaging about 45min  -1.5 hr. The beer or alcohol beverage coming around the casino is delivered by one,yes one, person. This is crazy, if you are on the later end of the rotation the beer is warm and flat. Not the way I want my beer. I ended up going to the bar myself to get a cold one.", April 2016
13,2.0,Managing Director ,Only for foreigners but everyone speaking only in Korean. Poor quality slots. I never saw any  winner of jackpot. I stayed there 8 nights., March 2016
14,2.0,Interesting,"I like casinos. I like visiting different casinos. This casino is small, crowded (hard to get a seat at a blackjack table) and not service oriented. I was betting a significant amount (10x minimum) and was told the beer cart would be around once an hour. Just to get a ten ounce paper cup of beer. Interesting. I joined the club, and hope that over time, as I play recreationally, service will get better.", January 2016
15,2.0,"Small, not enough poker tables",Very small casino and very crowded on the weekends.  There are not a lot of poker dealers so you have to wait hours to play.  The automatic order machines for food were both out of order so you cant order food at the time because you cant order directly to the waitresses.  Managers are unable to speak other languages but yet no Koreans are allowed it is for foreigners only so why not speak other languages?  Not a good casino don't waste your time or your money., January 2016

18,5.0,This is a lovely hotel in a fabulous location.,"Mr. Hong who manages the hotel should be commended.  This hotel is awesome.  The food choices are great, the service wonderful and it's location can not be beat.", October 2015
19,1.0,Don't expect to make any noise...,, August 2015
20,2.0,Don't Bother If You're Looking for Gambling Action,"I only know of this place because I stayed at the Hilton next door.  My mother (who is a big gambler) was initially excited but quickly became disappointed upon entering.  First of all, the place is pretty small.  I believe there might be less than a 50 slot machines in total.  Second, the machines are all pretty old and according to my mom, they weren't very fun or interesting. I'd say if you're looking for gambling action in Asia, head to Macau.", February 2015
21,3.0,Not a big casino,"Get a 30000 won voucher from the Korean Tourist Promotion website http://english.visitkorea.or.kr . Very convenient if you stay at Millenium Seoul Hilton because it's located at the basement.  Well, it's a casino , what to expect? Table card games and slot machines, counter serving drinks. What else?", October 2014
22,3.0,Just an ok casino but nice that it's attached to the hotel,"This casino was quite busy and I don't think they were all folks staying in the hotel. Although they say no locals, there seemed to be a lot of people there so they must have all been visiting, mostly from China. The casino is quite small with about 2-3 dozen tables and the same number of slots. The minimum bid is actually quite high compared to what you can get in Macau or Vegas. For a fun place to lose a bit of money and have some fun, it was a nice getaway but it is quite small and not that much variety.", May 2014
23,2.0,Too small,"Very different as far as casinos go.  The Hilton hotel itself is nice, but the casino is not.  You have to have your passport checked before you are allowed in the casino.  The casino is small, and there are not many slot games at all.  No one is smiling; overall depressing feeling.  I was happy to leave after just an hour.", September 2013
24,2.0,"Small, Old, and Depressing","This place looks great on the outside and as you walk in the entrance to have your passport checked.  Then, you enter the actual casino room.  It's so dirty and old feeling.  There really is no excitement in there or fun energy.  It's just a bunch of old people sitting around smoking.  There aren't free (alcoholic) drinks, although there is a long line to get your free coffee/tea.  Since Korean citizens aren't supposed to be legally allowed to play at this casino, I didn't expect there to be only Koreans there, but it seemed like we were the only foreigners who didn't speak Korean in the whole place.  The tables are run in Korean language, ironically, since Korean citizens are not supposed to be allowed.  I understand that we're in Korea and some people with Korean background but of different nationality will be there, but for a place that is supposed to cater to foreigners I expected that the dealers would at least be able to speak a language other than Korean.  Not the case.  None of them seemed happy to be there, and I felt like they just wanted us to leave.  Really not a welcoming atmosphere.  We left in horrible moods and completely disappointed.  This is only getting 2 instead of 1 because of the pretty entrance and exterior.", July 2013
25,2.0,bad service,, February 2013
26,3.0,Very Small casino,I visited this casino in 2008. Im not sure if they've upgraded it since then but if was very small. Probably as big as a banquet hall. They had great choices but I expected a little more., February 2012
