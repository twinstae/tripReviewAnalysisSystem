4,4.0,Bit of everything,"I would say this place has the best shopping in Seoul. With HnM, Stradivarius, Zara and more. There's not too much in the way of men's fashion here though. NBot too many choices as far as dining goes, sadly, but there's enough. n", July 2018
5,5.0,Great Place to Shop,"Basically, all those retails/branded chainstores are in this place. Hyundai department store always have good promo on.

6,4.0,Nice Rooms &  Great Views,"Would I stay here again? YES.-The rooms are large, clean  and modern and the views are spectacular.-There's the subway station  & mall downstairs with supermarkets, food hall etc.The hotel has a few quirks though.-The lobby is on the 41st floor.  This is a tourist  outing hot spot stop for non hotel guest, so the express lifts are very slow and the lobby is noisy and hectic.  I couldn't get a seat a the bar because it was full of non-guest.-F&B is limited to the buffet, no Korean restaurant.", March 2018

10,4.0,A Great Mall!,"I love shopping at D-Cube and eating at the food court! It's conveniently connected to the subway and they offer variety of restaurants and stores like Zara, Bershka, Mac makeup store, Uniqlo and other Korean brand stores. I love hanging out here and meet with friends. There are great restaurants on the upper floors! Anyone visiting Seoul should check this place out.", January 2016
11,5.0,Pororo park is CLOSE,I went today and by my surprise this park is close.Now is another play are but not pororo related.A pitty because my kids was so excited with the comments and pictures about pororo and we found a nice play area but no pororo thematic and for toddlers, July 2016
12,5.0,Very nice foodcourt,we really enjoyed the sushi conveyor from the basement food court. The staff was courteous and friendly and was quick to assist in warming up certain sushi items. We visit twice in our 3 days in Seoul., July 2016
13,4.0,Feels like home,"This mall is different from any other malls that I have visit in Seoul. The moment I step into this mall, I feels like I'm back home in Singapore. There are many small little stores in this mall which has the same layout as our shopping mall. Although is called a department store but is like a shopping mall to me. Best of all, they close at 10pm whereby some of the department stores in town close at 8pm. Although is out of Seoul city area, it is still worth to travel down to do some shopping over there.", December 2015
14,2.0,D Cube City Pororo Park CLOSED,"Ask concierge for directions and they advised that it has closed, there is another indoor park next to Sheraton called KoKomo where my 6 year old had a good time", November 2015
15,4.0,Holiday at seoul,"My second time at D-cube city centre hotel Sheraton and it was a night stop. This time round I do find that it is a very beautiful hotel . Convience of shopping centre, food courts n a train station right below. As I had review before the inconvience of having the lobby on the 41st floor and having to change lifts on certain floors to go to the shops. It is very clean, beautiful decor and the staff are very polite , friendly and helpful, I will be staying another nite soon. The things sold there are different from Myeondong n Dondemuan but can always take the train about half an hour. I would rate it a 5 star if I do not have to change lifts!", September 2015
16,4.0,Best for food...shopping is just mainstream,"I was staying just within the mall complex...great for transportation, as the metro is below and once you figured out the metro line system, this is actually a good spot to head out to different places. Shopping is basically all about brand names and you can anywhere else for that. For eats you find a lot of junk food a well, such as Taco Bell, Mc Donald's or more, but the food court, even though far from what Lotte offers is pretty good. High quality, clean and sweet service, even if you cannot communicate with them, in case you do not speak Korean....I will add additional reviews on some of the places, but I recommend you check it out!", June 2015
17,5.0,Integrated location for both Office and LifeStyle,"Located at Sindorim Subway Station, the one time farmland has been transformed to an Integrated Office, hotel, eateries and shopping mall. It is self sustained and very convenient if you are there for business meeting at the office building, stay at Sheraton Hotel and there are good choices of nice restaurant for business entertainment. A great transformation that provides utmost convenient for business traveller. Two subway line connected to Sindorim station make this place very accessible to other part of Seoul, it is a very pleasant visit.", June 2015
18,3.0,D Cube - Pororo Park - Good for 5 years and below,"Went there on a Friday with my 6 year old kid.Access and location relatively easy. Line 9 Sindorim station, city area, short sheltered walk from station.Price 16k won for per kid and 6k won for each accompanying parent for a 2 hrs block. Free use of one small locker, good for 2 pairs of shoes and a bag.Park in my opinion too small and, facilities would be more interesting for 5 yrs and below. One midsize air inflated bouncing plaform with slide and ball pool, one small playground, one short train ride, and a theatre. Other additional play item like cupcake and sand castle require extra payment. Maximise your time day by catching the show at the theatre - 3D show, bubble show etc.Even for Pororo enthusiastic, photo moment may still even very limited. No live Pororo or other characters, just static display for picture.As usual, theme store available but restrictive in selection. Overall experience, a letdown for 6 yrs old biut should be fine for those below to spend 2 hrs. Thereafter you can visit D City Mall and the TEch Mall beside.", January 2015
19,5.0,D-Cube city.  Everything in one area,"We stayed at the Sheraton D-Cube City and had a wonderful stay.  The hotel is upside down with the lobby at the 41st floor and the hotel rooms were the 28th floor to the 40th floor.  All rooms had incredible views of the city.  The rooms were very modern and very clean.  Our room had two double beds (we were three adults) and the bathroom had its own steam room shower.  Of course flat screen tv and a built in safe for your valuables.  The wait for the elevators was just seconds and there is a gym on the 28th floor with a golf driving range (electronic) and a swimming pool.  The dining room is on the 41th floor and very expensive (breakfast is a buffet at $33/per person US)  Wifi cost extra but is free if you connect in the lobby.  All of the people who worked the front desk were courteous and very helpful.  I would give this hotel 5 stars on all levels.  In addition, on the lower floors is a 7 story shopping mall and on the two lower floor are wonderful restaurants serving all kinds of Asian foods (not just Korean).  they even had a wine shop and one place made Pizzas.  And the best part is that you can take a bus ($15 each way) directly from the Inchion airport to the hotel.  A cab will cost you about $70-75 and takes about an hour.", December 2014
20,4.0,Location is perfect for eateries at B2 level mall,"there are 4,000 eateries which does not open until 11 AM on weekdays, week ends on basement location of D Cube Mall attached to Sheraton Hotel. There are B1 24 hours McD and Starbucks type for breakfast when jet lagged and the Sheraton cafe which opens at 7 AM Nxt to it..Accross from the mall is a small eateries which opens at 930 am for bibimbab run by 2 Women for $6 bks or portage type BkFst.On Sunday's, most places to include home plus are closed!Home plus is a Wallmart type of supply with foods and there is a fresh homemade sushi called Charlie's place? Nxt to wallmart with the best sushi take out, yumm...again, this will close on Sunday's.", November 2014
21,5.0,They did just about everything right...,I go to Dcube mainly to visit and revisit many of my favorite restaurants.  It is literally attached to Seoul's busiest subway station and there are so many things to do there that I truly love everything about the place. There are so many good places to eat and I haven't been disappointed with any of them. The mall stores cater to a younger crowd and I would care if I liked to shop but I don't so I won't. Go up to the Hilton lounge on the 42nd floor for the best view on the west side.  It's tricky to find the elevators but well worth your time., April 2014
22,4.0,Busy,"The mall is really nice with lots of cafes and restaurants to offer.  As parking is very expensive, be sure to receive a parking credit from and place you've shopped.  You can also recieve additional credits at coffee shops.  I live in jamsil so this place is pretty far just to eat.  There are many local (huge) malls locally so I'd just stick to them.", October 2014
23,4.0,Good place to visit,Lots of shops and restaurants. Has a good variety of items to choose from. D-Cube is an adventure for everyone., August 2014
24,4.0,It's a mall,"Okay, it's a mall. But the Koreans know how to do malls. I'm more of a foodie and this place did not disappoint me. They have bakeries and any kind of food you could want from American burgers to Korean bibimbap. It's connected to the subway so it's easy to find and get to and there is a hotel and movie theater there as well. My friend was sick with a cough and we stumbled into a pharmacy to try to ask for cough medicine and the very helpful man behind the counter spoke English and helped us tremendously. He even gave us fans because we were hot.So, if you're into shopping or food this is the place to go.", August 2014
25,4.0,A nice place for events,"It's a well-planned mall for a younger audience with many amenities for events such as the Seoul St. Patty's Day festival. It's attached to Sindorim stn, so it is very convenient to get to, and when they finish revamping the subway station, things are going to look and feel very differnt", September 2013
26,3.0,LOW BUDGET MALL,"A tacky place. Feels like a fish market but with cloth. Really cheap prices in low end ""designer"" clothing. Don't expect to find a 1k dollars wath in this mall. Scketchi.", December 2012
27,5.0,A Real Mall,I am a huge fan of D-Cube city.  I always enjoy spending a day shopping here.  It has a lot of shops and you are sure to find what you are looking for.  There is also Pororo land which is a huge hit with the kids.  There is something for everyone here~~, November 2012
28,4.0,Retail Therapy,"This is a very complete mall with all of the major chains, a floor with many attractions for the children and most of the major shops.  It would be better if it had an electronics store as well.", August 2012
