0,3.0,It was nice!!!!,"There were so many people, so it is best to go early. I went in the evening, as I just want to stand and watch the fireworks from the stairs. You can eat many street food here, and also can rent a bike to ride before the firework show start. The firework show was okay, I can't", September 2019

3,5.0,Big bada boom!,"This may have been the most amazing fireworks show I've ever seen. Canada's show was just OK (sorry Canada!), but Spain's was great and Korea's-- I didn't know where to look, there was so much going on at once!!Great food and tons of cheap ballooons/glowsticks and junk your kids will beg you for. Super crowded, so if you want a riverfront seat get in early. It's worth it!", October 2018

6,5.0,And the party goes boom,"This isn't just another fireworks festival. In fact, it is one that you should really come and experience for yourself.The Seoul International Fireworks Festival usually takes place around early October, but the date changes every year, so do search it up on Google to find out the exact date.I strongly recommend attending this festival because you are sure to enjoy it and have a lot of fun. The fireworks display is amazing as it is spectacular, and there are even some sequences where the fireworks are released according to the music that is played in the background. You'll love it.The atmosphere is really lively too. The Koreans are the bunch who will cheer as the fireworks light up the sky, and that makes it really fun as everyone is just in the mood and enjoying the display.Even though the opening ceremony officially starts at 7pm, do head down to Yeouido Hanging Park as early as 4pm to get a good spot in the park. If you don't have a picnic mat or food to eat, don't worry, as there will be people selling these items nearby and inside the park. I do recommend getting fried chicken and cola to enjoy while waiting or enjoying the fireworks display - it is great picnic food.To get to the park, take exit 4 of Yeouinaru Station (Seoul Subway Line 5).", October 2016
