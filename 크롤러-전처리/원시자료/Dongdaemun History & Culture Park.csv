26,4.0,"A ""city park"" with displays to see","Totally a ""city park"" with high-rises of the Dongdaemun area in the close vicinity, this is not much of a place for relaxation & recreation but worth stopping by while in the very-lively (especially in the evening) Dongdaemun area around the big intersection of Jangchungdan-ro & Eulji-ro streets (where the Park is on one side of the intersection) which definitely is a ""should-not-miss"" area with: big department stores like Lotte & Doota, an evening outdoor market (with mobile kiosks spread out here & there along the sidewalk on one side of Jangchungdan-ro stretching north from the big intersection), Cheonggyecheon Stream (a well-known beautiful & yes ""very long"" stream going through the city in the east-west direction from slightly under the ground level, the area near this park is like an eastern section of the stream just about a 5-to-10-minute walk from the big intersection) and the Great East Gate (officially known as Heunginjimun which you'll get to pretty much right after crossing the Stream coming from the big intersection).And being not much for a leisure walk as mentioned above, the Park has some ""super-sized"" displays on its grounds such a vase and a luggage trunk (with a big padlock on one side & a big key on top as well) and also a ""fairly big"" area with artificial white roses (among the real green grass!) which I found sort of ""pleasing to the eyes"" despite knowing the flowers were not real.  Also, right beside the Park is Dongdaemun Design Plaza (an interesting-shaped building which is like two ""big ovals"" joined together) that can be entered where you'll see the interior which is ""quite stunningly"" pretty-much-all-white (the walls, the ceilings, a great portion of the floor & even some displays themselves).Coming by subway, Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station (on Lines 2, 4 & 5) is where to get off; the best exit is Exit 1 where you'll see the Design Plaza right in front when you come out of the station, and just go around the building on the left side for a few minutes and you'll see on your right the park entrance (which is like between the two ovals).", June 2016
27,4.0,Interesting walk around the park,"A modern park that has been designed and built in a very modern forward thinking idea. It is quite a pleasant place to spend a bit of time walking round, a good few photo opportunities.

38,3.0,Free area to come hang out,So this place is a huge area where people seem to just hang around - maybe its part of the Korean life. There are the ruins and wall here which jut out and there are also unusually designed chairs. People sit there or they even just lie there in public and chit chat with their friends.

45,5.0,Worth the walk,"We walked at our own pace up Seoul City Wall on a chilly morning,the steps were steep in parts, very natural sand and rock.  Climbing close to the Wall has not been specially made for tourists, there was a bit of rubbish around and it looked quite natural so if you have dodgy ankle problems or aren't a little bit fit you can walk along the roadway. The views as you get higher are very expansive so looked quite impressive, also there are vantage points for you to stop and rest for a moment. We caught the rail to Dongdaemun Station and it was just up the road, you can see the Wall from across the road at Dongdaemun Gate or you can catch the bus. Well worth the effort", January 2016

50,5.0,A Visual History treat,"A park that's not only acts as a breathing space for Dongdaemun , but is also complete with a museum on the stadium and the history of the area. Getting to see an actual floodway wall up close is a treat and a peek into the past of the area. A must visit in Dongdaemun, my home in Seoul !", September 2015
51,4.0,Avant Garde  Meets History Meets Shopping,"The focal point of this area is the space-age building in the centre square, which was designed by an Iranian architect. During excavations they found may relics from ancient Korean culture, and these have been incorporated into the complex.  The complex hosts many cultural exhibitions and has shops showcasing the works of modern artists, in various mediums. I visited the Esprit Dior exhibition which was fantastic but is sadly finished. Last week I also visited the Andy Warhol Exhibition which was only mildly interesting as all the information on the wall was only in Korean (and it cost W15000 to get in), so I'd say this is for die-hard fans only. There are also many free displays around the place as well.Across the road there are many clothing shops which would mainly appeal to teens, 20's crowd and in the side streets are many local restaurants.  There are also a lot of wholesale clothing markets in the area if you are after some special textile  bargains.It is worth coming just to wander around and at the buildings, especially if you like photography, it makes a great subject.", September 2015
52,3.0,Climbing up is hard but the gate is a historic place!,"One need to hike up to the top for a view of the gate.

54,5.0,Absolutely fantastic!,"What an incredible space! So many exhibitions to see here and they are all world class.  Not to mention the breathtaking architecture of the building itself - it looks stunning from below next to the ""conventional"" buildings on the street. I saw the Esprit Dior exhibition which was absolutely magical! Truly inspiring. I was hoping to go the Andy Warhol Live exhibition too, but I ran out of time. This place is a must-see for anyone with an appreciation of art, design and architecture.", August 2015
55,4.0,Funky Architecture,"Maybe not the quietest park ever known, but the charm is in the really neat architecture. It has lots of interesting photo opportunities, both day and night.", July 2014
56,4.0,It's especially beautiful on a late spring evening,"This attraction greets you straight out of the train station, and the futuristic building is the first thing you see upon exiting. If you love structures and architecture, you'll very much enjoy taking in the sights here. We visited this place at night since that's the best time to appreciate the lights that make the attractions even more striking. The rooftop garden is also worth a visit, if you have the time, and the walk leading up to it is quite romantic.", April 2015

62,5.0,looks like a UFO,"Stopped here to check it out. Very cool building, it looks like a UFO both from the outside and inside.

64,5.0,Lastest architectural design building in Seoul,"Designed by Zaha Hadid. whatelse do you need? It's directly connected with Seoul metro line number 4 (Dong dae mun history & culture park)nonetheless exhibitions are not quite interesting, the building itself is amazing. if you are a big fan of architecture then you must see it. when city of Seoul planned this project they want this to be like Guggenheim Bilbao and I think it will be. you can get into the building without buying a ticket unless is there any interesting exhibition you want to see. 4 exhibitions  ticket deal is 9000won (about 5GBP)", May 2014
65,5.0,Awesome building,This just opened in March.  All I wanted to see was the building thinking that it was an office building but there are museums inside and even a retail area.  It was my last stop before I departed so I didn't have enough time.  You must stay  longer and take a look at the museums.  It takes time also to just gaze at the building from different viewpoints.  Be amazed at modern architecture., April 2014
66,4.0,Zaha Hadid DDP,"It was a privilege to have seen a Zaha Hadid designed building in person as they are spectacular and few & far between. The Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) was completed in March 2014 and we arrived in April 2014 so I was stoked! The building takes on a futuristic design and incorporates Zaha's legendary curves. The building is huge and it had to grow on me at first as I first saw it during the day. I was travelling with with my girlfriend, who happens to be an architect, so of course she loved it before I did (haha). However, when I saw the building at night, everything made sense as far as design, location, and purpose. Spectacular!We only toured the Zaha exhibit (4,000 KRW = approx $4.00) as we weren't too impressed by the other exhibits. I just wanted to capture the aluminum curves on the outside and check out Zaha's exhibit. The building is very easy to reach by metro as the Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station is right next to it. I definitely recommend everyone see this building, and I recommend seeing it at night! Cheers.", April 2014
