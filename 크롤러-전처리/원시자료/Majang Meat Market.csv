4,5.0,half price compared to Myeongdong restaurants,"For same meat quality, I saw the prices in Myeongdong to be almost double than the prices at Majang Market. Of course the restaurants' price are already all in, while in Majang, the meats are brought to a restaurant that has a cooking charge per person, prices differ if you use charcoal (6,000 won), or stove top (5,000 won). Charcoal is slightly more expensive and this is what we chose. Prior to going in 1 of the upper floor restaurants, I specifically asked for charcoal, because I read that some restaurants are only table top.We got several meats: beef at 1+, and 1++. The difference was only 1,000 won per 100g, and though the 1+ was very good, the 1++ was noticeably better. We also got a pork moksal with  a 1++ rating and this was quite tender, and very good.After selecting the meats, I asked the store owner nicely if they have any discount (we ordered a lot, since we were 6 the initial total reached 146,000 won), and he willingly obliged to round it off to 140,000 won.Going there, we followed the route as provided by the blog of jovenatheart dot com:  take line 2 to wangsimni station and get out of exit 8.  At ground level, turn around 180 degrees and find bus stop ID 04-134.  I forgot which bus we took either bus number 2222 or 2015 (one of them was available at the bus stop, the other is not). 3 stops away, get off at majang meat market, bus stop id 04-119.  You will get out right at the west market entrance.   After our meal, we decided to walk off the meal, and we walked to Yongdu Station, around 500-800 meters away.", June 2019
5,4.0,Good selection of Korean beef,"Upon a friend’s recommendation, we visited the Majan Meat Market in Seoul. Many stores for your picking and good selection of Korean beef. Prices are about 10% lower than supermarkets in Seoul but shopping environment is certainly not as clean. Like most meat markets, there is a stench in the air. Bought some famed Hanwoo from a friendly store and made our way for BBQ lunch in a restaurant upstairs (BBQ restaurant charges apply). Meat was indeed very good, with good balance of marbling giving good meat flavours. Overall a nice dining experience for the family but I’d prefer to spend a little more to have better ambience.", May 2019
6,5.0,Good quality beef at affordable prices,"It was an interesting experience, buying fresh beef from the butchers on ground floor and having them take us to a BBQ place upstairs to grill the meat. It seemed pretty daunting at first.. as we wondered which cuts to get and whether we would get ripped off. However, everything fell into place. The butchers were very friendly and they recommended a beef set with a variety of cuts, all of which tasted so good (particularly the flat iron steak). We ended up having one of the best meals of our trip and will definitely go back again.", May 2019
7,4.0,Fresh meat market,Majang meat market - local fresh meat supply market place. For meat lovers- you can find the best quality Korean beef sold there.

9,5.0,O so delicious and great prices,"We went to Majang Meat market at around 7pm for dinner. Almost half of the shops were closed already. We managed to get a decent deal for a Korean platter and enjoyed the platter at a BBQ restaurant upstairs from the meat shop. The beef was so delicious. Even with the service fees at the restaurant, the total price of our dinner was still like 30-40% cheaper than the korean beef places in the city. Highly recommended.", February 2019
10,5.0,Excellent Beef at Affordable Prices,We were told about Majang Meat Market by friends and we really wanted to visit.  We went on a weekday afternoon and it seemed as if there would not be anything to eat.  The stalls were open and the restaurants upstairs seemed empty.We were prepared to return another day when we saw a restaurant with a lot of people eating.  We went up and were asked if we had bought the meat.  We said no and the staff got a guy to bring us down to the shop to choose our meat. We chose 530 grams of sirloin and 330 grams of striploin (total was 92000 KRW).  We wanted to order more but the guy said that what we had ordered was more than enough.Little did we know but the guy was actually the boss of the restaurant.  He was kind enough to help cook the meat and even recommended a plate of raw beef for us to eat.Do look out for this restaurant......Majangdong Hanwoo Town Charcoal Grill Meat Restaurant., December 2018
11,4.0,"The meat is fresh and tender, and we do recommend a visit to eat grilled meat","We were recommended this place and visited on a Friday evening. There are many stalls selling meat so prices should be competitive. We bought beef and pork, and the vendor recommended a restaurant nearby that will provide the grill and sides, for approximately W5000 per person.The meat is fresh and tender, and we do recommend a visit to eat grilled meat.", December 2018
12,5.0,Best BBQ beef in Seoul,A near city center local meat market which is worth to visit. Many Packed high grade BBQ beef provide by the meat shops which also guide you to restaurant nearby to cook and enjoy immediately.Price is reasonable. Don't miss it if you really want to taste real Korea beef., July 2018
13,5.0,Excellent place for Korean beef,"I was recommended to this place by my Korean guide. She informed me that this place serves top grade Korean beef at a lower cost than downtown BBQ restaurants. It is approximately 12000 Won or USD 11 per 100g or maybe lower depending on your bargaining skills. Usually if you purchase about 500g or more, they would throw in some complimentary beef parts or slices.There are tons of meat vendors here. Choose one you feel comfortable with and make your purchase and bring it up to the restaurants on the 2nd floor. Usually the vendor will recommend the restaurant unless you have one in mind. At the restaurant, its 5000 won per pax for using the BBQ grill, complementary side dishes, condiments, rice and ice water. Drinks and soup are at an additional charge. The grill beef was really tasty, juicy and tender. Spend a total of 160000 won for 6 persons....that's like USD25 per person for top grade Korean beef. I think it's a steal!", June 2018
14,5.0,"1++ Grade Korean Beef, at a much lower price","This place was recommended by some folks from Hong Kong as a great way to get top quality beef at a low cost.  Find a vendor (preferably one who sells the top grade of beef), choose what cuts you want, have them slice it, then take it upstairs to do Korean BBQ on their grills.  The beef was awesome.  They do supply some side dishes with the Korean BBQ.  Getting there was pretty easy.  Take the #5 line to Majang (station 541), walk straight, take the first left.  Then walk past the elementary school several blocks, and follow your nose to the indoor market on the right.  Wash the beef down with some good Korean soju.", February 2018
15,5.0,Best BBQ in Seoul,"Nice beef and most of the restaurant dun sell pork but you can get the pork u want at the adjacent mkt and bring it to the restaurant to BBQ urself. Cheap but most of the restaurant is crowded with locals during dinner time. Near to Majang line, walking distance.", November 2017
16,4.0,"Eat local, Korean beef","It's a local meat market, which itself is sort of a sightseeing spot?! First, you got to buy the meat from the stall, you can choose from any stalls. Then, the staff will guide you to the eating area upstairs. Upstairs area charged 5000 won per person. Offering not only the service, but also the appetizers (i.e. Kimchi and all the small dishes, 'free flow') and free wifi. You can order beers, cokes, rice, cold buckwheat noodle, etc, which of course with additional cost. We actually didn't compare the price with other Korean bbq restaurants, so can't comment on whether it's cheaper than outside or not. But, it's a nice and local experience.", September 2017
17,4.0,Korean beef BBQ- worthy and tasty,"We visited the 石信韓牛. You can buy the freshly cut 1++ loin there, and have BBQ upstairs. The BBQ place just charged 5000won per person for serving you with BBQ stove and many delicious side dish and veggie for wrapping the beef.Very nice experience there. Costs us just ard 60000 won over there for two persons, much cheaper than the Korean BBQ in city centre of Seoul/HK. One thing not very comfortable is that, the entire market is full of raw meat and their organs, Amitabha.", June 2017
18,3.0,Carnivore Heaven,"Given a choice, I'd rather be a pescetarian than to be a carnivore. The social occasion sometimes call for the latter.  Though not a beef connoisseur, my discerning taste buds is pretty good at sussing out a quality piece of beef than a poor quality piece. Because this is a meat market, the eateries selling beef here offer inexpensive beef for the BBQ which Koreans adore. The beef is average tasting for what you pay. I have been to other meat markets, like the famous one in Kichijoji......so Majang Market was a tad disappointing. Fortunately, I did not suss this place out. Friends suggested this place and led me there. One of those social gatherings that necessitates being a carnivore. We arrive in the evening & walked past rows & rows of closed shops with the heavy smell of fresh meat in the air. It must be pretty bustling in the day time. We headed straight to the cooked food street and enter one of the eateries. It was crowded with locals. We ordered the set that is the top of the range and different types of beef, and BBQed the beef sitting on the floor.  It was very very very ordinary.I doubt I will travel out to Majang market for BBQ :( I rather pay a little more for convenience and better quality beef in town......especially since i have limited appetite for beef. So it better be ......goooooood.", May 2017
19,5.0,"Majang Market""팔팔황금한우"" 馬場洞  八八黃金韓牛","The best place to enjoy Korean Beef and Pork with the half price of other restaurants. TOP grade Beef and Pork. Also, we got to choose what part of meat that we want to eat. I think Chuck flap tail is the best part one. Do not miss this place.43, Majang-ro 37-gil, Seongdong-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea", April 2017
20,5.0,Cheap and Awesome BEEF!!!,"If you're a MEAT lover, do not miss this place out. You get TOP grade Korean beef yet pocket friendly pricing. First you buy the meat after walking around the stalls. Then bring it to a near by restaurant and pay a small fee of 5000-6000 Son to cook your meat. Store owners provides Ban Chan (side dish) to go with your meat. You will not regret after visiting this place.", March 2017
21,5.0,Just half price compare with downtown,"The best place to enjoy Korean Beef with the excellence price.  It's just half price compare with down town restaurant, such as at Myeongdong or Dongdaemun.", December 2016
22,4.0,Excellent Beef,"Location is a little challenging to locate. Given the Korea does not support Google Maps, I would never have found the place had it not been a friend who was already there sending me his location via Apple Maps. After the train station exit, keep walking for a good 2-300m or so (can't remember the exact location but it will start to feel a bit suspicious but that path takes a natural left. Keep walking for another 10 mins and you will get there. And because I went at night, the lights made it quite obvious. The market didn't feel like it was bustling with life, unlike Noryangjin. But I noticed there are mainly locals and I didn't see that many tourists. Prices aren't exactly cheap but for that quality of beef, it is great value for money. I'm a beef lover and I go round the world trying to find good beef but I'm not an expert. I can only tell you what I like. Hanwoo (Korean beef) is highly valued hence the higher price. But if you're going to only be here once (in a few years?), the difference is not that big unless you're buying it for several meals a week then I might be more prudent. Don't need to look much further... Just buy the meats, pop upstairs any of the alley with stairs and get seated. As the restaurants are not ""trained"" to entertain foreigners, you can expect communication to be a little challenging. But that's what I like about this place because it has yet to be taken over by hoards of tourists.", October 2016
23,5.0,Wow!,"So much produce, so much bustle, and so much you either didn't know people eat or wouldn't imagine anyone would want to eat!  A whole street devoted to garlic, even.  Try the different stages of bean pastes, from fresh to 3 years old.  This is a tourist paradise and eye-opener.  As is the surrounding neighbourhood for herbs and spices, ginseng shops.  Easy to find from the metro. A vibrant spot to visit.", August 2016
24,5.0,~Slaughterhouse Meat Kingdom~,"I visit here at least twice a month.Best place for serious beef buyers (or pork), but mostly beef.Know what cut you want, or what part of the cow you desire. Also, if you want tenderloin you need to let them know 1-2 days in advance. Any other cut you can find on demand.I read a review by a lady that said the store owner is very honest. That is hilarious. First, I'll assume she is a rich lady because she bought the 75000W (75$) Korean beef - which may have included 2 steaks. Second, this is a massive market and honesty isn't flying around like pretty purple butterflies. If they can cheat you, they will --- though a few of the elderly grandmas are honest. I've had guys try to rip me off so many times because I am a foreigner, but I speak enough Korean to argue about meat and prices. **Also, many sellers will tell you something is Korean beef ""Han-oo"" and charge you a ridiculous price, and then give you AU or USA beef. This happens often and unless you know the difference I'd just buy USA-meeguk-sal, or AU-hoju-sal.I'm not sure why people praise Korean beef. Koreans have a sentimental attachment to their domestic beef, called sonmat, a belief that home-grown food is always good for you. It is good, but it is not worth 75$ for two small, thin steaks. Although if you have the money and you're certain the seller is giving you Korean beef I would say try it because it is fresh meat. I would rather have a lot of decent meat than a small portion of expensive meat for the same price. But sometimes I do eat the glorified Han-ooDon't get me wrong, I love going here. twice a month, maybe more in the summer because I bbq often, but you can negotiate. Majang has other meat restaurants though with fresh beef. I'd only go here to buy meat to take elsewhere. Why? because it smells like a meat locker!", July 2016
25,4.0,Everyone wants beef,"This is a well known area for selling meat. Most stores sell beef for BBQ. Different portions are packed for different number of people. The interesting part is that the customer can purchase the beef downstairs and take it up to the restaurants to BBQ. If you don't want to choose, there is the local BBQ alley with a number of BBQ restaurants. Portions can be huge. Negotiate for discounts.", May 2016
26,5.0,Yummy yummy beef,"The meat u will always miss it after u taste the 1++ korean beef here.Very reasonable price. The store owner is very honest and give u good recommandation.I bought different kind of meat to eat in bbq style at the upstair restaurant(including the meat and the restaurant minium charge, v spent around 75000 won for 2 person). The quality if the beef is super good. After that i also bought some back to hong kong. The store owner was so carefully to choose the good one for you and vacuum it nicely with ice pack.", April 2016
27,5.0,Meat Galore!,"Found out from a friend about this meat market. They sell Korean beef and pork. I reached at roughly 4pm and at least half of the stalls were closed. Randomly chose a stall to buy meat from and the seller very kindly took us to a restaurant on level 2 for us to grill the meat. If you are a meat lover, i suggest buying at least 750g worth of meat for 2 pax. The restaurant will charge you 5000won/pax for the banchan and the services they provide. They have a menu for drinks and other add-ons like rice, vegetables and mushrooms.How to get there: Take purple line to Majang Station, exit 2. Walk straight till you see a gas station, turn left and walk straight. A school should be on your right, and further down is the meat market on the same side.", April 2016
28,4.0,Good Korean beef,"We went on Sunday, most of the meat shops were closed, so if you want to go beware on Sun. We just went to the restaurant nearby, and try the combo with Korea's beef! The beef there were totally difference from Canada! Seems to be taste better 😁 If you love beef, must try!", March 2016
29,4.0,Slightly Cheaper Meat Price from Another Place in Seoul,"I came here because I want to try fresh meat right from its first hand since I read some reviews that this market is one of the biggest supplier for meat all across Seoul. It's quite hard to find this place since it's located quite far from subway station. But just ask the people you meet and they'll surely help you :)I asked some sellers to get best meat with best price and ended up buying 500gr of A++ grade hanwoo (Korean beef) with 45000won. It might be quite expensive but you wont get this price in another place in Seoul right? dont forget to bargain and ask for some meat for bonus ;)After you got your meat, tell the seller that you want to grill the meat and they'll take you to the restaurant nearby to grill the meat. You only have to pay 5000won for rice, grilling the meat and unlimited vegetables wrap and banchan (korean side dish). The meat was really tender and delicious :"")Hanwoo is indeed popular for being sooo expensive yet so tender, so make sure you try hanwoo once you're coming to Korea.", May 2015
30,4.0,Beef Lovers Paradise,"Recommended by my friend that I should not miss this place for best beef, I went there by taxi from MyeongDong and it took me 30 mins to reach there.  There were meat shops selling beef and stripes in raw.  Bargain with them on the prices and you may get them at best prices.  After that, similar to the practices of seafood market, you will be guided to the restaurant to cook at a cost.  Excellent beef quality for bbq; much cheaper than eating at bbq restaurant.  Worth another visit on the next trip.", December 2015
31,5.0,really worth it for meat lovers!,"This place is really worth it! We had the best beef, it literally just melts in your mouth!we went there on a saturday afternoon, there were so many shops selling pork & beef. We bought the meat we liked and then took it to one of the restaurants upstairs, they provided the grill and side dishes at a cost. We also had the korean style raw beef w/ egg and pear, which costed an extra 5000won for the ahjummas to prepare. If you are a group of 6 people of more, some restaurant charge a cheaper price per person.", November 2015

33,5.0,Must visit for food lovers when in Seoul. A++ Beef,"Executive summary:Pros - Excellent quality beef A++, much cheaper than restaurants, fun to shop for your own cuts of beefCons - Market is clean but is a wet market, so be prepared...don't expect spotless streetsAfter purchasing meats, the butcher usually will recommend one or two restaurants (above the shops), where you can bring the meat for grilling for a cheap price. The restaurant will usually include salads, leafs and sauces.Top tip - Make sure you download or print a picture of beef cuts with both English and Korean titles, as very little butchers speak English but are all more than happy to help.", January 2015
