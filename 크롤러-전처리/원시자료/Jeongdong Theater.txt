2,4.0,A very entertaining and high-tech performance,"While this is a very commercial presentation, it is very high quality, and performed by very talented people.  Well worth including in your visit to get a taste of Korean music and dance.", October 2018
3,5.0,Entertaining Show,"I saw ""The Palace"" show with my friends. The show is a story about a king and his concubine. It's easy to understand because there aren't a lot if dialogue and they have subtitle in English, Chinese, and Japanese for foreigners.", April 2019
4,4.0,Entertaining and amazing cultural show,"I thoroughly enjoyed this 75 minute “The Palace” performance which was easy to understand and follow, in part due to the expressive acting, but also the English narrative provided on the screen to the side of the stage. Interesting folktale told with imagination and style. Wow! Such amazing dancing and percussion skills; if you have a dancer or a drummer in your family, GO to this performance because you’ll be amazed at the talent exhibited. I purchased my ticket 15 minutes before showtime and got an excellent seat (the theater design is such that I don’t think any of the seats would be ‘bad.’). The performers interacted with the audience in a fun and entertaining way and the pacing was fast enough that I think younger children would stay engaged. The interior was cool, which was refreshing after a hot afternoon, but might be chilly after awhile. Short walk from the City Hall metro stop. Definitely worth the $43 ticket!", May 2019
