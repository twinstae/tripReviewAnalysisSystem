1,1.0,"China  + 1, South Korea -1","avoid at all cost... rude sellers, overpriced goods .. sellers at the basement 1 and 2 are very rude to tourists .. one shop even looked at us from head to foot and told us rudely that they cannot sell to us, ""Do not touch original""... i was just asking the price of the item on display even though the item covered in plastic (glad wrap)... he took the shoe from my hand that what was on display ( a very good valentino open top rock stud sneakers for men knock off)... sellers will first google the price of the LEGIT item before telling you their price... PASS on this mall... cheaper to buy in europe for Legit items that are on sale than deal with RUDE Migliore knock off sellers!!..... imho sellers in so called ""silk markets"" in mainland China are nicer to deal with...", September 2019
2,4.0,Typical shopping mall,"Migliore mall is located in Dongdaemun, with many shops selling fashion apparel, accessories, shoes, bags etc targeting the younger generation, especially women. Prices are reasonable. This is one of the newer malls in Dongdaemun.", June 2019
3,1.0,Aggressive sellers,Do not bother wasting your time in this mall especially in the males section . Aggressive sellers trying to coerce you to buy super overpriced goods with nasty attitude when you don’t buy from them, May 2019
4,1.0,"Very pressurizing, especially male section",, April 2019
5,3.0,Similar to Bangkok Platinum Mall,"We went in early morning. Hence, there was no crowd. The layout is similar to Bangkok Platinum mall. Every level selling specific stuffs. Lower level for apparel, higher level for bags, shoes, accessories, luggage. Quite a good place to shop if you know what you want.", April 2019
6,3.0,Cramped and crowded store,, July 2018
7,3.0,Good place to shop but some of the seller attitude can be better.,, June 2018
8,3.0,Not as nice as before,We have been to Migliore on previous trips and found this place had somewhat deteriorated. There were more empty units and the range seemed to be become lesser. The men's section on the 4th floor was quite scary as the sellers were more aggressive. There were a lot less shoppers as compared to 2 years ago in the same mall. The prices didnt seem as cheap anymore. We bought much lesser this time round. Will try the malls beside in the dongdaemun area the next time., May 2018
9,3.0,Cluttered with small shops,"Dongdaemun area is a shopping paradise and Migliore is a multi storey store in the midst of it. It’s crowded with little shops organised around a theme eg women’s, children’s etc, but that’s about all there is in organisation! All the stores sell varied and sometimes duplicative items but if you persist, there are some good buys to be had.", March 2018
10,1.0,Super Bad Experience ,"super bad experience here. sellers were super rude and unfriendly. this place is also filled with youngsters that are rude. i went to one of the shop and was browsing at the dresses and i was holding onto one that caught my eye. i took less than five minutes and then the seller snatched the dress away from me and asked if i wanted it so i replied that i still want to look around. she then began to mumble and say that i kept saying i want to look look look. hence, i decided to put the dress back and walk off with my sister. NEVER DID I EXPECT THAT she actually chased us and tapped on my sister's shoulder hardly and scolded: 'u look look look, no buy, no say thank you! NO MANNERS!' and then stomped off. i was so shocked by her rude and odd behaviour as we were already at another store that's quite far away! didn't expect this odd woman in her fifties (the store owner) to actually chase a customer to scold him/her. i guess she ALWAYS does this to customers as another seller actually told us to continue looking at the clothes (at another store) and ignore her. what i'm trying to say is, customers have customer rights. it doesn't mean that after we look we HAVE to buy.", January 2018

18,5.0,Ideal place for shopaholics,, December 2016
19,4.0,A mini Platinum Mall (BKK) in Korea,"The first thing that came to mind in the layout and products was Platinum Mall in Bangkok, but this is a scaled down version and prices aren't as cheap as in BKK (natch). Still a nice mall to see wholesale priced clothes (more fashionable) and shoes (sneakers galore) and accessories. Was looking for glitzy sneakers but couldn't find anything with the right look and price. Picked up a couple of accessories but then .... wasn't really in a shopping mood! A good mall to visit especially since stuff was cheaper than in Doota Mall next door.", November 2016
20,3.0,A typical big shopping center of SK,, August 2016
21,2.0,Overpriced goods,"Got coerced into getting a t-shirt for 20,000 won. Saw the same shirt going for much cheaper at Migliore Myeongdong. Don't believe the hype about low prices. I believe prices have risen thanks to the increasing popularity of the place.", July 2016
22,3.0,Not cheap and limited size,"I always heard of must visit dongdaemun when u r in Seoul. Varities of cheap and affordable clothes.. Varities of clothes is true, but not cheap.. And the size is very limited", April 2016
23,4.0,A whole sale fashion mall for ladies and men n toddlers,, June 2016
24,5.0,Trendy shopping mall,"Love every moment there. They have a sale going on, which was brilliant. There are many different local designers that was featured in that place, and is definitely worth a trip there if you are fashion conscious, or have teenagers in tow.", March 2016
25,4.0,Bought souvenirs!!,Visited this place as it was the part of culture transit tour. Nice place to shop for souvenirs. Bought some key chains and socks. Bargaining is little hard. Prefers cash as some of them do not have POS machines., November 2015
26,3.0,Its alright,"Each mall contains the same style of clothes (small kiosks like), theres so much stall of the same type of collections makes me feel Ive been entering the same shopping mall. Koreans don't have the habit of bargaining so most items you see are pretty fixed unless you can kindly ask for a discount. Theres a lot of nearby skincare shop that are similar to (the body shop, bath and body works etc) which are pretty affordable and dirt cheap compare back in North America.", December 2015
27,3.0,Good but not my taste!,"The whole are in and around is very famous for shopping, again its not a cheap bargain and size is all for tiny people!!", August 2015
28,4.0,so many beautiful things here!,, August 2015
29,5.0,Midnight shopping,"OMG despite what people say, (overpriced cheap stuffs etc.), I love the place! For me, all the garments that i bought there were within reasonable price. I stayed at the mall from midnight until 4am. The outside of the mall was still packed with people (koreans mostly) although it was 4am. The coffeebeans was still opened. Taxis everywhere. Or if you don't want to take a cab, wait until the first train at 5.30am. I went there on a Saturday night.", September 2015

31,5.0,amazing collection,"It was great fun shopping at migliore as you can find everything there shoes, accessories, clothing, bags etc. Trying clothes is a problem there so one should have an idea about their sizes. you get designer and all big brands quality stuff there, i have told all my friends to visit there is a must", April 2015
32,4.0,Great shopping BUT,"But they are very pushy. My mum bought a ₩225000 ""leather"" jacket but i think we may have been ripped off lol anyway apart from the ultrrraaa ultra pushy retailers shopping is decent. Cash=discount and they speak some english. Affordable shopping though. More for young people.", June 2015
33,3.0,"Not amazing, but not bad for late night shopping","Not a place to go if you want anything somewhat high-end (or low-end..), but is a good place to spend your time at 3am if you are jetlagged and slept for 8 hours of the evening... Come ready to negotiate and never pay the original price. They'll usually drop it 10% before you even ask for a price. Once you've been here, no point in going to any of the other shopping complexes as they are pretty much identical.", June 2015
34,5.0,After Hours Shopping till 5am,"Our favourite place to shop after everything else has closed, cos Migliore opens till 5am in the morning. Although some find this mall a little pricier than others, we are familiar with where our favourite shops are, and keep coming back. Besides, bargaining is allowed, so we have a chance to practise our negotiation skills. There is also 1 shop in the corner near the escalator on one of the mid-floors that sells lots of Korean souvenirs and Kpop memorabilia. The shop owner is very friendly and generous with discounts, so we usually buy all our gifts here.", December 2014
35,4.0,Take Tour Time,"If Bangkok have MBK & Platinum malls, Seoul beats them as Migliore and the one beside it are open till early morning! Lots of selections at fairly good quality and reasonable price. Although haggling for the price can be tricky at times coz others are willing to give addl discounts while others don't. The upper levels for men's wear are more lively as the male sales people are more willing to accommodate price haggling.", October 2014
36,5.0,We came here every night!!,"believe it or not but this is our playing area as shooping start quite late and ends the morning after. This place ectually never sleeps at night and clothes are pertty cheap too. We managed to buy a few pairs worth only KRW5000 ...its heaven for toys too as the underground level is filled with Pororor's toys and they are very high in quality too.However, dont expect to bargain as most shop are fixed price.", June 2014
37,4.0,Shop unil drop here !,Very large building that contains many shops. You can enjoy here for almost the whole day to go through all the shops inside. There are some coffee shops and food shops for you to rest & relax your legs before continue shopping., September 2013
38,3.0,shop after shop with similar items,, November 2013
39,4.0,Another Must Go mall in DDM,"Located next to APM,Migliore opens till 5am. So every night, DDM is very crowded compared to other shopping areas. It has many levels, each level cater to a different target market. There is also a queue of taxis outside the mall, so no worries even if you shop till after midnight.", April 2014

41,5.0,One of the best places to shop for clothes for nice design at cheap price,, December 2012
42,5.0,Bargain!,"The selections are huge, but to get a good deal, you've gotta really bargain for it. If it's not up to your desired price tag, then walk away nicely.", October 2012
43,2.0,Just lots of shops - not for bargain hunters!,"A lot of hype about not much. There are floors and floors of clothes, clothes, clothes and some of the shop owners won't let you try on the clothes, so no point! If you must tick the box, pop in and out and then go to Dongdaemun traditional Market for real bargains, but get there early as this local market shuts at 6pm and after that, only the malls are open.", October 2012
44,4.0,"Good variety, but beware of cut-throats",, September 2012
45,4.0,Need More Time Shopping,, September 2012
46,3.0,Simple shopping mall with fashion meant for the young,"Prices are competitive and no bargaining allowed as they are all fixed rates. Fashion not as up market but if you look closer, you may find some gems!", February 2012
47,4.0,Not bad,"The shopping here is good and there's definitely a variety. However, i wouldn't say the stuffs here are cheap for students like me. The shopping is mainly catered for women with only the top floor being a guy's zone. Its definitely a place with many small shops but the orientation of the shops makes it hard for one to keep track where one is going. By the time we finished the first floor, we were getting  lazy to shop the upper floors. hence you can see the reduction in number of people falling with each increasing floors. Maybe it's best to check out other places like gangnam underground shopping before heading here to get the best value for your apparels!", August 2012
48,3.0,"High prices, disappointing variety of accessories","In street markets in Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Singapore, sellers frequently offer creative designs in earrings and pendants at reasonable prices, and they say they bought them in Korea.  So we had great expectations for the accessories floors of Dongdaemun's Migliore Building. We visited at 11 am, just a half hour after they opened, and we could find only one kiosk that sold interesting accessories designs. Prices were higher than in the United States. The shopkeeper would come down about 5%, but that was all--even when we walked away. We felt the same way about shoes (at Migliore and in the Dongdaemun shore market) which were more expensive than at Pay Less Shoes in the U.S.  We found more interesting accessories and women's dresses and blouses in Doota!, and in many cases we were able to negotiate discounts there. In both places, language was more of a problem than in Hong Hong and Chiang Mai, and kiosk owners seemed curt and unfriendly. We did not visit Migliore during past-midnight wholesale hours, so perhaps the ""good stuff"" comes out after midnight. For accessories in Korea, we would rank Namdaemun Market first, Dongdaemun Doota! Second, and Dongdaemun Migliore a distant third. There seemed to be much more interesting accessories in Kowloon's Ladies Market, Bangkok's Platinum Mall, and Chiang Mai's Night Market.  And we felt we could have bought the same Korean accessories in Singapore cheaper than in Migliore Dongdaemun.  We suspect Korean merchants just have high reservation prices for foreigners in the downtown and tourist areas.", June 2012

53,1.0,Be very careful with the vendors!,"My shopping experience turned into a nightmare when my wallet,filled with cash and IDs and credit cards was stolen by one of the vendors!I accidently left my wallet at the one of the shops and came back to get it after i realised that about 30mins later, but they denied seeing my wallet,so i tried to look at other shops but since i was certain that i left it there,i came back again to the same shop and still, they pretend to don't even understand what WALLET is. So we asked help from the Mall's management and immediately looked into the CCTV. The guy was caught red handed!It was clear in the video he took it when i left it in on his table.The security retrieved d wallet fr the guy n said that he didnt understand what i asked of him. Honestly, there really r a lot of HOT guys n girls, but most of them r rude n unfriendly. I am NEVER going back to Seoul EVER again!", July 2011
