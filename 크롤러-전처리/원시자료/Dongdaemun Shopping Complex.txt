There is a constant stream of vendors coming and going from the market, and most are carrying long bolts of cloth.  It is quite crowded and easy to get lost, but keep your bearings and look for the letters to distinguish one building from another.", July 2014

131,5.0,Shopaholics' Paradise,"If you are a shopaholic, pick a hotel within this area so you can easily return to the hotel in the wee hours of the morning, or return to the hotel to keep your stuff, and then go out shopping again.Though some shops opened earlier, I would recommend visiting this place from 7pm onwards. Most shops only closed at 2-4am. The place is clustered with malls meant for retailers and consumers. If you are not a retailer, you can get great bargains at Good Morning City, APN and Migliore. Make sure you bring cash as you pay cheaper by cash instead of credit card. There are 2 higher-end looking malls nearby - Doota and Lotte Fitin which accepts credit card. There are cafes / food courts in both Doota and Lotte Fitin. Lotte Fitin closes earlier than the rest of the malls. I like Migliore the best among all as they have better clothes designs. You can get clothes on sale from KRW4,000 onwards. New designs are more expensive at KRW30,000 onwards. You can try the clothes / pants but there are no fitting rooms. You might be tempted to buy flashy shoes at these places (Good Morning City, APN and Migliore) but they don't feel that comfortable to wear. I got a similar looking pair from Doota instead at KRW78,000 with better lining. Some flats (shoes) sold at Good Morning City, APN and Migliore are comfortable though and costs only KRW10,000. Migliore was closed when we were there on a Monday while Good Morning City and APN were opened. On Tuesday, Migliore was opened but Good Morning City and APN were both closed. Not sure if this is the norm. In any case, when either malls were closed, there are still may vendors selling clothes / shoes / bags outside these malls. The quality / workmanship of items sold here are excellent. I bought some clothes here 2 years ago and after many washes they still look new. Try to bargain before you buy as I noticed some items sold here are few thousand won more expensive than the ones sold at Itaewon area and Gangnam Underground Shopping Mall.", May 2014

For jewellery etc, you should go over to Doota or Migliore.  My wife loved these two places so much that we were there for two hours while she browsed and bought several pieces.  I must admit some of them are good, but still a little prices.   But do not leave the area without visiting the Dongdaemun Design Centre across the road.

I found it is cheap compared to where I live but maybe it's average price for Korea, I've found some similar stuff cheaper around ewha and Myeongdong. We spent a lot of time here anyway and left around 2am.Since the subway was closed we had to get a taxi home, I wish we had done more research on the price! The guy started a speech on how all the subways and buses had stopped and now the taxis have a surcharge, which is true. He said 40000 won but he will do it for 30000 so we said ok since it is cold and we just wanna go to sleep. Again this price would be ok where we are from. This guy drives so dangerously and just drops us near the street our hotel is on. We find out later the trip should have cost maybe 10000 at the most. There are some stories online on other people getting ripped off worse than us by taxis outside so please check online before you get a taxi", November 2013

The floor we were on was mainly for clothes and accessories for the more mature. There was a huge selection, and the clothes were very well made and cheaper than the UK. There is another building selling items for the young. You can certainly spend the whole day shopping there and it is easily reached on the metro.", November 2013

Since Korea still makes a lot of its clothing (i.e. not all outsourced to China), you will find affordable, stylish and WELL MADE pieces.I highly recommend you go to the ""Doota!"" building where they have entire floors dedicated to womens/mens fashion and accessories.  In the basement, there is an alteration service and if I recall, they charge 6 dollars for a hem.  They can do these in an hour or so. On the top floor, there is a food court - with one of the vendors notably selling katsu curry.  There is also a Burger King, a crepe place, and Korean food among others.", November 2012

In the ground floor the collection seem stuck in the 80's ;p so if you want to have the Korean K PoP star may be 1st to 3rd level is your floor :) if you bored to shop inside mall just get out and so many stall selling product from cosmetic to fashion :) finally we out from this shopping mall at 4 am in the morning and still wonder why so many people still came and go from this mall like never sleep ;p", October 2013

150,1.0,,"I am Korean by descent. I have never felt so embarrassed about my own people and culture. The sellers push you to try things on but when you don't buy, they get pissed. Some shops don't even let you try things on! They claim it will stretch out. In addition, everything is one/free size. Unless you are size 0/2, forget buying anything here. You think you are getting a bargain? Think twice. Doota is a shopping Mecca for many tourists. It might have been a bargain at one point in history but not anymore. They cater to tourists that flock to Korea to shop. They have raised their prices. I can get better prices in the US at the TJ Maxx, Marshall's or Last Call Neiman Marcus. Everything in Korea is made of polyester. I do think the workmanship is good but not the material used. If you want anything leather, prepare to pay. Most shoes I tried on below 10,000 won were not leather and they were made in China. I'm sorry but don't waste your time. You pay for quality. Anything I liked were well over 10,000 won. The floor I liked the most was the basement floor with the small local designer shops. Still pricey but at least you got unique one of a kind items. If you still insist on visiting, good luck! Take cash, you can bargain with cash and do not expect customer service if you are just going to browse.", June 2013

We bought outdoor jackets for $5 & $10 (AUD/US) & even tailored items for the same price. For these bargain items there tended to be one of each, so the hunt was part of the fun and the find made the bargain even sweeter. (Only hard core retail therapists may get my meaning here!) If you want to buy a traditional Korean Hanbok this is the place? You can have an outfit tailored or buy a ready-made one. Prices vary on the Hanbok, but this seemed the cheapest place in Seoul to go. Don't forget to bargain in the markets, especially if you are their first customer of the day.

Tourist, local or age group. So the price different is huge. Have fun to tour around but you will find the stuff they try to sell are mostly similiar after a while, perhaps, major suppliers and dealers are feeding most of these retailers.

If you will have time check out Migliore first before heading to Insadong. I could have save more on my souvenirs if I bought them here. Main problem anywhere in Korea is the language barrier.
