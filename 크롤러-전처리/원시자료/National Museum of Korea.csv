0,5.0,Must see for every visitor to Seoul,It's easy to understand why this museum is one of the top visited museums in the world. The exhibits immerse visitors into the arts of the entire history of this country. Additional exhibits show the arts of the rest of Asia. These exhibits are newly installed and are very engaging. The gift shop is one of the best places to buy good quality gifts for friends or yourself. A variety of restaurants and coffee shops are also found on site., February 2020
1,5.0,World Class Museum!,"This museum is fantastic! I was very impressed by how rich and well-organized the museum is! The staff is wonderful! There are some robots that guide you and explain some of the most important treasures! The pieces are well-labelled. The museum is very well-curated. There are many highlights including the large pagoda in the first floor, the Sila jewellery, the pictorial work of the old tombs, the Buddha sculptures, the celadon, the porcelain, everything! The museum is free and it opens for long hours! We arrived in the afternoon. We stayed there for only 2 hours. The museum deserves at least half-day. I have to go back! We also walked around the museum. It has a sculpture garden and a beautiful lake with a pagoda.  The museum architecture is just special. Of interest, to see the sunset through the building is a memorable experience! There were very few visitors. It is a relaxing museum!It is very easy to find. You take the metro and walk a few meters from the station. The hallway that connects the metro with the museum is very interesting!", September 2019
2,5.0,A wonderful Museum....Free admission!,"I think it's awesome when a Museum offers free admission, especially to International travelers who can then learn all about a Country's Culture. My husband, son and I spent a week in Seoul, our very first trip to South Korea and visited the National Museum of Korea on our second day.It's a vast building, and one of the largest museums in Asia. We took the MRT to get there and it was a nice walk from the MRT station to the Museum. The Museum offers one hour free English language tours which we took. Our Guide was very friendly and personable and spoke English very well. There are also maps of the Museum available in English and they also detail the top sights if you have a limited amount of time to spend.I was fascinated most by the Gold Crowns and Caps, so delicate and ornate and so different from say English Crowns. :) The Museum houses many, many of Korean's National Treasures and it's really awe inspiring to get to see them and learn South Korea's history.You could spend a couple of days going through here no problem, plus there is another Museum on the grounds as well that is devoted to the Korean Language, the National Hangeul Museum.There is a large Food court area within in you get peckish and it serves really lovely meals. This is a great spot to visit if you're in Seoul. Go!!!!", January 2020
3,4.0,A well laid out tour through Korean history,"It helps if you read up on the basics of Korean history before you visit the museum, because it's a complicated story of multiple competing kingdoms rising and falling while simultaneously trying to fend off the Japanese and invaders from China. Fortunately, the museum explains this history in a series of wall boards in Korean and English. the exhibits cover everything from royal jewels to everyday life; something for everybody.", November 2019
4,5.0,An Exquisite and Informative Place.,"First of all the museum has 3 conveniently located Metro lines beneath its structure which will literally commute to and from anywhere within Seoul. The architecture as you will see in my pictures is superb and massive, very clean in the lines and overall well thought through and exquisitely designed.The day we went there was no entry fee so this was very convenient. Although overall the cultural activities in Seoul are not very expensive. Some 3.000 KW equivalent to some 3 US$ +/-.Inside the spaces are big and spacious, divided in several rooms on C shapes to be covered. Meaning: when you enter a room on the left and make a full square C, you will end up exiting the room on the far right, so this is very convenient cause the is no wrong or right in how to approach the rooms, it just flows and you cover great territory without even noticing.Some of the rooms are divided with names such as Ornaments and Art, Gojoseon and Han China, Tombs, Guardians and Deities. Also will be divided by different eras and dynasties.A room that did catch my attention and curiosity was the Furniture Room, where all the furniture was divided in Male and Female Furniture. You can see really here the differences in colors, lines, engravings and depictions on furniture that separates exquisitely both genders with style. Finally there is a coffee shop and a Gift shop conveniently located at the last floor (where you are suppose to finish). We do recommend this to everyone and definitely we had some 3 hours of pure cultural and informative fun.", January 2020
