0,5.0,It’s so huge!!!,They are so many unique fishes and entertaining shows. You can buy cute soft toys as a souvenir when you leave the place, March 2020
1,1.0,"If you like to see miserable animals in small tanks, sure...","Wasn’t aware that they had manatees before my visit. Manatees, seals and penguins all in VERY depressing enclosures. The manatee tank was completely bare and far too small for these animals. I found it quite upsetting and left swiftly after seeing these poor animals. Better conditions needed, this is the 21st century - have some compassion.", February 2020
2,3.0,Great for families with young children,I’ve been to many aquariums and thought this one was just okay. There were many families with small children and they were having a great time. There’s a lot of activities for kids . Interactive stations were cool. I went with my grown son and he didn’t enjoy it much. Definitely visit if you have small children. There’s a good variety of marine life. The layout of the place was great., January 2020
3,4.0,I wws blown away!,"We have a fantastic 'ocean world' in my home city, one of the best I've ever seen but this aquarium blew me away. It's huge and there's different themed areas as you go along. It's nicely set up and they had sealife that I had never seen in my life. I got a ticket online at Klook, which saved me about 20-25%. You can also get a flyer at the mall with a 15% discount coupon. The feedings are done by divers. The mermaid show I really wanted to see and waited around for an hour or so was a dissapointment...the 'mermaids' only swam up and down two or three times and then turnes into humans because that was their wish...I also didn't like the touching lab as I saw kids grabbingfish, starfish, poking them and taking them out and throwing them back in, no supervision. Other than that, great aquarium!!!", January 2020
4,3.0,Not worth the ticket price!,Tickets are over priced.Will not visit again.They had a decent variety of Marine life on display. Perhaps good to bring kids there., January 2020
5,5.0,Best aquarium ,"Not a fan of aquariums but this one was really great! Huge variety of amazing fish is never seen before, very curious and strange aquatic creatures. Huge tanks so lots of room to see and makes me feel at least a little bit better about the fish being kept captive. It’s got a lot of crazy stuff to see and the price is worth it.", December 2019
6,5.0,Coex aquarium,"Bought 4 tickets to coex aquarium via Klook and it cost us approx SGD$25 per pax...with the experience! Many interesting sea creatures (penguins, sharks, walruses etc). especially love their interactive stations where they allow u to touch the sea creatures (eg starfish, clams, fishes). They even have a fish spa area! Very suitable for families with children:) My elderly parents loved it too! Totally worth the trip ❤️ the layout of the whole area is v well thought out. Foreigners also get to experience a free hanbok experience:)", December 2019
7,4.0,Awesome time ,"First time to see piranha.Had an awesome time in COEX. The aquarium is just beautiful and highly recommended if you coming with your kids. Educational yet fun. The only feedback from me, all the show were in Korean language which for a foreigner like us could not understand. Other than that everything was good. Another spot to visit if you’re coming to Korea.", December 2019
8,2.0,Priority doesnt seem to be the animals,"After reading the reviews on tripadvisor, we were quite excited to go here. However, it just felt over priced.The whole theme is Octonauts, a kids tv show, so clearly it was aimed towards really young children. The fish habitats include the octonauts toys.Having been to many aquariums, the fish here just look quite miserable. Many of them felt lifeless and it's unclear if it's due to their environment being intruded by the colourful toys. The manatee aquarium especially looked too small for the beautiful creatures, who were staying at the bottom and could barely float vertically without having to bend. Too many tanks that were just too small.The place seemed to be centered around what kids want. It's bright and colourful. The baby shark song was playing throughout and almost drove me insane.The area for Doctor Fish to bite at your skin is not monitored. A kid put her whole hand in and started swishing the water violently. The touch pool was also not monitored. Kids could just lift up and throw the creatures without any care for the guidelines stated. More thought should be put into this.Feeding sessions are turned into ways to educate kids about the wildlife, which i thought was done very well. The amazonian wildlife area was also well constructed that i was amazed. Many of the fish were bigger than the ones i have seen in other places, which is also good. My favourite parts were the pairie dog enclosure, which is ironic since it is not a sea creature. The stamp collecting thing they have is pretty cool too, since i am a teenager and still willing to run around collecting them.Overall, the priority here seems to be the kids. However, the welfare of the animals should not be compromised in trying to do so. It felt a little sad to look at some of them. Aesthetic should always take a backseat when animals are involved.", December 2019
9,5.0,Must See,"The Aquarium is great for all ages. If you are there at the right time, there is shark feeding at 1:30pm and feeding for other select tanks at 3:30pm. They are very efficient and effective with the use they have and some of the smaller aquarium tanks are artistic design and fun for all ages. There is also one are where kids can tough sea creatures and one tank you can put your hands in and the fish will nibble the dead skin off.  The Aquarium is a good size and there is one place in there halfway through if you have a hankering for a snack or some ice cream. There are many places outside the aquarium where you can eat before or after. There is a fun stamp book for kids as they go through to find stamps along the way.", November 2019
10,5.0,Aquarium with many varieties,"I make it a point to see this aquarium every time I visit Seoul. Many varieties and I like their collection of exotic shrimps. A must-see in Seoul. Great for children and adults. I usually schedule to see it when the weather is not good for outdoor photography. Easily accessible by subway and is close to the Bongeunsa Temple too. The COEX has a spectacular book library on the ground floor, so next time when you visit the aquarium, visit also the library and the nearby temple. This year they have a chipmunk, in addition to prairie dogs.", October 2019
11,5.0,Top Aquarium,Really nice aquarium . a nice place. had a lot of activities around it to. a must visit place and you will not be dissappointed., October 2019
12,3.0,Decent but average,"COEX aquarium is interesting, but definitely catered more towards kids and families.  I like aquariums and have been to many, so I would rate this one overall as average.  Not fantastic, but a decent way to kill 2 hours if one has time to kill as well as about $25 to blow on admission.  There are lockers to store you stuff (no bags allowed).  Would I go back?  Meh, probably not, but only because of the cost vs. what you get.  I am not saying it's a waste of time, just not what I would do again knowing what I know now.", November 2019
13,5.0,Awesome experience albeit entrance areas looks simple,The fun is in the inner areas. Navigate to see crabs and otters inside. They're amazingly huge and colourful., October 2019
14,5.0,Great Aquarium. Learned a lot!,"I paid full price for ticket 28,000 not realising there is online discount I would have paid less. It wasn’t originally on my plan of places to go but a rainy day brought me to Coex. The aquarium is really great with lots of varieties of fish I have never seen before being from Europe. It’s really kid friendly and you can learn a lot from the signs that are in korean and english! Really enjoyed it as a solo traveler.", October 2019
15,5.0,wonderful !,"My family very love this place!! It's very beautiful, especially the Mermaid Show was really amazing !", October 2019
16,3.0,Expensive & not the best aquarium,"Don't get me wrong - if you have kids, it's a great interactive activity.As adults, having seen other aquariums, this is average. The exhibits are catering for children, so instead of trying to replicate natural habitats in the tanks, a lot have childish toys in them like a kids gold fish bowl.The aquarium does cover a range of different environments in the world - there's an Amazon rain forest including large otters. A desert area with phararie dogs. A section with manatees & then penguins. The viewing tunnel with sharks & rays doesn't have the larger species, but there is some impressive sharks.Overall, a good few hours if rainng or for the kids.Not the cheapest option so use your Discover Seoul pass to pay.", October 2019
17,5.0,Cute aquarium in town!,"My daughter soo happy in here. Many fish, and interactive features inside... for tourist, you can wear hanbok for free every weekdays, and take photo for free...First , i guess the aquarium was small.. but when you entered all the corner, i think this aquarium is quiet big. If you have family to travel with...  you should go to this place. Take subway to Bongeunsa Station. And follow the path to COEX  Aquarium.", September 2019
18,4.0,Very nice,"Nice place for a rainy day. Very cool sea animals.Cost 28,000 each. If you have kids they will enjoy", September 2019
19,5.0,An amazing experience/view,"Went on a rainy day and it was super fun :) a huge variety of fish and small animals, a very well designed halls  ( great to take pictures ) Worth it", September 2018
20,1.0,DONT DO IT!,"This is an overly commercial exploitation of living animals. We have visited many aquariums in the world and this one was one of the worst, the tanks were way too small for the animals within them, especially the larger animals like manatees, crocodile, and the larger fish that were swimming around the tank in circles, bumping into the glass walls and clearly very uncomfortable with the small size of the tank. There was a section where you could handle and touch sea creatures, and within this section, were dozens of tanks and no staff around, with little children poking and squeezing the creatures continually, whilst the parents sat on phones.The entire aquarium is overcrowded with tourists too, many of them are very pushy and disrespectful and will literally push you out of the way to get themselves in the front of the glass, there is no information about conservation or how to protect these animals, the place was very clearly set up to be a commercial hub.Just please dont do it, it is heartbreaking to see the animals trapped in such small and overcrowded tanks. AVOID", July 2019
21,4.0,Do something different with kids,The aquarium is pretty good with an assortment of displays and some unique creatures. It’s not unlike other good and modern aquariums around the world. It is a great change of pace from temples and palaces if you want to get out of the heat with kids., July 2019
22,3.0,it is good enough,"Just like other reviews here, the reason why we went to this aquarium is to fill out the use of our Discover Seoul Pass.  The entrance fee to Coex is on the high side and will easily justify the cost of the Discover Pass.  This is one of two aquariums that is available for entry by the Discover Pass, and this is one is much better, as the other one felt more like an oversized aqua pet shop.Some displays are in ponds, some are in big tanks, but a lot are in aquarium tanks sizes.  However, the aquarium tanks are big for a lot of the fishes, so these provide great viewing opportunities.  The fish spa experience allows one to feel the doctor fish nibble on your hand.The coex mall has also been upgraded, as compared to the last time I went here a long time ago,", June 2019
23,4.0,A surprisingly nice aquarium in the heart of Seoul,"We went to Coex aquarium because it is part of the Discover Seoul Pass and we can enter for free if we bought the pass.  We were really not interested in going to the aquarium at first as we have been to a lot of big aquariums, so we were not expecting something great from an aquarium in a mall.  Please note that I am an avid Aquarist and I love to visit public aquariums, my kids also love them as well.When we got there though we were happily surprised, the aquarium was well presented, the layout was nice and the exhibits were well kept.  I think there was some confusion about the two types of Arawanas though, as they bunched both the asian ones and the amazon ones in the same area.  They also had a few Mammals on exhibit, the Prairie dogs and the African Manatees were really cute, and we were lucky that we were there during feeding time. Penguins were also nice as well.The kids loved the experience of the Garra Rufa or Fish spa fish, after they were asked to wash their hands and then put them in the tank with the fish, the kids stayed there for maybe 10minutes.If I were to give improvement suggestions to the aquarium, I would say, put more explanation on all the exhibits, environment, diet, conservation status, etc.  and also make sure english translation is accurate.  I can say that the exhibits is comparable to the Ocean Park aquarium in Manila, except that they do not have the outdoor shows, which is fine by me.  One new thing that the kids learned at the aquarium is how to determine if a shark is male or female!I would say that we all loved the ""Nursery"" where we saw baby seahorses and pregnant male seahorses, the Axolotl is also a favorite of my kids. I would highly recommend going to this Aquarium if you love fishes.", June 2019
24,4.0,wow there's Piranha!!,Big Aquarium inside the COEX Mall. Well maintained with lots of sea creatures to see. the main attractions were the diving penguins and the Piranha fish! very  informative and a good place to go to if you'd want to rest from the humid weather outside esp.during Summer Months in Seoul (June), June 2019
25,3.0,There are better things to do in Seoul.,"This aquarium is nothing special at all. Do not expect to be wowed by anything unique or creative. Unless you have never been to an aquarium or have children that demand you take them there, do not waste your time and skip this activity. There are better things to do in Seoul.", May 2019
26,5.0,Impressive ,"A really fun and visually impressive aquarium. The layout and design of each area is well thought out. Multiple observation rooms give great opportunities to see a large number of unique, beautiful fishies and other animals! Add this place to your ""must see"" list if you are in the area.", May 2019
27,5.0,Entertainment for everyone,"One of the best things about Coex Aquarium according to our 3 years old girl are the Octonauts. She was more impressed with a room where she could push a button and start the song, than with all the sharks, fish, turtles and other amazing beings.It was also interesting to see the feeding.And the navigation system with stamping was also nice.Overall we had a great time there. Maybe would like to have a bit more buttons and Octonauts around. That was the girl’s opinion.", April 2019
28,5.0,Amazing and entertaining ,My husband and I decided to visit the Coex Aquarium when we were in Coex mall and it was one of the highlights of our trip to Seoul! You can see many different interesting sea animals! Highly recommended!, March 2019
29,4.0,Good can add more description,Good Aquarium in the COEX shopping mall如果可以多點介紹部份或互動部份更好。例如短片介紹或iPad 遊戲等。 希望下次可以見到鯊魚位置表演 或其他關於魚類嘅介紹節目。, March 2019
30,3.0,"Great to look at, but not really informative.",Not a lot of information on display. Might be better for kids. Not really somewhere you NEED to go to when in Seoul., March 2019
31,3.0,A place for kids,"They have quite a few interesting exhibits that I have not seen in other aquariums but overall, the place is built for kids and the adults might find it boring if they've been to other aquariums.", March 2019
32,4.0,Worth to be there!,"Very nice place for everyone interested in nature. Worth to go there especially when the weather is bad :) Staff is nice and helpful, speak in English. I really like part ""Story about Korean fish""!", March 2019
33,5.0,Nice and clean,Lots of things to see. Nicely decorated. Big and spacious.  My kids (8 and 2 years old) enjoyed a lot. There are also some interactive exhibits that you can touch the sea creatures., December 2018
34,4.0,Unique and Quirky,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Coex Aquarium - the first aquarium I have ever seen inside of a shopping mall. It was a bit overpriced, even with the tourist discount we got thanks to a travel brochure we picked up at the airport. The displays are quirky and unique, and even boasted some sea life, such as manatees, which we hadn't seen in any of our aquariums back home. Overall, a fun experience and a lovely outing if you have kids or if you are looking for something to do indoors on a very cold and/or rainy day.", March 2018
35,4.0,A good aquarium with varieties,"If you like aquariums, it is a must-see in Seoul. I liked to visit the aquarium whilst in Seoul (especially when the weather was bad and the parks were wet). This was my second visit and there was no noticeable change. However, watching the various creatures in the aquarium was quite relaxing and entertaining. This time, I tried to refine my camera skills for shooting tropical fishes; the results were not bad.", October 2018
36,4.0,Suitable for a trip with children,"The aquarium is huge, and many interesting exhibits suitable for a trip with kids. The place is also quite spacious and not crowded on weekdays.", November 2018
37,3.0,Fun spot for kids.,"The COEX Aquarium in Gangnam area of Seoul is one of the largest aquariums in South Korea, it boasts having over 40,000 creatures from over 650 species on display. Its nicely laid out with a well signed route which snakes its way through the various tanks and exhibits, most of the tanks have write ups in English. There are a lot of fun little activities dotted around for younger children to enjoy, although these are more geared to speakers of Korean. Not all the exhibits are aqautic, I walked around one corner to find a rabbit!! Highlights - The under ""sea"" tunnel, the jellyfish tanks and the otters.", November 2018
38,5.0,A great Day inside,Our son loved the aquarium. If you need to spend a day inside this is a great place to do it. There are a ton of people there however so go early., November 2018
39,3.0,Save it for the children,"We have visited many aquariums around the world and to be honest we found this one quite bizarre - plastic toys and cartoon characters in the fish tanks, video game machines next to the displays, the mermaid/clown fish show, rabbits and prairie dogs, vending machines everywhere so you were constantly trying to avoid bumping into people who were eating and drinking. The otter, beaver and penguin enclosures were really depressing. Having said that  it was very busy the day we visited and there were many families with young children who seemed to be enjoying it, but I would find it hard to recommend to anyone else.", October 2018
40,5.0,interesting....aquatic view,"lovely experience ,mesmerising water world, it was indeed a experience to watch the colourful water world at the Coex aquarium,it was convent form the Coex convention centre", October 2018
41,4.0,"Octonauts, get ready!","This is a fun aquarium for young kids. In contrast to the educational scientific approach, this aquarium focuses on being fun and lively. First part of aquarium had ovtonauts related displays, then there is a place where you can touch “doctor fish” and star fish. There is also a shark area and some penguins. It’s a nice place to spend about 90 mins with kids under seven, but not much larger than that.", October 2018
42,5.0,"Good and nice, but pricy.",I have been here three times in four years and all was good.  Pros: 1. Nice and clean aquarium.2. A lot of varieties3. Nice Ambience.4. Not tiring5. Photo areas6. Nicely instructed7. Good/Great staffsCons 1. Overpriced.  I have visited it before and the price was half of it. Suddenly increased the price., May 2018
43,5.0,Lots to see and do,The price is a bit expensive if you're on a a budget but I think it's well worth it. The aquarium is so quirky with some of the displays but also very good at taking care of the animals. There are lots of different exhibits and activities to take part in this place would be especially good of you have children traveling with you as they would in my opinion love it. Plenty of bathrooms and vending machines so was never thirsty or needing the loo. All of the staff that I encountered were very nice too, December 2017
44,4.0,Great for Young Kids,"The aquarium was definitely better than I thought especially you pay 27,000 Korean won ($25). Well-designed with many different fishes I’ve never seen before. It’s an interactive experience where you can actually touch a few sea creatures. If your kids have never been to an aquarium, this is not a bad choice to make. It was enjoyable.", September 2018
45,5.0,A very enjoyable experience ,"Lots to see, very well displayed with lots of information also in English - many creatures that we hadn’t seen before in aquariums in England. Funny that they put fish in random things like a phone box and fridge. Would definitely recommend a visit if you like sea creatures. Loved the otters they were so cute !!", August 2018
46,4.0,Suitable for families with young children,"Went there at 12pm with a group of young kids over the summer. Just in time to catch the sea animals feeding schedule. There was a small touch pool and also a hand spa from doctor fish. What an experience for the kids! It took us about 3 hours to finish the whole thing as we also took quick snack break. There is a snack café which sells hot dog, sausage, ice cream and drinks. There are many drinks vending machine in the aquarium too. If you simply want to see some sea marine, the tour usually takes 1-1.5 hours.", August 2018
47,3.0,"Average aquarium content, + for clean tank windows!","Me and my family likes to visit the aquarium(s) in the towns and countries we are visiting. Coex Aquarium was pretty average when it comes to content, as soon as you ""forget"" or ""scratch out"" the fact that there are plastic toys and lego buildings in some of the tanks for the small fishes. I had never seen sea-cows in real life, so that was definetly a new one for me! A big positive was that they seem to keep the tanks clean and also the glasses/windows. If you like aquariums and aren't bothered about a few toys and lego buildings among the fishes, I would recomend this as an activity :).", July 2018
48,5.0,The most beautiful Aquarium I've ever seen,"This has got to be the most amazing attraction that I visited while in Seoul. The Aquarium is smartly divided into different sections so visitors (especially children) can learn a lot of things about marine life. It's great for families, friends, and couples too. The best thing about Coex aquarium is that a wide range of species can be found here and they all are displayed creatively. The mermaid show was amazing as well. The whole place is clean and spacious. I would love to visit it again!", July 2018
49,5.0,Feast for senses,Amazing variety of sea life displayed in most imaginative surroundings like kitchen sinks and fire extinguishers. And why not!! Impressive larger animals like rays were fascinating. This place is more than its location under a super mall promises. The only negative was missing supervision as children were touching some petting animals much more than recommended - parental guidance is obviously not enough..., September 2017
50,5.0,Place for everyone to visit,"The place was surprisingly bigger than I expected and they have a huge variety of species on display. The displays were organized and has a theme which was interesting. There was an experiential part of the aquarium where visitors get a chance to get close and even touch the creatures. However, there was no staff to supervise the visitors. There are also rest areas for families with children and vendo machines to buy refreshments. They also have a scheduled shows.The place is great  for families, couples, and even for solo travellers. There is more to this place than just fish so be sure to visit. It is also very near SM Town musuem.", June 2018
51,2.0,Disappointing,"Was supposed to be a highlight of our trip to Seoul.While the whole attraction, as a whole, was really good, the touch pool was appalling. I am all for aquariums allowing their guests to touch the different kinds of sea creatures on display for education but i strongly feel that these interactions must be closely, and strictly, monitored by staff. This was absent at COEX. Kids (I don't blame them, I blame their parents / adult guardians) were squeezing these poor creatures. I am very sure that these creatures were feeling tortured. If there's no staff to supervise, don't open the touching pool.To further my disappointment, there was a sign saying that feeding for the pirahnas was starting at a certain time but it never happened.In all honesty, the only positive I took from the visit was that I got to see turtles and a cowfish.Unless COEX improves their standards, I will never visit the aquarium again.", June 2018
52,4.0,Great Place for Knowledge,"Went here on a weekday around 1pm. They have special shows which are usually done in the afternoon starting at 1:30pm. We bought our tickets online via Klook which was about $2 cheaper than buying it in-store.Overall experience was great, although there were a number of tanks that do not contain the species being described on the signboards.We spent more than 3 hours there because we tried to watch all the available shows and read almost all descriptions shown on the tanks.", June 2018
53,5.0,Great experience for young children,"This was one of the better aquariums we have seen and the exhibits were set up in way which was interesting and fun for young children. We finished the walk through the exhibits within two hours, but missed the shows which tend to be in the afternoon, particularly over the weekend - there are less shows on weekdays.", June 2018
54,4.0,Lovely place for kids!,"This aquarium is Octonaut-themed, and my boy loves it! There are many different areas, classified based on geographical zones, with petting area to interact with the marine creatures. This place is highly recommended for families with kids.", June 2018
55,3.0,Good if you have small kids,"We saw great reviews about this Aquarium so stopped by. I guess if you have small kids, it's a great place for them to wander around. If not, well, don't expect Sea World. It's a pretty compact (& a bit handmade) aquarium that is part of the mall.", May 2018
56,4.0,Worth a visit,"It is surprisingly large given that it is situated inside the COEX, an expensive place in the heart of the city. I had visited numerous large aquariums but still managed to find something interesting. There was a locker facility (at a small charge) and that was helpful. The staff were particularly helpful although they did not speak much English.", April 2018
57,5.0,Enormaous,"Surprised how big this place is once we were inside.  Great collections, and children's program.  Nice and clean. Enjoyed it.", May 2018
58,4.0,Better than expected,We didn’t expect much as it was a last minute decision to visit.It was a weekday so the crowd was few and far in between.The variety of animal was a surprise. Although it was meant to be an aquarium but we also got to see prairie dogs and beavers.The sardine show was good and entertaining. Would recommend if you have a few hours to spare., April 2018
59,4.0,Fun for couples ❤,"My boyfriend and I went to the COEX aquarium over the weekend and it was one of our best days in Seoul. We spent quite a bit of time here exploring and reading about the many different types of fish and mammals.The draw card for me was the manatee enclosure, you're able to get quite close and observe them. There is a seating area in between the manatee and seal enclosure so you can chill out for a while and watch them.  The aquarium also has feeding times, so if you're lucky, you can see your favourite's in action or at least plan around that. All the enclosures are well looked after and the staff are friendly and helpful.I also found the first part of the exhibitions interesting, as it had a full history of Korean fish, which my boyfriend enjoyed a lot too. While they're not as pretty as the tropical fish, they're interesting to learn about.The cost is 28,000KRW each for adults which was worth it in my opinion. To get to COEX Starfield Mall you need to catch line 2 (green line) on the Seoul Metro and disembark at Samseong station. There are many signs in both Korean and English which will guide you to the Aquarium.All in all I definitely recommend this aquarium!", April 2018
60,5.0,"Fun, kid-friendly, beautifully maintained aquarium","My husband and I took our 6 month old baby to the aquarium on a rainy day and had a wonderful time! We were amazed at how beautifully maintained and clean all the tanks in the aquarium are. The animals seem very well taken care of. We especially enjoyed the quirky section of the aquarium where fish are living in all sorts of funny places - a telephone booth, glass lanterns, tupperware inside a refrigerator, etc. It was entertaining for our baby as well as us adults. I would definitely go back!", December 2017
61,2.0,Boring Aquarium,looks like the concept has been brought without giving adequate thoughts to make it stand out compared to its peers.Very expensive to the boot, October 2017
62,5.0,Entertaining!,"This aquarium has the greatest variety of fish I´ve ever seen! It even has penguins! I really liked the theme each room had and you can even touch some of the creatures there, like the starfish. Great for family trips!", February 2018
63,3.0,Not very big but an easy way to spend a couple of hours.,"The aquarium is tucked away in the mall, but easy enough to find with adequate signs pointing the way. It was a bit underwhelming but large enough to keep you entertained for a couple of hours.", October 2017
64,5.0,Best Aquarium ever,I've done some Aquariums but this one is really well-done. There are a lot of animals that I didn't have the chance to see before that day. The visit will take you around 2 or 3 hours. The entrance is around 20 euros but it's totally worth it :), May 2017
65,5.0,incredible!,i was first a little taken-aback by how up close and personal you are with apex predators and the lot... it was absolutely a one of a kind unique experience  that none of us will forget! if youre out here for some unholy reason do yourself a favor and dedicate a couple hours here!!!, June 2017
66,3.0,Ok,"It was an ok experience, but way too expensive for what it has to offer. Not impressive and the entrance was around 25000w.", March 2018
67,4.0,It was very good,"Many species. Not only under sea habitats. So very interesting, large main pool with big sharks and turtles. Worth it", March 2018
68,5.0,surprisingly worth it,"you'd think an aquarium inside the basement of a mall would be lacklustre, but wow you'd be wrong. This place is huge and has so many different areas. You can spend a couple hours in here easily. It has pretty much all the staples of a good aquarium. There's a shark tank, otters, an underwater tunnel, educational things, jelly fish, and some extra trendy stuff. It isn't the best aquarium I've been to by far, but it gets a 5star simply because it was way better than expected. Easily accessible by subway and you can spend a whole day here if you like malls. Watch a movie, eat some food, go to a temple across the street, go to an arcade all on a subway stop. This place is also one stop on bus from the airport for about 15 bucks. So even a great stop over spot when in Korea", November 2017
69,4.0,Great afternoon activity,Our family of five had a wonderful time in the Coex Aquarium! Many different areas to explore and Santa was diving with the fish! There were lots of kids and families but never felt too crowded. Lots to see and fun exhibits! There was a food festival on the front of the Coex on this particular year day and we had a great lunch! The Aquarium was the perfect place to get out of the cold!, December 2017
70,5.0,Great for kids,"Was a great day out with the kids, as shopping mall next door. We spent about 2 hrs there, very easy to get to. Great indoor activity if weather is bad.", December 2017
71,4.0,Impressive,"Mixed feelings about aquaria. first of all not all sea creatures are truly beautiful to look at... secondly, similar to zoos it can be somewhat sad to see these animals in small tanks....That being said, the children loved this aquarium. it builds up well. the start is quite modest and includes some rather weird settings as well as animals (bunnies, ferrets, hamsters/chipmunks). But at any rate they have a full selection ranging from sweet water river fish that are probably more culturally relevant to Koreans all the way to jelly fish, turtles, sharks, eels, moray, sting ray etc.The beginning of the tour seems to cater to small children with an octonaut theme. Towards the end you're able to see 6+ feet shark, stingray that look like mini-flying-carpets the size of a coffee table...", December 2017
72,4.0,Best Aquarium seen till now,Visited this Aquarium alone at Coex mall. Centrally located and provide best view of all varieties of marine life's. Best time to go alone with friends and family members., December 2017
73,5.0,The best aquarium I have ever been ,"This is the best aquarium I have been so far. The environment is really good, kids have opportunity to touch in some kind of attractions alive, the glasses surrounding the aisle give us an impressive sensation and kids are surprised all the time.", December 2017
74,4.0,“Interesting display of fishes”,"Been to Seoul a couple of times and this is our first visit to the aquarium.  The aquarium is located in coex mall with plenty of shopping and restaurants. The aquarium itself wasn’t big, you can basically cover the whole place in a hour or so. There are some very innovative display of the fishes in this place, eg a water dispenser filled with fishes, a fire extinguisher acts as a fish tank etc. Pretty interesting! The rest are pretty much your usual aquarium stuffs. Go if you are traveling with young kids, they will love the place.", December 2017
75,1.0,Desapointed!,"This Aquarium it's nothing special! It depends a lot on what have you saw before. So, if you have been before in great aquariums forget about this one, it's small and has nothing special to see and it seams that they don't take very well care about the animals there. But if you are with little kids and don't know what to do i thing you can go there and enjoy.", March 2017
76,4.0,Coex Aquarium with lots of fishes,I visited the Coex Aquarium with a friend. There were plenty of different types of fishes and is an interesting place for fish lovers. I’m posting photos to show the fishes., October 2017
77,5.0,Water wonderland,"This is a must see for visitors to Seoul. Wonderfully laid out, allow time to see all the exhibits. They are diverse, and children are especially catered for with interactive games. One of the best laid out aquariums we have visited. Many species to excite interest with waterfalls and ponds an attractive addition.", October 2017
78,4.0,Well designed aquarium,"Prefer this aquarium to lotte world aquarium, since it felt as though it was larger and had a larger variety of marine lives. A lot of thinking seemed to have been placed into the designing of the aquarium's layout and furnishing to elude an air of cozy ambiance throughout the visit, even though I felt that some tanks might be too children-friendly for adults - had to squat down at most of the first section. The staff at the ticket counter could have been friendlier as well, as she looked irritated when she found out that I couldn't understand Korean and that she had to repeat herself in another language.", November 2017
79,5.0,Quirky Aquarium!!,"We visited as part of an organised tour, this is a good little aquarium with fish in a variety of quirky settings. Its well worth a visit and not too expensive.", October 2017
80,3.0,A kids friendly aquarium,"The aquarium is located within Coex mall and is designed to be kids friendly. It was interest to see innovative way of displaying the fishes in the aquarium, like retrofitting an old telephone broth into a fish tank.", October 2017
81,5.0,Excellent ,"Spent 2,5 amazing hours with 4 children aged 2 to 9 in this aquarium!  Highly recommend to anyone with and without children", October 2017
82,4.0,Great fun for small children ,"This place is much better than the one at the Coex Centre in Seoul. My 7-year-old had a great time there, especially feeding the fish. Really liked the variety of fish and animals. You can buy discounted tickets through Gmarket. You can do the aquarium in the morning and Kidsania in the afternoon if you have enough energy. Kids will have a perfect day.", October 2017
83,5.0,Compact  and nice - worth a visit even at this price,"I visited this Coex aquarium on the last day at Seoul after attending a conference. After checking out at the hotel, I could take the hand luggage into the aquarium and walk around (that was the reason - to pass time while hanging on to my hand luggage). Within the coex mall the aquarium is nicely planned with lot of species - sharks, penguins, live corals. Full price is high, but you get instant 15% discount with the coupon you find there. I guess the locals get better discounts when they bring their kids.It takes about two hours to see the aquarium leisurely. There are places inside to sit and watch the marine life for longer. It cannot be any better.", September 2017
84,5.0,Pretty damn impressed ,"Arrived at coex mall for some shopping and decided to hit the Aquarium first with our 4 year old; she loves sea creatures!We've been to a fair few aquariums around the world and this one has a really cute and quirky display. We really enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and so did our daughter. The doctor fish part was probably our favourite. Lots of fresh water sea life from all part of Asia, really interesting to see. Would definitely visit again", September 2017
85,5.0,One of my favorite aquariums,"My expectations were low for an aquarium in a shopping mall, but the Coex Aquarium houses an incredible variety of animals.", October 2016
86,4.0,Nice place to spend sometime for fun,Its a very big aquarium with so many separate sections for fishes and animals. Saw different and unique varieties of fishes and sea creatures. It took 2 hrs approximately for us to finish the tour of aquarium. Overall a good place., August 2017
87,4.0,Good for a young toddler,"The best thing about this aquarium is that it's not very big, which is ideal for a little toddler - it's just nice for him and and spent a few hours here. Don't expect to see aquariums like seaworld etc and you'll enjoy it", July 2017
88,5.0,Beautiful aquarium,"Spent 3 hours here one afternoon.  Well worth the price; make sure you take a picture at the poster in the mall for 10% off.  It's inside the mall, and a little hard to find, but once inside, it is a blast! So many different fish tanks, and so much to see.  The shark tank at the end is amazing, and big enough to really make you feel like you're inside the ocean!  Well worth the price.", September 2017
89,2.0,"Loved the Aquarium, hated all the noise","I truly enjoyed the aquarium and the way they had some of their displays set up. The only downside for me was that there were several very young school groups who were all yelling and running. They have one spot where they play soothing music and you can fit in front of a massive aquarium where sharks and rays glide by in front of you. It would have been a great spot to sit and video the beautiful creatures but there several groups of very loud teenage Korean boys running through it ruining your video and generally ruining the whole feeling. It would have been an awesome experience if the staff had maintained some kind of order, but most of them appeared to be high school kids themselves.", August 2017
90,4.0,Enjoyed the aquarium and a great excuse to see the rest of the mall,"We were shopped out since we were staying in Myeongdong and the idea of going to a pricey mall wasn't appealing, but I figured at the very least we should check out the Gangnam neighborhood made famous by the singer Psy and if we got bored we could go to the aquarium.Firstly, the mall is pretty awesome looking. We didn't see anything extraordinary at the shops but loved the library in the wide open middle space. It was a trek to find the aquarium but we did and passed a sign offering foreign visitors a 10 percent discount if you took a picture of the sign, so we were able to snag a discount to boot. We didn't have the highest of expectations and were pleasantly surprised. We love aquariums and have been to various ones in the US, Sydney, Vancouver, Singapore etc. I wouldn't say this collection was unusual but it was nicely presented including my favorite of a phone booth filled with small fish. They also had transformed other ordinary objects into tiny aquariums. When we arrived we raced to an otter feeding but it was in Korean with no translation so we left after a bit to enjoy wandering around. The aquarium was much larger than we expected and we spent more than an hour there. I also enjoyed the large shark and stingray tank, again not unusual but still cool to see.", August 2017
91,5.0,Awesome Aquarium!,"Best aquarium I've ever been to.Not normally one to visit aquariums but we visited after a full day tour of Panjumeon and the DMZ and needed a change of pace.We only had 90 minutes here as they were closing..easily could have spent more time here.The themed areas are very cute and I loved their inventive displays - especially the area with fish displayed in phone booths and fridges! Great wee bit where you can lie on a bed and just watch fish. Enjoyed the musical fish who interact with their space creating random notes. Impressive shark tank, and installations and the English translations of the different fish are very cute. Only down side - some animals need larger enclosures.", May 2017
92,1.0,Don't Go! Merchants of Death Ahead!,"Aquarium is okay, not really spectacular but not bad. It is in my mind a good educational experience for children.However parents  are terrible at controlling their children. People touch the fish in the tanks even though people are prohibited to do so (Korean and Chinese were the only one we saw doing so at that time). In the Marine Touch Lab it is even worse, there are clear instructions how to behave and what to do. However parents with seriouse dillusions of grandeur, think the animals are indestructable and people just manhandle them. Here are some suggestions:*Close off the tanks so people cannot touch the animals.*Discontinue the touch zone because people are re~￦@%d and cannot behave themselves.", August 2017
93,5.0,Our Summer July 2016,We went here July 2016 with our daughter. We love coex and it was beautiful but we do not manage to see the live show., September 2016
94,2.0,In deed an Aquarium,"My son was utterly disappointed after reaching the site, it's rather small. And compared to other Aquariums in Hong kong, singapore and Thailand it's nothing.", July 2017
95,4.0,a nice tour for an empty hour,"well designed in the center of an underground mall adjacent to the COEX conference center and the Grand Intercontinental hotel. Rich in items, especially nice for children.", June 2017
96,5.0,Entertaining journey ,We bought the tickets for 25k each. Well spent.We where in there for about 2-3 hours. There were alot of activities for both adult and children to enjoy.They had a good variety of different fish., July 2017
97,5.0,Good educational experience ,"An educational experience and fun for all ages, well organised and friendly staff, sardine love show is so enchanting.", July 2017
98,3.0,"Good, but a little overpriced","We went on a Monday and it wasn't very crowded. The main attraction is the huge aquarium with sharks, manta rays, and turtles which was quite impressive. Everything else felt like it was just filler. Great for small kids though. Lots of activities to keep them engaged.We paid 50,000 Won for 2 people and I felt for what was offered it was a bit overpriced. Wouldn't go again necessarily, but I didn't regret going in the first place.", July 2017
99,5.0,Amazing Aquarium,There were species we had never seen before and some which we did not expect to see in an Aquarium --lovely collection by any standards and definitely worth the visit, May 2017
100,4.0,A really nice aquarium.,"We went here with our 2 boys, aged 6 & 2.They had a blast looking at all the different fish, stingrays, sharks, turtles and other sea life. They even had some other animals such as Beavers, Otters and Penguins. This aquarium was nicely laid out with 16 different stations. I would allocate around 1-2 hours for this attraction. I think some of the main features of this aquarium are the Huge ""Ocean Kingdom"" with all the sharks, The Fish in Wonderland which show fish in all diferent types of unique aquariums, The Amazonia World which show marine life from The Amazon River and The Marine Touch Lab to where the kids can touch certain marine life. This attraction is stroller friendly. My only drawback would be that this attraction is sort of on the pricey side with adults costing 25,000 each, youths 22,000 and children (3-12) 19,000 krw.", June 2017
101,5.0,Always great to visit,"This was our second visit to the aquarium.  Hours of wonder and fun with the fish and other animals, including the otters, beavers, penguins... My teenage son still loved the squirrel most, but we all enjoyed the colours and tranquility of the aquariums.  Well worth the visit.", June 2017
102,4.0,Enjoyable,"We enjoyed walking around, learning & viewing.  It's a good aquarium, but not great (like Singapore).Loved the quirky house area where marine life were in everyday home areas: bed heads, fridges, kitchen sinks, etc", May 2017
103,4.0,Nice aquarium at fantastic mall,"We have been twice. The first time we absolutely loved this aquarium. The second time it was a little different. Zoos and aquariums are always a little sad when looking at how small the enclosures are for the animals/sea creatures. If you are able to look passed this then you will enjoy the aquarium very much, like we did the first time!", April 2017
104,4.0,A fun place with your loved ones ,"I enjoyed this place with my wife and we had a fun time checking out the fish and it was a lovely place and when you are done can you eat lunch in Coex. It is not a must see, but fun place if you lived her for a longer time or if you have kids.", April 2017
105,3.0,Aquarium,This was a nice sized aquarium where you could get close to the fish and exhibits.  It would be a great place to go with kids., May 2017
106,5.0,Amazing!,"We were pleasantly surprised that Coex Aquarium can rival the SEA Aquarium in Singapore.  Considering that Coex Aquarium was inside a mall, we did not expect much.  We were pleasantly surprised to see that it was very modern and had as much attractions as SEA Aquarium in Singapore.  They even had penguins and huge sharks which my kids really enjoyed watching.  And for its price, it was well worth it!", May 2017
107,3.0,Value for money is not so good,"Frankly speaking the value for money is not so good in Coex Aquarium. There are not so many animals here, this attraction is more for chldren than for adults even though there were some interesting spots. However I will not recommend a visit to this aquarium and if I could come back to the past I would save 25000 Wons/ticket and skip this attraction. COEX shopping mall itself is not very interesting also, however it is a kind of must-see in Seoul as it is considered to be one of the biggest in the world.", May 2017
108,5.0,Great Aquarium at Gangnam!,I have been to several aquariums but this is by far the best. Great tour inside plus a show as well!! Nice experience for people of ALL ages!, May 2017
109,5.0,Feeling like under the Ocean,This is one of the good places to visit with families. You will find various specious of sea fishes and ocean hunters like sharks., October 2016
110,3.0,Could be better,"We love visiting the aquarium at every single city we travel if it has one. Seoul was not an exception and we chose COEX as we were told a lot about it. The entrance was easily found. Staff was friendly. The aquarium seemed to be large and well organized with some areas where guest could play with the fish and ocean creatures. The big fish and penguin, however, looked so tired and boring. Since we were there around 11am with no show at that time so we did not really enjoy it. But I think it could be much better once the renovation is completed.", April 2017
111,4.0,Nice and Cool!,"This is one of a good places to visit during in Seoul, especially for the aquamarine lovers. This is definitely a cool place with the very nice decorations but a bit expensive. But overall, it's such a lovely place to visit either with family, partner or friends.", April 2017
112,5.0,Fun and whimsical,This place located within the Coex Center is one of the must-sees in Seoul. They have a vast variety of species exhibited. They provide interactive activities for children. It is amazing how clean and maintained the aquariums are., April 2017
113,2.0,Below Average Aquarium,"This aquarium caters to families with small children.  If this isn't you, go elsewhere.  If it is you, you and your children will have a very nice time.", March 2017
114,5.0,An Underwater Adventure,"Coex Aquarium is a combination of Marine Fish & Brackish Water fishes in the Amazon jungle. It highlights fishes in their natural habitats able to live together with other kinds. For the marine fishes, there's a section where children are allowed to handle live corals, starfishes, hernit crabs & even a baby octopus. There is also a tank full of Piranhas looking so aggressive & unfriendly. It usually takes about 90 mins to complete everything. Coming out of the Aquarium, you will be able to buy souvenirs to bring home.Highlight is the feeding times when 4 divers get into the water to hand feed the fishes, octopus, sting ray & mantle ray. They also performed some water aerobics to entertain the audience in the theatre.", April 2017
115,4.0,Well presented,"Coex Aquarium is fun and interesting especially for young kids. My daughter is 3.10 years old, thus, still free; payment starts at 4 if I am not mistaken. The map at the start of the ""journey"" makes going around more interesting as one needs to complete the stamp from several stops and get a post card after. There are a lot of variety of sea creatures and they eat healthy foods, fruits and veggies! A nice place to visit and takes around 1-2 hours in total. =)", April 2017
116,4.0,Good aquarium but overpriced,"Aquarium is in the Coex Mall. Great use of mirrors makes it look much bigger than it is.Some clever displays such as panels in drink vending machines, in old phone boxes, household items for smaller fish.I spent 2.5hrs there and enjoyed it. Good variety of fish and animals such as otters, prairie dogs, bats and squirrels.  Sharks are a decent size as are the rays. The manatees were my favorite though.  Compared to other aquariums this is overpriced.  It cost 2500 won to enter. A nice way to spend a few hrs. Accessible from the green line Sameosung station.", April 2017
117,5.0,Fun & Educational in Convenient Location,"Some people might balk at the price, but it's worth it if you go as a group. It's a very nice aquarium with plenty of English information for visitors. We went as a school trip for students who were mostly English speakers and they really enjoyed it.", December 2016
118,3.0,Good for children,"The place is overrun with children and definitely geared towards them in my opinion.  We were 3 adults, and we of course still enjoyed all the sea life, but we did not enjoy the crowds.  I would avoid weekends if possible.", August 2016
119,4.0,Good place to chill and stroll,Enough to see when you want to get out of the cold. There are good signage to each exhibit. Before the entrance and inside there are lockers for storing your bags., February 2017
120,4.0,New fish I hadn't seen,"This is a standard aquarium in that there are lots of tanks of fish. However they had one room laid out with tanks showing what would be from the beginning of the Han river to the sea. It also has what lives in a paddy field. There are unusual fish tanks (one uses a refrigerator ). There were also otters, beers and manatees.", February 2017
121,4.0,Coex,"Good aquarium. Entrance fee is 25,000 KRW. Great location in Gangnam. The one in Busan is probably better", February 2017
122,5.0,Worthwhile outing ,"This aquarium started out ho-hum...then got interesting! I especially liked the 'Dr Fish' that nibbled my fingers. My kids especially liked the touch-and-feel section as well as the microscopes that magnified tiny aquatic creatures. I'm happy we went. Just outside a metro stop - super easy to access. Part of an underground mall, so plenty of dining and coffee options for before or after.", January 2017
123,5.0,Great family diversion,"This is a nice aquarium with some unique features I hadn't seen previously. We enjoyed the uniquely Korean fish tank displays (in a coke machine, a water cooler, a phone booth, etc.), and the sardine show (where divers divert the schooling fish in various directions) is a spectacle to behold. Among the many exhibits is a big shark tank with some interesting varieties and some of the largest sharks and rays I recall seeing at an aquarium. The ""doctor fish"" (nibbling pedicure fish) exhibit was a fun hands-on experience. Lots to see here, and a great place to spend a few hours with the kids in inclement weather, especially since it's attached to a mall with lots of restaurants. We didn't find it too crowded, especially considering that it was a weekend during the cold winter. Note that the experience is linear, so you'll need to pass through the entire facility to get out.", December 2016
124,4.0,COEX Aquarium Visit,"This a nice aquarium in the middle of the city and about five minutes from the nearest subway stop.  However, it is far too crowded, making it difficult to view the exhibits in a relaxing manner.  The exhibits are modern and professional.", June 2016
125,3.0,Typical Tropical Aquarium,"We visited the aquarium due to the bad outdoor weather and we have a couple of hours to kill. This aquarium is like any other aquarium, plenty of tropical species of fish, sharks, rays etc. The layout of the place is more or less similar to other public aquariums, with a tunnel to view the ocean creatures. I have been to better ones in my opinion. A good place to visit if you have time to kill and you have a restless child in tow. Skip this attraction if you have other places to visit.", December 2016
126,4.0,Interesting,"I didn't expect a huge Aquarium inside a mall. It looked small when viewed from the entrance, but you'll be surprised how bit it actually is. It had different themes and a good variation of fish and other animals.", March 2016
127,4.0,Good experience at aquarium in Gangnam mall,"We visited the aquarium at the CoEx Mall one evening before closing.  It was over $20 for admission.  A little more than expected.  We enjoyed our hour going through all the various exhibits.  They even had a beaver exhibit with all the different aquatic animal and fish exhibits.  There are vary many exhibits and the interesting thing about them is the design of the tanks.  For example in one area, there were fish swimming in a kitchen sink.  Also, there is a tank where you can put your fingers in and the fish will nibble off your dead skin cells.  They didn't seem to interested that evening.  Overall, we enjoyed the time we spent here.", October 2016
128,4.0,Less than I'd expect from a city like Seoul,"This aquarium leaves a lot to be desired for a city of this size. In my opinion Busan is a much better aquarium. The majority of the exhibit is comprised of indigenous fresh water fish, however they do have a nice selection of sharks (one of which ate another shark in 2015 and can be seen on CNN online).", November 2016
129,4.0,Kids Enjoyed! ,"The aquarium was entertaining for the kids. Had a good selection of fish and animals from all over Korea as well as a select few from around the world. There is a section where they have fish in interesting tanks like vending machines, phone booths refrigerators, etc. that were pretty neat. Kids enjoyed the interactive touch exhibits and the sharks and rays.", December 2016
130,3.0,Good place for kids,"Just an aquarium with some national Korean touches. It's not the biggest one among the oceanariums I have visited, but it is obvious the object is very well maintained. The entrance fee is a little high for such a place. Good place for educational trips with kids.", November 2016
131,4.0,Worth to watch,"It's a mid range aquarium, not small not that much big, and full of families with kids. Specialy during weekends it's very busy and crowded, but koreans are very quiet and polite.You won't be regretful after spending one or two hours there.", May 2016
132,2.0,Good as a school trip.,"It's not that it's bad, but don't waste your time in Seoul on this attraction.  If you are travelling with children it will be a nice thing to do, but don't expect something special.", October 2016
133,5.0,Children's paradise,The aquarium presents a large and rare variety. The whole arrangement is with due consideration of children. The informative boards are in simple but catchy language to attract the kids. And really the kids enjoy it very much. It has a high educative value and is a 'must visit' place for children., November 2016
134,4.0,Great for family with kids,Their aquarium is pretty huge with huge sea animals too. Great for kids. And nice place to take picture., November 2016
135,3.0,Small and kinda smelly,We finished seeing everything in less than an hour. It's a very small aquarium and not really worth going to. You're better off just exploring Coex Mall itself., October 2016
136,1.0,Really?,You can't simply put random fish in random containers and call it an aquarium.I really wanted to like this place but this place is way too scattered and sparse in its exhibit to be a first class aquarium., October 2016
137,4.0,Way better than I thought!!!,"I found that it is one of the great aquarium (probably the best one) in Korea!! I didn't expect that much, just thought it would be normal one. But it was really nice and I did like it!! A lot kind of fishes and etc..... The best part was the glass tunnel there I felt like I was under the real sea!", October 2016
138,5.0,Amazing. ,I sow new and wearied kind of fish there. The most amazing view was the shark view. And they were playing music and they put cheers at the back so you can watch it comfortably as long as you want. رأيت هناك انواع غريبة و جديدة من السمك. المنظر الأكثر روعة كان لمنظر القروش من خلف الزجاج على طول اكثر من طابق., October 2016
139,4.0,Good enough,"Visited the Aquarium with a 3 year old and a 7 year old. The Aquarium isn't as grand and spectacular as some other Aquariums in Asia but considering it is right in the city and above a mall, it is not too bad. There are some fun exhibits for children. Some quite interactive, keeping young children busy. Visit for the entertainment aspect of it and yoi won't be disappointed. Expect to spend about 1.5 to 2 hours.", October 2016
140,3.0,Not quite the Aquariums found in Other Cities,"This Aquarium has some Limited Species of Fishes, it is Not that Attractive and a bit Pricey on the Entry Fee.It might Excite the Kids to see some Fishes, but not worth the Entry fee.", September 2016
141,2.0,"Not good value for money, average",I have been to plenty of aquariums over the world. The one in COEX mall was priced 15000 won back in 2012 and showed nothing much for the entrance fee. I found only the jelly fish section better than the rest. Entirely forgettable experience, November 2015
142,4.0,aquarium in a mall,I spent about 35 minutes total looking through the aquarium.  I think the price reflects the fact that the aquarium is in the middle of a city., February 2016
143,3.0,Correct aquarium,"Not as big and impressive as other aquariums in the world, you can spend some pleasant times to visit.", September 2016
144,4.0,Amazing!!,I recommend a visit to the aquarium expecially with kids of course. It is really amazing and there are also some exibitions during the feeding hours really nice( unfortunately only in korean but it is amazing the same). It is better to get information about the hours when you arrive., August 2016
145,5.0,Fun Aquarium ,"We were there in Aug. My 11  year old had a blast. You can touch certain fish/starfish and snails. Is not thay big but bigger than you would imagine since it is inside the mall. They have shows, and overall a good experience.", August 2016
146,4.0,Lovely place for kids and adults ,"My four year old and I love going to COEX aquarium. One can easily spend about 3-4 hours in the aquarium. It's not just viewing the lovely displays but also the shows like feeding the Sharks, penguin. You can touch and feel starfish which is fun. I love the display which has the fish that eats your dead skin. There is a innovative section where they have aquariums made with stuff like refrigerator, vending machine etc. definitely worth a trip.", August 2016

150,5.0,Great place and convenient within COEX mall,Family outing in COEX mall would never want to miss out the fun and educational aquarium. Note the feeding timetable for various locations if you like to witness the real time feeding fun., August 2016
151,5.0,my parents and daughter enjoyed the aquarium,"on a limited area, they successfully gave us a quick overview on Seoul/korean fishes. Then different sites are there for children to play and a lot of selfie posts for the adults who love it. A great way to organize an aquarium that i have not seen anywhere else, maybe only similar to Singapore. Dont be surprised, you will also see other animal types and not only fishes. Some are very cute that kept my daughter busy pointing out this and that, saying wow and oaah.Would recommend this for those travel to Seoul with kids.ps: prepare walking shoes as Coex Mall is huge and this aquarium is also quite big.", August 2016
152,3.0,"Not bad, pricy ","It is located inside the Coex mall but it is closer to the Bongeunsa station. The aquarium is definitely geared more towards kids. You can stick your hands in one of the tanks where they keep those small fish that munch on your dead skin. The aquarium is not that big, but they have penguins, otters, manatees, sea turtles, beavers, sharks and rabbits (???). It's a nice place to chill on a hot summer day.", August 2016
153,4.0,Bizarre at times,"This aquarium starts off like any other aquarium but then you get to the area of tanks that are shaped like a telephone box or fire extinguisher (same size a real one). The are also some rabbits, chipmunks, prairie dogs and Guinea pigs. It was quite crowded so it was difficult to see sometimes. There is a touch pool with some cool things like the sea pineapple and sea slug. There is only a small cafe which sells ice cream and a small selection of drinks inside the aquarium area, but a lot of good places around. Some quite pricey. You can get line number nine right to the door on the subway. Get off at Bongeusa station. This station wasn't on the map I picked up so I guess my map is old. As i didn't know about this station we caught line 7 to Cheongdam and walked down past the temple.", August 2016
154,5.0,Weekday adventure with Sammuel octopus ,"I've been here twice. I highly recommend avoiding weekends due to wall to wall crowds. Yesterday was a Wednesday and we had a great time. There weren't too many people there. We were able to do the moving tunnel twice. It's popular for a reason. It's a beautiful, creative, innovative aquarium with many artistic and shaped displays. There are lockers to place your backpacks and shopping bags. Inside, there's a snack shop with churros, ice cream, and coffee. There are stamp books for the kids ands touch pool with uniquely korean sea creatures like sea pineapples  in the touch pool. Line 9 takes you right to it. Near PF changs. Go in the mall and its to the right. Conan O Brian's pet octopus, Samuel) is in the crab display! ( he is an American TV star)", August 2016
155,5.0,Thoroughly enjoyable aquarium experience at the gigantic COEX Mall complex.,"We were very impressed with this attraction overall. Great care and planning, fun design elements and a variety of animals (including native species you'd be unlikely to encounter) made for an informative and entertaining experience. As a pair of adults (no kids) we'd recommend 1.5 - 2 hours for a leisurely encounter. With kids, perhaps adjust time expectations. This being Korea, great selfie opportunities abound and the tanks also lent themselves for some great pix and video to share w/ friends.  -- A tip for couples: we went late in the day on a weekday & that cut down on the kid-traffic, making the trip through a peaceful and soothing chance to unwind.", August 2016

I especially enjoyed how visitors could interact with some of the sea creatures (doctor fish, touching a starfish, etc.) and learn about some of the common illnesses in fish by looking under a microscope. The displays of the fish are also very creative; for example, one fish tank looked like a telephone box, and another looked like refrigerator.", June 2016

Not only fish, they have seals, manatees, penguins, otters, a croc, turtles and a lot more than I would expect. Though it's in a mall, the whole thing is quite big with a big tank and a glass tunnel.

174,3.0,Not Bad but Not Brilliant,"This is a ok aquarium but there are some things that let it down. Some of the tanks are a little small but this is due to the fact that it is in a mall. Despite this, it's still a nice way to spend the day. For Conan O'Brien fans, they have Samuel the Octopus on display toward the end of the aquarium. They also have an exhibit of more ""unusual"" fish tanks, with fish inhabiting such things as sinks, fridges and phone booths.This would be a good place to bring children. There's an ""aquarium passport"" that children can pick up and stamp along their way through the aquarium.All in all, a decent enough aquarium but certainly not the best one I've been to.", May 2016

We went early on a Sunday and it was not as packed as we feared it would be. Our little ones, 3.5 and almost 2, had a blast. The only thing we didn't care for where the touch exhibits. Those poor aquatic animals. But since our kids enjoyed it, we would certainly go back.", June 2016

180,5.0,Great aquarium at a conference center!,"We were pleasantly surprised by the quality and size of this aquarium.  Lots of great exhibits with a variety of species from around the world, as well as many tanks highlighting the fish of Korea.  Exhibits were cleverly displayed, most signs provided in both Korean and English.  On a weekday late morning, we had the place almost to ourselves with very few other visitors in sight.  This would be a great rainy day activity; as it was, it filled several hours before we had to leave for the airport at the nearby CALT center neighboring COEX.  Great family activity, although my husband and I enjoyed it even without kids.  It might be considered a bit pricey after the low cost entrance fees to the royal palaces and free entrance to the War Museum, but once inside we had no regrets over paying the $20-22 fee.  Well worth it!", May 2016

You must give accolades to them for their creativity.Ever imagined that your front load washing machine can be an aquarium? Or a bed lamp or a dressing table or a refrigerator or a public telephone booth for that matter? No? Well, then you will get to see them all and much more in Coex Aquarium.", January 2016

240,3.0,A nice Aquarium best suited for kids,I like to visit Aquariums when I travel and this is a nice one but it is really geared for small children., August 2015
241,5.0,Awesome,"Coex Aquarium is huge aquarium, and has a lot of different kinds of sea animals. Sharks are the main icon of the aquarium. The restaurant Deep Blue will offer great experience to you.", January 2015
242,4.0,Aquarium in the City,I thought it will just be another aquarium but it is nice! Aquarium in the city and they display many modernized aquarium setting.  Worth going for a different aquarium experience., December 2014
243,3.0, A good experience for children ,I saw so many school kids enjoying their visit but to me it was not the best choice. however I recorded some movies to show to my little daughter., August 2015
244,5.0,One of the best Aquariums,"This is one of the best aquariums I have been to. They had a very wide range of animals and the exhibits are very well maintained like everything else we had visited in Seoul. May seem a little pricey but very in line with what everything else in Seoul costs. Our boys - 4, 7, 11 - had a such a great time and couldn't stop talking about how much fun it was. The 11 year old said it was so much better than he expected! We stayed about 2 hours which was enough time to see all the exhibits and get out of the heat. It was a little busy but was assuming that it is end of summer trips for many.", August 2015
245,2.0,Good,I really advice you not to waste your time as you have alternatives. Yes it is a good place to visit but seoul is a full city with many thing better than this place, August 2015
246,5.0,Tops My List of Aquariums,"I think people are being a little too harsh on this place...In regards to what others have said, ""too expensive"" or ""not worth the price for the size"" and ""I've been to better.""My thoughts on these comments: ""too expensive"" and ""not worth the price for the size""It's 22,000 won for an adult (which is about $22). That's a few dollars cheaper than the other aquariums I've been to. So with that being said I don't think it was too expensive. I also have to say that it felt a lot bigger (maybe even double) the size of the aquariums I've been to (Aquarium by the Bay in San Francisco and Sea Life at the Mall of America.) So I have to say that it's worth the price for the size.""I've been to better""I have to say this tops my list for aquariums. It was mapped out perfectly and you flowed through the place. It was more than just fish but mammals as well. I doubt I'll ever go to another aquarium that has penguins, seals, sea otters, manatees, crocodiles, etc. all in one place. Other highlights for me: cool fish tank displays (working Coke machine, washing machine) and ""Dr. Fish.""", April 2015
247,4.0,Indoor fun!,The aquarium took about 2 hours. Kids enjoyed the unconventional tanks! We walked around Coex mall and then spent some time at the bookstore. It's a great place to spend on a rainy day in Seoul!, July 2015
248,5.0,Great aquarium,I especially loved the interactive displays and the glass tunnel. Many different types of sea creatures., June 2015
249,5.0,Highlight of my trip!,I love coex aquarium!  Located within a mall there was alot to do even after u left. The aquarium itself is separated into different sections and now includes a touch and see section and where you can actually touch the fishes (its actually more like the mussels and etc type stuff) as well as dip your hands for the doctor fishes (known to eat the dead skin off your hands/feet). Theres also a science laboratory section where you can see the growth stages of the sea creatures. Best thing is that they made it so that you can easily take photos without it reflecting light off your pictures. Whole thing should take a bit over an hr. Hope u enjoy!, July 2015
250,2.0,"Nothing special, but ok.","Quite a standard aquarium experience. In the middle there are some funny installations, such as ""phone booth aquarium"", or fishes swimming inside a laundry machine. A bit expensive compared to other major aquariums in Asia.", October 2014
251,4.0,"One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish —Look a Shark!","I really didn't want to go to the aquarium, but my husband insisted we look at the fish so  I went with him. The price about $20 usd was a bit steep I thought, but none-the-less we entered. Never have I been so pleasantly surprised! The place was well layed out, with arrows pointing the direction so you didn't collide with other observers and just enough light to see, but not so much that the place seemed artificial and gaudy. Not only does the aquarium house fish, but it also has turtles, rabbits, alligators, beavers, and prairie dogs. In some cases, I saw creatures in person that until then I had only seen on Animal Planet or the Discovery Channel. I must say, the Coex Aquarium is a wonderful attraction and a must see if you visit Seoul.", May 2015
252,5.0,Great aquarium,"We had such a good day at the aquarium.  This is such an unexpectedly good attraction in the COEX mall.  It is one of the largest aquaria we have ever been to.  There are all sorts of animals that live in the water here (not just fish) such as beavers, alligators, penguins, otters and huge turtles.  The entrance price is quite high but, I think, entirely worth it.  We did get a discount as we had bought something at one of the stores in the mall.  We spent around 2 1/2 hrs here.  If you time it right, try and see some of the feeding times.  Penguins at 15.30. We found the keepers very respectful of the animals too as they were observing a penguin", June 2015
253,2.0,Disappointing,"We have been to many aquariums, this one was nothing special in our opinion. The cost to get in is not worth it. For the price, it needs to be 2-3 times larger. Our pre-teens were bored. We spent maybe 2 hours here. And that was us TRYING to take our time and read everything to get our moneys worth.", July 2014
254,4.0,Good time,Good to see some very cute looking fish tanks. Not an enormous aquarium but big enough for me to walk around and relax looking at the fishes swim., April 2015
255,4.0,"Once in Seoul with the Kiddos, great place to check  it out.",Not cheap but worth the price. Had a blast with a family of friends. We went  on Tuesday and we got  lucky because it wasn't crowded and we could appreciate the all the cool  upgrades😊., June 2015
256,4.0,A nice day trip,"A great place to visit if you're staying in the area, for sure.  Nearby the buffet (which has wine!).  Also, ask for the foreigner discount if you're not Korean to save a bit of money on admission.", July 2014
257,4.0,Fun Aquarium in the Coex Mall area,"My family stayed at the Intercontinental Coex and walked along the corridors to the subway often. We passed the Coex Aquarium frequently and made a point to visit before our trip to Seoul was complete.This is a pretty big aquarium. I think it's bigger than the 63 Sea World, we liked it even better than 63 Sea World. There were lots of fish, sharks, rays, seals, jelly fish, penguins, and a touch pool area. There was an area geared towards kids but it was a little bit run down when we visited and not all the exhibits worked. We were a little disappointed, but aside from that everything was well maintained and the homes of the creatures looked clean and cared for. There were many many tanks to see animals in. They boast 3,000 tons of water with 650 species, and 40,000 living things.The place is open 10am to 8pm every day of the year. Even when they are closed they have a couple beautiful tanks outside filled with color fish to entice you to return when they are open.They have an overpriced cafe and a souvenir shop. They are a little on the expensive side at about $19 for adults, and $14 for kids. We saw the entire place in about an hour. Our favorite parts included the Japanese garden type area with a huge koi pond, the photo op type things you stick your head through, that they had a chipmunk at an aquarium, the seahorses, the penguins, and the jellyfish.", July 2014
258,5.0,One of the best!,"I visited the COEX Aquarium today and I really enjoyed it. The themes are good, with ample species of fish and wildlife. It is the first time I saw penguins and beavers in captivity. It was also the first time I saw a living corral.  The show was also good, and it did not involve petting animals.Overall a good two hours well spent.", May 2015
259,5.0,very good aquarium,"Lots of information about the fish Lots of fish!  Watched the snapping turtles feed, that was great The Manatees were the cutest I liked the Korea section - fish in Korea I completed the little treasure hunt thing and got all the stamps I think some of the displays were a little strange but creative (fish inside washing machine, fish inside refrigerator, fish inside telephone box etc) I didn't feel that there was enough effort in raising awareness about ocean conservation, but of course there was some at least Ocean conservation education is pretty important to me so I felt that could have been betterYou can touch the starfish And I saw the two huge tortoises mating There were jellyfish (which they didn't have in Seaworld, Yoiudo) And a huge octopus which was sleeping It took a while to get around It took the whole day actually (one hour from where i stay plus lunch and then going home again) I liked how it takes you through all the different waters of the world so you always know which ""region"" you are in when you see the fish Some of the creatures were really massive And they all look healthy and the staff were affectionate towards the animals so... good place :)", May 2015
260,4.0,Very cool!,"I was under the impression this place was going to be a really cruel place with no room for the animals to move but I was pleasantly surprised. The rabbits (yes they have rabbits) had heaps of room! Most fish tanks were relatively full for the smaller fish but nothing horrendous! The tanks for the larger animals such as sharks, stingray, manatee etc were huge and they had heaps of room! The only cage that I didn't like was for the monkey :( he needed more room. Otherwise the place in general was very exciting and fun - even for older people! The 'doctor' fish that eat dead skin cells off your hands and the Sharks were definitely my highlight! In my opinion overall worth the money and recommend!", May 2015
261,4.0,Worth A Visit,"We thought the COEX Aquarium looked modern and was imaginatively laid out.  To us, it was better than most, not as good as some others.  It had enough of interest to keep us occupied for a little over an hour.  It is located in a large shopping centre.", April 2015
262,4.0,A Better Aquarium Than I expected!,"This is a pretty good aquarium, better than I thought it would be. It is a great place for small children with many features provided for their benefit, like an acquatic petting zoo! There is a tube shaped aquarium with a beautiful array of sharks and rays and other species. There is enough English signage for non-Koreans. Bathrooms are easily reachable.", May 2015
263,4.0,Started out so lame but ended up great! Excellent place to unwind after a conference.,"Went here on thursday afternoon and not many people around. I was disappointed at the start because the first half of the aquarium all you see was small tanks with random species of freshwater fish, saltwater fish and other animals that are not exactly water bound. I understand otter, frogs, waterbugs, turtles and saltwater crocodiles being there but squirrels, rabbits and bats?Anyhow, the exhibits for the smaller animals needed upgrading. I have seen children aquarium better than those. I mean, plastic seaweed, people? Really? But luckily things got better from there. The bigger tanks had giant manatees, and some other rare species. Jellyfish aquarium was so much fun. Saltwater aquariums grouped by region (hawaii tank, pacific tank, great barrier reef and so on) were fabulous. The shark tank and the silvery school of fish in the main tank took my breath away. Too bad most of animal information was written in korean, only the names were written in english. Adults will probably spend 1 hour here walking leisurely but if you are travelling with kids be prepared to spend around 2 hours or more.", April 2015
264,1.0,Cruel,50 fish to one small tank. The place is busy and the fish are in tiny tanks. I love Korea but I don't like the zoos etc over there., May 2014
265,1.0,Cruel display environments.,"My friends and I were visiting Seoul for just 2 days. we decided to take a city tour that included the Codex Aquarium. My friends enjoy diving and marine anything.  The building that houses the Aquarium is a marvel. There are shops and restaurants and meeting places for large events. A huge facility. The entry to the exhibit space is colorful and welcoming.  And then it happens. You see large tanks of huge fish, so full of fish that it looks like one of those choose your own fish for supper places. Sadly, it gets worse, because they also have marine mammals, otters etc. and they have no room to swim, little tiny bits of water in the very front of the case, no privacy areas. They have Bats, where they cannot fly. They have Manatees just in a tank, no environment and with 3 beasts no room to really move and nowhere to move to. Really really sad. The whole thing is just heart breaking.  Kids who don't know any better will love it. But their parents who should know better should not take them there and support this cruel treatment.", March 2015
266,4.0,Better than Expected,"I thought an aquarium inside a mall would be an over-sized pet store with some fish. In reality this aquarium is large, and has a lot of exhibits. Marine mammals, birds, a wide array of fish. The displays are good. Entry price is about $20.", April 2015
267,4.0,There is no such thing as a fish...,"That title is actually true, seriously check it out.Anyway... this place has everything from penguins to dolphins, fantastic shows and feed (i recommend getting there earlier so you can follow the feeding and enjoy the shows. so much to see that you certainly won't be bored. everything from the colourful to the fantastic.", May 2014

271,4.0,"Well-done, memorable displays of aquatics","Yes, it is an aquarium in a shopping mall, but surprisingly well done:  clean, well-organized, well-labeled (sufficient English signage and labels), well-lit.  The animals all appear to be well-cared-for and displayed in suitable educational settings.   That said, there are also humorous and creative goldfish tanks in washing machines and other unexpected setups.  I would call this a must-see stop for kids and aquarium aficionados.  We saw the sardine-dancing show, which was clearly for the kids -- scuba divers in royal robes -- but still entertaining.  We went on a holiday, so it was really crowded, though still manageable.  It is not cheap, but not outrageous, for 3 good hours of educational entertainment.  If you live in the area, buy an annual pass, to bypass the ticket queue.  I mean, you can go shopping, go to a movie, and drop by the shark tank.  What more could you ask for?", February 2015
272,4.0,A wide variety of fish,"For an aquarium in a mall, it had an impressive variety of fish.  Many small tropical to even large shark tank.  Location was very convenient with large number of restaurants in mall.  Easy access to subway", February 2015

274,4.0,interesting,My kids both 12 and 10 years old both loved this Coex Aquarium!! they had seen here several sea animals that they have never seen before.. Very educational and very clean. I especially love how they design the aquarium of the sea animals!!! very creative!!! Love this aquarium!!!, December 2014
275,4.0,This is not Sea World,"This is not Sea World, but it is the nicest aquarium in Seoul - plenty of interesting exhibits, and it can get a little crowded at times in some of the narrower spaces.  Very interesting fish exhibits from around the world, with some mammals (penguins, manatees, otters, etc) and amphibians mixed in.  Plan to time your visit around some of the live feeding shows - the staff put on an entertaining underwater show in their wet suits and costumes.  The aquarium is located on the lower level of the mall, so there are plenty of dining options right nearby.  Best to go during the week when things are a bit less crowded - the entry fee was not exorbitant, about $20 US for adults, a bit less for teens and younger children.  You can easily spend 3 hours strolling and viewing the exhibits.", December 2014
276,4.0,Great indoor aquarium - COEX,"The COEX Aquarium in Gangnam district, Seoul, is one of South Korea's largest Aquariums with over 40,000 creatures from over 650 species on display. The COEX Aquarium features 90 exhibition tanks grouped in fourteen ""discovery zones"", including six themed areas. The aquarium is housed within the COEX mall.  I particularly loved Wonderland - the home of unusual fish tanks in the form of toilet bowls, telephone booth (yes, the big red telephone booth and imagine it with fish inside)...Wonderland brings together a crazy collection of eccentric fish tanks. The shower-cubicle tank is home to a yellow-bearded dragon fish, and there is a seahorse living in a computer monitor. Put your hand in the bathtub and you will be tickled by doctor fish, from the river basins of Turkey.The Seven Seas features a kaleidoscope of tropical fish while Ocean Kingdom is home to dozens of sharks, rays and huge schools of fish, creating a real sense of life in the deep seas.  We stayed for quite a while in Ocean Kingdown admiring the sharks :)", December 2014
277,4.0,A lot of hands on for all as you can feel some creatures.  It's quite worth a visit if you have some time.,"Coex Aquarium is inside Coex Mall.  Coex Mall is connected to the subway & easily accessible.  However, this mall is a high end mall & we did not really shop there.", December 2014
278,4.0,"Fun, creative exhibits, but crowded.","We went here last weekend with a 14 year only and a four year old. If you have little ones, don't go on the weekend unless you want to carry them the whole time so they can see. It was extreamly crowded and backpacks and purses were knocking my little guy constantly. There is free stroller parking and lockers for 1000-2000 won. It cost around  70000 won for our family. We enjoyed it. The sea lions and manatees were great, especially at feeding time. There was a diver and fish show that was cool too. They have an exhibit area that had a variety of artistic shapes aquariums.  The pufferfish, shark, and seahorses were great. There was an electric eel display and plenty on cool river fish. Many of the fish names were labeled in English, but the descriptions were all in Hungul. Overall, a fun way to spend a few hours. I would go back on a weekday. Tip: bring your lic. Plate number and type it into the kiosk at the entrance for discounted parking. There are English signs in the parking garage for the aquarium. The CoEx mall also has lots of food choices, a theater, and a giant 2 story slide.", December 2014

280,4.0,"Awesome, not Perfect","I really enjoyed the Coex aquarium. Visitors are directed through the museum along a prescribed path, with each room or area promoting some different theme. There were fish that I had never seen before and some especially interesting creatures (the manatee exhibit was very cool). There were a few displays/pens that I found a bit disturbing due to the size. I found the monkey, beaver and crocodile exhibits to be far too small. On the whole however, I though it was great and would definitely recommend it.", November 2014
281,4.0,Bigger than it looks from the outside!,"When you see the Aquarium from inside COEX Mall, it's deceiving. It seems like it would be a very small aquarium. But once you're inside, it keeps going and going with pleasant surprises. I especially liked seeing the sharks through the clear glass tunnel. I also enjoyed seeing the penguins jump in and out of the water. There are two downsides to this aquarium. It's very crowded on Saturday afternoons which should come as no surprise. You'll be bombarded with kids and some parents that might bump into you with their strollers. Also, the prices are a bit steep (22,000 won for adults, 19,000 for middle/high school students, and 16,500 for senior citizens). But if you're patient, you'll be able to enjoy a nice experience.", July 2014
282,3.0,Basic aquarium,"The aquarium was well maintained. I went during the day on Thursday so there were not many other people visiting but several preschool classes. Children will enjoy this most but adults can still appreciate all the different species of fish and amazing colors of saltwater fish! I have been to other aquariums so this did not excite me a whole lot but my mother had never seen anything like this and was amazed! One interesting aspect was the ""tunnel"" that you can walk through, it is as if   you are in Biblical times when the Red Sea was parted. That was the most interesting part and best viewing area.", October 2014
283,5.0,Nice afternoon visiting the Coex aquarium!,"Maybe this is not the best aquarium in the world, but my 10yo and I spent a nice afternoon visiting this aquarium. Despite the fact that most explanations are in Korean, the visit is very pleasant, relaxing, interesting.  The shows are great, the undersea tunnel is amazing...and we especially loved the fish doctors: you put your fingers in a small aquarium, and the little fishes come and clean the dead skin on them. Very funny!  And like in North america, you exit the aquarium by the gift shop...very smart! Easy to please your child with not so many Won.", November 2014

It is really nice.I went with my girlfriend on a weekend, and it was crowded, but the flow was good.  It is underground, so it is really cool and well ventilated, and I never felt like I was in a big crowd. Everyone moved around and through the line really well, and everyone was happy, especially the kids.  With so much to see, it is laid out and designed very well. Along with the most beautiful sea creatures that you will ever see, there are extras like other animals and reptiles. Lots of fun with  a Disney like flair with little props and stages for the kids.There are drink machines all along the ""caves"" inside, so you will not go thirsty, and plenty of staff around to help at any time.
