2,2.0,Small and basic,We didn't plan on going here but we're walking around downtown and came across it so we tried it out. The gaming floor is not very large.

4,1.0,Terrible casino and staff,"Worst casino and staff I have ever been to. Interesting that everyone at the front desk not only cant speak a word of english, but dont even try to explain things to you. I was given false information that caused alot of inconvenience for me.", March 2018
5,1.0,One of the worst casino’s ever.,"It’s the middle of winter and it’s like a sauna inside.  Very small, atmosphere is very tedious, and yes foreigners only.

6,1.0,Worst place ever!,"The people there were so incredibly rude, and they do NOT offer free food and drink!  That is a flat out lie.

9,2.0,A very small casino,Location is not convenience and the casino itself is very small and not new at all. If you live in the hotel right next to it then it's not a bad idea to have a bet over there. My kid was left outside in the game room and wait us., December 2016
10,2.0,Advice from an American Gambler,"As an avid world gamer from California, I would skip this casino if you are looking for anything that resembles Las Vegas or Macau.

15,1.0,"Cold, dull, boring and poor service","I have been to many casinos around the world and this easily stands out as the worst one by a mile.

16,3.0,Bring your Passport - Gangnam Gambling,"Was walking around Coex shopping center and came across this casino. I am from Las Vegas, so I just wanted to check things out to see how it compares.

21,1.0,poor service,Manager song yong bum and staff hong snae was exceptionally rude to hotel guests at Oakwood Premier.  Will never stay at Oakwood premier again and do not recommend spending $$ at the seven luck casino.  Was denied entrance to casino because staff took it upon themselves to deny, March 2014
22,1.0,Their best is still not good enoug,The  staff cant even manage a fake smile to a guest. Very monotonous  tone (even if you excuse their English skills).

24,1.0,First casino experience-was awful,Never been to a casino before-so decided to have a look.

25,3.0,Not as good the other branch,"After I have been to other branch in Seoul,  the Gangnam seems to be too dark inside. I also agree that the location is not easy to find. However I still like the slow going casino feel, this is good for small punter like me.", October 2012
26,1.0,Horrible Casino,"This place was awful from start to finish. It was extremely hard to find, and no one working at the stores in the vicinty seemed to know where it was.

27,1.0,Stay avay of Black Jack tables - rip off,"In addition to previous comments about being dark and fun-less we've experinsed the real fraud. They use spesial dealing machines for Black Jack - you don't see card deck there like in LV. Instead they are all inside the machine and are shaffled there too, and the machine", September 2012
28,1.0,"Smoky,run down and campy, avoid it!",This has seen better days. I do not recommend this unless you are really desperate to lose money in a smoky run down campy casino that would be closed in hours on the Vegas strip., May 2012
