0,5.0,Good experience,"Clean air due to non smoking environment, smokers can smoke in smoking room within casino. This is a mini casino, thus it is quite quiet making gambling here is pretty pleasant. Free food provided for visitor who gamble here. Workers here are mostly polite. Nice place to visit", October 2019
1,4.0,No more smoking smell,"I read some reviews about the smoking smell inside this casino, but when I was there, no smoke is allowed inside the room. There is a small cabinet for smoker and now the remain room is fresh.For your information.", October 2019
2,1.0,Indoor air quality is worst! and rudest players all over.,"1. You need a mask to protect yourself. Indoor air quality is worst. There is a smoking room but smoke smell is all over the casino. I stayed for 4 hours one day but I had suffered to breathing and I lost my voice.2. I met rudest players there. They put their membership cards at their favorite slot machine and they were blocking other players to access while they are even not playing for hours! and the casino doing nothing to these rude players let them keep doing this.카지노에서 신경 좀 쓰셔야죠! 플레이 중 싸인을 걸어 둔다거나 맴버쉽 카드를 머신에 끼워 놓고 1 시간 이상씩 게임 하지 않고 남도 못하게 하는 그런 사람들을 어떻게 관리를 않하시나요?3. I saw one player spit out on the floor so disgusting! 4. Lots slot machines are broken and and old.5.The employees are not very kind.6.The slot machines are so close each other so when it is crowed, the rude players without saying ""excuse' or ""sorry"" just rudely passed by me.7.The casino needs more aware to watch their guests. Most players are Chinese Korean, Chines and some Japanese and other Asians..... YOU'LL KNOW WHO THEY ARE!!!", June 2019
3,3.0,Good Experiance,"Went in the evening. It's fully occupied with foreigners and few Koreans. Managers are just ok and not great with English, Easy to make a gamble and cashout. Food is only available with card points that's a minus.", June 2019
4,4.0,5star Hotel,Friendly staff to help u chk in and in lobby area. Free shuttle to Seoul Train Stn n Itewon shopping. Free WiFi average quality. 7star Casino in the basement. Afew restaurants oppt the hotel if u wish to go out for meals., May 2019
5,1.0,Horrible experience!!!,It’s the place that sucks all foreigners money.... Restaurant inside casino is only accepting casino membership card’s point. If you didn’t have enough point you can not order food even with your own cash!!?? Even you are a hungry customer you have spent enough money so you can order food inside....FYI, December 2018
6,1.0,Horrible customer service,"Customer service who works at reception desk was very unprofessional to say the least. When I showed US passport card, they denied my entry but couldn't explain why. Later, the lady said she couldn't read Alphabet - did not know what was written in the card who clearly recognized the same alphabet in the passport later. She lied again claiming that she was an immigration officer who can deny the entry based on her own judgement. While the validity of US passport card for a casino entry remain to be debated, her attitude and response was not professional nor pleasant. Will not visit there again, never.", April 2017
7,1.0,Not Really English Speaking Friendly,"All the other reviews sum up the basic idea of this place, small, cramped, and not very fun when compared to a place like Vegas.  I sat down at a slot machine and I there was no one around.  I stupidly put in my voucher of 23,000 won into the machine and looked up to see that someone else had left a Players Card in the machine.  Before I knew it the owner returned and started slapping my hand as I tried to hit the help button.  A manager came over and I explained the situation, but the final result was sorry...there is nothing we can do.  So the guy basically assaulted me and got to gamble with my money with no compensation from the casino.  This place is a money pit.", March 2017
8,1.0,Only worth it if you are staying in the Hilton,"This was the smallest casino I have ever stepped foot into. There are no craps tables and as you would expect it is mostly baccarat. I stayed at roulette for a few minutes and I wish I was exaggerating, but it was 5-7 minutes between spins.", March 2017
9,2.0,Small Casino and Packed,"Small casino, probably the size of 2 hotel ballrooms. Smoking is now only allowed in 2 tiny rooms at the opposite ends of casino. Under 10 blackjack tables, probably 20 baccarat tables, a few roulette tables, slots. Machine roulette and baccarat available. Spotted 2 three card poker. But that's about it. Since this is foreigners only, there's quite a mix of people. Dealers can understand hand signals for blackjack and basic English. Be wary of Chinese middle aged women tourists, they tend to nag at YOUR blackjack game. Great for a quick gambling fix, but probably a one off visit.", January 2017
10,4.0,Ok place if gambling is your thing,"This is not a make a casino what you would expect anywhere in Los Vegas. This was basically the size of a high school gymnasium,  but it did have all of the essentials.  And although my little walk around only lasted two or three minutes they did have complementary iced coffee water and plum tea. No pictures for this post because they don't allow photography inside and be sure to remember your passport just walk in the front door.", September 2016
11,1.0,Not what would you expect....,"This is an Asian style casino.... Meaning no glamour, dirty, crammed full of rowdy male gamblers (mostly tourists groups flown in from China) who are pushy, loud and love to spit into cups. Filthy place !!!!!!", May 2016
12,4.0,Great place to gamble ,"Needs more tables, was standing for a seat to play averaging about 45min  -1.5 hr. The beer or alcohol beverage coming around the casino is delivered by one,yes one, person. This is crazy, if you are on the later end of the rotation the beer is warm and flat. Not the way I want my beer. I ended up going to the bar myself to get a cold one.", April 2016
13,2.0,Managing Director ,Only for foreigners but everyone speaking only in Korean. Poor quality slots. I never saw any  winner of jackpot. I stayed there 8 nights., March 2016
14,2.0,Interesting,"I like casinos. I like visiting different casinos. This casino is small, crowded (hard to get a seat at a blackjack table) and not service oriented. I was betting a significant amount (10x minimum) and was told the beer cart would be around once an hour. Just to get a ten ounce paper cup of beer. Interesting. I joined the club, and hope that over time, as I play recreationally, service will get better.", January 2016
15,2.0,"Small, not enough poker tables",Very small casino and very crowded on the weekends.  There are not a lot of poker dealers so you have to wait hours to play.  The automatic order machines for food were both out of order so you cant order food at the time because you cant order directly to the waitresses.  Managers are unable to speak other languages but yet no Koreans are allowed it is for foreigners only so why not speak other languages?  Not a good casino don't waste your time or your money., January 2016
16,2.0,staff not adequately trained in customer service,"The SL casino is centrally located and very easy to get to.  Bit small and not much choice of tables.  Slot machines are joke, but if you want to gamble for few hours and have some fun with your buddies, this is it!  I have to say, the casino staffs looks so bored and unfriendly.  I find that the worst thing about these dealers is that they make stupid comments to each other about the players and criticize how these low life players are.  I'm Korean but I find that these low level staffs are not adequately trained have no idea about good customer service. They should smile more and treat players better.", November 2015
17,2.0,Small Casino,It's a small casino.  Not much choices in machines.  Some table games are available.The service staffs at the entrance of the Casino are less than friendly in attending to players.I guess you will not miss much to omit this place though it is known to be one of the bigger casino within Seoul.Smoking rooms are disgusting.  Smokers are spitting into ash trays and some were noted to have done the spitting on the floor.  Not an uncommon sight in Korea though., November 2015
18,5.0,This is a lovely hotel in a fabulous location.,"Mr. Hong who manages the hotel should be commended.  This hotel is awesome.  The food choices are great, the service wonderful and it's location can not be beat.", October 2015
19,1.0,Don't expect to make any noise...,"I was very disappointed with the attitude of the managers and treatment I received.  As an establishment that caters to foreigners, they didn't appreciate any conversation with your fellow table mates or high fives when decent cards were dealt.  I've been to many casinos throughout the States and Europe and this was the first I was scolded for try have a good time or made to feel belittle.  I noticed the talkative men were not treated the same.  Really sad Black Jack player :-(", August 2015
20,2.0,Don't Bother If You're Looking for Gambling Action,"I only know of this place because I stayed at the Hilton next door.  My mother (who is a big gambler) was initially excited but quickly became disappointed upon entering.  First of all, the place is pretty small.  I believe there might be less than a 50 slot machines in total.  Second, the machines are all pretty old and according to my mom, they weren't very fun or interesting. I'd say if you're looking for gambling action in Asia, head to Macau.", February 2015
21,3.0,Not a big casino,"Get a 30000 won voucher from the Korean Tourist Promotion website http://english.visitkorea.or.kr . Very convenient if you stay at Millenium Seoul Hilton because it's located at the basement.  Well, it's a casino , what to expect? Table card games and slot machines, counter serving drinks. What else?", October 2014
22,3.0,Just an ok casino but nice that it's attached to the hotel,"This casino was quite busy and I don't think they were all folks staying in the hotel. Although they say no locals, there seemed to be a lot of people there so they must have all been visiting, mostly from China. The casino is quite small with about 2-3 dozen tables and the same number of slots. The minimum bid is actually quite high compared to what you can get in Macau or Vegas. For a fun place to lose a bit of money and have some fun, it was a nice getaway but it is quite small and not that much variety.", May 2014
23,2.0,Too small,"Very different as far as casinos go.  The Hilton hotel itself is nice, but the casino is not.  You have to have your passport checked before you are allowed in the casino.  The casino is small, and there are not many slot games at all.  No one is smiling; overall depressing feeling.  I was happy to leave after just an hour.", September 2013
24,2.0,"Small, Old, and Depressing","This place looks great on the outside and as you walk in the entrance to have your passport checked.  Then, you enter the actual casino room.  It's so dirty and old feeling.  There really is no excitement in there or fun energy.  It's just a bunch of old people sitting around smoking.  There aren't free (alcoholic) drinks, although there is a long line to get your free coffee/tea.  Since Korean citizens aren't supposed to be legally allowed to play at this casino, I didn't expect there to be only Koreans there, but it seemed like we were the only foreigners who didn't speak Korean in the whole place.  The tables are run in Korean language, ironically, since Korean citizens are not supposed to be allowed.  I understand that we're in Korea and some people with Korean background but of different nationality will be there, but for a place that is supposed to cater to foreigners I expected that the dealers would at least be able to speak a language other than Korean.  Not the case.  None of them seemed happy to be there, and I felt like they just wanted us to leave.  Really not a welcoming atmosphere.  We left in horrible moods and completely disappointed.  This is only getting 2 instead of 1 because of the pretty entrance and exterior.", July 2013
25,2.0,bad service,very rude staff and attitude was bad ... not professional like the other casinos overseasneeds more smiles and customer service to be able to compete with the world standard casinos, February 2013
26,3.0,Very Small casino,I visited this casino in 2008. Im not sure if they've upgraded it since then but if was very small. Probably as big as a banquet hall. They had great choices but I expected a little more., February 2012
27,4.0,Casino fun slowly arrived,"Well, I like this casino because the lighting is quite bright for casino setting. Being no local is better in a way, I always at least find a place to bet.Smoking is fine since I am a social smoker myself. My wife did complain.Roulette was set that you can bet in both sides on one roulette. The speed is slow moving. I can say that it is at least three time slower per spin.I like this too. At least I can think of my lucky number.Nobody force you to tip.By the sound of my tune, of course I won.", October 2012
28,3.0,Not an attraction in itself,"Being located right inside a hotel frequented by tour groups and business travellers alike, this casino is always buzzing with activity. There game selection is typical for Korea and Asia in general, with baccarat, roulette, etc. being very popular and blackjack being more of a side attraction. The atmosphere is a far cry from the craziness that is Las Vegas or even Macau. It's a very confusing, foreign environment for anyone who's never been to a Korean casino before. One positive is that food/drink is free and the restaurant serves pretty good food. However, they only serve water with food in the restaurant and other drinks need to be ordered at the tables.I was staying at the Hilton so I came here a few times to kill some time and have a quick bite to eat but Korean casinos are really nothing to get excited about.", April 2012
29,2.0,Great (FREE) food but Poor Ambiance & Health Hazard,"Firstly, bring your foreign passport and get a free casino members cardSecondly, the above card entitles you to 2 free meals at the casino restaurant.  Excellent quality lunch type food (rice bowls/noodle soups with seafood/beef).  This free food was better then what I ate in normal restaurantsThirdly, quench your thirst with unlimited coffee, tea, juice)Fourthly, wear a gas mask: the casino is filled with Chinese tourists who smoke non-stop", January 2012
