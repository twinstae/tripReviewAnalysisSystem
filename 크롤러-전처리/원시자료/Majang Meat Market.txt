6,5.0,Good quality beef at affordable prices,"It was an interesting experience, buying fresh beef from the butchers on ground floor and having them take us to a BBQ place upstairs to grill the meat. It seemed pretty daunting at first.. as we wondered which cuts to get and whether we would get ripped off. However, everything fell into place. The butchers were very friendly and they recommended a beef set with a variety of cuts, all of which tasted so good (particularly the flat iron steak). We ended up having one of the best meals of our trip and will definitely go back again.", May 2019

14,5.0,"1++ Grade Korean Beef, at a much lower price","This place was recommended by some folks from Hong Kong as a great way to get top quality beef at a low cost.  Find a vendor (preferably one who sells the top grade of beef), choose what cuts you want, have them slice it, then take it upstairs to do Korean BBQ on their grills.  The beef was awesome.  They do supply some side dishes with the Korean BBQ.  Getting there was pretty easy.  Take the #5 line to Majang (station 541), walk straight, take the first left.  Then walk past the elementary school several blocks, and follow your nose to the indoor market on the right.  Wash the beef down with some good Korean soju.", February 2018
