0,4.0,360 degrees,"My family and I prepaid for our tickets to visit. We went early in the morning so it wasn’t so busy. It was a very interesting experience - from the interactive movie to the glass floor there is plenty to see. When we visited, the outside deck was closed without advising why.  ", February 2020
1,5.0,New place to visit in Seoul,"V. new place to see all Seoul with 123++ fl. of sky tower , you can see all Seoul in your eyes , feeling like visit Perl tower in shanghai", January 2020
2,5.0,"Great Experience, Potentially Fantastic Views","Unfortunately the day we went up the tower it was very cloudy, but that didn't affect our experience. The setup they have is very cool, and the double decker elevator was very interesting. Glass floor and open air areas were both fascinating. Prices for souvenirs weren't that bad either. Views must be great, but we just couldn't see that far. On a clear day, I 100% recommend going up the tower.", December 2019
3,5.0,New go to observation deck in Seoul,We skipped the N tower and come to Seoul Sky for the experience.It’s very convenient as it’s outside of the metro station. Maybe due to the cost there is not a long line. Go during sunset to see sunset and night view of the buzzling city, January 2020
4,3.0,Seoul Sky Tower,I thought the ride up would be unnerving. But it wasn't. I didn't feel anything in the lift from ground floor going up to 120th floor. And it only took 1 minute. Definitely state of the art technology., December 2019
5,5.0,THIS PLACE IS BEYOND AMAZING!,"Getting here was not easy. Again, Waze failed to get us there accurately. It took us about an hour to get there when in fact, it should have been only 20 mins.Our tickets were purchased online and queueing was so long! You'd think after you get in at the entrance you will find the elevator, but no. It is a long line and a long wait to get to the elevator. We went there on a Saturday, so it is predicted that there will be too many people. Once we got our turn to get in the elevator, the speed was amazingly quick. I had my left eardrums popping but it was expected. We got to the 117th floor first.... it was already awesome.  The glass floors were cool! The sight was beautiful outside because all we could admire were the lights from buildings and vehicles. Getting to the top floor, the 123rd floor, was wonderful! That's where my fiance and I had dinner - with candlelight. It's very romantic in that place. Food was overwhelmingly delicious and expensive.", December 2019
6,4.0,The air condition is the most important,"Visitors can go from 117F to 123F. Pick a day with a nice visibility if you don't wish to visit again.- There are various discount rules like 30% off for Lotte Card Holders or seniors.- It is pretty well-maintained. Accesses from/to the elevators looked very impressive. Elevators were very fast. Enough things to see. Enough places to rest. - Photo studios are free. But, can't receive photos without paying. Better to pass unless you purchase.- 123F is a luxurious dessert café. It looked like a membership lounge. But, it wasn't. Most people seemed go up just until 122F.- Liked glass floors the most. Restrooms were amazing, too.- There were three open-air terraces and only one of them was allowed to access. I think you can earn the best photo here when someone else takes photos from upper floor.", December 2019
7,4.0,Breathtaking views of Seoul!,"The tallest building in South Korea and the 6th tallest building in the world (taller than our local KLCC), is recommended to visit for breathtaking 360-degree views of Seoul city. Somehow they don't allow baby strollers citing it might interfere with visitor experience, so we had to leave them at the tower lobby. The entrance is located inside Lotte World. Tickets for adults (13 years and older) are at KRW 25,500 and child tickets (36 months to 12 yrs old) are at KRW 22,500.If you're not afraid of heights, check out glass floor viewing platform.", August 2019
8,5.0,Amazing Architecture,"The Lotte Tower is easily accessible from Jamsil station on the excellent Seoul subway system. The tower shopping mall is huge and includes a fantastic aquarium, but we were there to visit the tower observatory. We only had a minutes wait for the very fast elevator which delivers you to a small theatre where you are shown a brief animated film, then suddenly the screen moves out of the way to reveal the awesome view from the 117th floor. You can then move through the 4 floors of the observatory where there are the obligatory gift shop and cafes.There is an open terrace and a glass floored observation deck to test your nerves. While we were on the glass deck , and congratulating ourselves for being brave, a maintenance crew appeared on the outside of the deck in a  work bucket!The 360 degree views over the river and the huge city of Seoul are brilliant.", October 2019
9,3.0,Beautiful but dirty windows. ,"Spots visible on every picture taken in daytime. And at night, curved thick windows reflect to much light. Not as exciting as it was 2 years back when views were breathtaking.", December 2019
10,4.0,High places to visit,"If you like the tall buildings, you need to check this off your bucket list.Foreigners can get a discounted ticket on line, keep that in mind.  The day I went there was no major cue, maybe 8 minutes so it was perfect.  The views are great, and to stand on the glass observation deck is cool.", November 2019
11,1.0,Worst experience in seoul,"Very long queue going UP. Staffs keep on explaining in Korean, not even speaking in English. When we arrived on the observation deck we saw very long queues heading towards the elevator going down. Definitely not worth it. Waited for about 3 hours in total.", November 2019
12,5.0,Loved it,"You can't travel to Seoul without visiting Seoul Sky, and getting a spectacular view of the city.  The observation floors allow one to see Seoul that is only possible at that elevation.  The observation floors are from 117-123rd floors.  The highest floor is a bar and restaurant.   The ticket to Seoul Sky allows access to all the floors.   No matter what floor you are on, you'll enjoy a great view of the Korean capital.", October 2019
13,5.0,Fantastic observatory experience,"At the end of the day, an observatory is an observatory - you go up, it's really high, you get a great view of the city at sunset or lit up all around you. Seoul Sky, however, does go above and beyond that, and that's why it's more impressive. The actual observatory section consists of ~4 floors, each section has something different to offer. The view, obviously, but also the food/cafe/bar options on each are different, photo options are different, and open-air sky terrace is on one level, a shop is on one of the level, and so are the glass paneled floors. THAT is the real star of the observatory - they actual have two sections with glass floors, both are fairly large in size, and are well maintained so you can easily look straight down. And that, even more so than when you're looking out the windows, is when you truly realize how far up you are in one of the highest buildings in the world. You can stay and roam amongst all the different levels for as long as you like.Also, on the bottom level they have a really decent exhibit on the tower's construction and design. And, of course, the whole mall-ful of shopping options as well.This is really an observatory worth visiting.", October 2019
14,4.0,Worth a visit,Magnificent views of Seoul from the Seoul Sky observation deck in Lotte World Tower. There are several floors between the 117 and 120 floors designated to observing the panoramic  views of all of Seoul. There are various cafes and shops located at the top. In addition there are glass floor panels in a few places where you can really test your vertigo! It’s worth the visit to give perspective and an appreciation of the phenomenal development of Seoul., September 2019
15,5.0,A must go attraction!,Amazing attraction! I would highly recommend splurging on getting a drink in the 123 lounge as the view is amazing and it feels very high end! Great date night option as well! If you do go I would suggest getting your tickets on the Klook app! You can buy a bundle pack for most of the Lotte locations for about $50 a person!, September 2019
16,5.0,Seoul Tower a place must visit,"Great view of the entire city from above. It a tourist destination must visit when in Seoul. Just love it! Ticket price at W27,000 per person. The elevator is superb fast. In a few second you are up to the top.", August 2019
17,5.0,최고의 명소라 생각합니다.,단순 전망대뿐만 아니라 쇼핑몰 등 각종 즐길거리가 더해져 최고의 명소 중 한 곳이라 생각합니다.또 방문에 앞서 홈페이지에서 각종 할인 정보를 확인하면 보다 좋을 것입니다.You had better come by website to get discount information before visiting this attractive place., August 2019
18,4.0,A great view of Seoul from top of Lotte World Tower,"I reviewed this as part of Lotte World Tower, forgetting this was called Seoul Sky.  This is a great venue for tourists and families with a number of viewing levels including the fantastic glass observation deck looking down 117 levels!", August 2019
19,4.0,Fantastic views!,"Seoul Sky is an excellent viewing tower with a great glass floor! The price is reasonable and there are the usual gift shops and a nice cafe up there. We unfortunately had a cloudy day which limited the view, try to visit on a clear day for best views!!", July 2019
20,3.0,SEOUL SKY TOWER,"A must spot to visit ,but very commercialised .Just shops in all departments, the main reason for going must be to see Seoul from the viewing towers.", May 2019
21,5.0,Go early on a clear day,"We had five days of cloudy weather in Seoul in early June. We went to the Lotte Tower Seoul Sky on the first sunny day of our trip. I was worried that it would be very crowded on a Saturday, but we got in line for tickets about 30 minutes before the place opened. We were the first people on the elevator. As soon as we got to the top observatory desk, we took photos with very few other people around. After about 15 minutes, large groups of tourists entered and it was much more difficult to take pictures. You cannot buy tickets online unless you have a Korean cell phone. I did buy tickets online through Klook at a slight discount and then showed my phone to the person at the Seoul Sky ticket desk. She printed out our tickets to get on the elevator. I would highly recommend this place, but not on a cloudy or rainy day.", June 2019
22,3.0,5th tallest in the world.,This is the 5th tallest building in the world. observation desk is 360 . ticket cost is 27000 won . Visit only if you haven't experienc any of tallest building.Note: Visit in the evening to experience both day and night view, July 2019
23,5.0,Quite impressed ,"It’s the tallest building in Korea and it really have a beautiful observation deck. It’s at the TOP and even got outdoor deck to take photos. It’s very windy and cold out there though. There are a lot of tourists, so choose to go early in the morning.People stuck at the lower floor to take photo. Try to go to upper floor to take photos as less people. It’s very easy to go as Long as you follow the sign from the subway station.", April 2019
24,4.0,Way Better Than What I Expected,"It was a fine Monday afternoon when we went there.  I've already visited a similar tower in Taiwan last year, and I can say that this is better.  The elevator speed was impressive. Up in the tower,  I felt uneasy but made the most out of my visit by taking pictures. I liked the crystal floor where you can see the ground. The crew members were accommodating and the cafe is well-managed.  On several areas of the viewing decks,  you can have enough space to take pics. People visiting that time seem too happy with their experience. I would definitely recommend this to friends.", June 2019
25,5.0,Go around sunset ,"Impressively tall building. I bought the ticket at the desk, no queues. I paid extra for the 123 Lounge on the 123rd floor (unsurprisingly!) Worth the extra as it covers the cost of a beer and the views are amazing. It has a glass floor section of course and it’s always amusing to see the less intrepid tip-toe onto it. If you like tall buildings, this has to be on the list.", June 2019
26,5.0,You can see a long way!,"I think this is the 8th tallest building in the world, and as such, it offers some spectacular views of Seoul. We sat in the bar overlooking the old Olympic site, and it was a stunning view. From the rest of the vantage points you could see the city in a totally different light. Well worth doing! We didn’t book ahead, we arrived around 1030 and the line wasn’t too long, so don’t worry too much if you’re a last minute planner", May 2019
27,5.0,Amazing views!,I really loved this place. The views were amazing and I even walked on the glass floor. Really nice bars and restaurants with good food and great beer., January 2019
28,4.0,"Great view, good place to take pictures",Went in the evening of a clear day and the views were very impressive. Elevator was rapid and there's multiple floors so not very crowded. Took the time to enjoy the view and take pictures with my new camera., April 2019
29,4.0,"Awesome view, but pick your day...","This place is super cool, but not super cheap, so be aware of the air quality when you decide to visit. We had friends that went on a Saturday and saw basically nothing, and we went the very next day and got post-card-worthy views. So for real--- check the local weather reports.The elevator ride is cool and super fast. It's fun to step out over 120 floors of ""nothing,"" quite a few places to buy food/snacks/drinks, and again, on a good day, a view you won't forget.", February 2019
30,1.0,Seoul Sky - Bad experience on Service and responsibility of service condition,"I visited Seoul Sky on 18 Apr 2019 and didn't notice that there was too much smoke in the sky or not, but staff ignored to inform any proper info to us. They just sell ticket and cannot speak English. In the entrance area, Service staff also delivered bad service to guests, not provide any info and forced us to walk into the gate urgently. Finally, we have failed to see anything on the top. There were too much smoke. I just wondered that why they want to sell the tickets without considering the guests would be satisfied on view on not. If customers have no chance to see clearly on that day, they shouldn't sell any tickets. So weird!!!!!", April 2019
31,5.0,Great photos here!,Several floors to visit...lots of photo ops....get a drink at the top.  Go during the day when its less busy, April 2019
32,5.0,Top of the World at Seoul,Visited Seoul Sky during lunch time on a Saturday and it wasn't too crowded to our delight.  We booked through Klook which offered some discount to the entrance tickets.The view from the top is magnificent and worth to be there!, April 2019
33,5.0,Really Amazing,"Seoul Sky Observation Deck is certainly a must do when visiting Seoul. The tour is very well organised, with English-speaking guides at every step. The best time to visit is towards evening – one can see the Seoul skyline....then the sunset...and finally the city lights as they come on. It is a truly amazing experience!! The view from the glass floor can be scary for those having a fear of heights. There are other attractions too – souvenir shops, cafes, photographers – but the best is the artist making sketches while you pose before him!! It takes only a few minutes to do, and can be a souvenir for lifetime!!!This is one experience not to be missed in Seoul.", March 2019
34,4.0,It's get better base on Weather,"Dust fogging up Seoul is a big issue, so watching for clear sky is the biggest factor when going to Seoul Sky. It offers a beautiful 360 view of Seoul. Even the elevator ride is cool with it's visual presentation prior to reaching for the skies. As with most attractions, there's plenty of stop along the way to get that perfect picture for purchase just in case the selfie's and the weather is not all that great because they always have a beautiful blue sky. There's plenty to do around the area, so it worth the going on if you can catch good weather.", February 2019
35,4.0,High and Higher!,"Yes, it is a must do and see. The tour to the sky tower.It so well organized. All  in such young hands. You have to do the foto shopping tour. It was fun and you have a nice remembrance.The weather was good and clear, so we had a fine view.Our hotel was just in front of the Sky Tower, so we had also a perfect night view.", April 2019
36,5.0,Better than Namsan Tower in Many Ways,"I love Namsan Tower; however, it is a hike to get to and the weather has to be in your favor.   I visited Seoul Sky this past summer (in July) and would recommend Seoul Sky for everyone, especially if you have someone in your group with health issues where going to Namsan tower (walking up incline hills, many stairs, etc) is not easy.   Seoul Sky, you simply go to Lotte Mall and use the elevator. No hills or stairs involved.  They have a glass bottom floor in the observatory which is really cool.  You have a great view looking down at the castle in Lotte World Adventure Park.", July 2018
37,5.0,Seoul Sky,"Unbelievable view! Although the sky was a bit unclear, we could see far and beyond. Monies worth....", January 2019
38,5.0,Breathtaking View,"It's so beautiful. We went there around 4:30pm , after playing in Lotteworld. We see the day view, sunset view and night view from the Seoul Sky Tower. Tallest in Seoul. One of the tallest in the world too. It's so beautiful !!!", February 2019
39,5.0,Majestic View,"The 5th tallest building in the world.. world's fastest double decker elevator.. tallest building in South Korea.. whether day or night, spring summer fall or winter it's worth the experience to go here. Consists of 123 floors and the glass observatory is located on the 117th to 123rd floor. You'll see a 360 degrees panoramic view of the entire Seoul city. Plus it will only take you 1 minute from the basement to the observatory.", December 2018
40,4.0,My first experience in the top of the building ,"Before getting to Seoul, I was searching interesting places in the Internet. There were a lot of, but I was about to go somewhere I’ve never been to. So I decided it will be Lotte Tower, because it was the nearest place to Gangnam-where my apartments were. My first goal in Seoul was watchin’ the city and in the morning I was at language school. That’s why I didn’t have much time for attractions. The day before my last day in Seoul I finally planned to go to observation desk. It was easy to got there by subway and fast indeed. I think it’s the cheapest way, except going by foot.When you are in the station it seems to you that it’s an another world. Awesome walls, everything is so colorful, like you are in the fairy tale, but I had to follow the indexes to find Tower. Staff is able to speak English, they could help you to find ticket window or anything else. The price of my ticket was about 27$. In few minutes I was getting up to 118th floor by sky shuttle. Then you can go up to the 120th floor to terrace(there were freezing because of wind).In the 118th there is a transparent part of floor and and if you were getting close to the floor you’ll see some different parts of the city.By chance, I fortunately saw the sunset and it was really breathtakingly. So I didn’t regret that I had got to there.", August 2018
41,2.0,Not practical for disabled person’s family ,My sister and I took my mom here for sky tower. From the beginning they made us separate because only one person allowed to carry the wheelchair. It’s is so hard to meet after we separated. Couldn’t take a group picture and needed call each other’s where we are. So inconvenient service., January 2019
42,4.0,Amazing view...glass floor,"I was dubious about going to this attraction--everyone has been in a tall building--but it was fascinating.  The lower level explains the construction and engineering which was more interesting that i expected.  The elevator up is only a minute and is one of the fastest elevators--there are all sorts of guiness record book items to quote.  I really liked the glass bottom floor, but it took me awhile to step out on it.  Take a picture looking down with your shoes in it for perspective.  I wish we had longer as i would have liked to enjoy a cocktail in the lounge and look at the view!", December 2018
43,4.0,Great view with good weather ,"Nice view from above on Seoul. Gives a good impression of the city. It is worth a visit, but a little pricey.", November 2018
44,5.0,Amazing view!,The very quick elevator trip was the best as there were LED screens inside where a video is played to entertain the audience. And the drop off point is on the 117th floor where the view of the whole city can be seen. You can go up to the 123rd floor and each floor offers different activities., November 2018
45,5.0,Worth the Money!,"Being 500 meters up is not something you do every day. you can selfie yourself to death, on 121, 122 and 124 floor and have a great coffee at the upper-level lounge.  come before sunset and enjoy day, sunset and night time up in the air.", October 2018
46,1.0,View!,Amazing view. 6 storey to appreciate the the beauty of the skyline at a different level. Only thing they can do better is the restaurant manager at the 123 floor not to be snobbish if we happened to be up there not for dinning but just to see how the restaurant is like. Just because we are not dinning there doesn't mean we can't afford to eat there and hence the snobbish treatment., October 2018
47,5.0,Wondeful view all round,"Must be there early, the queue gets quite long even on a weekday. Went up first during my visit, had enough time to take photos and go out to the deck. Do walk on the glass floor which is scary and thrilling at the same time. Since its way high up, you can see have a great view all round. Great experience", October 2018
48,5.0,trip to 555,Amazing amazing amazing !!!!!!!i was there at around 330 and loved it ....would strongly suggest to let photographers to do the sunset timing the view is spectacular ....good for everyone ...., October 2018
49,5.0,Highlight of my Seoul trip,This place was the highlight of my trip to Seoul! Make sure that you will go there before sunset so you can stay and also see the night view. The entrance fee might be steep but you will forget it once you get to the top. The views were all awesome and jaw dropping!, September 2018
50,4.0,"High tech and great views, but.. ","Great tower, high tech around, great views, but... not nuch things to do..  just watch the horizont and wait... no other thing", October 2018
51,5.0,Definitely worth the time and the money,"This was at least 1,000 times cooler than I expected.  The glass floors, and the views are amazing.  The elevator ride itself is super cool, and probably worth doing in itself.  There are some refreshments at the top of the tower, which is pretty nice.  I am very glad we did this, and I would certainly do this again.", July 2018
52,5.0,Breathtaking Views ,"Take metro to Jamsil station (metro line 2 or 8)  Buy tickets to the observatory deck at B2. Wasn't crowded on a weekday. 27,000 won for adults (ages 13 and up), 24000 won for children. The observatory deck offers an unparalleled 360-degree view of Seoul. Would prefer this to N Seoul Tower anyday.", September 2018
53,5.0,One in a Lifetime Amazing Experience!!!,"A must do & see. Had an amazing time 123 floors up, over 500 meters above ground, standing on the world’s highest see-through sky deck in the 5th tallest building in the world.", September 2018
54,4.0,Precious view of Seoul,It is fun to go up so fast to 117 floors in a double-deck elevator.  The view is most precious at sunset so try to go between 5 and 7pm depending on the season so you can watch the sunset and night., August 2018
55,5.0,Highly recommend having a beer at the top,Breathtaking views of seoul. Fifth tallest building in the world. Enjoy a beer and a snack on the 123rd floor. This was my second time in Korea and the second time i went up to the top of seoul sky building. Its truly breathtaking., August 2018

61,4.0,Beautiful sight of Seoul,"I was sooo moved when I saw the whole Seoul on Seoul Sky. My friends and I went to Seoul Sky for my 3rd day of Seoul. We spent the whole day at Lotte world adventure the day before so we were very tired at that time. HOWEVER we could totally forget our tiredness immediately while going up. It was reallyyyy fast!! I was a bit scared but I could be patient of it because it took just a minute. And then I could see Seoul, literally Seoul Sky. I appreciated to my friend. Thanks to my friend, I got 10% discount on Admission fee via Visit Korea Mastercard.", March 2018
62,5.0,"It was time well spent, I enjoyed my visit","The entrance and ticket windows are located inside of Lotte World department store. I got there in the afternoon, around 1 pm. There was no lines. Everything looked very well organized. It is worth the price of admission. The views are gorgeous.The glass is relatively clean, it is easy to make a good quality photo through the glass. I am attaching few of my photos as an example. The deck itself has 3 levels. It was not crowded. There were people around of course, but there was enough space to quietly enjoy the views and to take pictures without being disturbed. There is a souvenir shop on the top and also another one on the ground when you exit. There is a snack shop on the top as well. There is Godiva coffee shop on the store floor opposite to the ticket counter. I can highly recommend their chocolate ice cream. So tasty!All in all I can recommend a visit. It was money well spent. Just make sure the weather is nice and sunny before boarding the metro train to Seoul Sky.", November 2017
63,5.0,Unforgetable Experienced!,"It was my first time to visit Seoul.Our tour guide was so excited and enthusiastic to bring us around so I just enjoy the tour I appreciate most the glass floor at sky tower, enjoy taking photos of my shoes stepping on the glass floor and looking as high as I am from below I like the wide view also of Lotte towers and the way the building was arranged at Seoul, I visited most towers around the world and Seoul is one of my type, I enjoy being there because our korean guide made it memorable for me. I like the outside view also and the way the lift was build up. Going up to 120 storey will take 1 minute only and aside from being fast, you can see the history of korea how they become like what they are now, its quite interesting and enjoyable. I like every moment of it. Its unforgetable specially, when with someone special who is willing to spend time with you.Its the best thing that happened tome from all of my tower visits.Enjoy the moments!", November 2017
64,5.0,Stunning scenery of Seoul from Skyscraper,"Seoul Sky is the tallest building in Seoul. You can see the great scenery of Seoul for 360 degree. If the weather is so great, you also can see it far to Songdo, Incheon City. The ticket is not cheap.

72,4.0,Great view and nice experience,"This is highest tower in town with great view of the city. From 120th floor you can have a panoramic city, Han viver and all buidings, houses. It is very nice at night. Just only thing is that the queue is quite long so we had to wait quite long. The design and setting up indide are not impressive, not unique and special.The view is just great !", November 2017
73,4.0,Great Experience,"When we visited the observation deck of Lotte Tower, it was not very crowded and this made the experience fantastic. This is the third-tallest observation deck in the world and it has the highest glass floor in the world. There's also ""balconies"" which are more like a portion without a ceiling since the windows are still a storey high. Overall, we really enjoyed seeing and experiencing the tower. I wish I could rate it 4.5 because the view isn't as nice as the view from N Tower (however, the experience is much better).", September 2017

76,5.0,Out to Explore,This tower has many angles of the city to veiw it is just incredible once you get to the top of the tower there are many places where you can get a goofd picture of the city or with yourself in it if not there are various points whete they would take them for you. There is also two step out decks where you wouls see right down to the bottom of the tower.Then you can choose which pictures you would like to be printed of the picture's that were taken...this is not expensive compared to many other places i have been too.Good Luck to you, October 2017
77,5.0,Amazing views of Seoul,Visited with my husband and daughter. Well worth the KRW27000 per adult entrance fee. There is an exhibit at the lower level before heading onto the elevator area. The elevator takes you to the 118th floor in a couple of minutes!You can find a gift shop and coffee shop at the observation deck.The highlight is the glass floored area where you can have your pictures taken. The N Seoul Tower looks so small from this vantage point. :), September 2017
78,5.0,Well worth every KWon for Fast Pass,We visited on a public holiday to find queues that would take a couple of hours to gain admission at KW27000 each.However KW50000 (usd44) bought a Fast Pass ticket which was literally that. We were escorted past long lines to the lift which then took us to the Sky Deck on Floor 118 which is approx 480m above ground.....the trip took less than one minute!!! You can then go up to 122 floor at no additional cost or for a small fee to 123 floor. The view over Seoul and the surrounding metropolis is superb and we were very fortunate that the weather was totally clear with not one cloud to spoil it. The Sky Deck has a glass floor near the edge allowing you to look straight down onto the ant-like people and vehicles below.The tower was opened only in April 2017 and is located within Lotte World complex in Olympic Way. Thus it is a very new attraction but one that will surely rise to #1 very soon, October 2017
79,5.0,Amazing view,"It is something stunning!!! At level 0, after the ticket office you can see a movie from during the construction of this tower - the first shock (for the civil engineers it is very interesting). In the lift you will see a movie about ancient Seoul -  a very nice introduction of the city. When you arrive at 118 floor the view is wow!!! At the next floor it is a glass floor - stiunning view of the earth under youre foot. Next floor it is a terrace at 486 m. This visit it wort every won!!!", September 2017
80,4.0,Have a coffee at 122 floor,"We went to the Seoul sky at the morning time, beautiful view with no rain, we start our journey from the lift, seeing the ancient Seoul develop into Morden time Seoul. Just a few seconds we had already reach to 117/floor.  Impressive view was the first feeling! We walk around the floor and watch the surounding buildings down below were just like toys.  On the 118 floor  two sky deck will prove whether you are afraid the height or not.  After that, we take a coffee break at the 122 floor .  A place must try as you can see the landscape changing.  Will go there again from sunset to night.", September 2017
81,4.0,Astonishing Seoul view!,"The observatory just opened to the public on this year April. You may expect a big crowd (including the locals) purchasing the tickets especially during sunset. Try to allocate some time when selecting the time slot because you need to pass through the security scan and wait the lift to arrive. Remember to get ready with your phone when the lift is going up to the top.I managed to see the sunset and the 360 degree of city view was amazing. However, it might be crowded (at observatory area and cafes) and need to queue again to get back to the ground floor.", September 2017
82,4.0,Amazing view from 478m Seoul Sky tower,"If you are wondering if it's worth paying W27,000 per person to go up to Seoul Sky - it's a resounding yes! I was reluctant initially but the views from the 117 - 121 floors are amazing and breathtaking. There's also a glass floor where you can step out on and you'll enjoy the experience if you do not succumb to vertigo. Definitely a recommended experience.There the ubiquitous Lotte hotel, mall, dept store and theme park within the same compound so you can make a day visit of everything.", September 2017
83,5.0,"View is absolutely amazing, breathtaking, stunning, daebak.........","Seoul sky is above the Lotte World Mall and next to the Lotte World at the Jamsil Station.IT is made up of a few levels. level 117 is the observation deck. 118 is the glass floor where you can see all the way down to the ground. A outdoor viewing platform and also 2 cafes and souvenir shops at the above levels. Finally a premium lounge on the top.You can stay up there as long as you wish. But their coffee and cakes seem to be selling really fast, better have a meal first before go up there.They will also scan your belongings before you are allowed to go up there, like what they did at the airport.Best time to visit is around sunset and nighfall", August 2017
84,4.0,Tallest building in Seoul,"It is nice place to visit the Seoul Sky. They have glass on the 20th floor(if I could remember it well) for you to step on and see below. If you are not scared, you can try it, very cool experience.", August 2017
85,5.0,Must go if u r visiting Seoul,You could see beautiful scenery to city view and N tower looks beautiful from so far. I loved watching sunset from its top floor lounge. Go In evening so that you can see city in day and then at night., August 2017
86,5.0,U must visit here,this building is gorgeous. so so big. it also has a glass floor that allows you to see down below. this is one of my favorite sky scrapers that i visited., June 2017
87,5.0,Must visit!!,"Seoul Sky!! The newest skyscraper in Seoul that offers more than just 360deg view of the city. It has many decks you can have for yourself without nudging elbows with other tourists. The interiors are quite new you can smell them as you enter that awesome LED entrance and that LED hallway leading up to that uber fast elevator which is just as awesome as well. It has lesser crowds compared to N-Seoul and quite expectedly, more expensive but well worth your buck! The biggest come-on is the vertigo inducing glass transparent floor. Test that phobia of yours if you can!!", June 2017
88,5.0,An amazing experience!,"This is one of the places that I was planning to have a look while I was in Seoul. It was very high with plenty of advanced technology and the rapid elevator took us to the 118F~120F of the tower! It was so amazing, and I also took a picture as souvenir there! What a great experience!", July 2017
89,4.0,If you love going up tall buildings this is worth a visit,"Had a day free in Seoul and thought it would be fun to go up the Lotte World Tower. I enjoy going up tall buildings so was great to have a chance to add the world's fifth tallest to my personal list. I was surprised I did not need to book. I just turned up and bought a ticket on the day (around lunchtime on a Sunday) and was able to get on the next lift / elevator up. The inside of the elevator is very cool with surround screens. There are several floors of viewing platforms. The glass platforms are fun, particularly the one with glass that is blanked out when you walk onto it and then is switched to clear mode to show the view below. The open air areas are nice too and good for photos. Like one of the other reviews, I think the owners could make a lot more of the fact it is 5th tallest building in world and also have more info on the construction.", June 2017
90,4.0,Mother Nature did not cooperate.,"On my last day in Seoul, my brother's brother-in-law (referenced hereafter as Brotha) took me here to check out Lotte World Tower for the view.  We got there a little early (before 9 AM) so we spent some time walking around the massive Lotte empire.Talk about cool!  From the lobby to the entrance and the walk to the elevator, you are inundated with sights and sounds building up the buzz of what you are about to see!  The elevator ride alone to the top was very entertaining.  When the doors opened atop though, Mother Nature was showing us that she was not interested in cooperating as visibility was near zero.We killed some time at the coffee bar and kept our fingers crossed.  30 minutes later, some of the fog had lifted though not anywhere what was needed to allow us to see the many views that would've otherwise been realized on a clear day.Like many of the other tall towers out there (Eiffel Tower, Tokyo Tower, CN Tower, Space Needle), there is a glass floor that you can stand on and take pictures of the drop below.  This one gets extra points though as b/c of its relative newness, the glass is essentially scratch free and clear as the waters of the Caribbean.Though we did not get to see miles upon miles out, it was still a neat experience.  Be sure to check out the weather forecast before you decide whether or not you want to visit.  Pricing is reasonable (~$30) to zip to the top per person.Great drinks atop as well as nice selection of souvenirs.", July 2017
91,5.0,Excellent new Observatory!,"Organized and well-done observatory. We went to the top on a somewhat cloudy day and still thoroughly enjoyed the observation decks, the glass floors and all of the views. Very well signed and a beautiful new building!", July 2017
92,5.0,"amazing views, great fun","Enjoyed going up here with some colleagues recently, what a lot of fun! the glass floor had a few people scared at first but then we all loved it. Amazing views, and all the explanations at what you are looking at.", June 2017
93,5.0,Amazing! ,"Staff were beautiful and friendly and informative. The amount of work that has gone into building the tower and putting other electronic elements to enhance the experience is inspiring!! Visability was poor, but we could see enough to enjoy the experience. I definitely recommend this, but maybe try it at night time too.", July 2017
94,5.0,Well worth it,"I went as part of a small group of adults on a weeknight shortly after it opened. There were a few dozen people waiting but the whole situation was very well managed, with no delays and something to look at or do while shuffling towards the lifts. On the upper levels there was some very sensible crowd control which didn't detract from the experience at all. The outside deck was OK but the clear floor section was the most fun by far.There was a souvenir corner with a decent range of stuff and some very expensive coffee / snacks. Even though the visibility was fairly poor it was still worth it.", May 2017
95,5.0,"Very Generous Observation Decks (yes, many decks!)","I went here with my wife and two teen age daughters on a Wednesday noon. We avoid weekends as most tourist sites are usually full. But it's already summer in Seoul and most students all over the country are in holiday.The cost is KRW 27,000 per person (adults. foreigners). My daughter who studies in Korea got a discount.Not that crowded and there was around 20-25 people in our batch. When you buy the ticket you'll be asked to choose which time batch you prefer. Each time batch got 30 minutes. Not sure if one can be satisfied with only 30 minutes visit at the observation deck. In our case, perhaps since it was weekdays, all visitors can stay as long as they want.From entrance to elevator we were guided through corridors with information on Seoul Sky construction. Visitors were entertained with images of light. So beautiful!The elevator took visitors in high speed and very convenient. As if it was only some 25-30 storeys. Inside the elevators we were entertained with digital images of the city from all four-sides of elevator's interior. I forgot which floor we stopped. We were asked to continue using escalators to observation deck above. But before that the hall is already an observation deck! You can see several parts of the city.After the escalator you will arrive at the observation deck. Unfortunately the sky was cloudy and view was limited. But still several view could be seen.At the observation deck there were LED monitors visitors can watch. Some spots provide cameras to take a picture of you. Just scan the QR Code on your ticket, and look at the camera. There's a screen mirroring your pose. You can get the printed picture at souvenir shop.Going upstairs, another observation deck. This time a better & huge camera can take a picture of you sitting/ standing on the thick glass floor! Again with QR Code.If you bought the picture you can download the digital picture, given a code.Other than the decks, there were coffee shops. I think there were two. From the seats you can enjoy the view too.The souvenir shop was fun too. I bought a miniature of the tower, to complete my collection of landmark miniatures.In my opinion, in overall experience, SeoulSky was the BEST! I've been to many skyscrapers, and Seoul Sky gave the best experience right from buying the ticket, entrance hall, decks, and return to ground floor.", June 2017
96,5.0,"If you're dropping by Lotte World, stop here first! ","My family and I (4 adults and 1 child) visited the Seoul Sky Tower on a Saturday morning. Much to our shock, there was no line even though we went around noon time. (I'm supposing because the ticket costs around 27,000 won) I suggest you go when the sky is clear, so that you can see the spectacular view of Seoul! When we visited, we saw the different stadiums, Lotte World, etc. Apart from the world's highest glass observation deck (which is super cool btw), there's a cafe and a gift shop in the top floors, too~ you can sit in the cafe, drink some coffee, and watch the view!", June 2017
97,5.0,A Must if you are in Seoul,"The view of the city was not crisp clear because of the smog but still, it was breathtaking to take the panorama of the whole city; perhaps at night you may appreciate a more spectacular view. The walk on the glass floor that shows everything below the tower was the best! I could have stayed for at least thirty minutes admiring the view under if it weren't for the place getting crowded with huge groups of tourists. Definitely try visiting on weekdays.Before entering the elevator that takes you to the Observatory, they take a picture of you- picture you can buy as a souvenir on you're up. Here's a secret tip to follow discretely: If you don't want to pay for the souvenir photo grab your phone or camera and casually take a shot at the sample photo that you're being shown on the screen of the machines from where you can purchase the photos.", June 2017
98,5.0,Tremenous Views,"The tallest observation tower in Seoul which opened a few months ago is a definite ""must see"" sight.    There are 6 observation decks from floors 118 to 123.  At floor 123 you are 555 meters above groound.   Each deck commands a magnificent 360 degree view of the Seoul metropolitan area and the Han River.    Landmarks are well marked and identified on each level.  You can even venture outside on an outdoor deck. Lots of great photo opportunities.    I definitely will return for a second visit.  Subway station to the Lotte World Tower is on the Green Line (2) at stop number 216 Jamsil (Songpa-gu Office)", June 2017
99,5.0,A highlight,"Only opening the month prior, and being the 5th tallest tower in the world, I was interested in checking it out.  And wasn't disappointed.  The elevator takes you to the 117th floor (ears popped a few times).  The clear platform to look down made me a bit ""swimmy""!The view on the 123rd floor was amazing (as was the price of a drink!)  We enjoyed, dusk and sunset, with a gent playing the clarinet.  A spectacular view.", May 2017
100,5.0,Definitely worth your time to go up,"My husband and I were debating to go up, it's a little steep for admission, but we were very surprised by how great it was once we got up.  There are 4 different floors to explore as well as a restaurant at the 123rd floor.  We knew everything would be pricey, so we just ordered the cheese plate ($23 US) and were shocked at how big it was!  It was the perfect snack for us as we wanted to eat elsewhere that night but it was worth going up to the top for it.  The views were stunning that day and hardly anyone to compete with the view.  We stayed a couple hours (that is a lot for us) and just soaked in the view.", May 2017
101,5.0,Great city view without a line,"Surprisingly, we had no wait time! Maybe it's new or maybe because we went on a Friday around noon. Not sure. In any case, we enjoy the view of the city. Our day was clear (as it gets in Seoul) so you get to see very far. How to buy tickets: 1) one way is on their website or app. I tried it first on the mobile website but it was little cumbersome and there were plenty of tickets available every 30 minutes slots so I gave up. But, maybe if it's busier, this is the best method to avoid lines. 2) buy tickets when you get their. It's in English. The ticket booth is on B1 (basement) of Lotte Tower shopping mall. There's signs in English for ""Observatory"" direction when you get to B1. Same floor as subway station. There's multiple floors when you get up there. It's escalator driven between these floors. So, there's spaces to move around if it gets crowded. We only brought our phone cameras. if you have one, bring a real camera with flash to get good lighting of indoor (pics of you) and outside skyline. There's a coffee shop and gift store up there. Also, another gift store when you get back down. So, no need to feel pressured or rushed to buy something up there. We didn't noticed any tours or guides when you get up. It's pretty much on your own.Last thing we noticed is that we left around 1:30pm and we saw big tour groups checking in at B1. So, not sure on timing. Usually, Seoul tourist spots are typically not very busy in the morning. So, if you want to avoid the crowds, maybe morning or early afternoon are best. Not sure. I'm sure early evenings would be great to see with the sunset, etc.", June 2017
102,4.0,Miss b,"Fantastic sights of the river, seoul tower and the Olympic park. Down side is that if you go at night it's extremely difficult to take any photos as even the outside viewing deck has glass surrounding it and the reflection  from internal lights spoils the photos. Busy, but worth doing.", May 2017
103,4.0,3rd highest observatory in the world,"I was lucky enough to have visited the Lotte Sky Tower observatory during the first week of its official opening to the public so I got to experience everything while it was still new which was nice. Experience wise though, there were more misses than hits in my opinion, considering that I make it a point to visit any observation tower/building in the country that I visit.Starting from the bottom up, the queues during the opening week were pretty manageable when I visited in the evening (around 8plus) and we only spent around 20 minutes in total to queue up for ticket purchase and the lift. So far, not too bad compared to the 30 min wait I experienced at Taipei 101. I do wish that they didn't pack the people into the lift for the 1 minute ride though - I would be willing to wait for the next car if it gave me just that bit more of breathing room. The double deck design of the lift is pretty cool though you can't see it in action. The graphics in the lift were nice (it shows you Seoul through the ages) but if you don't understand any Korean then just look at the pretty pictures.At first I was interested in how special the 5 levels of observatory would be like in terms of different experiences. Maybe it was because it just opened, but I kind of felt that it was rather bare? Other observation decks in the world have signages or displays boasting of that particular building's uniqueness - I only found out through Google after I left that Lotte Tower is the tallest building currently in the OECD and 5th tallest in the world and that the Sky Tower is the 3rd highest observatory in the world. Looking out at the views were nice, but I would have liked to know what or which direction I was looking at. The one interactive screen we saw didn't really tell us much.The very cool glass floors that we could step on and look down at the ground below were the saving grace for Lotte Sky Tower. Especially the one that is controlled by the staff - that was fun especially if you have no fear of heights. However, depending on the crowd with you on the day you visit, you might not get much space or time on the glass deck.The outdoor observation deck was nothing much to shout about and was rather small. The only nice part about it was the chilly weather at the time when I visited.The photo booth system was a bit of a mess the week I went - probably due to teething problems. People had no idea where to queue to self-review their photos and some foreign tourists had problems communicating with the counter staff.The souvenir shop has a small but curated selection of items, but mostly the same things that you will find in most souvenir shops.Now, if you fancy a drink or two, the bar/lounge at the highest level is a great place to sit and relax. Classy atmosphere, drinks and attentive waitstaff - impress your guy or girl here. Otherwise, I would advise you skip the cafe and go back down to the shopping mall instead where there are restaurants and cafes.Overall, it's a good way to spend 30-45 minutes of your trip to say that you've been up the 5th tallest building in the world (for now). I do hope they'll improve and add more interesting facts or interactive displays like Taipei 101 or Hong Kong's Sky 100.", April 2017
104,5.0,Sky tower 117th to 123rd floors,"Zip to the 117th floor of the 5th tallest building in the world for a thrilling, panoramic view of Seoul from Jamsil.

105,3.0,Up high but,"At night too much interior light glare on windows to get clear photos, and both Terrace closed for weather.  Late in evening no lineup and whisked to top, kind of sparse up there but it is new.  At Jamsil subway station, many other Lotte brand stores surrounding.", May 2017
106,2.0,Great idea,"I know Lotte World aren't responsible for the poor air quality in Seoul, but to build such an impressive tower with such a well planned observation area seems somewhat shortsighted (pun intended). With a viewing deck at 485 metres (double that of the shard), I would expect to see into the future, but visibility was just about limited to 10km on the day I visited which was very incredibly disappointing (but I am aware is par in this part of the world)Once you get to the viewing area (via the super fast lift - around 100 floors in a minute!), it was mob rule. Lying on the glass deck appears to be a favoured pose. Thats fine. But having to step over dozens of others to get to the edge was irking. Then repeat to exit. Walk to the other side of the platform. Repeat. And so on.I understand it hasn't been open for long so maybe with time things will settle down and some good old fashion queues will start to pop up to instil a spot of order to proceedings. Or maybe they could charge for anti social posing...In the meantime, sharpen your elbows and check the forecast for the day.", May 2017
107,5.0,Seoul Sky,"27,000 may be a little expensive for this observatory but the fact that is brand new makes up for it. Long lines to get in for the same reason. A lot of good souvenirs availables. The view on top is pretty amazing", April 2017
108,4.0,"Beautiful views, good crowd control, but check visibility before you go","My husband and I enjoyed visiting the Seoul Sky observatory, though we would recommend checking the air quality/visibility level before you go. Visibility was only 6 km the morning we went, and though the views of the city were still quite impressive it could have been much more exciting on a clearer day. We took the subway to Jamsil station to access the tower. The elevator to the top of the tower/observatory is amazingly fast and offers smooth ride more than 100+ floors up in 60 seconds! We thought the staff did a great job controlling the crowds and were able to see everything we wanted to at the observatory. We also had the good fortune of witnessing the Korean Black Angels jets practicing for an air acrobatics demonstration while we were there! It was a great visit overall.", April 2017
109,5.0,Skip your heartbeat on the glass floor at 120+ level,"It is thrilling ,  you will skip heartbeats as you tread over the glass floor on the Sky observatories  of Seoul's spanking new  tallest tower , ""The Lotte tower"" .  You may be scared  for the first few minutes after which with trepidation you may look down at the skyscrapers  below this tower which look like dwarfs ! The beautiful river Han flows by and you get a majestic view of that , From all angles you get a wide Panaromic view of the beautiful city of Seoul . There are two sides of the tower and each has glass floors . The river side is obviously more beautiful . Standing at 118 floor at about 480 meters you feel very very high .....much more than observatory of worlds tallest tower ""the burj Khalifa"" which is actually 800 meters tall (observatory is at about 555 Meters) . I have been to both ....The effect is due to glass ....you are standing in air at so much height !!  in burj Khalifa you are on a solid deck ...Seoul observatory is definitely an out of the world experience ..i think only one of its kind in the world . Another attraction is the elevator ....it gives you glimpse of architecture of Seoul thru the ages and .. it is visual treat !! , it is a seamless surround  vivid 3D display  !! no wonder this is in the country of Samsung and LG !! .  The entrance lobby itself is a tech gizmo  of full wall and roof displays.if you are in Seoul Dont miss this .", April 2017
110,4.0,A little expensive and wait time long but a good view and great use of technology,I had already gone up 63 tower and that is where i noticed this huge building so thought i would check it out. You line up once to go in at the ticket time. Then line up again for photo security. Then line up on exhibit floor. Then get let around the corner to.. Another line. Then you get let in through doors to Another line! Then again through a set off doors to line up at the elevator! All this took 40 minutes in itself and i was one of the first for my tickets 30 minute time slot. Each time slot they sell at least 400 tickets to so could get ugly.While lining up there are some nice displays in screens and in the elevator it seems the whole thing is used as a display. Very nicely doneAs mentioned by others there are several floors. You go up by escalator to each one but there is a lift and stairs if you wish to come back and forth between floors. Windows are sadly quite dirty but didn't show up too badly in most of my photos. Some great views but to be honest i felt the views from 63 tower were better. That may have been a combination of slightly clearer day and not as high.63 tower is less than half the price so personally I'd probably go for that one but this is a nice new tower and double the height. Just be prepared to wait in lots of lines if it's busy to get up there (my session still had 250 or so tickets to sell at the start time). I spent less time up there than i did waiting to get upAlso they listed downstairs an example of visibility. So you could know before you went up. Just be aware it seems that if you could see something even faintly they marked it as visible so when i got up there it was a little disappointing in that respect, May 2017
111,4.0,Great View!!,"Felt very excited and looked forward to visit Seoul Sky observatory tower (World’s Third Highest Observatory). We went on the weekend and hence really crowded (mostly locals). Number of people going up the tower per session (30 mins apart) were limited and it costs ₩27,000 per adult. We anticipated a lot on the glass-floored observation deck and the double-deck sky shuttle elevator which can move at a speed of 600m per minute (world's fastest). The elevator will stop at the 117th floor and we can view the entire city through the glass walls on all sides. It was impressive.From 117th floor onwards you would have to take the escalator up each floor. The glass-floored deck is on 118th floor. It's  interesting and fascinating as we looked down and through the floor. We could see moving vehicles on the road and feel the height of the tower. However, it was really hard to take perfect shots due to crazy crowd at the glass deck. There were souvenirs shop, ice cream shop, etc too.Overall, it was a good to visit for first-timers. Go during weekdays with less crowd to have more opportunity to take good pictures.To get here, take Seoul subway line 2, alight at Jamsil station and get out from exit 2. Walk further in and you will be able to see ""Seoul Sky"" and the tickets sales counters. The counter staffs can speak english, so no worries.", April 2017
112,3.0,Great view but expensive,"I was here in the week it opened so everything was very clean and very new. The lift up to floor 117 is very fast- apparently the Guinness Record holder for fastest lift. As you go up/ or come down, you are treated to a little show in the lift taking you across the skyline of Seoul. It's quite good. Staff were very attentive.You get out on floor 117 and go up stairs to 122. The view is great on a clear day- unfortunately the windows were very dirty so the photos all have streaks through them- but hey, who'd be silly enough to clean those windows?? It was 27,000won to enter which I felt was a little steep for a 30 min experience. There is a coffee shop at the top.", April 2017
113,5.0,world's highest glass-floored observation deck!!!,"For 27,000 korean won, this is a worth-while attraction. With its elevator travelling 500m per minute, its already a one of a kind experience. We went around lunchtime on a weekday, so its not crowded, although they only allow limited number of people at a time, majority of visitors are local tourists.The day was a bit hazy but the view all around is still impressive!!!", April 2017
114,4.0,One of the best observatories in the world.,"I am a fan of tall buildings and their observatories.  A goal of mine is to visit all top 10 tallest buildings in the world so when I heard that Lotte World Tower was finally going to open (after several delays), I just had to catch a plane to Seoul and check it out for myself on the fourth day it was open to the public.The new Seoul Sky Observatory represents my sixth of the top 10 buildings in the world that I have visited.  It was one of the better ones that I have visited.  Better (IMO) than the Shanghai Tower (opened in 2015) but not as good as One World Trade in NYC (opened in 2014).  One thing that totally shocked me was that there were no crowds or lines at all.  I figured that showing up just a few days after it opened with no reserved tickets would condemn me to a long wait in line, but there was no line and I was able to purchase a ticket (27000 KRW - about $24 USD) and go right up. Or you can pick a later time to visit.  I would definitely not buy the 50,000 KRW fastpast as there was no need.  There was no buildup to the elevator ride such as with other observatories which have large displays to keep you entertained while you wait in line for the elevator.  Of course there is the obligatory take your photo for later purchase setup.Elevator ride was smooth (world's first double decker elevator) but you can't tell that from the inside.  There is a progression of the growth of Seoul as you ride the elevator.You get off at the 117th floor.  This is a good place to start, but don't spend much time here as there is nothing really to see except to look out the window (with little signage) to point out what you are looking at.  Proceed to go up to the 118th floor where you have a choice of two  glass floors to walk on.  These were better than the fake glass floor at 1 WTC.  The Koreans that were there were quite scared to go out on them and I totally freaked them out when I jumped up and down on the glass.  The 119th floor allows you to go outside and enjoy the fresh air.  There is also a place to buy your photo and a small ice cream place.  The 120th floor has a small coffee shop and there was a lounge up there as well but we didn't check that out.Not much of a wait to go back down where the elevators kindly deposit you in front of the gift shop which you must pass through in order to exit.  All in all, I really enjoyed my visit to Seoul Sky and would consider it a must do on your next trip to Seoul.", April 2017
