0,1.0,Really disappointing,"This is a few metro stops from the center of Old Seoul. Not difficult to get to on line 1 but not worth the trouble. The place is quite large but the goods are mostly of no interest, or just stuff like clothes and shoes sold in so many other places as well.", January 2020
1,3.0,Interesting but not really worth the walk from DDP,"I love a flea market, especially when in a fascinating country, but this was a bit disappointing. Lots of items far too big for hand luggage and lots of tat but little I was taken by. I particularly look for vintage clothes and fabrics and Olympic memorabilia but that was all a bit thin on the ground unfortunately.", September 2019
2,4.0,Nice Market,"I enjoyed my visit.  The goods are grouped in designated areas, but all that interested me were the antiques.  I surprisingly found several items I would buy under other circumstances.  My limitations, concerning fragile items were 2 packings and 3 flights in the coming days.  I chose not to take the chance.  To give a small indication of what can be found, while still in the market I sent several photos to a friend who collects antique clocks. His response was a big envious “wow”!As noted, I skipped most of the areas, and essentially stayed in the antiques area, plus spent some time outside where there are more vendors.  I estimate that I was there a little more than an hour and a half.", October 2019
3,4.0,Interesting to see things from decades ago,"This is like an antique market having things in the past. Good to spend 1~2 hours.- They have various items like Dongdaemun Market or Namdaemun Market. The difference is things here are old. Clothes, fashion accessories, military stuffs, musical instruments, toys, electronics, handcrafts, tools, etc.- They also have cafes and restaurants. There were some free concerts at the entrance, too.- Sellers and visitors are mostly not young. Often encountered shops with absent sellers.- Cheap things are cheap. Rare or valuable things aren't cheap. You may be able to find something awesome.- Aisles are narrow. Some musty smells. Rusty stuffs. Recommended to locals who are fed up with well-known places. I'm not sure foreign tourists will like this place.", June 2019
4,3.0,Worth a stroll,Wasn't impressed with anything here other than seeing the market in its entirety- it is huge - lines a lot of streets. There are some food stalls so you won't go hungry. There were a couple of items I liked but couldn't get them on an aeroplanes.Just an interesting thing to see., June 2019
5,5.0,Great Shopping,A real hidden gem.  Our driver suggested this place and we were not disappointed.  Some really top quality items at bargain prices enabled us to wipe out our shopping needs in one stop., May 2019
6,3.0,Interesting & fun flea market,"A nice flea market, not just housed in side the Folk Flea Market building, but also outside in all the surrounding streets. Many of the goods on sale were typical flea market things, military, new stuff, furniture, clothing etc so you really need to look carefully to find hidden treasures. Baseballs caps were piled up high on the ground and were selling for 1,000 Won each, many of them originals from baseball teams and the like. Bags were also piled up high all selling for 2,000 Won each. Old watches and watch parts were also housed in large plastic containers and boxes.We enjoyed the market but have definitely been to better such as those in Japan. However, we would happily visit this place again as it is pretty huge and stretches into many of the surrounding streets and alleys.", July 2018
7,5.0,Is exactly what it says it is - a flea market.,"We came with no presumptions other than the fact it was called a flea market, so we didn't expect to see anything in particular. We were both very pleasantly surprised to see so many film cameras from the early 1900s to mostly 1960-1980 era cameras. We marvelled at the variety of them and their charm. Definitely a must visit for any camera enthusiasts. Other than the cameras there is plenty of other old school electronics to be seen and military clothing as well as other used clothing, there is a cool Whiskey/Brandy stall too where we bought some very nice Japanese whiskey to have on a special occasion   Food court looked great too.", September 2018
8,1.0,Don't bother!,"I went here expecting a real craft experience, there was only one crafts stall. The rest was a glorified garage sale with everything was a real muddle. Only highlight was a delicious pancake at the upstairs food court. Needs better sorting and more crafts like it advertises. Disappointing place, could be so much better!", August 2018
9,3.0,Good people watching ,"Such a contrast to the shopping malls of Seoul.  Mostly vintage, aka used, clothes.  Some street food, nothing too tasty (I love street food).  Most of the stuff is of low quality and cheap.  It’s still worth a walk through.", August 2018
10,2.0,Vintage and army stuffs,"If you’re vintage collector or keen on buying army stuffs, this is definetely a must to go place. Most sellers not really good in english so make sure you sharpen up your hanguk tongue to get cheap price. Some people may see this as junk. Well, one man’s trash is another man’s treasure. Just walkinh distance from dongdaemon.", October 2017
11,2.0,Not that special,"There antique market actually includes a antique mall, stalks and street vendors (ouside the mall) that sell antiques, second hand furniture, clothing, accessories, camera, and many more.  You can find some authentic designer handbags and a lot of knock-offs.The antique mall building is the focal point of the area.  The space of the ground level is very tight and things seem to be a mess.  The second level is a lot better and stores are more organized and clean.  There is also a public washroom on the second level.We did not find anything interesting and spent just about an hour there.  No need to visit if you are not interested in these things.", October 2017
12,5.0,A great day out picking!,"Huge selection of stalls and shops with everything vintage, plus tools, clothing, shoes as well. Wander the streets, many little cafes and restaurants to take a break from shopping. Friendly people always try to help with limited english.", December 2016
13,2.0,Not worth the visit,I was there at eleven o'clock in the morning and most of the shops were not opened yet. There was an unpleasant smell in the market., February 2017
14,4.0,Antiques and secondhand.,It's a great place if you like collecting old/antique stuff. Or if you want to find something unique as decoration for your shop/cafe/room. And it's located not far from Sinseoldong station., February 2017
15,2.0,Disappointment - Just a common flea market,"Although the name is Seoul Folk Flea market, it doesn't really showcase anything Seoul or Korea. It is just a flea market selling old goods. Might be of some interest to some locals interested in antique or used items. It is not as good as the posters and banners depict as seen in the subway stations . It is easy to go as there are signs and banners showing you the direction to this market. A food court is available but many stores are closed due to lack of business.Definitely nota place for the common foreign tourists.", August 2016
16,5.0,A very neat way to experience the locals,"I am a collectible-aholic and found this place amazing!  The area is huge and you can get just about anything you want, from antiques to junktiques to collectible to second hand goods to used/new stuff, electronics, etc.  There is one main area that is in a building that has lots of ""good stuff"" but then just about every street leading to the building for many blocks around, has all kind of street vendors, locals, families selling ""stuff"" that you would never find anywhere else, easily anyways.  There are restaurants and ""main street"" shops all around.  It was very easy to get to by the subway and then you had to know where to go after getting out of the subway but I also noticed that there were signs directing to the feel market.  Pretty easy to get to and well worth the trip so that you could barter with the locals.  This concept is pretty new to them so it was great to experience it; better than the ""commercialized"" markets, which are neat in their own right, but this is just ""different"".", September 2015
17,4.0,Great place to visit on a weekend!,"The alleyways, full of professional yard/garage-salers, are great.  The prices are a bit high, but you never know what you will find.  I recommend going one weekend, just to orient yourself with all the shops in the building and in the alleys.  Then, when you have an idea of where you want to shop, go on a 2d or 3d weekend, and do some in-depth shopping and bargaining.  Beware, there is some artwork that can some nudity if you have young children (it is avoidable if you are wary).  Finally, this is a great place to find some cheap Black Yak clothing.", November 2015
18,3.0,Junk,"I'm sorry, but I'm just not into buying other peoples junk.  We went hoping to find some craft shops selling local stuff, but what we found were piles and piles of junk.  Anything you can imagine piled to the ceiling, rows and rows of it.If your looking for some battery charger for a 1970 widget, you can find it there.", September 2015
19,3.0,Go if you've been to Seoul many times,"I visited the flea market the second time I'd lived in Seoul and went there at least four times. It's nice, but not a place to visit on your first, second, or third trip to Seoul. It's a great way to blow a couple of hours in the afternoon - if you've seen all the palaces, temples, and better city markets. The flea market is quite big, and bigger on the weekend. On the weekend, there are vendors all around the building and in the streets. The quality of these goods is of dubious value. Look quickly, don't buy or pick anything up. If you don't speak the language, you could get harangued into buying something. Go inside the complex and look at the antique section on the right side of the first floor. The stuff is quite interesting and you might just pick up something you like. There are food stalls in the back that serve quite tasty treats (no western food at all - its all Korean). Walk around the other floors and you won't be disapointed. Honestly, its very similar to any flea market in America. A mix of ""one man's treasure"", knock-off clothing products, old stuff passing as treasure, and household goods being traded from one garage to another.", July 2014
20,3.0,the slow market,"if you're expecting to see attractive market or shop like crazy in this place, you'll be disappointed, obviously. but if you want to see different side of seoul--the real everyday life of seoul, then you come to the right place!  for the shopper or those loving crowd, this place will be boring, as it's only a quite small market where people buy some everyday needs--ordinary clothes, fake-branded bags, CDs, or sex toys. there's also section that offers antiques items and army goods. i love to enjoy unordinary site when traveling and feel the everyday life in a city. so i find this place is quite interessing. too bad i travelled alone and i don't speak Korean even a word--so i couldn't talk to the people,which is the most interesting part in traveling. if you have spare time in seoul, you can consider to visit this place.", November 2013
21,4.0,"A must, If you´re a real picker!","Guys,It ain´t no tourist place, with no tourist food, just everyday ordinary korean life.I loved it, I love to hunt for treasures among the junk. I would be there at least every month, if I was living in Korea.Take some time to walk around the building for there are many regular people, not business people, selling their stuff. Also, for the high rollers, there is an auction place right beside it.Go there, talk to people, get to know the culture, have fun!", November 2012
22,3.0,Nothing for tourists,"This is an inside, small market with some really nice items like old records and furniture. If you live  in Seoul you can find great things for your house, but as a tourist? There is more western style items than korean or traditional items. The food is also nothing traditional, just Korean street food.You can reach it from the Cheonggyecheon Stream. No subways are near nor nice restaurants. Across the street you will find Lotte Castle, a dragon of an apartment complex within an E-mart, cinema and a nice coffee shop.", November 2012
23,1.0,Almost a total waste of time,"I was led to believe that this was the place to come if you want vintage junk bordering on antiques.  There was very little of that here.  The entire second floor consited of rows of booths all selling the same things.  hair products in one row, bootleg cd's in another, sex toys in one, and a whole lot of garden tools.  Downstairs, there was some used clothing and one row of older items.  There were also people selling thigns outside, none of which were particularly interesting.  I LOVE flea markets, but this was quite easily the worst one I have seen in the whole world thus far.", April 2011
