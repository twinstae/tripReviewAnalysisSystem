2,4.0,"Nice building but,,,,","Cool building and layout with the station right there but the homeless folks were a little scary. Long taxi line so we decided to walk and we discovered a place called Maloney's Station right down the street. Cool place with great craft beer, we stayed there till our hotel was ready, checked in, and then went right back to Maloney's station. Good times.", February 2019
3,4.0,It is also beautifully lifted up at night,This majestic building as character compares to the new train station. Is is also beautifully lifted up at night.

5,3.0,The Former Seoul Station. Good exhibition hall.,, September 2018
6,2.0,Well... in case or rain,"Visiting this old station may have 2 goals: looking at the modern art exhibition inside or get an idea of the building architecture. The first may probably vary as exhibitions are temporary, but while I was there they were… let say it politely: not worth the detour; the second is marginally more interesting, really nothing very interesting. Both have an advantage though: they will protect you in case of rain. If sunny, enjoy the building from outside, this is its best part. Good point, entry is free", August 2018

10,4.0,"From the outside, it has neat potential as a very beautiful structure, but...","We walked by on a Monday when apparently it is closed (there was a guard on duty and we did peer behind him when he opened the door - there appeared to be some art exhibit on the main floor). It is the old Seoul train station, replaced with the modern extremely boring building next door, repurposed as some sort of cultural center. The exterior of this structure is fascinating by comparison to the new stations being in a sort of eclectic style from the 1920s - almost wish we were going to be in town for an extra day just to see if its interior has been restored to the same standard. Certainly worth checking out in a city that is fast turning into just another glass box forest.", November 2017
11,4.0,Funky art railway station ,Happened to go through the new railway station and arrived at this place. Peeked inside and took a free tour.

A good hour well spent and learnt a bit about the railway station history., October 2017
12,3.0,An Exhibit hall now,"The Cultural Station is next of the Seoul Station.  It was an old train station converted to an art exhibition hall.

15,5.0,Great art exhibit ,"Really cool historical building right next to the newer Seoul Station. When I went , they had an art exhibit about the movement of time. It was fantastic. There was a variety of types of art and they all had explanations in multiple languages. There were even some interactive parts: kids could make origami sundials and there was one exhibit where you pedal a unicycle to operate the video installation. The upper level is dedicated to the history of the station and is worth a look, too.", June 2017

Quickly took us up to the upper level, a modern train station was in front of us.  People are moving fast, everyone is busy and signs are clear to show the direction.  Stepping out the building, the city is in front of us.  Getting down to the taxi station, workers quickly guided us to the next taxi and go.", December 2015
31,4.0,Cool Building,"So I did not get inside of this place, nor did I know one could. It was just cool to see this building that looks like something one would see in Europe, only in Korea. What I wanted to  review was just Seoul Station itself and there was no option for that. What an incredible place! I love getting to the overlook of all the KRW train tracks and all the windows on the second floor. It was fun to see all the shopping there and reportedly it is one of the busiest stations in thee world, only Tokyo is busier. Something like that! The subways system in Seoul is pretty user friendly especially if you have one of the apps that has English on it. I jst had to get off and see this place!", November 2015

41,3.0,beautiful sight but sketchy area,"Tourists should note that this was perhaps the sketchiest area we travelled to - there are homeless people laying around all over the area in broad daylight (the only place I saw this in Seoul).

47,4.0,Beautiful restored and preserved,"I am not sure you will specifically go here, or that it will be on your sightseeing list, however if you are at Seoul Station, and have time you will be delighted to see the old stately structure, beautiful architecture and fancy art work.  The subway lines metro line 1, dark blue and the line 4, light blue pass thru Seoul station, so it would be easy to reach and see.  When the high speed KTX was started, and the new Seoul Station was built, this old station was turned into a museum and cultural center.  Worth a see if you have time.

51,5.0,Excellent afternoon out,"We went here on the off chance that it might be interesting and we were rewarded! There was some kind of art festival on - it was late in the day and we'd clearly missed some activities but the exhibitions were very good. The quality was mixed, as was the range of subject matter and media - including an interactive exhibition employing ipods and augmented reality to bring 2D images to life! There was a huge amount on show and we could easily have spent the whole day.", July 2013

54,5.0,Great Building...,The old Seoul Station has been converted into an art space.  The exhibit changes from time to time but the real attraction of this building is its architecture.  If you are a fan of old buildings or history there is a lot to see here.  The building has been completely restored and is open to walk all throughout.  There are numerous rooms to see.  Two of the rooms are dedicated to the history of the building itself while the rest has become a museum to show off the exhibit at the time.  The current exhibit was great although it was all modern art it didn't really fit the space but I still enjoyed my afternoon here. I've also written a more detailed entry on my blog..
