0,5.0,An Underground Shopping Street,"My friend and I went there during winter time and we bought a lot of stuff. Their coat and sweaters are very fashionable and pretty affordable well. Do expect a huge crowd during weekends, not very pleasant if you want to do some proper shopping. There sell mostly women's apparel. There are several eateries at both ends of the lanes, so not to worry if you're hungry after a whole day of shopping.", November 2019
1,4.0,Underground shopping bonanza,"A long underground stretch next to the Express Bus Terminal, easy to find. There is one shop after another, small stalls, non branded, selling everything from underwear to nights gowns. Surprisingly prices are extremely reasonable, for USD 5 onwards one can find something. It can be very crowded and noisy, not a serene shopping experience. Most shops are directed towards ladies wear, gents wouldn't find much there. It is quite iconic for Seoul though and worth a visit.", September 2019
