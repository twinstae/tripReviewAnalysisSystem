This church also holds the remains of the saints and martyrs who were sacrificed for their believes.  The structure is a stately simplistic contemporary Gothic cathedral with stain glass windows around the main altar.  It cannot be compared with older cathedrals in Europe.  It is situated on an elevated area and there are two levels of stairs to climb to reach the church.  In the evening it is most enchanting as it is lite up for evening services.

As I entered the sanctuary I could sense a peace and calm expected of a place of worship.The cathedral was completed in 1898, built in the Romanesque style, it was quite understated in my opinion compared to the European churches. It is also one of the monuments protected by the conservation law. At the time it was completed, Myeongdong Cathedral was the tallest structure in the neighbourhood and a prominent landmark in Seoul.There is a English service on Sunday morning for non Korean speakers.

49,5.0,Statuesque Amongst the Skyscrapers,"We last visited the Cathedral four years ago, in a warm summer when the streets around it, famed for their proliferation of cosmetic stores, were full to bursting and the people even seemed to have spilled over into the grounds of the cathedral.This time, in February, everything was much quieter; more serene and more fitting with the feeling of the building itself.Reading in the information leaflet - available from a stand outside the cathedral and also inside, and in a number of languages - when built, the cathedral stood high above the city and could be seen for miles.  These days of course, modern skyscrapers have rather dwarfed it, but you still get a sense that it is imposing and confident.  The church also has a considerable 'campus' around it, of medical centre, hostels etc, which mean that there is space where modernity has been unable to invade.When you consider the average time it takes to build a cathedral and then see that Myeongdong is constructed of standard brick, you have to marvel at the dedication involved in bringing this building to fruition.  It is very attractive, solidly built and looks as if it will be there for centuries to come.You can walk around the whole exterior.  Don't be put off by the main door being shut, you can gain access to the interior by one of the side doors, although this is an active church and you may be interrupting a service or prayer time.Inside the central section is roped off for those who wish to sit quietly in contemplation or prayer.  The usual stations of the cross (quite modern in design, reminiscent of Coventry Cathedral), font etc, although we didn't find the usual place where we could have lit a candle.The interior is simple and beautiful in its simplicity.Well worth a visit, whether you have a faith or not, as this is a real contrast to the bustling, busyness of the rest of the city.", February 2019

The first time occurred on a Sunday when the church was jam-packed with parishioners. Even with crowded standing-room only, people continued to enter for the service. I decided to take a closer look at the exterior and return later for a look at the interior.Dedicated in 1898, the fairly simple cathedral building stands about 76 feet high with a bell tower rising to 153 feet. The church is noted for being one of the earliest examples of Gothic Revival architecture in Korea. Its gray-and-red brick exterior retains the pure Gothic style. The structure looms on a hill above the Myeong-dong shopping district and seems to attract many tourists, based on the photos I saw being taken when I returned to explore the interior.The exterior belies the decorations within. These include arched sides aisles, stained-glass windows, religious artwork and statues. Only a handful of people were there on a weekday afternoon, looking around beneath the vaulted ceiling.A sanctuary for protestors during military rule, the cathedral has become a national symbol of democracy and human rights. I think the best photo ops occur at the entry stairway leading to the church.", October 2018

194,4.0,"In downtown, a little ""way up""","Up the stairs for about 2 to 3 minutes from the street to the entrance, this ""big all-brick"" cathedral is worth stopping by inside which you'll see beautiful patterns on the stained-glass windows (saw a painting too on a window glass), colorful figures of Jesus's disciples in a semicircle around the altar on the far end and a portrait of Pope John Paul II carved on stone (I believe he visited here); also with all the big-screen TVs mounted along the aisles, this you might call is a ""modernized"" cathedral.  Be sure to go around to the back of the cathedral too where there's a white statue of Virgin Mary and where you can light up some candles (there's a little place for that like a glass cabinet).And nearby, there's a ""pretty lively"" outdoor market area (or a Shopping Street but not a ""covered one"" with a long roof like those of Japan) with ""quite a few"" mobile kiosks for delicious-looking food items among various other things, and that market area stretches pretty close to an exit of Myeong-dong Metro Station (with more shops underground as is usually the case with pretty much all metro stations of Seoul - ""nice & vibrant"" sprawling underground spaces).Coming by subway, Myeong-dong Station (on Line 4) is where to get off followed by about a 10-minute walk north (with a few turns) to get to the bottom of the stairs leading to the Cathedral above.  You might miss the nearby market area (as mentioned above) depending on the route you take, but if you missed it on your way to the Cathedral, be sure to ""turn left"" on your way out after going back down the stairs and that will be a pretty straight way to the market.  Also, this same station is where you get off for N Seoul Tower although it's in the opposite direction as going to the Cathedral (to the south for the cable car taking you up Namsan Mountain to the Tower whereas it's to the north for the Cathedral).", June 2016

I haven't been to the masses recently but this church is one of the oldest churches around and they just renovated it since the Pope was visiting.

This is very much an active, working church,  surrounded by Presbytery and  Convent accommodation. Not overtly Catholic,  reminded me of a smaller Salisbury or Ripon.  Whilst visitors are welcome,  and  a concise leaflet is  provided in  multiple languages,  people will be using the  cathedral when  you visit for quiet reflection and  prayer,  so  a visit will be  a muted experience.
