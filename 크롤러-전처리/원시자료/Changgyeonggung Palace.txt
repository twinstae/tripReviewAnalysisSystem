0,5.0,Great Experience,This was a must see place on our Seoul sightseeing list.. Be sure to stick around for the changing of the guard. You can also take pictures of the guards and have you picture taken with them as long as you don’t touch them. Quite an experience with some fantastic photo, February 2020
1,5.0,Nice Palace,This palace in Seoul located across from City Hall plaza is very nice.  They have a palace guard program where you can sign up and be a part of a ceremony., July 2019
2,5.0,One of my favorite Palace!,This is an amazing place and we had so much fun! We have tried their tradition costume (Hanbok) and tour around the palace. A huge place to roam around and very interesting history!, November 2019
3,3.0,The gatehouse is an easy visit,"As with most Korean historical sites, this one is mostly reconstructed, but the gatehouse somehow survived fire, war and Japanese demolition orders. Easy to pop into.", November 2019
4,5.0,Peaceful Grounds,"I love its peaceful grounds, one can appreciate the beauty of this palace. The greenhouse is interesting. Less touristy than Gyeongbokgung Palace. I'm sure this palace is perfect especially in Spring time.", December 2019
5,4.0,4/5,Visited this with the Changdeokgung palace and overall was a great experience getting to understand the various structures and details in the palace grounds, November 2019
6,4.0,Another palace if you have the time ,"This palace stands next to the Changdeokgung palace and is smaller and less impressive. There is a wall separating the two palaces, with a gate. The palace gardens are vast.", April 2019
7,5.0,So interesting wandering through this Palace.,"Paid entry but guides outside offer to show you through this palace for free ,part of their further education ,these guys gave us a true history that you would not realise if you simply wandered through on your own. English names were  Bill and his Father  ,Terminator!.", November 2019
8,5.0,Beautiful palace,Very peaceful and calm atmosphere well worth the visit to this cultural historic site in the center of Seoul. The grounds are really spectacular I took a picnic and sat and people watched ., August 2019
9,5.0,Another beautiful palace,"Just as beautiful as the other palaces, but with different attractions. Greenhouse especially beautiful. The free tour was very good. A small (unmarked) side gate leads to the Secret Garden tour. It is very easy to miss.", September 2019
10,5.0,Nice gardens,"Not as popular as it's neighbour, Gyeonbokgung Palace, and on a smaller scale it is still very impressive although currently part of it is under re-construction. The lovely wooded gardens alone make a visit worthwhile especially on a sunny day in Autumn when the trees are changing colour.", October 2019
11,3.0,Not the most eye-catching of all the palaces bit worth a quick visit,Changgyeonggung is not the most beautiful of the palaces - and to be honest we only went because the gate to it was right there when we finished the Secret Garden tour - but worth a quick look round if you happen to have the palace pass., September 2019
12,4.0,Nice walks,In this complex there are some nice walks in the gardens and wooded areas.  When we went the Autumn colours were showing so it was quite pretty.  Many people dressed in traditional costume to get in free and it made the Palace like a living museum., October 2019
13,4.0,Very very very very very busy,I am giving this four stars as I believe it would have been a wonderful place to visit but there were so many people there I couldn't get near it.  I watched the changing of the guard which was slow and a little dull and I spent my time trying to figure out if they were wearing false beards but I think that says more about me than the spectacle.  Worth it if you're off-season or more patient than I, September 2019
14,3.0,"Good to visit if you have the time or particularly like gardens, not a must-see",, October 2019
15,4.0,Another Impressive Castle Built by King Sejong,"Built in the mid 15th century it was essentially destroyed by the Japanese in the 16th century, rebuilt and again and in the early 1900's the Japanese did it again. It is impressive and worthy of a visit.", September 2019

19,5.0,The palace of tragedy of Joseon dynasty.,, August 2019
20,4.0,Be prepared to walk,"The grounds were spread apart and had several steps and stairs, this is a workout. The buildings were open air and empty so you need to visualize how they were used in th roast. My favorite part was to notice the beautifully and colorfully painted ceilings,. Be sure to look up!", August 2019
21,5.0,Royal Palace,Changgyeonggung Palace is one of the 5 palaces of Seoul. Not as large or impressive as its neighbour Changdeokgung Palace but a good site to see all the same. Good examples of Josean style architecture. The gardens are particularly good and there is a greenhouse modelled on Crystal Palace. Good value at 1000KW. Entrance can be had from neighbouring Changdeokgung Palace., July 2019
22,4.0,One of the 4 palaces to see,"Changyeonggung is located just next to Changdeokgung. You can enter through either palaces and go to the other one with a purchased ticket. This palace is also under restoration. It is smaller than Changdeokgung and Gyeongbukgung and can easily be completed in less than 1 hour. Changyeonggung is included in the Royal Palace Pass. A good deal if you have enough time to visit all 4 main palaces, the Secret Garden and Jongmyo Shrine.", July 2019
23,5.0,Familiarity with Korean culture and history.,"Traditional korean architecture. The palace was partially restored after the war, but some parts, for example, roof tiles, are genuine. Very atmospheric photos are obtained.", July 2019

25,4.0,Not to miss the tranquil greenhouse and pond,, June 2019
26,4.0,Interesting and peacefull retreat,A real interesting complex consisting of several 'palaces' build in the 15th century. Good for a stroll of 1.5 hrs and to escape the buzz of the city. Very nicely maintained and the surrounding wall gives a feeling of being out of Seoul, July 2019
27,5.0,Seoul Searching,"Nice place to go for a walk while admiring the beautiful ancient structures in the grounds.  Depending on the time of your visit, there are pocket gardens that can be in full bloom.", March 2019
28,4.0,An easy stroll with serene sights,"I was not let down by this site. I generally came here for the serene gardens, walking paths, and old architecture. Along the way I learned about Korean royalty. A must see is the greenhouse here with VERY amazing bonsai.", June 2019
29,5.0,My favorite palace in Seoul,"Changgyeonggung is smaller compare to changdeokgung or Gyeongbokgung, but it has its own beauty. It is especially beautiful when it rains.

30,4.0,Small Palace in Park Like Setting,, June 2019
31,5.0,just stunning,We watched the changing of the guard ceremony which was fabulous! The uniforms and clours were amazing, April 2019
32,4.0,Must visit to see ancient Korean palace.,"If you want to go in for free, visit one of the neighboring shops to rent traditional Korean outfits. The place is huge and sprawling, the palace was maintained very well. If you plan to visit this place, make sure it is on a bright sunny day as the grounds are not paved so you will end up walking in mud if the weather is bad. So many tourists visiting the place, I suggest coming in early to avoid the crowds. Also, make sure to go towards the east entrance to watch the changing of the guards.", May 2019
33,4.0,Big palace complex,Cheap entry ticket. Nice cherry blossoms and beautiful garden still in April. Especially the view from the hill was particularly nice!, April 2019

37,5.0,Enjoyed,"The four palaces in Seoul each have unique  and intriguing histories. This palace is one of the smaller out of the four but is directly beside Changdeokgung, so one could easily spend a day visiting both. There are stairs and fair amount of walking.", April 2019
38,4.0,Very nice,I enjoyed this palace the gardens are beautiful and the grounds are not to big that you can’t do this in a few hours!!, April 2019
39,3.0,Best tried in with Changdeokgung Place,"As all the other places, just the outside of the buildings to see and all of the same decor. Be better to visit this Place when the Wildflower garden is in Bloom. Nice walk around the wooded ares. Adjacent to Changdeokgung Place with an interconnecting gate Ideal to visit both at the same time, There is a charge for both Places except for the over 65's on proof of age.", March 2019

43,5.0,Beautiful and quiet,"I visited the 4 main palaces and this one is definitely my favorite.

51,4.0,The lesser known palace,Seoul has quite a few palaces. Together with Changdeokgung this is the quieter one. From the backgate of Changdeokgung you walk seamlessy into Changgyeonggung. Because this palace was turned into a zoo during the Japanese occupation it has more open spaces., January 2019

The maple trees are particularly attractive and visitors are seen to be busy taking pictures. This year (2018), the maple leaves have turned red earlier than normal.

As described under Changdeokgung, it is accessible through a small entrance right at the front of the Secret Garden.", November 2018

69,4.0,My favorite palace,"While this is the 4th most popular palace to visit in Seoul and not the most attractive, it is my favorite due to the attractive landscaped grounds and the peacefulness.

72,5.0,A Nice Look into the Past,"Beautiful grounds and a really nice escape from the city. Hard to believe it's only 1,000 KRW to get in.  Not as touristy as the other palaces that I went too but very tranquil. Spent several hours walking around and just enjoying watching all the people dressed up.", September 2018
73,5.0,Must be my favorite.,I came here because I was in love with one picture I saw and it delivered what I was expecting. It was sunset when I came so there were only a few people. Only 4 of us I guess. It was serene and beautiful. I'm taking about the one on the other entrance by the way... near the Hongwa gate the one with the pond. I'm just glad that I went there when it was closing because I was able to take in everything and somehow reflect on my Korean journey. ;), March 2018

81,4.0,Haunted by Prince Sado,"Wanted to visit the palace as it was where Prince Sado was murdered by his father who made him climb into a rice casket where he was locked and starved to death over 8 days. His son who became King Jeongjo, one of the most revered in Joseon dynasty, moved his father's remains to hills near Suwon and built the Hwaseong fortress. We went on an English guided tour with a friend and the guide was really good. There were hardly any other people in the tour so it was almost like a private tour. The guide explained how the palace was different as it was built for Queens rather than Kings so the inner spaces occupied a larger part of the complex. She also pointed out the courtyard where Prince Sado died in the rice casket and explained that King Jeongjo is the 2nd most beloved monarch after King Sejong who created the Hangul. The palace is right next to Changdeokgung as they used to be one palace, so worth visiting at the same time as the other palace. Defo worth a visit!!", July 2018

Moreover, the compound, garden, pond, trees and the Grand Greenhouse, a conservatory built in 1909, are beautiful and calming. You will also see a large variety of  flowers and plants in the greenhouse. Worth a visit!", May 2018
87,4.0,Nice afternoon stop,This palace is adjacent to the Changdeokgung Palace. It is smaller and seems to have more green space than the other palace (if you don't count the Secret Garden). It has not been as recently painted.  There is a nice hall where you can rest out of the sun on the floor., June 2018
88,3.0,Much smaller than the palaces nearby,"I gave this palace three stars, not because it isn't worth a visit but rather because it's less interesting than its two neighbors. If you have the time I would recommend visiting all the palaces in Seoul (including Gyeonghuigung and Deoksugung). If you're limited in time I'd stick to the two major ones.", May 2018
89,5.0,Amazing architecture,"If you are a history or architecture buff, then this palace is one to visit. There are many similar around Korea, but the ones in Seoul are absolutely worth the visit.

97,3.0,Smaller version of Gyeongbokgung,"Interesting campus of ancient Korean buildings, many of which were destroyed during the Japanese invasion (late 1500s).  We spent a couple of hours there.  Not as impressive as Gyeongbokgung, but worth a visit if you have time.", January 2018

We went early morning which I felt was ideal. This is the both the oldest and most famous of Seoul's palaces, though it was destroyed and then rebuilt.

119,5.0,Interesting site,"Like all the palaces in Seoul, there's nothing actually authentic about this site. It's a modern rebuild of the palace that once stood here, that was either destroyed by fire, typhoon or the Japanese. The stories vary. There's actually not much to see other than many, many buildings. You can't visit any of them inside, only peer through the doors of the ones that are open (and there aren't many) and there's the occasional chair or throne. The grounds are very tranquil and pretty and the architecture is very interesting. You can take guided tours, offered in different languages at different times. Buy the Royal Palace Pass for W10,000 as it's a huge discount for the six sites it covers.", October 2017

126,4.0,A pleasant surprise in peaceful surrounds!,"While it is easy to get 'templed out' in a city so rich in tradition and history, Changgyeonggung Palace was a pleasant surprise...set in beautiful grounds with a feature lake and very few visitors at the time...

129,4.0,"Rich History, a Must See","As the 3rd palace to be built in Joseon Dynasty after Gyeongbokgung Palace and Changdeokgung Palace, it was originally meant to be the residence of 3 queens due to lack of kiving space at the nearby Changdeokgung. You will notice there are only a few small halls in this palace with non specific layouts. Buildings were positioned to the topography and not strictly aligned in a particular direction. Residential inner halls are bigger and more elaborate than the administration outer halls as the compound was originally intended for residential halls. A combine tour of both palaces is possible but separate ticket must be purchase. Do not miss the Secret Garden. You will need to pay a separate ticket for the Secret Garden of 5,000 Korean Won. Trust me it's so worth it. Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese guided tours are available. Changgyeonggun Palace is close every Monday. If you are taking the Subway, the nearest station in Anguk Station Line 3 and Exit 3.", July 2017

131,5.0,A tranquil palace in Seoul,"Maybe, Changgyeonggung is one of the most beautiful palaces in Seoul. It's smaller than other old palaces like Gyeongbokgung or Changdeokgung, but I could feel more peaceful mood here. I recommend to visit here on sunny days (when there's no smog!). Walk around and look around those sophisticated Hanoks, take a rest at Tongmyeongjeon (you can actually sit inside if you visit there at day), and go to  as far as two beautiful ponds. Also, you can buy night viewing tickets at the entrance if you have foreign passport. During night viewing, however, they close Tongmyeongjeon so you can't sit inside. ;(", May 2017

158,3.0,Get to a little about Korean History,"If you don't have anything to do then you should spend a half-day to walk around the palace. Basically, it is very similar to another palace in Hue, Vietnam. It is too old and it is not very clean. I guess this is because it is overcrowded with people, especially Chinese tourists. I was there and walked around with a tour guide, she was very nice, but at the end, she started crying because of the history of how the Japanese had killed their last king. I thought that was a bit over-dramatic and unnecessary. I think she was trying to convey to the Chinese tourists that China and Korea have the same enemy: Japan. The war has been over for a very long time, but with their attitude, the Koreans are still divisive.", August 2016

163,5.0,MUST VISIT especially the Secret Garden Tour,"This is a MUST visit place in Seoul. I had been to this palace 2 times and still want to go back again. To be honest, I prefer this palace even more than Gyeongbokgung Palace. Don't miss the Secret Garden tour as all the hidden gems are inside. Most of every corner in the secret garden tour are picturesque. The best season for visit (in my opinion) is fall when all the tree are red. Again, don't miss this place!!", December 2016

The participants of the tour seems not restricted to number of people per tour, so it might get a little packed. The Huwon (secret garden) is impressive with palace, lakes and leaves which makes me feel peace.

178,5.0,A must-see in autumn whilst in Seoul,"I visited the palace in late Oct. 2016 after visiting the Secret Garden of Changdeokgung. There is an entrance to Changgyeonggung right next to the Secret Garden entrance. This is very handy ie without having to go around a long way to the main entrance of Changgyeonggung. In autumn, the place is stunning with trees changing colours. There are two ponds at the rear worth visiting. The greenhouse is under renovation so I shall see it another time. The palace buildings are not so grand but the garden is great. One should see the Secret Garden of Changdeokgung and the Changgyeonggung together for a full experience of autumn palace beauty. For the former, one needs good planning ie to book the ticket 6 days in advance on internet (and you have to be quick as the bookings are all gone in 15 minutes or so, and the website is heavily jammed at those times).", October 2016

Our tour company made the reservations for the guided tour and they informed us that its difficult to get in.  Compared to the other palaces in Korea, I believe this is the best one.

I like the pond(Chundangji) and its octangonal stone pagoda. Good to take a walk around feeling serenity. Thesedays, there is special exhibition of King Jeongjo(ruling Dinasty from1777-1800).It was amazing to watch King's own writing in old Korean which is still readible and understandable even for me, contemporary human being, who live now!
