0,5.0,Must see for every visitor to Seoul,It's easy to understand why this museum is one of the top visited museums in the world. The exhibits immerse visitors into the arts of the entire history of this country. Additional exhibits show the arts of the rest of Asia. These exhibits are newly installed and are very, February 2020
1,5.0,World Class Museum!,"This museum is fantastic! I was very impressed by how rich and well-organized the museum is! The staff is wonderful! There are some robots that guide you and explain some of the most important treasures! The pieces are well-labelled. The museum is very well-curated. There are many highlights including the large pagoda in the first floor, the Sila jewellery, the pictorial work of the old tombs, the Buddha sculptures, the celadon, the porcelain, everything! The museum is free and it opens for long hours! We arrived in the afternoon. We stayed there for only 2 hours. The museum deserves at least half-day. I have to go back! We also walked around the museum. It has a sculpture garden and a beautiful lake with a pagoda.  The museum architecture is just special. Of interest, to see the sunset through the building is a memorable experience! There were very few visitors. It is a relaxing museum!It is very easy to find. You take the metro and walk a few meters from the station. The hallway that connects the metro with the museum is very interesting!", September 2019
2,5.0,A wonderful Museum....Free admission!,"I think it's awesome when a Museum offers free admission, especially to International travelers who can then learn all about a Country's Culture. My husband, son and I spent a week in Seoul, our very first trip to South Korea and visited the National Museum of Korea on our second day.It's a vast building, and one of the largest museums in Asia. We took the MRT to get there and it was a nice walk from the MRT station to the Museum. The Museum offers one hour free English language tours which we took. Our Guide was very friendly and personable and spoke English very well. There are also maps of the Museum available in English and they also detail the top sights if you have a limited amount of time to spend.I was fascinated most by the Gold Crowns and Caps, so delicate and ornate and so different from say English Crowns. :) The Museum houses many, many of Korean's National Treasures and it's really awe inspiring to get to see them and learn South Korea's history.You could spend a couple of days going through here no problem, plus there is another Museum on the grounds as well that is devoted to the Korean Language, the National Hangeul Museum.There is a large Food court area within in you get peckish and it serves really lovely meals. This is a great spot to visit if you're in Seoul. Go!!!!", January 2020
3,4.0,A well laid out tour through Korean history,"It helps if you read up on the basics of Korean history before you visit the museum, because it's a complicated story of multiple competing kingdoms rising and falling while simultaneously trying to fend off the Japanese and invaders from China. Fortunately, the museum explains this history in a series of wall boards in Korean and English. the exhibits cover everything from royal jewels to everyday life; something for everybody.", November 2019
4,5.0,An Exquisite and Informative Place.,"First of all the museum has 3 conveniently located Metro lines beneath its structure which will literally commute to and from anywhere within Seoul. The architecture as you will see in my pictures is superb and massive, very clean in the lines and overall well thought through and exquisitely designed.The day we went there was no entry fee so this was very convenient. Although overall the cultural activities in Seoul are not very expensive. Some 3.000 KW equivalent to some 3 US$ +/-.Inside the spaces are big and spacious, divided in several rooms on C shapes to be covered. Meaning: when you enter a room on the left and make a full square C, you will end up exiting the room on the far right, so this is very convenient cause the is no wrong or right in how to approach the rooms, it just flows and you cover great territory without even noticing.Some of the rooms are divided with names such as Ornaments and Art, Gojoseon and Han China, Tombs, Guardians and Deities. Also will be divided by different eras and dynasties.A room that did catch my attention and curiosity was the Furniture Room, where all the furniture was divided in Male and Female Furniture. You can see really here the differences in colors, lines, engravings and depictions on furniture that separates exquisitely both genders with style. Finally there is a coffee shop and a Gift shop conveniently located at the last floor (where you are suppose to finish). We do recommend this to everyone and definitely we had some 3 hours of pure cultural and informative fun.", January 2020
5,5.0,must visit museum,one of the best museums in Seoul.  Very easy to find get off at Ichon Subway stop on the blue line three stops from Seoul Station. the exhibits are constantly changing and they occasionally have international exhibits - I saw the hermitage exhibit and the Muesum d'Olreans Paris museum. very resasonable fees, December 2019
6,5.0,Very interesting,We went here by their hop in and hop off bus. The view is amazing and great! You will learn alot from their culture and history, November 2019
7,5.0,Outstanding museum ,"This museum is worth a visit both for the amazing building and the collections. The building is grandiose and the exhibition rooms are well designed. Everything is translated into English making it easy to navigate. The collections are remarkable, with the main focus being on Korean art from pre-historical times to early modern history. Easy access by metro. Allow enough time to visit the many interesting rooms.", January 2020
8,5.0,Tiring but worth it,"This museum is a must visit if you are a history nerd, or you're just interested in learning about our past and ancestors. It is not only about Korea as the 3rd floor is the 'world' history section where if includes historical facts and artifacts from India, rest of Asia, Egypt and Japan. Be prepared to walk a lot. There's water dispenser at every level so you can bring your bottle for refill.", January 2020
9,5.0,Free museum of Korean culture and history,"It’s close by all the palace and ancient village of Bukchon Hanok.Best of all, it’s free for all!?There is a comprehensive display and exhibits of korean history and culture and how people used to live.There were vivid and creative displays in for of real water fall and walls of Korea painting projected on walls.", January 2020
10,2.0,A bit disappointing ,"It is Korea’s National museum and it’s a nice building with a few genuine national treasures, but it falls a bit flat.  It seems too sparse and many of the English descriptions are poorly done or entirely absent.  It also does not flow well and there were only a few really memorable exhibits. The Leeum Samsung museum is much better.", November 2019
11,5.0,Interesting museum,We visited to this museum in the morning so we had a chance to catch the English speaking guided tour. It was interesting and even outside of the museum there are lots of things to explore., November 2019
12,5.0,Beautiful museum ,We came here after visiting the Korean War Museum so we were pretty tired and still very jet lagged. This is a beautiful museum and I wish we would have taken more time to explore but we were just so exhausted! Worth seeing still., December 2019
13,5.0,Very informative,This is attached to the National Museum of Korea - didn't realise it was actually two different listings.... We spent just on 2 hours here combined and didn't even do a tour (missed the english guide by 10mins).  Lots of information and plenty to explore outside., October 2019
14,5.0,One of the great museum,"Easy to get to the museum. (next to Gyeongbokkung museum)At the time I visited, there was a small number of visitors. But the permanent exhibitions were all open.The exhibitions were interested and well displayed. A good place to visit.", October 2019
15,5.0,National Museum of Korea,"In my opinion, I would place this museum in a world class category.  It is a magnificent structure that holds precious artifacts, historical documents and all else related to Korean cultural and history.  This is my second visit to this museum.  The first visit I attempted to start top down and took the free condense English tour.  I was not able to complete all floors and now several years later, I have returned and decided to start from the first level.  Needless to say, I reached up to the 3rd floor level before, I ran out of steam.  Even if you rented a translation device, it would still take you a good half of a day if not more to cover all floors.  Also they have beautiful grounds to explore and that too have a lot of artifacts around the building.  There is a good restaurant near the top level  to take a break.  So if you are into cultural and history this is definitely a museum not to be missed.  Better to break up your visit to two trips if you had the time.  Oh yes, there are some neat food trucks that you could eat just before you climb the stairway towards the museum local.", November 2019
16,5.0,Large collection of artefacts showing Korean history from pre-history to modern times.,"The National Museum of Korea is located in a park not far from Yongsan Station. During my stay the museum was very quiet with a small number of visitors. Some space was closed for preparation of a themed exposition, the permanent exhibition was all open. It is worth spending some hours here. The Museum shop has a nice collection of items at different price levels.", November 2019
17,5.0,let you guide by a guide in the Museum,"I had one day off and went to the amazing National Korean Museum , a very, very  large building which is similar to Musee d?Orsay in Paris, a lot of space. There I had a guide, it seems a lecturer from a university, he had a really broad knowledge.  Okay his English needed improvement but the explanation he gave about Korean  history was incredible.  Moreover he knows a lot of culture.The Subway or Metro  to the Museum is well organized.  In the hotel they explained me how it works  and with this information I bought  a ticket and went into Korea underground. Stations are indicated in Korean and English so it helps otherwise Korean people are very open and friendly  to show you the way . Do not throw your ticket away because at the end you get a refund of € 0,50 , very sustainable.", November 2019
18,5.0,"Great little museum, and free! ","This museum is adjacent to the Gyeongbokung Palace, so it's very convenient to visit. There's a cafe in the basement for light refreshments. A comprehensive display of the Joseon Dynasty that lasted for 5 centuries. A pleasant way to spend an afternoon.", October 2019
19,5.0,Excellent place to visit,Wonderful place to visit. Worthwhile experience. Very well explained exhibits and easy to follow explanations, October 2019
20,5.0,Very good & informative visit,"Sadly the app crashed and lost my review - good for kids- Timed, free entry for the kids museum, geared for 7 & under but no age limit.- free entry to the permanent exhibit- plenty of parking Recommend!", November 2019
21,5.0,Definitely worth a visit. FREE admission!,"One can easily spend a whole day here.  The museum is well planned and layed out.  The displays are well lit and presented with excellent information.  The main exhibition areas are free (charge for special exhibits) and there are places to eat (museum cafe and museum cafe prices).  It's just a really great museum and for the price it's a great way to spend a few hours, or to go back repeatedly (and in summer a way to beat the heat).  I used to live in Seoul and would bring people here.  I highly recommend this museum.", November 2019
22,4.0,"Interesting museum, great restaurant and affordable souvenirs",This national museum has an interesting selection of exhibits and isn't so big that you get 'gallery fatigue' when you're only halfway through. The restaurant is good for traditional Korean food at a reasonable price and I found the gifts in the museum shop were attractive and very reasonably priced., September 2019
23,5.0,A world class museum,"You can divide museums into great, and not great.  The great museums then can be divided into worth a return visit, and not worth one.  The National Museum of Korea is a great museum that is unquestionably worth return visits.First the architecture: a large building divided into smaller units (i.e. children’s museum, library, exhibition hall).  The exhibition hall has both permanent and special exhibitions.  I only had time (almost three hours) to see the permanent exhibitions on the third and second floors, but didn’t see the first floor or the special exhibition. Regretfully I left my visit to this museum for my last day in Seoul.The exhibitions themselves are of the highest quality, using, among others, collections that were donated or bequeathed to the museum.Physically the exhibition halls are impressive, massively large with high ceilings. The explanatory text is interesting and fully translated to English.There are a few places to eat.  I can only comment on the tea room on the third floor where I had an amazingly good cup of tea.  There is also an extensive museum shop which is itself impressive. I left some money there, and would have left much more had I lived in Korea and not had to take fragile things on several flights.", October 2019
24,5.0,Remarkable place to learn history of Korea,"The main building offerred free admission but don't miss special exhibitions at the library building (with extra fee which was worth the visit). I felt obliged as it was great enough to spend some money to support it. So, I bought some souvenir from the museum shop :) Easy to go there, just take a train to Ichon Station.", October 2019
25,5.0,Beautiful history ,We visited the museum while staying in Seoul. It is very well laid out and the displays are simply beautiful.  Amazing that so much history has been preserved and acquired for people to see.Was particularly pleased to see so many school groups there., October 2019
26,5.0,Thoroughly recommended,So impressive how the museum is organised - you almost feel how it was like to live in ancient times.  Need at least a day to do it justice......, October 2019
27,5.0,A Beautiful Way to Spend an Entire Afternoon.,"My wife and I spent a lovely afternoon browsing through both the paid exhibitions (""The Etruscans-Rising to Rome"" and ""Through the Eyes of Joseon Painters"") and the first couple of floors of their free exhibitions.The hours just went by as we strolled through the many galleries, admiring the exhibitions.During my visit, as I was going through the ""The Etruscans - Rising to Rome"" exhibition, 3 boys were left on pretty much on their own and they were running around the exhibition, being a general annoyance. A poor female exhibition staff had a hard time trying to stop those 3 imps. This brings me to my one pro-tip: If you are bringing your kids, and I highly recommend that you do (there is even a children museum), keep them on a tight leash.Anyhow, the museum (inside and outside) is splendid. Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time to cover (or at least walk through) all its exhibitions.", October 2019
28,5.0,Ideal place for ones who love to learn about history and culture,The national museum is a must-visit when you are in a country. This is big so you need about 2 or 3 hours to discover., September 2019
29,4.0,A nice museum,"This museum has many different Korean artifacts and artworks. The first floor focuses on pre-modern and early-modern history in Korea (though no modern history section). The second floor focuses on calligraphy and artworks, while the third floor is mostly porcelain pots. I would have liked to see more history, especially of the modern period, but overall the museum has quite a lot of artifacts and is very extensive. The museum is free to enter and can be accessed via the Ichon subway stop. Worth checking out if you are in Seoul.", October 2019
30,5.0,Amazing museum,"This museum was amazing, the building itself is beautiful and there are many interesting exhibits, which helped us to learn more about Korean history. Lots of information in English, and very useful leaflets guiding visitors to key exhibits.", October 2019
31,5.0,All about korean,"Puré culture, learning experience for all of us, bisedes, an special exhibition from europe, estrucos Was there", October 2019
32,5.0,History of Korea Before your Eyes,"If you have time, you should go to the museum.  You can walk through the history of Korea, and depending on what's being shown, travelling items can be seen as well.They had the ""landscape"" painting exhibit when we went.  They were also showing the Etruscan stuff - which we bypassed.New modern museum, layout of which reminded me of D'Orsay.  It also has a food court to keep you from wandering off too far in search of food.  Food actually passable as good, and are reasonably priced.  Museum items was well worth the time spent, and is highly recommended.", September 2019
33,5.0,Great for a rainy day,The museum is quite big and have many interesting exhibitions. Recommended for a family trip or for a rainy day., November 2018
34,5.0,A must see in Seoul,"A great place for museum lovers or those with a genuine interest in Korean history. The museum is housed in an imposing building surrounded by beautiful grounds. Entry is free to the permanent exhibitions. We were fortunate to arrive on a day where there was free entry to the visiting special Etruscan exhibition. Very easy to get to via the Metro, Ichon station, Line 4, exit 2 has a special pathway to the Museum itself. Well worth a visit, you could spend hours here.", October 2019
35,5.0,Beautiful Museum,"Spent 4-5 hours here on a rainy day on my most recent trip to Seoul and still did not cover the entire museum. It's a beautiful space and highly recommend spending a half day (or more if you can) exploring. The grounds around the museum are beautiful as well, wish it had not been raining so I could've spent more time exploring the complex around the museum.", September 2019
36,5.0,Museum ,Great museum and best of all it's free! Extensive Asian collection. They even have little robots for help if needed. Worth a day no matter the weather!, September 2019
37,5.0,Excellent,Really impressive building with a wonderful and accessible collection. Could spend a few hours or days there!, September 2019
38,5.0,This Museum is not boring,"Well organized, nice exhibition in a vibrant building. It is not ovecrowded even on a rainy day. Free entry is a plus.", October 2019
39,5.0,Beautiful Museum,"Easy to access from metro line 4 (Ichon station exit 2) or bus (#502 or #400) this museum is well worth the visit.  General entry is free (M/Tu/Th/F 1000-1800, Wed/Sat 1000-2100, Sun/Holidays 1000-1900 - closed Jan 1, Seollal, and Chuseok) and they offer guided tours in Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and English throughout the day.  Exhibitions are displayed over three floors - a variety of galleries - prehistoric works, celadon, an impressive Iron Buddha - just amazing works.  Worth a quick visit if that is all you have time for or one could spend hours just admiring the works.  There is a nice gift shop, several options for tea or meals, and a children's museum on site (did not visit).  I would highly recommend a visit to this amazing museum - can be combined with a visit to the National Hangeul museum and Yongsan park for a short stroll outside.  Ichon is becoming a more developed neighborhood with plenty of places to eat or get coffee and about 1/2 a kilometer from the metro stop to the Hangang Riverside Park and paved trail that runs seemingly endlessly along the Han.", September 2019
40,5.0,Truly world class,"I'm truly surprised by the number of museums and galleries in Seoul. The National Museum of Korea is a gem and a must see.  The building is large an spacious with exhibited being well laid out. I've only managed to see less than 30% before it closed. I will be back again. I loved how they present history and culture. Korea, whilst smaller than China, is in her own right a very sophisticated country and unique in many ways. The gift shop is the best and biggest I've seen for a museum.", September 2019
41,4.0,Excellent museum,"We needed more time to take in all the history and artifacts this museum has to offer. We were not given long enough to take it all in, but learned a lot in the time we had.Definitely worth a visit.", September 2019
42,5.0,Worthwhile for History Buffs!,"You could probably spend an entire day here, if not more! This is one of the biggest museums I've ever visited, but it's beautiful. It's very well curated as well. Keep in mind that unless Korean and Asian history is something of interest to you, this may not be your thing. As interesting as it is, it may be difficult follow along and grasp all the history that's being thrown at you. Nevertheless, if you just want to look at beautifully preserved artifacts, then this place is perfect for you. I remember walking into one room with a VAST collection of Buddha and Bodhisattva statues, I believe mostly from Korea, and they were just breathtaking. Absolutely enormous, with fine detail and descriptions nearby.", May 2019
43,4.0,nice museum with interesting historical exhibits,nice museum with interesting historical exhibits.. nice to visit and learn about the past of this culture but also because of the cultural open air events, September 2019
44,4.0,A nice Museum,"If, like myself  you are not a great lover of large rambling 19th Century Museums, crammed with thousands of artefacts over umpteen floors and galleries , this is one for you!It's modern, it's light, it's airy and is just one long building with just 3 levels with a very ""constrained"" number of exhibits covering some quite precise subject areas. Entrance to the main collection is free.A little word of warning, in busy times the galleries are quite manageable, but don't be tempted to try the food hall!", August 2019
45,4.0,Nice place with good AC,"It was a muggy day when we visited as it’s been raining on and off. As part of the tour, we went through it within an hour. Could easily spend half a day if you’re into history and artifacts", September 2019
46,5.0,Will require some interest in historical art,"If you are into understanding and experiencing the evolution of Art, calligraphy and sculpting, this is a must do.If not, you’d better skip it.Very detailed collections of multiple era’s within the Korean geography. Surprisingly well kept. Especially the calligraphy from stone carving over papyrus to the first printed books.The museum souvenir store is a real gem.", September 2019
47,4.0,Simply awesome,"This museum is big, and I mean big. There is so much to see within its walls that make sure you reserve more than one hour if you really want to focus on all of it.Sadly, as in every museum in Korea, Korean nationalism has embellished some of the history and left the nasty parts out.", April 2019
48,5.0,Fabulous story of Korea,We love to visit National Museums when we have the opportunity. With only 2 days in Seoul we had to choose carefully how to spend our time. We are so happy that we began our first day at the National Museum of Korea. The displays were nicely presented with narrative in English which gave us insights and information to better understand Korea and the Korean people. This large and airy museum includes a 10 story pagoda. The directional flow from room to room is logical and easy to follow. Our 3 hour visit was fabulous. We highly recommend making the time to visit this excellent museum., August 2019
49,5.0,cultural icons,"For history and historical art lovers. A huge collection of Korean sculpture, furniture, calligraphy, painting.... impossible to see all in 1 day.", July 2019
50,4.0,A look back in time,We love to learn about the countries we visit and the museum was a great way to do that. It feels wide open and uncluttered and is easy to get around. The gardens outside are beautiful and not to be missed. We didn’t eat here as it seemed expensive (like all museums) so bring snacks. My 12 year old was bored but my two 18 year olds love it. Have a great day., June 2019
51,5.0,A Random Walk Through the Korean Ages,"There are three great cultures in East Asia: Chinese, Korean, and Japanese.  For at least the last two millennia, Chinese cultural influences radiated out to both Korea and (via Korea) to Japan.  Westerners sometimes dismiss Korean art as imitative, but that’s not true.  You might as well dismiss Italian Renaissance painting as simply imitative of Flemish, or Romanesque architecture as simply imitative of Roman.  Each of the Far Eastern national arts is unique, and excellent.  But I suspect even those with a strong interest in art and culture are far more familiar with Chinese and Japanese than Korean.  So in terms of delving into artistic and cultural terra incognita, we Westerners would get more bang for the buck in the National Museum of Korea, than in either the Imperial Palace Museum in Taipei or the National Museum in Tokyo.  All three of these museums are overwhelming, but Korea’s fine arts are the ones most likely to be a terra nova.  You could spend a full day at this museum, standing in line when the doors open and being ordered out when they close, and still not absorb it all.  I was astonished to see TA’s suggested duration as “2 to 3 hours” but felt better when I checked and saw their suggested duration for the British Museum was also “2 to 3 hours.”  In fact: cheer up, curators of the NMK: TA’s suggested duration for the Louvre is “< 1 hour”!  The curatorship of the NMK, by the way, is as outstanding as its collection: which was good news for me: I needed all the help I could get.  Here are just a few things I’d recommend you look for:Plug ‘Em and Pot ‘Em:  We do a lot of odd things to our dead.  Egyptians mummified them; so did Chileans.  Zoroastrians put them out for the buzzards to eat; so did Thais long ago.  Eating them was the norm in New Guinea, New Zealand, and the Amazon.  But as you wander through the NMK’s collection of Three Kingdoms artifacts (4th~5th century C.E.), be on the lookout for some huge red clay pots.  Baekje honoured their noblest dead by jarring them.  My mother used to preserve stuff in jars too, but it was apples and apricots, not ancestors. (See Burial Jars photo).A Really Old Boat: The best-known boat surviving from antiquity is the Khufu boat, which has an entire museum to itself, a baseball’s throw from the Sphinx in Gaza.  It’s over 4000 years old and remarkably well-preserved, but was built strictly for mortuary purposes and never even got wet.  The NMK’s got a real boat that’s twice as old: 8,000, not 4,000.  You get to see what little remains of it, and a recreation.  A humble canoe; no Pharaoh would have dreamed of stepping into it, but it would be thousands of years later before Pharaohs were even invented.  I’m not sure we’d even gotten to antiquity yet when some stone-age Korean carved this canoe: Korean fauna back then included cave lions and woolly mammoths.   I suspect the canoe hit a rock, got holed, and was abandoned by its owner as a now-worthless piece of junk.  Little did he know that people would line up and pay good money to see it 8,000 years later (see Neolithic Canoe photo).Buddhas Explained: Naturally the NMK has a large collection of ancient Buddhas.  I’ve mentioned the NMK’s outstanding curatorship.  I particularly commend them here.  I’ve been to national museums in China, Japan, and every country in Southeast Asia, and this is the first museum I’ve seen seen that explains each and every mudra.  Whether they’re giant Buddhas or miniatures, all Buddhas do something with their hands.  Each hand gesture has a specific meaning, but if you don’t know  Buddhist sign-language, you can’t read them.  The NMK provides you with an easy 10-minute course on what each one of them means, immeasurably improving your understanding and appreciation of what you’re seeing.  After six years of wandering around Asia, I knew a few of them, but now I know five times more.  A healing Buddha holds a medicine ball in his left hand, and not only heals folks, but saves them from calamities (in both Pure Land or Theraveda Buddhism, the “goddess of mercy,” Guanyin, does the same, and she also holds a bottle of medicine: see Healing Buddha).  A different gesture indicates that the Buddha is dividing his disciples into nine different grades, depending on their religious capacity (see Grade-Making Buddha).  The star of the collection, however, is a pensive Bodhisattva, one of the National Treasures of Korea (see Pensive Bodhisattva).  The museum’s also got a brilliant 5-minute video on the building of one of the UNESCO world heritage site Buddhist temples in south Korea, broken capstone and all.  Every NMK video is worth watching.Other National Treasures: Korea has an admirable system for identifying its finest cultural treasures.  You’ll find quite a few of them in this museum.  National Treasure 61 (NT 61) is a 12th century dragon-shaped celadon ewer (see Celadon Dragon); NT 191 is a golden “antler helmet” and girdle (see Antler and Girdle).  Other NTs run the gamut from NT86, a towering ceramic pagoda that you can’t possibly miss (see Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda) to NT 89, a belt buckle that you could easily miss, but hopefully won’t:  it’s made of over 50 grams of pure gold thread and granules, shaped into a large twisting dragon surrounded by half a dozen smaller ones (see Gold Belt Buckle).  I used to have a belt buckle just like that myself: in my dreams!  Be on the lookout for anything in the museum with an NT designation!I could have spent several days in this museum.  Spending only one, I focused almost entirely on the Korean collections.  However, the museum has important collections from other cultures, including Gandhara and Pala.  Two items that definitely caught my eye were a bronze Greek helmet and a small but ornate Malay basin: small because it was used to give new-born babies their first scrub (see Greek Helmet and Malay Neonate Basin).  If you’ve an interest in Chinese celadon, don’t miss the the Sinon Shipwreck Collection.  This not-quite-hardy-enough ancient freighter was headed to Japan in the 1320s, ran afoul of a typhoon or faulty navigation, and wound up at the bottom of the sea off the coast of Korea.  1323 was at the tail-end of the Mongol dynasty (they went through seven emperors during that decade, each one worse that his predecessor), but China was still making first-rate china.  Hence, a treasure-trove of Chinese celadon from as far afield as Canton: being glazed, thousands of pieces were in pristine condition.  Personally I’d rate Sung celadon #1, T’ang porcelain #2 and Ming #3, but a ship-full of any Chinese celadon is a treasure-trove indeed, with a thousand pieces of metalware as a little something extra (see Sinon 1, Sinon 2, Sinon 3 and Sinon 4 photos).If you want to take a break, the museum has both a excellent tea-house and a restaurant.  Be aware that if you order anything with “spicy” in its name, such as “spicy beef soup with black tiger’s paw mushrooms” it may be hotter-than-Hades spicy even by South Louisiana Cajun standards (see Spicy photo).  Also note that the grounds around the museum are well-worth a stroll, with bridges and pavilions, gardens and carp ponds (see Museum Gardens photo).  As with any other major world museum, what you bring to it will reflect what you take away from it.  If you can do the Louvre in under an hour, 2 or 3 hours here will certainly suffice.  If you’ve got young children, the odds are that that hall after hall of glazed porcelain will make their eyes glaze over.  But for visitors with a real interest in Asian culture and art, I’d recommend getting there when the doors open, and sticking to it until they close.  But then, I’d recommend spending a whole day at the Louvre, too.", August 2019
52,5.0,National Museum of Korea,Nice place to explore! This large area with many historical things is great for knowing better korean history., July 2019
53,5.0,Very impressive museum building,"We had allowed a few hours to look around but you could easily spend a day in here if you wanted to take in every exhibit in the permanent exhibition and then the rest of the complex. There are three floors in the permanent exhibit and we ended up having to skip the entirety of the third due to time. Looking at the guide map there is also a Children’s Museum on the other side of the entrance auditorium, so definitely allow more time if you’re travelling with younger kids. The permanent exhibit is free although there is a charge for the rotating special exhibitions and Children's Museum. If you are spending a day there’s plenty of restaurants and cafes on site. We also passed a 7-eleven or similar store in the complex.

54,5.0,A great overview of Korean history,"If you love museums and history, this is the place to go to. The place is new, massive, and has a great collection of Korean history.

55,5.0,Best layout of museums,We always go to the museum of the country we visit and this one was particularly good. The layout was amazing and seamless from one period to another. The space between exhibits were large so you won't feel crowded at all. There were plenty to see and read. We arrived 1 hour before closing as we rushed over from another museum. So we only did the ground floor and chose the important parts to see. The museum is free to enter for all. You can download the museum app and use it as an audio guide. You need to use your own headphones though as required by the museum., July 2019

58,5.0,Lovely museum full of interesting history.,"I'm not sure if it's free for everyone, but it was free for us as part of the tour and it was a decent hour or so we spent in there. Very interesting to learn about the creation of the Korean writing system and more about Korean history that I didn't know. Useful going into my PhD in East Asian Studies.", July 2019
59,5.0,National Gem Not To Be Missed,If time allows only one museum choose this one. Its free and hours vary depending on the day of the week. Look online at the official website. Skip the guided tour. English hard to understand and 1 hour spent on 10 items. Allow 3 hours plus time for any special exhibits. Download the app and bring your earphones.

60,2.0,Dont bother if you dont have extra time,"Building itself is impressive. Exhibition boring and way too large, feels like you have seen these same green vases so many time. Seems to be popular amoung school groups. Children running around and acoustics make place noisy .", July 2019

There is quite a great view of the N Seoul Tower from there and they have shops where you can buy souvenirs related to the antiques that you will see in the museum. I went to the museum on the weekend and I didn't have to pay an entrance fee, I guess the entrance is free on the weekends. You are allowed to take pictures of the different exhibition rooms they have but you are going to be requested to go through an X-ray security checkpoint before entering the hall where the exhibition rooms are. I highly recommend you to go to this museum if you are interested in the history of Korea and of course if you are willing to spend two to three hours there because the museum is huge.", June 2019

68,5.0,A must visit.,"If you are visiting Seoul, there are three places that is must in my opinion. Gyeounbokgung palace, National Museum of Korea, and The War Memorial of Korea are the three, The first two will provide visitors with the sense of Korean culture, history, and the language that is unique to Korea. The last will give you an insight into the recent history of the nation that overcame the tragic and catastrophic events that were Japanese occupation, liberation, and Korean War.", July 2019
69,5.0,"It’s free and has a beautiful, large park!","It may not be quite as interesting as the War Museum (the best free museum in Korea), but it does get the silver medal. Great way to spend a few hours out of the sun or rain and when the weather is right, enjoy the large park outside. In fact the park is superb... mini-rivers and waterfalls, play area for kids, lots of green space and trees - great way to relax. Highly recommended... a very cheap day out!", July 2019

(Something hard to find in Korea.) As a resident of Korea, I love that this museum gets special exhibits (like the ""Golden Man"" from Kazakhstan last year) and that it has a great selection of coffee and tea shops and a beautiful sitting area on the second floor. It's a spacious, beautiful museum and a world-class collection--for free!", June 2019

77,5.0,Just fantastic,We are great fans of museums. This being said this Seoul museum is at the top of the pile. We usually. Is it from the top down ( fewer people do the upper ranges) and only completed the 2nd and 3rd floors in 3 hours.Th displays are well thought. Our highlight of a 7 stay in Seoul., June 2019
78,5.0,Spectacularly beautiful museum,"Was able to spend two hours here and wished we could have stayed all day. Not only are the exhibits fascinating, but the building itself is very beautiful. The architecture is modern and sleek, but not in a brutalist unfriendly way. The lighting inside the building was amazing, and the fixture are very technologically advanced. One of the most beautiful museums I have ever visited. There is a restaurant and children's museum there as well.", June 2019
79,4.0,So Much History For One Day,"The National Palace Museum was housed in a massive building and was quite impressive as we walked towards it.  The opening in the center framed a view of Seoul Tower in the distance.Outside in the sprawling park were various ancient lanterns, restaurants, a bell and a large pond.  Inside were three floors of historical artifacts both curated and donated to the museum.  We started on the third floor and worked our way down with the hopes of missing the large groups of school age children that arrived the same time as us.  This worked well for the first hour.  The third floor contained a large variety of Buddhist sculptures and various pieces of art from around Asia.   Half of the second floor was full of donated collections and were a mixture of different eras and countries.  Not that interesting to us.  The other half covered the paintings and an amazing two story tall Buddhist scroll.  Dynasties and even older Korean civilizations were covered in detail on the first floor.  However, as this was a rather large museum we breezed through these displays as we were ready to get outdoors.  Overall, this museum could be split into a 2 day visit to avoid history overload.", June 2019
80,4.0,"Impressive building, interesting collections",It's a 40 minutes ride on the subway south from Insadong including a 10 minute underground walk from the stop to the main entrance.

81,4.0,Early Morning Stroll,"I took an early morning subway ride to this place knowing that the Museum has an expansive grounds to stroll.  Arrived 9AM and had a leisurely stroll around.  Note that there are people jogging and they have small trails winding around pagodas and meditation nooks.  It was so peaceful without the crowd and by noon it was already hot.  The museum entrance is free and they have two special exhibits.  The exhibits costs KW7500 and for people who has not much interest on it, I recommend you pass.  The main museum artifacts are more than enough for a short visit (approx. 1 hr).  There is a convenience store open prior to 10AM and I saw two restaurants that were still close when I left the grounds.  I suggest coming early to avoid bus loads of kids visiting the museum.", May 2019
82,4.0,I really enjoyed this museum,"This is a great museum. 1) its free 2) the grounds are beautiful 3) the museum store has very inexpensive and nice museum gifts 4) lockers for your stuff 5) many nice artifacts from Korea and other Asian areas. We did not go to any of the special exhibits as we were a bit short on time, but we had a great visit.", May 2019
83,2.0,Staid and underwhelming ,"Possitives : N o doubt the museum's contemporary architecture is both modern and impressive and is set in very attractive gardens. The facilities are very adequate, there is free entry and the staff are pleasant and helpful.  Negative: For such a modern, national museum....Boy, it was so tediously boring. Old school type of exhibition...just dated exhibits and artifacts in glass cabinets. No interactive fun here or anything to fuel the imagination . I fell asleep on my feet my the second floor. I should imagine incredibly boring for children .", May 2019
84,5.0,Extensive Exhibit of Asian Artifacts,"The museum is easily accessibly via the Seoul Metro. The grounds are beautiful with several restaurants and many places to sit and relax. There was no admission charge but there were charges for some special exhibits.This is a large museum and is well laid out with exhibits down the side of the main hallway on each floor. There is just too much to go into extreme detail but there is coverage of Indian, Chinese and Korean history and artifacts; all well presented and explained with many explanations in English for those like myself that had trouble with Hangul.My favourite was probably the ancient shipwreck exhibit which showed many artifacts.There were several souvenir shops. The restaurant Was very good. Reasonable price for a museum restaurant; the Bibimap (meat and vegetables mixed up with rice) was quite tasty.definitely worth a visit.", May 2019
85,4.0,Good way to know some Koran Culture,"It is a bit surprising that there are many artifacts are relating to Buddhism including the multimedia shown how a marvelous shrine was shaped without a nail in ancient time. The engineering in their past few hundreds years ago was astonishing. It made me feel closed to Asia and proud of them.I visited the special exhibition about Five Hundred Arahants. The display was breathtaking, virtually an exceptional artistic arrangement. In that space, You felt like you were among them in that comfortable quiet space when the statues all had different expressions unique in each. It bestows you the sense of content and serene, a surreal feelings is very hard to describe. The acoustic arrangement with Arahants statues in other display room just amazing. It satisfied you not only the eyes, but ears, to be exact, even mind! When I left the room, I feel enlightened. :-)After all, there are lots to see, although quite lots of them purchased in few centuries ago. Properly this is one of the reasons why we should visit the National Museum of Korea,  not to mentioned the well designed building and surrounding.", May 2019
86,3.0,Concrete over nature,"We were not able to enter the museum because we used up all our time playing outside and around the place. Although the building shouts CONCRETE, the setting is serene with nice pocket spots.  There were pine trees that dropped lots of miniature pine cones that my little granddaughter enjoyed collecting - this is why we ended up staying outside.", May 2019

88,5.0,Wonderful Museum!,"We spent about 2 hours at the museum, though you can easily spend a lot more time. We did not do the audio tour, but we did do a guide tour (in English) that lasted about an hour and highlighted some of the National Treasures in the museum.  The guide spoke very good English and was very knowledgeable.  We definitely recommend doing a guided tour if you can arrange to visit when they are available.  The guided tour, like the rest of the museum, is free.  Be  sure to save time to explore the beautiful grounds outside the museum as well.  If you are doing the free guided tour, then I would say give yourself 2 hours minimum at the museum, though we could have spent more time there if we had more time to spare.", March 2019

91,3.0,wonderful architecture,"The National Museum of Korea has a great amount of exhibits about the korean history. Even though the museum is free of charge and offers an app to get english explanations about some of the exhibits on your one cell phone not everything is explained. If you are not very familiar with korean history you'll easily get bored. But the place is worth s visit just because of the beautiful landscape, the architecture and the view of the N. Seoul Tower from the south.", May 2019
92,5.0,Great Place in Seoul,"This was a great, free, way to spend a few hours while in Seoul. Easy access from the subway.

94,5.0,This museum shows the high respect South Koreans have for their history,"From the elegant building itself to the depth of the collections to the attention to guest comfort - this is a world class museum.  The displays (all with English signage) provide a sampler of the history and culture of South Korea.  There are several places to eat both inside the museum and outside but on the museum grounds. Each floor has a couple sets of rest rooms, and places to sit and rest. As for getting there, subway access is easy; from the maps I saw, I was concerned we might have to walk across a large parking lot to get from the subway to the museum, but not so; there is a direct underground tunnel from the subway to the museum entrance plaza; although some walking is involved, it's comfortable and quiet.", April 2019

100,2.0,It’s free for a reason ,"The museum is in a wonderful modern complex with a huge building housing some artefacts from various ages. I’ll be honest, I like a museum  but this one didn’t do it for me. I felt they struggled to fill it and what they had was interesting but nothing special.", April 2019
101,4.0,Large Museum ,Took advantage of the free English speaking guide. She was knowledgeable and interesting but had an extremely soft voice so it was difficult to hear. Lovely building and interesting exhibits. Easy to get to on the Metro and well worth a visit., April 2019
102,5.0,Good for a picnic as well,"The museum with the most heritages in Korea.With amazing flower gardens and huge pond, it's good for a picnic as well as history learning.- As everyone knows, the entrance is free except special exhibitions.- I was surprise to see it opens seven days a week.- The varieties of items weren't as much as I expected. But, it's still huge.- Don't expect much of luxurious and fascinating treasures because former Korean kingdoms have valued something humble. On the other hand, there are delicate and mysterious master-made items. - The location is quite away from popular touristic areas. It's not crowded on weekdays.- Exhibition halls are well-maintained. You can watch most items just by moving forward. And there are quite enough resting areas.- Free lockers, coffee shops, restaurants, etc. Souvenir shop is must-visit. There are amazing merchandises.- In April, there were many maehwa(Japanese Apricot flowers) blooming in the garden. It seemed there were more people outdoors than inside. Taking a walk around the building is recommended when it's warm.- To the east, it's connected to Hangul Museum and Yongsan Family Park. Both are good to visit as well.", April 2019

They will help you download an App with a description of most of the exhibits and if you have your passport or drivers licence with you, they will loan you ear plugs. Then it’s off for a wander.  We thought the Museum shops were reasonably priced and far better quality than the tourist stuff for sale in Seoul generally.

The admission is free but some exhibits are charged. This is the place if you want to learn more about Korean history.", March 2019
118,5.0,Absolutely Stunning,"The building housing the National Museum of Korea is, quite simply, stunning; it is worth visiting the museum just to admire the architecture alone - a wonderful example of modern design fitting perfectly into it's environment.Entry to the permanent exhibitions of the museum is free and brief guides are provided in a number of languages.Across the concourse from the permanent exhibition halls is that used for Special Exhibitions, for which there is a charge.  We didn't visit the special exhibition.Within the permanent exhibitions there really is too much to take in on one visit and so we decided to concentrate on ceramics and pottery.  In a nutshell, the First Floor covers Prehistory and Ancient History, Medieval and Modern History; the Second Floor exhibits Calligraphy and Painting and Donated Works and the Third Floor, Sculpture and Crafts and Asian Art.Exhibition halls are spacious, high ceilinged and well laid out.  The areas flow into each other and sometimes there is a 'lounge' off the hall.  There were lots of school parties there when we visited and there was plenty of space for the children to sit on the floor with their leaders and discuss what they had seen.  The space here is enormous, it's hard to describe.There are at least two museum shops - good quality souvenirs, notebooks etc and one shop concentrating on offering discounts on items from previous exhibitions.There are good toilet facilities on each floor and a number of places in which to eat and drink.  We relaxed at the Tea Rooms, enjoying a delicious ginger tea.Given more time, I think we might have taken an English language tour - there are six per day, four in the morning and two in the afternoon.  The museum has a good website, so am sure that details could be found there.After you have finished in the museum, take a wander through the grounds until you come to the Pagoda Garden, worth a look.We thoroughly enjoyed our visit, it felt like a real privilege to see it and share in it.  We would thoroughly recommend a visit.", February 2019
119,5.0,Very well documented history of Korea,"The Korean history over the last 3000 years was very well documented and displayed at the museum.I was very impressed with the spirits of Koreans over the millennias, overcoming various adversities and human calamities! It’s adoption of Confucianism was critical for the development of the Korean Empire over the centuries. I was very surprised that the last dynasty of Korea lasted for more than 900 years, much longer than any dynasties in China the longest of which was about 500 yearsThe museum is also conveniently located near metro station.A must visit for all visitors who want to get a sense of the historical importance of Korea.", March 2019

121,4.0,Try the Pagoda Restaurant while at the Museum,"We ended our visit on a Thursday (late night at the Museum) at the Pagoda restaurant.  My friends all opted for the  prix fixe menus (Korean and Italian) and thoroughly enjoyed.  I decided on something different, the octopus bibimbop - and thoroughly enjoyed. It was more like a deconstructed bibimbop  with the rice on the side, to be added.  A really good variation on a traditional dish", February 2019

123,5.0,very comprehensive summary of korea's history,"The museum is very complete and modern, the exhibits in the first floor where specially appealing to me since I love history it shows a very detailed history of korea from prehistory to the modern times.  The museum is small and may not have a whole lot of pieces in display, but mind you that for a country that has been looted and pillaged various times through the centuries, the museum collections gives a very complete image of the korean nation, highly recommend if you have the time", February 2019
124,4.0,"Amazing building, mediocre exhibition","Im gonna start of by saying that these sorts of museums are often not something I enjoy that much.With that said, I did not think the content of the exhibitions were that interesting. There was definitely some cool things on display. But also, it felt for me like 50% was different pots and porcelain. Which some might find interesting, but quickly gets incredibly dull in my opinion.But what really saves this place in my eyes is the building itself. Which is enormous and, I think, incredible both on the inside and outside with surrounding.Also, the museum is for free. So if interested, I definitely recommend going here and if you find the pots as dull as I did, atleast you will have the building to look at.Additionally, I did not take any tours. Audio nor guided, so maybe that would have enhanced the experience.", February 2019

136,5.0,Definitely a must visit!,"First of all it’s easily located at the entrance of the train station exit. Probably a 5min walk once u exit the train barrier to the exit.Secondly it’s free of charge. There is no fees and you get 3 stories of viewing. Probably taking you about 2hrs to complete finish walking and looking through all the displays. However not all the explanation for the displays are in English. At the basement there is an activity for the kids to trace & colour king Sejong face which could keep the kids occupied for awhile. The facility is very clean, neat and nice.

The focus is on Korean art but there are also strong exhibits with Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Cambodian, East Indian, Lao, Thai, Indonesian, Mongolian and Filipino art as well.  Admission is free.  If you go on a weekday in the morning you will likely encounter bus loads of school children in the museum.  So if you prefer a more quiet visit you may want to go on a weekend or in the afternoon (the kids seemed to be getting tired after around 2pm).  Guided tours are available.  I eavesdropped on a few different tours and they were extremely informative.", November 2018

The art section on the first floor enhances the awe factor and very mesmerizing! The displays are well-arranged and flows very nicely in alignment with history. Right from the 3- kingdom period to the Unified Silla, Goryeo to Joseon dynasties. The section on Joseon Dynasty will leave one with wonder and intrigue: it's a one-stop destination to learn about the interlinked history of Korea, China and Japan in the early Medieval and Medieval period. It's so enlightening to know that Korea has richer and older culture compared to contemporary Japanese culture. Must visit place in Seoul!", June 2018

The admission fee of the special exhibitions are around 6000, but the permanent exhibitions are free of charge, and they are worthwhile enough to visit.  You can see well-organized artifacts of Korea throughout the history. There are also many precious artifacts from other areas, such as China, Southeast Asia, and West Asia. And the special exhibitions are of even better experience. We visited the the Joseon Dynasty Maps exhibition, which showed the history of Korean people making maps of Korea and even the whole world. The exhibition is very well-organized with many technological designs. You could scan the code to see the AR effects of the map with your mobile phone. Many local people found the places they were familiar with in the ancient map. The visitors were really having fun!", October 2018

152,5.0,Plan to spend the day,"This place is amazing, i went twice, each time spending 3 hours looking around and i still didn't see the whole museum. More than just a building with great artifacts you can also walk the ground that have a waterfall and genuine 1000yr old statues. Even if museums are not your thing, the view alone is worth the trip. TIP: they are open until 9 on Wednesday and you can see Namsan tower from the top of the museums steps", October 2018

Lots of other cultural possessions inside from China, Mongolia, Rome, Japan to name a few. Very popular spot for schools and you'll see lots of children and their teachers all over. Overall it wasn't as impressive as I thought. The War Museum is a better choice with more ""interaction"".", August 2018

161,5.0,Museum,Great museum to spend time in. It has interesting exhibits to look at and we could spend hours in there., July 2018
162,4.0,Beautiful museum with really interesting exhibits,"This museum was on our list to visit while we were in Seoul and we were so glad we did. It was easy to get to by local bus which stops right opposite the main entrance. The building is stunning and beautifully designed, spacious and filled with natural light, and the gardens and mirror pool are equally impressive. We were too early for autumn colour but the trees should be even more beautiful in a couple of weeks.The museum is free so it was busy with many groups of schoolchildren visiting on the day we went. But there are 3 floors with many exhibition rooms so it’s easy to avoid the crowds. The exhibits include periods of Korean history from prehistory to the Korean empire and sections covering traditional Korean crafts. There are also sections covering Asian art from China, Japan, Central Asia and India. It’s easy to spend a couple of hours here. We also had a wander around the lovely gardens. There is also a small food court and a shop.Well worth a visit.", October 2018
163,5.0,Pleasant Surprise ,"During our visit, a special outdoor exhibition of traditional dance and music was preformed at the outdoor amphitheater, which was an unexpected added attraction to a very interesting museum. Two special exhibits plus the museum’s 3 floors of Korean art and artifacts kept us busy for several hours.", October 2018
164,5.0,If it is not on your bucket list it should be,"For once I found myself with a day to enjoy whilst on a business trip to Seoul. Usually imy visits comprise of the traditional airport, taxi, hotel, taxi, meeting, taxi cycle.Braving the immaculate Seoul underground helpful locals and clear signage meant I arrived without misadventure. Simply look to connect with the light blue line 4 and get of at Ichon, the covered walkway is well signposted and brings you into the beautifully manicured park surrounding the impressive museum.Entry to the main museum is free, but you do have to pay a nominal amount for special exhibit halls. The ground floor is laid out chronologically with exhibits starting from from Neolithic times all the way through to the modern day. I recommend you spend some time studying the timeline mounted on the wall at the entrance, particularly if like myself, you have limited knowledge of Korean history. The exhibits are beautifully presented and most have a good English language explanation. I am not sure how long I spent wandering from era to era, probably about three hours, but I was so immersed it didn't really matter. With hindsight I should have done some background reading as my head was struggling to piece all the information together. Second floor was focussed on art and ceramics with the third floor furniture and similar. First / ground floor requires the most time.There are cafes on each floor but are limited to mainly cake and coffee. There is a food hall but it was a little too busy so I gave it a miss. Spent thirty minutes sitting in the sun before walking around the mirror lake to visit the National Hangeul Museum. This is an absolute must if you want to piece together some of what you have seen in the main museum.Great day out, free entry too and an awful lot of new knowledge to be fascinated by", October 2018
165,4.0,The highlights tour of the museum was very good,"My husband and I visited this museum on a cool raw day and enjoyed the free tour in English of the collections highlights (we were the only ones at 10am.) Our tour guide was hard to understand but was a Korean history major, so he knew a great deal about the pieces he was showing us and Korean history in general.  The stone pagoda, golden tiaras/belts and the pottery at the end are beautiful. The Museum gift shop was one of the best we found in Seoul, very reasonable prices, esp. the postcard set of 25 for $10. The reflective glass makes it hard to take good photos of some items. Compared to other Seoul attractions, the museum is quiet and spacious (built less than 25 years ago.)", October 2018
166,5.0,WOW!!,I loved going to museum when going to difference places. I learnt alot of news things when visiting museums. There are alot of exhibition showing in October. I remembered there was exhibition on Joseon dynasty. Very educational for my brother and I., October 2018
167,5.0,Fascinating museum,"We visited on a chilly, foggy, autumn morning which was the perfect kind of day for a museum visit. The museum is huge but is surrounded by gardens which are worth exploring. On entering you are immediately taken by the ceiling's design and the architectural simplicity of the exhibition halls off from the main rectangular atrium which has exhibits along its length. We spent a lovely couple of hours observing the many exhibits, my favourite being the rooms containing a variety of buddhas from across Asia. Definitely worth a visit, especially on a grey day, especially as its free.If you are heading elsewhere afterwards by bus, have a look for the shelter of memories, which is a bus stop on the main road outside with tile memories (in Korean) embedded among the bricks - quirky - I just wish I knew what they said!", November 2017

An absolute must when in Seoul.", September 2017
192,3.0,Lovely Architecture Of The Museum But The Exhibits Can Be Better,"The design of the museum is lovely. However, the exhibits can be much improved.

If it is NOT a warm day, you can spend time siting in the grounds as well. If you have the time, you can spend the full day here.

207,4.0,Hidden Gem,"There is not much hype on the Museum so we did not plan to visit it at all.  In fact, it was only because it was located directly opposite the palace and we had some time before our appointment with our guide, that we decided to pop in for a look.  Entry is free.  There are lockers that require coins to rent but the coins are returned after you unlock the lockers.What we saw was mostly the history of Korea; the opinions on how it came to be, how it developed and so on.  It was very interesting.  Cater about 2-3 hours.  We rushed through it in less than 1 hour and regretted that we did not have more time to spend there.", August 2017

The museum was worth the visit, every corner was well maintained and every item was well taken care off. You will surely need to visit it for yourself.

Even my 10 year old was enjoying it!", June 2018
214,5.0,A great introduction to Korean History,"This museum was very well laid out with the ground floor dedicated to the history of Korea up until the early 20th century.

216,4.0,"Beautiful museum, but needs more filling out","This museum is my favorite museum in Seoul, with a vast array of artifacts ranging from ancient times to the era of the Korean War. The museum is educational for learning about the history of Korea, something which is mostly ignored in Western education. Many of the rooms are not filled to capacity, but the museum is spread out enough that there is plenty to see. The top floor has exhibits on Asian history in general, encompassing more than just Korea--I found these more interesting. There is also a large quantity of pottery and calligraphy throughout the museum. Admission is free, and while an audio guide is recommended, I found it cumbersome and unnecessary. Many of the items have English labels and an English map is available.", March 2018
217,4.0,Download of korea history (till the formation of korea),"The museum offers a decent download of the history of Korea, till the formation of modern Korea. Sadly you wouldn't get to see anything like the impact of World War. Alot of stuff are touch and go, but that is understandable because Seoul also hosts many other related museum such as the National Palace Museum of Korea. As an arsent museum goer, it is just a pity that this museum is not a ""one stop shop"".The key exhibits are in the first floor. The 2nd and 3rd floors houses some arts pieces of Korea and artifacts of the world respectively. I personally think that you may give these 2 upper floors a miss it time is a constraint - I can see effort in the curation, but the collection, especially on general world, is quite thin.

219,5.0,truly world-class,"i can tell you from extensive travel experience that this museum is a work of wonder.  the architecture, organization, presentation and landscape already make it a great place to visit and adding to the fact that it showcases the best of Korea for FREE is a great way to learn and appreciate Korean history/culture", June 2018
220,5.0,"A treat, worth visiting","The architecture is great, the way the rooms and lighting (both natural and electric) really highlight the art.There is enough on display that everyone should find something interesting, i was delighted to see the cultural influences of surrounding countries as that aspect is often skipped.I would recommend a visit.", June 2018
221,5.0,Such a great museum - World class,"We enjoyed this peaceful, amazing architecture and all of the many wonders within.  You can see so many different periods of Korean history here.  From the famous ""Turtle Boats"" of the 10th century through the Korean War and beyond.  A balance focus on events and culture.  Really a treat.", May 2018
222,4.0,A very good option when visiting Seoul,"Subway Line 4 will take you there. Just follow the sign and then walk along the long corridor, you will soon reach the museum.Very spacious and the environment is quite good. Quite true, it’s a bit cool in the sense that there are not too many people and the space itself is quite overwhelming.Good collection on Buddhist paintings and sculptures. Must see.Some nice restaurants. Good for spending a few hours there. This is my second time visiting the museum. Think I’ll still go back.", June 2018
223,1.0,Huge disappointment,"We were so looking forward to seeing Danwon and Hyewon paintings in this museum. It was easy to take matro line 4 to get there. Walking through air conditioned tunnel, we thought it is a great design to avoid the sun light. The museum campus is quite big, well maintained and free admission. We asked front desk where are the paintings displayed. The answer is ""they are in the storage room, not in exhibit. We don't know when they will be shown"".", June 2018
224,4.0,Huge museum ,"Massive museum that is worth a visit - mainly Korean objects but some Asian (particularly Chinese) as well. Plenty of English explanatory notes, and videos and the apps are nice supplements.  Layout is reasonably good, and one can easily spend half a day there. Admission is free but tickets needed for special exhibitions. Not many visitors, and somehow the museum seems to be a bit ‘cold’ and not very engaging.", June 2018
225,4.0,Not a must-do but not bad,It's big museum with an extensive collection of archeological finds and art. Furthermore it's free. There is only limited information on the more recent developments in Korea for which the History Museum of Seoul is a better choice., May 2018
226,4.0,"Free, many exhibits, best for the history buffs","The National Museum of Korea is connected to the Ichon Station (Line 4) and a comfortable walk both to the museum and within the museum. While it is a big location with multiple artefacts to keep you occupied, I will first warn that most of the permanent exhibits are of art and archaeological digs, making the museum cover more about what Korea was hundreds/thousands of years ago more so than what South Korea is now. If that is what you want to see, then the Museum is a great place to be in, otherwise I suggest you take the time to explore Seoul's other museums/districts which would talk more about people's present lives.Otherwise, its free and an appropriate location for wet weather. There are also special exhibitions you can pay for and the National Hangeul Museum in close vicinity so you can easily spend a few hours here.", May 2018
227,5.0,Nice and free!,"Travelers are always looking for interesting and stuffs, and this is one of them. You will learn a lot of Korean culture and helps to understand their traditions. The only inconvenient was the restaurant, which didn´t sell me a coffee and a cake, they ask me to have a complete meal to get the service.", July 2017
228,2.0,Not much to see,"There is not much too see compare with other museum in Seoul. Don't think there is value to visit if you have not much time in Korea,", April 2018
229,5.0,National History,This massively impressive building in Seoul is home to a lot of South Korea's History. The building is made up of three floors and is spilt into a number of different chambers dependent on time periods of various kingdoms/empires including the Japanese colonisation period. There is however a lot of information so I would recommend either spilting your visit into a number of hours with a break in the middle or possibly a couple of day's. There is also a museum shop with lots of different gifts and also a cafe and a large exhibition/amphitheatre area just outside the building where they play music and perform. And best of all its free and easy to get to by subway or bus., May 2018
230,3.0,Good but general,"If you got your history classes in high school (EU students), then most of the information obtained here is repetitive. Nevertheless, it does generally specify on Korea. I would recommend the war museum whocj gives the same information but more specified on their own korean history.", May 2018
231,4.0,Nicely organized,This is a nicely organized museum. Exhibition is arranged according to chronilogical order. Going through the exhibit halls and rooms taught me a lot about the history of Korea. I may be wrong but the artifacts often looked like recent replicas., May 2018
232,5.0,Huge fairly new museum.,Built in this location in 2005.   It’s huge.    So easy to get to from the #4 Metro.    Signs in the Metro pointing to the Museum.   We took the free docent tour.   Took about 1:20.   Lots of information on the tour.   There is a huge breath to the museum.   We particularly liked the celadon pottery on the 3rd floor as well as the smaller Buddha statues.    Several restaurants and a food court., May 2018
233,4.0,A worthwhile visit,This museum is a cultural asset of Korea. It shows the sequence of ancient Korea to modern Korea. It is a grand building .Entrance is free but special exhibitions were paid for.  Senior citizens get special discount. Wheel chairs are available. Different exhibits are displayed on different floors. Sculptors on one paintings and calligraphy on another.The first floor had historical exhibits. The routes were marked and therefore very easy to follow. The escalators were small and very cute.  The souvenir shops had lovely attractive things and we were able to buy things to take home for friends and family The property had lovely gardens with colourful flowers and on going down a few stairs there was a big water body around which people were taking walks and some chilling on benches. I wish I could have spent more time here, May 2018
234,5.0,Very impressive building,"Went on a solo trip to this place as the wife had another appointment and it was totally worth it.The outdoor areas were beautiful and well designed. The building architecture too was impressive.Going in, you do not need to pay for an entry ticket (however I believe that the special exibhitions are paid events)The first floor narrates the entire history of Korea, starting from the stone age period to the korea empire. Second and third floors belong to art and sculptures. I learnt so much from the artifacts and exibhits on display. I now have a working knowledge of Korean history. The first floor exibhits are structured in a chronological order, so if you follow the recommended route, you will not miss a part of Korean history. Only managed to complete the first level though due to time, but would love a return visit for the other floors if possible.", May 2018
235,5.0,"Worth the stop, even just to stroll around outside","I saw very cool pictures of this futuristic place so definitely wanted to go and check it out. The building looks really cool and there was a market right outside it and also down below, very cool vibe and lots of fancy art installations around the museum. We didn't go inside as we are not so interested in museums, but it is definitely worth while just strolling around the place. Totally recommend it!", April 2018
236,5.0,A First-Rate Museum of Korean History and Art,"Three friends and I visited the National Museum of Korea after spending about a week studying the Korean War, and we all walked away really glad we spent most of our day here. After covering Korean history from 1949-1953, roughly, we felt like we had a much better understanding of Korean history as a whole, and loved the range and depth that the exhibits here offered. I know the artwork was also worth seeing, but I confess that we were ""museum-ed out"" by the point we hit the art (we spent about 3 hours going through the history exhibits on the first floor alone) that we more or less strolled through, stopping only at the works that really caught our eye. One could easily spend a few hours or a day here and it would be well worth it.", March 2018
237,3.0,There are better options,"If you don't read Korean and are not familiar with Korean history, this is going to be complicated. I walked through it but it wasn't engaging for me.", April 2018

240,5.0,Tremendous ,"On returning to Seoul from a few days in the country we headed here for 2-3 hours before returning the hire car. The place is vast so we didn't do it full justice, but it is stuffed worth Korean treasures from across the agesProfessionally presented, well laid out,  there is a follow through route marked on the floor. And it is freeThis is a world class museum", April 2018
241,3.0,A somewhat sterile historical museum,"Mostly artifacts. A nice, big space but not too interesting. Would have liked to see more art. Don't expect to spend much time here unless you have a keen interest in Korean artifacts.", April 2018
242,5.0,Do Not Miss!,"A world-class museum that has free admission and something for everyone.  The grounds themselves of this massive building are impressive enough and offer photo ops aplenty.  Once inside, I recommend renting an audio guide device at the front desk so that you can get more information on demand about any exhibits or items you find particularly interesting.  It's only 1,000 Won.There are usually concerts of some kind happening every Saturday afternoon, which I was lucky enough to catch from the upstairs balcony of the cafe on the second floor just above the stage in the entry atrium.The building itself is a bit of an architectural marvel inside and out as icing on the cake!", April 2018
243,5.0,This is one of my top museums in the world!,"Wow!  How can we capture our full response to this beautifully designed museum?  Offering a vibrant span of Korean history, plus mesmerizing art and artifacts, we easily could have spent another couple of hours reading the well-written signs and descriptions about the diversity of Korea and beyond.  Pretty amazing to see art displayed through antiquity and modernity, with technology offering enlightening new ways to enjoy their stories and masterpieces.The collections were exquisite and the cultural Renaissance happening in Korea is inspiring.  How amazing to get to be a witness to the transformation.  The visit to the National Museum of Korea informed the rest of our trip around the peninsula.", March 2018
244,4.0,Decent amount of information and displays,"This is my 3rd time here and I still enjoy it. However, I note that the exhibits hasn't changed much over the years. We didn't understand the English guide much but because he was so sincere, it would have been terrible to fault him.", April 2018
245,5.0,important visit,"we went to the museum for a visit. we pre registered for an hour and a half tour. they have yours in several languages. it was excellent.  without this you just wonder around and it's too big. it gets you to the right points.  so my suggestion us,to do this your and if you want to stay, you can,stay longer.", April 2018
246,5.0,A beautiful place to walk around,"The museum was very nice and I enjoyed their collection of potter, and the restaurant inside had a good variety of choices, but I loved this museum for its extensive grounds. We wandered all over the park area and enjoyed the playground, walking trails, pagodas, and lake. I almost didn't want to go inside. We were there in the spring and the cherry trees were in full bloom, but it would be beautiful in any season.", April 2018
247,4.0,Worth the visit,"We visited during a national holiday so there was not charge. This is a really great museum to visit if you are interested in war history.  It has a floor dedicated to all the historical wars that Korea has been a part of, and then a floor for the Korean - American war.  This is fascinating, and certainly carries the Korean perspective on the war.  Wish we had more time there.", February 2018
248,5.0,Good exhibit and it is free1,Museum has quite a collection of the emperors' history with beautiful drawings of emperors' parades and how they lived.

249,5.0,One of my favourite places to visit,A great place to learn about the Korean history. The English guide was very knowledgeable and I had a great time. The museum restaurant on the ground floor was lovely with great service., March 2018
250,5.0,A MUST. Some Amazing History,"I was truly touched by the heart and soul of the Korean people. The past hundred years of Korea, has been a blind side of history to me. I was given a free book on the History of the Korean War. “Korean War 1129”. Amazing how many countries came to the aid of Korea, what War actually does to a nation, what an oppressive regime can do, and what Freedom does for the soul and a country.", May 2017
251,5.0,Very interesting ,I enjoyed this museum.The building is huge and modern in a nice surrounding area.There are two main exhibition halls. One with a permanent exhibition about the history of Korea through different artefacts and another one with temporary exhibitions. The main gallery is free admission. If you enjoy history and looking at different artefacts you can spend a few hours there. I went on my own on a Sunday morning and I spent around three hours. There are spaces for you to sit down and rest your legs. There are also some cafeterias and museum shoppings. Throughout the building.I sincerely recommend., April 2018
252,5.0,Too big for tired tourists but still very good,"That was our last day in South Korea, and our last day of the long vacation. So, we were a bit exhausted, and the museum  building is so big. It’s amazing, the architecture, and the collection.", December 2017

257,5.0,"Beautiful, calm, huge!",I spent nearly a whole day at this museum.  It is such a beautiful space.  I felt calm and meditative within it.  LOVED the special exhibition of the tiger in east Asian Art.  It is the 9th largest museum in the world and I can't wait to go back and explore it all the more.OH...and the majority of the museum is FREE.  You'll have to pay between $3 and $6 for special exhibitions., February 2018
258,4.0,National Museum of Korea and Fabulous Park,"Extraordinarily beautiful architectural building with views to Namsan Hill. The park within the Museum is really beautiful, though our visit was in the dead of winter, i could image how beautiful it would be in other seasons - some of the trees have their botanic names.  Highly recommmended for a visit, if not just for the park grounds. Comprehensive presentation of Korean history and artifacts, and some in the park also.", February 2018

260,5.0,Worth visiting!,"For those who want to understand more on Korean culture, everything is excellent in the National Museum of Korea, including the exhibition, souvenir shop, cafe and the attractive musical performance.

264,5.0,"Big museum, free of charge","National Museum was one of the big museum that we ever visited, and need more than 2 hours to look every exhibition inside it. Just like any other national museums, it had the exhibitions about past time. But they displayed all the artifacts in good arrangement. Besides that, they also had Korean culture exhibition. To reach this museum, just take mrt to Ichon Station and follow the directions. It's free of charge. If you come with kids, we suggest you to also visit Children museum.", February 2018
265,4.0,"Beautifully done, but a ton of pottery","I was hoping for more history and less pots. The museum itself is massive and beautiful. I found it hard to get into despite the great job they have done with the artifacts in the museum. I did like the furniture exhibit. The rest I wasn't much impressed by besides the massive pagoda. Maybe I was just too tired to appreciate the museum, but it was worth going at night to see the view of the N Seoul Tower", February 2018
266,5.0,Excellent Museum ,This beautiful museum is definitely worth your time. The long history of Korean civilization is beautiful presented and the exhibits have English explanations so no need for a tour. The main museum is free and there is a charge for special exhibits. It’s set in beautiful grounds and near a subway stop., February 2018
267,5.0,Well Worth It!,"Free admission at a first class museum. All the donated collections on the second floor made the visit extra special. The donated collections often contain hundreds of items from a particular collectors area of interest. We were amazed at the generosity of the Korean donors and interested by the unique items that Japanese collectors had actually returned to Korea. Sometimes in museums, when items are arranged by time period and isolated, smaller items seem to lose their beauty. We were impressed that Korean collectors saved so many items from their respective areas of collecting, even though the nation has endured such hardships since its independence. Love the building and grounds. Didn't have time to get to the special exhibitions but this place is worthy of a second day visit.  We were happy to see art in Korean everyday items like furniture, money, and even sewing items.", February 2018
268,4.0,More Korean?,"I was expecting that they would have more Korean things on exhibition (or was I in the wrong museum??). Ground floor was all about the Korea, which is very informative. But the 2nd to 3rd floor, is disappointing. I don't get the connection of the items on exhibit. It's like since the pieces were donated by famous people (I get it..), so they throw all those bits and pieces together? But the interior and exterior architecture made up for the disappointment. The museum is child, elderly and Instagram friendly.", February 2018
269,5.0,Insightful,An insightful look into the development of Korea over the ages. Admission is free for the main hall. Worth a visit., February 2018

There is also a separate museum for children.  It has English,Japanese, and Chinese tours you need to check how many a day. Subway line 4 will take ypu there. Is really beautiful and has 4 floors that you will enjoy a lot, be sure to have time that day is so many little details in some of the exhibitions.", November 2017
271,5.0,Amazing museum. ,"Go!  I mean it. All the museums in South Korea were amazing and I went to at least 15 of them. This museum is very well done with English explanations and a free English audio guide (you must leave an ID to borrow the guides so bring your drivers license). While there were no children in my group, I saw lots of groups of children and they had plenty of activities and ways to keep them interested. This museum really helped me to understand the history of Korea and its culture. We spent at least 3 hours in the museum, it just depends on your pace.  I would highly recommend going to the National Museum of Korea.", January 2018
272,4.0,Impressive but not real exciting,"The museum building is world class, and was the most interesting part about our visit.  The museum is very well organized, with a helpful layout that makes it easy to walk from room to room.  Lots of different types of Buddhas and history of the country (Japan rule, Buddhism, ancient tools, pottery, weaponry, etc.)  As a foreigner in South Korea, I could not fully appreciate the expansive rooms of rock weapons, excavated pottery and the ceramic vase exhibition.  There are fire extinguishers everywhere; from one spot I could physically see eleven fire extinguishers.  At the restaurant we had a western-style salad and an octopus rice dish; both were very good and reasonably priced.", January 2018

274,5.0,"Great museum, easy to navigate, excellent exhibition layout in super contemporary well-thought-out building","The museum is huge. You can easily spend 4-5 hours there. It is a new building, very contemporary looking, with a lot of daylight coming in, escalators everywhere, marble floors - simply great. There is a plenty of restrooms, multiple coffee shops, few large museum shops, a storage place to lock your bag or coat. I wanted to get on the English guided tour, which is free, the first one after the museum opening time. I ended up being the only one on the tour. It was only me and a tour guide - call it 'a private tour' :-) The tour took around 1 hour covering a few main artifacts on the first and second floors. I enjoyed it. I also enjoyed perfectly brewed cappuccino in the coffee shop :-)5 stars, highly recommended.", November 2017
275,5.0,You'll Learn Alot!,I went on a quiet weekday and arrived in time to go on one of the free English guided tour of the museum.

Free lockers are also nice to stow your coat, bags, etc. Korea is so low on crime I even leave my purse in the locker without worry. Very interesting displays and art. Not a lot in English, as with most museums in Seoul. But this museum is one of my favorite Seoul museums.", November 2017
280,3.0,Good for Korean history,"The museum is huge, I'm not sure you can see everything in one day. This is great if you are interested in Korean history. I personally wouldn't bring kids here as it can get a bit boring.There is a lot of pottery and the colors are bland, so if you are tired from your travels don't go there, it will put you to sleep, but overall art and history lovers will like it.", August 2017
281,5.0,Great and rich museum,"This is a big museum with several floors and a large exhibition of artifacts from the different Korean history and dynasties, such as statues, paintings, ceramics, calligraphy, etc.The museum is free and family-friendly, as there were many families and tours with kids when we visited on a Saturday, still it didn't feel crowded.", December 2017

286,5.0,Huge and free,This place was our last stop of our Seoul visit. I found it convenient because not only was the entrance free but it was actually worth your time. It's a three storey building with many rooms to enlightened yourself on South Korea's history and culture. Allocate 2 hours of your time because 1 hour isn't enough time to cover the area., December 2017

289,3.0,"Great Building, But Seems Empty","The best bit is the building itself - as another reviewer wrote ""a museum of space"".  It is simply cavernous, and worth a visit in itself.  Like most Korean museums it's also free.  But where are the contents?The ground floor contains the findings of numerous tomb digs - well-preserved and beautifully presented.  My favourite object was a Roman glass jug: think on how that got to Korea 2000 years ago, but sit down first as your mind will begin to spin on what something that fragile had to go through to survive the trip.Upstairs are numerous collections of ceramics: most donated and of really high quality and, again, beautifully displayed.The down side is that, unless ceramics really are a core interest of you this museum doesn't have much to see.  Sorry, but it's even a bit dull.  I visited several museums during my visit and, I fear, they have spread the jam too thin", November 2017
290,4.0,Pleasant experience,"I visited the museum without much expectations as I just wanted to escape the cold but boy, what a find!

There is very low lighting throughout which may be an issue for anyone with poor vision....The museum itself is a very modern contemporary building that oozes quality.In summary this is a jewel in the crown of museums and one you certainly would not want to miss, first class.
