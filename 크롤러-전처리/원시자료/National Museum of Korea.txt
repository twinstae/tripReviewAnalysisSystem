3,4.0,A well laid out tour through Korean history,"It helps if you read up on the basics of Korean history before you visit the museum, because it's a complicated story of multiple competing kingdoms rising and falling while simultaneously trying to fend off the Japanese and invaders from China. Fortunately, the museum explains this history in a series of wall boards in Korean and English. the exhibits cover everything from royal jewels to everyday life; something for everybody.", November 2019

7,5.0,Outstanding museum ,"This museum is worth a visit both for the amazing building and the collections. The building is grandiose and the exhibition rooms are well designed. Everything is translated into English making it easy to navigate. The collections are remarkable, with the main focus being on Korean art from pre-historical times to early modern history. Easy access by metro. Allow enough time to visit the many interesting rooms.", January 2020
8,5.0,Tiring but worth it,"This museum is a must visit if you are a history nerd, or you're just interested in learning about our past and ancestors. It is not only about Korea as the 3rd floor is the 'world' history section where if includes historical facts and artifacts from India, rest of Asia, Egypt and Japan. Be prepared to walk a lot. There's water dispenser at every level so you can bring your bottle for refill.", January 2020

10,2.0,A bit disappointing ,"It is Korea’s National museum and it’s a nice building with a few genuine national treasures, but it falls a bit flat.  It seems too sparse and many of the English descriptions are poorly done or entirely absent.  It also does not flow well and there were only a few really memorable exhibits. The Leeum Samsung museum is much better.", November 2019
11,5.0,Interesting museum,We visited to this museum in the morning so we had a chance to catch the English speaking guided tour. It was interesting and even outside of the museum there are lots of things to explore., November 2019

15,5.0,National Museum of Korea,"In my opinion, I would place this museum in a world class category.  It is a magnificent structure that holds precious artifacts, historical documents and all else related to Korean cultural and history.  This is my second visit to this museum.  The first visit I attempted to start top down and took the free condense English tour.  I was not able to complete all floors and now several years later, I have returned and decided to start from the first level.  Needless to say, I reached up to the 3rd floor level before, I ran out of steam.  Even if you rented a translation device, it would still take you a good half of a day if not more to cover all floors.  Also they have beautiful grounds to explore and that too have a lot of artifacts around the building.  There is a good restaurant near the top level  to take a break.  So if you are into cultural and history this is definitely a museum not to be missed.  Better to break up your visit to two trips if you had the time.  Oh yes, there are some neat food trucks that you could eat just before you climb the stairway towards the museum local.", November 2019
16,5.0,Large collection of artefacts showing Korean history from pre-history to modern times.,"The National Museum of Korea is located in a park not far from Yongsan Station. During my stay the museum was very quiet with a small number of visitors. Some space was closed for preparation of a themed exposition, the permanent exhibition was all open. It is worth spending some hours here. The Museum shop has a nice collection of items at different price levels.", November 2019

The displays are well lit and presented with excellent information.  The main exhibition areas are free (charge for special exhibits) and there are places to eat (museum cafe and museum cafe prices).  It's just a really great museum and for the price it's a great way to spend a few hours, or to go back repeatedly (and in summer a way to beat the heat).  I used to live in Seoul and would bring people here.  I highly recommend this museum.", November 2019
22,4.0,"Interesting museum, great restaurant and affordable souvenirs",This national museum has an interesting selection of exhibits and isn't so big that you get 'gallery fatigue' when you're only halfway through.

29,4.0,A nice museum,"This museum has many different Korean artifacts and artworks. The first floor focuses on pre-modern and early-modern history in Korea (though no modern history section). The second floor focuses on calligraphy and artworks, while the third floor is mostly porcelain pots. I would have liked to see more history, especially of the modern period, but overall the museum has quite a lot of artifacts and is very extensive. The museum is free to enter and can be accessed via the Ichon subway stop. Worth checking out if you are in Seoul.", October 2019

Entry is free to the permanent exhibitions. We were fortunate to arrive on a day where there was free entry to the visiting special Etruscan exhibition. Very easy to get to via the Metro, Ichon station, Line 4, exit 2 has a special pathway to the Museum itself. Well worth a visit, you could spend hours here.", October 2019
35,5.0,Beautiful Museum,"Spent 4-5 hours here on a rainy day on my most recent trip to Seoul and still did not cover the entire museum. It's a beautiful space and highly recommend spending a half day (or more if you can) exploring. The grounds around the museum are beautiful as well, wish it had not been raining so I could've spent more time exploring the complex around the museum.", September 2019

Exhibitions are displayed over three floors - a variety of galleries - prehistoric works, celadon, an impressive Iron Buddha - just amazing works.  Worth a quick visit if that is all you have time for or one could spend hours just admiring the works.  There is a nice gift shop, several options for tea or meals, and a children's museum on site (did not visit).  I would highly recommend a visit to this amazing museum - can be combined with a visit to the National Hangeul museum and Yongsan park for a short stroll outside.  Ichon is becoming a more developed neighborhood with plenty of places to eat or get coffee and about 1/2 a kilometer from the metro stop to the Hangang Riverside Park and paved trail that runs seemingly endlessly along the Han.", September 2019
40,5.0,Truly world class,"I'm truly surprised by the number of museums and galleries in Seoul. The National Museum of Korea is a gem and a must see.  The building is large an spacious with exhibited being well laid out. I've only managed to see less than 30% before it closed. I will be back again. I loved how they present history and culture. Korea, whilst smaller than China, is in her own right a very sophisticated country and unique in many ways. The gift shop is the best and biggest I've seen for a museum.", September 2019

48,5.0,Fabulous story of Korea,We love to visit National Museums when we have the opportunity. With only 2 days in Seoul we had to choose carefully how to spend our time. We are so happy that we began our first day at the National Museum of Korea. The displays were nicely presented with narrative in English which gave us insights and information to better understand Korea and the Korean people. This large and airy museum includes a 10 story pagoda. The directional flow from room to room is logical and easy to follow. Our 3 hour visit was fabulous. We highly recommend making the time to visit this excellent museum., August 2019

The gardens outside are beautiful and not to be missed. We didn’t eat here as it seemed expensive (like all museums) so bring snacks. My 12 year old was bored but my two 18 year olds love it.

54,5.0,A great overview of Korean history,"If you love museums and history, this is the place to go to. The place is new, massive, and has a great collection of Korean history. There are highlights of the collection, as it will probably take you more than a day to go through in detail through the entire collection. Highly recommended museum!", August 2019
55,5.0,Best layout of museums,We always go to the museum of the country we visit and this one was particularly good. The layout was amazing and seamless from one period to another. The space between exhibits were large so you won't feel crowded at all. There were plenty to see and read. We arrived 1 hour before closing as we rushed over from another museum. So we only did the ground floor and chose the important parts to see. The museum is free to enter for all. You can download the museum app and use it as an audio guide. You need to use your own headphones though as required by the museum., July 2019

57,5.0,Book several hours for this museum ,"Very interesting museum. Tons of information and details. Great place to learn more about Korean history.

In addition there is an amazing space in front of the entrance, or rather between the entrances. With a beautiful view to Namsan (sp?). See the photo.", August 2019
58,5.0,Lovely museum full of interesting history.,"I'm not sure if it's free for everyone, but it was free for us as part of the tour and it was a decent hour or so we spent in there. Very interesting to learn about the creation of the Korean writing system and more about Korean history that I didn't know. Useful going into my PhD in East Asian Studies.", July 2019
59,5.0,National Gem Not To Be Missed,If time allows only one museum choose this one. Its free and hours vary depending on the day of the week. Look online at the official website. Skip the guided tour. English hard to understand and 1 hour spent on 10 items. Allow 3 hours plus time for any special exhibits. Download the app and bring your earphones. Well organized so numbered exhibits correspond to numbers on the app. Exhibits in English so easy to follow. Enjoy!, August 2019

There is quite a great view of the N Seoul Tower from there and they have shops where you can buy souvenirs related to the antiques that you will see in the museum. I went to the museum on the weekend and I didn't have to pay an entrance fee, I guess the entrance is free on the weekends. You are allowed to take pictures of the different exhibition rooms they have but you are going to be requested to go through an X-ray security checkpoint before entering the hall where the exhibition rooms are. I highly recommend you to go to this museum if you are interested in the history of Korea and of course if you are willing to spend two to three hours there because the museum is huge.", June 2019

67,5.0,Very good & informative visit,, July 2019
68,5.0,A must visit.,"If you are visiting Seoul, there are three places that is must in my opinion. Gyeounbokgung palace, National Museum of Korea, and The War Memorial of Korea are the three, The first two will provide visitors with the sense of Korean culture, history, and the language that is unique to Korea. The last will give you an insight into the recent history of the nation that overcame the tragic and catastrophic events that were Japanese occupation, liberation, and Korean War.", July 2019
69,5.0,"It’s free and has a beautiful, large park!","It may not be quite as interesting as the War Museum (the best free museum in Korea), but it does get the silver medal. Great way to spend a few hours out of the sun or rain and when the weather is right, enjoy the large park outside. In fact the park is superb... mini-rivers and waterfalls, play area for kids, lots of green space and trees - great way to relax. Highly recommended... a very cheap day out!", July 2019

Note that there are people jogging and they have small trails winding around pagodas and meditation nooks.  It was so peaceful without the crowd and by noon it was already hot.  The museum entrance is free and they have two special exhibits.  The exhibits costs KW7500 and for people who has not much interest on it, I recommend you pass.  The main museum artifacts are more than enough for a short visit (approx. 1 hr).  There is a convenience store open prior to 10AM and I saw two restaurants that were still close when I left the grounds.  I suggest coming early to avoid bus loads of kids visiting the museum.", May 2019

We did not do the audio tour, but we did do a guide tour (in English) that lasted about an hour and highlighted some of the National Treasures in the museum.  The guide spoke very good English and was very knowledgeable.  We definitely recommend doing a guided tour if you can arrange to visit when they are available.  The guided tour, like the rest of the museum, is free.  Be  sure to save time to explore the beautiful grounds outside the museum as well.  If you are doing the free guided tour, then I would say give yourself 2 hours minimum at the museum, though we could have spent more time there if we had more time to spare.", March 2019

The displays (all with English signage) provide a sampler of the history and culture of South Korea.  There are several places to eat both inside the museum and outside but on the museum grounds. Each floor has a couple sets of rest rooms, and places to sit and rest. As for getting there, subway access is easy; from the maps I saw, I was concerned we might have to walk across a large parking lot to get from the subway to the museum, but not so; there is a direct underground tunnel from the subway to the museum entrance plaza; although some walking is involved, it's comfortable and quiet.", April 2019

The stone pagoda, golden tiaras/belts and the pottery at the end are beautiful. The Museum gift shop was one of the best we found in Seoul, very reasonable prices, esp. the postcard set of 25 for $10. The reflective glass makes it hard to take good photos of some items. Compared to other Seoul attractions, the museum is quiet and spacious (built less than 25 years ago.)", October 2018
