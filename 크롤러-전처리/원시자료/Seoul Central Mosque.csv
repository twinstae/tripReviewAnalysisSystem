1,3.0,Glad to Find a Place to Worship in Seoul,"We visited the Seoul Central Mosque on a Jumuah.  It is down a small winding road that was so backed up with traffic while heading to Jumuah that we got out of our taxi and walked a bit of the way.  There was no clear signage for the sisters' prayer area. There were so many there to pray that brothers were praying outside.  We followed some sisters to a cramped prayer area.  It was so tiny compared to what Iater got to see was the brothers' area that I wondered if it was meant to dissaude sisters.  The khutbah was in Korean & Arabic. Don't recall there being an English portion.  After salat we got a better look at the masjid. It was once again difficult to find signage as to where sisters' should go. When I went toward the main entrance looks told me it wasn't the right spot, but no assistance.  Eventually my daughter and I found the way.  The masjid was lovely in the standard masjid way, however, once again the sisters' area was difficult to get to. It was up 3 flights of stairs (I thought about mothers with babies) and once you got upstairs it was once again a tiny space that was blocked off from viewing the khateeb.  So sisters if you're hoping to get a good look of a masjid in another country while you are visiting, don't get your hopes up for that. Go to pray and you would have met your goal!  Alhamdulillah.  We were so glad to find the masjid, pray there and be amongst the Muslims. May Allah reward them for establishing the masjid and the salat.", August 2019

27,5.0,Beautiful Mosque,"After a good meal at the Eid Restaurant nearby, I headed towards the mosque. It was during winter and I realised that the praying hall was upstairs and the place to take wudhu was located near the car park, in a container-ish block. So, I had to go up to the entrance of the prayer hall, took out my shoes, wore a pair of slippers provided and went down to the wudhu area with my freezing feet! I wasn't complaining as it was just an experience as I've never been to a place this cold.It is such a peaceful mosque. And beautiful too. I went with my wife and son. It is located in Itaewon district so, expect a short uphill journey from the train station to the mosque. It's not that hard to find as you will see the entrance from afar. More stairs to get to the mosque compound.Highly recommend to visit if you happen to be in Itaewon area. And if there's a chance, visit during Friday prayers. It would be a good experience.", December 2016

The mosque and its compound itself were clean and nice. However the road leading to the mosque - with its many halal restaurants and turkish supermarket- was shockingly dirty! Cigarette butts, rubbish, empty boxes/ bottles etc littered the streets in front of the shops and garbage bags were stacked high in the side streets. Compared to the other areas in Seoul this part of Itaewon seemed seedy.", December 2016
32,5.0,Beautiful...,"This is a beautiful mosque that is kind of hidden in Itaewon. It's not on the street. You have to walk in a big gate decorated with Islamic art and then go uphill a little bit to see it.What's baffling (and funny, actually) is that there is a red light district (and it's very red) literally 1-2 min walk away from this mosque. Whichever was there first, their presence next to each other is contradictory (unless I'm missing something). It's kinda like seeing a criminal hideout next to the central police station. Unless if the police was corrupt, then that would explain it, but... Who knows?", October 2016
33,4.0,Good Masjid,"It was located at very Nice Area of Seoul , It is Clean, and the other advantage of this Masjid is near to many halal restaurants", December 2016

40,4.0,Heart of Itaewon,"The only mosque in Seoul is in the heart of Itaewon. It's a must-visit for any Muslim who's looking for a place to pray and for someplace to get good halal food. The climb to the mosque is a bit steep so it may be tough for someone who has knee trouble.

Near the mosque are plenty of restaurants that serve halal food such as Eid which serves traditional Korean food.", April 2016

46,5.0,The one and only Mosque in Seoul,"Since I am a Moslem, then this place surely becoming a must-visit place for me in Seoul. This mosque is the one and only mosque in Seoul and since it's SUPER hard to find places to pray for Moslem in Seoul, than this place somehow will bring some happiness for you who crave a proper place to pray.

47,5.0,Mosque and Islamic Center in Seoul,"Whenever I am in Seoul, this is one place that I always make a point to visit. One can meet other  Muslims in Seoul who live in the city and other muslim travelers. In fact, I was there during Ramadhan in 2015 and got a chance to break my fast with other mosque goers!As many reviewers have mentioned, this is the biggest, if not the only Mosque in Seoul. It has his own history and has other activities organized, not only the 5 daily payers, Friday prayer and Taraweeh in Ramadhan. The mosque is located in Itaewon area - so accessible by train, although, you must walk a little bit and it could be literally  an 'uphill battle' for some people :-) However you will be definitely be rewarded with the experience.

52,4.0,Stands out amid the ever-present crosses,"The sight of the minarets at the top of the hill gave me two very different feelings. The first was delight at seeing something so welcoming among the endless skyline of Christian crosses topping the churches of South Korea. The second was the challenge of the climb up after an already long day of walking and navigating the public transit systems of this mega-city.There is a large diagram in the entry gate area that directs Muslims to their gender appropriate ablution areas and also contains information for the non-Muslim visitors to allow them to visit both respectfully and comfortably.The women's prayer room is a little hidden away both to find in the first place and then in its setting relative to the men's prayer room, which has a wide and obvious entryway. The stairs to the third floor are not well marked. Once inside the hallway the welcome signs fall away to multiple requests to remove one's shoes and a scattering of shower shoes clutter the floor. However, once upstairs the balcony prayer area is nice. Heavily carpeted with a low wall that allows a view of the main prayer room below, it is clean, quiet, well ventilated, and provides many additional supportive materials like prayer rugs and head scarves.It was well worth the climb up the hill.", April 2015
53,4.0,Korea's first and Seoul's only mosque,"This is Korea's first and Seoul's only mosque, erected in 1976 and located on a hilltop. To get here, you can take the subway to Itaewon station Line 6 Exit 3. Its a 10mins walk from the station. Along the streets leading to the mosque, you will find many halal restaurants (including korean halal cuisine), kebabs counters, and a halal supermarket. You will first see the entrance of the mosque (decorated in blue mosaic), take the stairs and beyond that is the mosque. The men's prayer hall is located at the main building and the wuhdu area is outside near the carpark. The ladies wudhu area and prayer room is in another part of the building. The prayer hall and toilet are rather small. We came in March (towards ending of winter) and yet it was cold to take your wudhu outside of the building (for the men). So in winter, it will be even colder.Visit this mosque if you have the opportunity. I understand that they are building funds for the reconstruction project of this mosque. So do donate if you happen to be there :)", March 2015
54,3.0,comfortable.,comfortable for muslim to pray but the toilet too small. easy to find halal food. the direction signboard confusing to follow., November 2014
55,5.0,Great to see such a building in a non-Islamic country.,"Great little mosque for the Muslims of Seoul and all those who are travelling there. I went for Friday prayer and it was rather busy with prayer mats outside for those who couldn't fit inside the main prater hall. To take wuduk you need to go into a small cabin that is a little walk from the prayer hall, so in the winter, I would recommend going there with you wuduk ready. For females there is a special area for their wuduk.It is lovely to see such a building in a country that isn't Islamic. In England most mosques are small houses or a school hall - so to see the acceptance of Islam and the freedom to pray by the Koreans is lovely.The local area is full of halal food - so it was great to eat halal food without worrying. There is a great book store just down the road from the mosque where you can buy great Islamic books for a reasonable price!", March 2015

57,5.0,Large & Beautiful Masjid,"I had a chance to read my Magrib prayer here, on my two night trip. I was amazed on the size & stuture of the Masjid. Beautiful minarats and a large dome. It seems the Masjid had a a lot of facilities, i.e women area in the bottom half. Good scenery of Seoul because the Masjid is at the top of the Hill. A lot of halal shops around.", November 2014
58,4.0,Islamic tourism centre,A very nice mosque located on the hill top. An adjoining islamic school built together with the school and found out that they are plan to refurbish and extend the building. There are a lot of Muslim restaurants available nearby but it will be a lil expensive. You may find 2 groceries stores nearby the mosque with 100% halal ingredients. Nice Seoul view from the mosque parking area., November 2014
59,5.0,Masjid on a Hill,Beautiful Mosjid with an adjoining islamic school located on a hill top. Bit of a steep climb. Had the pleasure of praying one afternoon during Nov'2014.

While the mosque itself is very different from the typical mosque that you can find in muslim countries, it is also located in Ittaewon area, where lots of stores for shopping is available. Many halal food is also available here.", July 2013

64,4.0,The Middle East comes to Seoul,"Beautiful mosque, easy to get to, and inspiring to see such diversity in Seoul. I would recommend at least stopping buy, doesn't take long to view it  check out for the garden as well.", November 2013
65,4.0,Trace of Islam in Seoul,"I've been curious to trace the trail of Islam in this country, where it's not the majority, so I decided to pay a visit to the only mosque in Seoul. I walked from Itaewon station till I found Dunkin Donuts (yes you got it right) and I turned right. I walked and found some halal restaurants and shops along the way. I kept walking until I realized that I was lost (because I couldn't find it!) so I walked back and found out that I should've turned left on a junction before (there was actually a sign and I couldn't find it!)The road there was pretty steep and long, so be prepared. Better wear your running shoes (again). For women, the praying room is on the 3rd floor, so get ready to climb the stairs. the interior was good and the praying mat was thick and soft so it was pretty comfortable.", July 2013
66,5.0,A must see!,"I attended Jumuah prayers here.  The salaah begins early (at about 1:30pm) so get there early.  It's the only mosque in Seoul so the place gets packed.  Separate Ladies facilities are available,  which is to the left of the main entrance if you stand facing the mosque. The wudhu facilities are looked to the right of the mosque entrance in what appears to be a 40-foot container-like structure.  The mosque is abit of a walk from the itaewon station, but given the very little halal places in Seoul, it is a welcome sight and you feel quite at home. The adjacent area had many Islamic shops and halal eating places (beware: a lot of the indo-Pakistan owned restaurants are licensed, which would annoy if you are after strictly halal food).", September 2012
67,4.0,"Tiring, but worth it.","Its kinda tiring to walk to this mosque as you need to walk through over two steep hills, but its totally worth a visit (tourist centre at Itaewon station is a big help!) We've done prayer there, and Muslimah prayer room is at level 3 (please take wudhu first before going up okay sisters?) Lots of halal eateries around, ranging from Turkish, Pakistan, Indonesian and even halal Korean cuisines. Its easy to shop for halal stuffs too.", June 2013
68,5.0,Lovely Mosque at Night!,Went for a visit at the only Mosque in Seoul. The mosque is situated in the centre of housing / business district. The mosque is not on the main road. So you need to walk down the small road.  The mosque is a beauty. For Muslims its a must visit place. You can find as well halal food choices around the vicinity. It has a fine architecture. Pro's : Lovely visit & can do some prayers inside.Con'S : Ready to walk uphill. Its about 100m walk from main road uphill!!, September 2012
