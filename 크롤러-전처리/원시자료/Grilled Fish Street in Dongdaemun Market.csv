0,5.0,Great Food! Eat like a local..treat like a star!,First went in 2015 and return in 2019...we called them Ahjumma Restaurant..the very first restaurant when you reach the alley. Taste still remain great as before from their grilled fish to nakji to sondubu jigae...banchan absolutely superb! Ahjumma to Ahjusshi to Hyung were so, February 2019
1,5.0,Excellent food at extremely good prices,Grilled fish at Dongdaemun Grilled Fish Street. The cutlassfish (top piece) had an amazing natural sweetness and a soft texture.  The Spanish mackerel (bottom piece) had a ‘mackeral’ taste that’s much more fragrant than the usual mackeral we eat in sg. This was so good we came back the next day! And the whole meal for our family of 2 adults and 2 young kids only cost 18000 won!, October 2019
2,3.0,Just grilled fish but it is a local experience,"We (or I should say my wife) were looking for shoe street, went the wrong way and followed the smell. We went into the first restaurant and went upstairs, had to take our shoes off but the floor is clean, just the ceiling is low. If you are not flexible don't go upstairs, you have to sit on the floor and after a while, I couldn't bend my legs. We ordered just one fish for 10,000 won, you get free rice and some Korean side dishes. The best way to eat is to see how the locals eat it and do the same. After they take your order they don't bring it to your table, they bring it up and yell the name of the dish and you raise your hand. The problem is that if you don't know Korean and raise your hand you might get the wrong order. If you eat it before they catch it they might make you pay it. We didn't because it was so busy that they didn't have time to argue with my wife. The grilled fish is OK but nothing spectacular, I would call it local fast food.", October 2019
3,5.0,Best grilled fish ,We have been wanting to try grilled fish and search online and found there is a grilled fish street in Dongdaemun so decided to try since we are going there to shop.There were alot if grilled fish shop in the whole street. Initially we wanted to try the first store that we passed by cos the ahjumma was friendly and the restaurant seems busy. However decided to walk and see the rest. We then walked into one of the grilled fish restaurant but the attitude of the ahjumma was terrible so we walked out and went back to the first store. At least this one has menu with english and chinese wording.We ordered the grilled mackarel and stew and was so good. We finished everything and was glad to have tried grilled fish in seoul., September 2019
4,4.0,Great food street in the beart of Dongdaemun,"This is a really nice food street located beside Dongdaemun Shopping Complex and specializing in grilled fish but also with other kinds of freshly cooked seafood. The place is pretty vibrant with lots of vendors grilling their fish outside their small restaurants. You can see workers pushing their trolleys with boxes of produce around here and the smell of grilled fish is very enticing.This street is a great place to see some local food culture and is very well located so after some serious shopping it is nice to stop here for a meal. Most of the vendors, many of them middle aged and older ladies, are friendly and some can speak English which was helpful.Prices are not expensive and the food tastes delicious.", July 2018
5,5.0,"Excellent, cheap and healthy option","This place was quite tricky to find but we’re glad to find it. From JW Marriott Dongdaemun walk north along the river until a bridge. Turn right and find a small alley - if it’s a smokey alley you know you got it. The shops are small, if it’s full, you might have to sit upstairs (shoes off) on the floor - it’s all for the experience. Shop keepers are very friendly and accommodating. Very cheap and healthy food.", October 2018
6,4.0,Greatfood,I was here and soul on business so I wanted to grab a quick bit to eat.   This place came highly recommended by all the locals and some of the other visitors that were staying at my hotel. Your dad a couple of the different dishes cause I was going to take one back with me to eat later and both were delicious. They were fresh for the blue well-made season perfectly and I will definitely be back as long as I am here. Great place to try one in the area, October 2018

8,4.0,Not for late dinners,"We went on a Sunday after 8pm and most of the fish shops were already starting to clean up (though the whole chicken soup restaurants in the same alley were still pretty packed). Thankfully, the grilled fish shop that we went in closes at 9pm so we still had some time to eat. The aunties were friendly, spoke Chinese, and recommended the grilled mackerel. Food was served quickly and the fish tasted great. Didn’t need to dip any sauce cause it was nicely grilled and seasoned. Simple but has a nice comfort food feel to it.", March 2018
9,3.0,Nice cheap food,"Me and friend wanted to have some cheap food and we ate at Jongno. Each of us did not spend more than 10,000 won.", December 2017
10,5.0,Must try grilled fish in Dongdaemun,"In Dongdaemun, there is an alley that has a lot of restaurants which offer grilled fishes menu. You can choose one of them. I had my dinner in one of restaurant (but I forget the name) since the owner was welcoming us warmly. They have 2 floors. at 1st floor, they have tables with chairs but at 2nd floor, they just have tables so we have to sit at the floor. We sit in 2nd floor. It was good and quite cheap with a lot of side dishes and steamed rice. Try their jigae too to warm up your body in the cold weather. Don’t worry to order because they has an english menu. The lady owner was so nice, she gives 1 more grilled fish for free.", October 2017
11,5.0,Value for Money,"There's a whole street of shops selling grilled fish. We order 3 fishes, Mackerel, Swordfish and a third fish that we weren't sure what it was. Nonetheless, it was good, fish was well grilled and tender. We spent about 26,000 won, which was due to choosing the unknown fish and swordfish which are more expensive. Staff couldn't speak english well though and there are no english menus, order by pointing at the fish you want. Staff could speak some mandarin though", December 2017
12,4.0,Well worth a visit ,"A place to down a bottle or two of soju ( 20% alcohol ) with a set meal, approximately 7,000W per grilled fish, served with rice, miso soup and pickles. Very fast and friendly service.", September 2017
13,5.0,Great grilled fish lunch.,"Grilled fish is a better alternative to bbq beef amd pork-- healthier and  more reasonably priced ($30 vs $80). The market is lined with several fish restaurants, so use your gutfeel to choose the best griller who can entice you to come inside their place.", June 2017
14,2.0,Closed on Sunday?,I went on Sunday around 6 pm and the place was closed. No stalls were open for business. Quiet dissapointing because I really want to try their grilled fish and spicy octopus. Is it closed every Sunday or only for special occasion? I don't think 23rd of April is a public holiday. Thinking of going to South Korean again. Hmm., April 2017
15,5.0,Great place to eat ,Eat like a local and experience how regular people eat and live.  This area specializes in grilled fish of all types. Must visit!, May 2017

18,5.0,delicious and affordable,"common, but delicious fish grill. taste just right. excellent service. seller even give extra fish as service for ordering two fish. very kind.", April 2016
19,3.0,Worth a visit,This is one of the best places for street food I found in Seoul. Since the location is quite central it's easy to reach.Close to the large fashion shopping mall and the Dongdaemun Palace., April 2016
20,4.0,Worth The Money,Halal food for Muslims since it is Grilled Fish. Went there twice because of the food. It is truly the best!Very cheap compare to other halal restaurants. If you go there please do order the Grilled Fish & also the Sundubu Jiggae. Worth the money.The hospitality from the owner of the shop also was tip-top!Would definitely go there again., April 2016
21,4.0,Good eats  ,"Have been to the grilled fish street twice. Very inexpensive, good food. We chose to stop at a couple different shops to compare...it was all good. Service could've been better as they monopolize how u can order trying to manipulate u to order more. There are also establishments that offer chicken soup in the same alley where they serve an entire chicken boiled in a savory broth with rice cakes, potatoes, mushroom and veggies. There was an establishment out of character with the rest of the alley at the very end which I thought was rather a damper but just don't wander down that far and u should be good.", February 2016
22,5.0,Worthwhile For The Long Walk,"From Dongdaemun, we walked cross several small street and finally arrived one with many shops selling fried fish.  Though these shops are usually small and local in style, the fishes they fried were absolutely delicious.  We have to repeat our orders in order to compensate for the walk.  Definitely a good place to visit for fish lovers - the price is not expensive (good value for money).", December 2015
23,4.0,Delicious Local Fare Not To Be Missed!,"A Must-Try for Foodie!True local fare offering taste of different type of grilled fishes, served with rice and side dishes. We ordered 3 servings (1 fish per serving) of different fishes for the family, costing abt 7,000 won per serving (quite affordable). And all gone in 15 min...our kids took to it like a fish to water 😀. We regretted not trying the other assortment of fishes before flying off.Grilled fish street is where we saw many locals eat...good place to just soak in the local ambience (Gwangjang market is another). The place (which operates from 6.30am to 7-8pm) is walking distance (5-7min) from our hotel in Dongdaemun but also easily accessible via their subway (Line 1).Will come again.", December 2015
24,5.0,A must visit so you can taste variety of Kimchees for low prices,"For every fish you order, there will be complimentary rice, cold water and also variety of banchans (kimchee) that come with it. Make sure you try different stalls so that you can taste different types of banchans. Price is low and wont rip your pocket.A must visit but make sure to go early as it will close around 8.30 pm", March 2015
25,5.0,So good we went back twice!,"This street is like a little dark street off Dongdaemun. Even now when I think about it I might salivate! We went back twice to the very first store, which had TV interviews. Even with a meal for three, the bill came to around £18 only!!! Fish is fresh and grilled to order - our family loved it so much we went back again!", September 2015
26,5.0,Must try. Real local food.,Love the fish. There're many kind of fish to choose. Also love the other dishes especially Kochujang pan fried pork.Not convenient for big ground and small children. Most restaurants are small and crowded all the time., April 2015
27,5.0,"A must see for those who want the ""hidden Seoul"" experience","I found this place on my second stint in Seoul and absolutely loved it. Its small, cramped, a little dirty, but a must see for those seeking the ""authentic"" foodie experience. You can get any fish from the East Sea grilled up for next to nothing and they've got tons of it. The beer is cheep and your total bill will not exceed 15,000 won ($15 USD). if you have any extra time in Seoul, go here. I took every member of my family who visited, everyone of my co-workers, and several Koreans who'd never been and they all enjoyed the experience.", September 2014
28,4.0,A Must Try - You'll be Wanting More,"Its very easy to locate actually,and we found this alley during our first visit to Seoul in Winter 2013...ordering was also easy because they are so friendly...prices are reasonable too as each order comes with a bowl of rice and lots of varieties of Kimchees. Different stall serves different types of Kimchees. During our second visit in Summer 2014, I came back to this area with 17 people in our group as I brought my students along for a university visit...It was really fun and all stalls are 'big' enough to accomodate all of us. Beware though that it can close very early around 8.30 pm so better get yourself there early to taste those succulent fish! Do try!", June 2014
29,5.0,Great grilled fish,"No frills, no fuss - just great grilled fish amidst the hustle and bustle of the Dongdaemun area. The alley is easy to spot as it is lined with grilled fish restaurants. Unclear of which is the best, I just went into one randomly and found it to be tremendously good. The mackerel I ordered was perfectly grilled and served with rice and a selection of sides.To get there, take the Subway Line 4 (Blue Line) to Dongdaemun Station and exit from Exit 9. Walk straight for about 200 meters and then turn left after the IBK Bank. A few more meters down the road (which is lined with vendors selling all kinds of snacks); and the grilled fish alley would be on your right.", August 2013
30,4.0,Very good meal and very cheap!!!,"I like the fish, and they also provide plenty of side dishes. I accidentally discover this place when I was walking a round to find a shine nearby. The hostesses in the inn that I ate are very friendly. They cant speak English but, you can just point at which kind of fish you want to eat, then you will be served with that, along with rice, soup, an many kind of kim chi... that make a decent meal. One strange thing to me was that: the rice is serve in a clay pot, it really hot. The rice in the pot fit in one bowl of rice, the remain rice in the pot it stick to the bottom, the hostess pour some water in to the pot, after I ate the meal, she said: try this, it is delicious, ""may be for her not for me"". Anyway, this s a should try place. good food and honest people!!!", January 2013
31,5.0,Restaurant after restaurant of charcoal grilled fish!!,"I'm specifically rating the section of the street with the grilled fish and not the surrounding stuff- the street vendors, the stores, the hustle and bustle of bolts of fabrics being delivered on mopeds, etc.  There's a small stretch of alleway full of restaurants that serve up grilled fish.  The restaurant workers are all out, grilling various types of fish over charcoal. To me it smells good.  I love grilled fish.  I gave it 5 stars simply on the fact that I've never seen anything like this in the US and to me,  that alone made it worth venturing to see.  But even better,  if you decide to eat at the restaurants,  the fish tasted fantastic - fresh and relatively mild (at least the one I picked out was). Everyone's trying to get you to come eat at their place so it's kind of hard to decide because it appears they are all selling the same types of fish.  I picked the place with the smiling women, because I liked their smiles. LOL. My husband and I pointed to which fish we wanted; we each selected different fillets.  Then you go inside,  they bring the side dishes (kimchi,  miso soup, rice, shiso leaves, etc) and when the fish is ready,  they bring it to the table.  Most of the fish was about $6 each and there was one for $8.  It was fabulous.  As a warning, be prepared to have the grill smoke blow back into the restaurant when the door opens so for people with sensitive eyes,  this may bother you.  It did me but it's not such a bother that I wouldn't have gone or wouldn't go again.  It's definitely not a tourist trap!  Another side note,  you might want to go to a coffee shop if you need to go to the bathroom,  and not one of the fish restaurants bathroom.  Um,  it wasn't the nicest in the world. These directions are from the KBS website-   Walk out exit 9 of Dongdaemun Station of subway line 4. Walk towards Jongro 5-ga to see the Daehakchon shopping center. In front of the center, take the road on the left leading to Cheonggye-ro and walk 100 meters to reach the food street on the right. The grilled fish restaurants are concentrated at the entrance.", June 2012
