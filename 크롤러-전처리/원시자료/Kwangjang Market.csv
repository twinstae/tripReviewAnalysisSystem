2,5.0,An interesting experience,"Unfortunately on the second day of the lunar year, apart from the street food stalls and restaurants, only like 5 fruit stores and stores selling souvenirs and other things were open. We managed to get some probably overpriced kitchenware. Amongst the four streets in the market, three were on food. The vibrant food stalls were interesting to visit. And yes, the benches were “hot”. The ladies and men serving were nice and there was menu in English, Chinese and Japanese. We also saw Chinese translators seemingly from the Tourist Associations standing by. Should visit", January 2020

The food is incredible no matter where you go, pick what you like, but also take the advice of the friendly vendors beckoning you to their booths. Love this place dearly and you will too.", December 2019
4,5.0,Street food not to be missed,Loved the market as they are primarily run by local Koreans. Definitely recommend to eat at the makeshift stores like a local - the seats are heated and many sell local dumpling noodles which make it so satisfying to have during the winter. This is also the place where you can visit the store which appeared on Netflix’s “street food”. Recommend to have the mung bean pancake and beef tartare.Should definitely visit this place as it is near to Dongdaemun as well so you can always head there after this market, January 2020
5,3.0,Worth the visit(but be prepared for the push and shove)!!,"Lots of stalls selling common street food. Extremely crowded and be prepared for lots of shoving and pushing. Found a stall selling fish shape pancake or waffles. The couple manning the stall were very organised and thoughtful. Their pancakes had only three types of fillings - red bean, custard or pizza. Tried all three and would personally recommend the custard filling. They were very generous with the filings.", January 2020

8,4.0,Quintessential Seoul experience they say ,We went on New Year’s Day so only the food stalls and a few snack and clothing stalls were open. The oil stench was strong from all the mug bean pancakes and there are dozens of stalls selling pretty much the same thing but we were too I adventurous to sit down especially when we have just had lunch an hour before that. The last thing you want is to horde a couple of seats and not consume enough., January 2020

No where can beat this place for its variety and price. I ate there siting on narrow bench in very crowded center aisle. It was quite an experience. Fried sweet rice pancakes are very good.

20,3.0,An average market,"As food markets or night markets go, this one is no more than average.  It is part of a larger produce, fish, chicken and meat (and some clothing) market.Its obvious advantage is that it is covered and so a reasonable destination even in inclement weather.  It also has two clear disadvantages: 1- the variety of food served is very limited.  You have stall after stall serving the exact same thing.  2- the aisles are narrow.  We were there late afternoon on a weekday, and there were spots where passage was difficult.  I wonder whether passage becomes more difficult in the evening or on weekends.", October 2019
21,5.0,Extraordinary food & culture explosion ,"Anyone who saw Netflix street food will recognise Yoonsun Cho. The lady who makes and sells knife cut noodles and Mandu in Kwangjang Market Seoul. Since the show she’s busier than ever but still make and serve the most delicious food. We loved the kimchi in particular. The green kimchi was fresh and different, delicious. We learnt that some of the market traders are jealous of her fame, they need to grow up as she attracts more people from around the world. The mungbean pancakes was also absolutely outstanding. The market is large and offers plenty of choices. Lots of blood sausage, bibimbap, gimbap and plenty other extraordinary delicious Korean specialities worth trying.The market is also well know for steak tartar. The soy sauce pickled crabs are delicious. The market also offers clothing and homewares but definitely worth visiting for the food! It’s a bus place, be patient and go with the flow you will have an amazing time!", October 2019
22,5.0,Mostly food,Whole long stretch of street food where u find live squid as well. Egg pan cake is a little bit oily but is very delicious. This place is very special where u can order food and sit in front of the small stall to eat. Price is reasonable. Next to the main food street there are some stalls selling cloths and sports stuff., October 2019
23,5.0,Best Korean food experience,"We can’t get enough of the mung bean pancake. We had it twice during our visit. We also loved the mini kimbap. Their bibimbap was also quite good. If we go back to south korea, we are definitely including this market again in our itinerary. piannskitchen.com", September 2019
24,5.0,A great way to experience Korean culture,We visited by subway station Jongno 5-ga.It is 50 metres from the station.There are lots of food stalls selling multiple local dishes.We chose a family run fish restaurant that was popular with local people.We had kimchi chilli and cabbage starters and spicy pollock roe stew which blew our heads off much to the amusement of the Koreans.We communicated in sign language.Luckily they sold cold beers.A great experience., August 2019
25,4.0,Lots of “street food” options,"Was initially a bit confused and intimidated by the setup but eventually found it be a very way to discover new food.  Not sure who is buying the clothes on sale but the food stalls definitely attract lots of customers.  Just need the guts to sit down at one of the places and give the offerings a try.  Seems to be segmented a bit by seafood, noodles, etc.  Ended up having delicious food for very little money.  Food stalls were closing up fast at 3PM when we were there so get there early enough to have options.", September 2019
26,5.0,Love it!,"We went there as part of our ""explore Seoul"" trip and it was worth it! The atmosphere and energy were unmatched. The ox head meat made it worth the hassle!", October 2019
27,4.0,Good for one visit only?,"My family sat at a stall that was empty at the time (but as we finished our lunch all the empty chairs were almost full). Tried the great spicy tteokbokki and shared some mandu (dumplings), gimbap, fish cakes and bibimbap.  Perhaps not the best food I ate during my stay, but very decent.The issue I saw was that most food vendors seemed to serve the same dishes and although I can’t compare their cooking styles, this fact would make me think twice to return. When we went to see the Myeongdong Nanta show all the street vendors were offering their innovative cuisine in the streets (including lobster with cheese) and all the stalls offered something different. I wish this market offered that (or at least some type of) dish variety.", September 2019
28,4.0,Night tour,"One of our stops on the night tour was the Gwangjang Market where some of my family members were brave enough to try eating live octopus. I was not even brave enough to sit at the same table with them. I did try their famous pancakes from one of their vegetarian stalls and was mildly impressed. The best find for me in this market was their donuts. The line was long but moved fast. They could not make them fast enough. My family went back for seconds. If you are ever in this market go for the freshly made donuts (its soaped long instead of round), the taste is worth every calorie. You can watch it being made as well. Priced moderately.", September 2019
29,4.0,Busy food stall market & other stalls,Easy to find from subway exit 9. This market is busy with food stalls & lots of variety. An excellent way to try a little of different korean foods.

30,5.0,A taste of Real Korea ,"We watched  Netflix show about street food of Seoul and it was a must do and see for us when we visited Seoul last week.  We managed to find the stall from the show which makes the famous mung bean pancakes 🥞. The market was so big and it felt like it wasn’t ending.  You can find anything there: food, clothes, fabric, sea food ... it’s definitely a must visit in Seoul as you will experience a real Korean culture.", September 2019
31,5.0,Korean street food classics,"The Kwangjang (sometimes spelled Gwangjang) market is a real foodie heaven. Many resources on the internet say it closes at 6PM and this may be true for many of the shops, however the food scene seems to be going strong at least until 10:00 PM. Here you will find many street food classics such as mung bean pancakes, Korean blood sausage, dumplings, steak tartare, fresh octopus and many others. All menus are in English, I don’t see why you would book a tour to come here to eat - read up on the Korean street food dishes and venture out on your own - I met several nice Koreans as I was hoping from stall to stall who was very friendly and wanted to share their food culture and their Soju with a total stranger. Geonbae!", September 2019

34,5.0,Just as good on a second visit,Street food in abundance. Live fish for sale and local delicacies (unidentifiable to me). Sitting at a stall or one of the rooms is probably better than getting a take-away as the 'to go' option involves a lot of plastic and polystyrene packaging., August 2019
35,4.0,interesting place to visit,worth a visit to check out the food. didn’t spend that much time here but my favourite stall was the kalguksu (knife-cut wheat flour noodles in soup) and mandu (dumplings) stall made famous by the netflix street food show (happy to report that it is worth the hype and the possible wait for seats as it’s now a hot spot for foreigners thanks to the show). it’s also a good place to shop for fabrics if that’s what you’re looking for!, September 2019

42,5.0,Must visit for an authentic and cheap Korean meal,"Gwangjang market is the place  to see the locals do their daily marketing.  Besides the usual tteokbokki ( spicy ricecakes), you should try the fried  mungbean pancakes, served with a delicious soy sauce onion dip. This market caters to the locals, so it is as authentic an experience watching Korean people buy and sell. A food paradise for people who love to eat or cook.", November 2018

45,5.0,I had a blast ,"This place is a must see to in my book. I had a Seoul Korean native who lived in the States for 25 years give me a tour after moving back to Seoul for the past 11 years. Took me places that tourist would NEVER see and many Koreans don’t even know about it. This was one of his stops and gave me the history of the Market and how it grew and expended over decades. This is the largest traditional Korean markets and is known for food, silk and anything you want to find. You can also book a tour through TripAdvisor", July 2019
46,1.0,very disappointed,"Went with my brother to have a good experience as seen online. One of the food stall owners was very pushy and persuaded us to sit down after saying she'd give us ""service"" (free food). We ate some and asked if we could take the rest of the food away as we wanted to leave quickly, still thinking it was ""service"". Also important to note I spoke Korean though I'm not 100% fluent. I was quite naive, and at this point she added more food that we didn't ask for. I then asked how much this would all be(as it was a lot for free food) and she told me it was 16,000won. I then felt pressured into paying because she purposefully gave us a lot of food without asking. The stall owner was very old and our Korean wasn't good enough to argue with her. My brother was also feeling sick. At the time, there were a lot of people as well as the weather being very rainy and humid, so we just wanted to get away as soon as possible. Make sure to be very firm with what exactly you want to eat and always ask straightaway as to how much the food will be or make sure that the food is still ""service"" if offered.", July 2019
47,4.0,Great Market Place to experience local culture ,"Great Market Place to experience local culture & food. Many tastes of local Korean food like the Korean pancake, noodles, kimchi, gimbap, seafood & etc. Dry preserved seafood can also be found there.The other side of the market is fabric area which closes in the evening after the food market comes alive.Walk around Jungno-gu you can also find fruits & flower markets.", July 2019

I purchased some apples and peaches, which were rather expensive. Suggest you buy fruits from other places.", June 2019
50,4.0,"Souvenirs, food, something for everyone","No, this is not an upscale, ultra-clean chain department store where credit cards are king -- it is a market with numerous food stalls are centered along the walkways and sellers of fish, produce, silk, souvenirs, kimchi, housegoods and junk line the walkways. For me, all the food looks alike but obviously some are better than others as they are very busy and others have no customers.

The shop keepers are very friendly and welcoming and can speak a multitude of languages ranging from english, chinese and japanese, so communication really shouldn't be a problem no matter where you're from. All the food is fresh or made on the spot and you can see them prepare it. You can either take away the food or sit down at the stalls themselves to enjoy the food items. Price wise, it isn't expensive at all and you are utterly spoiled for choice of what to eat at Gwangjang market. There is a lot to see and observe and is a definite must-see location when in Seoul. I'd personally recommend ordering the kimbap, japchae, jajamyeon, pumpkin porridge, tobeokki and the kimchi pancakes!", May 2019

Love the dumplings from one stall right at the end of the food alley. Many aunties are selling similar food but depending solely on each skill to attract patrons.   The other alley are stalls selling korean costumes and modern clothings.  You should bargain, but not too much.  Another alley has stalls selling daily necessities, like towels, scrub towels, etc. And another alley has stalls selling the different types of titbits like seaweed cracker, seaweed, almonds.

60,4.0,Netflix Street Food featured vendors inside,"We came here for lunch and entered on the textile entrance of the market.  About halfway into the building is when we finally started to  see the food stalls.  The first stop was a fish  cake stall where we ordered two, each W1000.  Both came impaled on a stick along with a cup of broth.  Both types of fish cakes were decent and the soup was flavorful.We were still on the hunt for a good lunch spot when we came across a stand with a large photo of Netflix on it.  It turned out to be one of the vendors, Yoonsun Cho, showcased on an episode of Street Food.  It was food stall #70 and had one of the largest seating areas which was a stand-alone stall surrounding the cooking and prep areas compared to all the others we walked by.  We had to wait about ten minutes before a bench opened to accommodate the whole family.  During the interim we watched her make some of her hand cut noodles and prep a number of bowls.  Everything we tried was very good from the kimchi mandu to the hand cut noodle and the cold buckwheat noodles (we ordered spicy but it didn’t pack much heat).  Overall they ran a very efficient operation for the lines of people wanting to eat here and the food was reasonably priced at W5000 each for majority of the menu items.There also was a mung bean fried cake vendor featured on Netflix but we were too full to give hers a try.The market was crowded and together with all the frying the temperature got a little warm inside.", May 2019

68,5.0,Food will blow your mind,"I came here for some souvenir shopping which was very successful, but my mind was blown by the food court. I wish I had been as careful as I was with the souvenir shops, not buying at the first store because the deeper I got into the food court the better looking the food got, but I was already full! The fried pancake filled with pork, sold right in the crux of the market was delicious. My daughter and I had fruit slushes out on the street side, but had we stayed toward the middle there were many more flavors available. Great atmosphere and great prices. Not much bargaining going on.", May 2019
69,5.0,Wonderful Market,"A MUST visit if you are into following media tracks such as KD drama and other popular places.  We went to this market to try NETFLIX handmade star :)The noodles were springy and yummy! The entire process can be seen right in front of you.  dumpling and noodle making. As simple as 3 cauldrons to cook everything to serve people who would wait in 3 layers behind the stools.We had the handmade noodles (5000Won) and the mixed dumplings (5000Won)Both simple but for some reason we ended up going back the next day to have it again.  Simplicity at it's bestNote the stall is near the south gate (stall # 70).  If there's something worthy to add, try to find the place along the middle of the walk way as everyone practically sells the same thing but it is only this stall who the overflowing customer (the magic of media).  this means the other stalls are not so keen in helping out find her.  before you leave, don't forget to buy some of the local KR crackers (Yummy) and kimchi - ALL TYPES!

79,5.0,Must go at least once,"Gwangjang market was our go to brunch destination. They offer things from spices to fresh seafood, pickled food to textiles. But let’s be honest, my only reason for going there is to eat. So many rows of food stalls and so many things to choose from. We had to come back twice to sample all the food we wanted. I love the meat/mung bean pancakes, the kalguksu with mandu. You can also get the live octopus (sannakji) here.

83,1.0,Beware of Ahjumma-sticky-fingers!!!,"Gwangjang Market is very busy and now it seems the owners have learned to take advantage of this.I went into an accessory shop to buy my niece a few things for her first birthday. The ahjumma quoted me a price of 46,000₩. While she went to the back to get a plastic bag for me, I placed a 50,000₩ note on the counter. I turned to look at a few more items while she was packing my things. My back was turned away from her, and she tells me I gave her 5,000₩ instead of 50,000₩.😲I know for certain I had two 50,000₩ notes with me because I had just gone to the ATM and withdrew them.I asked her if she had CCTV in her store...and of course, she didn't. Her ""friend"" another ahjumma store owner (conveniently) walked up and said she was watching the entire time and a money switch was not possible.The whole situation was sketchy and it seems like these ladies do this as often as possible.I suppose I could have called the police, but without CCTV, I felt I really didn't have a choice but to leave....without my 45,000₩.So....shoppers beware. NO MATTER HOW LONG YOU'VE LIVED IN KOREA and even though you believe Korean people don't steal....never, ever, ever....leave your money on a counter. In my 10 years here, I never thought this could happen....glad my lesson only cost me $45.🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️🙅‍♀️", April 2019

89,5.0,Mind blowing ,"The two markets I visited in Seoul were Namdaemun and Gwangjang, both on a Saturday. I enjoyed Gwangjang the most. It was more crowded, especially in the afternoon. The street food style eating is much better than Namdaemun. There is everything you could want. We ate bimbap and tteokbokki while seated on a heated bench; 3000 won each and generous. At another stall, we ate a honey pancake. Delicious! Walked around for a couple of hours, including across the street where there are many climbing gear shops. Expensive, but fun to browse. One even serves beer and coffee. Look for the one called “mygear”. Vas’s beer in a 16 oz glass is 3000 won. Coffee made to order. Very nice host.

107,4.0,A unique undercover market well worth the visit,"My partner and I had an afternoon free while in Seoul, and after checking some possibilities decided that Gwangjang Market appeared to be within a decent walking distance from our hotel on the western edge of Myeongdong.Using our trusty Google maps we set off... and what a journey that turned out to be. For some reason we found Google maps (normally very reliable wherever we travel...) tended to get a bit confused at times around Seoul...) to take us on a somewhat weird path to Gwangjang Market... down a variety of minor streets and laneways... on and on we walked, and walked, and walked... until FINALLY we located Gwangjang Market, and what we THOUGHT was a main entrance, off Cheonggyecheon-ro Street, so we entered.It is an indoor market, BUT... all we could see were aisles and aisle of what seemed to be mainly fabric, bedding, manchester, linen etc. shops and stalls, AND... they were almost all closed! What a disappointment, after having followed Google for maybe 25 minutes around strange streets. This certainly is a large market, somewhat along the lines of Chatuchuk Market in Bangkok. We checked down various aisle/passageways/arcades, but just more of the same, and virtually nothing open. But they weren't the types of stalls/shops we thought we would find here anyway.After several minutes of checking out various arcades, we were about to give up, when we decided to checkout way down the other end of a very long aisle of shops where there appeared to be some kind of a food shop open. And Hey Presto...!! Here was what we were looking for.It turns out the Gwangjang Market is more huge than we thought, and that there are apparently two main areas. The first being the more commercial area that we had encountered (off Cheonggyecheon-ro Street), and then at the other end of this huge complex, AND... with its own main entrance off Dongho-ro Street, was the market we thought we were to be visiting. Lots of unique food stalls and street food, bric-a-brac, fruit and vegetables, a huge variety of drink and ice-cream shops and stalls etc. etc. This part of the market is a huge market in its own right. And this part of the market was VERY busy when we visited. It appears to be more popular with the locals, with families buying treats, food, ice-creams etc. for their children, tourists sampling the street foods etc.From what we could gather, the more commercial part that we initially entered into is apparently only open certain hours or days of the week, whereas the part we now found ourselves in is apparently open every day. Eureka...! It wasn't a wasted day after all.I love to sample street food items in whatever country I am visiting, so this section of Gwangjang Market certainly provided a wide variety of options. Gwangjang Market is definitely worth a visit if you have a couple of hours to spare, excluding your travel time to get there. You could probably get away with an hour there, or you could easily stretch it out to at least two hours.Oh... and regarding travel time... We departed Gwangjang Market via the Dongho-ro Street entrance, and THIS TIME Google maps presented us with a much more direct, and more obvious route back to our hotel, which we could have done in almost half the time on the outward journey... except that we dropped off in the Myeongdong shopping streets for another look around, and to get dinner.", November 2018
108,4.0,So many markets! Glad to have visited this one,"When we were there, the locals definitely outnumbered tourists, which is a good thing. The buffet breakfast in our stomachs allowed us to take our time watching what eateries the locals were patronizing. They know what's good, so I'm following them. Obviously, we can't read Korean, so I just took pictures (see attached). The best pancakes seemed to be the one with the orange sign (says since 1994). We sat in front on the benches with tables, enjoyed our 4000 Won pancake while watching customers go in & out of the dine-in restaurant. Plus, many locals were buying takeaway plastic containers of uncooked pancake mix. Amazing, it's that popular! Then 2 different stall owners told us to eat the 2500 Won Japchae (transparent noodles with sesame oil and soy sauce) from this lady at stall #41. We just sat on stools holding our plates and watched this endless line of folks buying the 3 things they sold. We were also impressed how the 2 ladies left their money sitting in 2 bowls for all to see and everyone stayed honest!", November 2018

I tried a few fried items first, delicious. After browsing the stalls I sat at one and ate a bowl of fresh Bibimbap. The bowl was filling and very affordable. The market itself was crowded obviously in the evenings, but there is plenty of room to look, sit, and eat!

125,5.0,Go for the raw beef!  Really!  ,"This enormous market is an absolute must visit when you’re in Seoul.  The market sells goods and foods and this review will focus on the foods.  First, it would be impossible to do this market justice by any single review.  One could spend a month here and still not discover all that it offers.  I was interested in trying Korean beef tatare.  I found my way to “raw beef alley” and picked a place.  The beef here is delivered each morning and is of the highest quality and freshness.  I tried my dish with a chopped live baby octopus on top.  Most westerners may balk at the dish when they see the chopped tentacles moving about on top of a mound of bright red raw beef.  Break the egg yolk on top and dig in!  I guarantee it will be one of the most delicious dishes you have ever tasted.  If you eat sushi and like your steak rare, then it’s not much of a step to eat Korean beef tartare and live baby octopus.", November 2018

A section of the market is dedicated to street food capably managed uniformly by older ladies who do not shy from fighting for your business. 3 items are ubiquitous— Korean sausage made of pork blood and sticky rice, japche stir fried yam noodles and vegetables, and rice cakes.

142,3.0,Overwhelming but still good to visit ,"Lots of vendors selling fabrics, clothes and food.  Pretty intense and overwhelming inside.  Food stalls were all the same.  Sellers were very pushy.  If you stop to look, they automatically try to hand you a menu and make you sit.  We had to keep on walking so that we wouldn’t feel pressured to buy, which didn’t allow us to focus much.  Once we decided to stop at one of the stalls and try out the pancakes, they brought out 2 when we only wanted one so we ended up having to pay for both.  Felt a little tricked because we’re foreigners.  Wanted to look at fabrics, but every time we would stop to check them out, we would get harassed by the sellers and when we’d decide not to buy, they’d get upset and start becoming unfriendly.  It got frustrating a bit.  We did checked out one souvenir shop where the seller was a very nice sweet older man.  Overall, it was an interesting place to see.  I would still recommend it.", October 2018

Not to mention unhygienic and rude atmosphere. You might want to try out just a little food there, but do not plan to have a whole meal because that will cost more than fine restaurants in the city. The quality has been falling for the past few years. Even for Koreans, this place is tough not to get ripped-off.

I’ve travelled across different parts of the world and found Korean food to be quite sweet, as well as pungent. It was cool to sit in the market and l got talking to a girl from Taiwan. Only downside is that a lot of the stalls are very similar, but still a cool place.", October 2018

It is densely packed maze of little tiny shops and street vendors that is wonderful to explore.  The food vendors offer a wide variety of novel foods, prepared right in front of you.

160,4.0,Interesting Korean traditional market,It is very interesting Korean traditional market where you can taste local street food. There are also a restaurants in the market where you can sit down and have a little more formal meal. The pity is that nearly all the food vendors are selling exactly the same traditional food.

162,5.0,Must do when in Seoul,"Loved this place. Sights sounds and smells really make you come alive. The food was the main attraction for ourselves and this is in the centre of the market. Make time however,  to take in the fish, spice, kimchi and textile stores on route. There is a massive choice of places to eat, with each type of speciallity seeming to have the same location with different stall traders servicing the same option in each area. Prices are clearly shown and standard across the piece. Not as cheap as I expected but still much better than western prices. We chose to have just one type of dish (portion ) at each stall so we could try as many things as we could before getting full. Mung bean pancakes were our fav!4000 a portion. Bibimbap 5000 was really good. Fish cakes in a soup were nice at 3000. Sundae a blood sausage filled with spiced sweet rice were fantastic, they are served with cooked liver which reminded me of my child hood 6000. Bottled water is provided free - one central bottle from which you fill your own cup. Alternatively look for stores on the side selling Cass beer in small cans for 2000. Kimchi as usual was served complmentary. Didnt try any fish stuff as off to Busan later. Deffo a great place to try most of Koreas fantastic food in a great atmosphere.", August 2018
163,4.0,Great street food with too much choice,"Big food market, crowded with a confusion of sights, sounds and smells. I was wandering from my hotel looking for somewhere to eat on a sunday evening when many surrounding restaurants were closed and suddenly came across this market with an over-abundance of choice of street food.Common format was to have a cooking stall at the front onto the street with some tables in a room behind. Sitting at the tables was a bit less frenetic. Not much english spoken, but got by fine with 'point and smile' as menus have pictures and an english title for each dish. A meal (a sort of half pancake, half omelette with green beans and seafood) and a beer was 16,000 Won.On a sunday evening I seemed to be the only tourist among thousands of people, many buying a take-away in metal foil containers. Going to the market for a desert of deep fried sweet pastry with a dipping cup of sugar also seemed very popular.", August 2018

173,2.0,Over rated ,"This is probably the biggest and best food market according to the media, went there 1st thing in the morning, very disappointed. Lots of stalls but majority are the same food. Tried to cover each stall, unfortunately I couldn’t eat that much. Went there in winter, and the best thing was the seats were heated! Yes they were heated, how good was that for winter and an open space! But the food ... pretty average, nothing special. I was actually quite disappointed after my trip to Korea overall. I tried all the famous food I saw on the Korean drama, none of them were good. I was very keen on Korean food before, loved everything from the Korean restaurants here in Australia, but since I been there and tried it? I would say the Korean food which’s not from actual Korea is lot better. Korea is quite expensive compare to other Asian countries. Was there for half month and traveled from Seoul all the way down south to Jeju island, the only thing I felt good was the green tea waffle from Jeju island . So if u ever go on food trip, go to China, best food ever on the planet", January 2018
174,3.0,Not as impressive the second time round,"Visited Gwangjang 2 years ago and really liked it and went back this year. It didn't seem as impressive as before and the stalls were quite repetitive. We had some bibimbap at a stall then had some japchae - I ordered one portion and was served two miserable overpriced portions by the corner stall. Then we had mung bean pancakes. Interesting array of Korean street food, some of which are less common like the seafood dishes. It's a tourist trap so beware of upselling and some badgering.", June 2018

177,3.0,Interesting But Intimidating Food Market,"Having seen the Gwangjang Market written up many places as somewhere you had to visit in Seoul, my family went for dinner.  We were very disappointed as it was much more intimidating than expected.  We had already been to many places to eat in Seoul and to various markets.  Gwangjang was among the most frenetic, crowded and dirty of them.  We were not inspired to eat there. Instead, we were more comfortable with the street food in Myeongdong.  I'm sure this is an instance of a difference in Western and Asian sensibilities, but I feel that Western tourists should be made aware that Gwangjang is not like anything you would be used to in the West.", June 2018

There are plenty of tit bits to buy, ranging from ginseng sweets / dried seaweed to chocolates. Also ginseng and other products for making Korean soup. There is a segment with traditional Korean costumes and selling Korean textile and pillows/cushion. The market is structured with a few streets branching out from the Center.

It's a mixture of both as there are stalls that remain tradition selling traditional stuff while some furnished their shop with air-conditioner selling Hanboks. They are divided into sections just like other markets in Seoul that makes it very clear which section you are in. There is a section selling food, which, normally patronized by tourists more than locals. The food stalls there selling identical food stuff so tourists can just choose any stalls to eat them.

The market has clothes and food merchants - we arrived just before lunchtime which enabled us to walk/explore without any issues. Once lunch begins, you will see workers from nearby offices/businesses flock into the market and sit at the various food stalls - usually a shared bench/table which surrounds the vendor stall. There's all manner of Korean food which caters to all different palates. The market also has a large number of Hanbok clothing stores which line the alleyways as well as stores which provide jewelry for the Korean weddings. There's also many men's suit and clothing shops where you can buy suit material or ready-made shirts if you desire. As you explore the many areas of the market, there's even live seafood shops which have produce available for purchase, as well as traditional Korean snacks. We had lunch at one of the many vendors and tried the bibim naemgyeon cold noodle dish and my wife had a noodle soup that had wide rolled noodles (made in front of your whilst you wait).

Local people ignored us tourists and enjoyed their meal. Some of the local dishes were not for the faint of heart. Our guide took us through a factory where costume jewelry was being made for retailers through out the world. There were several hundred little shops with one tow two people working.

At first sight, the market will look a mess but as you enter the maze of inviting stores.The food section of the market was further north with some food stalls entertaining snaking lines of up to 10 patience customers. I found myself a small seating spot and had the following for breakfast:   Topokki (Korean Spicy Rice Cake)   Japchae (Korean Glass Noodle Stir Fry)   Janchi Guksu (Korean Warm Noodle Soup)This is definitely a place I would live to re-visit if I was in Seoul again.

218,5.0,Always loud and smells of food wafting in the breeze.,"It's a traditional market with a mix of prepare food stalls and shops with areas to buy raw ingredients. A must see for anyone coming to Seoul wanting to taste of traditional Korean food. The shop and stall owners can be a bit too friendly trying to get you to eat there, but its all part of the charm. It is jam packed at night so if you want to visit, I recommend going for lunch and sampling food as you walk through. There is some variety in types of food you see but generally encompasses: kimbap(Korean seaweed rice rolls), Tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes), Jeon (battered pancakes with fish, veggies and meats).

They also have live octopus (Sanakji) at the Market, there is a shop located at the beginning of the street which i will not suggest you to go (sorry i forgotten the name, we went for the Sanakji randomly).

It might look rude but it's more motherly. She's just showing you how to eat it. You can sit on any vacant seats. Order up. It's not expensive. Beware of the boneless chicken feet. It's seasoned like fire chicken/불닭. It will set your mouth on fire. This market is also famous for bindaetteok/빈대떡/mung bean pancakes--crunchy, savory, and delicious with rice wine or beer or soju.
