0,2.0,"Spanish museum, not intresting for the ones leaving in Europe","Ticket to the museum is 10000 won in comparison with temples that are around 3000 won. Expensive, small and didn\t find anything intresting.", August 2019
1,5.0,Great way to wander the afternoon! ,, September 2018
2,3.0,Beautiful museum but attracts selfie addicts,The museum was really great and I wish I had more time to look around without having to wait on the crowds of people. I went and visited during the weather exhibit. Very interesting and wonderful. I’d say the customers coming into the museum were 85% female and 15% male (the guys seemed like they were dragged there by the girlfriends). It was a selfie heaven for all the girls so enjoying the actual art itself was a bit distracting with all the sounds of the cameras., June 2018

4,5.0,More than I was expecting!,"From what I read on the other reviews I didn't think it was going to be too much to look at, but boy was I wrong!  It was very ""selfie"" friendly and they knew they were coming to a culture that loves to take photos! The vast diversity was wonderful!  I would highly recommend everyone go and see Plastic Fantastic while it is still at the museum but I think it only has a week or so left!", January 2018
