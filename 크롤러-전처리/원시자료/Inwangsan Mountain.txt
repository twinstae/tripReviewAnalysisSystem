0,4.0,A must hike,"The hike was quite easy even if you're not much fit (but you will need to stop dozen times aling the way). The scenery was great, you can observe the Namsan Tower from far, the Bukhansan Mountain, the Blue House. Start off from  Gyeongbukgong station, take bus 7020/1020/7022 to", December 2019
1,5.0,Good workout!,"I didn't find this in a must-visit list, but since I was 3 weeks in Seoul I decided to explore it. Google it, and you can get information from travelers who'd been there, including which subway exit, and very detailed directions to start your climb. There's an amazing almost 360 degrees view of Seoul. The climb consists of wooden stairways and on some dirt tracks. There is military installation on this mountain where you are not allowed to take photos. Past the military installation and there is your last 500 meters sprint to the highest peak at 338 meters above sea level. I even climbed it twice!", November 2019
2,5.0,Iwangsan Hike,A great hike and not too difficult. We took The Fortress Trail as well from close to the top of Iwangsan. To get there take the train to Dongnimmun and then take the Muak-dong exit. Just follow the road uphill until you see the Iwangsan trail sign., November 2019
3,5.0,The Perfect Hike in Seoul,"This is the best hike you can do in Seoul. The hike is mild challenging and it will only take 2-3 hours to complete both ascend and descend. If you’re fit, you can complete it quickly. For me, weighing at 108kg, I managed to reach the top regardless. Bring 1 liter of water and some snacks to enjoy at the top. The entire hike is mostly full of steps so, it’s pretty straightforward. And you can get the best views of Seoul. It’s a rewarding experience, especially for those who seldom hike.", October 2019
4,5.0,Fantastic hike,Fantastic hike with stunning views in all directions. There are rest points at a few places. Do not advise if have knee or back problems as can be steep on places. But if get to the top... well worth it., June 2019
5,5.0,Pretty fun and intense hike ,I hike a lot and found this a mild challenge. Lots of elevation as the entire thing is up stairs with each step and same on the way back. Bring a at least 1 L water per person on a hot day if you plan to do the whole ridge. You can see how far Seoul expands in all directions., June 2019
6,5.0,Impressive mountain hike within the city boundaries,, May 2019
7,3.0,Confusing trails... Nice view of Seoul,"The trails are poorly marked. It took us quite a while to find the trail head and even after we got to the trails, we couldn't find out way to the top and.... at one point, we walked into an area that's locked.... I still have no idea how did that happen.  Anyhow, we think we managed to take a couple good shots of Seoul from inwangsan.", February 2019
8,5.0,"Awesome climb, beautiful autumn flowers",, September 2018
9,4.0,A steep walk but your reward is great views,"If it is summer, come here as early as possible. It is a steep and sweaty hike up from the metro station. You will pass some shaman shrines, the guide advised against taking photos of the shrines to show respect. One idea is to come here early and visit the prison afterwards. Another idea is to start your walk along the city wall from here, if you do that, bring plenty of water and some snacks (start early).", August 2018
10,5.0,Climbing along the wall. Great sunset. Escape before the night.,, October 2018
11,5.0,The Perfect Hike,, September 2018
12,5.0,Hiking inside the capital city,"Seoul is really hot on summer so we decided to go on hiking since Korean mountains are not that high, especially those in Seoul. It’s easy to access because it is located near the Gyeongbok Palace. The mountain itself is not that high, only 300 meters high, but still has a beautiful view!", July 2018
13,5.0,Mountain in Seoul,The location is just 10 minutes walk from famous Gyeongbokgung palace. It only takes aroung 1 hour 40 minutes to finush the course with the normal speed. Really recomnended for beginner hikers., July 2018

15,5.0,Hiking half day,, April 2018
16,4.0,Mist and cloudy winter morning view,"There are many trails to go to the top of the mountain. There are many stairs at the beginning of the climb, but as you progress, the journey will become harder as the trail can be quite steep. Nice workout!! I sweated all over although i hiked it during the winter. In winter, once you reached the top, all you can see is thick mist, so it is not  advisable to climb it during the winter.", December 2017
17,4.0,Relatively easy hike with great views of Seoul,, November 2017
18,4.0,For all hike levels!,This was fun! You can get great views and good exercise without going to the highest summit. We went as high as we would then found lots of other paths to explore. There are many ways to access this mountain- from steps to paved paths. It was enjoyable and gave us views we’d not seen before., October 2017
19,4.0,Beautiful view of the city and fortress wall,, August 2017
20,5.0,"A must do, for the views","A walk up the mountain, took us 3-4 hours, including rest stops. The incline, which is steep in places, has crude steps that has been cut out of the granite rocks. Nearer the top, a rope handrail is in place to assist at the steep sections that run close by the old city walls. Towards the summit top there is an Army anti aircraft gun placement, Photographing such areas are not allowed, and the police that patrole further up Inwangsan Mountain are there to ensure no photography is done towards the Presidents blue roofed house. Views of Seoul are well worth the effort of the climb up.", July 2017
21,5.0,An alternative view of the city,, November 2016
22,5.0,"Good hike, great views, near subway","No car required: this steep but scenic hike with views over the whole city is very close to Line 3's Dongnimun station. Finding the trailhead is a little tricky. Look for staircases due east of the station, walking between the two station exits on the east side of the road (opposite the prison museum). If you see the city walls, you're headed in the right direction. There are LOTS of steps and some pretty steep bits, but it's worth it.", February 2017
23,5.0,Great for Beginner Hikers,"Coming from Sinchon, this mountain is less than half an hour away by bus. I'm a beginner hiker, hike was relatively easy with a few stops to rest for a bit. Took around 2.5 hours to get to the peak and back, but that really depends on how many stops you take for rest or photography. It's highly guarded, from the mountain the Blue House can be seen. It is not allowed to take photos in that direction.", April 2017
24,5.0,A must-do!,"I was looking to get out of the city-scape a little and fortunately was staying <1 mile away from Inwangsan! Who knew this little hill (let's be honest, it's not a mountain) was so accessible and had such a fantastic view?? I walked from my hotel near Gwanghwamun, but you could just as easily take the purple line to Gwanghwamun station, or the orange to Gyeongbokgung and walk over. Or taxi. I walked up a street ""Inwangsan-ro"" until I saw other hiker-like people and then followed them :) just keep heading up, and you'll get there! I think it was 4 miles roundtrip from my hotel, took me ~2.5 hours as I was walking leisurely and stopped at a couple places on the way back. Worth it!! Better view than N Seoul Tower in my opinion, and way less crowded!", April 2017
25,5.0,Picturesque view on the mountains,"The view from the mountain is really thrilling, though it's very difficult to climb on it. But it's worth it", December 2016
26,4.0,Exploring the beauty of Seoul with an astonishing view over Seoul,, November 2016
27,4.0,Beautiful tracking,Here is one of the mountain where you may enjoy the view of Seoul city. By the way there is two temples and holy rock where the prayers are always avaliable. Be ready to climb high up!, September 2016
28,4.0,Great view. ,Walked up here today. Great view up by the wall. Not sure if I took the best track. Got off metro at Muakjae. Take exit 1 or 2. Narrow street off to the right goes past apartment blocks and the water authority building then on to a track. Came down a different way about 700m further along the main road. Enjoyable hike. I had to use 2 rope ladders. Not many signs and none in English but a good experience., September 2016

30,5.0,a scenic hike along the great wall in seoul,, April 2016
31,4.0,seoul from above,"If you have a couple of hours to spare and want to get away from the business of the big city the inwangsan hiking is the answer. It's more a stroll than a hike, but it's extremely pleasant. Hundreds of steps chiselled out from the rocks to make it very approachable to all. The climb is gentle zigzagging through beautiful plants and trees and when you reach the top Seoul is there at your.", June 2016

34,5.0,Nice hike with beautiful view of Seoul,, November 2015
35,4.0,Great spot to see city of Seoul,"Put your sneakers on and get ready for hiking if you put Inwangsan Mountain on your list. You need to walk a quite steep path, and climb up. Before you climb to the peak, you'll pass Seonbawi Rock and the Inwangsan temple. To find the way is a bit tricky. I wasn't sure whether I was on the right track because I couldn't see the gate from the big road. You will have to walk pass the apartment buildings before you can see the gate.", October 2015
36,3.0,"Nice view, shame you cant take pictures of it :(","This attraction was hard to find and follow due to many of the signs on the track being in Korean only.  I was very let down by all the ""No Photos of the view"" signs at the top as well as the Police / military watch towers.  I went there for the view!  Take lots of water and a hat!", September 2015
37,5.0,Most breathtaking view of Seoul,, September 2015
38,3.0,Nice getaway from the city,"The hike up Inwangsan is a nice way out of the city for a few hours.  There are some awesome views of the city and the defensive wall makes an interesting contrast with the modern towers of Seoul.  It has some steep sections, but it is definitely a part of the capital that is less travelled and worth seeing.", April 2015

40,4.0,Great Views of Seoul,"We started at Dongnimmun station.  Go out exit two and head straight to the first street.  At first street take a left and follow it up through the buildings/apartment complex to the trail head.  You will be going uphill.  As you get closer it will get steeper and there will be stairs.  First stop is the shamanist shrine and Seonbawi Rocks.  There is a shrine at the rocks and we worked our way around the rocks and back to the trail that follows the wall up the mountains.  From the Seonbawi Rocks, you can get a view of the Seodaemun prison.  Also around the rocks are various shaman sites with writings over the rocks and as you work your way back toward the wall you will pass numerous shaman sites as well.  We then hiked to the peak and came down another way.  The trail is steep, but we did it with a 10, 8, and 6 year old.  If you do have children be very cautious as there are numerous drop offs.  I carried the two year old on my back.  The views of Seoul are very good so make sure you go on a clear day.  You overlook the Gyeongbukgung palace and can also look north to the Bukhansan mountains. As we came down a different trail we used the Gyeongbukgung subway station to get back.  Due to the mountains location, you can only take pictures in certain directions for security reasons.  Bathrooms were available at beginning and end of the trail.", August 2014
41,5.0,Great hike along a spiritual trail,"Great views of Seoul alongside dozens of temples and shrines where shamanists perform their exorcism. You'll get the daily exercise and your spiritual fix at the same time. You start and end at Donninmum station, but you can choose to ascend and descend the mountain on different paths.", July 2014
42,5.0,Recommended when in Seoul,, June 2014
43,4.0,Seoul - Shamanist shrine & Buddhist temples walk,"This uphill walk is steep but really rewarding and a great way to get away from the busy city of Seoul - if only for a few hours.  You will see Buddhist temples, a shamanist shrine, and enjoy a great view. Take subway Line 3 to Dongnimmun station - leave by Exit 2 and turn down the first winding alley on your left.  Walk uphill past grocery shops for about 10 minutes and you will see the temple gateway on your left.  If you ask anyone along the way they will be happy to provide you with directions - even if they speak no English.  Everyone knows why you are there and they are happy to point you in the right direction.  Along the way you will see traditional houses and temples with murals that depict the Buddhist way of life.  Eventually you will arrive at the Zen rocks where women come to pray for sons.  A young woman was there when I arrived so I waited for her to finish before looking around.  A big surprise was finding exercise equipment dispersed around the hillside for you to use.  Yes, I'm talking treadmills and stairmasters - very strange! You will see candles, incense, and other offerings set into the hillside as you make your way to the various shrines.  Wear good shoes since the climb is steep and the path can be rocky.", July 2013
44,4.0,Early morning hike,"It was a lovely early morning hike with no disturbances and good views of Seoul. There isn't that much to explore but the fact that it's quiet, very easy to get to from the subway, and gives you a fair workout all put it higher in my esteem.", August 2013

46,4.0,Mount Inwangsan & the Fortress Walk,, May 2013
47,5.0,Seoul's best kept secret!,Inwangsan is truly a treasure in Seoul! The hike itself is relatively easy at a little over 300 meters and the sites are truly rewarding. One of the few places with authentic Korean shaman spirituality!  While hiking I could hear chanting and some unique Buddhist temples. Worth a visit!, October 2012
