1,5.0,The Perfect Hike in Seoul,"This is the best hike you can do in Seoul. The hike is mild challenging and it will only take 2-3 hours to complete both ascend and descend.

2,5.0,Fantastic hike,Fantastic hike with stunning views in all directions. There are rest points at a few places. Do not advise if have knee or back problems as can be steep on places. But if get to the top... well worth it. ,3,82, June 2019,"Singapore, Singapore"
3,5.0,Pretty fun and intense hike ,I hike a lot and found this a mild challenge. Lots of elevation as the entire thing is up stairs with each step and same on the way back. Bring a at least 1 L water per person on a hot day if you plan to do the whole ridge. You can see how far Seoul expands in all directions. ,21,82, June 2019,"Ventura, California"
4,5.0,Impressive mountain hike within the city boundaries,"If you don't want to take on the more challenging Mount Bukhansan, Ingwansan Mountain is a great alternative.

5,3.0,Confusing trails... Nice view of Seoul,"The trails are poorly marked. It took us quite a while to find the trail head and even after we got to the trails, we couldn't find out way to the top and.... at one point, we walked into an area that's locked.... I still have no idea how did that happen.  Anyhow, we think we",90,448, February 2019,"Hong Kong, China"

7,4.0,A steep walk but your reward is great views,"If it is summer, come here as early as possible. It is a steep and sweaty hike up from the metro station.

9,5.0,The Perfect Hike,"If you adore cities, you need to appreciate them from different angles.

18,5.0,"A must do, for the views","A walk up the mountain, took us 3-4 hours, including rest stops. The incline, which is steep in places, has crude steps that has been cut out of the granite rocks.
