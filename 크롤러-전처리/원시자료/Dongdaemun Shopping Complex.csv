But in my point of view, Dongdaemun Shopping mall is not that great place for shopping, cuz there are many low qualty products.

52,2.0,Expensive and rude people,"Even coming from NYC, I consider the prices of the clothing to be ridiculously expensive. Even the most simplest shirts would cost $40. I could tell the fabric is not even high quality. And in the small shops, some of the people are just straight up rude. Some of them glared at us when we touched their clothing just to take a quick glance. And as a foreigner, I couldn't help notice that they tend to prioritize the Koreans first. There were several occasions where we were ignored because the owner would rather help someone who is Korean.On the bright side, some of the clothes were gorgeous. The malls were simply huge which is great for an entire day of shopping. It's only a shame the ridiculous prices and rude people ruined the experience.", July 2016
53,4.0,Cool multi story shopping mall. ,"Finally a mall that has a floor for men..and is cool! I'm moving to Guam, so the clothes here wouldn't do me any help.

Dongdaemun is a budget shoppers' paradise with many malls owning from late afternoons to early hours of the morning. Serving the local distributors,  the malls sell clothings and accessories items, has 4-5 floors with occasional late night cafes as well. However these strict rules apply: Purchase of at least 2-3 pieces of the same design, no trying allowed,  paying by cash only.

57,3.0,A love hate shopping experience,"Its a shopholic paradise where there are more than 10 blocks of shopping complex, small shops, outlets including discount department store.  The only problem is its spread over a wide area.  Its advisable to bring a trolley bag if you plan to shop.  Items are cheaper than Myeongdong but you need to walk, look and check prices for what you want to buy.  Very much a love hate experience.  Suggest to start the day shopping and end with evening admiring the LED lights display at Dongdaemun Design Plaza, a stunning visual piece of architecture.", April 2016
58,5.0,Cheap Cheap Cheap!,"Dongdaemun shopping district is a bomb! (according to my wife) I had to drag her outta there in the end because if I didn't she was gonna buy the whole shopping center... she said their prices are unbelievably cheap compare to other shopping centers. If you like to be bumped into by strangers, then this is place for you.. You'll run into a lot of Chinese tourists here... they have so much moola they will buy the whole darn shopping centers. I do NOT like shopping, nor crowded places but I was being a nice husband this night and endure the pain of shopping with my wife... she thanked me afterwards and earned a nice round of golf for being a nice hubby~~ yes!", April 2016
59,3.0,wholesalers paradise,"This differentiate from all the other underground shopping alleys we have been.If you can't find anything you fancy underground, there is a building with many floors and endless aisles where only fabrics are sold, not the finished products. The choices would fill the spectrum of rainbow and beyond!Opposite this block, there is another monstrous building with rows of clothes--kids, adults and Korean costumes, men and women fashion boutiques filled out every floor to the nth degree.Do bargain if you intend to buy in bulk. It is hard to contemplate these hard working Koreans sitting in their little enclosure, competing with everyone else selling similar products. This is where some will stand out with their special attractive collections in this maze, the problem is having time and orientation to discover them because they are  hidden in the labyrinth. My advice is buy it immediately if you like it, for it would be impossible to compare prices and you might not be able to find your way back!Do have a break and enjoy the little food stalls just outside", March 2016

Instead found a house of buttons, a house of ahjumma clothes and a house with about 5 floors of fabric.. If you know the area or are visiting with a korean friend it might be a better experience but for us it was pure agony.. Only good part was finding a modern underground shopping area nearby by accident.", April 2016
63,3.0,Stop and Shop,"After training, our group went to Dongdaemun Shopping Complex to check what it has to offer. Well, it is just an average mall where you can find local and international brands of clothing, footwear, etc. It is just an ordinary shopping mall, for me, where you can buy anything you are looking for.", March 2016
64,3.0,Haggling is allowed!,"I visited Dongdaemun with hopes of finding cheap clothes and souvenirs. While I was not able to find clothes that suit my taste, I was able to buy souvenir items for as low as 3000 won with a bit of haggling involved. If you're looking for hanboks, you'll find a lot of those here.", December 2015
65,5.0,Bargain-hunters Dream,"This is a bargain-hunters dream. You need stamina, cash, and a large shopping bag because almost anything you can imagine is sold in these markets. Brush up on your Korean for 'how much' and 'thank you' and enjoy the whole experience. Traders are not pushy and they are always willing to help. All of the sellers of particular items are in one section: hats, scarves and gloves are all in one area, socks are in another, jackets are in another, furs in yet another. Check opening and closing times - some areas do not open until midnight. Be prepared to walk a lot because the complex is huge. One building had several floors of Christmas decorations - so amazing to walk through.", December 2015
66,3.0,It is a clothing mall mainly for wholesale,"Some of the shops in Dongdaemun Shopping Complex are for wholesale (or in bulk), it might be cheaper to buy from stalks in the street because if you buy only little from Dongdaemun Shopping Complex, the shop keeper might not even want to sell little and they don't necessarily give cheap prices.", January 2016
67,2.0,Disappointed!,"I have visited Myeongdong, Dongdaemum & Namdaemun for my shopping in this trip & found Dongdaemum to be the most disappointing. Maybe it's because I visited the place on a Sunday evening. Most of the shops are closed. Same goes to Pyeonghwa Market as well as the Dongdaemum Wholesale market in the area.The livelier part on a Sunday evening is located at Dongdaemum History & Culture Park station (Exit 13 or 14) rather than Dongdaemun station itself. The malls here are somewhat like Platinum Mall in Bangkok. But shopping here lacks the fun of street shopping available in Namdaemun or the variety of mask and cosmetic shops in Myeongdong. Its target market seems to be the low-mid range customers and bargaining is a must.So drop by if it is on the way and you have available free time to kill. Otherwise, visiting Myeongdong and Namdaemun would be sufficient for all your shopping needs.", January 2016
68,4.0,Inexpensive Shopping Fun,I really enjoyed looking around this larger than ever fashion market area. Picked up some great shoes and boots for little cost. You have to find the treasures though. I found that there were very few tourists. Surprising because there is something there for everybody., November 2015
69,5.0,Massive shopping on a scale hard to imagine,"This is a key complex inside the huge Dongdaemun shopping region, which is block after block of every kind of product.  The small stores (often with actual raw goods to create products) are typically clustered together within a geography - such as lighting, plumbing, clothing, furniture, etc.  This complex is one of the most modern with retail stores as well as restaurants.", October 2015
70,2.0,"Shops, shops and more shops",I personally don't really like this place as I find it abit too messy. But if you are looking for clothings and accessories can visit here. But for me I'll give it a skip if I'm back again., January 2016
71,4.0,Shop. SHOP. Shop,"Yeah this place is nuts. Perfect for ladies who need to get their shopping fix in. First time we visited, we were walking around and I was listening to their public announcement, 'Open until 5am.'5am. Usually I'm on my way to work by then! Doota seems to be the more fashionable building while the rest seem more like the apparel you see at night markets. The prices are not as cheap as we thought at first and it seems to be catered towards the China tourists.", December 2015
72,1.0,"Skip this place, visit Myeongdong instead.","DDM is really overhype. We should have read TripAdvisor reviews first before spending our night at this place.There are a lot of shopping complex around DDM, but most of them sell similar things and is more expensive than Myeongdong, I wonder how they got their reputation of ""budget/ wholesale"" outlet... I also have no idea how these shops can open until midnight or 5am because most of the malls has no crowd at all and is very very quiet! I bought a bag at Myeongdong for 10000won, and a similar one is selling at 25000won at DDM.Since the malls are a huge disappointment, we proceed to look for the famous yellow tents to source for better deals and make the trip worth it. However, yellow tents sells mostly counterfeit goods and a small men's bag can cost 60000won!Save your time and visit other places instead!", December 2015
73,3.0,Totally Disappointed,"We first visited the Pyoung Hwa Clothing Market but most of the stalls were closed.  From those still opening for business, we knew that it was just a local low end shopping mall.  We thus turned to another side where there were many department stores.  Again, no surprises.", December 2015
74,3.0,Numerous departmental stores in one big area,"There are a number of departmental stores in this area, e.g. Lotte Fitin, Dooda, Migliore, Hello APM, Good Morning City, etc.  It will be quite impossible to cover all of them within a short period of time, unless you have a lot of time in hand.  We would normally choose 2 to 3 departmental stores and spent about 2 to 3 hours looking for good bargains.  We arrived in the late afternoon and visited Lotte Fitin and Hello APM specifically for ladies clothings. We managed to buy some cloths ranging from KRW10,000 to KRW30,000.  Don't be afraid to bargain as this is normal in some of the departmental stores.", November 2015
75,1.0,Just another shopping mall strip. Total disappointment!,"First of all, we had this misconception that Dongdaemun is another street market. The area is very confusing. After several rounds of asking different people, and being told different timing of the business opening hours, we finally realised that Dongdaemun area is mainly made up of a street that is lines with a few major shopping malls!!!We went to a few of the malls and were quite disappointed that they do not have much to offer. Doota is totally over rated! There are not much to see or buy. And the prices are not cheap at all. We even went to the whole sale complex just round the corner, mistaking it for Dongdaemun market. And they sell all winter scarves, hats and older women clothes!!. Anyway, I will not recommend this place at all. It's a waste of time.", November 2015
76,1.0,Big letdown,"Don't get confused,  Quantity does not mean either Quality or a good price. Lots of things to buy,  in fact an enormous amount of goods in a smallish area but at a largish price.

78,3.0,insane shopping,"Dongdaemun is a street in Seoul you must visit if you're planning on some crazy shopping. I read somewhere that after 10PM would be the best time to visit so that was the time I went. It was really overwhelming (especially since I just landed in Seoul at 6PM that day) and very crowded! Stick close to your buddies as some of the shopping areas can be confusing to a newbie. If you survive though, you can find some good stuff at affordable prices! :)", February 2015

80,4.0,"""Shop Til You Drop"" Redefined!","I went to this Dongdaemun Shopping Complex during my tour of Seoul, Korea and was faced with this three 6-storied buildings of mainly clothes shopping.  Each building caters to a different shopping class with the building to the far right (facing the buildings) the highest class, designer's fashion to the building on the far left selling the lowest class garments.  The lowest class by no means an indication of it's grade as they are just more common everyday wear compared to the highest class where you would find more dressy styles.

82,3.0,Crazy Shopping!!!,"Like its mentioned by other reviewers, I have same opinion, its not cheap at all.Size is another issue everything is UK size6/8/10. People from other parts of the world are not as lucky as locals here. They need to keep the up sizes as well for tourists.It’s like the whole building corner has something or the other to sell.Its fun!", August 2015
83,4.0,One of the great shopping paradise in Seoul!,"it is one of the main shopping mall in Dongdaemun area which offers a lot of women clothing, although not cheap but offer big varieties and it is open til the morning so you can shop all night !

There is a nice cafe and restaurants inside the complex too so you can shop and eat all in one place !The location is great as it is just a few minutes walk from Dongdae mun train station", October 2015
84,3.0,"One of many over-rated shopper's paradise within Seoul, crowded & busy, just OK","We had lunch in one of the many indoor mall's food court upstairs & then allocated time to do some (windows) shoppping - we picked the mall with ""least expensive"" goods and realized that we can find better quality goods in the US for 50% less, even after haggling the prices down using calculators, as many of the sole store/counter sales people do NOT speak little, if any ,English at all - some are just rude & not friendly to tourists, no smiles or thank you.  Many of the same indoor stalls selling basically the same generic products, souvenir items and shoes/sneakers & luggage sets, etc. - if they won't accept for your counter-offered prices, keep walking & buy elsewhere. It's a neat & safe place to hangout on a rainy day and one can spend 2 or 3 days going from block to block, checking out different places & there are places to sit, clean restrooms & food with prices to match all budgets - plan ahead & have a local map. It's just one of those - been there, done it and had one's pictures taken for memories.And, the indoor malls don't have free WiFi that we can readily sign into - fine for the locals but for visitors, NOT good for business & we didn't come across any McD's or Starbucks, plenty of local equivalents - of course.", September 2015

88,3.0,Several malls but pointless,"There is Doota, Lotte Fitin, 3 cheap malls (Miglori, Hello APM, and Good Morning City), and across the street, there is Maxtyle, and plenty of wholesale malls. I only enjoyed visiting Doota and Lotte Fitin. These two provided nice quality clothing with affordable prices. In Doota, there is a food court with several dining options for a quick bite. The other malls were horrible. Poor quality with rude service.When visiting Migliore, in the men's section on floor B1, across from hair accessories, look out for a rude young Korean guy. I don't know why he even has stalls. When I asked him if he worked there when they opened, he said no and continued to run off. Later during the day, I asked him again and he said yes rudely as he was accompanied by his girlfriend. He was acting like I was bothering him. Please close down your stall if you're not willing to sell your items. However, upstairs, there is a souvenir shop across on the right side as you come up the escalators. Sweet and helpful older guy with affordable souvenirs. The wholesale malls across the street were pointless. Bags and bags on the floor with obstructed pathway. Many purchasing were other retailers from other cities. I pictured Dongdaemun shopping area differently before I visited. It didn't meet my expectations. Not even comparable to Thailand shopping experience.", September 2015
89,1.0,Overpriced and lots of haggling required,"If you do not like to haggle over overpriced clothes, AVOID this area at all cost. Not worth going at all. You get better prices for the same clothes without haggling at other shopping areas. More for wholesale suppliers.", June 2015

91,4.0,Shop til you Drop,"There are several buildings in this area. Each building consists of several levels with various goods to buy. If you have much time to spend here you can check up those buildings one by one, but if your time is just short then you can choose one and explore it. You can try Migliore or Good Morning. There you can find Korean made goods with good price, of course if you have a good bargaining skill, which is a must for a real spender :)You can find clothes, accessories, souvenirs, shoes, and many more. But if you are African or European or to put it simply if you have a bigger posture then normally Asian has then don't put your expectation too high. It is very difficult to find big size here. I have a little bigger shoe size then Korean. My size is like 245-250 (Korean size in mm) and they consider it as a big size. My African friends and some Asian-European friends can't find anything with size here. So just be prepared if your size is a big size.If you are staying for a long time here, you can even order shoes or clothes that you want when the sellers run out of your size. Please check the standard price for everything with some Korean you know before you go, so you can make a good deal here. Happy shopping! ^.^", August 2015

We love to go down at night to see the lights but if you really want to shop go during the day, starting about 10 AM. Plan to kill a full day here.

Everywhere you can bargain, even if they say you can't bargain you can. Tell them you want to buy 2-3 items and then tell them the new price for all 3, then change say you only want 1 item and tell them lower price. All places will give you discount for cash as well so that they don't have to pay taxes. There are a few different buildings all selling clothes, some are very cheap with everything around 10-20k others have most things like dresses going for 30-60k (after bargaining).", August 2015

There are here the traditional markets and very modern and popular shopping centers as well. And since it shortly became a popular shopping and tourist destination, it is properly indicated as Special Tourism Zone. The masses of people are going here in all directions, making the impression of some human hives,  gazing at the products and purchasing them. And those products range from silks and fabric ,over the clothes and shoes, leather goods, sporting goods, then plumbing and electronics, toys, luxury watches, and food areas, specialising in Korean cuisine. The choice is really abundant one.We, in the group, had been in this paradise for buyers, several times and every time enjoyed.", September 2014

99,2.0,Meh!,"I think Dongdaemun is overrated... The malls are floors and floors of rows and rows of nearly identical clothes. Now that I think about it, It's quite similar to Platinum mall in Bangkok. The clothes styles were not to my liking, the quality isn't great, and the prices aren't very cheap! You have to bargain..once you find something you like, the storekeeper will enter the price on a calculator and hand it to you.. you enter your 'preferred price' and hand the calculator back..you go to and fro a few times until you arrive at the lowest price they are willing to sell at. I think this is a waste of time, are there really people out there who 'enjoy' this bargaining process? @_@Although it's great that some malls are 24 hours, if you really shop until the wee hours, you have to taxi back to the hotel which will cost you a fortune.Overall I think it's more suitable for wholesale/ people who operate clothing stores overseas to purchase their inventory.", April 2015

105,4.0,Tips for a shopping area ladies must visit when in Seoul,"Dongdaemun is a huge area with many buildings selling mainly clothes for ladies. The few buildings often visited by travelers are:1. Lotte FITIN: my favorite, it even provides free wifi. You can process your Global Tax Refund on 8th floor, that will save you some time in the airport.2. Good Morning City: not many shops open. There is a popular Korea sauna/spa called Sparex which is worth visiting. Try the body scrub.3. Hello apM4. Migliore: good shopping5. Doosan Tower: Korean local designers clothes, merchandise here are more expensive-Typical operating hours: 10:30am - 5am, best to visit after wholesale market opens full swing at night, from ~10pm. Some places are closed on Mon/Tue.- Quality of the clothes vary. Compare prices before buying as you may see some clothes repeated at other shops. Bargaining in expected (up to 20%), also ask if there is discount if you pay cash.  Note that some shops don’t allow trying.- There are many eateries/street stalls selling.  Try 1 of the grilled meat joints, specialty for Korea.- Dongdaemun Design Plaza, DDP is a unique architecture designed by world renowned architect, Zaha Hadid, DDP.

After a while everything starts to look the same and you find yourself overwhelmed with items.

I found it to be quite expensive for the quality of clothing and it wasn't even name brand. While not a complete waste of time to check it out, don't expect to walk away with cheap bags of items either. Be prepared to haggle well.

There's a Tourist Information booth on the main street, and they helped us there to find a store that sells souvenir plates.One thing that is beautiful there and will appeal to non-shoppers too is the Dongdaemun Stadium.

If you are visiting stalls that don't display price tags on merchanise, the asking price is normally doubled that of what they really want, so bargain by offering only 50% of the asking price and walk away if the stall owners refuse.

Surprisingly the owner and employee of this shop can speak Indonesian fluently. They also accept Indonesia USD and Won currencies. The prices is the cheapest compared to other shop in Myeongdong. If we purchase 10 pcs of any souvenirs then we will get 11 pcs, 1 is for free.In this shopping center we also can buy for local designer clothes, but the price is more expensive if compared to those of global designer brands.

In addition, inside the building, in spite of the air con, it gets extremely busy, sticky and claustrophobic, with people constantly shouting (it seems that they are unable to speak in a normal tone of voice) and pushing you around.

Many of the vendors are selling exactly the same stock and the variety of clothing and accessories was not  great and the quality not impressive.Having said that, there are much more choices available for female fashion and accessories, and I did not visit all the markets in the area so could have missed something really good.If you haven't been to a place like this before it is worth a quick visit. There are a lot of food vendors around the locality and, if you fancy a bit of culture there is a good cultural centre and exhibition space just opposite Doota.", August 2014

If you are tight on the budget - look through the onSale racks - $10,000 items are equally good!Some store owners are impatient - when you look through their sale items n keep on asking the prices - they will start folding all the items you looked through n seem not want  to sell to you - hahahha - I bit rude I think- but that's how they are- prideful people.Lots of places to eat too!", May 2014
131,5.0,Shopaholics' Paradise,"If you are a shopaholic, pick a hotel within this area so you can easily return to the hotel in the wee hours of the morning, or return to the hotel to keep your stuff, and then go out shopping again.Though some shops opened earlier, I would recommend visiting this place from 7pm onwards. Most shops only closed at 2-4am. The place is clustered with malls meant for retailers and consumers. If you are not a retailer, you can get great bargains at Good Morning City, APN and Migliore. Make sure you bring cash as you pay cheaper by cash instead of credit card. There are 2 higher-end looking malls nearby - Doota and Lotte Fitin which accepts credit card. There are cafes / food courts in both Doota and Lotte Fitin. Lotte Fitin closes earlier than the rest of the malls. I like Migliore the best among all as they have better clothes designs. You can get clothes on sale from KRW4,000 onwards. New designs are more expensive at KRW30,000 onwards. You can try the clothes / pants but there are no fitting rooms. You might be tempted to buy flashy shoes at these places (Good Morning City, APN and Migliore) but they don't feel that comfortable to wear. I got a similar looking pair from Doota instead at KRW78,000 with better lining. Some flats (shoes) sold at Good Morning City, APN and Migliore are comfortable though and costs only KRW10,000. Migliore was closed when we were there on a Monday while Good Morning City and APN were opened. On Tuesday, Migliore was opened but Good Morning City and APN were both closed. Not sure if this is the norm. In any case, when either malls were closed, there are still may vendors selling clothes / shoes / bags outside these malls. The quality / workmanship of items sold here are excellent. I bought some clothes here 2 years ago and after many washes they still look new.

I would prefer to just shop here.I will say that a lady who sold me clothes a couple years ago recognized me, and even gave me the (almost) same deals as before.

134,3.0,Mishmash shopping experience,"Located next to JW Marriot, this complex mainly houses stalls selling fabrics, ribbons, lace, and bedsheets etc.  To be honest, there are better options, including the underground passage near Dongdaemun subway.   For jewellery etc, you should go over to Doota or Migliore.  My wife loved these two places so much that we were there for two hours while she browsed and bought several pieces.  I must admit some of them are good, but still a little prices.   But do not leave the area without visiting the Dongdaemun Design Centre across the road.  It's a fantastic building in terms of architectural aesthetics, and also houses a design museum, a lounge and several lovely displays of furniture and plants etc.", April 2014
135,3.0,Lotte fashion mall and beware of taxi touts after midnight,"I like Lotte fashion mall (the last mall along the street if you start from Doota). It sells a lot more unique fashion clothing that are designed by the locals. Prices are not at the lowest range but they are reasonable, considering the quality is better too. Train service ends around 12am, so be sure to catch the last train otherwise it will be a pain getting home because all the taxis suddenly become touts and will not go by meter. They want to ridiculously exorbitant rates (50,000 won just to go apgujeong where my hotel is, which is like a 10-15mins ride! That's my taxi fare from incheon airport to apgujeong). Thank god the tourist information center nearby is still opened so I went there to find help. That's when the staff told me that there's a nightbus service N13 that goes to sinsa station, which is the closest to my destination (my hotel is in between sinsa and apgujeong). I had to walk a little bit from the station but better than paying 50,000 won! The nightbus cost just 2,000 won.If you are staying somewhere else, suggest you ask the staff in tourist center which nightbus service is heading towards the direction of your hotel, then drop off at the best bus-stop and grab a cab. Taxis at anywhere else goes by meter, it's just touristy places like Dongdaemun that have all these touts.", April 2014

So, better yo sleep during the day otherwise it will be a struggle against your eyes..!!", December 2013
139,4.0,Shopping for local brand garments,Doota Mall is located in Dongdaemun area along with Dongdaemun market where you can get things at a cheap price if you have good bargaining skills. If you are not good at bargaining. You could go to mall directly. The whole mall embraces all kinds of garments from local brand. The girls would love this place and spend several hours on shopping. You can also find some food from food court area in B1. Actually it's better to taking a break than taking a meal., December 2013

Found the shop at 2FL (near esclator) , Bargain from KRW80K to KRW60K.There are a few priced at KRW45K (special promotion) We bought a few hair piece at KRW3K... As it is winter most of the shops sell only winter clothing,Prices are cheaper than Malaysia .Most shop open till wee morning", November 2013
141,4.0,A day of shopping,"Also known as “Doosan Tower”, Doota Mall is located in Dongdaemun (the East Gate of old Seoul) along with the popular Dongdaemun market where you can get things at a cheap price if you have good bargaining skills. We were not that adventurous that day so we decided to just hang out at the mall instead.After alighting at the Dongdaemun subway station, it was not that hard to locate Doota’s bright orange logo. The Dongdaemun area is akin to Bugis Street in Singapore, bustling with activity(cafes, restaurants, eateries and the like) and people out for a good bargain: having a market (within the vicinity) with makeshift stalls selling their wares (and even some bargaining to boot).Doota Shopping Mall consists of 10 floors, has high ceilings with mostly natural lighting (in the day) with cafes galore. To get to the 1st floor, you can enter through the entrance located there or simply take the escalator outside to get to B1. We started from B1 and made our way up. We spent the whole day in the mall exploring all the shops and  trying to control buying things on impluse (which was pretty much almost next to impossible). Do check out my blog for more on the shopping experience at Doota and photos! ^^", May 2013
142,3.0,Some bargains to be found but beware of the taxis!,"A lot of the stuff is the same and you do need to shop around and try to bargain. I found it is cheap compared to where I live but maybe it's average price for Korea, I've found some similar stuff cheaper around ewha and Myeongdong. We spent a lot of time here anyway and left around 2am.Since the subway was closed we had to get a taxi home, I wish we had done more research on the price! The guy started a speech on how all the subways and buses had stopped and now the taxis have a surcharge, which is true. He said 40000 won but he will do it for 30000 so we said ok since it is cold and we just wanna go to sleep. Again this price would be ok where we are from. This guy drives so dangerously and just drops us near the street our hotel is on. We find out later the trip should have cost maybe 10000 at the most. There are some stories online on other people getting ripped off worse than us by taxis outside so please check online before you get a taxi", November 2013
143,4.0,Amazing shopping,"Visited Dongdaemun on a very rainy day. This complex is enormous - the building we were in was 1km from end to end. The floor we were on was mainly for clothes and accessories for the more mature. There was a huge selection, and the clothes were very well made and cheaper than the UK. There is another building selling items for the young. You can certainly spend the whole day shopping there and it is easily reached on the metro.", November 2013
144,5.0,"You Can Get Really Affordable ""Made In Korea"" Clothes Here!","I love Dongdaemun since it's a major hub for Korean fashion.  Since Korea still makes a lot of its clothing (i.e. not all outsourced to China), you will find affordable, stylish and WELL MADE pieces.I highly recommend you go to the ""Doota!"" building where they have entire floors dedicated to womens/mens fashion and accessories.  In the basement, there is an alteration service and if I recall, they charge 6 dollars for a hem.  They can do these in an hour or so. On the top floor, there is a food court - with one of the vendors notably selling katsu curry.  There is also a Burger King, a crepe place, and Korean food among others.", November 2012
145,1.0,Sale girl with very bad attitude - Doota,"we went to the shopping place in Dongdaemum on our first day at Seoul. we took quite a while to find the way to the shopping centre. when we finally found our way there and enter into the Doota shopping centre, we were greeted by this very rude staff. we wanted to look at the clothes but the moment we took up the shirt, one of the female staff asked us to put it down in a very rude manner. it was really a bad experience for us, we will not go back to the place again.", September 2013
146,4.0,for 24 hour shopping people,"this place is near from Dongdaemun Gate, we arrived 1 am in the morning at Doota and amazed that still shopping mall open and many shopper from around the world is gathering here. from fake to original brand you can name it is available and the most interesting is Seoul young designer in 1st to 3rd floor ! but before you buy anything just make sure you walk around and ask the price from the same product :p the price some time a lot different from one store to another even with the same style and product so be smart :) in 5th floor is the palace for wallet and souvenirs, many souvenirs shop seller speak some south east asian and russian language, might be because so many Indonesian , Malaysian and Russian travels to Seoul. In the ground floor the collection seem stuck in the 80's ;p so if you want to have the Korean K PoP star may be 1st to 3rd level is your floor :) if you bored to shop inside mall just get out and so many stall selling product from cosmetic to fashion :) finally we out from this shopping mall at 4 am in the morning and still wonder why so many people still came and go from this mall like never sleep ;p", October 2013
147,5.0,Wife loved it,"Great place to buy local designed fashion items, wife purchased a bit within the shopping complex. You could shop all day, caters for everyone of all ages. Products are priced well, don't expect the major brands like LV etc....", April 2013
148,5.0,One place to buy souvenirs,"After I went to some places, I found out that this place sold souvenirs the cheapest one. There were 2 main souvenir shops at level 5 inside the mall. The seller amazingly could speak Bahasa. Maybe because many Indonesia or Malay people also shop there. No need to bargain but in the end, the cashier would give directly a discount.", January 2013
149,2.0,Look around before buying,"Went to Doota which is recommended even by the korean tourism board. I had expected that since it is more upmarket and it boasts to be a designer-wear complex, i would get value-for-money kind of clothing. I didn't mind paying if it's a designer-wear. Hence, I paid krw $89000 for a dress. However to my surprise, I saw the same dress made with the same material but with a different label going for just krw $65000 1 floor below. Oh my gosh! So much for a tourist complex that boast of designer-wears and do not allow bargaining! It felt more like mass-production. The consolation was that the salesgirl was willing to give us back the price difference between the 2 shops: something that probably would not happen in other places. By the way, the same dress was selling for krw $50000 in the building just across the busy main road. Lesson to be learnt: Do try to look around and compare prices before buying clothes in the area. You are bound to find the same piece going for different prices. And don't be tricked by the word 'designer-wear'.", July 2013
150,1.0,"RUDE sellers
Get ripped OFF here","I am Korean by descent. I have never felt so embarrassed about my own people and culture. The sellers push you to try things on but when you don't buy, they get pissed. Some shops don't even let you try things on! They claim it will stretch out. In addition, everything is one/free size. Unless you are size 0/2, forget buying anything here. You think you are getting a bargain? Think twice. Doota is a shopping Mecca for many tourists. It might have been a bargain at one point in history but not anymore. They cater to tourists that flock to Korea to shop. They have raised their prices. I can get better prices in the US at the TJ Maxx, Marshall's or Last Call Neiman Marcus. Everything in Korea is made of polyester. I do think the workmanship is good but not the material used. If you want anything leather, prepare to pay. Most shoes I tried on below 10,000 won were not leather and they were made in China. I'm sorry but don't waste your time. You pay for quality. Anything I liked were well over 10,000 won. The floor I liked the most was the basement floor with the small local designer shops. Still pricey but at least you got unique one of a kind items. If you still insist on visiting, good luck! Take cash, you can bargain with cash and do not expect customer service if you are just going to browse.", June 2013
151,4.0,Textiles and traditional clothes,This place is the one to go if you want fabric for traditional costumes or just fabric in general.

153,5.0,Late Night Shopping Madness,"If you are into clothes/shoes/accesorry shopping then this is probably one of the best places in Asia for shop till you drop.  No other city caters to shopping in the wee hours of the morning like Dongdaemun.  Most malls start getting ready around 8pm and things kick off around 10pm all the way until 5am in the morning.  Wholesalers from around Asia come here to get the latest in Korean fashion.  Even if you are not a shoppaholic, this place is still worth seeing the surreal scene of young women hauling duffel bags and the wholesaler system they have with long-distance buses.There are 2 parts to this area.  The popular malls like Doota that many of the Chinese tour groups follow, and then the other side of the street where there are a series of malls that cater to the young hip crowd looking for the latest Korean styles.  Many young women run their own brands here hoping to make it big.  Of course you also get your ""fake"" stuff which is par of the course anywhere in Asia.Last subway train from the station here is about 12:30am so was our nightly stop before calling it a night to our hotel.  It is about 3 subway stops from Lotte Department Store and on the circle subway route.  There are some of your typical night snack stalls here.", May 2013
154,3.0,Basically large complexes with loads of stalls,It's like Sungai Wang in Malaysia just with many many more buildings. There are like 4 or 5 tall buildings with shops in them. Most of them are catered to wholesale businesses only so don't bother going into them unless you want to look around. It can get pretty busy in those wholesale areas. It'll only make you sad as the stuff they sell are really nice and cheap but you can't buy them unless you buy a few of them. I'd recommend Hello apm and migliore. These are the non-wholesale ones. Do take note of when they are closed for business. Loads of clothes though can be quite repetitive. Be sure to bargain!, April 2013
155,3.0,Need Patience and Stamina to find good buys,"You have not been to Seoul if you have not been to Dongdaemun Shopping area. Most tourists come to Dongdaemun for shopping at night as it's open till wee hours (like 5am) in the morning.  There are actually 2 sections of Dongdaemun shopping complexes. The section that most tourists visit are located on the side of Doosan Tower, such as Yes APm, Migliore  and housed small retailers. The other section, nearer to the Dongdaemun Stadium is meant for wholesalers. If you have a few friends and would like to buy a few pieces together, then you should visit malls like Designer Club, Migliore Valley which you can probably spot better buys. I do find that the fashion at Dongdaemun a bit too young for me. I read that Jeil Pyeonghwa caters more to working ladies in 30s-40s.You do find some good buys here but you need patience, and good stamina as you really need to browse through the shops slowly. With every shopping mall with almost 10 levels, it would definitely require some stamina and patience. Another tip is to look out for stall owners who are genuine in doing your business and you can get some good bargains. You would definitely encounter some who are not so friendly, but there are also gems to be spotted.

156,4.0,Just the books.,"Went here because shopping was supposed to be cheap but not really. Yes there were a lot of things to see but I was really surprised that some items sold here I can get cheaper if I go somewhere else in Seoul. Like clothes, a lot here but more expensive than the ones in boutiques in Samcheongdong. Mobile cases were more expensive here than in Insadong. I also didn't like the sellers. They get easily irritated when they're asked questions about the products they sell.What I really enjoyed here was the strip where they sell 2nd hand books. The sellers don't mind if you look around and rummage through the books, in fact they encourage it. They'll tell you to look for what you like and they'll give you a pretty descent price if you decide to buy anything.Will definitely go back here for these bookstores.", September 2012

159,4.0,All women love to come here!!!,"Oh yes, tonnes & tonnes of shops. But do you know that those shops that directly line the walkway have plenty of customers browsing through & thus, the staff are not willing to lower the price for you??? Besides, their customer service skill is lacking. I tried browsing at a few shops & this was what I found out, so I intentionally walked to a shop whose shop front does not face the crowded walkway. And guess what? The staff was friendlier & more willing to please customers. I managed to haggle & get a lower price for my Korean style dress.If you come in winter, the shopping complex switches off its air conditioning. So it was really warm & stuffy inside. And it is very inconvenient to walk around carrying your jacket should you choose to take it off as you will want to touch & hold your must-buy items.Do take note that you cannot try on the clothes here because they are afraid that your make-up will ruin their clothes. So you can only put the clothing in front of your body & estimate the fit.Do note that not every item here is made in Korea. Just like in AU, a lot of the items are made in China. So don't think that just because you bought xxx here, it must be made in Korea. Don't be carried away by shopping euphoria & READ the label.", March 2012

So please compare before buying!You can do some haggling.Female clothing are generally on the cheap to affordable range.Whereas, clothing for men are more expensive. If you go and notice, the stalls selling men clothing do not put any price tag. They kind of hike up the price once they know you are a foreigner. Hence please haggle if you can!My BF bought a simple long sleeve shirt for around 25,000won from Migliore and then when we went to Goodmorning city, the same design, same material, same size is going at 10,000 won.Overall, both of us love this place.", October 2012

162,5.0,the one major market so far where we want to go back to buy clothes,"as a foreigner living in Korea and visiting several of the famous market/shopping areas, we often see things that are interesting and might be neat to buy, but so far we hadn't come across any one particular place where we immediately thought ""oh, we should do our clothes shopping here.""  Until Dongdaemun.  Dongdaemun is similar to some of the other huge famous markets like Insadong or Namdaemun, but different.  It's the one place so far that seemed to carry a huge selection of modern clothes similar to what all the Korean people are wearing.  The Dongdaemun area actually consists of a bunch of huge multistory shopping malls surrounded by the tiny little back alleys full of restaurants and street food vendors and street stalls selling clothes as well, so you can get all the fancy name brand stuff and clean restrooms inside the big buildings and then go find whatever kind of restaurant you want and on the way pick up fuzzy socks or hats or fake Louis Vuitton ties or handbags from the street stalls.Some of the other markets, like Namdaemun in particular, seemed to also have a big selection of the fake name brand handbags and wallets and so on, but you can get all the same stuff here at Dongdaemun.  Also, Dongdaemun is evidently open late into the night.  And I have heard that Dongdaemun is where a lot of businesses much farther outside of town buy their stuff wholesale; for example you can go to shops in Uijeongbu or Dongducheon and see the exact same shirts and jackets and pants and shoes for sale for 100,000 to 150,000 won that you see in Dongdaemun for like 30,000 to 50,000 won.  Just as an example, your mileage may vary but that's what it seemed like to us.  The street food seemed to have it's own particular unique quality as well; we definitely saw some of the same rice dumplings in spicy sauce for example that we've seen elsewhere, but they seemed to have certain particular things here that we didn't see at the other markets, like a giant ball of french fries welded together on a stick with a hot dog in the middle.   In other words, try to check out all the big markets because they all have their own unique character, but if you can only go one place and you need to buy nice looking modern clothes (albeit sized to fit Korean people), then Dongdaemun is the place to go.", November 2012
163,5.0,24hrs Shopping!!,"Yes, you read that right...24hrs shopping! Shopping in the dongdaemun area has pretty updated fashion plus prices are on the cheaper side. You don't have to waste your precious daytime shopping cuz many of the shops in this area open through the night.

You can also stroll along the Cheongye stream westbound if you like; very peaceful at night.  Just know that Korean fashion style is very different from those in other parts of the world, and make sure you upsize your clothes given the different built if you're not Asian.", October 2012
165,4.0,Some good advise for western men,"You can find fantastic bargins here, It's a virtual shopping paradise for the ladies. The guy's can find it the same way here provided you are built like the average Korean man.... However that's just not the case for most of us westerners and will find a day at Dongdaemun more like a treasure hunt.The best plan of action to find that great bargin for us chaps who weigh in excess of 140 lbs soaking wet is to go with a specific item in mind, say a nice winter coat or jacket for example. This way you only have to bother sticking your nose in the clothing racks where you have a fighting chance of finding exactly what you are looking for... Chances are they will have exactly what you want, you have to look for it, and besides, you have to be here with your wife or girlfriend anyway so you might as well make it a productive day for yourself as well....  It is very ill advised for a western guy to try and just wing it here, The place is just too massive and the lack of larger sizes too frustrating that unless you seriously narrow your focus you are very likely to come away with a happy wife, sore feet, and not a thing for yourself to make it all seem worth while..... talking from experience here :)", October 2012
166,5.0,A must go for Local & Western Retail Therapy,"There are 2 parts to this shopping area, the single level local shops/market and the high rise shopping malls. The local markets are shut by 6pm, so go there earlier in the day and go to the malls later or at night. The local market is the place to shop for bargains. We bought outdoor jackets for $5 & $10 (AUD/US) & even tailored items for the same price. For these bargain items there tended to be one of each, so the hunt was part of the fun and the find made the bargain even sweeter. (Only hard core retail therapists may get my meaning here!) If you want to buy a traditional Korean Hanbok this is the place? You can have an outfit tailored or buy a ready-made one. Prices vary on the Hanbok, but this seemed the cheapest place in Seoul to go. Don't forget to bargain in the markets, especially if you are their first customer of the day. There is a belief that it is bad luck to lose the first customer of the day. Have fun bargain hunting!", October 2012

There are both high end stores and also the economical ones.Tthey lined side by side too one another. Most tourists will be taken here to shop. We went to both the high end and the not so high. High end shop has mostly korean designers and international designer. Some of the malls are in Doosan Tower,Migliore ,Hello apM and Good morning City.The clothings are small in size but very cheap. Cost about S$5 to S$15.Prices are displayed so you can see what they charge.The men's floor does not display the prices . However, T shirt is also about $15 and better quality. The sales person mentioned that because it is Autumn and coming Winter period so less of T shirt for sale.There are floors for bags, jewelleries as well. However, we feel the fake bags are very expesnsive.. like the le sports bags cost $10 in Singapore and it can cost $30 to $40 so not worth. The fake bags though fake do not necessarily carry the brand logo. Guess they fear being caught.;oWe still feel that it is better to buy the real stuff. Do check out where these items are made...some are made in China. We want items made in korea for authenticity.From Ibis, it was about 4 train station away if you take the blue line. Just ask the people and they are very helpful. Taxis are also affordable. Only issue in the evening when malls close, very tough to get a cab.The train goes on till after midnite....so that was good.Do wear comfortable shoes if you are in Korea and ready to shop. One need to walk alot cos it is huge shopping area. The shops here remind me of those at Bugis but bigger and more in quantity.Most sizes are free size but some do have the different sizes.We bought loads of T-shirts. Some of them are really cool.

Tourist, local or age group. So the price different is huge. Have fun to tour around but you will find the stuff they try to sell are mostly similiar after a while, perhaps, major suppliers and dealers are feeding most of these retailers.

If you will have time check out Migliore first before heading to Insadong. I could have save more on my souvenirs if I bought them here. Main problem anywhere in Korea is the language barrier.

True enough, you are able to slash prices by 20-30% off at places such as Miglore and 40-50% at A/PM, i find that it's not a great feeling to shop there. The shop keepers were usually persistent and pushy, and even with the discount, i still feel like i have just been ripped off.In the end, to escape from the hassles of bargaining, we decide to get our stuffs from Doota, where the quality were thought to be better but comes with a higher price tag of course. I bought a trench coat at S$180 and leather knee high boot at S$180 as well. I know it's expensive. However, others were selling the boots at S300 at Doota. I thought that i already got a very good deal! Of course you can get boots at S$80-90 at Miglore and A/PM store for a lower quality. However, when i go to Coex shopping mall near my hotel, my heart dropped. I could easily get a better quality coat at the same price or boots at cheaper price. I never feel so ripped off in my entire life!All in all, i'm not sure if this is true only for winter clothing, you can easily get good ones at reputable shopping complexes over there.

But hey all the malls open past midnight so u can literally shop ALL NIGHT!!Apm which is next to doota allows bargaining and if u are good, u can slash the prices by a lot. The trick is to start ur asking price low but don't go too far as the shop owners do get a little peeved. But on the average, we were able to slash prices by as much as 40-50% so u never know!Also, u have to note the days certain malls are closed. For instance, the shoes market closes on Tuesdays. Better check the days these malls are closed or it might just be a wasted trip down. But then again, not so as u can always MALL HOP. It's one of the best places to shop in Seoul!", December 2011
181,4.0,Too Big! one day wont enough,"i just accompany my girlfriend who love shopping. so tired!! this market just too big, yes there are lots of great stuff. my advice is do not bring your girlfriend who love shopping to come to this market, otherwise, you will spend at least 6 hours walking without a rest because you have to accompany her shopping.", December 2011
182,5.0,AMAZING SHOPPING MECCA !!!,Where else in the world you could find shopping malls close at 5 am EVERY DAY except Sunday?! Only in Dongdaemun Seoul. As amazed as we are seeing people still really DOING shopping at 3 am and it is busy despite it is an early morning of working weekdays. A must for buyers or shopaholics wannabe., October 2011
183,5.0,Mecca for those looking for fabrics and craft products!,"I nearly hyperventilated when I visited the Dongdaemun Shopping Town! I was at first wondering if I would be able to get what I want for sewing small bags as gifts for friends. It's a white building with 5 floors full of fabrics for traditional Korean costumes and quilts and as you go higher, there's there you find fabrics by the bales and you can buy a yard/ yards of anything you fancy... Of you can buy fat quarters of fabrics which are already cut and displayed. Bring heaps of cash as I did not see any credit card facilities.I consider myself a pretty good bargainer, but it was tough negotiating with the shops. They would throw in a free yard of fabric lying around, but don't count on too much discount.  There are so many shops selling lace, zippers, and all sorts of stuff you need as hobbyists or serious sewers. Exit Dongdaemun subway stop and head towards Exit 9.", November 2011
