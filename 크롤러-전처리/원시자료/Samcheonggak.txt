0,5.0,Lovely Grounds after a Nice Hike,"I decided to take the bus to get to this place on a very early Saturday morning.  Just a one bus transfer from Gangnam.  There is actually a shuttle service, however, I was not sure of the actual location of the pick-up points.  Its best to have a wifi cause google maps can lead", May 2019

10,4.0,Charming venue; a slice of Korean history,We had a group event. The food was decent. Venue was fantastic. Entertainment was first rate. Great for large gatherings. So near Seoul but so high up and surrounded by greenery., May 2016
11,4.0,A quiet retreat,"If you want to experience a good quality Korean banquet meal in peace with a great view then this is a good place. The prices are a little high but the service is good and the variety and volume of food is very good. January is not the best time for being outdoors at minus 15 so the main activity was eating, followed by a quick walk around the premises. The view is good. There are tables that can see the view but we chose an interior table. Needless to say, you should like Korean food!", January 2016
