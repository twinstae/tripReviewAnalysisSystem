0,4.0,A must hike,"The hike was quite easy even if you're not much fit (but you will need to stop dozen times aling the way). The scenery was great, you can observe the Namsan Tower from far, the Bukhansan Mountain, the Blue House. Start off from  Gyeongbukgong station, take bus 7020/1020/7022 to", December 2019
1,5.0,Good workout!,"I didn't find this in a must-visit list, but since I was 3 weeks in Seoul I decided to explore it. Google it, and you can get information from travelers who'd been there, including which subway exit, and very detailed directions to start your climb. There's an amazing almost 360 degrees view of Seoul. The climb consists of wooden stairways and on some dirt tracks. There is military installation on this mountain where you are not allowed to take photos. Past the military installation and there is your last 500 meters sprint to the highest peak at 338 meters above sea level. I even climbed it twice!", November 2019
2,5.0,Iwangsan Hike,A great hike and not too difficult. We took The Fortress Trail as well from close to the top of Iwangsan. To get there take the train to Dongnimmun and then take the Muak-dong exit. Just follow the road uphill until you see the Iwangsan trail sign., November 2019
3,5.0,The Perfect Hike in Seoul,"This is the best hike you can do in Seoul. The hike is mild challenging and it will only take 2-3 hours to complete both ascend and descend. If you’re fit, you can complete it quickly. For me, weighing at 108kg, I managed to reach the top regardless. Bring 1 liter of water and some snacks to enjoy at the top. The entire hike is mostly full of steps so, it’s pretty straightforward. And you can get the best views of Seoul. It’s a rewarding experience, especially for those who seldom hike.", October 2019
4,5.0,Fantastic hike,Fantastic hike with stunning views in all directions. There are rest points at a few places. Do not advise if have knee or back problems as can be steep on places. But if get to the top... well worth it., June 2019
5,5.0,Pretty fun and intense hike ,I hike a lot and found this a mild challenge. Lots of elevation as the entire thing is up stairs with each step and same on the way back. Bring a at least 1 L water per person on a hot day if you plan to do the whole ridge. You can see how far Seoul expands in all directions., June 2019
6,5.0,Impressive mountain hike within the city boundaries,"If you don't want to take on the more challenging Mount Bukhansan, Ingwansan Mountain is a great alternative. But be warned, it's still a serious workout! I took plenty of rest breaks on the way up.The hike to the top and back down can be achieved in 2 to 2 1/2 hours, even if you're a bit slow. But you do need to be reasonably fit - there are a lot of steps on the way up, and a rocky path descending. I've noticed someone saying the trail is hard to follow, which I did not find to be the case. Simply follow the old city wall up and down, and you won't get lost. If you're doing this hike alone, as I did, be aware that there aren't too many people on the mountain (which is a good thing!), so take a mobile phone, plenty of water, and a jacket in case the weather turns. On a hot day it's a hot walk. Very windy at the peak. Nevertheless, a steady trickle of other hikers will pass you, so if you do have problems you should still be able to ask for help. If you're getting about on public transport, take the Metro to Geongukgung Station, Exit 3, and take a bus number 7212, 2010, or 7022. Get off at Jahamun. Cross the road and you'll see a path leading up to the right, that takes you to the old city wall. Follow these steps to the peak, then continue to follow the trail down the other side. You'll come out amongst a lot of apartment buildings. Walk down the winding road for a bit, find the steps that go down to the main road, and you'll be near to Dongnimmum Station where you can take a train back to the city. Make sure to wear sturdy footwear, but no specialist hiking equipment was needed when I went.", May 2019
7,3.0,Confusing trails... Nice view of Seoul,"The trails are poorly marked. It took us quite a while to find the trail head and even after we got to the trails, we couldn't find out way to the top and.... at one point, we walked into an area that's locked.... I still have no idea how did that happen.  Anyhow, we think we managed to take a couple good shots of Seoul from inwangsan.", February 2019
8,5.0,"Awesome climb, beautiful autumn flowers","Inwangsan was a great walk - we headed up from Dongnimmun, past Seonbawi and then connected to the City Wall and followed it back down. Beautiful flowers by the wall on the way back down with panoramic views stretching from the Blue House, over Gyeongbokgung to N Seoul Tower. We easily fit our tip into a morning's excursion from the Namdaemun area. Didn't see any of the security guards or 'no cameras' signs others have mentioned but perhaps we did not go high enough (we were satisfied with the views from the city wall and did not reach to the summit).You can take a bus or train to Dongnimmun from central Seoul to the start of the walk. Heading north from Dongnimmun (where you can stop for a photo at Dongnimmun Gate) ascend through steep residential streets. Head past a tiger mural and up some steps by a giant bell in a pavilion. Go past a shamanic temple (there was a gut on while we were there) and up to Seonbawi - a weird rock. We headed up to a large rock shelf up from Seonbawi and followed some locals to connect to the city wall route.", September 2018
9,4.0,A steep walk but your reward is great views,"If it is summer, come here as early as possible. It is a steep and sweaty hike up from the metro station. You will pass some shaman shrines, the guide advised against taking photos of the shrines to show respect. One idea is to come here early and visit the prison afterwards. Another idea is to start your walk along the city wall from here, if you do that, bring plenty of water and some snacks (start early).", August 2018
10,5.0,Climbing along the wall. Great sunset. Escape before the night.,"Amazing mountain climbing along Seoul City Walls. Be careful for each step.- Starting from the west (near Muakjae Station or Sajik Park) is recommended for an easy ending(near Changeuimun Gate).- Obviously, this is an easy mountain comparing to others in Seoul. But, still needs to be careful on a rocky mountain. Start to go down before it's too dark. Some tracks don't have lights and they're risky.- Looking around the top near the sunset is beautiful.- 2~3 hours depending on pace. it has almost no shade while climbing. Visiting during summer will require carrying some water. WInter climbing is not recommended for the safety.- Also, there are other places to see on the mountain such as Hwanghakjeong Archery Field, Dangun Shrine, Changeuimun Gate, Sukgulam Temple, Suseonngdong Valley, Mumudae Observatory, etc. Good to visit if you're not in a hurry.- Seoul City Walls connect to Bukaksan Mountain after escaping to the east.", October 2018
11,5.0,The Perfect Hike,"If you adore cities, you need to appreciate them from different angles. Seoul is blessed with an array of small mountains and towers; one has no excuse to see multiple on a trip. I would rate the views from Inwangsan above both Naksan Park and Namsan Tower due to the following:- the sense of achievement upon hitting a summit- being able to see the entirety of Seoul (almost) from one aspect- the fact it hasn't devolved into playground for couplesI went with four friends during a hot afternoon, and the entire hike, from Buam-dong to Dongnnimun took just over 3 hours. Photo-taking did slow us down, but you genuinely should factor that into your calculations. No hiking gear was worn, so don't be put off by the sea of neon colour and clacking of poles flying past - one friend managed the majority of it in sliders, while another was dealing with an infected ingrown toenail!If this is one of your first time to Seoul, get it on your itinerary. If not, you'll probably have regretted not going like I did. So yeah, the perfect hike.", September 2018
12,5.0,Hiking inside the capital city,"Seoul is really hot on summer so we decided to go on hiking since Korean mountains are not that high, especially those in Seoul. It’s easy to access because it is located near the Gyeongbok Palace. The mountain itself is not that high, only 300 meters high, but still has a beautiful view!", July 2018
13,5.0,Mountain in Seoul,The location is just 10 minutes walk from famous Gyeongbokgung palace. It only takes aroung 1 hour 40 minutes to finush the course with the normal speed. Really recomnended for beginner hikers., July 2018
14,4.0,Hike the Trip,"I was marveled by mixed review and I have to say, really..to each their own. So when I receive a last minute prompt from Airbnb of joining their small group tour, guided by Sam an Airbnb Marketeer as well; I dived into it.The walk begin well but got really tedious due to fatigue from the atmospheric pressure. Sights of the old and new build of boulders of past era and new made were presence. Once you were at the peak, gotta get the camera ready as Spring fog will come in by 7pm and darkness seeps in rather quickly altho there were warm lighting around that come ON at 7pm. Coming down hill is a bit of a challenge as the night gets darker and not all walking path are lited or laid nicely so good walking shoes or track-shoes are definite and Wind-Breaker & scarf in Spring-March/ early-April. Fortunately, there are occasional rangers at the park, should there be an emergency or mishap, they could walkie-talkie that summon assistance.Its a hike not to be miss in Seoul.", March 2018
15,5.0,Hiking half day,"Amazing way to get away from the city even though you are still in Seoul.Thus, it was originally built to protect the city, so it's very cultural!A must go place if you're in Seoul!", April 2018
16,4.0,Mist and cloudy winter morning view,"There are many trails to go to the top of the mountain. There are many stairs at the beginning of the climb, but as you progress, the journey will become harder as the trail can be quite steep. Nice workout!! I sweated all over although i hiked it during the winter. In winter, once you reached the top, all you can see is thick mist, so it is not  advisable to climb it during the winter.", December 2017
17,4.0,Relatively easy hike with great views of Seoul,"This is a hike that involves climbing a lot of steps and stairs up to the top.  There is a small section, closer to the top, that is steeper and requires a bit more care, but all in all, this hike can be done in less than an hour to reach the summit.  It is impossible to get lost since you just follow the fortress wall all the way.  The views of Seoul are great!How to get there:Take the subway to Gyeongbokgung station.  From there, take exit 3 out of the station and turn right.  There is a bus stop just after Starbucks.  Take bus #7212, 1020, or 7022, and get off at Jahamun stop.Once off the bus, cross the street onto road where the museum is.  Walk along the path until you get to the first police post.  From there, turn or look to the right for the wooden steps up.  Go up the stairs and follow the fortress wall all the way up.Once at the top, you can backtrack back down, OR, you can descend down the opposite side of the mountain.  Follow the fortress wall (there are some steep areas) until you come to the road and police stop.  Turn right on the road, and follow it down.  After about a 20 minute walk thru a neighborhood, you will come to a main street.  Turn right, and you will see Dongminnum subway station (orange line).Hope these instructions are helpful.  This is a great activity on a sunny, clear morning or afternoon.", November 2017
18,4.0,For all hike levels!,This was fun! You can get great views and good exercise without going to the highest summit. We went as high as we would then found lots of other paths to explore. There are many ways to access this mountain- from steps to paved paths. It was enjoyable and gave us views we’d not seen before., October 2017
19,4.0,Beautiful view of the city and fortress wall,"We read about this amazing hike online and decided to give it a try, as the difficulty level reviewed was ""extremely easy with stairs and marked trail"". As such we went totally unprepared and our mum followed as well. The ascending part was easy with proper stairs but the descending trail was a bit challenging with boulders guided with a rope handrail. We took the fortress/ city wall trail. To get to Inwangsan Mountain, we took the metro (orange line 3) to Gyeongbokgung Station and took a bus at exit 3. Walk straight after exiting and the bus stop is on your right. Take either bus number 7212, 1020 or 7022 and alight at Jahamun Museum stop(bus duration around 10mins).  Cross the road on your left and walk all the way uphill and take the Inwangsan Jarak-gil trail. Upon arriving the police post, cross the road to the wooden stairs. Your hiking trail starts here. As there are no shops or toilet, it is advisable to bring some water and sip when needed. We took about an hour to reach the peak and another hour down (look out for Dongnimum Station after the descent) It should be faster if there are no elderly hiker. There are many nutmeg trees and nutmegs during our hike in the summer. Air was fresh and there are good views of the city. I specially like the fortress wall. It was a very enjoyable hike, despite we wearing the wrong gear.", August 2017
20,5.0,"A must do, for the views","A walk up the mountain, took us 3-4 hours, including rest stops. The incline, which is steep in places, has crude steps that has been cut out of the granite rocks. Nearer the top, a rope handrail is in place to assist at the steep sections that run close by the old city walls. Towards the summit top there is an Army anti aircraft gun placement, Photographing such areas are not allowed, and the police that patrole further up Inwangsan Mountain are there to ensure no photography is done towards the Presidents blue roofed house. Views of Seoul are well worth the effort of the climb up.", July 2017
21,5.0,An alternative view of the city,"Inwangsan Mountain is a fairly accessible hike which gives you amazing views of the city. There's no cost in entering the hiking trails, and is fairly safe to climb solo. My friend and I took an early morning ride (around 5am) to Gyeongbokgung and figured our way up to Inwangsan. The trip wasn't a well-prepared scenario, we are both hiking enthusiasts back home and we figured it wouldn't be all bad to just figure things out as we go, given that Inwangsan has defined hiking trails (with cemented stairs!), exercising locals, and roaming soldiers. There are two options to get to Inwangsan, either by Gyeongbokgung or Dongnimmun Stations and although some advice taking a bus to get to the exact entrances to the peak, the trails are easily reachable by foot, and wouldn't tire you out before the climb. There are several convenience stores along the way, I suggest you pack water and some candy for your climb. It doesn't take long to reach the top, the hike itself is about 45 minutes to the peak but it still will get you thirsty, and maybe low on energy as the climb gets steeper.In some areas there are many locals going about their morning routines and exercise, so it is best to be courteous and observe silence.  The area is also nearby the Blue House so it is heavily guarded, with a station up top. Please remember not to take photos in areas with signages asking you not to, and don't also take photos of the stations as well as the soldiers' faces. They will, at certain occasions, approach you and ask you to delete your shots. The sunrise from Inwangsan is nothing short of amazing, I had a wonderful ""night view"" of the city prior to sunrise and an awesome view of the mountain ranges surrounding Seoul. There are a lot of spots to take photos in at the peak, and you can enjoy the breeze and take a rest before going down.Our ascent was on the rougher part of the course, but there's a leisurely hike up following the famous Seoul City Wall. We took that path going down and got lost again following it all the way through the wall's end and onto a neighborhood. We were however lucky enough to stumble upon the Dongnimmun Gate, which is very much reminiscent of Arc de Triomphe and took another opportunity for photos. We then walked towards the station and back to Myeongdong, where we stayed.If you're looking for offbeat activities in Seoul that don't cost a dime and are pretty much regarded as safe, a trip to one of the peaks in the city makes for a good escape.", November 2016
22,5.0,"Good hike, great views, near subway","No car required: this steep but scenic hike with views over the whole city is very close to Line 3's Dongnimun station. Finding the trailhead is a little tricky. Look for staircases due east of the station, walking between the two station exits on the east side of the road (opposite the prison museum). If you see the city walls, you're headed in the right direction. There are LOTS of steps and some pretty steep bits, but it's worth it.", February 2017
23,5.0,Great for Beginner Hikers,"Coming from Sinchon, this mountain is less than half an hour away by bus. I'm a beginner hiker, hike was relatively easy with a few stops to rest for a bit. Took around 2.5 hours to get to the peak and back, but that really depends on how many stops you take for rest or photography. It's highly guarded, from the mountain the Blue House can be seen. It is not allowed to take photos in that direction.", April 2017
24,5.0,A must-do!,"I was looking to get out of the city-scape a little and fortunately was staying <1 mile away from Inwangsan! Who knew this little hill (let's be honest, it's not a mountain) was so accessible and had such a fantastic view?? I walked from my hotel near Gwanghwamun, but you could just as easily take the purple line to Gwanghwamun station, or the orange to Gyeongbokgung and walk over. Or taxi. I walked up a street ""Inwangsan-ro"" until I saw other hiker-like people and then followed them :) just keep heading up, and you'll get there! I think it was 4 miles roundtrip from my hotel, took me ~2.5 hours as I was walking leisurely and stopped at a couple places on the way back. Worth it!! Better view than N Seoul Tower in my opinion, and way less crowded!", April 2017
25,5.0,Picturesque view on the mountains,"The view from the mountain is really thrilling, though it's very difficult to climb on it. But it's worth it", December 2016
26,4.0,Exploring the beauty of Seoul with an astonishing view over Seoul,"Arriving in Dongnimun, we, my best friend and I found stairs at the left side of the entry. Following the stairs, a small shrine and temple, as well as big stones to pray to appeared. We followed the pathway and with some luck we found ourselves to be at the Namsan wall. We then followed the way all the way till the end. On the mountain, nature provides an amazing view over Seoul. One can see the President House (Blue-roofed house). Finally, we proceeded to go down the wall, which also turned out to be a picturesque place as well. I ended up to be somewhere in the middle of nowhere. But in the end, we found our way to Dongnimun again. In total, I have to say that it is one of the most amazing attraction I have done so far in Seoul. The view is especially picturesque in the autumn and winter, so around October and November. All the small places with a breathtaking view really are my highlights of Seoul, so I very much suggest to bring a camera, to capture these moments. The route is also quite tiring and may not be very appropriate for people with a fear of heights or small children. It is also very windy up there, so feel free to bring a pull-over. Water may also be brought with. What also needs to be considered, is time. This activity takes about three to four hours. Early in the morning, there are not many people around there, but it is much fresher than on the day. Traveller tip: the sunrise and sunsets are absolutely magnificent.", November 2016
27,4.0,Beautiful tracking,Here is one of the mountain where you may enjoy the view of Seoul city. By the way there is two temples and holy rock where the prayers are always avaliable. Be ready to climb high up!, September 2016
28,4.0,Great view. ,Walked up here today. Great view up by the wall. Not sure if I took the best track. Got off metro at Muakjae. Take exit 1 or 2. Narrow street off to the right goes past apartment blocks and the water authority building then on to a track. Came down a different way about 700m further along the main road. Enjoyable hike. I had to use 2 rope ladders. Not many signs and none in English but a good experience., September 2016
29,5.0,Great Place to see Central Seoul,"350m high, 4km long, well maintained and safe  hiking course to see President House, Old Palaces and core of Seoul.  Walk along with castle and see all around of Seoul.  It is beautiful Seoul.  Near this mountain, many famous testaurants. Walking with children is no problem.  If you like temple, visit Temple in the Rock, very small but pesceful.", September 2016
30,5.0,a scenic hike along the great wall in seoul,"it's great to climb a mountain in the heart of the city, short walk (2 - 5 hours depends on which route u pick), great view, but make sure u know how to get there by bus. two idiots jumped onto a cab and the driver didn't understand english, at all. we used google map google translate but could get us nowhere. communication totally broke down. we had to stop the cab and get out in the middle of the road. luckily the trail ran alongside the road! there's a strong military presence so photography is strictly prohibited in most of the places on mountain.", April 2016
31,4.0,seoul from above,"If you have a couple of hours to spare and want to get away from the business of the big city the inwangsan hiking is the answer. It's more a stroll than a hike, but it's extremely pleasant. Hundreds of steps chiselled out from the rocks to make it very approachable to all. The climb is gentle zigzagging through beautiful plants and trees and when you reach the top Seoul is there at your.", June 2016
32,5.0,Inwangsan Mountain,"A very beautiful place! I (16 y/o) did the trip with my father and a friend of his with his nephew.A great place to do mountain climbing, enjoy nature and talk.We started at the bottom and went up, meeting many people relaxing at different stages of the mountain. From the top there is a beautiful view to the city.", June 2016
33,4.0,two different attractions,"Actually, there are two different hills which are quite different, the western side ""Inwangsan"" is not so strictly contolled, althought there are some polices visible, I think you can access that any day you wish, since there are no gates etc. The western side Bugaksan is military area with strict control and cameras every 100 meter. The Inwangsan side is more relaxing and more close to hiking rather than walking path in the Bugaksan. For the Bugaksan a passport needs to be with you to acces the area.", January 2016
34,5.0,Nice hike with beautiful view of Seoul,"The day I planned to climb Bukhansan Mountain, it was closed to public so I decided to climb Inwangsan instead, which was of no regrets. The climb up was a bit tricky as there were many routes up. Please remember to wear hiking shoes and proper hiking clothes as the climb would be a bit challenging. Once you reach the top, you would get a beautiful view of Seoul and the other neighbouring mountains.Mountain recommended for first-time hikers as it was also my first time and this was enough of a challenge but once you've reached the top, the view pays off the climb.", November 2015
35,4.0,Great spot to see city of Seoul,"Put your sneakers on and get ready for hiking if you put Inwangsan Mountain on your list. You need to walk a quite steep path, and climb up. Before you climb to the peak, you'll pass Seonbawi Rock and the Inwangsan temple. To find the way is a bit tricky. I wasn't sure whether I was on the right track because I couldn't see the gate from the big road. You will have to walk pass the apartment buildings before you can see the gate.", October 2015
36,3.0,"Nice view, shame you cant take pictures of it :(","This attraction was hard to find and follow due to many of the signs on the track being in Korean only.  I was very let down by all the ""No Photos of the view"" signs at the top as well as the Police / military watch towers.  I went there for the view!  Take lots of water and a hat!", September 2015
37,5.0,Most breathtaking view of Seoul,"I've been to most of the hills and mountains in and around Seoul, but Inwangsan offers without a doubt the most breathtaking view of the city. The mountain in high enough, close enough to the city, and is rocky at the top, meaning that you won't have trees in the way when gazing at the city. Finding the entrance to the mountain path isn't too easy, which might be the only drawback to this place. It takes one to two hour to go up, and while the lower portions are really easy (gentle slopes, small stairs), getting to the top, where everything gets rocky, can be difficult for kids or people with fairly poor physical condition. But once you reach the top... what a view. You get to see pretty much everything in Seoul, except what's lying directly behind Namsan (Itaewon, parts of Gangnam). But every major building or area of note is visible : Gyeongbokgung, Namsan, Jongro, Seoul Station and Yongsan, all the way to Yeouido and even Mokdong or the World Cup Stadium. On the other side, you might get a perk at Dongdaemun, Seoul Forest, the Lotte World Tower, the Olympic Stadium and Gangnam's biggest buildings - Samsung Town, COEX, Tower Palace, Gangnam Finance Tower). Needless to say, you will also find yourself amazed by the numerous mountains and the Han river. And as an added bonus, you get to walk along the Seoul Fortress Wall. Also, it should be noted that for photographers, the security is at a much lower level than Bugaksan, so you will be allowed to take pictures of almost every thing you can see.This place is better than Namsan tower, cheaper, and with less foreign tourists. And I think it's also better than Namhansanseong because you're actually much closer to the historic city of Seoul.", September 2015
38,3.0,Nice getaway from the city,"The hike up Inwangsan is a nice way out of the city for a few hours.  There are some awesome views of the city and the defensive wall makes an interesting contrast with the modern towers of Seoul.  It has some steep sections, but it is definitely a part of the capital that is less travelled and worth seeing.", April 2015
39,3.0,Closed on Mondays,"You get nice views of the city.  There are a few shrines along the path and a big rock in the shape of a praying Buddha.  To the east, across the city wall, is the presidential Blue House.  The area on the east side of the city wall is closed on Mondays and you have to be on the east side of the wall to get to the top of the mountain (I wasn't able to get to the top).  To get to the hike, you can get off at the Dognimmun subway station and take exit 1.  Go uphill to the right and turn right on Tongil-ro 18 road.  At the sharp turn in the road, head straight through the temple gate up the insanely steep road.  Continue uphill.", November 2014
40,4.0,Great Views of Seoul,"We started at Dongnimmun station.  Go out exit two and head straight to the first street.  At first street take a left and follow it up through the buildings/apartment complex to the trail head.  You will be going uphill.  As you get closer it will get steeper and there will be stairs.  First stop is the shamanist shrine and Seonbawi Rocks.  There is a shrine at the rocks and we worked our way around the rocks and back to the trail that follows the wall up the mountains.  From the Seonbawi Rocks, you can get a view of the Seodaemun prison.  Also around the rocks are various shaman sites with writings over the rocks and as you work your way back toward the wall you will pass numerous shaman sites as well.  We then hiked to the peak and came down another way.  The trail is steep, but we did it with a 10, 8, and 6 year old.  If you do have children be very cautious as there are numerous drop offs.  I carried the two year old on my back.  The views of Seoul are very good so make sure you go on a clear day.  You overlook the Gyeongbukgung palace and can also look north to the Bukhansan mountains. As we came down a different trail we used the Gyeongbukgung subway station to get back.  Due to the mountains location, you can only take pictures in certain directions for security reasons.  Bathrooms were available at beginning and end of the trail.", August 2014
41,5.0,Great hike along a spiritual trail,"Great views of Seoul alongside dozens of temples and shrines where shamanists perform their exorcism. You'll get the daily exercise and your spiritual fix at the same time. You start and end at Donninmum station, but you can choose to ascend and descend the mountain on different paths.", July 2014
42,5.0,Recommended when in Seoul,"A not overly demanding hike that will give you stunning views over Seoul, nature and interesting sights. Beautiful mountain with well maintained trails right in the heart of Seoul. Get off the metro and within minutes you are in pine woods. We started the walk from Dongnimmun station (line 3 - we took exit 1 and followed the signs to Seonbawi rock); this is a good place to start as you get to see the interesting part of the park dotted with shaman shrines, beautiful rock formations carved by the elements and nice views of the city when you climb behind Seonbawi Rock. The walk from Dongnimmun station to Seonbawi rock is a short but steep uphill (follow the trail to the left).  Once you have explored the area around Seonbawi rock you can continue on the rest of the trail to the summit: for this you need to cross to the other side of the wall (on the right of the temple from the steep hill when coming from the station). There is a path that follows the wall all the way to the summit (from the top you get 360 views of Seoul, you will also see the royal palaces). The areas at the top are guarded by military and photography towards the presidential house are prohibited. You can then continue along the wall all the way to the other side of the mountain, and exit in the Buam-dong / Changuimun gate area. On this side we had lunch at a local restaurant a few doors from the Unicef building where we ate Bossam (보쌈) which is a tasty dish of sliced pork. From here you can walk down the main road towards the palace and you will find an interesting street food market (Tonging Market) and Sejong Village Food Street (lots of food to eat around here too). They are both worth a stroll around. Continue down the main road and eventually you will get to Gyeongbokgung station (line 3). All in all a very pleasant day out and good exercise for the legs with all the steps (especially coming down from the top to Buam-dong).", June 2014
43,4.0,Seoul - Shamanist shrine & Buddhist temples walk,"This uphill walk is steep but really rewarding and a great way to get away from the busy city of Seoul - if only for a few hours.  You will see Buddhist temples, a shamanist shrine, and enjoy a great view. Take subway Line 3 to Dongnimmun station - leave by Exit 2 and turn down the first winding alley on your left.  Walk uphill past grocery shops for about 10 minutes and you will see the temple gateway on your left.  If you ask anyone along the way they will be happy to provide you with directions - even if they speak no English.  Everyone knows why you are there and they are happy to point you in the right direction.  Along the way you will see traditional houses and temples with murals that depict the Buddhist way of life.  Eventually you will arrive at the Zen rocks where women come to pray for sons.  A young woman was there when I arrived so I waited for her to finish before looking around.  A big surprise was finding exercise equipment dispersed around the hillside for you to use.  Yes, I'm talking treadmills and stairmasters - very strange! You will see candles, incense, and other offerings set into the hillside as you make your way to the various shrines.  Wear good shoes since the climb is steep and the path can be rocky.", July 2013
44,4.0,Early morning hike,"It was a lovely early morning hike with no disturbances and good views of Seoul. There isn't that much to explore but the fact that it's quiet, very easy to get to from the subway, and gives you a fair workout all put it higher in my esteem.", August 2013
45,4.0,Mt Inwangsan - good walking trail,"In Korea, people love & enjoy their hikes. There are many walking trails around Seoul. This is one of them..How to get there:I was starting from Itaewon subway station (Line 6) to Yaksu station and changed to Line 3 to Dongnimmun station. Came out at exit 2, following signs to Inwangsa temple. Cost of subway (single trip) for 2 adults - 3300 Korean Won. You will get refund (500 Won each ticket) if you return the ticket at the end of trip.Its my second time using the subway, have to say, its so easy and signs are very clear & in English. Its so much more fun then sitting at the back of taxis as you get to explore & see other stuff as you find your way to subway stations.The Walk:No entrance fee. The trail is very well laid out with steps all the way. It gets a bit hard towards the peak as have to climb through some rocks.There are rest areas in between but at certain spots no photography allowed. I could not get good photos that day as it was a very hazy day. I will attach a few once I get them downloaded into my laptop.Good time of the year to visit is May. Temperature range between 17 to 25 degree celsius.Roughly one hour to go up & one hour to come back down. Of course, you can stop longer if you wish to relax more..Enjoy your walk..", May 2013
46,4.0,Mount Inwangsan & the Fortress Walk,"If you are dying to get some hiking on your vacation in Seoul, a hike up Mt Inwangsan provides you just that.The route is actually a section of the Fortress Walk. From the top of Mt Inwangsan you can see Gyeongbokgung palace, etc below. You can start by getting off at Gyeongbokgung Station and exit at Exit 1. Walk towards Sajik Park and Pirundae-ro. From there, there are signboards providing the direction up to Mt Inwangsan. Grab some drinks from the convenient store before making your way up.", May 2013
47,5.0,Seoul's best kept secret!,Inwangsan is truly a treasure in Seoul! The hike itself is relatively easy at a little over 300 meters and the sites are truly rewarding. One of the few places with authentic Korean shaman spirituality!  While hiking I could hear chanting and some unique Buddhist temples. Worth a visit!, October 2012
