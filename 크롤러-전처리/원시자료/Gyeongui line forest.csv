4,4.0,Delightful and buzzing,"We walked part of this this evening, from the Sinchon end into Hongdae and it was a delightful walk. The first part was clearly ex-railway and had been turned into an arty area with various sculpture. Regrettably part way along was blocked by buildings including a new one being built - hope they are building a continuation of the pathway beneath it.Beyond there was a cafe/eating/coffee/designer shops stretch that was really buzzing in the medium warm spring evening. Bet it gets really busy in summerAnd delightful walk", April 2018
5,5.0,Gyeongui line book street,This is a stand out location in the heart of Seoul suitable for different activities. Occasional shows and performances are also common. There is a library in the street and an old abadoned rail road., July 2017
6,5.0,A nice place to picnic (Yeonnam-dong),"Gyeongui line forest park is formed by a few parts and I visited the park in Yeonnam dong (연남동 구간). This place is getting famous around Koreans and foreigners as it is known as a good venue to picnic. There are some grounds for people sit around and picnic. You can see a lot of people sitting on the ground having food and cheers. Around this area, there are many take-away food selling such as steaks, pizza, fries and more! so people can just buy food and snacks easily and enjoy their picnic. We brought our own mat. Those who do not have a mat, no worries because some stores  even provide mat renting service (around 3000won). Then we bought pizza, chicken rice and steak, and purchased drinks from convenient store nearby.  We were eating, chitchatting, laughing and lying around. The environment is very comfortable and romantic. Some people were even having wine. For foreigners, have a picnic in another country would be a unique experience.You can reach Gyeongui line forest park from a few stations, but the most easiest way to reach this Yeonnam-dong area is from Hongdae station. Just come out from exit 3 you can find this place easily.", July 2017
