2,4.0,A pleasure to visit always,"The park is easily accessible by subway (Mongchontoseong Station) on Line 8, near Jamsil. It is a large park with beautiful scenery. The best is to go there in the afternoon, take the path on the right and then walk anti-clockwise around the park. The alternative subway access is the Olympic Station (P550) but there is a lot walking to do ie from there to walk around the park to Mongchontoseong station.", November 2019
3,4.0,Great to see an Olympic Park so well used many years after the games,I love the Olympics and have visited a number of Olympic cities over the years. How they use the park after the games varies a lot from country to county. Here in Seoul it was good to see the park so busy and well used although turning the former Olympic stadium into an O2 type venue has obviously helped. The Olympic gate and flame were worth seeing., September 2019

5,3.0,Olympic Park,"Easy to see on an electric scooter that can be hired in and around the park. None of the sporting venues are accessible to the public for a look in, but they are still standing. There is a Flag Plaza that is also a legacy of time as well as the Olympic Flame.", October 2019

12,4.0,Venue for the TWICE concert,"I've been in the Olympic park before for a conference but this year it was the venue for my son's favorite girl group, TWICE. It was a coincidence that they were having a concert while we were on vacation in South Korea. So we watched it. The place is so wide that we were late in the concert. We walked and walked and walked until we reached the venue. The Olympic park is huge or should I say gigantic. We had to ask a lot of people before we arrived in the right venue.This place is good for concerts, shows and festivities. It's also a great place for exercise (gosh all that walking. It's also nice place for dining or have a simple picnic. I saw also photo shoots while I was walking towards the venue of the concert.I love the place. It's spacious and good all for all ages.", May 2019
13,4.0,Good place for a run,I very much enjoyed going for a run in the area and then later taking a closer look at different aspects of the park.

18,5.0,Having a valuable time with your people,"This park is known as the symbol of the Olympics 1988 in Seoul. It is very big and in the park there are many facilities for exercising such as sporting equipment, swimming pool, and bike road. Many people always come to the Olympic Park to exercise or walk. Also there is a big lake in the middle of the park, and it also has many trees, flowers and grasses, so that people can see great views of a natural environment. The best thing is that anyone can use this park anytime for free. For example, some familes come to have a great time with each other, some couples have a great date in the park, children ride a bicycle with their friends, Also even if you don't have enough time to look around this park, there is a train surrounding the park so you can see all parts of the park with it.

Original purpose was to look for flower beds but couldn't find. Walking up to the tallest hill there can have a good view around too.", September 2018
20,3.0,Worth paying a visit,"The Olympic Park is a very diverse place to start off, lots of trees and sub-nature but also a lot of facilities. You can really experience much in the Olympic Park touring the statues, buildings and more. One thing about the park overall is that the facilities are quite outdated, so if you are a type of person who likes fresh and all clean facilities, I do not recommend this place to you. For me, it was worth paying a visit and if you just want to enjoy your day walking around and touring why not pay a visit to the Olympic Park?", March 2019
21,3.0,Looks outdated ,I love Olympics and the spirit inspires. In this case it didn’t impressed me. I expected more. But happy because I got my selfie., February 2019

25,5.0,Lots to see,The only problem with this lovely park is that in sub zero temperatures it’s impossible to walk round all of it.  There is a monument with lots of information about how the games came to Seoul as well as names of all the gold medal winners. The outdoor sculptures are excellent but the indoor display was a bit too modern for me., January 2019
26,5.0,Beautiful in autumn,"The Olympic Park is most beautiful in autumn, particularly towards sunset. There are two main entrances, Previously I came out from Metro station 813 on Line 8 (Monchontoseong) and could see the Olympic arch right in front of me. However this time I came out of the Olympic Park metro station P550, after changing at Gangdong on Line 5. A bit confused, I walked straight and then walked around the park in a counter-clockwise direction. It took a couple of hours of leisurely walk to get back to Monchongtoseong but it was worth the trouble. The scenery was really beautiful in autumn, all along the walk. At one point I was lost at a junction in the park. The sun was going down but I was still quite far away from the park entrance. The signs were all in Korean (no English); what a pity! Tried Google Map but it was not much help. Anyway, I gambled and took the uphill path on my right instead of the level walk on the left; fortunately it worked out. The path brought me to a bridge and the surrounding sunset scenery was fascinating. Further down, I recognized the large courtyard with many flags; the Monchontoseong station was right behind the Olympic arch. Actually there is a short-cut path between the two main entrances, but if you take this shortcut, you will miss most of the beautiful scenery.", November 2018
27,5.0,A Vibrant Happening Place for All,"We visited on a fine autumn day. Autumn foliage was everywhere and made the park so beautiful. It is a big place, so it does not feel crowded. We started from the Mongchontoseong Station and took a nice walk at the road beside the park to enjoy the yellow  trees there. Then we went back into the park towards the Peace Gate. While looking for cosmos flowers at the Wild Flowers Garden, I stumbled upon a field of beautiful pink muhly flowers instead and was so thrilled!", November 2018
28,4.0,Oasis in the City,"When i visited this park in early autumn on a weekend afternoon, it was a hub of activity, with young families taking a stroll and youths hanging around the entrance at the southern entrance of the park.It is a spacious park that makes for a nice stroll especially during sunset. Do set aside at least one hour to adequately cover the entire park along with stops to take photos. Best to reach here using the Seoul subway, alight at the Mongchontoseong (World Peace Station) station along the pink line.", October 2018
29,5.0,Escape to green,This is one of the nearest to be in if you want to be in a place where full of trees. It could be crowded especially during a festival or an event. A great escape for couples where needs to spend alone time., November 2018

31,5.0,the famous place,"Korea made Olympic park because of the Olympic game. 1988 in Korea there was Olympic game so they built it, but the people still using it very usefully. In the Olympic park there are concerts very often. such as singing concert or musical. also in the olympic park they made sports institution very well so many people can enjoy it freely. such as skate board or inline skate things. so around the olympic park always there are heavy traffic.so some people don't go to there because of the time spending. the most important thing is that you can see the 1980 style of the Korea.", July 2018
32,5.0,"Large, Beautiful Park","We visited this park and easily could've spent the day wandering around but instead it was just a long morning but we did not get to see everything we wanted. With the fall foliage, this park is gorgeous and clean. They had some fitness classes going on during the time we were there as well as kids learning to skate.

36,5.0,A Must for Sports Fans,"What an experience to explore the location of the 1988 Summer Olympic Games, the site is expansive with several museums and outdoors art/sculpture. The flame is still burning and the Olympic spirit lives on 30 years later.", October 2018
37,4.0,A big park that needs hour to walk,We went there on a weekday and the park was not crowded. The park is so large and it needs hours to walk. It is advised to wear good walking or jogging shoes.Pay attention to the lovely rabbits. You may find a few jumping around somewhere in the park!, September 2018
38,4.0,Nice place to take walks,"This is a nice park with a lot of art pieces all over the place. We also went to the Museum in the park and enjoyed it quite a lot. Not too crowded either. And of course the gate is very impressive. Would recommend this for picnics, dates or just taking a stroll.", August 2018
39,4.0,Remembering the Olympics and Baekje period,"My family and I spent about three hours on a sunny weekday mid-morning at this park, which commemorates the 1988 Seoul Olympics Game.Getting there: We took the subway Line 8 to Mongchontoseong (World Peace Gate) station and came out at Exit 1. This took us to the west end of the Olympic Park where the World Peace Gate is. Alternatively, you could take subway Line 5 to Olympic Park (Korea National Sport University) station and come out at Exit 3; this will be at the east end of the Olympic Park. Entry to the Olympic Park is free.The Park: As we went on a weekday, there was not many visitors, just several locals exercising and relaxing. Hence we had a nice stroll and photograph taking with regular “shade stops” from hot sun. Be mindful that Olympic Park is huge, hence you could opt to take Hodori Train that departs from in front of the Peace Square playground at certain timings (weekdays at 10:30, 11:30, and hourly from 13:00 to 18:00)What we liked:(1)	The calming and peaceful effect of the Olympic Park as most of it occupied by flora (eco-friendly forest, plants, flowers, and sprawling grass fields). (2)	It beautifully integrates history of the Hanseong Baekje period (e.g. Mongchontoseong Fortress) with the modern state-of-the-art sports stadiums and museums.(3)	The following sights: (1) World Peace Gate and the burning fire torch for Seoul Peace Declaration (2) World Peace Square with the flags (3) Sculptures, particularly The Thumb, Dialogue and this dramatic 78 feet high red arc steel sculpture (by Italian artist Mauro Staccioli) that’s shaped like an archer’s bow (4) Mongchonho Lake and the musical fountain (5) Wild Flower Garden (6) One Tree Hill (7) Exhibit of a 430-year-old Protected Tree that is still living with half of its trunk. (4)	Due to the Olympic Park’s proximity to the prominent white Lotte World Seoul Sky Tower, we were able to see the Tower from some parts of the Park.(5)	Walking past several sport facilities, e.g. SK Handball Stadium (Olympic Fencing Stadium), Olympic Swimming Complex and the Olympic Velodrome stadiumWhat we didn’t like(1)	We didn’t have enough time for a few interesting indoor sights that enabled us to escape from the outside elements: K-Pop Music Exhibition Hall (part of the Olympic Hall), SOMA Museum of Art, Mongchon Museum of History, Seoul Baekje Museum.  Did I not say the Olympic Park (2)	During our walk along the Montchontoseong walking paths, we expected to find stone or wall-built castle or fortress physical remnants of the 2.7 km historic Montchontoseong Fortress Wall (built during the Baekje period). Instead, it turned out to be a fortification structure (e.g. bank) that was covered with earth over the centuries.  While we enjoyed walking the Olympic Stadium, we realised that it is competing with so many other attractions in Seoul. If you are keen sports fan and history lover, then Olympic Park is a “must visit”. If not, I recommend you come to Olympic Park if you have the time. And if you do, don't forget that comfortable pair of walking shoes, protection from the sun and lots of drinking fluids.", June 2018
40,4.0,"at late summer, you can experience cosmos flower","although I'm not a big fan of flowers, i still went to olympic park, just to make sure, i would go to every part of seoul before i went back for good. im not sure what to do here, but the park is quite big, if you come during the summer, there will be small rose garden, cosmos flower, orange color, then another one type of flower which i dont know but the color were purple and pink. the scenery was so beautiful, i went there before 1-2 hours before dusk, and take the pic at the sun set color.", September 2017

There are numerous restaurants and food outlets in the park.", May 2018
48,4.0,Feel the mystique of the 1988 Olympics,"You probably won't be able to enter the aging Olympic stadium, still bearing the Olympic rings and mascot. But you can still peak inside and see the track where Flo Jo notched four gold medals in 1988, still holding the 200m world record to this day. You can imagine legendary Carl Lewis earning his final Olympic gold medal in an open track event, and a future superstar Michael Johnson battling a fracture that prevented him from qualifying in the 400m, the last Olympics in which few would know his name.You can even see the nearby aquatic facility where Greg Louganis infamously struck his head on the diving board. This Olympic venue is pretty packed with unforgettable moments for those of us who watched it unfold live, and although this is more browsing than in-depth touring, it's still worth seeing the expansive park and an incredibly historic venue decades removed from its glorious past.", July 2018
49,5.0,Amazing legacy,"We arrived on an incredibly hot day, hoping to see everything before the afternoon heat came!

There are trails and sculptures scattered all around.  The Seoul Olympic Museum of Art (SOMA) in the park holds an exhibition on contemporary art at the time of visit (free admission on the last Wednesday of the month, all the better).Note that the World Peace Gate Square is near Metro Station Mongchontoseong (Line 8) on the south west side,  and not by the Olympic Park Station (Line 5) which is on the east side of the park.", June 2018

Awesome place!!!", July 2017
77,5.0,A nice experience if you have the time,"The park is a bit out of the way, I remember it taking us quite a while to get here from Hongdae. However, because of this it's a quiet place for a nice stroll or bike ride away from the hustle and bustle of Seoul. You can see a lot of the locals utilizing this place and it's nice use of land built for the olympics previously as you hear in the news that more recent venues are completely unused or abandoned.

It is off the beaten path and provides a quiet green oasis in urban Seoul.  The imposing entrance at the World Peace Gate is not to be missed, especially at night when kids and parents fill the plaza with bikes and kites and energy.  The small lake is a nice spot to watch birds is the morning as well as an array of citizens exercising.  The hiking paths are plentiful and it is pleasant to hike along with Seoul seniors out for a morning walk.If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle and mingle with the local crowd, it is a great location.  It shows the positive uses that can be made of former Olympic venues.", June 2017

We entered via the front going through the expansive Peace Square plaza and along the boulevards lined by pillar masks made by sculptor Seung-Taek Lee that leads to the World Peace Gate and the eternal flame.  We hired a tandem bike so we could quickly get an overview of the park and then decide which spots we would like to cover in greater depth.

And the long walk continues. If you are tourist, you would feel lost. Are you here to see the many sports centres, like velodrome, tennis, swimming?They are all separate. In the past, the Gov provided some sort of  "" tour bus""  free of charge ; it went round the park but today I visited the website, this service is not mentioned anymore. Last year I was there on a weekday, the sports centres were closed.The Velodrome was closed. We walked around, wondering how to access.There were some Koreans going in and out of an office in the velodrome building but they would not help.  They were very unfriendly. Later, we found a little gate and we went through that , to see the interior of the velodrome for a few minutes. After that it was a long walk back to the main road. The terrain is not elderly or handicap friendly.", January 2016

From that day on I wanted to visit Seoul and the Olympic park, this year I finally got to go. With my memories firmly embedded in my mind I set off walking around this magnificent park, viewing the sculptures that each visiting team had left and the still used facilities.

109,5.0,Glorious autumn leaves walk!,"Oh this was one of our most favorite days in Seoul. The park was big, beautiful and so well maintained. We went through the main entrance first because the street beside it is famous for the beautiful rows of yellow leave trees (forgotten their names!) but the park itself is just as stunning! Very peaceful, great for a stroll and picnic. The small speakers around the park even had classical music playing out of it which was a cute touch. LOVED this place!", November 2015

114,3.0,Nice but nothing more,Its great that Seoul has gotten use of their olympic park. Its a nice area where you get to see some historical thing along with the old stadiums.

115,5.0,Lovely park,"We took the metro here which was convenient and easy to locate.   On the day we came there was an exhibition or festival with activities going on as there were lots of tents with segways, tennis and bmx around.   We watched a motorbike show with a few bikes doing stunts. The park was quite busy with school aged children around cycling,  people having a walk and taking their children to the playground.   The Olympic flame is still going and there is a museum which is free which was worth a pop in although there was potential to be much better and informative. We hired a 4 wheel bike for 1,000 won for 60 mins which was fun to go around searching for the various stadiums to save on a lot of steps and time.   The park is a great place to get away from the hustle and bustle of it all and whiled away a couple of hours for us.", September 2016

We only spent about an hour, but could go inside many of the buildings, such as the gymnastics arena, the indoor pool, etc.  wish we could have found a gift shop.  Lots of great Statues here. The acupressure path lets you walk on a walkway made of many types of stones, wooden beams, etc. that excercise parts of your feet.

Walking for a bit I started to also see the several interesting and somewhat curious sculptures along with a map of the grounds. IF you just want to see the World Peace Gate then go to the West Gate and you are good. If you however want a wonderful walk alongside with interesting sights on your way - the East Gate is a good point. Along with the statues you can enjoy a peaceful walk with the locals going about their everyday activities.

I got off at the Olympic Park Station but would actually recommend going to the Mongchontoseong Station since it's near the World Peace Gate. That and several structures around it (place with all the flags) are the best photo opportunities.  It's basically a HUGE park, which isn't bad if you just want to relax and enjoy the scenery or get some exercise.  If you so choose, there are actually fitness machines that you can use at the park.", October 2015
130,3.0,Just a park,"It's a great park for a walk in the middle of the city, but not much more, Not many signs in English here, so I had some problems getting around or knowing what it was.

If you don’t get a bike, be prepared to walk. It is a bit run down now but so are many of the 2008 Olympic sites in Beijing and that occurred 20 years later.

There were street food vendors so you don't need to worry about going hungry.  For some odd reason I did not see any taxi stand and it was hard to catch a taxi since the road was gated off at the main entrance.  My other mistake was taking a taxi here to the concert at 6pm.  It was a total disaster.  Taking the subway would've been easier and faster during rush hour., March 2016
138,5.0,Well designed park,"I was travelling with a sports enthusiast thus we had to visit the Olympic Park. The admission is free and there is a long path with modern art sculpture.

Not a really big deal beyond that.  it has a lot of history since this is where the 1988 summer games were held, but you can't get into any of the buildings so there is really nothing to do.

The park, skillfully landscaped and complete with lakes, waterfalls and modern sculptures, can be explored on double bikes or 4 biker-seats and hired by the hour for a reasonable price.

If on the other hand you are like us and enjoy gardening visiting this site gives you an appreciation of Korean gardening styles.  You will have to walk past the entrance area and head down to the lake and walk clockwise around the water and across the stone bridge.  From there follow the path till you come to a archaeological dig, where they are searching for the inhabitants from 2000 years ago and go up that path will take you up the hill, which were the original battlements of the town.  Along the way you will find arbors of gourds and fields of flowers (we visited in late summer), as well as the Korean style of forest garden, where the concept is to construct a garden to look like an untouched forest, with grasses trees and shrubs.  Sometimes the trees are pruned to make them appear much older so to create a the view of seeing a forest from a distance and so using less space.  You can visit the pit hut where excavations done twenty years ago show the remains of part of the old huts, there is a guide inside who is extremely helpful and knowledgeable, and has a passing understanding of english. We spent four hours here and would recommend it for anyone with an interest in gardening.", August 2015

178,5.0,Korean Baseball Game,saw a baseball game here at it was a blast. perhaps the highlight of my trip to seoul. Korean baseball is so much more fun than in US because the fans rarely sit down and every batter has his own dance cheer that the entire crowd does. awesome!, August 2015

It is quite a sight when you exit the Monchongtoseong subway station and emerge up the steps to get your first glimpse of the majestic World Peace Gate, with the Olympic rings proudly displayed, and the surrounding colonnade of flags of all the countries that participated in the 1988 Olympics. I enjoyed spotting the flags of the many countries which no longer exist today and reading about the events of the 1988 Games on the long memorial beside the beautiful lake, which has lovely fountains that come on at the top of the hour. The extensive park is beautifully maintained and the Mongchon Fortress Promenade along the top of the ramparts of the ancient Mongchon fortress, which stood here hundreds of years ago, offers incredible views of Seoul in all directions and is a must-do. It was lovely to spend a few hours walking around the park, getting fresh air in the middle of a huge city, taking in the delightful gardens and visiting the many museums. The Olympic Museum and Baekje Museum are well worth a visit! I am not usually a fan of parks but the Seoul Olympic Park is one of the loveliest places I have ever visited overseas.

I happened to benefit from viewing the Frida Kahlo exhibit at SOMA, which is very close to the Peace Memorial entrance.  Most museums are closed on Mondays, so having unexpected art moment really made my visit to this park special.  The sculpture garden is extensive--pictures do not do it justice.

208,5.0,Beautiful park,"I didn't have time to visit the museums there, but the park itself was beautiful and nice to walk around.

Walking is more relaxing.", April 2015

214,4.0,Another great Seoul park,"Being in the middle of winter, at first I didn't take to the park.  But like all Korean parks it has a lot to offer, and you need to spend time to find all the treasures.  I think it would be spectacular looking green and with filled lakes and streams in the other seasons.  There is art galore, wide open spaces, the majority of the Olymic venues, and even archeological digs.  I actually liked that several food chains were on site as I grabbed to go and had a picnic lunch.  You can hire bikes or go ice ice skating in winter.  I would recommend the fortress promenade, as you gain a great view around the area in a 360 degree panorama as you follow the path of the Mongchon Ramparts.  You can get to either end of the park on No 5 line (Olympic Park, venues) or No 8 Line (Mongchotoseong, world peace gate).", January 2015

Seoul was no exception and I really enjoyed Olympic Park.It wasn't a nice day when I went, but I still had the chance to enjoy walking around the park.  While I didn't do the whole park, I was impressed by the entrance to the park and looking at the totems as you walk in.  I had to make a point of checking the results of all the events that are engraved in the wall behind the flags of nations.The entire park area is quite large and some of the venues are still used today, which is something that I really appreciated about the facility.", July 2014
224,4.0,Strolling Thru History,"This is an awesome legendary place to be, especially when you have your kids. Take a leisure stroll down the park, luscious trees will provide you shade, benches to rest or have a picnic! And their stadiums are truly majestic!", May 2014
225,5.0,A wonderful day at the Olympic Park,"Seoul's Olympic Park is an underestimated place, in my opinion. It is a lovely place for a day or at least half a day out.The park has different parts. There is the 'real' Olympic part, with an Olympic Museum and outdoor sculptures and all. And there is an adjacent sculpture park with the SOMA and another museum. All in all there are 100-200 huge sculptures from all around the world in a pretty, forest park!! How cool is that?!There is a lake, you can have a bite and a coffee in Angelinus, you can rent a bike, walk, people-watch and just relax.If you like sculpture parks, then I highly recommend this place.", March 2014
226,4.0,Pretty Awesome Place!,"I've never been to an Olympic related venue/area before, but this place did not disappoint. It was awesome, and easy to get too as it was located right off of the Mongchontoseong metro station. When you come up the stairs, you'll see the World Peace Gate (Wing like structure) which is kind of cool. It's lovely to take a look at an area where the world's best athletes competed. If memory serves me right, I believe Jackie Joyner-Kersee (American) set the heptathlon world record of 7,291 points. As a tourist, I appreciated the open space of the park, and the history of the 1988 summer games. I did not get to see the actual venues, but I heard they were in use and not turning into vacant eye sores. It's a very pleasant place to take pictures, walk, or simply chill out and reflect. I would recommend making it a point to visit this area, even if for a half hour. Cheers!", April 2014
227,5.0,Great Sunday stroll,"Went to the park today and as with everywhere in Korea, it was immaculate, beautifully clean and tidy. It was lovely to watch all of the locals out cycling, kite flying, picnicking and enjoying themselves. We went to the excellent Olympic museum, - inside there are life sized photos of the winning Koreans from the Winter Olympics. Also a bobsleigh and a skeleton bob to try out for photos. There are lots of coffee stops and loads to see and do. We didn't go in any of the stadiums, but they all looked busy and well used.", April 2014
228,4.0,Leisurely stroll in a historic landmark,"The Olympic Park was one of my must-see sites during a trip to Seoul last spring. Easily accessible by subway, the first image you will see upon ascending the station is the World Peace Gate, welcoming you with open arms. Even if the games in Seoul were held many years back (in 1988), it still gives a modern, austere appeal. When you pass through it you will find an hourglass sculpture with the flags forming a semi-circle around it, symbolic of the participant nations -- worth examining! The park is kept clean, trees and shrubbery giving a fresh touch, the facilities adequate, definitely a wonderful place to while away the hours. There were many families and children (even on a weekday) that made the atmosphere pleasant. I had quite a blast just going around the mouth of the park (parade of flags, the fountain in the pond at the back) that I haven't had enough time to explore the actual Olympic complex, Jamsil Stadium and all! Maybe next time -- in autumn perhaps.See more of my Olympic Park experience with photos here: http://wp.me/p4jgtM-2UHappy traveling! -- Elliehttp://freeatleisure.wordpress.com", April 2013

In the park there's a lot of maple trees with vivid red colour. Highly recommended for a visit in autumn.There is a Bakje Museum located in the park which just open in 2012. They offer volunteer service which provides free English tour of the museum. I really enjoyed the tour which gave comprehensive information about the Bakje., November 2013
231,3.0,for outdoor activities / stadium,"well, the place is more like for local weekend outdoor activities with families and concert held at the stadium areas. family type bicycle are available for rental and it is good place for jogging and spending time with your family and sunset relaxation", October 2013
232,4.0,Olympic Park is a great place to get away from the City...,"I just got back from my vacation to seoul and even though i live in Korea, i like to visit nature and i love the feeling of walking through this park and there are rabbits running around all over the place. I fed one a chestnut and acorn and there are furry black squirrels running around. Fall is the best season to go, in my opinion, the flowers are still out and the leaves are starting to change and its a great place for a picnic. PLan on spending some time walking around cause there is alot of choices to explore. This time we found a building ontop of one of the hills and inside there was the original so called blueprints for how they used to build areas by digging holes and burrying things for storage and refrigeration, was really cool. There is a little passenger train that will take you around the park if you want but i suggest that you just suck it up and walk and explore and take some photos. In the winter in the entrance quad they make an ice skating rink, there is always something happening there on the weekends. Best idea is the check it out and bring some bottled water cause the vending machines in the park are expensive for a tiny bottle of water. I always stop by a convienience store and buy water there at half the price. Enjoy cause it a great way to escape the hustle of the busy city.", October 2013
233,4.0,A lovely place for a walk at sunset,"I found the Olympic Park to be really picturesque and interesting, with some great photo opportunities at sunset.Bearing in mind that Seoul hosted the Olympics 25 years ago (1988), it's great to see that the ""legacy"" of the park is still live and kicking (especially for those of us in countries with more recent Olympics!).I took the metro over to Olympic Park Metro station, then wandered along the main artery over the arcing road bridge toward the arc statue, between the main stadia, around the edge of the lake (past a park full of interesting statues) and to the main plaza with all of the world's flags and a still-burning flame amidst the iconic Olympic landmark building. There are lovely views over the lake.Then you can just pop into Mong Chon Fortress metro station and off you go!Very pleasant walk.", June 2013
234,4.0,Ajumma & Ajusshi Adventure Fitness Area!,"You've got to love Korea, they really know how to take something as low key and relaxing as a park, then turn it into an ajumma & ajusshi adventure fitness area!When you're living in the urban concrete jungle that is Seoul, these small slices of greenery are a haven and sanctuary that help you reconnect with nature. Olympic Park provides you with an user-friendly area to get your daily walk in, complete with small hills, a ""fortress"", outdoor exercise equipment and of course classical music floating in the air from the conveniently placed speakers throughout the area. During winter they even turn part of it into an open-air ice rink! If it's too cold outside, there is the convenience of a Tous Les Jours bakery, a S-bucks and other strategically placed restaurants and cafes to keep you warm!Go there with an open mind, with the view to relax or take a peaceful walk and you'll enjoy what Olympic Park has to offer.", August 2012
235,2.0,Disappointing,"Olympic park was somewhat disappointing. It's out of city center, easily accesible by subway however, and I found it to be nothing except a big park. They supposedly have over  200 statues around the park, but I didn't see any. Not worth the long subway ride.", May 2012
236,5.0,Seoul Jazz Festival 2012,"Amazing venue for a fantastic concert; great walks around the park with some beautiful gardens, ponds, sculptures and so on.", May 2012
237,4.0,nice,"interesting park, decent views, well landscaped and well looked after.  nice place for a stroll, or to sit with a few beers!", October 2011
238,5.0,Snow Spectacle,"We live in a country with a tropical climate and its our first time to see a snow..we were so amazed..its a beautiful sight but very, very cool.   although we had a great time mingling with the guys skating in the rink...twas such a beautiful sight...we hope we could be back in another season...autumn or summer perhaps...", February 2012
239,4.0,A nice place for a stroll...,"The stadia themselves now look a bit dated, but the park is great. As you walk up the main road away from the park, there a statues by different artists of different sports.", April 2011
240,5.0,"very wide park, so clean","Seoul Olympic Park is a very wide, spacious and clean park. The toilets are clean and well-maintained. I was tired walking around but I enjoyed how creative it was built. It's good for families to stroll too.", September 2011
241,4.0,Nice get away for a few hours,"The park is located just outside the main areas of Seoul and makes for a pleasant distraction from the hustle and bustle of Seoul city.  Its a great place to spend a few hours on a really nice sunny day during Spring and Autumn though I'd imagine going there in Winter isn't something to recommend. A small disappointment is that not all the Olympic venues are 1) in the park or 2) open to the public.  However, there is an Olympics museum on the grounds but that itself is a bit dated and can be improved.  Bicycles can be rented as are the ones of the 4 wheeled variety which is pretty interesting to try as well.The grounds of the park are very nicely maintained and just spending a few hours walking around away from the city is very pleasant and something recommended to do.", October 2011
