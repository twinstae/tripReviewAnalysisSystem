0,5.0,Great Experience,This was a must see place on our Seoul sightseeing list.. Be sure to stick around for the changing of the guard. You can also take pictures of the guards and have you picture taken with them as long as you don’t touch them. Quite an experience with some fantastic photo, February 2020
1,5.0,Nice Palace,This palace in Seoul located across from City Hall plaza is very nice.  They have a palace guard program where you can sign up and be a part of a ceremony., July 2019
2,5.0,One of my favorite Palace!,This is an amazing place and we had so much fun! We have tried their tradition costume (Hanbok) and tour around the palace. A huge place to roam around and very interesting history!, November 2019
3,3.0,The gatehouse is an easy visit,"As with most Korean historical sites, this one is mostly reconstructed, but the gatehouse somehow survived fire, war and Japanese demolition orders. Easy to pop into.", November 2019
4,5.0,Peaceful Grounds,"I love its peaceful grounds, one can appreciate the beauty of this palace. The greenhouse is interesting. Less touristy than Gyeongbokgung Palace. I'm sure this palace is perfect especially in Spring time.", December 2019
5,4.0,4/5,Visited this with the Changdeokgung palace and overall was a great experience getting to understand the various structures and details in the palace grounds, November 2019
6,4.0,Another palace if you have the time ,"This palace stands next to the Changdeokgung palace and is smaller and less impressive. There is a wall separating the two palaces, with a gate. The palace gardens are vast.", April 2019
7,5.0,So interesting wandering through this Palace.,"Paid entry but guides outside offer to show you through this palace for free ,part of their further education ,these guys gave us a true history that you would not realise if you simply wandered through on your own. English names were  Bill and his Father  ,Terminator!.", November 2019
8,5.0,Beautiful palace,Very peaceful and calm atmosphere well worth the visit to this cultural historic site in the center of Seoul. The grounds are really spectacular I took a picnic and sat and people watched ., August 2019
9,5.0,Another beautiful palace,"Just as beautiful as the other palaces, but with different attractions. Greenhouse especially beautiful. The free tour was very good. A small (unmarked) side gate leads to the Secret Garden tour. It is very easy to miss.", September 2019
10,5.0,Nice gardens,"Not as popular as it's neighbour, Gyeonbokgung Palace, and on a smaller scale it is still very impressive although currently part of it is under re-construction. The lovely wooded gardens alone make a visit worthwhile especially on a sunny day in Autumn when the trees are changing colour.", October 2019
11,3.0,Not the most eye-catching of all the palaces bit worth a quick visit,Changgyeonggung is not the most beautiful of the palaces - and to be honest we only went because the gate to it was right there when we finished the Secret Garden tour - but worth a quick look round if you happen to have the palace pass., September 2019
12,4.0,Nice walks,In this complex there are some nice walks in the gardens and wooded areas.  When we went the Autumn colours were showing so it was quite pretty.  Many people dressed in traditional costume to get in free and it made the Palace like a living museum., October 2019
13,4.0,Very very very very very busy,I am giving this four stars as I believe it would have been a wonderful place to visit but there were so many people there I couldn't get near it.  I watched the changing of the guard which was slow and a little dull and I spent my time trying to figure out if they were wearing false beards but I think that says more about me than the spectacle.  Worth it if you're off-season or more patient than I, September 2019
14,3.0,"Good to visit if you have the time or particularly like gardens, not a must-see","Relative to Gyeongbokgung or Changdeokgung, this palace is much smaller in size and there is much less to see. The star is in the garden, not in the buildings, most of which were destroyed and have not yet been reconstructed. The palace itself was always meant as a more minor palace to the other two, as lodgings for the dowager queens and concubines.If you really like garden walks, this may be worth it; there's a pretty pond garden that's part of the compound. Otherwise, it's definitely not a must-see, particularly if you've covered either or both of the other two. No audioguide available, and limited placard information available on what buildings do exist at this palace. Some construction underway at present, as well.That said, if you're up for it, you should visit this palace as part of your visit to Changdeokgung; it's just more convenient that way. Towards the tail end of your walk through Changdeokgung you'll see a ticket stand and entry point that gives you entrance to this palace without needing to circle all the way around on the outside; the two palaces abut each other. If you do need to go back into Changdeokgung later (i.e., audioguide return), you'll be able to reenter with your original Changdeokgung ticket, so make sure you hold onto it. Much easier to do the visit this way rather than the extra walking back and forth between the two palaces.", October 2019
15,4.0,Another Impressive Castle Built by King Sejong,"Built in the mid 15th century it was essentially destroyed by the Japanese in the 16th century, rebuilt and again and in the early 1900's the Japanese did it again. It is impressive and worthy of a visit.", September 2019
16,5.0,Nice palace,A worthwhile visit after the Gyengong palace.. If you are lucky you will find a cultural event while walking around, September 2019
17,4.0,Palace and garden,"With around 5 palaces in Seoul, difficult to choose which to visit. This one is open tuesday to sun, you do not have to book a tour, though for the secret garden you do.  Nicely painted buildings. Good to visit .", September 2019
18,4.0,Great for pictures and to learn about the history,This place is awesome and really nice to be. Not the typical temple cause it has an europen part as well., October 2018
19,5.0,The palace of tragedy of Joseon dynasty.,"Changgyeonggung is one of the five palaces of Joseon dynasty.The palace was built in 1418, by the Great King Sejong of Joseon dynasty and renovated and enlarged in 1483 by King Seongjong. It was destroyed during Japan's invasion of 16th century. It was rebuilt by successive Joseon Kings but in the Japanese colonial period in the early 20th century, it was once again heavily destroyed by the Japanese. They destroyed many buildings to build a Zoo! Now a days many parts of the palace have been rebuilt and restored, but it's still far and far away.Specially, in this palace, many historical tragedies of Joseon dynasty have taken place.I introduce here two events.In 1701, queen Jang Hui-bin who lived here was sentenced to death by poison by King Sukjong, the husband.In 1762, Prince Sado  was executed by order of his father, Yeongjo, and died of starvation by being confined in a rice chest. Yeongjo gave him the posthumous title Sado, meaning ""Thinking of with great sorrow.""I have visited here two weeks ago, with my family.It was a really impressive place.I recommend to visit here at night. The palace is opened at night during summer.", August 2019
20,4.0,Be prepared to walk,"The grounds were spread apart and had several steps and stairs, this is a workout. The buildings were open air and empty so you need to visualize how they were used in th roast. My favorite part was to notice the beautifully and colorfully painted ceilings,. Be sure to look up!", August 2019
21,5.0,Royal Palace,Changgyeonggung Palace is one of the 5 palaces of Seoul. Not as large or impressive as its neighbour Changdeokgung Palace but a good site to see all the same. Good examples of Josean style architecture. The gardens are particularly good and there is a greenhouse modelled on Crystal Palace. Good value at 1000KW. Entrance can be had from neighbouring Changdeokgung Palace., July 2019
22,4.0,One of the 4 palaces to see,"Changyeonggung is located just next to Changdeokgung. You can enter through either palaces and go to the other one with a purchased ticket. This palace is also under restoration. It is smaller than Changdeokgung and Gyeongbukgung and can easily be completed in less than 1 hour. Changyeonggung is included in the Royal Palace Pass. A good deal if you have enough time to visit all 4 main palaces, the Secret Garden and Jongmyo Shrine.", July 2019
23,5.0,Familiarity with Korean culture and history.,"Traditional korean architecture. The palace was partially restored after the war, but some parts, for example, roof tiles, are genuine. Very atmospheric photos are obtained.", July 2019
24,5.0,A must see,It is a major part of Korean history and an obvious great source of pride for the country.  I do suggest you see the queens quarters/area to get away from the crowds and manage a closer look at things., July 2019
25,4.0,Not to miss the tranquil greenhouse and pond,"The palace was originally built by the 4th ruler of the Joseon Dynasty, King Sejong for his retiring father, King Taejong. It served as residential quarters for queens and concubines. The main building is Myeongjeongmun, the office of the king and it is the oldest of the Joseon Dynasty palaces. There are many palace buildings - royal family rooms, halls & pavilions spread over the compound. What I enjoyed most is the leisure walk towards the greenhouse and its nearby ponds. Tranquil indeed.Besides the main entrance at the eastern side, there is another entrance next to the Changdeokgung Palace Huwon garden. Hence it is best to combine your visit with Changdeokgung Palace and Huwon garden.", June 2019
26,4.0,Interesting and peacefull retreat,A real interesting complex consisting of several 'palaces' build in the 15th century. Good for a stroll of 1.5 hrs and to escape the buzz of the city. Very nicely maintained and the surrounding wall gives a feeling of being out of Seoul, July 2019
27,5.0,Seoul Searching,"Nice place to go for a walk while admiring the beautiful ancient structures in the grounds.  Depending on the time of your visit, there are pocket gardens that can be in full bloom.", March 2019
28,4.0,An easy stroll with serene sights,"I was not let down by this site. I generally came here for the serene gardens, walking paths, and old architecture. Along the way I learned about Korean royalty. A must see is the greenhouse here with VERY amazing bonsai.", June 2019
29,5.0,My favorite palace in Seoul,"Changgyeonggung is smaller compare to changdeokgung or Gyeongbokgung, but it has its own beauty. It is especially beautiful when it rains. If you are looking for peaceful place with less people, Changgyeonggung is the right place. Garden is so beautiful!!", April 2019
30,4.0,Small Palace in Park Like Setting,"This was the smallest of the palaces we visited during our trip and it had the lowest admission fee.We entered the grounds of the palace from Chandeokgung Palace and the path was elevated above the grounds.  As we walked down the stairs we saw the first buidlings one of which was used primarily by the King's concubines.   There was a lot less buildings compared to the other Palaces we toured.  However, the grounds were beautifully landscaped.Once inside the main palace complex we saw that a part of it was under renovation.  The main throne room was quite nice with highly detailed ceiling that showed a lot of craftsmanship.  However, after we finished walking through the other parts of the palace there was not much else to see.  We exited back through the entrance and had to show our other palace tickets to re-enter. Overall it was nice but if you only have a limited amount of time then I would skip this one.", June 2019
31,5.0,just stunning,We watched the changing of the guard ceremony which was fabulous! The uniforms and clours were amazing, April 2019
32,4.0,Must visit to see ancient Korean palace.,"If you want to go in for free, visit one of the neighboring shops to rent traditional Korean outfits. The place is huge and sprawling, the palace was maintained very well. If you plan to visit this place, make sure it is on a bright sunny day as the grounds are not paved so you will end up walking in mud if the weather is bad. So many tourists visiting the place, I suggest coming in early to avoid the crowds. Also, make sure to go towards the east entrance to watch the changing of the guards.", May 2019
33,4.0,Big palace complex,Cheap entry ticket. Nice cherry blossoms and beautiful garden still in April. Especially the view from the hill was particularly nice!, April 2019
34,4.0,This is a must see place,In Seoul if you are short of time do visit this Palace.  Authentic and original.  Well worth the the time., April 2019
35,5.0,Interesting place,Interesting place with a super change of guard ceremony tht happens at 10am and 2pm. must see and visit. rent hanbok outside and even get free entry into the palace, April 2019
36,4.0,"Beautiful Historical Structure, Educational Experience","I arrived into Seoul for my business first trip with zero cultural knowledge (my fault).It's a gorgeous series of structures, and the grounds/gardens are a delight.  Most of the signage includes English, which made it an good educational experience as well.", April 2019
37,5.0,Enjoyed,"The four palaces in Seoul each have unique  and intriguing histories. This palace is one of the smaller out of the four but is directly beside Changdeokgung, so one could easily spend a day visiting both. There are stairs and fair amount of walking.", April 2019
38,4.0,Very nice,I enjoyed this palace the gardens are beautiful and the grounds are not to big that you can’t do this in a few hours!!, April 2019
39,3.0,Best tried in with Changdeokgung Place,"As all the other places, just the outside of the buildings to see and all of the same decor. Be better to visit this Place when the Wildflower garden is in Bloom. Nice walk around the wooded ares. Adjacent to Changdeokgung Place with an interconnecting gate Ideal to visit both at the same time, There is a charge for both Places except for the over 65's on proof of age.", March 2019
40,5.0,Very nice gardens and buildings,We walked through this to get to another palace.  Beautiful cherry blossom was blooming everywhere (end of March), March 2019

42,5.0,has a fish pond with mandarin ducks,very huge sprawling palacehas lots of walking spacesbig gardenshas a greenhouse too with rare flowers, March 2019
43,5.0,Beautiful and quiet,"I visited the 4 main palaces and this one is definitely my favorite. Not the biggest or most colorful, but the architecture of the main building with all the overlaying roofs is fantastic. It is also a lot more quiet and peaceful than some of the other palaces (which are nice too)", March 2019
44,4.0,peaceful,"another nice traditional palace in Seoul. a nice history attached to the palace, typical korean style architecture, a very peaceful ambiance.", March 2019

47,5.0,Beautiful and quiet place!!,"Beautiful!!!! A quiet place, with a lot of history, where you can breathe a lot of peace, it has many typical constructions inside, a lake, a glass greenhouse very nice, it is worth visiting it!!!

49,4.0,Family tour in Korea,This is a truly amazing place. It looks like the secret of Korea is held in this place. A must try to place to visit!!!, November 2018
50,5.0,Last day of a working trip,"Walked down from City Hall to visit, could have spent a lot more time wandering.  Very enjoyable self tour well worth the modest fee.", October 2018
51,4.0,The lesser known palace,Seoul has quite a few palaces. Together with Changdeokgung this is the quieter one. From the backgate of Changdeokgung you walk seamlessy into Changgyeonggung. Because this palace was turned into a zoo during the Japanese occupation it has more open spaces., January 2019
52,4.0,Lovely and beautiful place to see,Certainly well worth the time to visit. Well developed site with good services. They even offer free tours. Particularly charming are the people who wander around in traditional clothes, January 2019
53,5.0,One of the most underrated palaces,"This one is definitely in my top 3 place you must visit if you’re ever in Seoul. I love this place so much! Even during winter, when everything looks gray, it still looks beautiful! It has this serene feeling. I think I’ve found the place for me to spend time in whenever I’m stressing out.", January 2019
54,5.0,Step Back in Time,"Visiting the palace grounds was like going back in time. I have watched several chinese movies about the Forbidden City in China and because of the design, you can see the Chinese influence on the artitecture.", December 2018
55,5.0,So much history,"First, the price to get in....cheap and well worth it.The buildings are absolutely beautiful. Free English tour guides are available.Don't forget your camera!!", November 2018
56,5.0,Worth a visit to palaces,The Palace tour was part of the Discover Seoul tours. Thumbs up.The arqutecture and colors you expect from Korean culture, October 2018
57,4.0,Great to explore,"The palace here is one of the major sites of Seoul, and doable with the Seoul palace card - but it’s only worth that if you plan on visiting every single site included. We didn’t have enough time for that, so merely opted for this palace as the one closest to our hostel as well as the one with the most affordable entry prices. In the main courtyard shortly after we arrived, they began some kind of show reenacting court situations in the palace, but it was all in Korean with no translation. These shows continued throughout the outsides of most of the buildings; as with most palaces of this kind in East Asia, you can only explore the grounds, not the inside itself. The grounds are nice though; as well as the palace buildings themselves there is also a fairly extensive park, and everything is signposted in Korean, Mandarin, and English - with guidebooks available in other languages as well. There’s enough to explore to last a good few hours, and another palace links to it on the side; other than that there’s only one exit back outside though - which was annoying as we were hoping to cut through the block, but you need to buy another ticket to the adjacent palace for that.", October 2018
58,4.0,Beautiful autumn colors,"In autumn (late Oct./ early Nov.), the trees in the palace turn into yellow and red. The maple trees are particularly attractive and visitors are seen to be busy taking pictures. This year (2018), the maple leaves have turned red earlier than normal. Nevertheless I could still find some interesting ones for my photography. As described under Changdeokgung, it is accessible through a small entrance right at the front of the Secret Garden.", November 2018
59,3.0,small palace,this is a smaller palace whose entrance is adjacent to huwon secret garden.  WE went in for a quick 30 minute look around while waiting for our secret garden guided tour to start., November 2018
60,5.0,English tour highly recommended,"In the middle of the old city center,wylking distance from many hotels.Nicely restored buildings.English language tour at 15.30 at no extra charge most interesting.", November 2018
61,4.0,Great palace..... a bit empty,A great place to visit. Buildings are impressive but mostly closed so you wander round the site looking at them from the outside sadly., November 2018
62,5.0,Very interesting place to visit,"Very cool place.  Its amazing how minimalistic Korean emperors lived, compared to the Chinese.  Great place to wonder around for a few hours.  Also some very cool demonstrations of changing of the guard!", October 2018
63,5.0,The most underrated Palace in Seoul,The palace is serene and not too many people came here when I was there. I visited it after Changdeokgung Palace and I think it's beautiful. You've to come here from the inside of Changdeokgung Palace because the path have beautiful scenery. And don't forget to visit the lake inside and also the green house, October 2018
64,4.0,A good Palace to visit,A great Palace to visit and very less people around. You can explore at your own leisure.A palace worth your visit., November 2017
65,4.0,The Changgyeoneggung Palace,"Consider purchasing the royal palace pass that includes 4 palaces and the royal shrine for 10,000 (approx $8.80USD) and be sure to pick up the English brochure at the entrance.Originally the palace that was on this location did not have a garden.  Now there are gardens and a pond on the grounds as well as a grand greenhouse.  Less people seem to visit this palace, it is less crowded.", October 2018
66,5.0,A palace with less tourists than Gyeongbok Palace,"*Fun fact: In line with steps to taint dignity of Korean people, during Japan's occupation in early 1900s, Japan turned this palace as a zoo. This place was later restored after liberation. A great place to learn about Korean history, along with great photo opportunities.", October 2018
67,5.0,Impressive.,"I went here in October and there was a holiday on at the time and lots of people, especially the girls were dressed in traditional costumes. Well worth visiting. Seoul is such a beautiful city", October 2018
68,5.0,just love it,You should visit all the palace. all are special in there own way. Gyeongbokgung and Changgyeonggung you  shoud visit for sure, April 2018
69,4.0,My favorite palace,"While this is the 4th most popular palace to visit in Seoul and not the most attractive, it is my favorite due to the attractive landscaped grounds and the peacefulness. Not many people visit here which is very nice. I have been here 4 times, twice during my August visit. It only costs 1,000 Won to enter. It also has a nice pond and greenhouse.", August 2018
70,4.0,Awesome day at the palace with HANNOK!! ,"Rented from HANBOKNAM (Korean Traditional Dress) The shop is messy due to the volume (tourists), but they do have a system and u must be comfortable gg through the process of picking, changing, hairdo, keeping bag in lockers and finally able set off. From the shop it is also easy to head over to the palace, bukchon village and Samcheongdong culture street (all within walking distance and do not need to take train).Purchasing from Klook with rebates is cheaper! *The palace is not as awesome as Beijing’s forbidden city.", September 2018
71,5.0,It so big,I still can't believe that I managed to get there. It is so great to experience and worth my time and money. I will absolutely go there for the photoshoot next time. I am so in love with their culture. The entire palace was so big and above my expectation. Great experience and it is the best way to learn about their history., September 2018
72,5.0,A Nice Look into the Past,"Beautiful grounds and a really nice escape from the city. Hard to believe it's only 1,000 KRW to get in.  Not as touristy as the other palaces that I went too but very tranquil. Spent several hours walking around and just enjoying watching all the people dressed up.", September 2018
73,5.0,Must be my favorite.,I came here because I was in love with one picture I saw and it delivered what I was expecting. It was sunset when I came so there were only a few people. Only 4 of us I guess. It was serene and beautiful. I'm taking about the one on the other entrance by the way... near the Hongwa gate the one with the pond. I'm just glad that I went there when it was closing because I was able to take in everything and somehow reflect on my Korean journey. ;), March 2018
74,3.0,If u have time to spare,Personally I will not visit if I was there on my own as it is not a preserved of the original palace but a re-built., September 2018
75,4.0,guided tour is a must!,the best way to really enjoy this place is the guided tour!!! you learn so much about the korean history and culture, September 2018
76,5.0,Another wonderful palace,"This palace is one of the top ones to do in Seoul (let's face it, there are a few to do if you have a lot of time) and is within walking distance of Gyeongbokung Palace so you may want to plan for both on the same day.", August 2018
77,5.0,Great History,Great to see this fabulous piece of history. The guards at the lest and right sides are cool to see. Do the fortune thing, August 2018

79,4.0,large expance,This place has some very interesting style and the large expanse makes for a great stroll.  I loved the detail work., July 2018
80,5.0,Great ancient palace to visit,Definitely worth the trip here as it is grand in size and offers a great park to walk around and some ancient royal buildings to look at.  There is actually another palace attached to this one but it takes another ticket to get in...., July 2018
81,4.0,Haunted by Prince Sado,"Wanted to visit the palace as it was where Prince Sado was murdered by his father who made him climb into a rice casket where he was locked and starved to death over 8 days. His son who became King Jeongjo, one of the most revered in Joseon dynasty, moved his father's remains to hills near Suwon and built the Hwaseong fortress. We went on an English guided tour with a friend and the guide was really good. There were hardly any other people in the tour so it was almost like a private tour. The guide explained how the palace was different as it was built for Queens rather than Kings so the inner spaces occupied a larger part of the complex. She also pointed out the courtyard where Prince Sado died in the rice casket and explained that King Jeongjo is the 2nd most beloved monarch after King Sejong who created the Hangul. The palace is right next to Changdeokgung as they used to be one palace, so worth visiting at the same time as the other palace. Defo worth a visit!!", July 2018
82,5.0,Korean History,"When we got there it was very easy to get in and maps were readily available so that tourists could have an idea of the layout of the palace. It was clean, well kept and full of different attractions such as the Korean Folk Museum and an extract of the library to browse through old Korean books. I highly recommend touring the National Folk Museum, it is extremely well laid out with pop up exhibitions and very interesting in general.The weather was pleasant and we got some superb photos of the palace on the lake and even the minor details on the palace. You will see lots of people dressed up in hanboks (traditional dress) and will be taking photos, you can also rent one at the store near the monument. Usually, if you dress up, you can get in for free. We happened to go on a day where the entrance was free regardless.", June 2018
83,5.0,Palaces,When we got there we bought the palaces ticket. So excited to see our first palace. Good for those who appreciate architecture and history., December 2017
84,5.0,Must see in Seoul,A beautiful peaceful place in the center of the city. I recommend buying the integrated palace ticket as it offers great saving, June 2018
85,5.0,A lovely palace,"In the middle of busy city, this palace was so lovely inside and out. A very quite place to visit if you want some time for yourself.", June 2018
86,5.0,Not just a palace ,"I visited all the palaces in Seoul, but I liked this one the best. The palace and halls are smaller, but I liked the wooden details. Moreover, the compound, garden, pond, trees and the Grand Greenhouse, a conservatory built in 1909, are beautiful and calming. You will also see a large variety of  flowers and plants in the greenhouse. Worth a visit!", May 2018
87,4.0,Nice afternoon stop,This palace is adjacent to the Changdeokgung Palace. It is smaller and seems to have more green space than the other palace (if you don't count the Secret Garden). It has not been as recently painted.  There is a nice hall where you can rest out of the sun on the floor., June 2018
88,3.0,Much smaller than the palaces nearby,"I gave this palace three stars, not because it isn't worth a visit but rather because it's less interesting than its two neighbors. If you have the time I would recommend visiting all the palaces in Seoul (including Gyeonghuigung and Deoksugung). If you're limited in time I'd stick to the two major ones.", May 2018
89,5.0,Amazing architecture,"If you are a history or architecture buff, then this palace is one to visit. There are many similar around Korea, but the ones in Seoul are absolutely worth the visit. A maze os smaller replica buildings give you tons to look at and the gardens are also beautiful.", May 2018
90,5.0,Incredible sight,"You can spend hours walking around the 4 sites, all in center of large city.Forbidden city impressive but this place better, as you can explore all areas.A must see.", May 2018
91,5.0,Beautiful place!,This palace is amazing. You need to get around inside them to understand how they used to live. I recommend to wear light shoes so you walk around., July 2017
92,4.0,Lovely palace,"The palace is right next to Changdeokgung hence it is very convenient. It has some cherry blossom trees as well, although not as beautiful as those in Changdeokgung. At the rear there is a large pond and a greenhouse which seems to be under construction forever (not sure if it will ever open).", April 2018
93,4.0,Old Architecture,"Entered from the back through the entrance to Changdeokgung. We didn't have to pay an entry fee since we had the Discover Seoul pass.The palace area is smaller than both Changdeokgung and Gyeongbokgung. The buildings were similar to the ones in Gyeongbokgung as it wasn't as colourful as the ones in Changdeokgung. Although not as grand as the other two, I thought that the buildings here were laid out better, particularly the area near the palace itself since they were close by and felt like the whole area was connected.It did feel a little sameish because this was the third palace we had visited in the day.", December 2017
94,5.0,Relaxing and away from shopping complex ,"Relaxing and enjoying the wood, flower, and sunny day, thanks God as it was rainy day before.  just one to two hours walking around the palace,  although not many features to see as in a museum, great to see how the wood work and builder work during that period of 19TH century.

The 'Daeonsil' Victorian Greenhouse was amazing with beautiful atmosphere. it is a must see when you visit Korea!!! and dont forget the pond it was magical.", April 2017
108,5.0,True harmony with surroundings. Greenhouse is must-visit.,"One of three biggest palaces in Seoul.- Popularity might be lower than other two(Gyengbokgung and Changdeokgung). But, this palace is well-organized with nature including amazing old trees. The pond is nice. And has the wonderful greenhouse of quaint plants.- The area is quite a lot.

109,4.0,Royal palace more suitable for couples,"Changgyeonggung palace was the last palace my sister ticked off our list.First off we should have bought the combination ticket which only costs 10000 krw to visit all the palaces, including Jongmyo shrine (would have saved us 4000krw). In hindsight, we didn't do as much research as we would or we would've discovered this earlier on.We were tired and expected little of Changgyeonggung palace (after 4 palaces,  we expected this one to be pretty much the same) Colour theme of the palaces were pretty similar, however we notes that this palace is notably a lot more romantic. We would've loved to bring our partners here! Long windy trails that goes in different directions; newlyweds taking photos in their wedding hanbok; a bench situated quite nicely facing the frozen lake with a view. These are just namely few locations we love and we don't carry a romantic bone in our bodies at all! As an added touch, the greenhouse was open (as we expected this to may still be closed for repairs or renovation) We feel rejuvenated and re inspired after our visit. It was all worth It! Fortunately for us, we were quite fast walkers and despite us loitering here and there quite a bit for picture ops and also admiring the beauty of the scenery, we spent almost 1.5 hours there. For others that may not be too much into architecture, trail walks or romance then it may take you 1 hour or less.", February 2018

114,5.0,A Must See,"If you are interested in either history or architecture, this palace is a must see. It is also the most visited palace in Seoul, so plan for that as well. We went early morning which I felt was ideal. This is the both the oldest and most famous of Seoul's palaces, though it was destroyed and then rebuilt. ""Palace greatly blessed by heaven"" is the meaning of the palace's name. It does not take long to view the sight, but I felt it was well worth our time.", June 2017

119,5.0,Interesting site,"Like all the palaces in Seoul, there's nothing actually authentic about this site. It's a modern rebuild of the palace that once stood here, that was either destroyed by fire, typhoon or the Japanese. The stories vary. There's actually not much to see other than many, many buildings. You can't visit any of them inside, only peer through the doors of the ones that are open (and there aren't many) and there's the occasional chair or throne. The grounds are very tranquil and pretty and the architecture is very interesting. You can take guided tours, offered in different languages at different times. Buy the Royal Palace Pass for W10,000 as it's a huge discount for the six sites it covers.", October 2017
120,3.0,"Not Just ""Another"" Royal Palace","Went here in November 2016 with my family and it was serene and not too vast. There's a beautiful Lotus Pond at the back of the palace and the wooded areas aren't too tiring to walk at. There are historical items/monuments along the way too with descriptions so you'd understand what it is. I remember ""finding"" this stone turtle-looking monument somewhere in the middle of the woods and according to the description, during the Joseon dynasty, placenta and umbilical cords of the royal babies were kept there. I was such a geek so I love stuff like that so yeah, this palace is worth the visit (especially when Gyeonbukgung and Chandeokgung get too touristy).But the greenhouse was under repair when we went there. The experience would be much nicer if we were able to see that too.", November 2016

122,3.0,Another royal palace,"We walked here from where we stayed. As it was late, we only managed a quick look.Nearby is the Changdeokgung Palace.  After viewing the more popular Gyeongbokgung Palace, this palace is rather small and worth a visit only if you have time.", October 2016
123,3.0,Better when the greenhouse opens,"This palace can be entered from the Changdeokgung palace. But possibly once you leave one palace, you can't re-enter. I suspected not and so did not try.It was designed mainly for elderly members of the royal family, being built in about the 15th century.Because of its purpose, the buildings are smaller than those in the other palaces. The grounds are very wooded and scenic.Sadly when I went the greenhouse, built in 1909, it was closed for refurbishment. However, there are viewing windows to allow people to admire the architecture.Viewing time is about an hour but it is very peaceful walking along the shady paths so you could easily spend longer.", September 2017
124,5.0,Quiet Palace Experience,"Beautiful, quiet space. One of the less busy palaces, you can see a lot of remarkable architectural feats and designs without the foot traffic familiar to other, larger palaces. Cheap entry - well worth checking out the secret garden too!", August 2017

129,4.0,"Rich History, a Must See","As the 3rd palace to be built in Joseon Dynasty after Gyeongbokgung Palace and Changdeokgung Palace, it was originally meant to be the residence of 3 queens due to lack of kiving space at the nearby Changdeokgung. You will notice there are only a few small halls in this palace with non specific layouts. Buildings were positioned to the topography and not strictly aligned in a particular direction. Residential inner halls are bigger and more elaborate than the administration outer halls as the compound was originally intended for residential halls. A combine tour of both palaces is possible but separate ticket must be purchase. Do not miss the Secret Garden. You will need to pay a separate ticket for the Secret Garden of 5,000 Korean Won. Trust me it's so worth it. Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese guided tours are available. Changgyeonggun Palace is close every Monday. If you are taking the Subway, the nearest station in Anguk Station Line 3 and Exit 3.", July 2017

It's smaller than other old palaces like Gyeongbokgung or Changdeokgung, but I could feel more peaceful mood here. I recommend to visit here on sunny days (when there's no smog!). Walk around and look around those sophisticated Hanoks, take a rest at Tongmyeongjeon (you can actually sit inside if you visit there at day), and go to  as far as two beautiful ponds. Also, you can buy night viewing tickets at the entrance if you have foreign passport. During night viewing, however, they close Tongmyeongjeon so you can't sit inside. ;(", May 2017

145,3.0,Worth the visit,A visit to the palace whilst in Seoul is a must.The park is very nice and well kept. The street of remembrance is a reconstruction of a Seoul strrt of the '70s. It is nice but somewhat cold. I would have make more lively with actual coffee served and the like.The entrance to the palace grounds comes at a price (2000). Worth paying it. Everything (or most of it) is a reconstruction therefore there is the need to read carefully the explanations to understand. Overall nice but not overwhelming, April 2017

148,5.0,Palace Visiting,"We recently enjoyed a tour of this magnificent Palace built in 1484.Many of the buildings were destroyed by fire a number of times & were restored in 1834.This is a huge Palace right in the heart of the City & only a few meters from the Subway @ City Hall Station.We were really lucky as the recent Tuesday we were visiting the Palace - there was a huge ceremony being performed by dozens of very visually dressed soldiers in a multiplicity of vibrant colours.The Parade was watched by 100,s of young school children & some visitors including my partner & I.After the parade we were allowed to have lots of photos with the various soldiers in their colourful costumes.Afterwards we completed a tour of the Palace  grounds & the beautiful Cherry Blossoms & other flowers that adorn the Palace Grounds.Additionally, many people hire costumes & have their photos taken by their friends & visitors alike.Very very colourful.The Palace has many superb buildings & were a pleasure to visit & enjoy.Highly recommended when anyone is visiting Seoul in South Korea", April 2017

152,4.0,Memorable Walk Down A Part of Korean History,"We went to Changgyeonggung Palace in early April as we were told that this is the Palace with the most cherry blossoms during Spring time. We were somewhat disappointed that we did not get to see as many cherry blossoms as we had hoped for (even though there were some very nice cherry blossoms still when we visited); perhaps we were a few days early or late after the full bloom.As it was sunny and hot in the daytime even in Spring, would recommend to visit the palace grounds in the early mornings or in the late afternoons.Would also recommend to rent a hanbok and wear to the palace grounds. For 10000 won for 2 hours, you get a more memorable experience of what it was like to live in the palace and wearing traditional Korean clothes. What's more, it's free entry for those wearing hanboks (otherwise, you would need to pay 1000 won per entry at each palace). We did not feel strange walking down the streets in our hanboks, as it seemed normal for tourists and even locals to wear hanboks to visit the palaces. The hanbok rental shop closest to Changgyeonggung Palace, is a 10min walk from the Palace. After alighting from Hyehwa subway station, take exit 4. Thereafter, walk down Daemyeong-gil shopping street for about 200 metres until you reach a major road, Changgyeonggung-ro. Cross the road. Walk down about 30 metres until you reach a black-beige building (photo enclosed). You should find a banner on the building advertising for hanbok rental. The shop is on the 4th floor, reachable only by stairs. The lady owner is very friendly and can speak simple English, and she will gladly assist you on how to wear the traditional hanbok.After renting your hanbok, walk down the same direction for another 10 minutes until you reach the Changgyeonggung main gate entrance, and enjoy your walk around the Palace. In your hanbok, you could also enter Changdeokgung Palace for free from the back of Changgyeonggung, via Hamyangmun gate.", April 2017
153,4.0,Great historic place,"If you have half a day to spare in Seoul, go and visit this palace. It's the only palace you need to see in Seoul. Great when there is no rain, you can wander the grounds, relax in the shades of the trees or watch the fish in the ponds.", May 2016

Good Fun", December 2016
157,4.0,Quiet. Serene and sadness radiates from the grounds. Different from the other palaces. ,"We bought the palace combination ticket and this one was in the 4 palaces on the ticket.nearest train station is Hyehwa. Takes about 15-20 min from the station to the palace so do plan your time. We went for the English guided tour. Think it's very recommended as you get to know the sad history of the place and where some of the events happened. We went in the late afternoon time. The place was quiet. Only a few visitors. It was nice and a refreshing change from being in crowded spaces. It was nice to walk around the garden and admire the buildings despite its past history being somewhat sad. One thing to note : there's only 1 public toilet area on the palace grounds which is some 200m away from the entrance (inside the grounds) , if you are urgent... It's abit difficult! We were there in winter, the path to the toilet was icy and snowy, slippery and wet. It was a difficult 200m! But on the whole, I really liked this palace. It had a certain feel to it. Can't describe it but alluring.", February 2017
158,3.0,Get to a little about Korean History,"If you don't have anything to do then you should spend a half-day to walk around the palace. Basically, it is very similar to another palace in Hue, Vietnam. It is too old and it is not very clean. I guess this is because it is overcrowded with people, especially Chinese tourists. I was there and walked around with a tour guide, she was very nice, but at the end, she started crying because of the history of how the Japanese had killed their last king. I thought that was a bit over-dramatic and unnecessary. I think she was trying to convey to the Chinese tourists that China and Korea have the same enemy: Japan. The war has been over for a very long time, but with their attitude, the Koreans are still divisive.", August 2016
159,5.0,so much to admire,"love the roof lines, the colorful corbels, etc. - great photo ops.it was originally built as a secondary palace to the main one. The buildings are constructed of wood and set on stone platforms. Many feature tiled hipped roofs with a corbelled multi-bracket system and ornamental carvings. Simply delightful.The palaces were burnt down during the Japanese invasion in the late 16th century. This was the first one to be reconstructed, and since then served as the main seat of the dynasty for 250 years.", January 2017

162,3.0,Other Palace's are better,This was my third Palace and I was getting a bit palaced out. The restoration was not quite as good. The paint work was not so impressive and some of the panels were just plain red. The decorations inside the buildings no so impressive. If you are in Seoul for a while the sure put it on the itinerary but keep it down the lower end of the too list., January 2017
163,5.0,MUST VISIT especially the Secret Garden Tour,"This is a MUST visit place in Seoul. I had been to this palace 2 times and still want to go back again. To be honest, I prefer this palace even more than Gyeongbokgung Palace. Don't miss the Secret Garden tour as all the hidden gems are inside. Most of every corner in the secret garden tour are picturesque. The best season for visit (in my opinion) is fall when all the tree are red. Again, don't miss this place!!", December 2016
164,3.0,Nothing much except for the main building,"Located side-by-side with Changdeokgung and ""slightly less grand"" in stature than that palace (by stature, I mean the overall size of the palace grounds & the number of buildings on the premises; and yes by those measures, both of these palaces are ""way less"" in their statures than the main palace Gyeongbokgung), there's really nothing much to see at this palace except for its main palace building with the throne stage inside which can only be looked at from right outside the big room just as at all the other palaces (except at Deoksugung where the main building can be entered for a close-up view of the throne stage).  One thing you might like to do here though which cannot be found at the other palaces (except at Changdeokgung's Secret Garden although not quite the same because that's a ""guided tour"") is a nice stroll on your own at your own pace in the wood right beside the main palace building (just go out the corridor on the left side while facing the main palace building), and also another ""unique thing"" I noticed at this palace is a building on the palace grounds that people can actually go in and sit down on the floor for a good rest if you so wish (no such building on palace grounds ""for resting"" can be found at any of the other palaces!).Coming by subway, Jongno 5-ga Station (on line 1) is where to get off followed by about a 15-minute walk north to get here, but this palace really should be done ""in conjunction"" with Changdeokgung (specifically by using the ""back exit"" of Changdeokgung right beside its Secret Garden entrance which will lead to the high ground overlooking the grounds of this palace & where there are stairs to come down); and the nearest metro station for Changdeokgung is Anguk (on Line 3) from which it's just about a 5-minute walk straight east on the big street Yulguk-ro to the entrance gate of Changdeokgung.And what I suggest for the ticket is just getting an ""integrated ticket"" for 10,000 won (the equivalent of 10 US dollars) which is good for like a month and which covers this palace & three others (namely the main palace Gyeongbokgung, Deoksugung & yes Changdeokgung right beside this palace as mentioned above) plus Jongmyo Shrine also just in the vicinity of this palace; just do keep in mind that this palace along with Changdeokgung & Deoksugung are closed on Mondays, and the main palace Gyeongbokgung & Jongmyo Shrine are closed on Tuesdays.", June 2016
165,4.0,Neat place to visit.,"Neat place to visit, but if you have to choose between this and Changdeokgung palace, go to the latter. If you want to visit the Secret Garden within the palace complex, you should reserve your tour tickets in advance, especially if you are going during a popular tourist season. Rent a hanbok from one of the stores across the street to heighten the fun and to receive free admission.", January 2017
166,5.0,One of my favourite palaces in Seoul.,"Changyeonggung Palace is at the rear of Changdeokgung Palace, although there is also a main entrance opposite Seoul University Hospital.

168,5.0,Impressive palace!,"My friends and I had joined the Huwon English tour (cost me 8,000 won in total). The participants of the tour seems not restricted to number of people per tour, so it might get a little packed. The Huwon (secret garden) is impressive with palace, lakes and leaves which makes me feel peace. Preferred to join tour while walking around the palace if you like history stuff because without the explanation you may feel lost and all palace may looks same to you.", November 2016
169,4.0,Beautiful Palace with a sad history,"It is better to buy the Combination ticket that costs W10,000 and gives admission to 5 sites and Secret Garden. When we arrived, we were greeted by a volunteer guide. She took us around the palace, explaining the features and history of the palace and telling us stories about the Japanese attempts to erode the Korean legacy during the Colonial period.After the guided tour, you are free to roam around the palace ground.

176,4.0,Beautiful place artistically manged,Typical Korean royal architecture to see here. It is a large and wide area to spend more than two hours. The change of guards in the morning and then the inside area with other buildings are really worth visiting to get a feel of royal korean culture., November 2016

178,5.0,A must-see in autumn whilst in Seoul,"I visited the palace in late Oct. 2016 after visiting the Secret Garden of Changdeokgung. There is an entrance to Changgyeonggung right next to the Secret Garden entrance. This is very handy ie without having to go around a long way to the main entrance of Changgyeonggung. In autumn, the place is stunning with trees changing colours. There are two ponds at the rear worth visiting. The greenhouse is under renovation so I shall see it another time. The palace buildings are not so grand but the garden is great. One should see the Secret Garden of Changdeokgung and the Changgyeonggung together for a full experience of autumn palace beauty. For the former, one needs good planning ie to book the ticket 6 days in advance on internet (and you have to be quick as the bookings are all gone in 15 minutes or so, and the website is heavily jammed at those times).", October 2016
179,3.0,Very small,"It's very small, not that much to see, I spent 30 minutes here, it's enough. If you don't have that much time in Seoul, this one can skip.", November 2016

182,4.0,Seems to be similar but its totaly different from other,"Its strongly recommended to buy combined ticket for all the palaces (5) - 10 000 W and try the guided tour. Its free, all guides speak fluent english and explain all that you can see. Palace seems to be similar to other ones so Its really useful to have a guided tour which explain all the differences and show you what makes this one really different from the other 4.", October 2016
183,5.0,Fascinating!,If you wanted to know more about Korea and their culture then this is the place to be. They offer guided tours but they also have the app on which you could follow through the whole area., September 2016
184,5.0,Beautiful Palace and Garden,"The palace is quite lovely, especially the painted buildings and ceilings.  But the real bonus is he Secret Garden which is lovely.  Take the guided tour of both and you will learn history while you enjoy the beauty of this place.  A couple hours is all you need.", October 2016
185,5.0,Beautiful Place,"This was my first time to visit this palace in Korea.  It was a guided English speaking tour.  The tour guide was speaks very good english and very knowledgeable of the palace history.  Unbelieavable place to see most of the original building and things inside the palace.  Our tour company made the reservations for the guided tour and they informed us that its difficult to get in.  Compared to the other palaces in Korea, I believe this is the best one.  The secret garden tour is after the palace tour.  The garden tour is also nice but a lot of iphill and downhill walking so bring good walking shoes during this tour.", October 2016

187,5.0,Fascinating Glimpse into Korean Past,"The Palace gave an interesting glimpse into the lives of the Korean rulers from years past.  Fascinating, particularly the methods of heating the buildings and the intricate decorations.  And the landscaping was simply magnificent.  I particularly liked the waterfalls where Korean rulers and their guests would write poetry and send the poems sailing down the streams.", November 2015

189,3.0,"Nice, but not as good as other palaces/temples in Seoul","This was nice to see, but the site did not meet my expectations.  Additionally, the extra money for the secret garden was not worth it in my opinion.  Afterwards, do walk around the neighborhoods, where there are nice crafts stores, restaurants, and artists.", October 2016
190,4.0,Big gate. Big garden inside. Historical building.,The reviewers' pictures tell the story. The gate is big and tall. It is best to study up and google about its history before you come. It will be more meaningful if you are well versed with the history. Or get a guide to explain to youthe history and the story behind the buildings.There is a garden . Good to sit around to relax and admire the beautiful lake.. There are less tourist here when I was there. Nice palce to do brisk walking exercise to as there are plenty of trees for shades in the summer. Definitely a place for photo bugs., August 2016

192,4.0,You need to plan in advance,"It is possible visiting the palace only with a guide and there is only some hours for the english guide, so it's better to inform about the hours unless you are korean speaking. It is worth a visit , so suggestive and exciting even with kids ( good walker kids!) , it is full of garden and trees so even in the summer it is pleasant to walk in.", August 2016
193,4.0,A palace like a peacefu garden,"Several palaces in Seoul. The most evisited is Gyeongbokung and the Secret Garden in Changdeokgung. I visited Changgeonggung quite long time ago, but much less times than the other two. Comapre to Gyeongbok or Secret Garden in Changdeok, it is less various things to look around however, very quite, tranquille, peaceful place. I like the pond(Chundangji) and its octangonal stone pagoda. Good to take a walk around feeling serenity. Thesedays, there is special exhibition of King Jeongjo(ruling Dinasty from1777-1800).It was amazing to watch King's own writing in old Korean which is still readible and understandable even for me, contemporary human being, who live now! He was such a good king and talenated for the arts too!!  If you like quiet place from the busy city life, pls try to visit here. This palace is linked to Chengdeokgung in the middle, so you can enter that palace, paying the ticket there.", September 2016

197,5.0,A wonderful day out with a wonderful guide.,We visited one morning and were just in time for the English speaking tour. We were the only two on the tour and the tour guide was very informative and friendly. She made it such a pleasant tour. We spent most of the day here as there is a lot to see and also places to relax. There is a botanic garden with a greenhouse but the green house was under renovation and so it wasn't open., August 2016
198,4.0,"Vast, pleasant and less visited than Changdeokgung","By chance, we visited this palace before the adjacent one, Changdeokgung. Doing the reverse would possibly not be as enjoyable, as Korean palace buildings are very similar and Changdeokgung is he grandest of them all. This one, built to house the relatives of the king, had very few visitors when we were there. It offers an elaborate ceremonial bridge over the symbolic river (okcheongyo), large park areas, a very poetic small lake with an middle island and plenty of ducks, a small peculiar monument in the forest (taesilbi) and at the far end of the park, a wildflower garden and a Victorian-style greenhouse (under renovation until November 2017).", May 2016
199,5.0,Quiet and peaceful,"I had been walking for a long time in the busy streets of Seoul and decided to give it a try - paid 1000 won and entered a beautiful palace. Automatically you are cut off from the traffic outside and surrounded by nature and serenity, plus once more beautiful architecture from the past. Basically is you are looking for a place to walk around in nature where architecture is present as well - this is the place to go.", July 2016
200,5.0,Great,"The Palace is quite big. Get there at the changing of the guards, it's worth it. We walked along the walkway leading to the Palace and saw a K-Pop group filming. Fun.", May 2016
201,4.0,Must do!,"This was my favorite cultural stop in Seoul. The palace is huge and you can easily spend a few hours there, especially if you go to the museum (free) that is toward the back of the property. Rated 4 stars because there is not much to do aside from walk around and see the structures, as far as I could tell. However, the architecture is beautiful and detailed. There is an area specifically for children, too. A low-price activity that is rich in culture. Highly recommend!", February 2016
202,5.0,GO TO SEOUL YOUNG MAN/WOMEN..MY FIRST TIME IN SEOUL.THIS IS A GREAT PLACE/CITY !!!,"I wanted to express my humbe opinion about this place..( SEOUL..)

( cant compare here... every place has its own ""specialty""...", June 2016
203,3.0,Next to Changdeokgung Palace but not as good.,"Changgyonggung Palace is minutes away form Changdeokgung Palace.  Changgyongung is smaller and doesn't have as many interesting things to see as Changdeokgung.  I didn't go on the guided tour so it's possible I would've enjoyed it if a guide explained the grounds to me.  Since it's so close to Changdeokgung, I think it's worth a visit and would be better if you can join one of the guided tours.", October 2015
204,3.0,Not much to see,The Palace is like all other average palaces and venues in seoul. Maybe we went little late in our trip so did not find much attraction. There are some parts with some historical importance and a huge park for walking. Little expensive for tourists., June 2016
205,5.0,A Must See Attraction,"Take time to visit the palace.  you won't be disappointed.  If available to you, stay for the changing of the guard ceremonies. Very colorful and interesting.  Stay afterwards for fotos with the guards.", June 2016
206,4.0,Changgyeonggung Palace(s) Compound.,"Changgyeonggung Palace(s)  The name is hard for me to pronounce correctly the way Koreans say it.Entrance fee is around $12, but free for seniors. The compound is so vast that you should prepare for a bit of walking and get an umbrella if it is a rainy day to enjoy the surroundings.", June 2016
207,5.0,A treasure of history,This palace is connected to Changdeokgung near an entrance by the Hiwon (secret garden) area in the aforementioned location. It is similar to other palaces in that it has a wide expanse of land it claims. You'll need at least an hour and a half to walk around and see everything. The real treat was the Victorian style green house tucked away in the back. It was under construction when I visited but they had a lovely garden nearby you could walk through as you walked around the pond on the palace grounds. The buildings are somewhat understated when compared to Changdeokgung and Gyeonbokgung but it still has an austere beauty and charm to it that shouldn't be missed., June 2016
208,5.0,Amaze Yourself,Fantastic history! Not sure what else to tell you. It is just one of those places you need to go to and experience yourself and try and image what the dynasty was really like!, May 2016
209,4.0,NIce spot to visit to see Joseon Dynasty era buildings and grounds.,"We only had time for one of the two major palaces, and we chose Changgyeonggung because royalty had actually lived there and we thought it would be a little less crowded. We also wanted to see the ""secret garden,"" which you have to book online in advance. We had guided tours of the central grounds and the very unique gardens. It was quite a lot of walking, which could be problematic in very hot weather, although the garden is very shady. We loved getting a taste of royal life in this last of the Korean dynasties. There is even a house where the last member of the family lived until the 1980s. The palace is also right next to Bukchon Village, another good site.", May 2016
210,4.0,Very Interesting Place.,"The first time I was here, my kids were younger so we did not spend a lot of time here.  But this time I did not have them, so I got a chance to go through the Palace at a slower pace and really enjoy the surroundings.  This is a neat place to explore and understand the history of Korea. Lots of things to see.", October 2015
211,4.0,Changgyeonggung Palace,"Very interesting Palace, enjoyed the tour guides commentaries. Interesting to note the statues on the roofs.

212,5.0,Amazing,"I went there last week on Children's Day and they had a performance of several actors who played the royal family and their guards and servants, it was so nuch fun to watch! We then walked around the palace area and there's a gorgeous lake, too. It was great weather and not even that crowded. A must-go.", May 2016
213,5.0,Maps are not accurate,"The official Seoul turist map suggests that the entrance to this Palace is on the south-west corner of the park. However once you go through the main gate you end up in the other Palace. You can get between the palaces without exiting the park but if you don't know which palace you're in it's much harder to navigate. Palace itself is nice but not as good as the other one. I would not make it my priority. The ""G"" Palace is much nicer so go there i stead if you have limitted time.", May 2016
214,5.0,"great, especially when uncrowded","I visited on a Sunday morning when there were no school visits, and the weather was perfect.  A lovely place.", April 2016
215,5.0,Worth a visit. ,"Just been there this afternoon under a very rainy day unfortunately. Nonetheless, we enjoyed the walk with some photo shoots. The lush greenery and accented with colourful flowers made our day worth the wet stroll. The cold wind chilled our body but we didn't give up admiring all the historical wooden architecture and amazing stone works that adorn the entire place. They also offer English tour guide to let you understand better about its history.The entrance fee is very cheap (W1,000) and the entrance is close to hyehwa metro station line 4.", May 2016

Allow at least an hour. The palace is free to people 65 and older.", April 2016
218,4.0,Small but very peaceful ,"This palace and gardens is beautiful in Spring. There are many flowers blooming, and plenty of old trees. The palace itself has some beautiful painting work but otherwise isn't very interesting, but the walk through the gardens made it worthwhile. Very peaceful in the middle of Seoul. There were a lot of school groups there when I visited (9.30am) but it didn't put me off as they were pretty well behaved. Entrance costs 1000 won (about $1.10 AUD) which is super cheap.", March 2016
219,4.0,Lovely insight to Korean culture,"Beautiful buildings and rich heritage, good way to learn about the culture and custom of S Korea, very interesting", April 2016
220,4.0,Beautiful Grounds andPalance in the heart of the city,Spring is definitely a great time to visit any Palace in Seoul as the spring blossoms in full bloom are so love!y and plentiful.  I would also imagine a fall visit would also be as spectacular as the the autumn colours take hold.  The grounds are very ?argeso plantjme to walk around.The Palace itself is quite nice and was designed primarily as a residence for elders of the royal family to live.  Beside to pick up the brochure explaining all this as you go through the entry way.  It is very cheap to go in and free if you're 65+.This Palace is defiy worth a visit., April 2016
221,4.0,Don't miss the Secret Garden,Changgyeonggung Palace and its secret garden is well worth a visit. English speaking tours take place several times a day.

224,5.0,Palace grounds,We couldn't wait 3 hours to get into Secret garden which was separate admission fee and time. Otherwise very reasonable admission price. Palace grounds are smaller than other palace nearby. Separate buildings house administrative govt and king. Good historical sight in middle of city., March 2016
225,5.0,Smaller than some of the oher Palaces in Seoul,"There are four major Palaces in Seoul, and you can get a combined ticket to see all four and Jongmyo Shrine.  All are in pretty much the same area - in fact Changgyeonggung (there's really no need to add the word ""Palace"", as ""gung"" means ""Palace"", but the guidebooks do it to make it easier for English speakers like me!) is right next door to Changdeokgung, and there's an entry between the two (with a ticket office - you need to have the combined ticket book [10,000Won] or buy a ticket for both, but at least you don't need to go back out and walk round the wall to the other's entry!).All Palaces are readily accessible via the Metro.This one is smaller than a couple of the others, but still very pretty, in good condition, and with pleasant gardens.", March 2016

228,5.0,Has a rich culture behind it.,Changgyeonggung Palace has a lot of backstory indicated on the plates per room on the whole yard. This makes walking and looking at the rooms a more fulfilling as you know its value as a historical site., February 2016

232,4.0,Small and nice.,This palace is smaller than Changdeonkgung and Gyeongbokgung but is well maintained and has fewer European tourists. It is easily assessable from the east side of Changdeonkgung palace either from the street or through the palace its self. The entrance fee minamal (1000 won) and well worth a look although not as impressive as other palaces., February 2016
233,3.0,Worth the Visit,"This is not as great a palace as you might find in a place like China, but this is certainly worth including in your Seoul visit.  I've been here a couple times, and still recommend it.", July 2015

237,5.0,Small and feeling of nature,"Changgyeonggung is another palace of main 5 palaces. Also, it's smaller than Gyeongbokgung or Changdeokgung and very similar to other palaces. But if you like traditional buildings, Changgyeonggung is a must place to visit in Seoul. Not only you can see traditional buildings, but also you can sit near those buildings and eat your snacks or lunch. Also, it's like a park, so you can feel free to imagine that you are on picnic. I visited palace in rainy stormy day, but it still was very beautiful. And you can see a lot of korean couples with traditional clothes and elder people drinking soju. It's really nice place to feel old Korea and feel the nature~", June 2015
238,5.0,You need to catch the specific time for English Guide or don't Go,"Well suggesting English One Guided tour twice a day, is nothing compared to the number of people and the attendance all the time, i was fortunate i didn't get a Guide, so done the tour, then the search later on by my own", August 2015
239,4.0,Cool attraction in Seoul,When I went I got to see the changing of the guard ceremony. It was very epic and took about 15-20 mins to complete. Got some cool photos and videos. The guard where traditional ceremonial warrior garb and stand motionless and still out in front of the entrance to the palace. It's pretty cool that they still carry the tradition. The palace is very impressive. It's so big you can barely take a picture of it. Definitely check it out., January 2015
240,5.0,Stunning!,"This place should probably be at the top of everyone's to do list in Seoul. However, this palace is only one of several that span about 2 or km back. If you want to see all the palaces and the grounds be sure to allow at least half a day, if not more. Also, be prepared for lots of walking. But it's all worth it because the ceremonies and palaces are so very unique!!!!!", April 2015
241,5.0,A less visited palace,"This was by far my favourite of the main palaces in Seoul. It feels a   bit hidden away from the main temples and as a result was much quieter than the others. Like all other temples in the area, this one has been extremely well restored", December 2015

243,4.0,"Simple, relax","It is a small palace in Seoul. It's used to be part of Changdeokgung palace. These two palaces is quite far from the subway (but still in walkable distance). For those who don't want to walk uphill, I recommend to visit these palaces in the same day. First --> Changdeokgung, then go through the small gate (near the secret garden entrance) to the Changgyeonggung. You can go by the subway and then get on the bus (with T money card, there is no bus fare). There is a small number of visitors in this palace. So you can find peace when wandering around. It has a 1-hr free guided tour (two times a day). The guide will wear traditional ""Hanbok"" and wait for the tourists near the bridge inside the gate. She speaks fluent English. I visited this palace 4 times in 2 years. I think guide tour is better than walking around on your own.", October 2015
244,5.0,Must be visited !,Worth to be visited and to read the explanation about how Korean kings used to rule! Not that crowded as Changdeokgung Place. There is a gate to enter Changdeokgung Palace from the park of Changgueonggung Palace which is not explicitly mentioned on the maps., November 2015

247,4.0,Another Palace that's worth a visit!,"Originally built as living quarters, especially for dowager queens, rather than as a throne hall, while not as huge as the rest of the 4 palaces, this place is definitely huge and worth a visit for its rich history, its stunning and peaceful parks. Right in the city centre. One of my favourite palaces.  Do remember to visit the nearby Changdeokgung Palace as both palaces were known to be the East Palaces. Both palaces shared the same rear garden.", September 2015

253,5.0,One of the larger palace grounds which will need more time to cover major sections,"The historic context behind this palace is unmistakable - this is the 3rd palace compound to be built in the Josen dynasty.  Beyond the standard palace architecture and facade, there's a expansive garden attached to the palace which used by many locals as their ideal location to chat under the shady trees.  There's a large lake at the end of the gardens which provides a great setting for Instagram photos.  That is why you'll need more time to cover every section of this palace.", October 2015

255,4.0,Palace and Secret Garden,"We were there at 3:30 PM and avoided the crowd and enjoyed ourselves roaming around the grounds taking pictures of the beautiful architecture/landscape (and some Koreans in their splendid Hanbok) . A very grand & beautiful palace. We missed the English tour & joined the Korean group to the Secret Garden. (you are required to be accompanied on this 90-min tour). After 10 minutes, my husband and I asked to catch up with  the English one and were ""allowed"" to do so. Beware of steep hills / steps inside the Secret garden - wear comfortable shoes. Our tour guide walked fast and we were ""out of breath"" on some parts.", October 2015
256,3.0,An interesting amalgamation of several different sights,"It is very difficult to pin this place down as a sight; it is as much wooded trails and a lake as it is a palace.  The palace is, itself, very low key - almost like an afterthought.  There are no buildings worthy of special mention, although is set amid a quite pretty, hilly landscape.As you venture northeast, you suddenly find yourself amid hilly, wooded trails which beckon you to follow them.  There is a very pleasant, nice sized lake replete with an island and a resident heron of some sort.  Heading further on, you will come upon a white, atrium-style hothouse with an assortment of flora.If it were wrapped up in the admission fee for Changdeokgung Palace, one might be able to stretch this to a 4 star attraction but it’s their insistence on a separate entrance fee that lands it squarely in the “Average” category.", September 2015
257,5.0,Very impressive cultural place to visit,This is a site you shouldn't miss... Even if you don;t have much time go there and see for yourself the history of Seoul., September 2015
258,4.0,Another Joseon Palace,"Palace within another palace ground , I consider this a lived-on palace being built for a Queen and a retired King Taejo. Nice to walk in , compact and within the Anguk area.", September 2015
259,4.0,Secret Garden disappointing,We enjoyed the tour of the Palace in English but found the over-hyped Secret Garden disappointing. There was a huge group of us and it felt we were all being herded and the grounds had nice trees but little atmosphere with all the people., September 2015
260,5.0,Beautiful Korean traditional palace. Stunning in spring and autumn.,"One of the best Korean traditional palace. In this palace, flowers and trees are very beautiful especially in spring and autumn. Especially around Biwon, about 20~30 minutes from the main gate has stunning view and I think this place is one of the most beautiful place in Seoul. Definitely worth a visit.", October 2014
261,4.0,Beautiful Palace,Historical palace in the historical district within Seoul City center. Close to main road and accessible to public transportation, August 2015
262,5.0,Honestly speaking,this palace is sort of attached to to Changdeokgung and i hadn't even realized when i had gone from one to the other but it was all really beautiful., May 2015
263,5.0,Huge  palace,The best preserved of the five palaces of the nose on dyansty and is world heritage site by unesco . It's Good to go on a tour so you learn the history of the palace . They have tours in English at only certain times of the day we went at 4 pm, September 2015
264,5.0,Another excellent landmark,"Seoul does such a wonderful job maintaining and integrating life around these great palaces.  This one is no different.  And it is in easy walking distance from Gyungbuk palace (big one near blue house), insa-dong, bukchon, etc...Make it part of a great day in Seoul", September 2015
265,5.0,Big Palace.,"Big Palace, inexpensive admission fee. Guard had the stand-off almost not real, Garden and home are nice.", August 2015
266,5.0,Very Interesting History,"Fantastic, great history,can get up close to the houses,can't go inside but a great view and photo opportunity from the outside.We had a guide who was so knowlagble with his history, we were fascinated with the information.", July 2015
267,5.0,A Journey Back in Time,Beautiful colors shining in the sunlight and fascinating stories of times gone by.  A must see if you are in Seoul, February 2015
268,5.0,Best Palace of Korea,"This is not the main palace, but I think Changgyeonggung is the most beautiful, well-organized palace. Never miss it. Also it is well-preserved. You can take a walk along the palace.", January 2015
269,4.0,Gorgeous,"like the other palaces of Seoul, this is a great place to learn about the culture/history of Korea. Personally I think this was the best palace we had visited because the nature walk here was really long and very pleasant", August 2015
270,4.0,Spectacular greenhouse,"The palace buildings are nothing special compared to the other palaces that you can visit in Seoul, including Changdeokgung next door.  The highlight for me is the early 20th century greenhouse, which is a beautiful structure in its own right and worth the admission price.  The plants are nice, too.", August 2015
271,4.0,Nice tour with a beautiful stroll,Family with a baby we enjoyed the beauty and stroll around the garden.  We did the English tour and enjoyed our tour guide.  We came in the early spring., March 2015
272,5.0,"Neighbors Changdeokgung, hit them both, two for one!","I wouldn't call this a must see, but I must say that I really enjoyed it despite the biting cold. One thing I love about Seoul's historical attractions is that they include free English tours, you just have to make sure you have the times right and that you are on time. I found the tour to be fun, interesting, and very informative. Really, don't miss the tour, it is 70% of the experience. I found it more interesting than the main palace, Gyeongbukgong, equally beautiful, and much less crowded.", November 2014
273,5.0,Beautiful palace with a secret garden,"Recommend to go for the secret garden tour. We caught the English tour and boy it was a sight to see. Apparently you are not allowed to go in without the tour guide. The guide was really good and we were immersed in the past as we visited places the kings used to sit with his men and drink tea and where princes used to read etc. If you could only go to one palace, please do visit this one. Its also less touristy than Gyeongbukgung Palace.", June 2015
274,3.0,Looking its age,"I visited all of the palaces and this one was the only one to show signs of age - lots of peeling and fading paintwork and a few buildings completely surrounded by scaffolding for restoration works. There is nothing unique about Changgyeonggung Palace as it has the same layout of entry gate, courtyard, throne room and outbuildings as all of the other palaces do. It is only worth a visit if you are nearby, are really interested in Korean architecture/history or need to fill in time in your itinerary.", July 2015
275,5.0,Beautiful park in Seoul South Korea,"Really cool place to visit and check out if your in Seoul,,,,lots of history and great people watching too!!", February 2015
276,2.0,Skip the Secret Garden,"You think that you need a reservation to visit the Secret Garden, since it claim it only takes 50 people. However this is not true. When we visit it there were over 150 people with one guide. They claim it is a Secret Garden, it is not. It is the Palace ground that required a 3 mile hike, some of it steep grade. Totally not worth it. A complete waste of time and monies. A garden have a meaning of flowers, good luck finding one.", May 2015
277,5.0,Serene,This palace is the most quiet one among the five major palaces. Not as crowded as Changdeokgung Palace. My sister and I were the only people there when we visited this place., December 2014
278,5.0,Very beautiful,"A very beautiful palace and palace grounds. Had a very lovely walk in the August heat, where we checked out the palace itself and then had a nice stroll throughout the park grounds. It is not as impressive as other palaces might be, but it is wonderful to look at either way.", August 2014
279,5.0,"Excellent, especially with the Reenactment","I was lucky because I was there when there was a little reenactment about the daily life of the palace. We had to write our name in a wooder ID card and showed it to the guard before entering the gate. The king, the queen, the guards... they looked really real, and played really well. I've been there 2 times, and the 1st one I joined with the tour and she explained the palace really well, about the philosophy of the palaces, about the differences between the building for the woman and any other building. Nice.", May 2015
280,4.0,A palace in a botanical park,"The palace served as the residence for three dowager queens so when you look up to the ceiling in the throne hall, there is a pair of phoenix , unlike the other 3 palaces where you see a pair of dragons. As with the other palaces, first you enter through the main entrance where the ticketing office is, then you go through the door leading to the Throne Hall.  In the big open courtyard, there are 2 rows of stone markers where court officials had to stand according to their ranking and waited to meet the king. The Throne like in the other palaces is the place where kings are crowned, met foreign envoys and court officials to conduct affairs of the state. There are many tall pine trees so it is very cooling walking in the park after visiting the Throne Hall. You would not miss the octagonal seven storied stone pagoda and the Chungdangji pond.walking further to the back, you would not fail to see a white wooden building, the botanical glasshouse. Going inside, you will be impressed by the many bonsai on display.", May 2015
281,4.0,worth a visit,Like most palaces in Seoul with the same architecture. Needs only one hour to go around . It was not crowded and was easy to reach. The information given was mostly in Korean and we had to ask for English pamphlets., April 2015
282,4.0,Quaint palace,"Cool palace.  One of the smaller ones, so less crowded, but still cool to check out.  I believe this is where the changing of the guard begins as it moves through the city to the main palace.", November 2014
283,3.0,ok f you are looking for history,it's very touristy and i am sorry i feel that everything was surreal.this palace is a part of a very big palace complex which we didn't gone to cover it...for some reason we didnt' get the information of the history of the palace and what's conclude. so if the tourism of Korea could give me more knowledge of the palace i could have appreciate it more., September 2014
284,4.0,Seems Bigger than the what you get to see at Forbidden City in Beijing,"The change of guards ceremony is colorful and loud with drums and draws a crowd.As you walk through the different sections all the way to the back where the ladies resided you realize how spare and bare life was. No toilets, limited heating/cooling.", March 2015
285,4.0,Best of the Best in Seoul,It is the biggest and the most beautiful palace.  The main gate is great also.  The roofs inside are painted in unique style with colorful colors and designs.  All the buildings are in good conditions along long walk ways., March 2015
286,5.0,favorite palace in Seoul,"compare to Gyeongbokgung Palace, I much preferred this one! It's less visited as it's less popular, therefore it's so serene, quiet and simply majestic. It's referred as the East palace of Gyeongbokgung and what makes this East palace so much more special is how all the buildings of Changdeokgung blend perfectly with the natural topography of the site instead of imposing themselves upon it- therefore all the structures of this palace have a perfect flow with its own natural surroundings.Breath taking palace and far less crowded so you can really take your time to take it all in!", April 2014
287,4.0,Adjacent to Changduk-palace,you can literally walk into the place though the back-gate of Changduk-palace. But still need to buy the ticket., October 2014
288,4.0,Free Hanbok Testing for 3 Minutes,"This palace is much smaller, but the scenery is beautiful when you visit during Autumn. There are many photogenic spot you can find and to take gorgeous pictures.", October 2014
289,3.0,Guard Changing was OK,"I have to say, the Guards were all actors. It was OK to watch but you have not missed anything if you missed it.", February 2015
290,5.0,The place to visit,The most well preserved Korean palace and it offers the historic appreciation of Korea and Korean culture.Guided tours are available and it is a beautiful palace., April 2014
291,4.0,Nice,"Massive area to cover, but overall all the buildings are relatively the same. You can't go inside, only look from outside. In winter it gets cold doing such activity. Nonetheless worth going to. Not like indoor palaces of England or Turkey.", January 2015
292,4.0,Book a free tour!,"MRT: Exit 4 of Hyehwa Station, walk for 10mins.  Glad that we book the city walking tour at visitseoul.net for a free tour guide!", January 2015
293,4.0,A very peaceful place (if not too many tourists about)!,I visited this Palace (along with the neighbouring Changdeokgung Palace) at the end of November 2014 whilst on a work related trip to Korea.  In my opinion this Palace is not as beautiful or a grand as it's neighbour but it does have more of a tranquil feel to it as you walk, November 2014
294,2.0,Beautiful place,"Easy walk, beautiful area, many corners to take photos. Family friendly location. Get in early to join the tour, bright your hat : ) and good shoes. You need more than 3 hours to walk around.", April 2014
295,5.0,Meditative Place: D,"I'd had a shockingly bad experience when I was in Seoul. After I was kind of wandering the city a bit of a mess, and I got off the tour bus at Changgyeonggung Palace without really thinking about it. At first I thought it was just a big court yard with a couple nice buildings", February 2014
296,5.0,Truely well-kept history structures,"It was amazing with the beautiful landscape and wonderful well kept history structures. You can also get storytellings about the palace. I visited there in summer, it was really cool and impressive.", July 2014
