0,1.0,Bad reviews are true. Paid the price.,"Paid the price of losing to learn through the hard way. This place is designed for you to lose. This casino is not big at all. If you want maximum fun and win some money, go to Singapore's Resort World or Marina Bay Sands. They are 10 times bigger.  1) Minimum bet for Blackjack", November 2019
1,5.0,Very Happy.,, September 2019
2,2.0,"Small, smokey, full of rude Chinese nationals","I went last night with the intention of playing low buy-in blackjack, not only did I not get to play blackjack because there was an entire family of Chinese nationals who would call someone over to hold the seat when ever anyone left FOR HOURS, when I finally decided to play poker the other guests (again all Chinese nationals) were very rude and making cusses at me all night. The place itself is alright, very small with few low value tables operating, the staff were reasonable civil and provided free water when requested, but the room smelt strongly of smoke due to the smoko rooms at ether end which were regularly opened into the main area. I guess its better than nothing, but I will not be going back.", August 2019
3,1.0,Female dealers are very rude and gossipy,, April 2019
4,1.0,Terrible service ,Terrible service towards foreigners.  Been going for months due to no other casinos in the area but will never go again. Terrible customer service and discriminating towards foreigners, October 2018
5,1.0,Terrible staff attitude toward foreigners,Terrible staff attitude towards foreigners whom they donâ€™t understand because the crowd is largely korean speaking Chinese. The staff are really rude and it was really bad experience to entertain guests or clients. Secondly the dealer Shin GoKyun would accuse you of something bad because he cannot understand English and accuse you to the manager. I knew this because I could understand korean too. Such a shame and liar., July 2018

12,2.0,Like anywhere in Korea don't tip. The owner keeps the money not the workers.,It is OK.  It isn't what you expect.  There is very little English spoken if though no Koreans are allowed inside.  The over all experience is pretty dull at Walker., June 2015
13,1.0,"Poor Service, Terrible Staff and Unfriendly atmosphere...",, April 2015
14,4.0,"Serves the purpose, if you're looking to gamble while in SK",, November 2014
15,2.0,Boring,"If you are looking for a Vegas-style casino that features people actually having fun, keep looking.  This place is simply boring.   Plenty of people there, but you could drop a pin and hear it land.  Dealers are not especially friendly, there are no craps tables, and the atmosphere in general is just dull - no locals are allowed so that adds to the disappointment.  Save you money and do something fun in Seoul...", December 2014

17,5.0,Great Casino. I think it's the only one for foreigners in Korea.,Korean friends are not allowed inside the casino.  But a nice way to spend a night with the buddies. I hear the concerts they have every now and then are pretty awesome and feature well-known artists., February 2012
