0,3.0,Don’t bother in Winter,"Really cool place but if you’re travelling in Winter I would skip it. It’s not the same, very dull to see. In summer it’ll be a better  experience for you. ", January 2020
1,4.0,It is good to see at night,I strongly recommend you to visit it at night and see another Seoul in the light. It brings a new experience. The street is good for wandering and see the vehicles and other building around., October 2019
2,4.0,A nice walk over the city,"A pleasant walk over the the hustle of the city. Markets are sometimes held as at the weekend. It has a nice view of Seoul station, especially if you want to watch the sunset over the city.  Its also nicely lit after dark. Usually a few people walking about and taking photos, but never feels to busy.", September 2019
3,5.0,A Garden in the Air,"Like the New York Highline, this old roadway has been rebirthed as an above street garden walkway. As you proceed along, the vistas open out into a wide expansive view around Seoul station. If you’re lucky someone, maybe you, will be playing one of the several upright pianos stationed along the walkway. The gardens change as you walk through a range of plant species.", October 2019
4,4.0,Nice outdoor space in an otherwise very urban city ,It’s a bit like the NY Highline except more concrete. Nice way to get between areas of the city and avoid the traffic., October 2019
5,4.0,Seoulo highline,"A bit like the NY highline, this is an urban walkway created from a disused rail line that allows you to walk through the downtown area of Seoul unimpeded by traffic. What a simple but brilliant idea; I hope more cities copy it. There are pleasant features there (like a piano) to break the journey, it's a pleasant stroll you can pick up near Seoul station.", September 2019
6,5.0,An Airborne Oasis,"Take the walk at night.  The soft glow of the planters and occasional music along the way are good for the soul, an airborne oasis above the rush of cars and trains. During the days you may come across a player at one of the four or so pianos along the route.  And the blooms are changing every week. Even umbrellas are provided for an oppressive summer sun.  Thoughtful Korean designers at their best. Highly recommended.", July 2019
7,3.0,Overhead garden bridge,"It's an urban garden that's above the roads. You get a good view of Seoul Station (both old and new). If you're trainspotter, you can look at trains coming in and out of Seoul Station", July 2019
8,4.0,Great that Seoul followed Manhattan and converted this elevated highway section!,"The walkway is not very long but nice, with interesting trees and many pianos, plus a few interesting views.", July 2019
9,5.0,Wonderful little walk,"A quirky elevated garden built on an overpass above the busy Seoul streets. They provide free umbrellas to borrow whilst enjoying the walk and protect yourself from the sun. There are plenty of different varieties of plants, a nice area where mist is sprayed to keep cool (plants and tourists alike) and was overall a nice place to visit without crowds to bother you.", June 2019
10,4.0,"Whimsical, Botanical and No Traffic Lights","We were attracted by the lights at first, around midnight near our hotel in Seoul station. Taking those lighted stairs revealed at first a nice potted garden with each pot labeled with the latin botanical name for each plant. As we continued our walk, we found more than plants - it was a whimsical park, with working pianos, an embassy for an alien planet (where you can take official pictures behind the alien flag), trampolines, kids' drawing station, glass floors, and other rather amusing play areas - all free! Even late at night, the park felt safe - there are people walking through even after midnight. Also, the uniformed park keepers are still around late, with lighted red candlesticks in hand. This is an enjoyable place to walk, and it is most convenient when going from Seoul Station to Namdaemum or the Hoehyeon Station. Skip the traffic and take a walk in Seoullo - it will bring a smile to your heart!", June 2019
11,5.0,"Skip DDP, go here","It is probably the most beautiful walk to take in the night. The old Seoul Railway station is in lit up and so is the new one, not to mention the sky walkway. It is such a wonderful place to wander. Simply go!", June 2019
12,4.0,Nice Elevated Walkway,"This was an elevated walkway that was more than just glass, metal and concrete.  Everywhere planter boxes were filled with different types of trees, flowers and plants. All labeled in both Korean and Latin and some in bloom.  It made the walk more pleasant getting to Seoul Square especially not having to wait for crosswalk signals or traffic.A number of brightly colored pianos were randomly located and anyone could sit down and play a tune.  There also were some type of carts painted with animal characters that I  assumed could be used to wheel your kiddies around.The walkway was easily accessible through any number of stairs, elevators or ramps thus making it a convenient way of getting around the area.", May 2019
13,4.0,Our Mini Family Spring 2019,Seollal was my wishlist back in 2017 but only managed visit it this year.It was just infront of our 2nd homestay and at the back of Namdaemun gate 5.It was nice walking along the seollal with plants along with it and since it was cold during our visit we decided to have early lunch at the seolla building (dont remember the name) The building serve mostly for eateries.That time there was a marine exhibition being held., May 2019
14,4.0,Passing by sightseeing,Calling this an overhead bridge would be a severe understatement! There are tons of plants here with their scientific names and korean names. The view of the city at night wasnt so bad. There are pianos for ppl to use if they wish. The signages are all projected onto the floor which is quite cool. I went in the late evening though it seems like there are afew small activities for people to partake it for a small fee if theg wish but they were all closed when i went. Plenty of ambassadors and security walking around the area.Its lovely but i wouldnt go out of my way to visit it. Only if its nearby or along the way., May 2019
15,5.0,Great views and greenery in the bustling Seoul,"I just came back from Seoullo7017 - visited it on Sunday. I found it so calming and relaxing to walk around on this bridge high above the streets. It provides a leisurely walk connecting a few places. It is nicely decorated with pianos and plants adding a nice contrast to the streets around. I went during the day, but would love to come back in the evening to take some different shots. Worth a visit, for sure. Right by Seoul Station, so very easy to get to. There are stairs, as well as Ann escalator and elevators for those who with limited mobility or on wheelchairs.", April 2019
16,5.0,Fantastic view ,It’s a great opportunity to walk above the busy traffic and admire the city life in Seoul. No traffic lights at all., March 2019
17,3.0,Spring soon..,"all the plants are either leafless or covered because it still seems like winter here even though it's already end of March. but i did not regret coming here, we really can see the great effort to revitalise the city with fresh looks while letting visitors to experience the bustling city without to worry about the traffic.", March 2019
18,4.0,Offers A Different Perspective,"This wide, elevated walkway -- about 56-feet-high -- runs for 1 kilometer between Malli-dong and Namdaemun Market. The pedestrian green space opened in 2017, replacing a highway overpass that originated in 1970. I've strolled along the two similar walkways that exist worldwide, the High Line in New York City and the Promenade Plantee in Paris, and was curious about how this one would compare. So on a recent visit to Seoul, I picked up a brochure about the attraction at the Information office, about where Seoullo 7017 begins by the market's Gate 5. Here, the walkway is like a ramp, slowly rising to the full height.  Along the stretch, I also noted five elevators and one escalator.I liked the opportunity to amble with few pedestrians to dodge, looking at buildings and vehicular traffic from a different perspective than what occurs at ground level. Cafes and at least one place to buy snacks beckoned on this early Sunday morning, and myriad plants thrived in a variety of pots along with young trees. The brochure offered an introduction to the greenery that can be seen here, but the growth still has a way to go to compete with New York City and Paris. There is also much more concrete here and the distance is shorter than the other two.It took about 15 minutes to walk to an elevator that descends to Seoul Station Square. But it does not lead directly into the station.Seoullo 7017 appealed to me for a one-time visit. But it did not entice me to return, which happened with the High Line and Promenade Plantee.", November 2018
19,4.0,Calmness over the hectic korean lifestyle,"Well, personally I liked this place although many people said this place is not as good as they thought. Just my timing was not good. I visited this place during the Winter over a bad pollution.Surrounded by high buildings,I could imagine visiting this walkpath during the sunset on the Spring with a good weather should become a great view. I can feel the calmness over the hectic korean lifestyle", November 2018
20,4.0,Innovation the Seoul way,"Great innovation and urban revitalisation. Use it to walk quickly from Seoul Station to Namdaemun. Along the way, lots for the eye to see, including those cute tortoises that tricked me into thinking they were statues. Really quirky and one of those reasons, Seoul just keeps on giving as a growing exciting destination.", October 2018
21,5.0,Beautiful at night time,Not too long of a walk but very enjoyable! I love the setup especially the variety of trees and plants. Pack an umbrella in case it rains., October 2018
22,4.0,Pleasant place,Walked along seoullo from seoul station to Namdaemun market. Pleasant walk on seoullo looking at buildings and there’s even coffee shop along seoullo. Nice place to take a walk and enjoy seoul. Elevators are available for strollers and wheelchair, October 2018
23,4.0,Pretty walk near sunset ,"We decided to visit this park around sunset: various plantings and street pianos are scattered about, plus some tiny coffee shops and some stores. It’s about .5-6 mile ?, inspired by what NYC did in the Highline Park, which we happened to see 4 months ago.", October 2018
24,3.0,Shorter than I expected,"Seoullo 7017 was quite nice once you get up. There's an elevator or you can wind your way up the stairs and get some exercise. There's not much to see except the rail and buildings but it's a nice way to cross the road and offers a great place to sit along with all the trees and ponds up here. There's quite an evident homeless scene underneath as many older Koreans sit by Seoul station but they won't bother you. While here, walk to Lotte Mart which is nearby for an interesting experience in a Korean supermarket.", September 2018
25,2.0,Honestly not worth it,"It’s a knock off attempt at the high line, except there is no design philosophy whatsoever. No effort made to make the motifs work with each other. Just ugly cement pots with flowers on a bridge", September 2018
26,4.0,OLD ELEVATED ROAD CONVERTED INTO A PEDESTRIAN WALK WAY,"It was around 1970 when this elevated road was constructed to connect two sides around Seoul Station. However due to safety issues, the road was closed.After this, rather than tearing down the existing structure, the road was developed into Seoullo 7017, an elevated garden for pedestrians.I visited last April and May during spring time and the trees were in their prime conditions. The walk way is like the condensed version of the Korean forest and flora.I recommend to schedule a visit at around 5 pm until sundown as the views are amazing with the changing sky colors and the sun rays are not too harsh on these times.There is a convenience store in the middle part of the walk way with a viewing deck at the top for better views.", April 2018
27,5.0,Lovely at christmas,"i was living in Namdaemun so every time i would take the subway or need to do laundry i would have to cross Seoullo and it was always lovely at Christmas they decorate the park and little activity areas, there is also a cafe and lift down to exit 8 of Seoul station", November 2017
28,5.0,Great walk,"We discovered this by accident one evening when we decided to walk from Namdaemun market to Seoul station. The flowers are great and when lit up at night with the soft breeze, it is a fantastic walk with views over parts of the city.", August 2018
29,4.0,Quite nice but short,"This is a welcome walk that now allows to leisurely cross the busy station square. This elevated « green » walk is actually not that green despite the numerous plants that have been planted in concrete structures, but still much much better than anything grey and polluted below. Its was probably difficult to do much better in such environment. It is also a  good opportunity to review your botanical skills as all plants there have a label (in Korean but with Latin names). The most disappointing is the length of this walk, maybe 1 km or so, meaning that you cross it in 15 minutes.", August 2018
30,4.0,"For a different view of Seoul, visit the Seoullo 7017 'skyline'","Recently opened and featuring all manner of interactive elements in addition to great views of this ever-changing city, Seoullo 7017 is an easy journey on-foot through green spaces that have been built on an old freeway ramp. Leading the visitor from nearby the Namdaemun Market to Seoul Station (or vice-versa), the best time to visit is dusk as the park is lit-up by coloured LEDs, entire building sides are illuminated by animated video displays and the city is bathed in a golden light as the sun sets. Seoul Station offers a small number of eateries as well as discount shopping, but anticipate some homeless people waiting out the day in its shadow.", July 2018
31,5.0,The best part of Seoul!,"A must do! A long walk bridge, so uniquely done. Lovely plantations all along, colourful flowers! Steps and elevators at short distances for you to get off at various locations along the way. Equally stunning at night. Good promenade!", May 2018
32,5.0,Great for a break,"You can sign up for a free guided walking tour 3 days in advance through the official Visit Seoul website, but i found that it's perfectly satisfactory just walking and relaxing. The view is also pretty nice, you can see the moving traffic and buildings in the distance from above. There are multiple beautifully painted pianos which you can play on. All the plants have name tags including the korean and the scientific name. They are in alphabetical order and provide QR codes to access information about them.", July 2018
33,4.0,Excellent place for a pause,Go here for a relaxing walk in the city. Green and no cars. Some spots with nice view. We had a coffee break between shopping and sightseeing., November 2017
34,5.0,"Fun, romantic, nice-looking, and clean","It’s a new highline with a nice skyline of the city, with free high-quality pianos standing around, cold water pool to cool your feet, and lots of flowers and trees. It’s well-designed and can be a romantic spot, but also perfect for families and friends. Definitely worth checking out!", July 2018
35,4.0,Atmospheric at night,"When I was in Seoul last year, Seoullo was not yet open to the public. So I went to check it out this time. I went in the late evening on a weekday.  There were few visitors.  The elevated walkway was lit up in blue LED light and was atmospheric. You could get a good view of Seoul Station, the flashing animated light designs on a building in front of the station, and the busy traffic on the thoroughfares down below.  Outside one of the pavilions, there are display panels with a time lapse video on the development of the walkway (project designed by the Dutch team MVRDV).Would go again next time in Seoul during the day to enjoy the space.", June 2018
36,5.0,An amazing experience on top of the chaos,"Visiting this space above the chaos that surrounds Seoul Station is pure magic: the nature taking over the city and the way this walk to the market and the station has been created is the perfect spot to visit, not only for architects or architecture lovers, but also to appreciate Seoul in a different way.", September 2017
37,4.0,Relaxing walkway,"This is a.new tourist attraction in the center of Seoul.  It used to be an overpass for the motorists but the city govt converted it to a.new pedestrian overpass.Seoullo17 stretches from namdaemun market in hoehyon station up to Malla-dong.  I started my walk in the hoehyon side where the tourist information was located.  Since it used to be a bridge, the walk uphill was a.breeze.  This overpass.was connected to 2 buildings.where the cafes and restaurants including the comfort rooms.are located.  At the center of the overpass, you will have a commanding view of seoul station and the sorrounding areas.  The place has alot of benches, and plant boxes.  Since it was early spring, the plants have not bloomed yet, in fact they are just starting to.plant flowering plants.This overpass had several exits with elevators.  One can easily go to seoul station and the seoul bus transport center.This place is good for walking during spring and autumn but i.doubt during summer and rainy season.", April 2018
38,5.0,Very relaxing walk,I came here during the evening and was able to see the scenery at day and at night as well. This is a favourite spot for both locals and tourists as you are surrounded by well-maintained plants and on top of bustling roads that crosses Seoul Station as well. Will come here again!, April 2018
39,4.0,Seoullo - an elevated pedestrian walkway from Seoul station to Namdemun market.,"A newly renovated old viaduct for vehicles turned into a pedestrian walkway. It was completed n opened in July 2017.The former vehicle viaduct was deemed unsafe n too expensive to repair for vehicle use. It was converted to a pedestrian walkway. It begins at Seoul station opposite the Lotte Mart n ends at Namdemun Market gate 6.It is illuminated in blue led lights from 7.15pm onwards. Quite a sight to enjoy. Very convenient to walk with escalators and elevators at various points. Cafes, tourist info center n patrolling security personnel are on hand to to provide you with assistance.A must place to visit n enjoy.", April 2018
40,5.0,Seoullo 7017 Garden is Serenity in the City,"Seoullo 7017 Sky Garden is the latest landmark that has been added to the bevy of attractive tourists’ sites in Seoul City. I visited a couple of months after it's opening in 2017 and it was as serene as I could imagine.The plants and flowers were green and offered a space to relax, especially if you want to read or sip on your coffee. The views on the highways under the Sky Walkway is also amazing. There are souvenir shops and coffee shops lined on the monument. It is also easier to reach Namdaemun market and Namsan Park. The night views with all the lights are enchanting.", August 2017
41,3.0,A Unique Place in Seoul.,"Seoul 7017 is an old highway that has been converted into a walking bridge with lots of attractions and nature. Right next to Seoul Station, Seoullo 7017 is very central and provides a nice break from the constant city on all sides. However, I think that you probably can't spend more than an hour or two here.", December 2017
42,3.0,ok but overpriced,"Good idea, kinda ok execution, the plants are pretty, but it's way too short and the f&b facilities are overpriced. Just go eat at Namdaemun market if you go there!", March 2018
43,4.0,Amazing Bridge!!!,It's a very beautiful attraction place in Seoul because so many flowers and trees along the walk away. It was very relaxing to walk in this place. This place will be nice to shoot buildings and railways in Seoul, April 2017
44,4.0,take a stroll,as you can see from other reviews this attraction will not amaze you. It's the place for those that like to walk and take in the view. If you are in the mood for a  stroll it offers a nice view of  downtown Seoul and if the weather is nice can be a good spot to enjoy the sunset. We walked from the Seoul Station down to Namdaemun market., March 2018
45,2.0,Overhead Bridge,"If your country have a overhead bridge, then no point visiting this place. It is simply a decorated overhead bridge with top down city views", March 2018
46,4.0,I was there sun setting,I was in Seoul in Dec and it was very cold. I walked on the bridge Seoullo 7017 from Seoul Station. Sun was setting., December 2017
47,4.0,A Showcase of Korean Urban Regeneration,"Seoullo 7017 used to be an elevated flyover near the Seoul Train Station before it was converted into a pedestrian sky garden in 2017. Visited in mid-January when the temperature plunged to a few degrees Celsius. We were there for a walk after our dinner. It was very relaxing to walk in the park. We were there during Winter, thus there were no plants or trees along the sky garden but it could be seen what supposed to be areas where trees and plants will grow during other seasons of the year.There was a Light Festival during Winter to compensate the lack of plants, I suppose. The Light Festival was beautiful showing pieces of lights art. The pedestrian bridge also offer a nice view of the surrounding bustling urban area.Would recommend if you like to enjoy urban parks and appreciate urban infrastructure/buildings, generally urbanisation.", January 2018
48,4.0,Pedestrian bridge,"We're visiting Seoullo on our winter trip and we loved the view from the top. By walking through Seoul Station exit 2, we reached this new landmark. It was near the old building of Seoul Station. It was very windy and the temperature was about - 13 celcius, but still we enjoyed to be there.  If you like to walk along, there are three routes that you can choose. Along this bridge, there are some cafés and information center.", January 2018
49,3.0,New landmark ,"When Seoullo is all lit up in blue, it looks magical. Since it is facing west and high up, it can also be a good spot for sunset photo.  I was there last August when the walkway was newly opened. The city offered free walking tour in the evening. It was interesting. From Seoullo, we walked to Namsan Park and down to Namdaemun. The whole tour was about 1.5 - 2 hours.", August 2017
50,4.0,Nice Pedestrian Bridge to Walk Along,"It's a very new attraction place in Seoul. There are many trees & flowers along the walk way. you can start it around Namdaemun Market or Seoul Station. There are some connecting paths to the major buildings. If you would like to visit in the morning, please come around 07:30 or 08:00 am. If you come later, it's very hot. But if you would like to find sme coffee/ snacks/ food to eat, the shops there will open around 10:30 - 11:00 am. For me, I love to visit at night time (after 19:30 pm.)  to see some beautiful lights.", April 2017
51,3.0,Another Linkway,"I was looking forward to this, to see the hype that surrounded this. To my dismay, it is like another linkway above the busy roads of Seoul Station. I guess it would be best to see during Spring where the trees and flowers are in full bloom. The stems of plants are bare as its winter now. What i do like is that there are speakers with sounds of nature being fed in.", November 2017
52,4.0, A pedestrian bridge with a view,"This is a alleviated pedestrian bridge with broad walkway and benches. Beside linking the shopping Mall and the popular Lotte Outlets and Lotte Mart to Seoul Station, this bridge gives a good overview of the roads and surrounding buildings. My family chances upon this pedestrian bridge and was impressed with the place. At that time the sun was just setting and we could have a beautiful sight of the setting sun.", November 2017
53,5.0,New attraction,"If you want to see Seoul at night, you can visit this place.Theres a walking tour you can avail for free.", October 2017
54,3.0,"Pretty empty, better to visit at night","Seoullo 2017 is directly connected to Seoul Station. There wasn't much stuff to see in the day, so I'd recommend to visit at night when the walkway is lit up.", October 2017
55,5.0,Fun experience,"Rather like the Highline in New York City, this is a derelict flyover that's been converted into a modern, fun place to stroll above the city traffic. Lots of places to sit and people watch, amongst the trees, lotus ponds, shrubs and look out points. Free to wander and well worth the climb.", October 2017
56,3.0,Casual stroll for a cool night,Best done with a tour guide that you can book for free on iTour Seoul website.  The guide will give you a background as to how the pedestrian walk came about and lead you through a pleasant walk around the area.  The blue lights are nice to be caption camera.  If you're into horticulture you'll also find various plants along the way.  My highlight of the evening was chatting with our guide., October 2017
57,4.0,Better in the evening,"Nice skywalk near Seoul Station. Very rare walk-through in Seoul. The view around is also cool.- There's an illumination in the evening. So, it's better to go late if you wish to feel romantic. During summer, it's too hot during the daytime.- There are various plants with names on them. Not that interesting, though. Good for kids' studies. I think family with children will have more fun with a few attractions.- Unfortunately, souvenir shops aren't selling rare stuffs. Few people are interested.- There's an elevator on downhill to the Namdaemun Gate. N Seoul Tower-Baekbeom Park-Seoullo 7017-Seoul Station route by walk is recommended.", September 2017
58,3.0,Seoullo 7017 Review,"It is an interesting and creative idea to develop a pedestrian like this. But, in my opinion, around Seoullo 7017 needs to be developed both for visitors of the city and the citizens.", October 2017
59,4.0,Nice city walk ,"Gives you a good look and feel of the city, while still being perfectly safe.  It's a disused road that's turned into an urban walkway.  Nice nature and peaceful to sit. Extends from myeongdong to seoul station", October 2017
60,5.0,Great place for a beautiful photo spot,Love this place so much. I started my walk from the Seoul Station (exit at the Airport Rail). Really loved the views from the walkway at night. Don't forget to also detour right after the Seoullo Terrace (towards the Hilton and Seven Lucky Casino) and you will be at the part of the city wall. Very beautiful location from up there. You can see the Namsan Tower and skyline.Really recommended., September 2017
61,4.0,Beautiful walk at night,"On a nice night, the walk from one end to the other is fabulous. We had a hard time finding the entrance in the dark, but it was worth it. It was beautifully lit and we very much enjoyed the views of the city at night.", August 2017
62,4.0,Nice place to refreshen you up,Went today with my brother. Nice refreshing place. Spent some time there. Wish for more places like this. Enjoyed the stroll and talk there amidst the pace of this city., September 2017
63,5.0,A wonderful experience,"We love the idea of how Seoullo 7017 was revived! The flora presentation was nice. Our girls were delighted to see and hear so many cicadas and dragonflies flying around. We enjoyed our tea break at the little cafe (love their sandwiches) and towards the end of our stroll, we were serenaded by the music performers (near Seoullo Terrace). Very well maintained and clean!", August 2017
64,5.0,Walk,This is a wonderful Sky Walk. We wish there was one like this in every city around the world. It puts pedestrians first. We arrived in Seoul Station 3 days ago in the evening with heavy luggage and thought we would have to battle our way across roads and traffic. Imagine our surprise when we looked up and saw this wonderful Sky Walk which took us straight to hour Hotel Maru. We took it!We have had several walks since and love the flowers and trees which are all well looked after and growing excellently. We enjoyed the foot bath and the cafes and views. Highly recommend this as such a futuristic way to manage pedestrians. We come from the UK and wish London could have something like this., August 2017
65,4.0,Almost like highline park in New York,"This park is situated on a bridge, just like highline park in New York. There was a pool where you could take a footbath, very nice when you have walked for an entire day. They also had small cafes where you could buy ice cream. Its not a park where you stay for hours but its nice to visit if you are in the neighbourhood.", July 2017
66,4.0,New place to visit in Seoul,"It was an overpass in front of Seoul station and had been transformed to a walkway for pedestrian. Easily accessed from Namdaemun market, Hoehyeon station, Seoul Station metro, the path crossed over busy streets of Seoul with hundreds kind of plants along the way. Some shops was opened too. But as in its early stage, some parts were still in repair/renovation. In overall, it was a nice short trip there.", July 2017
67,4.0,Morning Stroll at Seoullo 7017,"From our first stop which is the Seoullo Information Center up to the Seoullo Shop all the staff are very friendly and has a sunny disposition. At first Seoullo 7017 may just look like a bridge adorned with a variety of flowers and plants, but as you go about the tour you discover that it has a lot to offer. It has halls that caters to various activities such as art exhibits. It has food shops to cater to your hungry tummy like Magnolia Cafe, Rose Bingsu and Hydrangea Bread (the lemon iced tea is so refreshing). Bibimbap at 7017 Seoul Bibimbap is delicious and just like the typical Korean serving,  it is big for our small tummies. :)  We had a hard time choosing a souvenir item at the Seoullo Shop because of the many choices - pens, shirt, tote bag, mug, etc. It is recommended that you go here on an early morning or late afternoon to evening as it is too hot during our visit.", July 2017
68,3.0,My third time here ,"I have waited many years for this park to open: I like it in because its a place to get away from the noise and it allows some good views and a place to walk around for people in the area. Its creatively made and interesting but try not to visit between 12-1pm because that is lunch break. The reason for only 3 stars is the dying plants and the lack of people taking care of them. I went to the office to mention it, but obviously they did not care much as it was easy to see the little interest they had in doing something about it 😩 This has the potential to be realllyyy good or end in an ugly failure after a few years. Bring in paintings on the cement walls and color it using beautiful colors and it would be a much better place and more enjoyable.", June 2017
69,4.0,Small is beautiful,"I especially like the different kind of roses exposed, it is quite small but it is beautiful. You can enjoy a nice walk there.", May 2017
70,5.0,It is worth walking at the time of sunset,The view of the Seoul station on the bridge was really beutiful when the sun set. I strongly recommend to walk from Namdaemun toward Seoul station in evening., June 2017
71,5.0,A newly opened walkway,"The walkway was just opened for two weeks, but it is so relaxed walking on the ex-car way. You can take the beautiful photo of the busy traffic from the bridge as well as be watching the trains getting in and out the Seoul station. more than 20000 plants are on the road but they are mostly newly planted so it may take a few years for them to grow. There are several shops and information center on the bridge and the staff wearing a green striped shirt. They are very helpful and some of them could speak several languages as the are international students studying in Seoul. The walkway is quite windy some time but also hot at noon. Some water facilities and restaurants are installed so you can cool down and take some rest. It is a good connection between the Seoul Station and the area of Myongdong.", May 2017
72,1.0,Terrible,Went on the grand opening. Crazy busy. All the plants were dying. Expected it to be like the High Line. Don't waste your time, May 2017
73,4.0,"22,000 trees in large flower pots on an old highway flyover in the heart of the city","I have not been there after the opening but I am the lighting designer of Seoullo 7017 so I thought I upload a couple images here. Seoullo 7017 is not a park, it is a ""village of trees"". It has over 20,000 trees and plants that grow in large flower pots arranged on the deck of a flyover (once a motorway). It is now a large pedestrian space, there is information about the trees, some kiosks etc. but mostly it is a spectacular walk elevated above the city. At night, Seoullo 7017 transforms into a ""deep blue galaxy of trees"" thanks to thousands of LED lights that create a unique atmosphere.Seoullo 7017 is open 24/7 and free of charge. Just go, walk and enjoy!", May 2017
74,5.0,Nice spot for photo grapher,If you are photographer. This place will be nice to shoot buildings and railways in Seoul. It is also nice to after the Namdaemoon shopping traditional market., May 2017
75,2.0,Artificial park in the middle of traffic jam and surounded with car polution,"2017 May 20, Saturday was the first opening day, and I had chance to visit here. They planted trees and herbs in a cement/concrete flower pot. I wonder if it is park, the greenish park with several trees and flowers on the cement road! It was opening day but already some of small trees are dried and were going to die... brownish and yellowish leaves on them. Only one thing I can see as a good, you have quite nice views towards Seoul train station and Namdaemun gate. It was horrible the traffice jam under this ""artificial park""", May 2017
