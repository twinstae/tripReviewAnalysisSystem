You can rent those nearby and I read with them, the entrance to palaces is free (this palace is 3000won). Lots of good photo opportunities and especially away from the main palace it was nicer to walk around, less people. Try to see the changing of the guards! It's outside the palace so free.

56,5.0,Well worth it ,"Make sure you take in the changing of the guard, we did the 1030hrs. Also do not miss visiting the museums, both are well worth it; best to set aside most of the day to do the museums justice.", December 2019
57,5.0,Impressive ,My husband and I walked here from Insa-Dong area. The Insa-Dong visitors center was very helpful and provided us a map to the palace. This place was very cool. Cost $6 usd which is very reasonable. There were lots of visitors but it wasn’t so crowded that it made the visit unenjoyable. The museum on the premises is very helpful with providing more information about the palace that isn’t explained on the grounds., December 2019
58,5.0,Beautiful palace,"Very beautiful and historic. Take the time to understand some of the history and try to put yourself in that time.

67,5.0,Essential Korean Pageantry & Color,"An essential part of any visit to Seoul.  Unsurprisingly, the palace is a smaller version of the Forbidden City in Beijing.  If you are wearing traditional Korean costume (hanbok) you get in for free, so when we were there about a third of the visitors were wearing traditional Korean garb, which gave the whole experience the feel of being at a masquerade.  Do  not miss the changing of the guard at 10:00 AM.  There is an adequate English tour at 11:00, at no extra change.", November 2019

Weather was pleasantly cool in November, and the autumn leaves are stunning", November 2019

73,4.0,An insight into the historic past,, December 2019
74,5.0,Good photo shoot for Hanbok,The place is quite big but not as big as Forbidden city. But the place is spacious for foto shoots. Better wear themed Hanbok for contrast on the building color. Use the Discover Seoul Pass for your hanbook it’s a wise choice., December 2019
75,5.0,The Change of Guard was entertaining,"We eventually found this place - got mixed up with other Palaces.  We watched the Change of Guard and got some pictures before they moved off then did the English tour (free).

76,4.0,More for the atmosphere than the authenticity,"Meticulously reconstructed in the heart of Seoul, this visually impressive site is worth a visit for the crowds of Koreans (and some Chinese) walking around in Korean traditional costumes and for the contrast with the skyscrapers in the background.

79,3.0,Crowded place even in winter,"We were lucky to visit this place on a sunny winter day.  Surprisingly, the place is crowded with tourists and it was a challenge to take pictures in the Korean traditional costume.  If one wears the traditional costume, then one can enter the palace for free and there are a lot of lovely spots for photo sessions.", December 2019
80,5.0,Be transported back in time!,"Amidst the hustle and bustle of the city outside, the palace remained serene and one felt like being transported back in time as it has retained its beauty of long ago.

The changing of the guard is an interesting ceremony to watch.", October 2019
85,5.0,Nice place to sightseeing,, December 2019
86,4.0,They should charge more.,"This is a large expansive complex that really requires at least three hours to experience.  And with the ridiculously cheap admission rates, you will definitely get your money's worth.  A lot of people (locals and tourists alike) enjoy renting traditional Korean clothes (hanbuk) and often mill around throughout.  Photos are accepted; just politely ask first.  It really is a 5 star attraction; I am just not into this type of thing and would rather spend my time in a local neighbourhood hanging out which is why I gave it 4 stars.", November 2019
87,5.0,Beautiful place,, November 2019

We went here during Fall season and it's magical we were surrounded by trees of red, yellow and orange. The wind blowing adds to the beauty of the falling leaves. Despite the plenty of tourists we have space to take beautiful photos and videos. There are even Korean cultural dance shows with photo opts afterwards. Behind this massive complex stands the mighty Mt. Baegaksan (a 342 m high granite mountain) a perfect background for your beautiful photos and videos. Some tourists rent traditional Hanbok dress, a traditional Korean clothes. Rental prices vary depending on the time starting at around 13K to 15K Won for about 4 hrs.

Such good timing especially as the ceremony took less than ten minutes.  Every 4th Wednesday is a special day and it is free to go in. There were lots of people in National dress looking very fine all glittering hooped skirts for the ladies and over large tall hats for the men. If you wear National Dress on any day it is also free to go in. The ground was very uneven and may be tricky for elderly to walk on. The grounds are massive, there was so much to see. It was originally built in 1395 and  served as the home of Kings of the Joseon dynasty, and been extensively restored after various conflicts all but destroyed it.  Well worth a visit.

At certain times, there are free guide tours in english", October 2019
167,4.0,A nice place,It’s an impressive place so I recommend at least walking through it.

171,4.0,Visit the farthest area from the entrance.,"The palace is packed with tourists. We instead went to the farthest area north of the front gate where it was too far for tourists to go to. The view of the mountain was stunning. You can also imagine yourself walking as a resident of the palace hundreds of years ago. Oriental magpies and Brown-eared bulbuls make the palace come alive, not to mention the autumn foliage blazing in the background. You're going to have a great experience of the attraction where there are less people, in my opinion.", October 2019

178,5.0,Huge! Packed with history! ,"The tour of the Palace took us 4 hours! Unless you're running through it, you cannot do it faster (OK maybe 3-3,5h is possible too). We went there for the 11 o'clock gate guard change (a shorter ceremony) and finished it with the 2 p.m. General guard change ceremony. Both are for free and can be enjoyed even if you don't go to see the Palace. The entrance fee is ridiculously low, so you will definitely get more than you're paying for. We also got the audio guide as it provides detailed information about different buildings and the history. It's available in English, Korean and Chinese. It's not a must as you can read the signs to get some information but we felt like having an audio guide is easier as you can listen it while exploring. What we absolutely loved and recommend is the hidden café- Saenggwabang, the Dessert Department! It's located in the Palace kitchen buildings, so you need to look for it as otherwise you will probably not just stumble on it. We went there around joon, which is the perfect timing as later most of cakes were already sold out. You can purchase the traditional cakes as well as herbal tea and enjoy it in their lovely little café, on the floor. We absolutely loved the experience! I believe we paid like 9000won,which is ~7€, for a pot of tea and 4 cakes. We really wanted to buy some to go but that's unfortunately not possible, which is actually understandable as they want to keep it a unique experience.", October 2019
179,4.0,History check,Palace that has interesting history. Most of the original palace buildings have been destroyed. Few have been preserved and some rebuilt.

If you could only see one palace this is the one.", October 2019
184,4.0,Worth the Visit,"This is a huge complex, made up of several sections. If you are going to visit don't make any other plans for the morning. Get there early, before the tour groups and school classes on field trips. The folk museum in particular gets over run by crowds after 11:00. The architecture is beautiful and the location in the heart of the city makes it easy to access. A definite must see in Seoul.

198,5.0,Excellent palace,We ended up renting hanbok (Korean old-style fancy clothing) before going into the palace which meant that we got free entry.
