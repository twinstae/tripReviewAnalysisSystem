There are eateries open till late, and this is the mid-point between Hongdae and Edae which are easily accesible by walking. If you look close enough, there is good food to be found at student prices! A good mix of fast food, restaurants, street food and cafes. Some cafes offer a 50% discount if you take-out your americano/espresso/other beverages. This place is brimming with stylish students due to it's strategic location near a few universities. There is a department store at the main junction for those who prefer their branded goods, and also some established retail brands in the vicinity. I love that this place opens till late, so it's easy to grab a bite on the way back to your accomodation, regardless of the time.
