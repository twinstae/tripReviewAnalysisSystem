0,4.0,Ancient village,This area is so beautiful. Perfect for taking loads of pictures while wearing hanbok. The only thing is you need to keep quiet and do not make loud noice as there are people still living in it. Please respect the locals., October 2019
1,4.0,For the Gram,"Perfect for photo spots as the place looks really pretty and nostalgic. Would be great if you could wear a hanbok here just for this purpose. Some slopes to climb but managable even for the elderly. It's an actual residential neighbourhood, so mind your noise and manners. There are shops, tea-houses and cafes that you can pop into. There are walking tours available but those need to be reserved online.", October 2019
2,3.0,Nostalgic,The houses are very nice. Nice place to take a stroll although a bit tiring. It would be nice to go there wearing Hanbok if you love taking pictures. Try not to make much noise because there are people residing in the area., April 2019
3,4.0,Good and quiet ancient village ,Around half an hour walk from the major Palace. Its literally a private residence area. Quiet and the buildings are ancient built. Nice to tour but be careful it is a bit maze puzzle. You could easily enter into the village but not sure where and how to get out haha., February 2020
4,4.0,Good wandering neighborhood,"I first got so lost trying to find a certain restaurant (turns out it was closed), but once you let go and just wander wherever you want, you'll be fine.

5,3.0,Quiet place. For the nostalgic only.,"A stone throw away from Changdeokgung Palace. Thus if one is nearby the vincinity, then perhaps might as well pop by for a look. Nothing much though except for some traditional looking houses and if short on time, its perfectly fine to give it a miss. Do keep the volume down as there are residents there.", February 2020
6,3.0,What village?,Not sure this place ought to be on the map of places to visit. Followed the walk proposed and did see some old houses and lots of old roofs but when you looked carefully the walls of the ‘old’ houses proved it is brand new houses most of them., February 2020
7,4.0,Truly authentic Korean,, October 2019
8,3.0,Good to take pictures,"It's a small neighborhood with traditional Korean houses. A good place to take pictures if you're wearing the hanbok. If you do not have much time to spare in Seoul, I would suggest you head somewhere else.", November 2019

13,5.0,Walk back in time,This is one of the best area's to stroll through while getting a feel of the old city.

20,5.0,Bukchon Hanok Village,"I don't believe that this is a hidden secret spot in Seoul anymore.  This beautiful gem of a village was teeming with tourists when I was there.  So many people dressed up in traditional costumes to enjoy photo ops utilizing the back drop of historical Korean houses.  There are so many people here that local grannies have their own volunteer patrol with signs to instruct the general public to keep the noise level down.  Despite being crowded, this is such a wonderful area to explore, albeit quite hilly but scenic and definitely great photo ops.  You can spend some time just wandering the roadway and alleys, discovering, cafes, craft shops and art galleries nestled amongst the traditional style hanoks.  Definitely one of my favorite areas in Seoul.", November 2019
21,5.0,Centuries Of History ,"Just about 1 mile north (I think) of Insadong, sits a village you think whose time has passed. You would be wrong. The Village is a mix of shop owners, home owners & people who dress in period costumes while strolling through the quiet streets.", January 2020

24,5.0,Interesting preview into the past,Visited this place on a cold Saturday. Went up to the youth cultural corps and they provided high school students to help guide you along the place. The two student guides were super informative and helped provided so much info and thus such meaning to the place.

28,4.0,Uniquely Seoul,"Bukchon Hanok Village is the largest cluster of Korean hanok homes in Seoul.  When wandering through this neighborhood, it’s fascinating to think that people actually live there.  The neighborhood has a charm all its own that is unique to Seoul.  It’s a nice walk that can take all day, depending on how quickly one progresses through the picturesque streets.  The main arteries have hanoks that have been converted for commercial uses so aside from the architectural wonders, there is a lot of retail shopping to be done while taking breaks in between for great meals and coffee breaks.  Additionally, the views are worth the walk, as parts of the walk are hilly and so great views of Seoul pop up along the way.", April 2019
29,4.0,Modernity and tradion can co exist,A fine example that modernity does not have to obliterate the old world. Of note are the hanoks which have been taken over by the city govt to preserve and be used as mini-museums., December 2019

Both volunteers were passionate about sharing the Korean history and culture with the group and I had a good time. They initially refused my tips but I insisted.

37,5.0,The Best Red Bean Pankakes Ever! ,"This small, quaint village was a lively place to visit. It presented a lot of traditional housing and Korean day-to-day lifestyle. Although it was a bit of a hike, the people were lovely and were confidently showing us their various artworks, handmade clothes and so on. The architecture was sensational and having a Red Bean Pankake is a must-do! I would advise being cautious when bringing young children or large groups as it could disturb others and they have posters almost everywhere about remaining quiet. The village itself links into the main town which is also advisable to visit, and is nearby to other attractions.", December 2019
38,5.0,Interesting area of Seoul,"I love this area of Seoul mainly for the traditional homes mixed with the cafes, small shops, and various art  galleries.

48,3.0,Conflicted,, December 2019
49,3.0,A quiet walk,This is a beautiful old area of Seoul. It is very steep to walk so be prepared.The reason for my average rating is the fact that this is a residential area with signs everywhere asking you to be quiet! Very difficult if you are with someone and are trying to converse about the buildings.Many of these have signs requesting no photos so it means you are just walking up and down the streets. It is also VERY crowded., October 2019

55,5.0,Traditional Korean houses ,"This is a residential area with hundreds of traditional Korean houses called hanoks. The area is open to visitors between 9 am and 5 pm. There are a number of alleys in the village through which you can take a walk. Though there are sign posts requesting tourists to keep their voices down so as to not disturb the residents, we found many tourists disregarding this. There are guards in the alleys who also keep making this request. There are lot of boutiques, souvenir shops and food stalls in the village. The walk was a very pleasant one and the architecture was unique. It felt like being a part of their homes and culture. A must do if you are in Seoul", April 2019

58,4.0,Good experience ,The Hanok village is conveniently located near the Gyeongongbuk Palace and its definitely worth visiting after leaving the palace.

There’s and easy map with a route to follow for beautiful views of the traditional rooftops and the hills surrounding Seoul.  Gorgeous in November with changing leaves.

78,5.0,Just go through the hanok village,Although I did not stay very long at this place I really enjoyed going there.  I like the contrast of these old Korean traditional houses with the Seoul building.  if you are looking good you can find cute little cafe and have quieter places where everyone gathered to make pictures in hanbok.  I recommend this place by staying there for several hours does not really interest.  thought to also respect the tranquility of the inhabitants (the houses are not empty but well inhabited)., November 2019
79,3.0,Good introduction to 'old' Seoul,Bukchon is a nice place to have a leisurely walk along narrow streets and old buildings where you can catch glimpses into hanok courtyards and there are plenty of places to stop off for a drink or a spot of shopping. The only annoyance is the hundreds of young Koreans in hanbok (traditional dress) constantly taking photos of each other so you have to endlessly stop and wait for them to finish., September 2019
80,1.0,For Instagram only,Cringy tourists taking ridiculous photos here for their Instagram. Don’t waste your time here. More historic views/buildings elsewhere., November 2019

84,3.0,Very much over rated area,"If you don't intend to do anything except shop in Seoul you might find the area interesting. It mainly consists of narrow lane ways edged with new and some older style houses, it is somewhat lacking in authenticity. You will mainly see roofs but the occasional house is visible. Many houses are now coffee shops or boutiques. When travelling around Seoul, if you keep your eyes open you will see much more genuine examples of older style Korean houses. This is the most disappointing Korean attraction I have come across. Perhaps it is worth a look if you are visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace as it is close by. See it first because after the palace it would be rubbish. South Korea has some amazing sights, but this isn't one of them.", October 2019
85,5.0,Very interesting ,"Beautiful traditional Korean houses lined up this village, which is free entrance. Touring this Village, one has to be silent as these are residences and they don’t want to be disturbed understandably.", November 2019

90,4.0,New Money Rebuilding Old Houses,"This hillside district is an interesting place to walk, but the people who live here for it’s charm put up unwelcoming signs and have people stationed around the neighbourhood with signs saying “shhh”. That said, the houses are beautiful (on the outside) and well worth a look. The streets are narrow and can be dangerous for pedestrians. The area is also quite popular with tourists, so expect a crowd. Visiting people do dress in traditional costumes, so there are lots of photo opportunities. Not all welcome the attention.", October 2019

107,4.0,Nice,Had a nice walk here. Full of shops and tea houses. Some sold traditional handcrafted items. Would recommend it., September 2019
108,3.0,Crowded but interesting.,This is a residential neighborhood of very old homes.  The houses are not open to the public but the streets (many very steep streets) are interesting to roam about (quietly because people actually live here).  Great for photographers.  Many visitors rent Hanbok costumes and pose for photos.  Lots of little shops and places to eat along the way.  Streets can be crowded on weekends., September 2019
109,3.0,Beautiful from a distant ,"as this is still an actual residential area the inside of the house can’t be seen, but it is the interior + exteriors that makes the Hanok ever interesting ... fine other hanok villages that allow you to have a meal in it I.e onion cafe", September 2019
110,3.0,Should visit but will probably not revisit ,"The taxi ride from our hotel in Gangnam-gu to Bukchon Hanok was 32000 won. What makes it worse was that the Naver Map direction didn't bring us to the correct spot. We were left at the end of the street near a park and had to walk for 20 minutes looking for the old village. Well not exactly old. Its a residential area with old houses and people still live in it. Snap some pictures and good to go. One of the checklist. And oh yeah, decent amount of climbing needed especially when with kids", September 2019
111,3.0,Quaint Village - Go Early!,"I wish I had read the prior review before wandering over to Bukchon Village. I have been to the neighborhood independently (not part of a tour group) a few times and it is lovely however, very crowded.  The area is located very near Insadong,  Gyeongbokgung Palace, and Changdeokgung Palace so a combined visit is absolutely possible.  You can get a little map of the area that slows ""8 views of Bukchon Village"" which is a nice guide for a non-guided tour visit.  Walking through just to enjoy the small homes, stores, and tea shops is also possible and enjoyable.  The major downside to visiting this area is the hordes of tourists dressed in Hanbok trying to take the perfect picture down the quaint alleyways - difficult to just enjoy when you are trying to dodge disrupting their photoshoot.", September 2019

115,4.0,Must visit for tourists,"Its a long alley filled with Korean traditional houses. It just gets crowded with tourists.

116,4.0,The Past Retained,"Located between the Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgong Palaces and just a short walk from the Anguk Metro Station you will find a little section of old Seoul retained. It is a mix of old and new, traditional and tacky but it is very interesting. Take the walk from Exit 3 from the station and walk up the hill . The place is well-signed and maps are available of the area showing the preferred walk.

For the rest of us, however, it's quite a boring place.

149,5.0,Fascinating place,"Fascinating area, still inhabited by regular people not just kept as a historical landmark. We stayed at one of the guesthouses in that area. Authentic hanok house. Amazing experience. Highly recommend to anyone. The only downside - streets are never empty, crowds of tourists are everywhere. Unless you wake up really early. Crowds take away some charm from this place.", August 2019
150,5.0,Past meets present. Bring comfy shoes.,"Bukchon was really the only thing I wanted to see in Korea. We went on a tour and I was quite disappointed, not by the village, but by the tour guide who rushed us through. It also started pissing it down raining. I managed to get some decent shots which I have to edit, but I could have used more time. The houses are all still inhabited and are worth upwards of a million dollars each. Although the facades are required to be preserved, the interior of the houses are all very modern and updated. There's signs asking tourists to keep their voices down, no loud pictures, music or talking. I guess some rude westerners had caused problems in the past. Anyway, bring comfy walking shoes as there are a lot of hills in the village. Bring a wide angle lens as well.", July 2019

190,3.0,Holiday,"I heard so much about this place I had to go. The issue for me is I was expecting a self contained village of original traditional style. The buildings are styled in the traditional sense but they are mixed between modern apartments and houses. There is really only one street with the same style of housing and the sight of air conditioners, wiring and hot water services detracts from the traditional aspect. There are attendants at each end of the street holding signs asking people not to make noise as this disturbs the residents. There are a few souvenirs shops and some very modern cafes in the village. Pleasant to look at overall but nothing like the promotion given to the area.", June 2019
