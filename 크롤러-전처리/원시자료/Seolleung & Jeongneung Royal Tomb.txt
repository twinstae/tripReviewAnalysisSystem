1,4.0,Seoulleung & Jeonneung Royal Tomb,"A beautiful UNESCO designated historical royal tomb area in the heart of Seoul not too far from Gangnam.  It is an impressive and well maintain area which is the final resting place for two Joseon Kings and one queen.  The grave mounds adhere to strict Confucian burial rites.  It is hard to believe that there is such a serene and peaceful area surrounded by office towers in the distance.  It is hard to imagine that this royal tomb area is only 20% of what the actual grounds were. There was a nominal admission charge,", November 2019

8,5.0,Nice quiet park,"This was a nice way to spend a couple hours. Very cheap to get in (1,000 won). They provide you with an English brochure. Tombs aren’t terribly exciting but the park itself is beautiful and it is hard to believe it is in the middle of the city. If you are nearby, you should stop and visit.", May 2019
9,5.0,ROYAL TOMBS,"It was autumn when we went to the Royal tombs, there were 8 tombs in form of hills.  A peaceful place to visit.", November 2018
10,5.0,Lovely park with interesting historical royal tombs ,"The tombs were a five minute walk from my hotel. I went around 0800 on a weekday and there were a lot of elderly Koreans getting in their morning excercise. The tombs were very interesting with stone guards at the top of the mound. You can only walk to the top of two of these and view from the side at the top but that is adequate . The entrance fee is $1000korean won, which is very cheap. I took the time to walk around the park and it was lovely. There was a very very old ginkgo tree, lots of cranberry and persimmon trees which were in fruit when I went. Beautiful Japanese maple were red with autumnal leaves. There were heaps of birds and I got to see a wild pheasant . A peaceful beautiful place to visit when in seoul", November 2018

14,5.0,Joseon Royal Tombs,"My husband and I visited the Royal Tombs of King Seongjong, Queen Jeonghyeon and King Jungjong. It was fascinating history learning about this royal burial site which is one of many around Seoul. The walk has hills and I recommend walking shoes as it’s gravel surface. Visit the History centre to see how the burial mound was formed and the coffin lowered into the ground and into a chamber. I would recommend this UNESCO World Heritage sure as a must see.", September 2018

16,5.0,Loved it,"I was just there yesterday as it was only a 5 minute walk from my hotel L7 Gangnam. I went for a nature walk and absolutely loved it. It's easy to walk and there are plenty of benches around for those who want to take a break. It was so green and pretty..almost felt as if walking in a forest. I went to 2 out of the 3 tombs, and liked the Korean traditional hanok houses but was really impressed more with the nature. I could believe such a peaceful place exists in Gangnam. It was so refreshing to take a walk and ponder. Would love to come back in the fall.", June 2018

Grate to buy a drink or coffe before coming into the park, food is not allowed. Very peaceful and near the Bongeunsa Temple about 15 minute walk. Definetly worth the trip if you're near the area. If your hungry they have many good and beverage options right in front the main entrance.", March 2018
22,4.0,Easily toured on your own,"Located about a 15 minute walk from the COEX convention center, this UNESCO site is easily toured on your own, and a nice oasis in the middle of the city. Only 1000 won ($1 US approx) to enter, you're provided a map with walking paths - most are dirt and there are hills so wear good walking shoes. There's a clean restroom inside near the entrance gate. Each royal burial mound has a fence around it so you can't get really close but the statues and mounds are visible enough. I spent about 30 minutes here but could have spent more (it was frigid and windy the day I visited!).", December 2017

27,5.0,History in the middle of the city,"This was the first place I visited in Seoul, it was AMAZING! The entrance is very cheap and it's a huge land where you can walk around for hours between trees and beautiful buildings. Downer is that you cannot approach the tombs, where the statues are, but it's very peaceful and you can see enough from the barriers.", August 2017
28,4.0,A peaceful oasis in Seoul,"This cultural landmark is a green, peaceful place for an historic stroll in the busy Gangnam area.  Allow an hour to walk and see the monuments and burial mounds.  The grounds are well maintained and the staff is helpful.  The entry fee is modest.  Be sure to approach from the correct side with the entrance gate -- it is a long walk around otherwise, and the location of the gate is not obvious on some maps.  I visited early Saturday morning, and there were only a few other visitors.  It's not a great photo op, but a nice thing to do if you are on a business trip and have a couple of free hours.", June 2017

34,2.0,It's interesting but can't see anything ,"Out of respect the tombs are fenced off/ closed off from the public, but if you feel like going for a bit of a walk in the park for 1000won and you have time to spare go for it. Otherwise the brochure itself will give you better photos than you can take in real life. If you have other items on your itinerary this definitely should not take priority.", February 2016

38,5.0,Silence Within The Busy City,"The Seonjeongneung tombs were easy to find from the metro station.

You can't get too close to the tombs but you can see the statues that are on top of it.", April 2015
39,5.0,Truly awesome - don't miss it!,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I made the journey via subway from Euljiro 1ga to this World Heritage listed site but was incredibly glad I made the trip. There are three royal tombs here and each one allows you to appreciate a different aspect of these massive structures. The sheer size of the earthen burial mounds and the impressive statues atop each tomb are awesome to see up close. There is no English information in the History Hall within the grounds but the English language brochure gives plenty of information about what you are seeing. If you have enjoyed learning about the Joseon dynasty in Seoul's museums and palaces, the tombs will be an enjoyable addition to your itinerary. It is quite easy to find one you get to Seolleung station and is a fascinating place to spend an hour wandering around.", July 2015

41,3.0,"Nothing to see here, move along...","Think of this as a nature preserve in the middle of the city rather than a tourist attraction.  If you are looking for a peaceful stroll along well maintained and wooded paths with lots of different types of birds, then this is your park.  However if you are looking to see the burial tombs and learn some Korea history, this is not your best option.", April 2015
42,4.0,Respect,"Heard about this park near my hotel in yeoksam. Thought it might be a nice place to go for a run. Not that kind of ""park"". I don't run through burial grounds. But an intriguing place to walk. Enjoyed the spirit stairs and spirit walkway that were off limits to visitors. Seems there were many birds on the property and the congregated near the burial grounds. Overall a fine experience. It is open until 8 pm. Think it might be interesting after dark but have yet to visit after sunset.", March 2015
43,4.0,Refreshing walk in the middle of Gangnam,"Seonjeongneung Park is located in one of the busiest area of Seoul, and still, while visiting it you may get the feeling you are in a quiet forest, a green oasis. This is a refreshing stop between COEX and Seollung area. The park itself displays tombs and relics of Joseon dynasty, with a few traditional Korean buildings. If limited in time, I would not go there on purpose, but if around, I would definitively stop again as a break. Small entrance fee.", January 2015
44,4.0,A quick and green getaway from surrounding Gangnam area,"A green area located in the middle of chaotic business district of Gangnam, containing the tombs of the 9th and 11th kings and one of the queens of the Joseon Dynasty. It serves as a peaceful and quick getaway location for the people working or living in the surrounding area which is full of plazas. Inside the green area, all the tombs have exactly the same setting and seeing any one of them is almost identical to seeing all. A spiked gate, then a T-shaped shrine and in an adjacent hill, the grave inside a mound and the statues of civil and military officials standing in front of the mound. It is worth a visit since admission fee is low and the park is beautiful and peaceful.", October 2014
45,5.0,Out of nowhere!,"Went out on a Geocache journey and found 3 near this area!! If it wasn't for that , I would not have found this great historic place! As of September 2014, the fee was 1,000won and well worth it! make sure you have enough time to visit all three tombs and to learn about them! Ensure you have the right clothes to wear because you will be walking on dirt. I came here at 6AM right when they opened and found that lots of people jog and walk around here for exercise!", September 2014
46,3.0,Seoul is a city with interesting food,"Have a good time there but hotel is a bit expensive. Seoul is considered a leading and rising global city, resulting from an economic boom called the Miracle on the Han River which transformed it from the ashes of the Korean War to the world's 4th largest metropolitan economy with a GDP of US$774 billion[14] in 2012 after Tokyo, New York City and Los Angeles. A world leading technology hub centered around Gangnam and Digital Media City,[15] it boasts the world's sixth largest[16] number of Fortune Global 500 multinationals such as Samsung, the world's largest technology company, as well as LG and Hyundai-Kia.

But I, as someone who is used to nature, did not think this place was special at all. The price to get in is very cheap and if you want to get away from the hectic way in Gangnam do go here. However, if you have ever been in a park or burial ground this place is not special at all.", May 2014
