42,5.0,Great giant mall for shopping,"I have been to many shopping malls in Korea, but this one is my favorite one so far. The mall is huge includeing E-mart in Basement 1 and 2, Shinsegae mall for the brand lovers or I should say rich guys. This place is full of live. Recently a electro mart is open besides E-mart. I like that place cause it has some unusual goods which can not be found shopping mall elsewhere.Being a father of a ~2 years old daughter, it would be nice to have kids zone in a big shopping mall. They got a nice one named Dalki. My daughter loved that place and enjoyed a lot ( 15,000 won for 3 hours for a kid and adult is 3000 won per person, which is reasonable I guess). Times Square does have all the brands you want. Great place for watching movie. Food zone was also very nice. Sometimes in weekend, it takes half an hour to park your car in the basement parking lot. Parking is free for first 30 minues, but it could rise up to ~15,000 won if you plan to stay there for 3-4 hours. A good tip is to shop at E-mart, or some other store which help to reduce this parking fee, even free sometimes. Please note that, all shop does not includes in parking fee exemption. This info can be found in the touch screen monitor located near by the escalor. I lost my parking ticket once, but the authorized person was kind enough and he let me go without any fee.Kyobo book store is a nice palce to be for the readers.

44,3.0,A big mall,"If you're familiar with malls, you'll be familiar with Times Square Mall. It's a big mall with a lot of local Korean and Western brands. When I went, there were even pop-up stores on the first floor. It's nice to check out but if you're looking for local goods, check out other places like Insadong or Bokchon.", April 2016
45,3.0,"Huge mall, great Emart, but Some distance out of town","Read about this new largest mall in Seoul, so decided to check it out.  It took about 25 minutes by Korea Rail/Metro to get there from City Hall station.  It's main anchor tenant is Shisegae and that is the first building you notice across the road when you step out of the Yeongdeungpo station.  It is not directly connected (at least I could not find the underground link) so it might be difficult to get to and from the station when it rains.It also has a large ecopark whe you can sit in fine weather to have a quick lunch.  I loved the huge Emart store spread across two floors in the basement, which sells everything from groceries and beers to car accessories and home linens, and everything in between it seems.  There are also the usual brand names you can find in any mall, such as LV and Coach, as well as high street stores like Charles & Keith and H&M.  If you are hungry, you can have Mexican food at South of the border, burgers from Lotteria and KFC, Japanese ramen and Viet noodles, and many more.I enjoyed visiting the pet and flower shops at the end close to Emart, where there were several puppies for sale.  As mentioned before, it is quite a distance from town, but you can make a day of it by exploring the streets of Yeongdeungpo anto see how the locals go about their daily routines.", March 2016

49,3.0,Convenient to the Courtyard Marriott and Yeongdeungpo Station,"I really like this shopping center as it is attached to the Courtyard Marriott at which I usually stay while in Seoul.  The mall has many shops and restaurants and is a great place to wander when the weather is bad outside.  There are tons of high end shops and many restaurants to include a few American chains.  There are Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts for those who need their coffee fix.  When too lazy to venture out for other local food options, this is where I go.", October 2015

55,4.0,Shopaholics Will Love This Mall. A Fun Place For Families and Tourists.,"Walking to the mall from another part of Yeungdeungpo-gu was nice and since the mall is big, I didn't have any problem finding it. The mall is perfect for those who love shopping. I bought a pair of very good walking shoes at less than KRW50000.00 there, a good price indeed. There's a cinema on the 5th floor.

58,4.0,More Awesome Shopping In Seoul!,"I have been to this mall every time I have visited Seoul (3x now) and while I enjoy the selection the mall has to offer (mostly mainstream brands like Muji, Uniqlo, Zara etc), you'd probably do better price wise in Myeondong/Dongdaemun/Gasan Digital Complex, especially if you're looking for Korean fashion.  That being said, this mall is huge and you could easily spend a day here.  It is quite a way from Myeongdong (where I usually stay when I visit Seoul), so you might want to take that into consideration if you have time constraints.  Also, if you go to the food court, it is self service.  That is, you order from a group of cashiers in the back, pay, and then you get a buzzer where you then go to the appropriate vendor to pick up your food.  At the time, I went, they didn't have English menus, so I had to take a picture of what I wanted and then show it to the cashier.  Also, I noticed August tends to be a big sale month and that there was a big event for SPAO (leading Korean clothing chain) selling clothes at bargain prices just outside the mall.  I do not know if this is a regular event, but probably something to keep in mind if you love their clothing.", February 2015
59,4.0,"Big, Very Modern - something for everyone","Very modern shopping experience - many high-end stores (Rolex, Prada, etc), but also local moderate priced places such as E-Mart.  Good food court, and a variety of restaurants throughout the 6 levels of the mall.  Very close to the subway station, and both Shinsegae and Lotte are big department stores that are right there in the area.  Easy to get a taxi if the subway is not your thing.  If you are looking for value-priced shopping venture to the lower mall levels, including the subway underground.  I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent Napa Valley wine selection at E-mart, pricier than the US, but many good selections nonetheless...  The mall opens promptly at 10:30 every morning (doors are locked until then), so no need to rush to get there too early.  ATMs that dispense Korean currency are conveniently located in the lower level of the mall.", December 2014

67,3.0,"Huge shopping mall, linked to subway, hotel on top","The shopping was huge, but mainly from the mainstream stuff (all the big brands, including Uniqlo, Northface etc). If you are looking for cheaper good, you will have better luck in areas like Dongdaemun and Namdaemum. The plus points is that it has a supermarket (e-mart) located in the basement that opens till midnight. Good thing for me, as I could buy cheaper beer, chips and tibits. Could even grab some last minute food like pizzas.... There is a kids theme attractions, but did not visit it as no kids with me. They do have information counters around, where you can ask for help. Although linked to the hotel, there is no way to walk from the shopping to the hotel without exiting into the open, as they cordon off areas of the shopping mall after 10pm. Might be a problem in the winter.

71,3.0,If you want to feel like you are back home...,"This review is designed for people who come from places like my husband and I (Aus and NA), may not apply to Europe or UK, and I hope others benefit as well.Imports of US goods with US branding are considered status items here.  They are 120-150% more expensive than the US, and even expensive by Aus standards.  My friends tell me this is normal UK pricing or cheaper.   Times Square is designed to feel exactly like an American (indoor) mall.  I go there sometimes to feel like I am in the West, but I don't by things, because I can see exactly what they cost back home online.  However, the space is nice and it's good to feel like I could be back home sometimes.  If you live here, it can be a good place to get home products that are better than usual Korean department stores, but less expensive than the high end department stores (I won't name them, but if you live here, you know which is which).  The fifth floor is high end restaurants. the lowest basement has common Korean shops.  First floor is the super expensive western status stores. and more mall like stores are sandwiched in between.  Has a cinema and On the Border Tex-Mex restaurant.  We've been a few times in a few years.", February 2011
