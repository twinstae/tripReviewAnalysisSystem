0,4.0,Hip place,"Daehangno is well known for the theatre in Marronnier Park, the Naksan Park, and Ihwa Mural Village. The closest subway to these places is Hyehwa Station. The theatre is the centre where many people gather to watch and enjoy free outdoor performances which are performed by students or young people on weekends. There are many restaurants and cafes to keep the night lively.", June 2019
1,4.0,"Nice area for theatre, dinner and drinks","Like Hongdae and Sinchon at the opposite end of Gangbuk, Daehangno has a distinctively youthful and laid back vibe, with shops and F&B places catering mainly to University students and young adults. The area is rather quiet even on weekend mornings, with crowds building up only 4pm streaming into the cinemas and many cafes in the neighbourhood. Walk away from the shops and cafes to visit the Ihwa mural village which has colorful, witty pictures handpainted on the walls of old buildings, returning to Daehangno in the evening for dinner and drinks. Those who do not fancy Korean food or Korean version of American grub may opt for one of several Thai and Vietnamese resthurants in the area. The pubs with alfresco seating offering craft beers, sausages and tapas are worth checking out too.", June 2018

4,5.0,Attractive place for young people,"It is just 15 minutes walk from Dongdaemun. Many arts were installed along the road which is quite attractive and humour sometimes. Many restaurants could be found, especially there are several Korean Barbecue and desserts shops. Fashion and Stationery shops could also be found here.", May 2017
