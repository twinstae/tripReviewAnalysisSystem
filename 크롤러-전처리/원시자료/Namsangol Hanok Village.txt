3,5.0,One of the most romantic fall attractions and panoramic view in Seoul,"If you want a good view of North Seoul Tower and its surrounding Namsan Mountains plus a beautiful garden right at the heart of Seoul then look no further than booking your nearest hotel in Namsangol Hanok Village which is near the Exit 4 and 7 of Chungmuro Station. By exit 4 turn left then right and you would see the entrance gate to this park. It was an accident that we didn't know the hotel we booked (Oriens - separate review) is nearby. Just 10 mins walk and whola were at the entrance. It is free for public and before the park there are many cafes', food carts and restaurants around it. Built in 1998 on the north side of Namsan Tower, the village has 5 restored Korean houses, gardens, pavilion, small streams, activity center, museum and small popup stores. Hanok means restored and its location is the original site for Jeonghakdong, a summer resort during the Joseon dynasty. The exhibit hall displays their traditional kitchen, clay pots, utensils, tea rooms, etc... There are toilets and this place is accessible by PWD. If you walk further south there is a hiking trail leading to N Seoul Tower and shuttle bus that can take you there directly. Parking is also available. When we visited there was a playground and activities set for the families and their kids. It was indeed a delightful surprise and experience for us to visit this park just right beside our hotel - one of the most scenic, romantic and beautiful attraction in Seoul. A quiet calming stroll here will take you breath away with its wonderful view and amazing attractions. Do come visit it guaranteed!!!", November 2019

6,5.0,Birthday trip,"I loved this tour. The steep inclines and quaint houses and shops is reminiscent of our tour in Tuscany (on much smaller scale). So picturesque, I can understand the attraction for tourists. But I sympathize with the residents having to put up with us taking selfies in their doorways. We only stayed for about 30 minutes. It’s a real look into the history of South Korea.", September 2019
7,5.0,Very nice,This Hanok village is easy to find and is walking distance from my hotel. The heritage houses are well maintained and is good to visit inspite of being free access, April 2019
8,5.0,A peek at Joseon culture and traditional houses,I didn't have high expectations as I went to Bukchon Hanok Village before; so reckon it'll be similar ie cafes housed in traditional houses etc. But at Namsangol Hanok Village (NHV) surprises me at every turn. First you can experience 1 hour sleeping time in the hanok (for a small fee). I thought that's a very refreshing experience in true sense of the word. Next you can rent traditional costume and take photos or pretend you're in a period drama and walk around the village. We also came across a gentleman who is a falconer and told us many information on this ancient heritage of korean falconry. The cafe nestled in the middle of the village is also very quaint and the souvenirs are worth looking at., July 2019
9,5.0,Excellent ,"We visited yesterday, 20/07/19, a family of 6 aged between 6 - 69. No entrance fee that we noticed. Information hut was on your immediate right after entry. Lovely clean toilets all the way round the area.  This trip was throughly enjoyed by all. It was a nice steady walk around the village and gardens. Fun games for the children to take part in as you walk, including a stamp collecting map for the children to find stamps as they walk around. Lovely village and So clean and well taken care of.  Some very large Koi fish in the lake which the children enjoyed watching. We could have hired traditional dress at the entrance but with the humid heat we would have struggled. I would happily go again for a lovely peaceful stroll.", July 2019
10,4.0,Good,, May 2019

15,4.0,Good if you plan on partaking in any activities ,"The village is very pretty but pretty small. We were nearby and decided to take a stroll inside but did not book any of the activities offered (archery making, tea ceremony, costume rentals, etc).

28,5.0,Lovely place and many activities for kids,"This place is conveniently located right in the heart of the city and worth visiting. Unlike Bukchon Hanok Village where you could only admire the houses from the outside, here you can actually get inside and walk around the houses. We were there on Sunday and there was a real traditional Korean wedding hosted so we got to observe the beautiful ceremony as well as the venue. Inside, there were few activities for kids to do too. While our daughter got dressed in Hanbok dress (10,000 won for one hour), our son enjoyed making a wooden bow and arrows. There were also craft and tae kwon do show in the afternoon. All in all, it was a very nice place to visit.", October 2018
29,5.0,Lovely Traditional Place,I found this beautiful traditional village across the street from our guesthouse in Seoul. It has 5 restored Korean traditional houses. The village is not to big but has a beautiful scenery with autumn leaves from the trees.

Entrance is free and also has autumn festival for foreigners. We attended one last Oct 27 of this year. The village also has a path to Namsam park.

35,4.0,Experience traditional Korean culture,"It is less crowded than Bukchon Hanok Village and the vibe is a bit different. It is also a nice place to try on the hanbok and take photos.

Very lovely garden to walk around with plenty of benches.", August 2017

43,4.0,A hidden jewel not mentioned by most tourist attraction lists -,I have been in Seoul several times and never made it to this Traditional Garden and Hanok Village. A local Korean friend of mine discovered it with me on a nice Sunday afternoon. It is only about a ten minute walk from the Catholic Cathedral., May 2018
44,3.0,"Nice scenery, otherwise a bit boring","The weather was nice, so it was beautiful to walk around and take some pictures of the nearby garden and small river that runs through. Otherwise a bit boring, but if you pass by anyway have a look.", April 2018
45,4.0,Peaceful place for a stroll or picnic,The Hanok homes here are lovely but they are only a small part of the appeal of this village.

48,4.0,Experience Korean Architecture,"I walked down from N Seoul Tower and took a quick walk through before heading to my next activity. It was a cold day when I visited, but it was still beautiful. I have a hunch that it would be a little more interesting at night with lanterns and lights and Seoul Tower in the distance. I would say that if you are in the area stop by. If you are going to Bukchon Hanok Village, then I'm not sure that there is anything new here. Although there is a lovely photogenic pond, so it's not a waste of time if you want to see both.", February 2018

I heard from other people it was pretty much traditional houses and nothing too special, but I have to say I really liked it and would visit again.

They also have a nice gift shop with beautiful and original gifts.", February 2018

Amazing!, January 2018
55,5.0,Awesome Self-Guided Walking Tour,"Beautiful area to walk around, it's very scenic with the traditional houses and the background of the Seoul industrialized city! Information/tourist booths can be found scattered around with maps and suggested directions to walk around the area.

You can even dancing with the performers. There are also some spot where you can try some Korean traditional game here.", November 2017
62,5.0,Better than Bukchon if you want to see Hanoks and like touching things!,"My take is this is a better bet for seeing Hanoks because Bukchon is a upperclass residential district set on a hill (people still live there, so you can't just walk in!)  In Namsangol, it is a reconstructed village (mostly of old houses that were moved there, and 1 replica), so you can walk around all you like - the other nice part is that it is near Myeongdong (Chungmuro), so easily accessible, and not hilly (unlike Bukchon!)", October 2017

Great experience, there was shows for the whole day, stalls for younger to participate in crafts, Korean families were picnicking, and food trucks selling Korean food.

70,3.0,Traditional but Underwhelming,"I enjoyed getting to see the traditional architecture at Namsangol Hanok Village (남산골한옥마을). I think this place is most suited for photographers and those with a strong interest in Korean culture. As a tourist, it was a little underwhelming as it is essentially just walking around and looking at the buildings. There is an area where you can watch martial arts or drink tea but it is otherwise a sight-seeing location only. If you are doing the Seoul City Bus Tour, it's worth taking 30 minutes to stop and look at it as it is free admission.", September 2017

This place is also near The KoreaHouse where traditional performances are held.", August 2017

82,3.0,Good place to visit - small but quaint,"I gave this place a 3 star rating because we didn't get the full ambiance of this visit. Due to a holiday in Seoul, many of the venues were closed but we managed to walk around the grounds.  If you're in Seoul for a very short visit this place would be good to visit because you can probably see it all of it within an hour or two. I wouldn't mind visiting this place again while it is  in full operation.", May 2017

It was more expensive than the rental inside the village, but the hanbok were beautiful and the husband and wife running it were very nice.   The woman even did our hair for us.

169,4.0,"Beautiful place, hours of sight-seeing","It is a beautiful village that gives you a feel of what life was like back in the days. The structures are beautiful, the gardens are beautiful, there are quite a few fun and cheap activities to participate in. We tried the tea ceremony, which is a one on two experience where a staff member brewed you a pot of tea and offered you a couple of different sweet snacks inside one of the buildings. Ok, the snacks were that good but it was the experience I was buying. For a small fee, we also had the chance to put on traditional Korean clothing (quite a few selection to choose from) and posed for pictures inside another building. I recommend going there early so there are fewer people. We get to experience the above activities on our own without other people in the way. Just after we finish with our traditional clothing, a few groups of people were already there waiting and ""fighting"" over their preferred clothes. Another activity I wanted to try was the brush calligraphy session but for some reasons, it wasn't available until a couple of days later. I didn't realise there are seasons to calligraphy writing... Anyway, overall it was a great place to visit, I recommend this place over the Gyeongbokgung Palace.", April 2016

I was there in the morning and it was not crowded at all. A really good way to start off the day before facing the crowds at other tourist attractions. I was able to admire the scenery and take pictures with no one at the background. My family took a tea appreciation experience workshop at the Hanok. It cost 4000 Won per person and it was a fun experience learning how to make tea with our pretty and gentle 'teacher'. We were served little snacks to go with our tea and we could take pictures inside the room with olden Korean decoration. There are other 'experiences' that you can take part in and they are generally not expensive.  If you have no time to visit  Korean Folk Village or Bukchon Hanok, take some time to visit Namsangol Hanok Village since it has a little of what both places have to offer.
