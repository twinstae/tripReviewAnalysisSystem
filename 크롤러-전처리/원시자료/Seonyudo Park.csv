0,5.0,Creative use of old infrastructure.,We found this park quite accidentally while in Seoul. The park is a short walk from Seonyudo subway station via a pedestrian walkway and bridge over the roads and river. Originally the site was a water treatment plant and it has been very cleverly converted into a very pleasant, October 2019
1,3.0,Tranquil park in Seoul city centre,"The park is in the city but it is not quite easily accessible. One could travel by subway to Seonyudo station and walk towards the river. There is a walk-bridge (Seonyudo Bridge) right opposite the hospital. It takes about 15 minutes to reach the park. Another way (which I took) is to travel to Hapjeong Station and take Exit 2. Walk to the middle of the nearby busy main road where there is a bus-stop (ID=14-012). Take Bus 603 and drop off at the next bus stop at the front of the park. I had to ask someone as there were two bus-stops and it was quite confusing. Fortunately the person could speak English. The park is not very big and on the weekday it was dead quiet, with just several people walking around. No attractive trees even in autumn. On the Seonyudo walk-bridge, one could get good views of the city. It is not really necessary for foreign tourists to go there.", October 2019
2,4.0,Pretty Island Park,"This is a lovely park, especially with many of itâ€™s beautiful trees turning their foliage to autumn tones. The park has many a good spot for a view or a private picnic. It has lots of shade trees and some great rolling lawn space. You can get a coffee and/or a pizza in the onsite, riverview cafe. It has a couple of performance spaces and it was fun to watch as teenagers gathered in a colourful group (nosebleed high shoes, aqua blue hair and youthful energy) to practise/film some choreographed group dance. Apart from the surrounding waterways there are internal water features and some good walking trails/paths. Parking nearby might be difficult but it didnâ€™t stop numbers of local. And yet the park didnâ€™t feel crowded.", October 2019
3,4.0,Interesting space on Hangang that feels like Gyeonggi,"I visited the park last Saturday. The park itself is not very big and easily walkable though if you have knee problems enter the park from the main gate where the bus stops because the bridge path from the subway has many stairs and the elevator does not work (at least at this time). I enjoyed walking in the bridge but I saw people with bikes struggling up the stairs, as well as the elderly. The park has many great picnic areas and spots, a play ground for the kids and resting areas. There are many maze-like walkable grounds such the bamboo path which I really enjoyed. Lots great opportunities for photography lovers and models alike ðŸ™‚. Great spot for a date, or just to relax. There is a cafe on grounds which I didnâ€™t visit, but if you miss it you wonâ€™t find any drinking water machines and might be dying out if thirst while there, so donâ€™t forget to bring your water bottle with you.", June 2019
4,4.0,Tranquil oasis in the middle of the city,"Seonyudo Park offers a place to escape the hustle and bustle of downtown Seoul - right in the middle of the city - on an island in the Han River. The park offers an interesting and clever transformation of a disused water purification plant into a contemporary botanic garden. As well as the display gardens, there are a number of paths around the island, a cafe, and plenty of places to sit and have a picnic away from crowds. This would be a great place to bring kids for a run around, as there is no traffic, no bicycles and no smoking on the island. Access by walking across the bridge from either Hapjeong Station or Dangsan Station. Alternatively, buses run from both these stations, stopping right on the bridge, at the entrance to the island. There is no cost other than your transport to get there.", May 2019
5,4.0,Great transformation of a water plant to a park,This is a unique park. It used to be a water treatment plant. Since I used to work in water treatment this park was extra appealing to me. I like how they were creative in reusing the facilities such as turning storage tanks into fish ponds. The park is on an island and a great place for a picnic. It is peaceful and well-landscaped., August 2018
6,5.0,Place to refresh for hardworking Koreans,"This is a fine little island park on Hangang(Han River) and is connected with the land by bridges.- Renovated and opened in 2002, there are still many people who don't know this place. I could find very few foreigners on the island as well.There's nothing much to have fun. There are a cafÃ© with a nice view, botanical garden, etc.- Since there's a much bigger Hangang Riverside Park before this, here's not that crowded.- Seeing some youngsters impersonating Japanese animation characters would be interesting.- You can take a look at both of north and south of Seoul.How to access:The entrance is on Yanghwadaegyo Bridge. Bus #7612 #5714 #603 #761. Walkable distance from Hapjeong Station.And there's the other high trail(Seonyugyo) to enter from south of Seoul. 15~20 min walk from Seonyudo Station.", May 2018
7,5.0,Hidden Gem of a Park,This is a great little park that's actually reclaimed green space from a now-defunct water purification plant.  The city of Seoul has done a nice job of restoring this island to its citizens and travelers alike to come and relax and see the city from a nice angle.There are plenty of benches and viewpoints to enjoy the view of Seoul from and several short walking trails that make for pleasant strolls.  Highly recommend a visit to escape from the concrete jungle!, April 2018
8,5.0,Great little island park!,"Very nice quiet park. Can get a bit crowded, but nice stroll to/from Yeoido. It has its own station, or you can walk from Dangsan on the green line.", May 2017
9,4.0,Intriguing place,"A Maze Runner-esque park set on an island that must be one of the most vast and tranquil open space in Seoul. The island is connected to the mainland by a bridge that you can cross, though it might not be for the faint-hearted. There's a glasshouse and some other facilities  (a museum probably?) that you can visit and also a cafe and a restaurant that offer an amazing view on the flowing river. There are gazebos scattered all over where you can take a rest and soak in the view. It's beautiful to visit at summertime and in autumn I imagine, however, seeing the park in late October was quite disappointing. The flora is dried up and it's overall pretty gray so I recommend visiting either in spring or summertime, there's a lot to discover if you're going for the first time!", June 2016
10,4.0,One of Seoul's Great Open Spaces,Set on an island in the Han River the park provides welcome open green space and leisure opportunities especially for locals but also visitors with some free time looking to escape the constant hub hub of down town SeoulTake Metro Line 9 to Seonyudo - follow the signs from Exit 2 and it is a good 15 minute walk, September 2016
11,4.0,Seonyudo Park,Great place to escape crowds of tourists and relax after a long day of sightseeing. It's a quiet park with mysterious atmosphere. I went there during sunset and tha was the best decision: the views were really beatiful., May 2015
12,4.0,A pleasant escape from the city on a nice day,The other reviews are spot on. This is a very pleasant destination when the weather is nice and you want to take a break from the energy that surrounds you in Seoul. It's a great place to see the city from a different viewpoint., October 2015
13,4.0,If you have extra time in Seoul,"This place is peaceful and lovely.  If you need any down time while visiting in Seoul,  this is the place to walk around.  Mainly, local people went there for relaxing.  It has a piano to play with and green house and museum to browse through.  We went there as a part of two day private tour with This is Korea.  Our tour guide Jay brought us there. We enjoyed it very much.", June 2015
14,4.0,Rather deserted,"When I went, it was early morning during the hottest summer days. The cicada sounds were deafening, so I toured the whole park in 45 minutes. A lot of areas were cordoned off, so there wasn't much to do. However, I found a Before I Die exhibit there which was rather interesting to look at. There're blanks for you to fill in the thing you want to accomplish before you die.  Other than that, there were greenhouses and other horticulture related structures. Personally, I'm not very interested in horticulture, but they did have a variety of plants and flowers. It would be better if the park was better maintained, though.", August 2013
15,4.0,Lesson in Urban Gentrification,"Once the site of water treatment plants, Seonyudo Park (open 6 am until midnight year-round) is a small island on the Han River connected to the mainland by a beautiful arch bridge, with Seonyudo subway station on the brand-new line 9 located 10 minutes away.  Part of Seoul's many urban renewal projects, the industrial site has been replaced by an aquatic botanical garden with blooming water lilies, a popular playground for couples and families alike.  To learn more about the ecosystem and the ambitious Hangang Renaissance Master Plan, visit the Hangang History Museum before grabbing a quick bite at the self-serve cafÃ© Naru overlooking the Han.", July 2012
