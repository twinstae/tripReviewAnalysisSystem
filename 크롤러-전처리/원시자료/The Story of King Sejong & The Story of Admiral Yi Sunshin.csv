0,4.0,Total surprise,"While in the square, I was looking for a bathroom.  Behind one of the statues was a door.  Hmmm.  Bathroom, perhaps?  Yes... and much more.  What a great (and free) museum of early Korean history and culture.  Great also to warm up when its cold outside... and they have", November 2019
1,5.0,Interesting museum and small hands on activities,"After visiting GyeongbukongPalace, this museum is across the street. You will notice it because of the large statue of King Sejong and Admiral Yi opposite from each other.  The museums are below street level and are connected to one another.  Here you can learn about the Korean alphabet and writing as well as the war history. There are small activity tables where you can do many activities such as standing and learning Korean calligraphy.  There is no charge for this Museum.", June 2019
2,5.0,Extremely Prominent Figures in Korea's History,"We trudged through Seoul's huge Gwanghwamum Square, looking at its offerings, and noted an entrance to this museum behind the big statue of King Sejong. As we knew nothing about this king nor Admiral Yi Sunshin, we decided to enter. The museum is divided into two big exhibition halls in the basement of Sejong Center. Information on King Sejong is presented in the west wing with the admiral featured in the east wing. A section containing a library, gift shop and snack shop separates the two halls. We found the museum to be nicely curated and filled with fascinating exhibits about these two extraordinary men.King Sejong (1397-1450) created Hangeul, the Korean alphabet. A scholar, he contributed to the development of science, music and technology in Korea and expanded its territory. His story is told through a multimedia approach. Children seemed to be interested in many of the displays and lined up to sit on the replica of the king's throne. Admiral Yi Sunshin (1545-1598) led the Battle of Myeongnyang, defeating the Japanese Navy in the Imijin War. No fan of military history, I still became quickly engaged with the displays, which include his naval battles and the tactics used as well as weapons and artifacts used in battles. For me, the piece de resistance proved to be the replica of a Turtle Ship, which earned the name because its roof vaguely resembled a turtle's shell. Created by the admiral, this vessel was the world's best assault ship of the time. It easily sank enemy ships because of the ability to fire at close range.I think that history buffs would find this museum to be well worth visiting. It is easily accessed by bus and metro lines. Open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., it is closed on Monday. Admission is free.", November 2018
3,5.0,A lovely little underground find!,We saw the two statues and decided to explore further.  Lovely little find - on our way to Gyeongbukgong Palace  - all underground - and a great experience to learn more about Seoul's history.  A great surprise and really fascinating!, April 2019
4,5.0,Experiential learning of history at its Best,"Walking back from the Gyeongbukgong Palace towards the Cheonggyecheon stream, we chanced upon this two statues in the middle of the busy street. When we went near, it led us to the discovery of an underground museum. A gem for anyone who wants to learn the history of King Sejon, families and kids joined the activities. I found the second part of the museum on Admiral Yi SunShin fascinating as actual artifacts are displayed together with his story of bravery and innovation in ancient war fare - all in both Korean and English. There is even a 3D theatre with fixed times for an about 12 min show.", September 2018
5,5.0,Seoul is awesome and this underground museum was an unexpected but delightful surprise!,"My fellow flight attendant and I decided to hop over to Korea for the first time and I’m so pleased we did!  As a New Yorker I could really appreciate the bustling crowds and the contrast of natural beauty, with historical architecture at every bend. We decided to visit the King’s monument after meandering about Gyeongbokgung Palace and I was absolutely delighted! Not only could we escape the heat but there were all sorts of lovely exhibits and a really cool interactive sundial display... we took photos on some of these fantastic benches made from words but we have no idea what they say! If anyone knows please find me on IG @ KolaCares and say hi lol. Can’t wait to go back- I pray for peace in politics because this lovely, civilized city deserves to be preserved (just beware the “disregard” for lack of personal space lol, Korean certainly do crowd too much.)", September 2018
6,4.0,Fascinating,"Above the museum is the statue of the King, and that of Admiral Yi, on a area between two of the main highways leading to the Gyeongbokgung Palace gate. It is opposite the US embassy and there are plenty of bus stops there. The statues are huge and really dominate the area.  The underground museum, telling of the king's life and works, are here and access is free.", May 2018
7,5.0,Informative,The monuments above the memorial museums are beautiful. Below them you will find the memorial museums. The entrance is on the side with the King Sejong statue.  Both museums offer informative information on the two individuals in Korean history. On King Sejong's side of the museum there is a replica of a throne that you can sit on for pictures and on the Admiral's side you will find a replica of a ship. There are also lots of places within the museum for picture taking., March 2018
8,3.0,Free museum ,"The story of King Sejong is a museum, which is dedicated to this famous king of Korea. He is known for the creation of Hangul, Korean phonograms. The museum is located near the statue of king. The entrance is free.", February 2018
9,5.0,Well-made and FREE museum,"Gwanghwa-mun is the greatest tour area in Seoul, and this museum is under Gwanghwa-mun. It means you can easily go to Palaces, traditional Korean houses or other museums. This is not a only good thing of this museum. You can see and hear about great Korean history, General Yi and King Sejong. 4D Cinema is also free, after that you can write your name in Korean letter by traditional way. On weekend, there are so many kids, so I recommend on weekdays.", February 2017
10,5.0,Informative if you are interested in Korean history,"I seldom enjoyed reading about historic stuff in museums, but this turns out to be a surprise hidden gem all cos I was trying to hide somewhere from the cold! I remember entering from behind the statue of King Sejong on Gwanghwamun.Initially I only saw a long frame with loads of korean letters and words and wanted to leave. But I decided to walk deeper and realise.... I saw this place on Running Man before!! Got excited and I continued to explore this free museum. I find it quite interesting and how the information and graphics are being done for the exhibit. At one of the counter, I even picked up a comic book talking about the Admiral Yi Sunshin.I actually find it enjoyable and spent 45 mins here. One of the hidden gems that I would recommend to visitors to Seoul!", December 2016
11,4.0,Very well made underground museums,We went down just for the King Sejong's museum but Admiral Yi's museum was also there. That was awesome! I prefer Admiral Yi place than Sejong's. Quite well made to show how he commanded his navy during the war. It is a must to see if you are at Gwanghwamun., July 2017
12,4.0,2 statues of Korean heroes,"King Sejong the Great's statue located in the  光化門廣場Gwanghwamun Square (광화문광장)of the Joseon Dynasty is credited with introducing Han Chinese Confucian policies and executed major ""legal amendments"" (공법; 貢法) in the fifteenth century plus the capture of Tsushima island from the Japanese .", May 2017
13,4.0,"A ""wonderful underground"" museum :)","Displayed in this underground museum are the achievements of the two ""most celebrated"" figures in the history of Korea, namely King Sejong the Great (the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty) and Admiral Yi Sun Shin (famed for his naval victories against the Japanese in the Imjin War of the 1590's) although the two figures belonged to different periods of history (the king preceded the admiral by about 200 years).The ""greatest thing"" to see here is a wooden replica of Yi Sun Shin's turtle boat (not life-sized but I would guess about a third the size of the actual boat) that you can go inside where I was actually ""pleasantly surprised"" by these nice figures (quite realistic-looking really although they are also about a third the size of an actual human) of sailors ""in action"" kind of presumably re-enacting a naval battle scene of the Imjin War; and actually to enhance that ""stationary viewing"", there's also a 4-D documentary show (just near the boat) where you'll get an ""up-close experience"" of a naval battle of that war (watched the 3-pm show, just like under 10 minutes though).  Also, looking at the info displays, I was able to make a ""history connection"" between this place and the Osaka Castle in Japan (that I'd visited just over a week earlier) since the lord of that castle was the leader of the Japanese side in the Imjin War; and also there among the info displays about the life of the Admiral is a ""statement of praise"" by the famous British general of WW2 Bernard Montgomery (who must have learned about this great Korean admiral of like 350 years before his time). And on the King's side of the museum (which you'll actually get to before getting to the Admiral's side, but just that ""more interesting"" things are on the Admiral's side as mentioned above), be sure not to miss these miniature figures in display cases behind glass along the wall (embedded in the wall) which is like a ""narrated sequence"" of the events leading to the creation of the Korean alphabets (they were created either by King Sejong himself or by some scholars under his supervision); I was also ""pretty impressed"" by the King after reading the info display of his instructions to the subordinates to be equally kind to all elderly people whether they were rich or poor and to help out poor bachelors to get married (no wonder such a considerate king  was the greatest Joseon king).Coming by subway, Gwanghwamun Station (on Line 5) is where to get off where you'll be right between the big statues of the King & the Admiral when you come out of the station, and the entrance door is ""right behind"" the statue of the King with the stairway inside the door leading down to the museum below.  Also, Gyeongbokgung, the biggest of Seoul's five palaces, is just about a 5-minute walk north from the statue of the King (you'll see the first gate of the palace straight ahead to the north from behind the statue).", June 2016
14,3.0,More for Koreans,"These two are very important people in Korean history but if you are not a history buff walking through show cases of their writings that are all in Korean doesn't click. There was an interesting bit on the Korean language and how it is built up and how the general fought some of his battles. It is free and out of the elements, so have a walk through.", January 2017
15,5.0,Facinating,What a fascinating piece of Korean history! Deep below his statue in the heart of the city is a very well curated history of this wonderful leader and the story of how he developed a new language for his people. Experience such as this one are why we travel!, December 2016
16,3.0,Too much information ,"Way too much information at this museum, I was confused with so much story telling, activities available at this place. It's a rather small compound, with 2 wings.", December 2016
17,5.0,Lovely Hidden Museum,"I live in Seoul and stumbled upon this museum while wandering around the square with some friends. It is one of the best surprises I've had seeing doors in the back of the King Sejong statue. Going down I never expected the quality and beauty of the museum.It is very popular with local families with young children as there are a lot of iterative displays from going inside a turtle ship mock up, to shooting fake guns at ships, to trying to row a massive ship.I enjoyed the detailed specific history on 2 of Korea's most important heroes. There was wonderful media usage (as always with Korean museums) and it was nice to have a museum so focused in terms of content - you don't get overwhelmed or lost here and learn a lot about these 2 men. The explanation of Hangul is very interesting to see!I always take people here when they visit me and it is always one of their favorite stops - usually preferred over the National Museum due to size and the ability to absorb the information.", September 2015
18,4.0,Yet another thing to do in Gwanghwamun Square,"The statues of these two very important figures in the history of Korea are spectacular, and are located in Gwanghwamun Square.  I've reviewed the statues and posted photos on their respective TripAdvisor sites, and mentioned this place too. The fearsome Admiral Yi Sun-Shin also gets space in the War Memorial of Korea, which has a very large replica of his ""Turtleship"", which had a studded roof to prevent boarding by the Japanese navy.But under Gwanghwamun Square is a - museum I guess I'd call it - depicting the stories behind Admiral Yi and Sejong the Great King whose statues sit above.  It's worth looking for the entrance in the Square.You can learn more about these historical figures and their achievements in this display.  Both were extraordinary, larger-than-life characters.  No wonder they are so remembered in Korea.  There's even a 2014 movie about Admiral Yi - called ""The Admiral"".", March 2016
19,4.0,Include in your geokbogung tour,After your geokbokgung temple tour cross the street to reach the king sejong statue. Below is the museum of king sejong and admiral yi. Take note this tour are FREE. End your tour by proceeding to gqhamun square for shopping., February 2016
20,4.0,"Learning the history about hangeul, turtle ship","We visited this place after seeing the King Sejong statue. It is a small place, you can visit it for 1 hour. We learned about the history of hangeul and our kids tried to write her name using hangeul. Then we got into the ship. It was good to look around. We tried to construct the ship by using the blocks.Overall, it was nice to visit here and it was warm", December 2015
21,5.0,"History fans, you gotta see this!","I had read about Admiral Yi Sun Shun and Sejong Daewang before I came to Seoul. Nobody, not even my Korean friends, told me about this centre even when they knew I loved museums. It's good that I found it. The museum was intended for school students, I suppose, middle school and younger. That's why they have more of interactive media, pictures, exhibits and so on. And the best thing of all is they have English guide, so even though it's not a  very big museums like Melbourne museum, they have so many things you can explore. If you are like me, and like to read everything in a museum, then expect to spend at least 3 hours in there. There is also a small souvenir shops and they sell good stuff and are not limited to coasters, pens, mugs, you know, the typical museum stuffs. And oh, they also have got a miniature of the famous Turtle Ship!!", May 2015
22,4.0,Quality experience if you want to learn more about King Sejong Admiral Yi Sun-Shin,"For those wanting to learn more about two of Korea's most important historical figures, there is a dedicated underground museum called 'The Story of King Sejong & The Story of Admiral Yi Sun-shin' (free entry) situated between Gwanghwamun Square and Sejong Centre for Performing Arts building. Opening Hours 10am to 8pm daily. Here you will find combined space with information displays related to the lives of both great men.  I particularly enjoyed seeing the replica turtle boat, famously created by Admiral Yi Sun-shin to opposed Japanese naval fleets and to defend Korean shores at the end of the 16th century. You can also learn about the creation of the Korean alphabet here as well. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with 'The Story of King Sejong & The Story of Admiral Yi Sun-shin' another of Seoul's free attractions and a quality learning experience that can be conveniently had if sightseeing in the area. It is well worth making a stop here before or after a visit to Gwanghwamun Square and nearby World Heritage attraction - Gyeongbokgung Palace.", November 2015
23,4.0,check out the 4d experience hall and feel the wind,"we went inside by accident as the entrance /attraction is not well sign posted but it was worth a visit. It was pretty empty and they had craft activity - by paying 2000W (?) you can make you own name bracelet in beads. I didnt know anything about the General and he had a very interesting story and also why the king was so popular. There were a lot of different visual format medium (paintings, text, sculptures) and the boat (a replica) was impressive because it put the story into context. tips use the free mp3 to help you guide through teh exhibitionget you photo taken on the Eojwa- the royal throne- and feel like royalty for a minplenty of seating so rest your legs my fave was the 4d experience cinema - they give you glassess and the chairs move and its in english so you can enjoy the expericne more. its free and its not just for kids- its the most fun thing in the museum!open till late so ideal to pop in.- in basement so cooling and peaceful from teh outside", September 2015
24,5.0,Salute!,"Both are great figures of South Korea, so be sure to stop by here to learn about their great contributions to the nation. The exhibitions are great, along with videos with subtitles about these two. The exhibitions are interactive, beautiful and clearly depict the stories.", November 2015
25,5.0,"Interesting, extensive, accessible. Learn about the Korean alphabet and its inventor","Here you'll learn about King Sejong and Admiral Yi. I'm gonna focus on the Sejong bit though because its what I know the most about.This is one of my favourite museums because:a) Its freeb) It's all about the Korean Alphabet, Hangul - arguably one of the easiest and most economical in the worldc) It's kinda hilarious and cheesyYou'll learn about the history of the language (more fun than it sounds) and the various policies Sejong implemented during his reign and scientific advances which his reign encouraged in Korea (aka Joseon at the time). He's highly regarded in Korea as a great reformer, educator, liberator and all around nice and clever guy, and he appears on the 10k won note so go learn about the man who helps you buy all that samgyeopsal.My tips:1. Make it a priority to see the video about the king. Every 15 mins it runs with English subtitles. They are a bit confusing because voices speak over each other a lot but you'll get it. It's a good summary of what he did in his life.2. Get the voice guide pack, it's free as long as you give them some ID as insurance3. Bring your passport as ID!4. Try writing your name in hangul! They have a table to the right as you come in where the staff help to translate your name into the Korean Hangul representation to paint onto rice paper. Very cool.If you still have energy after that, go say hi to Admiral Yi too.One point of concern with this place is how biased it is. One or two things about Sejong are negative things framed positive, but its still hugely worth doing.Enjoy!", July 2015
26,4.0,Great for a Quick Stop,"The experience here lies somewhere between a museum and a single exhibit. It's worth a walk-through, if only to experience the miniature turtle ship (which was fascinating for me). And it's free, which is always wonderful.Admiral Yi Sunshin is one of Korea's foremost military heroes, and the decisive battle for which he's best associated, the Battle of Myeongnyang in 1597, really is an amazing display of seamanship and sheer courage. Here you'll learn about the specifics, view relics of the era, and read various details of the Joseon Dynasty and its wars.Recommended, especially for military-history buffs.", November 2014
27,4.0,Admiral Yi is a Korean hero!,"I'll freely admit I know very little little about Korean history, but I learned more about Admiral Yi and King Sejong in these two free museums and their influence on the development and history of Korea than I thought possible. They are revered by Koreans. King Sejong is the Father of Korea, an innovator and an innovator. Much was done to advance Korea in many ways under his rule.Admiral Yi was a naval hero who fought off the Japanese invasion and while seemingly outnumbered he saved the day and forced the Japanese navy to retreat! Wow, what a man!There's a wonderful FREE (pick up a ticket in advance at the booth outside) 4D movie you can watch about the famous battle. Yes, 4D. You'll wear 3D glasses but your seats will also move and (well, I don't want to spoil the surprise) let's just say it's a naval battle and water is involved!Very fun discovery right on the plaza. We found it educational and entertaining!", July 2015
28,5.0,Learn about Korea's famous king,"My recommended length of time is based on reading everything because that's what I did. The museum is not really very big -- if you don't read anything, you can probably walk through in about 15 minutes. You can learn a lot in this small museum and understand a lot of Korean history. It was especially interesting to learn the origins of Hangul and what the letters are meant to represent. This king made a lot of contributions to Korea. He was an inventor and seems to have really cared for his people. (education, equality, etc).  It's very kid friendly. You can sit on the chair/throne at the beginning and take pictures. There are some kid activities in the museum, some short films (I didn't watch those so I can't tell you about those), and there is a juice shop inside -- I don't know if they serve food.", August 2015
