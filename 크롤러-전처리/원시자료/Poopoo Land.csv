0,5.0,Fun place to explain human needs to children,Poo poo and wee wee are the two of the most intriguing human elements for young children. This museum has a fun approach to explain the mother nature calls. A fantastic educational activity for parents and children!, July 2019
1,5.0,Fun for small kids,Very fun place! Both our kids (4 & 9) had a lot of fun taking pictures and exploring the digestive system.The location at TripAdvisor is wrong. It is about 250 to the south at the SM duty free Mall next to running man!, November 2019
2,5.0,The place is quite good for my 5 years old boy,The place is very lovely But a little too small There are people writing in various places that makes it look dirty., March 2019
3,4.0,Fun for kids! 1h max,"Super fun visit! Very easy to find especially for us non-korean tourists. Located at B1 of a duty free dept store. Really great experience, brought my seven year old son and he loved the entire place. The main part is the digestion simulation which was really fun and pretty educational, though only takes about 10min to complete. You could really stretch the time out here though, and they give you a scavenger hunt with pins as a reward after as well. Luckily it's also across from Runningman so you can spend time there as well (although not great for young kids)! Also located near lots of restaurants.", October 2019
4,4.0,My kids loved it,"A silly and funny place, good for laughs. It's not huge and you can easily get around it in 30 mins without crowds. A bit difficult to find as it's inside a building with no obvious signage. Wouldn't go out of my way to come here but worth it if you're nearby and want some silly entertainment. Don't go through the tunnel inside the mouth if you get claustrophobic or have young kids who get scared of small/dark spaces. Can opt out through a side door.", September 2019
5,4.0,Kinda silly but another must if you're doing museum tours.,This is a small amusement park in the bottom of SM Coex (somehow fit there) where you can learn about digestion. Unfortunately some of the information is in Korean only but there are lots of photo opportunities for you to have when you go in and explore. The discover Seoul pass gives you a 1000 won discount on the entry fee making it 8000 won. You also receive a question sheet to answer (in english). The park has a few staff walking around so if you need someone to take a photo it is possible. There are lockers nearby. The park is mostly a pleasant walk through various areas including photo perspective exhibits and it indicates in each area which question is answered by which area. Unfortunately the numbers dont quote match up near the end but you can figure it out. The final area has a small slide you can climb up to and a little house which you can enter. Theres also a funny little dance club. It doesnt require much physical fitness but one should be aware that there is a rope type bridge in the middle of the park so if you have trouble walking you may struggle. If you answer the questions right you get a little gift. I had a lot of fun with my friend at this place but a couple of the exhibits were worn out and old. The name in Korean is also a pun about poo lol., September 2019
6,5.0,10/10 would shet again,holy shiet it was greati got to see poop to smell poop and to shiet poopit was not as poopy as i expected, September 2019
7,5.0,Small but fun,"We visited on the 25 Jul 19.  It‚Äôs in a high rise building on one of the floors, it‚Äôs signposted everywhere so very easy to find.  To get there take line 1 subway from Janggak station exit 3, it‚Äôs a three min walk from there. Prices W7,000 each.  The children get a quiz sheet with they can fill in all the way round which they loved. What we enjoyed about this attraction was that every room was a different room which explained the digestive tract, until you get to the poop.  There were rooms with bouncy balls, intestines which were like bouncy castle walls That you had to squeeze through. Once you get to the end you can go through a door to do it all again, you don‚Äôt feel rushed to leave. My children did the circuit 3 times.  They also give you coins that you can throw in a poop wishing well at the end, google translate had us giggling at our fortune.  I would say it‚Äôs an interesting hour of fun tops, not the three hrs advertised but It was a good, I would recommend. When you purchase your ticket you can buy a package to enter the running man next door. This looked fun but the queue was massive and it was very energetic, one of our party was sporting a leg injury so we couldn‚Äôt participate but we could hear loads of giggles. I would recommend!", July 2019
8,4.0,PooPoo Land Visit,"A great place for Boys.  How can you not laugh at Farts?  Only takes 30 minutes to visit this small museum but, funny.  Kids loved it.", May 2019
9,4.0,complements running man activity,"To do this alone is not really that worth the effort to go all the way here. But we were here for running man, and poopoo land right beside running man is a great complement.This deals with the unique experience of anything to do with the word ""poo"". This is actually another version of those trick eye museums but exclusively for the poo.", June 2019
10,5.0,Fun and unique experience!,It was a unique experience for exploring poop's world. It a really nice place for children and fun place for adult., May 2019
11,5.0,Hilarious kid fun for all,A little hard to find but once you do you will find a humorous mini attraction focusing on poop. The whole exhibit has many photo ops and a funhouse traveling as food moves throughout the body and transforms into poop., March 2019
12,4.0,Fun activity,"If you are easily to offend this is not for you. This is good for weird photo opps and laughs or farts. They have little quizzes but not all are for English speakers. However, it was fun to experience bowel movement or different farts. It is a great indoor activity and for sure something to talk about at home.", May 2019
13,4.0,Fun place to play,"We came over here from Dragon Hill Lodge with our 13, 7 and 5 year old. It‚Äôs very much appropriate for little ones as my 13 year old just giggled about it the whole time. Only takes about 20 min to complete but you can complete the trip again. Lots of places to take silly pictures!", April 2019
14,5.0,Loved it,First of let me just say I recommend this place for any person who laughs at anything related to poop üí©. There is a nice view of a huge poop emoji and everywhere you go you hear moaning and farts üêò üí®. In all if you love poop and get a laugh out of it this is the place for you my friend., March 2019
15,5.0,So fun,"It's a little ""museum"" with high entertainment value. Entrance costs 9000 won. On Saturday afternoon the place was packed with families. Even though I came here alone, I had a lot of fun. It'd be better to bring someone along to take photos of each other though. The location of the museum wasn't signposted, maybe because it moved to a new location recently. It's on the B1 level of the SM Duty Free building, although it does not appear on the floor map at all. It's within a walking distance of Alive Museum, so you can combine the two easily.", March 2019
16,5.0,Great fun!,"We struggled to find this place originally as we thought it was in Ssamzigil shopping block, however we found it had moved in July 2018 to the basement of SM Duty Free Building - about a 5 minute walk away. It wasn't the cheapest place to visit but it was a bizarre and surreal experience which was full of laughs! It probably only takes around 10-15 minutes to get through but you can go through the course as many times as you like. We went in the evening and we had the place to ourselves.", December 2018
17,5.0,Actually very fun and very irreverent..,"Me and my family just went today. My family thinks farts are funny, so we really got a kick out of this. All the photo opp's are great for Facebook, when we get back home!", November 2018
18,3.0,interesting place for kids,"Not sure on how to initially react when I saw this place. It was odd but fun for young kids especially when eveything your child say is ‚Äúpoop‚Äù... hahaha! This place was hard to find, I saw it while I was walking around Insadong. The entrance is not bad, the inside is full of rubber poop in different colors and toilet seats. Price $6.", March 2018
19,3.0,"Okay for kids, meh for adults.","I was stoked (perhaps overly so) about visiting Poopoo Land. And at first glance, I was not disappointed. The entrance is graced by a large backside that you walk under, and the short flight of stairs inside plays various fart noises with each step. But this is geared toward kids who might not mind spending money on a 10 minute excursion through the alimentary canal. (Be aware, parts of the attraction are completely dark and a tight squeeze. Might be an issue if you are claustrophobic and/or afraid of the dark.)It's kind of cool to go down the ""colon"" slide at the end. You essentially become a piece of poop. LOLI'm not sorry I went, but wish I had known more what it would be like so I wouldn't have been as disappointed. It was just too brief for the money they charge, and largely populated by children.", May 2018
20,3.0,Entertaining,"I personally find it interesting and humorous, this place is small and activities are short and you will be done in 15mins. i personally would prefer to do something else, this is not for me.", April 2018
21,3.0,CRAPTASTIC,"I think part of the allure of this attraction is that it's not readily visible. It's in a little shopping plaza off the main (on weekends) pedestrian zone, and even once found, it takes a little bit of time to be sure that it's the right place (To be fair: I speak/read only a little of the language. There might have been big signs saying ""PooPoo Land this way"" for all I know....).It's great for kids and adults who still giggle at farts. There are a lot of stations for funny poop/fart/toilet photos. It's not huge--- if we would have known, we probably would have taken a little more time at each station.  Also, once inside, the only easily-skipped thing is the slide. I only mention this because I crawled through the ""digestive tract"" features while carrying my coat, my kids' sweatshirts, a camera, my purse, and a few bags we collected while shopping on the way....that was a mistake. Travel light.All in all, it was a fun, silly, probably-one-time thing. I don't see myself rushing for a repeat visit, but we all had a good laugh and got some great pics and memories!", April 2018
22,5.0,Toilet Humour at its Finest!,"Stumbled upon this place by accident and its a great way to kill an hour! You walk up the steps to fart noises and step into a big butt shaped door - it is not subtle. It's structured like an amusement park attraction where you walk through the exhibit from start to finish - you can't go back once you pass go. Couldn't stop laughing throughout the entire experience - the best part was getting to be a nugget and going through the obstacle course meant to simulate food moving through bowels. There's an awesome slide at the end with a serious drop. Cheap thrills and a very cheap price! You don't need to book, we just paid our ticket (about $8 each). Best of all, its in a very hipsteresque area near the Poop Cafe and other cute little gift stores so once you're done you can get a poop themed coffee and a poop shaped pancake, and wander around (non-poop themed) stores. Advice: avoid if you don't have a childish sense of humour and think poop is hilarious. Best experienced with a friend or partner with the same mindset, or with children (it is surprisingly educational).", April 2017
23,4.0,PooPoo Land,"I think that Poo Poo Land is really funny place, but if you want to go slowly and have fun go there early. Because small kids can be little bit dangerous and tiresome.Poo poo Land jest naprawde ≈õmiesznym miejscem, ale trzeba tam i≈õƒá rano.", February 2018
24,3.0,Poopoo Land,"Enjoyable place for kids. In fact it is quite narrow inside, difficult to move, especially when crowded. However, kids are enjoying. Location is easy to access. Entrance fee should be much less in my opinion, as there is nothing special in terms of fine arts or history, compared with so many and cheap museums in Seoul.", February 2018
25,4.0,Hilarious! But only in Korean,"My girlfriend and I visited this for fun and we had a blast. It was fairly cheap and pretty short, but all the sounds and ""art"" was hilarious. The real negative was that everything was in Korean, so any info/signs I couldn't read. Great for a little stop by though!", February 2018
26,3.0,Fun but 1 time visit- mainly for kids/teens,The place is small so you will be less than 30minutes in there. It‚Äôs funny since the entrance because of the fart noises. Some things are so real that are disgusting. There is also a theme restaurant which I didn‚Äôt wanted to try because it‚Äôs beyond disgusting for me., December 2017
27,1.0,Not worth the time ,My family went thinking the place would be fun and break from all the historical sites but was disappointed how short and dull it was. There were maybe 3-4 photo worthy spots for laughs without any educational benefit. My 6 and 7 year olds walked away unimpressed..., September 2017
28,3.0,My kids loved it!,"My kids loved it! Too bad, the activity just took twenty minutes to complete. Price was reasonable for a one time visit.", May 2017
29,3.0,Disorganized little thing,"I was kind of excited about seeing what this thing was all about. There weren't many clues about what it is online and it looked like wacky fun. It still was wacky fun, but I was a little underwhelmed. The museum is very short. It's a handful of fart noises, badly translated poop wisdom (which probably made it funnier), and a few photo ops. It culminates in a trip through the intestinal tract in which you throw some exercise balls over your head and back at your friends in a series of dark hallways. At the end, you go down a near vertical slide. The attraction ends in about 15 or 20 minutes. It's worth checking out, but don't have high hopes.", April 2017
30,5.0,It's a laugh,It's cheap to get in. You don't stay long. But it's a laugh. Some funny photo opportunities. The slide at the end is a thrill. They don't offer any lockers and we had a backpack each which was a pain to carry around. Kids under 5 not allowed., February 2017
31,5.0,5 Dollars Well Spent,"My friend and I were walking around Insadong, and literally followed little pictures of the pop emjoi on the floor/the sounds of farts into ""Poo Poo Land"". Most random, unexpected & hilarious place ever. This place is ridiculous and amazing. Seriously - just go. Most fun I have ever had at a ""museum"".", July 2016
32,4.0,Silly fun in Insadong,"This silly museum was close to our hotel in Insadong, hidden away in a shopping mall area. If you can't laugh at farting or feces then this is not the place for you. I wouldn't have known if existed if I hadn't found it on tripadvisor first. If you hate confined spaces in the dark then you won't enjoy your ""trip through the digestive system."" All and all it was an inexpensive giggle.", October 2016
33,5.0,Most fun ever ,So amazing!!! So much fun and light hearted well worth it. The slide was great at the end. Not too long but you have so much fun in a very bizarre but wonderful place! Kids would love and us two who are young at heart, November 2016
34,1.0,Bad experience!,"We bought tickets for poopoo land and dynamic maze, nowhere is it stated that kids 3 and under cant enter. And no where is its stated that kids under 130cm cant use the slide. Our kids is 3 and 5, and not old and big enough.", September 2016
35,4.0,Hilariously Fun,"This inexpensive museum is based on your imaginary experience traveling through the human body as, well, poo. That said, the whole museum is educational but also tongue-in-cheek. If you are easily offended or have a limited sense of humor, this museum is not for you.This museum features lots of interactive areas. You can climb through a rope maze, shimmy through soft cushy pads in the dark, and go down a 70-degree angle slide that shoots you out to a ""poo tree"" where you can tie your comments about the museum to its branches. There are lots of funny picture taking opportunities. The gift shop offers some fun poo-related souvenirs.This museum is hidden among one of alleys of Insadong, but well worth a visit if you're in for some fun and a laugh.", July 2016
