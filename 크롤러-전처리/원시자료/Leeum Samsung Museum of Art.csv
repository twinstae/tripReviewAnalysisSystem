0,5.0,Lights and mirrors!,"Lots of impressive eye candy in the form of lights and mirrors. The 3-D contemporary art is my favorite, and it delivered. The abstract expressionist stuff isn’t my thing, nor is the 12th century pottery. If you want semi-interactive 3-D art with a “wow” factor, this is the", February 2020
1,4.0,Good Korean Art Museum,Very modern and impresive museum. Audio guide is very precise and accurate. It shows mainly modern korean art and ancient ceramic pieces found in archeological excavations., January 2020
2,5.0,Well curated museum,This museum is worth a visit to get a nice mix of old and modern art. It's well curated without being overwhelming., January 2020
3,4.0,Private Art Museum - Mostly Contemporary,NO photos are allowed inside.  If  you enjoy more contemporary art then you would enjoy this site.  I do highly recommend the section on local Korean art and anceint relics.  If you enjoy art you will enjoy your visit., August 2019
4,5.0,Fascinating collection in an amazing space,"This place is a little off the beaten path and well worth the effort to get there.  You could spend an hour or a day here, seeing modern and contemporary art as well as traditional Korean art.  I especially appreciated the connections between the two, and between what's being done in Korea and other parts of the world.  Objects are really well displayed, with lots of space to see them.", November 2019
5,5.0,Good combination of both traditional Korean art & modern art,"In a very well designed building, in a hilly street in Itaewong, the Museum offers a good selection of traditional Korean art (potteries) as well as interesting modern art pieces.Easily my favourite museum in Seoul, and one of the best site overall.", November 2019
6,5.0,"Definitely worth the visit, especially the antiquities section! Definitely get the Audio guide!","American visiting Seoul for second time and wanted to experience antiquities and somewhat close to Seoul center. It’s a very professional and beautiful museum. Keep walking up the hill on the right, there is a sign that maybe misleading to have you turn left, but stay on right side of road, past parking garage, and open entrance with walkway of circles embedded in walkway that keep lighting up green numbers. After paying admission and picking up your ear piece audio guide, take elevator to 4th floor and work your way down through celadon, pottery, textiles, Buddhas, crowns and other artifacts. Some modern pieces here too and the spiral staircase with a beautiful work of glass art down the middle. There’s a gift shop, cafe and restrooms. Lovely museum! Very glad we went.", November 2019
7,4.0,Korean Art History and Contemporary Art in an exceptional space,"One day and a half in this wonderful city, so I choose quality over quantity and beeline for the Leeum Samsung Museum.  Here I settle in for two hours taking in exceptional examples of Korean porceline, calligraphy and metalworks which then set the stage for a leap into modern and contemporary visual art displays featuring icons including De Kooning, Brown, Giacometti and Rothko, while avoiding the crowds one finds at the National Museum of History and the National Museum of Contemporary Art. The rest of the day can be spent in a myriad of other sites in Seoul. I leave this museum saturated, satisfied and hopeful for another visit, another time and hopefully soon.", November 2019
8,4.0,Definitely Worth a Visit,"The museum is most impressive architecturally. It is divided into three sections (each called a “museum”, and each section comprised of two or three floors).  I personally was absolutely fascinated by the ceramics collection on the top floor of museum number 1.  Much less enjoyed the exhibits in the other two museums.  My companion on the other hand, highly enjoyed all three museums.", October 2019
9,5.0,Beautiful Modern Museum with great art collection,"Leeum is a beautiful modern building on its own.  When you add the art collection, it is truly a worthwhile visit.  Interesting juxtaposition of Korean artists against famous modern Western artists catalogs the evolution of modern art influence.", October 2019
10,5.0,Best museum in Seoul for modern art,"try to book an English tour on Friday - beautiful location and superior collection.  Small museum, you can go though all the exhibits in 2 hours.  Skip the museum cafe- go down the hill to Passion 5 for dessert.", October 2019
11,5.0,Worth a visit ,"This museum was in my guide book and since it was about 3 mins away from our hotel, we decided to visit.I did not pay for the audio set but at only an extra 1,000 won it is worth getting. The museum is split into 3 parts with one part being dedicated to artifacts from various dynasties. The second museum is modern art and the third part is what I will define as ultra modern art. I liked this museum and it housed a couple of Damien Hirst paintings and a Francis Bacon painting together with 3 or 4 Anish Kapoor pieces or art.There were also a couple of unique art installations one which you enter and its mirrored everywhere. Definitely worth a visit.", October 2019
12,5.0,A fantastic museum,"This is a manageable museum (you can cover a lot of ground in two hours here) that blends Korean history with modern art and works in between.  Great exhibits and a fantastic campus with killer architecture to supercharge your Instagram.  Also, around the museum is a v. cool area with trendy cafes and places to eat but not crazy expensive.", September 2019
13,5.0,Outstanding exhibit on Celadon as well as excellent modern art,We spent hours here and were glad we had the audio guide to help us along.We started on the top floor with the celadon and learned about its history while viewing national treasures.Later we thoroughly enjoyed the modern art collection . all in all a wonderful day!, September 2019
14,5.0,Contemporary art explained,Simple and attractive . Useful audio guide. Handy in manual mode.Good idea to ban photo: one can focus on the works.Ceramics section interesting but not for everyone., August 2019
15,5.0,"Short, sweet, and interesting: especially the modern parts","Allow for 2-3 hours to cover this cute museum. It's not too big, therefore not too tiring or overwhelming. It has three parts. The first, with traditional Korean artifacts: ceramics, caligraphy, etc. The second includes ""serious"" modern art, and the third (and the most fun) exhibits contemporary, young, sophisticated and clever art.We loved it. It's a museum that has something for everyone.", August 2019
16,5.0,Superb Collection,"While the collection is not enormous it is very high quality with works from virtually every noteworthy modern artist from the last hundred years. The audio guide (cheap at only one dollar) is excellent and covers every painting and sculpture. The collection is small enough that you can afford to devote some time with each piece and good enough that you'll want to. If you don't like modern art, then this may not be the museum for you.  The building is also stunning and at $10 its pretty cheap. So if you like modern art, or are curious and want to learn, then you could hardly do better than this wonderfull gallery!", August 2019
17,1.0,Terrible- pretentious,"If you are not in great shape or got the money for a taxi ride up the hill, don't even think of visiting.A perfect zero score for the management who didn't think about accessability - even the audio guides cannot be adjusted properly.", August 2019
18,2.0,Great architecture but so boring exhibitions,"Maybe we expected just too much because we were so disappointed. Expensive and there's nothing special to see even we walked through all museums. Most interesting is building itself, outside and inside.", July 2019
19,5.0,Delightful and esthetic experience,"A beutifully designed art museum, containing both a section of modern, contemporary art and one with classic Korean art. One of the best art museums I have visited. The museum, slightly tucked away from the main street is superbly designed and every item in the museum has plenty of space and is exhibited with outmost respect. It is delightful to walk around and watch modern classic western art mixed with modern Korean art. And for a European, just fantastic to see new artists and new motifs, rarely on show in Europe. If interested in art, in my view a must see. If not for the paintings then at least for the design of the museum.", July 2019
20,5.0,World class architects and art objects meet high tech,"These amazing buildings, 2 of the 3 of which are exhibition spaces, have state of the art tech which allows a closer view of the object on one’s loaned Samsung phone as well as more information about the object. No need to input a number for the object - the phone senses when you are in front and tells you about that object until you move on. Priceless porcelains including celadon and antique objects mixed with a few contemporary art works gives context to the old. How about a dark Rothko painting next to a few hundred years old artifact?  A steel Anish Kapolei sculpture? You get the point.", June 2019
21,5.0,Fabulous museum,"It’s like 3 museums in one.  Leeum Samsung is divided into 3 sections, each of which was designed by a different architect (definitely watch the film in which they describe the intent of their design).  The spaces are unique and well used.  The art collection is nothing short of amazing.  A very high tech audio tour is available - definitely pay the extra.  It is well worth the money.  One of the best and most interesting museums I’ve ever visited.", May 2019
22,2.0,Ridiculous rules,"I was really excited after seeing many positive reviews, even despite having to pay 10$ for a ticket - eg. Korean National Museum is free. But most of the work was old ceramics, not really what I wanted to see. There are a few great pieces and I love the architecture but I wasn’t even able to take a picture of anything. I experienced this for the first time. Usually you can’t take pictures with a flash, and I totally understand that. But here, you can’t take ANY picture. Plus, an alarm rings every time you get too close to the painting. As if guards each step you go weren’t enough. Unless they have a painting you really want to see and pay for that, I advise you not to go. I really don’t understand why this museum has so many good reviews.", May 2019
23,5.0,Outstanding museum; don't miss it,"If you are interested in art, do not miss this museum. Beautiful collection of Korean art, and the building itself is quite beautiful.", May 2019
24,5.0,outstanding museum.,"this museum is worth 3-4 hours, with a break in the cafe. the collection of celadon pottery is breathtaking. in addition there is a wonderful contemporary collection.", April 2019
25,5.0,Excellent architecture and wonderful collection,"Housed in ultra-modern architecture by Mario Botta, Jean Nouvel and Rem Koolhaas houses collections of old  and contemporary Korean art as well as international modern art. Definitely must see for architecture and art lovers.", April 2019
26,5.0,very interesting modern art museum,"It was designed by 3 architects, one of them being Jean Nouvel. We visited 2 of the buildings. The exhibitions were beautiful. But no photos were permitted.The neighbourhood in which the museum is located is also very interesting to visit by food with a lot of creatively designed shops and residentially houses.", January 2019
27,5.0,World-class Private Museum with Complete Sensoric Experience,"It is located around the Namsan area and the surroundings of the museum is picturesque with well-considered landscaping that can be seen from the inside of the museum. It is as though the exterior is part of the modern art installation. The best part of the learning journey was the Audio Guide which is a Samsung handheld device with a hook-on ear-piece which is way better than eat-pod types in terms of hygiene. The device operates on blue-tooth and will be activated at each exhibit Automatically. The curator’s rendition of each art work is meticulously crafted in a precise and concise manner that triggers our curiosity of each art work. If you prefer to read, the written version stored on the device is easily accessed. While the written and spoken form do not correspond word-for-word, the essence is captured similarly. There are 2 museums - Museum 1 focuses on Korean art historically, mainly Celadon Ink paintings and Calligraphy. The details captured in the audio guide feeds the mind and it is as though from one exhibit to the next, the storytelling is integrated as one whole. Museum 2 focuses on Modern Art by Korean artists and artists from different parts of the world. It has a great balance of variety from installations to fine art, paintings and art forms that might not mean much to the viewer except for visual and aesthetic appeals. But once the audio guide is tuned in, our minds start to sponge up the incredible meaning behind each creation including art trends, artists’ developments and societal influences...which speaks volumes into the depth of research and understanding of each art investment. We spent a total of 4 hours and it was time well invested! We lap it all up and hope that more people will enjoy this too! My son is a teen and he was totally intrigued - no WhatsApp nor IG during those fulfilling hours of discovery. Thank you Leeum Samsung!  Kudos to the Curators and Writers.", December 2018
28,4.0,Architecture and Art,Great museum for modern art.  Also exhibit of traditional Korean pottery.  Interesting architecture combining three different buildings.  Good views from grounds., November 2018
29,4.0,Great setting,Enjoyed the modern art at the Leeum Samsung museum.  The architecture is well done.  Loved the outside sculpture garden.  Great neighborhood to walk around afterwards.  Enjoyed the audio tape., November 2018
30,4.0,Interesting museum,"If you enjoy art, this museum is nice. It has two sections, traditional art which was mostly ancient Korean pottery, and a modern art section which is mostly paintings. It is not a very large museum and the pieces are quite spread out so unless you really enjoy taking time at each piece you can go through quite quickly. Just note you are not allowed to take photos here. At the time we visited the entry fee was 10,000 won.", November 2018
31,5.0,Worth the trip to Seoul!,"Very nice buildings, excellent collection, quiet and in a nice, lively and arty neighborhood with fancy shops", November 2018
32,5.0,Modern art museum,The landmark is the big silver ball sculpture in front of the museum. you have to walk about 15 minutes from Hangangjin Station., April 2018
33,3.0,"Not very much to see, but it's Samsung",So Samsung makes smartphones and has its own museums.This one is not about tech though. It has a wide variety of artifacts including ancient ones. Drop by here if you want to feel less guilty about spending all time only drinking in Itaewon. Walking distance from there., October 2018
34,5.0,A gem of a museum,This museum is stunning. Exquisite works are beautifully displayed in a wonderful setting.  Do not miss out! It is easily accessible by the Seoul subway., October 2018
35,4.0,Modern Art,"A perfect retreat for a rainy day in Seoul, I got free entry with the Discover Seoul pass. Many interesting pieces on display, perhaps most striking is Anish Kapoor's signature metallic bubbles in the garden. Photography policy is abit confusing, at the entrance is says no photo's yet plenty of people were happily snapping away on mobile phones, whilst others were told off. Some European visitors were speaking loudly inside and staff did nothing to quieten them.", October 2018
36,4.0,Best museum trip we had in Korea,"A friend took us to Leeum and we had no expectations. The two museums were equally beautiful. I specially enjoyed learning about modern Korean artists and the old earthenware collection. However our favorite part was the audio guide, which would automatically play files that corresponded with the artwork you were standing in front of. The museum is owned by the Samsung family, of course the technological interventions had to be there. I highly recommend this place, for it's architecture and what it holds.", September 2018
37,5.0,Breathtakingly beautiful ,Stunning museum. The architecture is splendid. The modern interpretation of a spiral cathedral-like staircase a highlight. The light entering modern museum number two. Collection small but perfectly formed. Highlight for us were the 4th floor museum number one - celadon pieces., August 2018
38,5.0,just wonderful,modern building for ancien art and collections of impressive pieces (you see the difference compared to some museum) . noticeable art section with the well known korean artists., September 2017
39,5.0,Modern art of Korea in a beautiful building ,"This gallery was a real treasure to find. The modern art work was just beautiful. Please note that the “spider” is not at the gallery anymore, although it is still on the website. Plenty of other great works to view in an amazing building. Very pleasant afternoon viewing.", August 2018
40,5.0,Digital Guide is really good,"Love museum 2:Beyond Sapce more than 1:Beyond Time, One of my favorite art at Public zone is ''Olafur Eliasson''Digital guide is really useful, and the rental cost 1,000won, quite cheap.", July 2018
41,5.0,Terrific Museum,We loved this museum. It has terrific exhibits. For $1 you can get an audio tour that is excellent. The gift shop has gorgeous items. The neighborhood has many good restaurants too., July 2018
42,5.0,Lovely museum,"This somewhat small museum is beautifully put together.  The building itself is an art piece containing ancient and abstract pieces.  At one point, a Rothko appears in the middle of ancient pottery, but it works.  There is a spectacular infinity room and other novel modern works.  If you have a free afternoon, this is worth a visit.", July 2018
43,1.0,Boring and abstract,"They are 3 places that are cool from in museum and that people take pictures of, the rest is just totally boring.The entrance fee is 10k Won. There are 2 expositions, one is about Korean art history and the other one about abstract. The first one is just so old pottery and old drawings. Not much to see, nothing really astonishing nor creative. The second one is abstract art which is an elegant word for laziness art. Many unknown foreign artists there, probably because they are too bad to be featured anywhere else.Please go to the D museum, much more alive, it's 15min away", July 2018
44,3.0,Samsung museum,For me it was boring. I have visited lots of museums and some of them were awesome and interesting and some of them were boring and not so interesting. Some of exhibits were really interesting and unusual. But generally it was like average. In this museum was absolutely quiet. I would give for this museum like 2 stars and half., February 2018
45,5.0,One museum not to miss,"Owned by the Samsung dynasty, it has more artefacts than of the national museum. From ancient Korea to contemporary art from this vibrant country, all in a beautiful building which is a work in art by itself. Recommended.", July 2018
46,4.0,Wonderful Collection of Art,"It was raining so we decided to take a museum tour, this is one of the stop, wonderful outstanding collections, can easily spend few hour here, because our time was limited, maybe the next time come here by ourselves to really explore.", June 2018
47,5.0,Great contrast of moden and ancient art,I highly recommend getting the audio headset which is very inexpensive compared to other museums and adds a lot more context to the tight descriptions on display. Good variety in the collection with a bit over balance on pottery and ceramics. The structure itself is breathtaking and overall worth a 2 hour visit. I suggest skimming through the areas to focus on those that are more suited to one's interests as the collection is quite large., February 2018
48,5.0,Musea,"We visit this museum and were surprises. For the beginning , the architectuur of the building is wunderfull.There are 2 musea inside and sometime even a third exposition.We liked the modern museum as most.The fee is 10.000 won. Are you older dan 65 than 5000 won.We recommend", May 2018
49,5.0,fabulous museum,"very well curated with explanation in English, great exhibits (dont miss the shipwreck rooms): a must when in Seoul", February 2018
50,3.0,Quite ordinary,It has an interesting outdoor art piece comprising metal balls and an interesting internal staircase. There are numerous art pieces on display with some impressive ones. There is a fairly long walk (up a slope) from the nearest metro station; a surprise is a huge dog statue at the bottom of the slope but it is not part of the museum. The museum may suit someone with an interest in Korean art., April 2018
51,4.0,Great contemporary art!,Good traditional korean art. But I prefer the part of Contemporary Art. Interesting and fun! Should go once.Remark : No photo inside, April 2018
52,5.0,Mesmerizing,"In the middle of bustling Itaewon, the Leeum Samsung Museum of Art carves out a quiet respite from the city. There are a few large outdoor modern sculptures that you can photograph. These are also the only works in the museum that you're allowed to photograph.The walkway entrance to the museum immediately puts the visitor into a calm and tranquil state prior to passing through the doors. The traditional and ancient art, paintings, celadon vessels of Korea are located from the 4th floor down. They've kept the lighting very dim in the galleries to better highlight the exhibits. There is also a gallery of modern art on one side of the building that is a total contrast to the traditional galleries. These are vibrant, interesting and occasionally a little disturbing.I would recommend the audio guide as it provides greater details of the traditional exhibits. What's cool is you don't even need to touch the audio guide. It operates through Bluetooth and as you approach an exhibit case, the guide will automatically start to describe the exhibit you are in front of. I spent a few delightful hours here ... and then later walked down to a cute bakery, the Glamorous Penguin for coffee and cake.", April 2018
53,5.0,Architecture and Art,"Well designed building housing some national treasures(porcelain) as well as some fabulous modern art. The central staircase reminds one of the Guggenheim in New York, the art is very well dispersed allowing one plenty of time to move for new views without being hindered by other museum goers.", May 2018
54,4.0,Mr. ,"Nicely organized, not big, good for a 2hr visit. Not very crowded. Within walking distance to the Grand Hyatt Hotel.", May 2018
55,5.0,Art appreciation of contemporary Korean and international art,"Leeum is a beautiful exhibition space where modern and contemporary art meets. It is home to leading works of Korean art from as early as  1910 and onwards, along with important examples of international art since 1945. The international art collection is impressive. The extensive collection ranges from the works of such pioneers in modern Western art such as Alberto Giacometti, Francis Bacon, Mark Rothko, Joseph Beuys, and Andy Warhol to established contemporary artists, including Damien Hirst, Jeff Koons, and Andreas Gursky. In addition, a growing number of works by non-Western artists within the collection reflects the dynamic and multi-centered nature of contemporary art. There is locker  facilities to store your baggage and headsets can be rented for only a ￦1000. The headset automatically detects the artworks and starts to play a very informative soundclip. I would recommend that you do this for a more educational and enriching experience. The museum has a lovely coffee café and gift shop.  Leeum's gift store is filled with inspiring gifts and a wide assortment of products reflecting the museum’s extraordinary collection and special exhibitions. Here you can find some stunning souvenirs to take home with you.", April 2018
56,4.0,modern with a distinct Korean touch to  it!,"if you are taking the train, the nearest station is through the Itaewon station.Then another 10-15minutes walk through the main road and up a hill to where the museum is conveniently located.  Very easy to find since there are signs and you can always ask around.The museum showcases great Korean national treasures and you can;t help but be in awe of how the government and this private company has gone through lengths of preserving such treasures.  Beautifully preserved and well-curated.There are some temporary art installations as well at the lobby and some select galleries.What excited me the most of Anish Kapoor's permanent installation ""Cloudgate"" right outside the museum yard.  Great location for a photo op!My second time to visit this museum and is always a pleasant one every time.", May 2017
57,5.0,Great Art Museum,"The Leeum Art Museum in Seoul is a manageable private art museum with three levels inside and an outside sculpture garden.  Audio phones in many languages allow one to have a private tour at ones own pace.  From ancient to modern art this private collection is informative, educational, entertaining, and thoroughly enjoyable.  I took two hours on a Sunday to leisurely tour the entire museum.  It cost about $9 USD. Plus $10 for the audio phone. Well worth the price.", April 2018
58,3.0,Ok,"Amazing architecture.   Not necessarily my favorite style of art, but the collection was ok.   Good collection of ancient ceramics.", April 2018
59,4.0,A must go place,Went there with two friends and I must say it is among one of the best places I visited in Seoul. You won't regret it!, October 2017
60,4.0,Stunning art museum ,"The museum itself is already a masterpiece you don't have to admire anything else. Entrance fee is at 10000 Korean won for both permanent exhibitions. The first exhibitions are all chinaware/bronze ware displays, calligraphy and Buddha statues. The second exhibitions are for modern / contemporary arts, which I love. There is also a little outdoor garden with a few pieces. Great to spend an hour or 2.", March 2018
61,5.0,Samsung does it like no other!,"Beside having a very impressive collection of ceramics, the museum also has a built in sensors for your listening guide.  I was grateful that all I had to do is stand by the display to have the audio device automatically start talking about it.  No need to plug in numbers or go in a specific manner.  A marvelous museum in all areas.", February 2018
62,4.0,World Class and Sunning - too sad no photos,"This is certainly a world class museum with the most spectacular and thought provoking collection of art. The audio tour is also excellent and highly recommended. It is sensor activated and does not require selections. Museum essentially in two parts: art and ceramics.The art is of more interest to me. A few of the works worthy of comment. Three floors to visit. Richard Prince - monogramstic jokes with texts. Not really so humorous and lacks artistic value. Jean- Michel Basquiat - black Centres but not altogether flowing as art should. Celebrates black sports persons but a little disjointed in expression. British artist Antony Gormley's exhibit 'feeling material' a hanging circular metallic expression gives perspectives in spatial dimensions. Japanese Neo-pop depicted by Takashi Murakami. Stunning colourful expression a cross between pop and animated art. Large colourful and embracing. An artist with great vision and ability. Hiroshi Sugimoto portrayal of the interior of a 1920's cinema is amazing, it captures in gray scales - though essentially in black and white the ornate and artistic nature of the theatre itself. By using a slow shutter to emphasis the ornateness of the building, a whiteout of the screen places a twist of emphasis from the film to the cinema. Great artistic manipulation by the photographer. Yang Haegue a Korean artist using the interior of security envelopes with mosaics to prevent the interior from being seen. The application is stunning and the end product simply fascinating. It is not clear how the said parts are merged as there are a lack of seams between the various security patterns. Then by Damien Hirst is the beauty of the butterfly. In the collage of butterfly wings, made to resemble a stained glass window. It typifies a quote of Hirst Who once remarked that a butterfly was on only living thing to look as good in death as in life. Lim Ok-Sang has a dramatic artwork depicting the Minjung Art movement. It depicts the tranquility of rural Chonju but depicts a dramatic and fierce bird in the sky representing military oppression, that can destabilise the serenity below. Excellent representation. Ice block replication on the upper level is interesting.I viewed the Celedon but my experience is insufficient to comment. Interesting to see crowns from earlier dynasties and royal attire.Well worth a visit. Too bad no photography. All items are listed in the museum catalogue in two parts at a cost of W100 000 - for both. Nice cafe with nice artistic decor also. Take a look at the sculptures outside also.", March 2018
63,5.0,The best museum of Seoul,"This is the best museum of Seoul.  They have old Korean china of ages.  If you want to known the history of Korean china, you should visit here", April 2017
64,4.0,Leeum Samsung Museum of Art,"Samsung Museum is very nice place for people who are interested in arts. It is possible to visit two different sections, one on traditional arts and second on contemporary arts. Location is easily accessible. Audio guide is available. Entrance fee is reasonable. Especially contemporary arts section has interesting artistic creatures from both Korean and non-Korean artists.", February 2018
65,5.0,World class in every way.,"Originally funded by the Samsung heir family, the museum is a collection of three buildings designed by internationally-renowned architects.  Located along the hilly street in posh Itaewon, Rem Koolhaas designed the Temporary Exhibitions musem which features interesting exhibitions several times a year.  Adjacent to the outdoor sculpture garden is a two storey structure designed by Jean Nouvel housing the modern arts permanent collection.  Tucked in back in terra cotta cladding is a Mario Botta designed pavilion housing Korean antiquity.  All of the permanent collections are substantial in their own right and worth a visit.  Cleverly connected at the entrance via a vast underground lobby, the facility is modern and tryuly world class.", February 2018
66,5.0,Modernity,"Great sculptures out in the yards, interesting exhibits inside, permanent as well as rotating. Easily accessible but up a hill from Itaewon.", January 2018
67,5.0,Great Museum and grounds,Spectacular collection of all of the Greats in Contemporary art.There is also charming exhibitions of Korean antiquities., April 2017
68,5.0,Underrated museums ,The details of this museum are very unique. Since it is the Samsung museum you get the options having a samsung audio guide which was a really interesting museum experience. over all the artifacts are very old and different from what I was used to in the states so I would most definitely recommend for people who are interested in design and architecture and art of facts of history as well. Also the installation and from Rem Koolhaas architecture of the building is worth to check out., July 2017
69,3.0,Great place to visit only if you're an architect or museum lovers,"We went to visit the museum since my husband is an architect. The building is really nice & has an architectural essence that would definitely attract those with an eye of perfectionist and into art. There are 2 exhibition halls to visit. We were too tired to go to all so we just ended up visiting one hall. There were lots to see if you have the time. Our advise is if you want to visit the museum, get there by car since there were a lot of walking uphill & narrow lanes...very near to the Namsan Trekking Trail.", December 2017
70,5.0,A Cultural Gem,A must visit when in Seoul. Artwork ranges from Modern to thousands of years old. This museum is a cross between the Museum of Natural History and the Whitney. Great outdoor space too., December 2016
71,3.0,"Six of One, Half Dozen of Another.","On the last Wednesday of the month they have half price admission. Which is the price that this gallery should be normally. We were impressed by the ceramics exhibit and some of the great modern art on display. Of particular interest was the piece by Paik Nam June an incredibly underrated Korean artist. One of the few Korean artists that was a true genius and not derivative.On the other hand we expected more from a gallery that is sponsored by Samsung a multi billion dollar company. Parts of the long spiral staircase very clearly needed cleaning or new paint. Instead of all the uniformed staff who were standing and not doing much, they should hire more cleaners. Another small complaint about the ceramics and metal collection was that original items and reproductions were not clearly distinguished. All in all it's worth a visit and we were very impressed that the front security guard opened our taxi door for us and greeted us warmly.", November 2017
72,5.0,I’ll Join the Supporter’s League,"I’ll make it short and sweet. I agree with virtually all the positive remarks I’ve read. Love the architecture, the collections, the flow of the place, the scale of the place and was not put off by the “no photography” rule nor did I find the staff rude or offensive. (However, neither did I find them to be especially friendly, but that’s okay. I wasn’t at the museum to socialize.)Highly recommended, and for me, I’m ready to go back for a third time!", November 2017
73,5.0,Loved this place!,"This is a really fantastic museum and a bit of a hidden gem, some of the Korean's I was working with hadn't heard of it. The Museum is split into two sections, contemporary art from International and Korean artists and also Ancient art and lots of ceramics from the Ceylon period. All of it beautiful and interesting. It's curated really well, and the flow of the space is excellent. Other reviews have mentioned the interactive hands free headset. It's definitely worth getting it for the extra 1000W. It activates by itself when you move to a piece that you are interested in and gives a short but helpful amount of info. Very clever. A must visit if you are an art lover.", October 2017
74,5.0,Relaxing Museum with a great collection,"I spent a couple hours exploring this wonderful museum in Hannam-dong, I took the subway to Hanganjin and it was a mere 15 minute walk away. The museum has an impressive collection of contemporary art from artists around the world and Korean artists in one area and in another area a historic collection of wares and paintings from a bygone era of Korean history. I was so excited to find an Alberto Giacometti that I set off the little alarm warning I was too close to the painting. After a week of battling with other tourists at tourist hot spots, this museum was a welcome relief to the weary mind. The cafe also made a fantastic coffee and served pretty good cake too. If you visit I recommend that you pay the 1000 won for the digital guide which works when you stand in front of an exhibit, giving you the low down of the artist and the thought process behind a piece of work.", October 2017
75,5.0,Very very nice museum,"This museum is made up of 3 interesting buildings each designed by a different architect. There are two galleries, one is a modern art exhibition and the other is Korean. Both are very good. The architecture is fantastic. The outside has a few interesting pieces.The surrounding neighborhood is very upscale with interesting and modern villas all around. Definitely worth a visit.", October 2017
76,5.0,Perfectly sized and designed museum ,Set in quiet location in a trendy neighbourhood the museum building designed by world renowned architects is fascinating. I liked most the museum 1 building both in terms of architecture as well as collection. The audio guide which works automatically when you approach a piece of the collection is a must. You start at the 4th floor and then walk down. The ceramics collection is outstanding. In museum 2 I liked Damien Hirst's work best. Definitely worth a visit!, September 2017
77,5.0,Great Museum - Get the Audio!,"Visited on one of our last days here...not my favourite district but worth visiting for the gallery.As you'd expect from Samsung, this gallery is super modern, great architecture and great media guides. Before you pay to get into the museum, there are outdoor works you can visit. We saw a couple of Anish Kapoor pieces before escaping the sun.The museum is split into a few different sections - traditional works focusing on ancient Buddhist pieces and ceylon pottery before moving into the modern/contemporary pieces. Some well known international artists (Eliasson installation is pretty cool!) but particularly enjoyed the Korean artists on show.The media guides start automatically when you stand in front of certain pieces and go into just enough detail without being boring. Skipped a few towards the end as realised it is very easy to spend hours here.  Only negative is that moving around a bit can affect the guide and for some pieces it didn't play automatically (very easy to get used to not having to push an buttons!) Definitely pay the extra for the guide! We weren't going to take them but after the staff recommended them, we were glad we did. They are pretty cool and explain everything in a nice, informative way :)", May 2017
78,3.0,Great architecture,A bit of a walk form metro stop. We were a bit disappointed by the works on display consisting of traditional art works and modern art. Spent under an hour here, July 2017
79,4.0,Three experiences in one,This is a lovely way to spend a couple of hours on a dry day so you can take advantage of the outdoor art park that includes some large sculptures. Indoors you will find there are two separate collections: one traditional and one contemporary. The traditional art is a great collection of celadon displayed to best advantage with direct lighting and muted backgrounds and some modern canvases to offset. The Modern collection is from 1910 onward and while not a huge fan of this kind of art; there are some very significant works here. There was enough whimsy throughout the collection to make it endearing and enjoyable. Staff was professional and no different from any other museum staff in the hundreds of museums I have visited over the years.A word of caution: there is a wonderful interactive room; absolutely a must-see:just mind your head on the way out as the sign says., July 2017
80,3.0,nicely done small museum,"Small-ish collection, but some great pieces. Lovely building and well set out for easy self-guided tour.Even though it perhaps costs a little more on a strict collection size to price ratio than some other galleries and museums in Seoul, I don't think you can grumble over the ticket price given some of the world class art and artifacts on display.", July 2017
81,4.0,Hi Tech,Museum visit can be a lot fun.. has so many beautiful collections and love the way it deliver the information of each item through audio sensorIt also has many attractive photo spots, August 2016
82,2.0,"Beautiful Pieces, Subpar museum.","Leeum Museum has a beautiful collection, including Damien Hirst, Basquiat, Paik Nam June etc. However, the staff really made the entire experience unenjoyable. They hovered around, seemed very suspicious of the guests and monitored you wherever you went. The proximity sensors in front of many pieces were far too sensitive, and very loud and shrill. I was constantly disrupted by the alarms sounding by someone passing by a painting ""too closely"". The museum is also very harsh on its ""no photography"" policy (that resulted in the staff staring closely whenever you took out your phone) which I dislike but others may be fine with. I would still say go for the art, but try to ignore everything else that's going on.", July 2017
83,5.0,Beautifully presented,This was a peaceful and beautiful museum. Well-presented and explained. They also had a very nice shop., April 2017
84,2.0,Impressive exhibition of ancient and modern art.....flawed by awful staff,"I truly enjoyed the exhibitions. My favourite was the Basquiat piece they had on display. I didn't care much about the staff, other than a few of them basically following me everywhere I went. It was as if the intention was to make me feel uncomfortable. I was there for the art, nothing else, however they might want to rethink their way of dealing with art-lovers from other parts of the world. It's a place where people appreciate human expression, in its purest artistic form, rather than be constantly reminded of human insecurity and fear of the other. I asked to write a comment about my experience and was given a sticky note, which I'm sure was thrown away soon after. Unfortunate", June 2017
85,1.0,Experience of Korea bling bling : money money money ,"The service was horrible - no smile, all the staff on their phones and when I went to the coffee after visiting the museum for a  piece of cake (which I paid) , I asked for a glass of water and the waiter told me : ""here you can get water only if you pay"" ! I was a bit shocked so I asked at the front desk if I can have just a glass of tab water and they told me ""No""It was canicule outside and I felt very bad For a museum which pretends to show what is Korean culture it is quite on the edge. It shows a culture without any respect neither politeness. I did not see that anywhere else either in other museums of Seoul, or anywhere else in the world to make people pay for tabwater. For a pretended national institution it is rather a national shame", June 2017
86,5.0,An excellent museum in a beautiful part of town,"I always visit art museums when I'm visiting any foreign city. The Leeum Samsung Museum of Art is a must see for anyone who likes are, and beautiful modern museums. The museum has collections of modern and historical art; I only visited the modern wing because that's how I roll.", June 2017
87,4.0,Small but exquisite collection,"The collection of Korean ceramics, paintings, and bronzes is beautiful. They are displayed in the circular floor-plan building and are very well presented and described. The collection is not large and even if you read everything, it is not more than about an hour's visit (for a pricey KRW 10,000). The contemporary art part of the museum is smaller.This is not the easiest museum to access in Seoul and is a bit removed from other attractions. It is in the Itaewon area, which is a somewhat gritty street with souveneir shops, galleries, bars, and restaurants.", June 2017
88,4.0,Nice One,"It was a nice place to discover modern art. although it is quite far from the other attractions, it was worth going to.", January 2017
89,1.0,Worst experience to a museum,"At one glance from the outside, the architecture and design was stunning and could appeal to the visitors. However, the turn off was the inside, where the lack service from the staff on site couldn't make up for the efforts they put into the arts on display. Staff was unfriendly and lazy, at times playing with their phones. Even though a museum is not a place to impress visitors in services, but no smiles on the faces of staff when they see us makes visitors uncomfortable and unable to enjoy the experience. Not worthy of even a penny.", May 2017
90,5.0,Stunning collection,"The historical part has a spectacular scenography, and we contemporary part displays a very interesting masterpiece of great artist. You should count 3 hour for the visit.", May 2017
91,2.0,Not interesting. Absolutely poor museum.,"Looking from the outside I really can't wait to get into this museum as I expected to see something special there. Not interesting. Absolutely poor museum. Really disappointing. Now, after the visit, I wish I staid away and save time and money because it was lost.", May 2017
92,5.0,The unbelievable experience,"By looking at the outside, you feel you want to go in and have a look at it. I was with my mom to visit this place with the hired private tour guide. I spent almost 4 hours to visit several levels of museum and also an extraordinary work by a special guest of artist. If you are the art, history and inspirational fond personnel, you do not want to miss this place as it is a worth to visit here. You can have a cuppa and break in a cafe that is residing inside of this place. A beautiful place that you tend to know the history of arts immediately and please wear proper clothes without slippers or shorts or mini skirts. I mean you might be allowed to enter but it is like a grand oscar place that you could not see it from the outside but the inside. The historical items that truly making you an eye opener and there are a souvenir corner that you might want to get for yourself or as a gift to friends and family.The extra ordinary art piece which I need to pay another sum to visit truly worth! I even watched Rainbow Rain in a Dark room!!!! I felt privileged!!!", December 2016
93,4.0,Great Architeture,"Even if you're not into modern art, the museum's architecture is worth the visit and before or after the visit you can walk around the neighborhood that surrounds the museum. Is a very modern part of the city with great restaurants.", April 2017
94,4.0,Leeum,"Museum is kinda small than it seems. Entrance is 10,000 wons...some nice pictures can be taken outside the museum. Nice location close to Itaewon. Modern art section is pretty good", April 2017
95,5.0,Insightful tours really complement this well laid out art museum.,"Despite being in Seoul a few times already, this was the first time I made the track to Leeum. This is definitely one I regret not going to earlier.The museum is split into two permanent exhibitions: Beyond Time, which houses historical art, and Beyond Space, housing contemporary art. Beyond Time focuses quite a bit on traditional Korean pottery (showcasing some Buddhist and Confucian elements). Unless you have a tour, I’d highly recommend getting an audio guide to truly appreciate the story/technique behind the historical art. There are also special exhibitions from time to time (check their website).I highly recommend the docent tours. Our English docent tour was lead by by Soyean, who was friendly, extremely knowledgeable, and had a great command of English to be able to explain things/field questions well.Make sure to take a step outside and admire the building and the decks, which itself feels like a work of art. In the sculpture garden you’ll find works from Anish Kapoor, who sculpted the Bean in Chicago.Will definitely be brining friends around next time I’m in town and there’s a special exhibition.P.S. No pictures allowed.", April 2017
96,5.0,Samll place,"This a museum of modern art, so if you enjoy a more realistic style, this isn't for you.Took the subway and then walked about 10-15 minutes to get here. Hangangin station I believe, exit 10. Once you get outside follow the signs, turn right and head up a steeper road/hill. Museum is on the right hand side.Korean Museum so emphasis is on Korean pieces, two main galleries, one is international and one is Korean. A great deal of traditional Korean Pottery which is very nice. I rented the audio guide for 1000won, well worth it. It tends to work on automatic, as you near a piece it will start telling you about it, though sometimes, you may need to remind it where you are.Small place so, you'll need maybe two hours depending on your interest and speed. Nice way to spend part of an afternoon.", April 2017
97,4.0,Amazing Architeture and Exhibition,"It was a cold day in Seoul (minus degrees) and the 4 of us decided to take the taxi from Myeongdong to the Leeum Samsung museum.  The fare was fairly reasonable and is less than 5000 won (US$4.15) and we were there in about 15 minutes.   please note, it is not required to tip taxi driver in Seoul.  We walk up a small slope upto the beautiful modern architecture.  There is a huge outdoor space that offers a full view of the building and be prepare to take a lot of photos.  There are 2 exhibition hall, one permanent collection and one for the current exhibitions.  We bought the day pass for 17000 won (US$14).   The permanent collection has a few floors with Korean and International art pieces which is good.  The current exhibit is Olafur Eliasson which is really amazing and my favourite is the  rainbow assembly.  Although the mu", November 2016
98,5.0,Amazing collection,"The Leeum (Samsung Museum) itself is a work of art, with architecture by Rem Koolhaus, Mario Botta and Jean Nouvel. It is much larger than I realized, so I saw the complete modern and contemporary collection, but only scratched the surface of the tradional museum. You should allow 3  hours to see everything. The modern and contemporary museum is a beautifully curated. Among many others, it houses pieces by Korean artists Lee Joong-seop, Park Soo-keum and Nam Jun Paiik, and Western artists Damien Hirst, Cindy Sherman, Louise Bourgeois, Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko. Make sure you rent the Digital Guide, a hand-held device that provides high-resolution images and information for all the works of art. As you approach a work of art, the device automatically recognizes and briefly explains each of the works on display. If you want more information, you can simply click on the image to learn more about the artist and the work.", March 2017
99,4.0,Hints on this place,"1) Museum is not so big as it seems. Admission is 10000 won2) Open 10:30–18:00. Usually it's closed on Mondays3) Buildings and space around the museum are one of the main things to look at4) Children are welcome! Koreans love children, so don't be afraid if your kid is loud5) Small and quite expensive cafe, good shop full of stuff made by designers and artists, clean WC, elevators", March 2017
100,4.0,Leeum Samsung Museum of Art,"The museum has two houses, Korean traditional objects are being exhibited in museum 1, while museum 2 is dedicated to modern and contemporary arts. There are quite a few pieces in museum 1 being listed under ""Treasure"" and ""National Treasure"" categories. The museum is situated in a quaint quarter of Seoul. Even if one chooses not to visit the museum, it is nice to walk around and appreciate the nice surroundings in the neighbourhood.  Entrance fee to the museum is 10,000 wons. To get there, simply get off at Hangangjin subway station exit 1 and follow the signs for a few minutes' walk to the museum.", March 2017
101,3.0,Third time,"This is my 3rd time here in 3 years, and probably lastThe 2 permanent exhibitions are always the  same and the temporary exhbibits are few and far in between. I enjoy the rothko, giocometti, hitst, warhol, de kooning et al, but they are always the same ones. I think they bought a new murakami, which is niceThe other thing i don't like is they don't let you take pictures. And they have a dozen staff on each floor to stop you", February 2017
102,1.0,Avoid at all cost,"Unfriendly and too few staff that results in a tense and chaotic atmosphere. Inefficient layout, stuffy air, bad curating and ridiculously expensive. Even if I try really hard I can barely find any good attributes about this place - but then again, all opinions are subjective. I guess you could say that the surrounding area is quite pleasant; I felt much more positive and engaged while walking around than I've ever felt inside this 'museum'. Too commercial, flooded with local doing everything to get the best angle for their selfies, instead of looking at the works. This place managed to make even Olafur Eliasson's works bad.", February 2017
103,5.0,Lovely museum; good for a cold day,We visited in Winter. It was a excellent activity. Guides were friendly. We even had free entry as we were willing to participate in a survey, February 2017
104,4.0,Interesting ,"The museum is split into three: contemporary, Korean and visiting exhibitions (additional cost). The Korean covers pottery, buddhist artifacts and paintings, all of which are very well presented and sourced. The contemporary is a mix of western and Korean artists, mainly Abstract. Close to some Rothkos is a blank black wall which was attracting interest until they realised it was just an empty wall; summed up Abstract art quite succinctly. The Bacon is quite wonderful though. The buildings are interesting in themselves too.", February 2017
105,5.0,Best museum in Korea ~ hands down,Really solid special and permanent exhibits. Impressive. Free day pass for foreigners today (fill out a survey for free admission ~ drop off the survey on your way out) Museums here can be big and underwhelming- not the case at Leeum. Global collection/ staff is friendly/near the Grand Hyatt hotel, February 2017
106,5.0,Olafur Eliasson Exhibition,"Metro line 6 - Stn Hangangjin, exit 1. Walk straight out from the exit and soon you will see signs for the museum. It is about 300m total. Currently they have a special exhibition by Olafur Eliasson called ""The Parliament of Possibilities"". I am not normally a modern art lover, but the wife dragged me in and I love it. His mix of engineering and design with his pieces, I just found fascinating. Pitty there are only 2 floors of his art. The rest of the museum is so so, a few good pieces and a lot of pieces I have the equivalent (or better) from my 5 year old. w14,000 for all exhibitions, includes the audio guide. Lockers there as you can't take anything in that is bigger than a small handbag. Free WiFi. Some exhibitions you can't take photos. Museum Cafe.", February 2017
107,5.0,World class!,"I was very surprised by this museum. We went there not expecting much, but was blown away by by the high standard, both content wise as well as location/architecture.Also being a huge fan of Anish Kapoor is was very pleased by the courtyard. Great shop as well!Highly recommended!", April 2016
108,5.0,Mini Tate Modern,"The museum is roughly divided in 3 parts, Korean artefacts, Modern art and the Special exhibits.  It all gels together quite well and will take you a good few hours all together, but well worth the time.  Love it!", January 2017
109,3.0,Come for swanky photo op  if you don't like modern art,"First of all, to get to this museum you begin by exiting at Hanganjin station through exit 1 if I remember correctly. Once above ground, you walk about 5 - 10mins before you make a right turn UPHILL... I emphasize uphill because the walk up is pretty steep so be prepared. Once you reach the museum you will see sculptures in the courtyard and such. This area is open to public, including the cafe and museum shop area of the place, but to see the actual exhibits, you will need to pay. The courtyard makes a pretty good photo op place.. it has that 'I'm so atas but hey, I'm approachable too' kinda look that you see plastered all over Instagram some times.. Cynicism aside, it does produce some pretty photos.Now, for the museum itself. Consider this a preemptive notice of sorts - Leeum Samsung Museum of Art is a modern art museum and modern art can hurt the brain a little sometimes. I convinced my friend to join me cause' I love museums and my friend loves me (haha!) but if you ain't into modern art, you really ain't gonna enjoy this museum much especially when there is an entrance fee involved. The museum basically has 3 permanent exhibits and 1 special exhibit space. When we were there, Olafur Eliasson's The parliament of possibilities was on exhibit. I naturally got excited cause this fella is strange as hell but then again, so are most modern artists (this is purely an opinion of my own. It is not intended at anyone or organization or manner of artistic expression #justsaying). I liked what I saw but I can't say much for my poor hoodwinked friend.. Modern art really is subjective.. Art discussion aside, the museum shop (??) inside has a really cool collection of modern minimalist items that range from scarfs to watches and the quintessential 'i'm so cool it hurts' hoodie.. If you don't wanna kill brain cells trying to figure modern art out but want to be 'part' of the supposedly cool vibe, just head to the museum shop. Leeum has a website in english, I'd suggest checking out what are the exhibits first before going, just in case you hate it.", December 2016
110,4.0,Inspiring place to spend a few hours,"I spent an afternoon viewing the traditional and modern art collections at this museum last fall. It was an inspiring place that I plan to return to later to see more. There are many interesting sculpture installations both inside and out of the museum. There are 2 main buildings, one for traditional/historic artworks and another for contemporary art. Lockers are available to house coats and baggage while you browse the museum. It is also handicap accessible. There is a very nice museum shop with beautiful though expensive gift options. I would recommend this museum to people aged 16 years and up. It would not be very interesting to children.", November 2016
111,4.0,Well funded/maintained venue.,"Interesting world-class exhibitions in a clean and well-maintained venue. While Seoul doesn't lack for decent galleries, Leeum stands out as one of the better ones. Its location and size are also a plus as some of the better ones are located further North across the river. Highly recommend at least one visit if you are an art lover (of course check what's on first).", November 2016
112,5.0,Great mix of old and new,"I went to the Leeum Museum last week.  For 8000 won you get a ticket for the day to see the historical section, the modern art gallery as well as any special presentation that day. It is best to pay for the electronic guides in required language to detail the individual works. The historical museum provided me with an introduction of the dynasties in Korean history.  The modern art works were very interesting, I had no clue what the artists were saying at times so that electronic guide helped me learn a lot. The day I went there was a special moving visual arts display which was a very interesting and  good fun. Would recommend.", January 2017
113,5.0,Just right,We took a taxi to the museum. The buildings are impressive and very modern inside and out. The main collections include both traditional and modern art. Mostly korean but we also saw some of our favourites like giacometti and rothko. The lighting on the works really adds another flare which I really liked. There isn't a lot of descriptions by the works so it might be worth getting an audio guide to appreciate them more in depth. We felt that the museum wasn't overloaded with art and was just right to see on a morning visit. There are extra collections which we didn't see though if you wanted more. There didn't seem to be many cafes or restaurants around the museum. Probably have to walk a bit to itaewon or something., November 2016
114,5.0,Exquisite Museum,"From architectural design to quality materials in construction, the building alone is worth a visit.  But obviously, the collection is marvelous and the way they exhibit the works is also contemporary and appropriate, appealing to the eye.  It's a bit of a taxi ride from city center.  Highly recommended.", October 2016
115,5.0,Amazing museum,"For long, our favorite museum has been the MOMA. We have found a new one : the Leeum Samsung Museum of Art. 3 buildings (in themselves pieces of art), one for the traditional Korea, one for the more modern one and one for special exhibitions (Olafur Eliasson at the time we visited the museum, just brillant). The museum is not referenced by all guide books, but that's a pity because it really worth the visit. We spent c. 4hours and did not see the time spent.We seldom recommend museum on trip advisor, but this one clearly deserves it.", December 2016
116,5.0,World Class Art!,"I cannot rave more about Leeum - it really is a stunning place with a wonderful curation of both modern and traditional art. As soon as I walked in there was a Kohei Nawa PixCell deer in the lobby (for any BigBang fan you'll recognise the art from the BaeBae music video)Would recommend you go with at least 2 hours in mind as their are separate areas for contemporary and traditional art both spanning multiple floors. If you like immersive art Olafur Eliasson's Gravity Stairs is one of the highlights.On the traditional side you will see lots of ancient pottery from different era's, very beautiful, calming and educational experience. On the contemporary side they had works by Warhol, Hirst and Murakami.The highlight for me were the Anish Kapoor sculptures outside (Tall Tree and Eye, and the Sky Mirror) - absolutely breathtaking and a must see for any modern art fan.Don't forget to stop by the store and pick up some art related merchandise - they have prints, printed scarves and lots of quirky items.Tip: no photos in the exhibition hall but you can take photos in the lobby and stairways.", September 2016
117,5.0,Beautiful space and exhibitions,"The Leeum is located near the Itaewon station. The streets of Itaewon are pretty quiet on the weekday morning I visited, and I appreciated the different vibe of the area in comparison to the other parts of Seoul. The museum itself is quite a sight to behold from the exterior, and the inside only gets better! The permanent exhibition features four levels. I started from the top floor which housed Korean ceramic artifacts and worked my way down, and the audio guide that came with the full admission price was well worth it. There is no descriptions written beside the artwork so that's where the audio guide comes in handy. The bottom two levels are dedicated to contemporary art, with the likes of Francis Bacon, Willem de Kooning, Anish Kapoor, etc. The spiral staircase connecting the levels centers around a stunning piece of installation art. There is another side of the building that features a special exhibition, and at the time of my visit, it featured the installations of Olafur Eliasson. Breathtaking and inspiring! I easily felt that the Leeum was one of the best highlights of my trip in Seoul.", October 2016
118,5.0,Outstanding architecture with (two) remarkable collection inside,"Two museums in one:The first museum is dedicated to Korean art and heritage; amazing collection of ancient ceramics (celadon, etc.).The second musum is must for lovers of contemporary art.Apart from a couple of pieces of Damien Hirst (not my genre but surely visitor-magnets) many interesting works of other top international artists of the caliber of Francis Bacon, etc., as well as of Korean artist I was not familiar with.Will go again", March 2016
119,4.0,Modern and Traditional Arts,I made the wrong turn when finding this place and notice the houses are modern in this area. This museum have modern and traditional arts display which you can appreciate both., February 2016
120,4.0,Carefully selected old and new works of art,Really enjoyed this museum.  We decided to buy a ticket to see the permanent exhibition and the current show.  The person at the desk showed us what the current show looked like to help us to decide.There are also recommended routes depending on the time you have available - which we only saw at the end of our visit!  Think it was on the printed info they gave us.The audio guide - a Samsung product- is great.  It automatically starts telling you about the work you are standing in front of.  There is an option to press a button to learn more.  For a lot of the works you can see a photo and turn the photo 360 degrees., November 2016
121,4.0,A quiet museum with various exhibitions ,"I went to see the Olafur Eliason (please excuse my spelling if it's wrong) and it was interesting. I'm not a big modern art fan but I found some of the art to be very unique and peaked my interest. It's a well laid out museum that has various exhibitions to go with it's permanent exhibition of Korean pottery and Buddhist art. Since I'm not a big modern art fan, this will probably be a one-time visit but I enjoyed it much more than the Tate Modern in London.", November 2016
122,4.0,"Leeum - an amazing arts museum, in the middle of Itaewon","I visited the Leeum in the November 2016. Even from the outside, the Leeum makes a very technological and modern impression. The cards for all three galleries are about 8,000 KW.Gallery number one is split into three floors and shows a wide range of Korean pottery, history and many other ancient to modern samples of Korean culture or art. During the transition in Gallery 1 from one floor to another, one can gaze at the wonderful stairs which, build an artwork as well.The next exhibition quite has a modern tone and appealed from my opinion, best to me. It really was quite breathtaking what could be constructed with just a few simple materials. I loved the room with the rainy day atmosphere, absolutely stunning.And last but not least: the 3rd exhibition. I personally do not like abstract and modern art, in forms of paintings, so this part of the gallery did not quite appeal to me. But for people who do, I believe it to be very interesting since it has a huge range of artworks like that. This gallery is spread over three floors. Traveller Tip: You can borrow an audio guide for free!You can also take with a camera, but in few cases, you may not be allowed to take a picture of the artwork for whatever reason. The exhibitions really take time, so make sure you consider it during your planning! This activity takes up to three hours inside of the gallery, if you listen to everything the audioguide tells you about each object. Normally, it may take about two hours or so. I believe there are some modern artworks outside, but I did not visit any of those.", November 2016
123,5.0,Amazing collection of celadon. Great products in the museum shop.,"I thought this would be a mostly-modern art-museum but they had amazing historical collections of Korea. We got audio guide and spent more than 3 hours..I didn't have much time and energy left to focus on their modern art but they were really good too! Samsung being so successful, yes they can have whatever they want..many of their colletion was much better than the ones I saw Korea's National Museum. And yes their souvenior shop was..great too.", December 2015
124,5.0,small but,Had 90 minutes to visit this museum. Happy that they are showing Olafur Eliasson. Their abstractions collection is pretty complete with all the famous western names. Remember to pick up a free audio help as it a better experience going around with it. The only problem is they do not allow photography inside the museum., November 2016

126,5.0,Small but varied exhibits,"I very much enjoyed my visit to the Leeum Smasung Museum.  I went on a Wednesday just after lunch and found there to be few other visitors which was a nice change of pace from many over crowded attractions I have seen in Seoul.There were 3 options for tickets- the permanent collection (10,000 won), the special exhibition (8,000 won), or a "" day pass"" combination of both (14,000 won).  I chose to get the day pass, which also includes a free audio guide(otherwise rental costs 2,000 won for permanent collection or 1,000 won for special).  The audio guide automatically picks up your location and tells you about the art you are in front of so there is no set order and it is very easy to use.  I would not have had as good of an experience without it.The permanent collection consists of 2 Museums (labeled 1 and 2).  Museum 1 has traditional art- pottery, calligraphy paintings and buddhist metal works. Having not been familiar with traditional works of this area, I found the audio guide to be very informative about the special features of each piece so I could better appreciate them.  I probably spent the most time in this gallery simply because I listed to the guide for almost every piece.Museum 2 has modern and contemporary art.  The collection is not extensive but they have a very interesting variety of works.  I particularly enjoyed seeing the Andy Warhol floral painting in person, the texture and contrast between the gloss in the black paint and the matte of the other colors can only truly be appreciated in person.For me, the highlight was the special exhibit, which is Olafur Eliasson's ""The Parliament of Possibilities"" which continues until the end of February 2017.  There are 22 pieces, many of which interact with the viewer through mirrors and light. The booklet reads ""The parliament of possibilities is the perfect occasion to explore the dynamic relationship between art and life""Other information included in the booklet that may be useful- parking is highly limited and public transportation is recommended. Usual admission is 10:30-6pm and is Closed on Mondays (as are many things in Seoul). The museum also includes a cafe and gift shop as well as a coat check, nursing room, and free wheelchair rentals.Overall I had a very pleasant afternoon here.  If you can appreciate the variety of art- from traditional pottery to recent modern works, there is plenty to see.  If you are coming only for one specific thing you may find it not worth your time.  I spent just over two hours here but could have easily spent 3 if I looked at and listened to the guide for every item.", November 2016
127,4.0,Interesting Neighborhood,"This museum is worth a visit if you're interested in Korean or Asian art. Went here to see the architecture and was amazed by the exhibit on Olafur Eliasson. If you're in Seoul and you love art, the exhibit is a must-see.", October 2016
128,3.0,Underwhelmed,We came here because of the many positive reviews. We were quite disappointed  in the small collection ofcontemproray art .   We felt it was not worth a visit   We should have instead headed to art galeries, October 2016
129,5.0,Unexpected gem of a museum,"In the heart of Itaewon, nice exhibits of artifacts and of modern works. 7,000W gets you in to all three halls, and it includes the audio guide.", October 2016
130,5.0,A bit of a hidden gem for art lovers.,"It's a little hard to find down the hill away from Itaewon, but worth the trip.  It's also worth checking their website as they rotate many exhibits.  But it's an excellent space with a nice permanent collection, and a great way to spend a few hours in Seoul.", October 2016
131,5.0,Highly recommended,"Am so glad I decided to drop by this museum.  Currently having they are having special exhibition - olafur eliasson ""parliament of possibilities"" which is definitely a big plus for me.", October 2016
132,5.0,Worth your visit if you are in Itaewon!!,We were given a 1/2 off discount (not sure why!) for all of the exhibits when we went (a Tuesday morning) and we thoroughly enjoyed the art.  Spent about 1.5-2hrs with 4 young kids.  The current special exhibition is awesome (olafur eliasson).  The pottery wing is skipable if you don't care about pottery :)  they are very strict about how you walk through the museum- and our kids made them a bit nervous- but overall it was great!  Kids 7 and under are free., October 2016
133,5.0,One of the best Museums ,The museum buildings and landscape are worth mentioning for their artistic styling and interest. Rent an audio guide which syncs up with the exhibits as you wander around looking. The museum is minimalist and easy to navigate. I look forward to my next visit., October 2016
134,4.0,Samsung Art Museum,"This museum is nested in the multicultural Itaewon neighbourhood of Seoul. It's located in the older part and you have to follow a few winding roads to find it. It is a gem in the rough surroundings. My wife and I enjoyed it thoroughly and we were pleasantly surprised by the exhibitions and the effects built into the museum. If you have an hour or two to kill, this is worth the visit.", October 2016
135,4.0,Cool contemporary exhibition,"Best way to get to Leeum is by taking exit 1 from Hangangjin metro station and continuing down the street until you see a sign that directs you to the museum. Entrance for adults is 10k KRW and the museum is well staffed by suit wearing guards, made me wish I hadn't worn t-shirt and shorts.The historical exhibition is small enough that you can maintain focus and the pieces are well displayed all though a little bit dimly lit.The contemporary exhibition (museum 2) contains some huge paintings and sculptures (just my kind thing!) by some really famous artists.", September 2016
136,5.0,One of (if not) The Best Museum in Seoul,"Located in the lavish neighborhood of Itaewon, this museum is hidden in the small roads, approx. 5-10 mins from the main street (depending on how long you want to get lost in the many roads which offer cute cafes and beyond) Everything here is showcased with perfection. The arts you find here is like nothing else. You need to visit it to believe that I'm no liar.", August 2016
137,5.0,One of the world's best,"Agree with the reviews. A must see museum. The contemporary stuff was more interesting to me but overall it's all worth seeing. There were so many moments I turned a corner and said ""wow"" in surprise at what I was seeing. Buildings and outdoors sculptures just add to the quality.", September 2016
138,5.0,"An excellent collection of Korean fine art, as well as Korean and International contemporary art!","Leeum Samsung Museum of Art is a collection of three beautifully designed buildings that house traditional Korean arts, a contemporary museum with Korean and international paintings/exhibits, and an education center.  The buildings themselves are as beautiful as the art - well worth a visit!", September 2016
139,5.0,"A definite ""must see""","As one guidebook said, if you only visit one museum in Seoul, Leeum is the one.  The buildings housing the museum, inside and out, are worth the trip alone and it is beautifully laid out.  Pay a few Won more for the day pass which gives you the interactive guide (a must!) and access to the whole building.The exhibits are excellent and varied enough to be of interest to a wide range of people.It's not well signposted from the station though.  Come out of exit 1 at Hangangjin (line 6) and walk straight ahead for about 500 metres.  It's then signposted to the right.", June 2016
140,5.0,A must see architectural collaboration!,"The Leeum museum of Korean and International Contemporary Art is a building done by 3 architects: Mario Botta, Jean Nouvel, Rem Koolhaas, Very well done! The Rem Koolhass one house the contemporary art, the Jean Nouvel hose the Korean Art (displayed beautifully) and the Mario Botta unify the 3 buildings", October 2015
141,5.0,Such a great museum,"Such a great museum - the art installations outside the museum as well as the architecture are amazing -.Art work inside is great as well.Very impressed, great museum, I wish we had a similar one in Hong Kong where I live in!If you have just one museum to visit in Seoul, go to this one.", April 2016
142,5.0,A mix of modern and classic Korean art (and more!),"Museum split into 2 parts. Museum 1 displays classic pieces from mostly 500-1000 years ago giving insight into not only Korean, but also a bit of Chinese art of that time. Educational (art-wise). Tye second part, Museum 2, displays 20-century art from Korea but also international artists in a way that connects them in a meaningful manner. The museum building itself with its exterior is quite cool too! Samsung made interactive displays that allow you to see a few 3D objects displayed in the museum from all angles (by means of virtual rotation etc.). I was not that amazed by that part, but looks cool. At least for those 2 vases it's meant for 😃", August 2016
143,5.0,Gallery nirvana ,"Ok so I've found my galley nirvana, this place is so very good. Curators need congratulating for superb exhibitions. Putting Rothko next to Buddha is inspired genius. Good mix of art, eras, special exhibition. Architecture wonderful", August 2016
144,2.0,Outside of museum was nice but disappointing inside,"The Leeum Samsung Museum of Art is located about 10 minutes away from the Hangangjin Station on line 6 of the Seoul Subway.  I found the outside of the museum to be well designed.  On the inside, the art work displayed may not have been my type of art because I was mostly underwhelmed, especially since the admission fee is 10,000 won ($10 USD).  It also didn't help that I found the staff on duty to be mostly cold and unfriendly.  I went near closing time so they may have been dying to get off of work but that shouldn't be an excuse.  I found that the War Memorial of Korea and the National Folk Museum of Korea to be better and the admission is free.", October 2015
145,5.0,Amazing museum and collection,"Undoubtedly, it's the best museum I've visited in Seoul. The three buildings are amazing gems built by renowned contemporary architects: Mario Botta (Swiss), Jean Nouvel (French) and Rem Koolhaas (Dutch). The displayed collection mixes Occidental and Asian contemporary art with wit, intelligence, with a rare sense of elegance. That's a must!", October 2015
146,5.0,Stunning ,One of the most enjoyable museum visit we experienced.  The Samsung tablet audio guide did its job brilliantly.  Great mix in modern and new artists.  Beautiful ceramic pieces.  Wonderful architecture.  Very nice coffee shop to take a rest before continuing to explore.  So please that we made the effort to go on our last day in Seoul., June 2016
147,5.0,Gem of a museum,Wonderful ceramic and art collection in a modern setting with an electronic guide that told the history of each piece when you stood in front of it., June 2016
148,5.0,Good Combinationof Everything,"The place has a great expensive collection of art and it is very affordable for the quality of time and money they put in the space. Where else will you see mario botta, jean nouvel and rem koolhaas buildings in the same place? I mean I wasn't in love but I really appreciated the large sculptures and their vast collection of korean art and international art.", June 2016
149,4.0,Private Collection of Samsung family,"Great Museum. Beautifully designed building.Architecture is very nice like Roppongi, however collection a bit small if you have seen MOMA.", May 2016
150,5.0,Stunningly curated museum,"This was the highlight of my Seoul stay. The curators did a fantastic job, and I would love to go back again to see what shows they put on next in their non-permanent wing. Take the time to get an audio guide for your tour. The museum staff designed them very well--the interface is extremely user friendly, informative, and helpful. Budget at least 2 hours, but if you love art/architecture/history you can spend 4 without issue. The museum is located near many excellent restaurants, so you can make a day outing of it, and even puncture your visit with some extended shopping/browsing nearby to avoid museum fatigue :)", February 2016
151,4.0,Serene time at the Museum of Art,On a rainy day I decided to do one of those indoor activities and chose the Leeum. At the ticket counter I opted in for the audio guide which was a Samsung tablet - definitely worth it. The architecture of the building is really beautiful. At the time I was there they had a great mix of traditional art and newer Korean graphic artists. They also have a nice museum shop with very friendly and helpful staff., September 2015
152,5.0,Great things in small packages,"Designed by three noted architects, this small museum has one wing for traditional Korean art - ceramics, paintings and artifacts (all amazing) and another for contemporary art and a third for children activities.  Beautifully arranged on a hillside with fantastic gardens.  Near shopping and good restaurants", May 2016
153,5.0,Great find!,Decided to strike out on my own for this one.  Family was involved in other things.Itaewon is a popular area with many things for people to do.  There are several hidden gems here!  The historical exhibition on Korean pottery was amazing! Some of the shapes i have never even seen.  And the colors!! I also appreciated the way they positioned more modern pieces among the antiques. There was an exhibit of royal pieces. This gives a slight glimpse of the opulence of some of the dynasty royal's lives.The 2nd area was completely modern., May 2016
154,5.0,"As a European a ""Must"". Great architecture from Botta, Kolhaas and Nouvel","So the star is the architectural solution in an area that was complicated by traffic and a rather middle to upper class private houses area. Excellent job. Samsung put a bit of cash into a collection that is very selective and has a highlight after another. You can see it was purchased in the last decade, as certain artists are there which were hyped up during that time. This is all sideshow - key is the sythesis of walking and enjoying a rather un-crowded museum.  Worth the visit", May 2016
155,5.0,Best Museum in Seoul,"Worth it! worth it! worth it!!!!! if youre a lover of contempoary art, this is your place even the museum cafe is designed especially for the museum. if you dont want to pay the entrance fee (which i recommend you do) the outside garden is free and equally amazing inside.", February 2016
156,5.0,Modern Museum in the Multi-Cultural neighborhood of Itaewon,"The Leeum Samsung Museum of Art has work from both East and West cultures.

Follow the signs.", May 2015
157,4.0,Perfect morning or afternoon trip with surprising beauty,"Maybe because the Leeum is not too big or because you have these separate buildings, you can spend a nice morning or afternoon here. The Korean classics are beautiful and there are interesting exhibitions (I saw a classical architecture exhibit). Besides that the buildings are worth a visit and the neighborhood is fun to stroll around.", December 2015
158,4.0,Modern and traditional,The Leeum Samsung Museum has both a traditional Korean art component and a modern art area.  We only toured the modern art area which was easy to see in a few hours.  We took advantage of the warmth indoors to escape the cold of Seoul's winter.  There are some very cool art pieces inside and of course the exterior courtyard offered some stunning installations., December 2015
159,4.0,Museum with a monumental architecture,"where nature, art and architecture have been put into one place in an aesthetic way, the space itself is worth visiting, though the artworks were being poorly presented.", January 2015
160,1.0,"Controlling, rude and pretentious ","This is by far the worst art museum I've been to having been to many free and an amazing museums around the world. The charge is 10,000 won ($10) for the pleasure of seeing the founder of Samsung's private collection. When you can see some amazing Joseon artefacts at the National Museum for free and you can see Andy Warhol, Damien Hirst and Antonio Giacometti's work for free in any national museum in Europe and other parts of Asia. Rude and unwelcoming staff. Too many rules including, you can't walk in your own free way around the museum, you have to use their patronising audio guide (using a Samsung device) a gimmick that tracks and gives you patronising and pretentious information at the same time for every piece in both museums.  Your told to move away from work even if you are a foot away from the barrier they've set! More staff to supervise visiors than necessary! At one point an over dressed member of staff followed me around the museumCan't take photos of their precious art collection! Never experienced anything like this. I have been to enough museum to know how to behave in them. To be constantly told what to in this museum was intolerable. Art is what you can get away with - Andy Warhol", December 2015
161,5.0,beautiful museum,"A great architectural venue. The collection is a bit of a show-off when it comes to Western artists, but the venue is magnificent and the collections well put together. Great Asian works too and special collection on Korean architecture was particularly interesting.", December 2015
162,5.0,Incredible range of art,"A two part museum, with a permanent collection and temporary exhibits. Ultra modern technology guides making navigating the museum a great deal of fun and very informative. Go for both parts if you have the time. Not to be missed.", December 2015
163,5.0,Beautiful museum,"I enjoyed visiting this museum quite a bit. It is evenly divided between a modern art collection and three floors of traditional Korean arts (the celadon pottery collection in particular is magnificent).The gardens out side house a couple of Kapoors and a Calder among others.If you have a couple of hours, take the time to visit this private museum. It's well worth it.", November 2015
164,5.0,Leeum - A world-class private collection and must-see for art lovers,"Visited the Leeum Samsung Museum recently and very much enjoyed our time spent at this world-class private collection in Seoul.  Entry fee is ₩10,000 to view the two permanent collections and ₩5000 for special exhibitions. Opening hours are 10.30am to 6pm daily but closed on Mondays. The Leeum permanent collection is divided into two Museums. First, you can view Museum 1 - Beyond Time, which features Korean artefacts of national treasure level of quality. Some of pieces on display are nothing short of exquisite, particularly the celadon collection. Outstanding examples of white porcelain, Buncheong, painted images and metal works are on display. This is a very special collection, the calibre of which you will not often see.  Interestingly, Museum 1 is spaced out over several floors, with a centre, downward spiralling staircase that resembles what you find at the Guggenheim Museum in NYC but on a much smaller scale. Museum 2 - Beyond Space features modern and contemporary works by Korean and international artists spaced out over three floors in a more conventional art space. The works change out from time to time. Of the works presently on display we enjoyed seeing Zeng Fanzhi's 'This land is Rich in Beauty' (1964) painting as well as Suh Se-Ok's 'Dancers I' (1988). Suh Se-Ok presently has a large scale exhibition at MMCA Seoul Museum if you want to see more similar works by this important Korean artist. Overall, we greatly appreciated our time at the Leeum Samsung Museum. This is is well curated and wonderful private collection, providing visitors an exceptional art experience. Leeum is certainly a Must-See for art lovers visiting Seoul. Hint: Almost all items of the Lleum collection on display can be viewed first on the museum website. This is well worth viewing in advance of your visit to help prepare yourself for what you will see during your visit to the Samsung Museum.", November 2015
165,5.0,"Beautiful architecture, first rate guidance through exhibits with Samsung technology ","The gardens with the spectacular outdoor sculptures were wonderful.  The exterior and interior designs were first rate, by amazing architects, Koolhaus, Botta and Nouvel. Exhibits included historical artifacts and contemporary international art. Most amazing are the mobile Samsung devices used for guidance, which audio described each piece fully and visually the device's display on the screen allowed expansion of the item for closer viewing. I'm returning for another tour when I go back to Seoul. Very nice cafe inside as well.", November 2015
166,5.0,Luvd it!,this I did on my own..and I loved it. 3-4 levels of art starting at the top where they have some of their national treasures from the Joseun Dynasty and also some dating even earlier., October 2015
167,2.0,Not quite worth your time or money,"While this is a stunning museum from an design standpoint, it was my least favourite museum that I visited while in Seoul. The exhibitions were rather boring in Museum 1 (you really have to like ceramics to enjoy it), but Museum 2 has some interesting modern art. I would probably not recommend visiting this museum to anyone being that there are several museums that are free and have far better exhibitions around Seoul.", October 2015
168,5.0,Architects must-visit,"Rem Koolhaas, Mario Botta and Jean Nouvel together in one place. No more explanation needed. Great architecture and great exhibitions(most of the time)", October 2015
169,4.0,A beautiful museum to visit,"I could see this museum from my hotel in Itaewan and was determined to find it.  Located a short walk from Hangangjin subway (Line 4 - Exit 1) walk about 50m turn right and head up the hill.Before you enter down the pathway, turn right at the entrance and enjoy the outdoor space.  There are views, sculptures and a great view of the 3 buildings designed by 3 different architects.On entry into the museum, you are overwhelmed by space and the clever use of natural light.  Visiting in Autumn allows the stunning autumn leaves to dominate and every window frames a perfect photo.  I have never seen so many staff at a museum, it felt a little overdone but clearly the art on display is important and showcases Korean traditional art and Korean and international modern and contemporary art.Take the time to visit both Museum 1 and 2, the staff direct you to the top floors by lift and then there are arrows to guide you around each floor and down the staircases in each museum, each a work of art in itself.What I enjoyed about this museum was the space, it was not overcrowded and the art on display was impeccably staged. It took me 1-2 hours to see everything and I did not do the audio tour but I would suggest if you have time to sit in the foyer area and watch the digital display or have a coffee in the cafe.  It's a very cool space and one of the most beautiful museum's I have visited.", October 2015
170,5.0,Perfecr Size,"This museum has two wings, one with historical Korean artifacts and one devoted to contemporary art. Both of them are strong enough to stand on their own. The location above the embassies gives a nice view over Itaewon. This museum is a nice two hour visit.", October 2015
171,5.0,A nice collection.,This is an amazing place to visit if you like contemporary art. They have two museums one for contemporary and the other for Korean historical artefacts. This is a beautiful building in itself. The spaces in the museum feel dark but you will find you are surrounded by minders everywhere you go probably because of no Photos policy. The collection is amazing and the audio guides (rigged up samsung phones) have proximity sensors and autoplay as an when you get close to an artwork. This was an ideal post mean getaway in a hot seoul afternoon. Worth the visit., October 2015
172,5.0,Great Place,"The Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art is a museum in Hannam-dong, Yongsan-gu, Seoul, South Korea, run by the Samsung Foundation of Culture.", May 2015
173,5.0,Diverse and interesting art museum,Excellent museum with a diverse collection matching antiquities with modern art. If you like vases this is the place to go! Interesting building as well. It's a short hike up the hill from the metro station. Definitely recommended!, August 2015
174,5.0,Nice and pleasant art gallary.,"Nice and pleasant art gallary. I usually don't go to art gallary, but I visited here because this art gallary has good reputation. I enjoyed various arts and it was calm and clean. I want to revisit here. I recommend this place.", October 2014
175,5.0,best museum in world,"this hidden gem is worth the effort to find.  The architecture and collections are truly world class.  Amazing installations, wonderful place to retreat from real world and spend time among some of the best art you will see, Western and Korean.  Lovely small store.  Very professional. You'll think you're in Paris!", August 2015
176,4.0,Good collection ,"A rare unique collection of porcelain artifacts ,  Buddhist paintings and structures spread over 2 museums", September 2015
177,4.0,"Wonderful exhibit, but a bit pricey and small","Leeum is a very nice museum, and probably the most modern of the major museums in Korea : the building itself is a wonder, ans on the Inside, the rooms are arranged in an interesting manner. The lightning is also amazing, especially for the Celadon collection. iPad-like devices allow for better viewing of some artifacts. The contemporary art section is also definitely Worth it, with works from major artists displayed (Francis Bacon, Alberto Giacometti...). These are really masterpieces in Western modern and contemporary art, something that is not always easy to find in Korea. There are two negatives to this museum though : it's pricey, being a private museum, and it's not so big (I'd say you need two hours to visit it, three hours max), so it might not be bang for your buck if you're defining ""bang"" as ""time"".", June 2015
178,5.0,Wonderful Collection - Worth a Visit,"You'll be pleasantly surprised at the quality of the collection at this museum. It has a good mix of both western and Korean artists in a well designed modern building. The entrance fee is a modest 10,000 for adults and 6,000 for children. We were able to comfortably view the two main wings in just a little over an hour.The audio tour is very inexpensive and you'll appreciate how it automatically updates based on the work you are standing in front of. The museum is about a 5 to 10 minute walk from the Hangangiin station on the number 6 line. Use exit #1 from the station and head straight. Take the first right and walk up the hill to the museum. You can combine it with a trip to Itaewon on the same subway line.", September 2015
179,4.0,Samsung Family Visit,"We were provided a free visit to the Leeum museum for Samsung employees, so I jumped at the chance. The museum has a variety of artwork from paintings, sculptures, pottery, sketches and metal work. With both historical and modern art fixtures, there is something here for everyone to appreciate. The inclusion of digital guides and interactive displays actually enhance the experience. This is unique because often the inclusion of modern electronic devices takes away from the calm introspective feelings that come from a museum visit. The staff are very friendly, and most understand English, making it a very foreign-friendly place to visit.", September 2015
180,5.0,Stunning museum,I was I had more time spend in this museum.  I did not plan my visit here well enough which was unfortunate as this would have to be one of the best museums I have ever seen anywhere in the world.  It is so intelligently curated and the art so brilliantly and thoughtfully displayed that the experience of visiting is overwhelming.  The Asian and Korean exhibits are just stunning and beautifully chose and displayed alongside some astonishing masters of western modern art.  In fact if you've ever felt a touch of cynicism regarding the worth of contemporary art this museum will easily dispel such notions.  It is just wonderful., February 2015
181,3.0,nice compact museum,"you are not allowed to bring your camera, the technology, building, lighting was nice but the exhibition kind of ordinary in my opinion", July 2015
182,4.0,Beautifully curated,"The collections are exquisite and beautifully curated.  I'm not a great fan of the audio guides, which repeatedly tell you how beautiful everything is as if you can't see it for yourself or make your own judgement.  Worth it just for the architecture alone.  Also the best latte in Seoul, in my humble opinion.", August 2015
183,5.0,Love at the Leeum,"Not as large as the Lourve or the MoMA, Leeum is equally astounding in terms of aesthetics and appreciation of ancient heritage. Tucked inside a quiet hill side of bustling Itaewon, she is perched on a little hill waiting to welcome art lovers and history buff alike. I went to the ancient Korean Art exhibit where Celadon and Porcelain art work were the main art pieces. Korean art is filled with splendor, resplendent and utterly mesmerizing for our eyes to behold. Worth a visit.", August 2015
184,3.0,"Nice building, not much of interest for me","This is a good museum for viewing Korean art and ceramics in a classier setting than most.  I'm not very interested in modern art, so the modern art section was a bit lost on me.  The admission is very overpriced in my opinion.", August 2014
185,5.0,High tech museum with impressive Korean art,"I came with no expectations, and left thinking it was one of the best art museums I've been to (I've been to many).  Firstly, the building itself is impressive, and conveniently located next to some cool restaurants and coffee shops. Secondly, the museum has both an antique Korean art collection and a modern art collection, so you get a rounded view of Korean art within the space of a couple of hours. Thirdly, their audio guides are the best - in that they automatically start playing the relevant section as soon as you approach an object - there's no need to fumble around for numbers (why aren't all audio guides designed to do this?).", May 2015
186,3.0,High expectations were not met,"From reading the commentary in the Lonely Planet guide to Seoul our expectations of this museum were high. We started with Museum 2, the contemporary art collection and to make a long story short : only a few pieces were worth the trip. Museum 1 was merely OK.", July 2015
187,3.0,Very high expectations that were not met,"In the Lonely Planet guide of Seoul this museum was highly recommended and thus we were expecting an interesting collection. Unfortunately, very few pieces were worth the trip to this museum.", July 2015
188,2.0,This was disappointing,"This museum was quite disappointing from what we expected. To start with, the exhibitions in the lobby, were the most interesting. The staff wasn't so friendly. Sort of resembling the old ladies working in the louvre or in a Russian tea pot museum. You are watched all the time by the staff. If you move to look closer on an object, the alarm will sound. Then I'm not really into modern art either. Or I was, but prior to this museum. I mean, there was literally a totally black painting. And it was slightly overpriced as well. But the building was appealing and futuristic and so was the art in the lobby.", April 2015
189,5.0,Fabulous Museum in Itaewon,"Visited the Leeum Samsun Museum of Art in April this year.  Architecture alone was worth the visit, but the distinct Modern Art and Classical Korean Art, ceramics and textiles were exquisite.  Located on a side street on Han river side of Itaewon it was a wonderful place to spend a rainy day.  Nearby is a fabulous complex called Passion 5 with one of the best restaurants and bakeries in Seoul.", April 2015
190,4.0,Varied Collection,"Tucked away in Itaewon, I got a little lost finding it so arrived with only around an hour to visit.  I would recommend giving yourself a few hours to spend with the two collections (the traditional art and contemporary), I wish I hadn't had to rush through.", July 2014
191,1.0,Same old same old.,amazing building filled with predictable bits....one would think that' in this day and age Damian Hurst and sadly Andy Warhol would have been confined to the dusty shelves....worhol  poppies must be so dated it's almost becoming back into fashion....the de Kooning and Joan Mitchell the best., June 2015
192,4.0,2nd visit,"My 2nd time here and this time I spent more time and also ventured into the traditional galleryMuseum/gallery 1 is traditional , with all the porcelain , gold and other ancient artifacts. Quite interestingly , they intersperse some modern pieces that were inspired by ancient art. So you see a Giacometti or something else next to a ancient vaseGallery 2 is the contemporary one, which I prefer. They have all the famous names - twonbly, hirst, bacon, kooning, Zhang Fangyi, Warhol et alI think the downside to this museum is that they don't have temporary or rotating art, so you see the same pieces on your repeat visit", June 2015
193,5.0,Faboulous,"For art lovers, this is a jewel: beautiful collection, amazing architecture, loved the contrasts between historical Korea and modern art. Fond of the audioguides: increadible user friendly and of course made by Samsung.Thanks to the friendly staff for the tour.", June 2015
194,5.0,The Best!!!,Nice Cafe within the building...superb art pieces and of the old and new...wonderful mix..take your time...do not rush through it..worth hiring the digital guide....personalised tour within...a place not to be missed....., May 2015
195,5.0,An Artists Art Gallery,"This is a favorite spot for any artist.  It's easy to spend 3 hours here.  The work is very up to the minute and the displays are expertly done to give the maximum effect for the work and the artist's intent.  There is audio if you like to be lectured to or you can forgo that.  The price for the shows are standard, similar to what you would pay in America or London.", February 2015
196,2.0,Absolutely overrated,"One of the smallest collection ever that need to pay 10K W. 3Floors of ancient and modern art display.walking uphill was a huge effort. Go to other Museum or Palaces...if you like architecture, go around backlane of itaewon you can see more interesting cafes and boutiques design.", May 2015
197,5.0,AMAZING...great collection....and design...,well I was so lucky because there was a exhibition of jean michel basquiat...wich I loved..the museum is located at itaweon neighborhood so you can have a chance to do both...it worth a visit !, November 2014
198,4.0,Beautiful collection in beautiful designed museum,Traditional Art en modern Art comes together in this inspirational building. Don't miss it and see for yourself!, May 2015
199,4.0,great building,"fantastic exhibits and art work. Its abit tricky to find but worth a visit. It shows how monder technology and art can work together. the building architecture is fab, with each one being different from another and in great contrast.", May 2015
200,5.0,Great exhibits and building,The way the museum shows traditional Korean art in one wing and modern Korean and World art in the other wing provides a great contrast., April 2015
201,5.0,Excellent!,Loved all the exhibits. I enjoyed the western and eastern mixes. I wish the cafe had a bit more food and drink - but the gift shop was nice!  Luckily there's some good restaurants around., April 2015
202,5.0,Packs a punch,"I really enjoyed my time here!Going to art museums is my second favorite thing to do when I travel and this is probably one of the best museums I've been to in a while.First the architecture is so beautiful and each section of the museum has it's own vibe that compliments the artwork that is on display. Second the entrance fee is completely reasonable and even includes a free audio guide (English available) with these high tech Samsung phones that automatically go off when you're in front of the art piece. The guide also has additional videos or photo books to look at the piece from a different view (like the back of it if you can't see it, or multiple pages of a book in a display case) This was REALLY helpful and I really enjoyed it.Third it has a wonderful mix of old and new. The first gallery is all older works, mostly ceramics, the second gallery is all modern works including some bigger names. I was really surprised to see three Giacometti pieces which was wonderful! The third gallery is the special events currently it's: Shooting the Elephant- this was my least favorite part of the museum- I wasn't a fan but the space itself was really cool! I hope to go back and visit when a different special exhibit is going through. Overall I had a great time and would recommend this art museum to everyone!", May 2015
203,5.0,Amazing art gallery!,"This is the best art gallery I have ever visited for a number of reasons:- The architecture of the building is as impressive as the artworks inside. - The collection in the second gallery are particularly thought provoking and by some extremely famous artists (e.g Gilbert and George) - I discovered a sculpture by Korean artist Do Ho Suh... One of my now favourite artists - The audio guide is ultra modern, like a Samsung phone, which is triggered automatically when you stand in front of each exhibit but you can also view close up images of the exhibits on the device.", April 2015
204,4.0,"Great building, quirky combination of artworks","The building of this museum alone is worthwhile visiting (especially the spiral staircase). Furthermore, I loved the combination of ancient celadon, Buddhist artifacts, and very modern art. Good audio guides too.", April 2015
205,5.0,Loved it!,"Came here with my brother and mom who aren't huge fans of art, but we all ended up enjoying it. The space is very clean, modern and the artwork is chosen very well. A great mix of some well known artists in Korea as well as some emerging artists. The place is very tranquil and was a great break on a hot, summer day.", June 2014
206,4.0,Contemporary Art and Design,"They often have a good variety of contemproary and modern art, as well as more traditional artistic approaches. It's good to get a wide range of award winning art pieces in one place. Special exhibitions are also particularily good.", March 2015
207,3.0,Hmm.,…this is a bizarre museum both architecturally and artistically.  Mainly installation art in three buildings each designed by a different high-profile architect.  Overall impression is that I'm not too sure., April 2015
208,5.0,Beautiful Museum,There are three building all in one location and each one is different. Designed by 3 different architects. The ceramic collection from the Chosun dynasty is beautiful. There are some Aneesh Chopra pieces including the stainless steel spheres at the entrance, March 2015
209,5.0,"Always nice, temporary exhibit","They host always interesting exhibition. Nice interior, but, ticketing woman was unkind.", June 2014
210,5.0,Incredible,We were a bit put-off by the odd location but I could not recommend this incredible gallery more highly.This is the only gallery we allowed time for on our trip and I am so glad. The contemporary collection on the ground floor of Museum Two is something I will remember for a very long time.If you purchase tickets to the two main galleries (7000 won) and the visiting exhibition (8000 won) you get a special deal for (10000 won) and one of the best audio guides I've ever used.The area around the gallery turned out to be fantastic with great cafes and drool-worthy local shops, March 2015
211,4.0,Can't you just feel the blue?,That was a direct quote from Agnes Martin. And it was the room with her paintings that moved me the most. Yes there are a couple Rothko's here. And the national treasures are impressive. But go see Agnes. Feel the blue., March 2015
212,5.0,Impressive,"An impressive museum with both old and new art. Museum building itself is a work of art. There are some longer-term displays and changing displays. At one part of the museum some Korean old pottery was beautifully displayed, at another there were modern paintings and installations (Hirst, Rothko, Naim June Paik and such). Also the changing display was very interesting and thought provoking. Museum has good, and of course beautifully designed, cafe.", March 2015
213,5.0,Sleek and modern with the prefect amount of interactive,"The museum is marries technology and art so seamlessly, that it was spectacular. Divided into three exhibition spaces - Museum 1 house traditional and some modern Korean art. Museum 2 exhibits modern and contemporary art from both international and local artists, while the Children's Museum exhibits more interactive modern artworks.The electronic information guide takes you through all three galleries seamlessly, with just the right amount of information and the ability to have 360 degree views of the works. The architecture and design of the building itself is pretty spectacular too - with the flow from space to space seeming to be organic. The Gravity Stairs were my favorite.There is no photography allowed in Museum 1 and 2, but it is allowed in the Interactive Gallery. You will also be required to check any bag that is bigger than a purse. There is a  coat check, as well as a lovely (but rather overpriced) coffee shop. To get to the museum by subway, take Line 6 to Hangangjin and use exit 1. Continue along Itaewon-ro to the first intersection, then turn right. Walk up the hill, past two intersections - the gallery entrance is about 5 minutes up the hill on the right and pedestrian entrance is just past the parking entrance, in line with the outdoor exhibition space. The entrance cost is 10 000 won - with an additional cost for special exhibitions.", February 2015
214,5.0,Expect the Best of Samsung! (And I'm not necessarily a Samsung fan),"This is a top-notch art museum you'll encounter in any part of the world. The collection simply exquisite, the ambience pleasant and sleek, and the technology really cool! I loved them all, and one of the highlights of its technological part was the 360 degree image you can see while watching the displayed item. Even if an item is displayed on its own, it's not easy to look both the top and the bottom, if not the front and the back. This technology solved the problem and you can see through magnifying glass as well. So cool!!! The gift shop was nice and my only complaint might be the cafeteria, where I couldn't find a single item that I can eat as someone with gluten, soy, and dairy allergies.", February 2015
215,5.0,Leeum epitomizes the ideals of modern and contemporary,"The terms ""Modern"" and ""Contemporary"" are sometimes used interchangeably, but those who are astute about the differences will know that difference in terms. So with that said, for art lovers, collectors and artists, Leeum Samsung Museum of Art is one place that should not be ignored. There are many amazing pieces by artists of historical importance like Warhol and Sugimoto, among others each of them important for different reasons at different times in the art world and actually seeing them in person is special for anyone who appreciates art.Some of the art in the collection at Leeum is exactly that: Modern. Some art pieces have both Korean and historical significance in and of itself. I will admit that art is subjective so some of the art they have just doesn't do anything for me as a graphic designer. Some of the art is strange; some of it is perplexing; some of it, I do not like; some of it, I actually love. And that's art: it's just a matter of opinion and subjective, but I think that it should be appreciated for what it is, and that is artistic. You don't always have to like everything you see; you don't always have to dislike everything that you see either; however, as a collection of modern art and as a museum, this is very good because it represents so many styles and artistic movements within the real of ""modern art.""It's a must see for art lovers and artists, so when in Seoul, plan on spending half a day there and browsing around the galleries. Check out one of the special exhibits that interests you, too. It's worth the trip.", February 2015
216,5.0,Eye-candy,There are two sections with traditional and contemporary art. Cheap hi-tech audio-guides helped us a lot but even without it eye-candy is garanteed., August 2014
217,5.0,Excellent modern art museum,"If you're into modern art and/or architecture _at all_ then this is worth a visit. The building itself is stunning, and the thematic flow of the exhibits is great. The collection isn't obscenely massive, but it's of very high quality, displaying prime examples of both Korean/Eastern and Western modern art. Get the little Samsung devices that use NFC to display info about the various works of art when you're near them.", February 2015
218,3.0,Worth visiting but ...,"I anticipated more from this museum, based on its name; my mistake. The architecture was interesting, as were the exhibits, but: (1) photography was not permitted, although the items were in general not necessarily light sensitive, and (2) the National Museum, as it turns out, had more and better examples of many of the items on display.", December 2014
219,5.0,Even for non art lovers,"Beautiful art is always a joy but when it is displayed with the elegance evidence at the Leeum Sansung Museum of Art, it's a moving and edifying experience.  The joining of art and technology was done amaziingly well with easy to use well curated narratives and visuals on the Samsung devices.  One could go on ecstatically but just go there.  The building alone is worth the trip.  This has to be one of the top museums in the world.  My one suggestion would be for the narrative to explain a bit about the function of some of the pottery as well as the spot on discussion of the artistry.", February 2015
220,5.0,"Beautiful space, well curated, awesome audio guide","It is so easy to enjoy a visit to this place as the layout makes it so easy to see it all as the curators intended.  Rather than quantity, they've chosen some of the best examples so yu really feel like every piece is worth a look.  Finally, the audio guide is the best ever as it starts automatically as you approach an object (via sensor in the floor I think) so you walk up and look while info plays in your ear.  If you move on before it finishes, it keeps up.", December 2014
221,5.0,Old and new mixed together,It is its 10 year anniversary and they mixed some contemporary artwork to compliment the old. I like it but some might find it distracting. You should have a guided tour.The historical artworks are so valuable to the history of Korea. Both museums are interesting and worth the visit., December 2014
222,5.0,Better collection than the national art museum,"This Museum/Art Gallery has an amazing collection of Korean artwork and an eclectic mix of modern piece set in an architectural amazing building. The portable guide show cases Samsung technology by providing multiple language explanations of the artwork automatically as you approach the art work (Near field communications).  We wished we had more time to appreciate this gallery further, allow at least 4hrs to enjoy.", December 2014
223,5.0,A MUST if you are into modern art,"A MUST visit if you are into modern art and good architecture. I spent 3 hours there and could have seen more, but got tired :-)Tips: - Get the cheap audio guide - makes you put your eyes on the right things- Avoid the museum cafe and shop: even as everything looks nice, the prices are just far beyond sensible prices elsewhere in Seoul", November 2014
224,4.0,Beautiful building and unusual pieces,"It is nice to go to a place that has a combination of the modern and the ancient.  Modern art is not to everyone's taste but I liked the assortment of choices.  In the part with older art, there were some questionable choices (like a Rothko painting among the pottery because the colors matched...) but the actual artifacts were beautifully displayed.  In the Buddhist section, there were items of adornment or ""clothing"" like hats and shoes that you don't normally see. It is also not so huge that it becomes overwhelming.  You can see most of it in a couple of hours tops.", November 2014
225,1.0,Like a North Korean prisoner camp,"1. So many guards - in many areas, there were three times as many guards as visitors.2. Very little depth in the background to the artworks.  There were small placards and a digital guide you can rent for an extra KRW 1000 (about one US dollar).  The placards for each piece have very little or no information about the piece.3. You cannot approach anything - an alarm goes off at about a foot and a half from each piece (50 cm).4. They have a ""children's museum,"" but the children are not permitted to touch anything in the exhibit except for one small workshop area where the children can use a pen to draw something that ends up on a computer.  Not even as good as any typical free app for iOS or Android.  How can you have a children's exhibit and have guards following children around to make sure they don't touch anything?!?5. No photos.  Not even out the windows at the view.  The guards enforce this policy with extreme prejudice.6. Entrance fees were KRW 10000 per person (about $40 for a family of four), and the exhibits are quite disappointing.  The digital guides are another KRW 1000 per person (why not just have QR codes next to the exhibits for you to browse or listen to from your phone?!?).7. The ancient art was OK, but there are better exhibits (see below).  The modern art was pretty crappy and had almost no integrating ideas.  The children's exhibit was particularly barren.As to the exhibits themselves, you are better off going to any normal museum in Seoul, such as the one at Kyeongbokkung Palace.  Apparently, this is the Samsung chaebol's personal holdings, and apparently the daughter lives in the upper floor of the building.  I wonder if this whole thing is some kind of technique to avoid taxes.", November 2014
226,2.0,Way less than expected,"Announced as the best museum in Seoul, the expectations were high. But what a disappointment. Entry fee way too high for what you get. Artist works are ok, but not the top for this entry fee. Will never return, there are many better museums in town!", October 2014
227,3.0,"Even not much expectation, but still a bit disappointing","Some of the art works, especially the modern art portion, are really too casual.  There isn't much that draws our interest...", November 2014
228,5.0,Old pottery,I liked in particular the display of old china. It was exquisite. The best thing about this museum is the phone guide. You just stand in front of the item you would like to be explained and the voice recording goes automatically without you needing to push any buttons. Lovely!, October 2014
229,2.0,Entirely too controlling.,"This is a for fee museum. Entry is 10,000 won. So not bad but not free. They have a free bag check that they want everyone who is carrying a purse or bag larger than an evening purse to use it.They even have a measuring template. So when I transfered my passport and cell phone and wallet tissues lipstick and like that, into a small nylon shopping bag that I carry just for this eventuality, I was told it was to big to carry into the museum. I put the bag on the template and it folded up into smaller that the shape. The docent said I would have to carry the bag all bunched up. I said thank you and left the area and hung the strap on my arm. Then we started the tour using the audio guide 1,000 won, it was controlled by radar or something ,it had pictures you could pinch larger but the information was really boring and if you taped to hear more you had to stand right at the exhibit to listen. If you wondered off to another one that one came up. So no sitting and listening to extra features or looking ahead.Also no walking against the direction of the designated flow. The docent  harasses you until you comply, ' resistance is futile ' . They have an Ok collection. Not anywhere near as complete as the National Museum, which is wonderful. Everything behind plastic boxes, so why they are so worried about bags I have no idea. There were no crowds. But because you had no flexibility with the audio guide people had to stand in a bunch when there should have been room for everyone. The modern art collection is Ok. But I had to go through the bag measuring hassle again and just elected to ignore the insistence. We started our tour on a middle floor and were literally chased off and told we needed to start at the proper level. The modern art section is not in chronological order. And again no crowds. Just control freaks everywhere. Go to the Natioal Museum. It is wonderful. Avoid this thing. So not worth the money or aggravation.", October 2014
230,1.0,Poor experience!,"After you buy your ticket, you go to the lockers where you have to give all large bags. There is a sign mentioning you 'd better don't leave any valuable items in the storage room. As our camera is a valuable item, we wanted to take it with us but this was not allowed. We assured we wouldn't take a photo but even then we couldn't take this with us. Strange... as everybody can take his Phone with him inside the museum and, as everybody knows, people do take pictures with their Phone (we saw people doing this). There were no maps or other of the museum. We visited musem 1 and 2 and both were very disappointing! After we took our bag and camera again out of the storage room, we saw there was a third part at the same entrance of the childrens museum part. Too bad, as we couldn't visit this part with bag and camera. The museum is in Seoul on every map and in every guide with the picture of a large spider. Asking where we could see this art creature, people said the spider was replaced by something else. So, another disappointment. I should say: if you doubt on this museum don't go! There are plenty other things to so and to see in Seoul that are much more interesting!", October 2014
231,4.0,Interesting contemporary art museum,"Right in the city with easy access by subway and a short walk to the museum in a residential area.  The museum offers a striking and creative facade.  I liked the audio guide powered by Samsung mobile phones with a specialized application. The digital guided tour was well paced throughout the museum with a well balanced description of each piece on display.  There are 3 different sections, 1 section offering ancient pottery and art, a 2nd section for contemporary art and a 3rd section for child education and culture.  It is a very interesting combination.  There is never a dull moment.  I was treated to interesting displays throughout my 3+ hour visit.", October 2014
232,5.0,Good display of ancient Korean ceramics,"Visited with a Korean friend who wanted to show us Korean ceramic s, from 600 AD to 19th Century.  Very good display.  Very modern museum.", September 2014
233,3.0,Modern museum with good art collection,"There are no Samsung devices in this museum, just the art - traditional and contemporary. I was impressed by contemporary collection - just 2,5 floors with some works from Hirst, Ai Weiwei, Rothko, and some Asian artists.", September 2014
234,5.0,Excellent!,Awesome collection. Well curated mix of old and new. Fabulous architecture and site. Amazing digital support!  My only regret is that we ran out of time to see it all.  It is in itaewon - and was a ways from our hotel. But just two subways and eight stations. Wish I had spent the day there. My top favorite museum for Seoul., September 2014
235,5.0,Nice art !,Very nice place to visit especially if you love art ! Many artists and very cool building ! Worth a visit !!, June 2014
236,5.0,Best managed art museum I've ever seen,"This has a LOT of great pieces, but of course, not too many of the greats like you find in the Louvre.  It really comes into it's own if you opt for the audio tour.  You're given a Note 2, and exhibits will start explaining themselves to you as you walk around the Museum.  These are not one or two line blurbs though.  The art explanations are detailed, interesting, and in my view better than any museum in the world.  You really do learn to APPRECIATE the art because everything is explained to you, and every single detail becomes crystal clear.  All in all I'd have to say this is the most enjoyable art museum I've ever had the pleasure of visiting.  (I'm not even an art buff)", September 2014
237,4.0,Good museum,"Located in the middle of a residential district, I took a cab here. I headed straight to the contemporary section with the electronic guide (samsung phone and headphone of course)There's Andy Warhol, Damien hirst, Ai Weiwei etc, so pretty interesting There's an outdoor section as well with sculptures but it was a hot summer day so one can't stay long Didn't go to the traditional sectionHad to wait by the entrance for a cab and thankfully it wasn't too long as some people would drop off", August 2014
238,5.0,Fabulous museum,"I loved this museum.  Unlike most of the other major museums in Seoul you have to pay for entrance: 10,000 KRW.  But I consider it well worth the cost.  The museum is in two parts:1.  Antique pieces (pottery, paintings etc.)  The collection is quite small but well curated which I prefer to a huge amount of random pieces.  There were pieces of modern art interspaced, in some cased to complement the antiques and in other cases directly inspired by them.  I thought this was a really nice touch.2.  Modern art.  Its mostly Korean but with some foreign pieces present as well.  The galleries are by theme rather than country of origin allowing you to compare and contrast how Korean and western artists reacted to new artitistic trends.For an extra 1,000 KRW you can get an electonic guide: a small tablet and headphones which automatically comes to life as you approach each exhibit.  It's really great and well worth the small extra costs.  All together, this museum is just first class, nice exhibits well created with a nice guide in English providing you with as much or little information as you want for each piece.  A must-visit in Seoul.", August 2014
239,5.0,Fabulous,"Small but excellent museum of art, over six floors.  The top floors are Korean traditional art and artefacts.  Our favourite floors were housed the international collection including Andy Warhol, Anish Kapoor, Damien Hirst and Jeff Koon's extraordinary smooth egg with bow sculpture.  Highly recommend", June 2014
240,5.0,Call Before Going,I tried to visit today and was sadly disappointed. When I arrived the sign said it will be closed for a few weeks to prepare for an anniversary. Not sure the dates of closure. I rated it excellent because of all the reviews., August 2014
241,5.0,a must see,"anyone who enjoys good art and architecture must go.  Very easy to find - right off the subway - and worth a half a day.  Where else can you see architecture by Rem Koolhaus, Jean Nouvel, and Mario Botta.  plus work by Damien Hurst, Anish Kapoor, Jeff Koons, Alexander Calder..................", June 2014
242,5.0,Combine it with a Western-style meal in nearby Itaewon,"Half of this museum is devoted to traditional historical objects, ceramics and jewelry. It's similar to what you see at the National Museum of Korea, but a smaller and better-curated selection. Elegant stuff. The other half is contemporary art. What's neat about that half is that, in addition to Western artists you usually see at high-end museums, you see some really edgy contemporary Korean artists. Very creative and unusual. The museum is not huge. I arrived 1 hour before closing and managed to see most of it while only feeling a little rushed. It's a little hard to find up in a residential neighborhood in the hills. You may want to have a hand-held GPS with you. But it's only a 10-minute walk up from Itaewon, where you can find many Western-style restaurants if you need a break from kimchi. Admission in April of 2014 was around $10.", April 2014
243,5.0,Excellent if you like contemporary art,"This is one of Seoul's finer museums, considering this is  a city of excellent museums.  Tops in showing modern & contemporary artists.  It's located on Itawan, a great shopping street.", June 2014
244,5.0,A must visit museum in Seoul,"It contains an impressive collection of Koreana treasures.  The building is also amazing.  Entry fees might be a little expensive, nevertheless, if you appreciate art and want to better understand Korea, you must visit this private museum.  It's worth every penny!", July 2013
245,4.0,Good selection of antiques and modern art,"For one family to acquire this amount of art and Korean antiques is quite a feat and certainly worth a visit.   I would class this as a medium sized museum so if you have a short attention span before you become overwhelmed then the Leeum is perfect.  Personally I thought the architecture of the building was amazing.  It was lovely to wander round the spacious floors and enjoy the peace.  Even looking out of the windows and seeing the tall swaying bamboos was an extension of the whole experience. On a practical level, plenty of toilets on each floor, good gift shop and a coffee shop downstairs.  However, it is five minutes walk to the main street so plenty of restaurants and coffee shops to choose from there.       Definitely worth a visit.", June 2014
246,5.0,Interesting collection of contemporary art,"An easy walk from the subway station, The Leeum Museum is a must visit for art lovers who are into contemporary art. The place is easy to explore and the collection well laid out. A good place to while away your time if you have extra time in Seoul.", May 2014
247,4.0,Good-sized museum with a well-curated mix of ancient and modern art,"The location is not quite the easiest to find by metro/foot but the search is good you need a break from the main touristy places and shopping. The collection is well curated. There are many interesting pieces to look at both outdoors and indoors. I recommend paying a little extra for the audio guide. Go through the permanent collections before looking at the modern art section. As the museum is not massive (like, say the Lourve in Paris), setting aside just 3 hours to enjoy the trip to the Leeum is good enough. There is a little cafe on the ground floor serving just some pastries and beverages. I recommend this attraction wholeheartedly.", April 2014
248,5.0,GREAT but EXPENSIVE to ENTER,"Can see the chairman Lee family’s collection. Quite extensive from gorgeous Korean antiques to modern pop-arts. Very diversified portfolio in each level, and I certainly enjoyed the architecture. Modern, spacious but minimalistic with perfect lighting controls. The guide book was thoroughly prepared in different language and the souvenir shops offers impressive stuff, from scarf & rings to art works; could be expensive but you couldn’t buy anywhere else. One flaw is that it’s quite expensive to get in and there are not many sitting places, nor restaurants like Tate Modern. Understandable as business model and motivation are different. All of my European friends were quite impressed from A to Z. Can definitely visit again.", July 2013
249,5.0,Spectacular museum,"Loved the architecture, the outdoor area, the combination of traditional and modern art. dislikes: nothing!", November 2013
250,3.0,little bit expensive,"almost all the museums in seoul are free, bigger and betterthis one costed me something like 10usd... if you have just a few days in seoul go to the war museum and national museum, they are better... but still if u like art, this is ur place... also photos are not allowed inside... :(", October 2013
251,4.0,Great art museum,"One of the highlight when we traveled to Seoul. With a day-pass of 10000 won, you could see 2 permanent exhibitions or with the addition of 2000 won, you could see all the special exhibitions. The permanent exhibitions include classical and contemporary art. The classical collections have many treasures and national treasures with many artifacts, mainly pottery objects and Buddhism relics, not so much on paintings. While the contemporary collections have a fair amount of paintings. We spent about 3 hours there.", May 2014
252,4.0,cool quiet modern place,They have sculptures and painting of huge name artist. Their special exhibits are indeed special. Cool architecture. My only complaint is the pricy admission fee. The size is one fifth of Region of Honor and they still charge about the same price. Oh well., May 2014
253,5.0,My Favorite,"Went to many museums during my stay in Seoul. This was my favorite. Great collection. Great audio guide. No pictures though. Pay the 12,000 for the day pass, definitely worth it.", May 2014
254,5.0,Excellent art museum,"It has something for everything.  There are 2 permanent display; the historic art with porcelain ware and paintings from the early Korean periods, and the modern art museum.  The KRW 12,000 fees for a whole day pass allows you into the permanent display and the seasonal exhibits and also an audit guide that works on sensor bassi (it sense the display you are standing near and starts the guide). Great combination of using modern technology for a museum.", April 2014
255,5.0,Great collection,The museum is off the main road but there are signs once you get on the sidewalk.  Somehow it's not indicated on the subway's neighborhood map.  It's a nice walk to reach the museum.  You get to see three buildings designed by famous architects and the collection itself is the best of the best.  Well curated as well.  I shouldn't have gotten the audio guide.  I really didn't have time to get an explanation for each item.  Just walk leisurely and stop at an item that you like., April 2014
256,4.0,ART MUSEUM repeat ART MUSEUM,"It is an art museum. Lots of art works and ancient pieces that they show us. My friend and I thought it was about SAMSUNG's technology development museum cuz of the name. Haha. Maybe we didn't read for info that much.If you're looking for art work and Korean ancient pieces - then Yes, come here. It is very nice and the pieces are showing and organising in the modern looking way. Very nice.BUTIf you think they will show you how SAMSUNG's technology has developed, (just like we think) don't bother coming. Hahha. You can't take pics inside. But they've got free wifi. :)", April 2014
257,4.0,Nice museum,"Leeum museum is nice and in many countries it would a star but in Seoul it's main advantage is a location. It is very central and one can see a nice art by taking a short stroll, if staying in a central area. Gates of Hell are located right at the entrance and we really liked them. Do not forget to ware goggles provided by the museum. It makes a huge difference.", March 2014
258,5.0,Amazing Collection,Very good collection.  The outdoor pieces are also great.  Its a little hard to find if you're taking the metro (or i think i should say its rather far from the metro) but hey we made it and were happy we did., November 2013
259,5.0,Awesome with the audioguide,"Great museum but there is basically no information inside the museum so if you enter without the audioguide, you will just go through the museum with no idea about what you're seeing.The audioguide is just 2000 won and is really great, it's a samsung phone with a lot of info. You can also select a highlights option which will show you a map with the main things to see. And when you arrive in front of a painting or sculpture, the audioguide will automatically start, explaining you what you're seeing. Pretty awesome.The museum itself is really well designed and you will see various pieces, from ancient korean art untill weird modern art. Closed on monday, entrance is 10 000 won.", March 2014
260,4.0,A cosy sampling of choice Korean art,"Leeum Museum is a quiet oasis near the hectic Itaewon surroundings. It is a cosy space and has a beautiful collection of works of arts, especially of Korean ceramics. The Western collection is not so impressive, except for the huge spider bronze sculpture outdoors, whose author's name I forgot, but belongs to the same series of the one in front of Roppongi Hills in Tokyo. They always have very nice rotationg exchibitions. The architecture is quite pretty and the place is well worth a visit as a welcome respite from the busy activities in the internationalized Itaewon area.", September 2013
261,4.0,Interesting museum,The building itself is a work of art.  The collection and special exhibition are exceptional.  The cafe is small and has a limited selection., September 2013
262,5.0,great art experience,"I always enjoy coming here. The amount of art is not overwhelming and you get to see both old and modern art.  If you do not want to battle the crowds that can be found at the national museum and see quality foreign and Korean art, this is the place to go.", October 2013
263,5.0,Great Museum - Although Subjective,"Really well done museum and great area to walk around when you are done with the museum. The technology they have for the audio tour is second to none.  The only issue we had was that the audio tour would suggest that the piece in front of you is the ""most beautiful"" of its kind... This happened repeatedly and the museum should note that beauty is subjective and no museum or curator should suggest such things when describing the work in front of them.", October 2013
264,5.0,Best Museum in Seoul,"I've been here 2 or 3 times and I've never been bored. Honestly, I think that you may need at least two visits to appreciate it properly. It's really 2 museums in one. In museum one, they display traditional art. Lots of pottery, Buddhist art, paintings, etc. It's beautiful, well curated, and gives you some insight into traditional Korea. To exit museum one I descended one of the most amazing spiral staircases. It was hewn out of white marble (or some other white stone) and to get the full effect try to come on a sunny day. You won't be disappointed.Museum two, was my favorite. It was all contemporary and modern art by a varied assortment of artists. I was surprised by some of the big names they had. I had to return just to watch the full 3rd cycle of The Cremaster by Matthew Barney. Don't miss the art outside either!", February 2013
265,3.0,Disapointing,"I was very excited to see this building but left feeling short changed! Externally its not particularly attractive but internally its well laid out and has some elegant features. It's comprised of three distinct spaces, each designed by one of three different architects, and each housing a separate aspect of the permanent collection. The collection is brilliant, from centuries old porcelain to contemporary video art, they have it all! My experience was let down in three ways: mainly by the aloof, snooty staff; secondly by the high entrance fee; and lastly by the camera ban (i understand why i can't take a picture of a painting but why can't i photograph the building - or even the view from the window!). Bit of a naff experience.", July 2013
266,4.0,A must!,"I made this my first stop in Seoul, I was really looking forward to visiting it! Its architecture drew me there and left almost pleased, the Samsung Child Education & Culture Center was closed to visitors, such a letdown! Museum 1 was boring to me, but went in anyway to check out the rotunda. Museum 2 was enjoyable but just showing its permanent collection, which was ok but didn't make it up for the disenchantment of being unable to check out the inside of Koolhaas building. I guess it was probably bad timing, but definitely worth going and have a look around this interesting ensemble!", November 2013
267,5.0,Museums and art lovers - don't miss it!,"An international level museum. World known artists and impressive displays in a unique building. Don't miss the outdoor sculptures of Anish Kapoor and Calder and Takashi Murakami's installation in the lobby hall. Luckily there was a Calder exhibition, but the permanent collection is also beautiful and interesting! Easy to reach by the brown metro line to Itawon", October 2013
268,4.0,Leeum Samsung Museum of Art - Excellent Calder exhibit,"Leeum had a rather memorable collection of celadon, bronze and other national treasures viewed last year which encouraged a return during a recent trip to Seoul. In addition, I had the chance to see their current special exhibit on Calder which was worth visiting on its own.Individual entrance fees are KRW10000 (~USD10) for the permanent exhibition and KRW8000 (~USD8) for the special exhibit, but there is a reduced day pass of KRW14000 (~USD14) to visit both. The digital guide costs an extra KRW2000 (~USD2) and while it enhanced the viewing experience in this modern private museum, did not think visits would be hindered if you don't rent one.The digital guide operates on a sensor and automatically plays when you come close to objets d'art, while containing additional information to read. Its use can significantly increase the time spent in Leeum, especially because of the long physical descriptions of what is evident in the item. I did like the explanations on why an object is rare, or how it was made.The permanent exhibit remains impressive on this second visit.  The collection offers a small (but not insignificant) number of high quality, well-preserved, beautiful historical items and art works which are displayed for individual appreciation. The highlight of this visit would be the special exhibit on Calder, the father of mobiles. This is a comprehensive exhibit featuring Calder's beginnings, from his charming wire sculptures, to jewelry, to visually striking paintings, and of course to his mobiles, which were many sorts: large and small, while some were on the ground and others hung from the ceiling. This was indeed well-done and much enjoyed, and the visit was hindered only by a big group that had a loud-speaking guide. Anyway the Calder exhibit felt worthy of the entrance fee and I wouldn't mind coming back to see this again. Unfortunately the exhibit ends on 20 October 2013.There is no photography allowed in the permanent exhibit but the Leeum brochures contain a good amount of photos which serve as substitute.The outside area was being renovated last year and Bourgeois' spider is now gone (although it remains on a few Tourism brochures). This area, which is open to the public, now features a towering installation of chrome balls. There is also a large mobile installation behind it.Once again, this was a very good visit to the Leeum, covering the exhibition rooms for around 3 hours. For those who have been to the Leeum before and find themselves in Seoul again, it's worth checking back to see if the special exhibit would be of interest, as this recent one on Calder was well put together and very much enjoyed.", October 2013
269,5.0,Smiling from ear to ear,"Simply loveeee Leeum! My background is art and design so coming to Leeum was the highlight of my Seoul trip. I was pretty bored with the shops in Myeongdong and a bit disappointed that autumn has not really kicked-in yet. Was hoping to get some pretty autumn photos but the leaves were still green. Fortunately, Leeum was able to make me smile from ear to ear. The museum building itself was a masterpiece and it boasts excellent collections from traditional to modern art. This museum is a must-go place if you ever travel to Seoul. Tips: the best way to get there is by taxi (approx. USD 5 from Myeongdong area).", October 2013
270,5.0,A Seoul with both traditional and modern elements!,"The museum was inspiring! Very beautiful and showed a modern side of Seoul. I think it’s a must to go, after visiting all the ancient building and palaces. It gave me a better view of Seoul, strong tradition, still so young and energetic!", December 2012
271,5.0,Away from traditional museum,"Everything was excellent. From the buildings' architecture, to the selection of masterpieces. Leeum shows you treasures from Asian countries as well as modernist masterpieces.Unlike other museum, there is not this oppressing feeling when you see so many pieces and don't know where to look. It seems that everything has been carefully selected, and displayed in the best possible way.And it is owned by Samsung: their team made sure to use the best technologies and made it very educational. Perfect for childrenOne of the best museum I have been to", October 2013
272,4.0,Interesting Place,"A museum where the space is a masterpiece on its own.There are few art pieces, modern and  antiques, displayed with a lot of  care. it worth the visit.", September 2013
273,5.0,Great modern museum !,"I enjoyed this museum during a couple of hours. It has many floors and many modern paintings, sculptures and as well old korean potteries to see. I really like this museum for  it's architecture inside and outside as well. Good job Samsung to have invested into Arts ! Free wifi at this museum, exit # 1 of subway station Hangangjin Station on Line 6.", August 2013
274,5.0,Excellent!,"I love this museum.  There's a great collection of traditional Korean art, and some good contemporary pieces.  What I love best, however, is that the building itself is gorgeous, and almost like a work of art itself.", August 2013
275,5.0,Superb art museum,"If you only have time for one gallery in Seoul, this is the best choice.  It is architecturally stunning, and has both traditional and modern collections.  A high point for us was a whole floor of beautifully displayed ceramics (Celadon) from the 12th century, each item in its own individual glass case with precision lighting.  Utterly different was some modern work by Rothko, de Kooning, Gorky and Bacon.  The museum is on the south side of Namsam, not that easy to reach by subway - probably best by taxi.  Then its a short walk downhill to Itaewon with its many restaurants, bars and cafes.", August 2013
276,5.0,Awsome!,"Yeah, this museum is not well spoken around, but I liked it a lot!You should rent the audio tour, and then you will learn a lot about korean ceramics, painting and other traditional arts.They also have a ""modern art exposition"", which features some contemporary art!My recommendation is to come here and then have some lunch at Itaewon, since it is walking distance! On your way to Itaewon  there is some small cool shops!", July 2013
277,5.0,That is word class in many respects,"For all that are interested in contemporary arts and architecture, a visit to the LEEUM Samsung Museum of Art is a must. Often there are temporary exhibitions on specific artists or periods. Swiss visitors are particularly encouraged to see architecture from famous Swiss architects such as Mario Botta.", May 2013
278,5.0,Wonderful buildings and collection,A wonderful collection of Korean art and international modern art.  The architecture of the three buildings would be worth the visit alone.  We arrived just as a tour in English was about to begin.  The guide was articulate and helped us appreciate the wonderful classical pieces of Korean art in the collection., June 2013
279,5.0,Fabulous,"A really fantastic introduction to Korean art. Such a classy museum! Exhibits are introduced by a friendly voice on the rented (Samsung!) device, and this adds to the experience.", July 2013
280,5.0,Best small modern art museum I have been to for a while,"Blown away by the beauty of the architecture & the nicely curated exhibits in this place. Well worth the Samsung talking guide. Easy & small enough not to be tiring. The older Korean pottery was amazing but then so was the newer & so was the modern art section. Whole place very accessible partic. If you are a mixed bunch with some not so keen on "" museums""", July 2013
281,4.0,Well curated snapshot of Korean art,"I only had a couple days in Seoul, so had to pack in my sightseeing carefully; this art museum was easy to fit in just a couple hours due to it's small size and had an appealing permanent exhibition. It seemed carefully curated and provided a nice taste of both traditional and modern/contemporary Korean art. There was some international modern art as well, with samples of work from easily recognizable Asian and Western artists. Besides the collection, the building itself was also beautiful and you could tell a lot of thought was put into the entrance to and movement though the building. While I love art and always want to see a lot of it when I travel, I'd also recommend this place for those who aren't huge museum fans but just want a taste. Not only is it easy to digest, but it was easy to get to; a short enough walk from the subway station, which was lined with a great variety of restaurants, cafes and boutiques. All in all, this was a very pleasant way to spend part of the afternoon.", February 2013
282,5.0,The Anish Kapoor exhibit was breathtaking~!,"I didn't know who this man was prior to my visit to the museum but every single piece took my breath away.  Sure, the exhibit is long gone by now, but the facilities are top-notch.  They couldn't have done anything better in terms of interior decorating that could make this place more impressive than it already is.  It truly is a diamond in the rough and hopefully they'll have something meaningful and worthy on display during your visit.", February 2013
283,4.0,Give yourself time to enjoy,We only had a short time to explore the museum which the Grand Hyatt overlooks. The description system on samsung phones is really good and very comprehensive. It was a fascinating place and definitely worth visiting., June 2013
284,4.0,"An excellent collection of celadons in particular, housed in a beautiful building","This is an interesting museum, with both traditional Korean art and some very modern stuff. The building that houses the various collections is gorgeous. Do take the audio guide, which is quite high tech and fairly interesting, unless you have less than one hour to visit, in which case you wouldn't be able to listen to all the explanations.", June 2013
285,5.0,Great museum,"Great but standard contemporary art, still one of the most interesting in SeoulSponsored,or owned, by the Samsung family", June 2013
286,5.0,"Go, you won't regret it",Gorgeous architecture and well chosen modern art pieces make this museum. I'm not even very interested in the traditional Korean art and pottery aspect and I still think that museum 2 (the modern art museum) was worth every penny of the ticket price., June 2013
287,5.0,Must see Museum - Architecture and Contents - Outstanding!,This was easily my favorite museum in Seoul - and possibly in Korea (read my blog at MontrealMadame (dot) com to see those reviews). There are 3 unique buildings - each designed by a different architect - and each remarkable in it's own right. But unlike the Guggenheim in Bilboa, June 2013
288,4.0,Korean history through art.,The Leeum experience starts at the door and outside the building were pieces of art are displayed. Even the walk up to the door is a work of art (by Miyajima) with the cycle of life presented by bright aqua led numbers continuously changing. We choose to see the permanent, May 2013
289,4.0,Worth a visit,"Leeum Samsung Museum is worth a visit.  The museum is down the hill from the Itaewon subway station (actually a bit closer to the one after Itaewon that began with an ""h""), which allows you to fill an afternoon with both the museum and shops/food in Itaewon.
