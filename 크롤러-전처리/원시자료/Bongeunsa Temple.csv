0,5.0,Finding peace,"Although, due to Corona Virus, the temple grounds were almost empty, I came here for some inner peace and inspirations. This is one of my top three favorite temples in Seoul and I come here a lot - during all the seasons. This time, it was quiet and almost ghostly - like most of", March 2020
1,5.0,Buddhist Temple,One of the nicest and largest Buddhist Temples in Seoul.  It has many things for tourists but can get very crowded., July 2019
2,4.0,Ancient Temple in heart of high rise buildings.,"There are five main building structures, some of which are still being used for prayer.  The main statue is at the back of the entire complex - making it the highest structure in the temple compound", February 2020
3,5.0,Beautiful Buddhist temple,"The Bongeunsa Temple is a large, beautiful Buddhist temple located in the heart of bustling Seoul. By some accounts, it is perhaps the biggest Buddhist temple in Seoul. I saw it from the window of the hotel where I was staying during a recent visit and I decided to walk down. The temple complex consists of many buildings with one where the main shrine is located.", February 2020
4,5.0,A Piece of Quiet in the Middle of Seoul.,"The first impression when arriving at the train station and getting into the Bongeunsa Temple is one of doubt of a comfortable atmosphere. But to my pleasant surprise, once we entered the premises of the Bongeunsa Temple, everything changed.At the gate you pay a small fee to enter as historic and cultural attractions in Korea are facilitated with very affordable prices. Then you proceed to enter and on your left and right are the statues of Guarding Warriors, 4 to be precise, 2 on each side and each one has its own significance in the overall spiritual deal at the temple.Then you continue to enter as you will see a smiling Buddha on your left in the middle of a pond and on the right a simple, minimalist and exquisite cemetery.Finally you enter another big Pagoda Gate and voila you are in a square with several temple units to visit, front, left, right and on the hill. I do not recommend the ladies, high heels or something like that as there is a lot of antique steps along the way and you may have an unpleasant incident.Then the choice is yours. Please look at the pictures we uploaded for you and see it for yourselves. Finally you come to a square where there is a giant statue of what appears to be a female Buddha or deity surrounded by hundreds of small figures and statues 1 foot size each = 33+ cmts in height. All exquisitely and tastefully allocated in perfect order on a crescent shaped wall behind the great statue.This will bring the site tour to an end and from there you can take the steps and cross the street to visit the famous COEX Shopping Mall which can be seen across the street from the Bongeunsa Temple complex.", January 2020
5,4.0,A huge temple in Gangnam-gu,"This is perhaps the biggest Buddhist temple in Seoul. Good to visit together with Starfield COEX Mall.- The location is very close from Metro Line #9 Bongeunsa.- Unlike Jogyesa in Jongno, this is not that crowded.- A little bit of hills.- They run a templestay. It'll be good for those interested.- In November, many parents visit here to pray for children's exam.", January 2020
6,5.0,Unique and Beautiful Temple,"The Buddha Shrines are very impressive at this large temple site.  Lots of flowers, lanterns, and buildings.  We bought a roof tile and wrote a wish on it.", August 2019
7,5.0,Great place for photos and history,I was just went there a week ago in Seoul -- and a good place for photos.  They have volunteers who speak good English and so willing to tell you more of the temple's history (and you can arrange on a Temple Stay to experience life in a temple for a few hours)., December 2019
8,5.0,Found my peace,"I didn't know what I was expecting when the guide handed me a flyer with a map to the temple. We went around slowly and barely took any pictures because we knew they wouldn't do justice to how pretty the place was. All you could hear was mostly silence and the chirping of the birds, and the rustle of leaves, and footsteps full of purpose.I'd say the exposition leading up to the Buddha statue was perfect - the entire scene caught me completely off-guard and took my breath away. This, I realized, was peace.", December 2019
9,4.0,"Serene, good for a quick visit","This is a beautiful temple right in the middle of the city! Just across the road from COEX and Intercontinental, the temple is serene, quiet, and worthy of a visit - whether you have a few minutes or a few hours, there's enough to keep you occupied here!", November 2019
10,4.0,Nice temple stay experience!,"I did the overnight temple stay experience. I enjoyed it and really liked it. I feel peaceful after the experience. The program lectured you about the practice of Buddhism, history of the temple, and how to cultivate yourself. I would recommend this temple stay. Our Sunim was experienced, and kind. Would go back and enjoy the peace once more. Also, the Buddha statues were very beautiful and sight to see. About the food, we got vegetarian food----and it was great!!", July 2019
11,5.0,Beautiful place,The location is awesome. You feel like surreal when you are taking pictures. You see the temple and the big building behind, February 2019
12,5.0,Do the TempleStay Program here!,"Just finished the TempleStay program where you sleep overnight in one of the temples and have a series of planned activities with the monks. An amazing, once in a lifetime experience that I highly recommend. They squeeze so much into the short period you're there, so you really get so much experience for the small amount it costs. We didn't know anything about Buddhism or speak any Korean and we had absolutely no problems since they help you through the entire process. Hands down our favorite part of our trip to Korea.", December 2019
13,5.0,Gorgeous autumn foliage,The temple looks boring from the front. Walk further in towards the back and u will see a kind of little forest or park. The autumn foliage is simply gorgeous and out of this world. this place is an easy 500m walk from Coex Mall so u can easily combine this with a visit to Starfield Library and a meal in Coex Mall., November 2019

15,4.0,An Active Temple,The temple isn’t just a tourist attraction but an actual active one. There are monks and worshippers at the temple so it is a real authentic Korean experience and worth a visit. Though the temple is located right within the business area on Gangnam-gu it is nice and quiet and an opportunity to relax and wind down., November 2019
16,5.0,Nice quiet temple,This is an active temple with worshipers. The architecture is interesting and worth a visit. It will not take very long to visit the property., November 2019
17,5.0,Moving...,"this temple in the middle of the city across the Intercontinental COEX hotel, is amazing; you will be surprised by the calm and serenity of this place; take a walk around and feel the power of this place;", July 2019
18,4.0,Nice temple opposite COEX,"The temple is easily accessible by subway. It is located just across the road from COEX (where the aquarium is). Lovely temple with big Buddha statue. Just as I entered the temple, a magpie stopped in front of me. Did not miss the chance to take its photo. There is a small tea-shop for the visitors; from there one could just relax and view the city from its balcony.", October 2019
19,4.0,A quiet space across the street from the COEX,"Literally across the street from the massive convention centre is this place of peace and quiet surrounded by the city. Great history and architecture,nice walks in the woods. Current construction on the site distracts a little but it's still easy to find a quiet place to pray (for Buddhists) and a peaceful escape for everyone else.", November 2019
20,4.0,Quiet place next to Coex center,"This temple is just next to Coex center. It is at a hill side. Though next to busy business buildings, this place is surprisingly quiet. Few people came during the noon when I visited. There are a few buildings there and takes some climbing to see them. It is a good place if you want to escape from busy life around it for a while.", October 2019

24,4.0,Neat temple,"Stumbled on this the last day I was in Seoul. Right near the hotel, didn't even know it was here. You can walk around the temple and even stay at night if you'd like. It feels very calm and relaxing even though it is surrounded by city. Love the old and refurbished architecture.", October 2019
25,3.0,"Don't be annoying, watch out for construction","We stopped to take in some living culture - be aware, this is a practicing temple, people go there to pray and reflect, so bring your best behavior! I can't tell you how many noisy, annoying tourists we saw! For us, we simply walked the grounds, sat in the shade, and spoke quietly in whispers about the rituals and what we were experiencing. It seems as though the temple is undergoing a massive overhaul of their buildings and reorganization of the entry/grounds. Lots of orange cones, construction equipment, and scaffolding everywhere, but we'll probably go back on our next journey to see the completion.", October 2019
26,4.0,"If you're visiting just one temple in Seoul, make this the one","The statue, while not the largest that I've seen, is definitely quite inspiring to stand in front of and behold. And then you notice all the other ones surrounding it.This temple and complex might not seem like much from the start (construction in the front, by a major roadway and across from a convention center), but it's definitely worth a visit. Don't let the exterior fool you - it's a completely different experience once you start wandering within.Note that the exterior and parts of the complex are currently under construction. While the construction noise does detract a bit from the experience, honestly once you start walking through the complex you notice it less, largely because of the chanting that gets aired through the grounds.", October 2019
27,5.0,Temple in Middle of Crowded City,This is a temple complex in the middle of bustling Seoul. It is very beautiful and interesting to see and well worth a visit while near COEX., October 2019
28,5.0,Buddist temple in the heart of Gangnam,"I have been visited this temple because of a suggestion of a friend of mine. I have to say that you cannot be disappointed,there is a great integration into the skyline between heritage and new building, which is facinating. you can walk around the park for free and enjoy the beutiness of it. Be respectful with other people that are there to pray.", October 2019
29,5.0,Impressive place,Subway Line #9 stops nearby making it convenient to visit. The place is impressive with the 23 meter tall statue., September 2019
30,5.0,Unique experience on temple stay ,"A random decision to book 2D1N temple stay in Seoul.  It's a journey of learning & experience Korean Buddhist culture w open mind regardless of religion , background.  Friendly & humble coach , Sunims , yoga teacher sharing their experiences n stories. Will definitely make this as part of future trip to Korea", October 2019
31,5.0,"Wonderful temple, Perfect to combine with COEX center",Greets place to combine with a tour of COEX convention center and mall and see the famous Gangnam style sculpture right next to both. Better in the fall season but worth a visit yea round., October 2019

34,4.0,A Peaceful Oasi in Gangnam..,"Exactly at the exit of the Bongeunsa Temple Station (line 9).It's really a little piece of a peaceful oasi in the middle of Gangnam District.The entrance is beautiful: there are many lanterns, lotus flowers, and sculptures.It's a complex of temples with free admission, close to the COEX Mall.One of the most beautiful temples of Seoul!", August 2019
35,4.0,Old and New Juxtaposed ,"From Seoul Station, I took the subway and made a transfer to line 9, which has an exit right by the temple. It was very easy to find. The entry is beautiful with many white lanterns, flowers, and sculpture. Once inside the grounds, I enjoyed taking photos of the temple buildings with the modern skyscrapers in the background. It is such a stark contrast. It is very peaceful and I highly recommend this peaceful respite.", September 2019
36,5.0,Beautiful temple with great temple food,"To get to the temple from COEX, go to the end of the mall with PF Changs and other restaurants outside. Go up the stairs to street level and cross the road, then the temple complex is on your left a bit further along the road.If you want to eat at the temple, follow the walkway with decorations overhead up to the building and go into the office on the right where you can buy a ticket (which is only a few thousand won). If you then come back out the way you came and turn right, walk past the shop at the back of the car park to the other temple large building and enter through the front entrance. There is a box to put your ticket in and then follow the queue and you will be served the set meal which is vegan. The staff were very friendly, helpful and welcoming, as were the other diners.             Food is only served between 11:30-12:30 so make sure you time your visit well. The wider temple and grounds are very picturesque and are well worth some additional time before or afterwards to look around.", April 2019
37,5.0,Serene,A very calming and serene temple to visit. The temple was lit up with hundreds of white lantern that made it even more calming. The lotus flowers added to the aesthetic. We went a little late in the day but it looked like they had a nice hiking area which I am sure would be great to check out. I recommend going in the afternoon., July 2019
38,5.0,A peaceful respite in a commercial district,This temple is simply beautiful and peaceful. It is across the street from the huge coex shopping complex but within minutes you feel like you are in an isolated mountain temple. You are free to walk throughout the sprawling complex up to hillside hiking trails. Well worth spending a couple of hours there., July 2019
39,5.0,Two types of event for English speakers ,I walked by at the end of my vacation in korea. The temple was very beautiful and they offers classes(?) to experience Buddhism. I wish I knew about this earlier., July 2019
40,5.0,mesmerising,"since i'm a buddhist, i figured i should come down and take a look, even if you're not, the place is right opposite coex starfield mall - so might as well drop by here. it is situated on a mound, so expect to climb a bit of stairs or walk up the slopes. the buildings and decorations are beautiful, especially the lanterns. just walk around, breathing in the calm scenery around", June 2019
41,4.0,Nice Peaceful Place,"Although hardly a must see, this temple is a true oasis of tranquility and peace amidst busy streets of Gangnam. If you happen to be nearby don’t miss your chance to spend some time here.", June 2019
42,5.0,Peaceful and harmonious complex of Temples,Complex of small temples on a hillside opposite side of road to Coex conference centre and Coex Intercontinental Hotel. Beautiful displays of paper lanterns sponsored by worshippers. This is a large restoration site but done very sensitively to create a restful location in a busy city. Worth a visit as part of a Seoul trip., June 2019
43,5.0,A wonderful experience!,"We visited one afternoon in June 2019 by chance. We were mesmerised by the thousands of coloured lanterns, the intricate and beautiful painting of buildings and the amazing plaza with hundreds of statues around a massive Buddha. Despite being in the centre of town it was very peaceful and spiritual. And  amazingly it was free. Highly recommended.", June 2019
44,5.0,Sprawling Temple Complex,"We were only able to see a small portion of the temple grounds as it was spread out over a good sized forested area.  This was an unusual location as modern civilization has grown up around it.  It was unfortunate that most of the original temple buildings were destroyed over the years and had to be rebuilt.There was lots of parking available here should you happen to drive.  However public transport was still the best way to visit for us as it was close to many major sites such as the COEX Mall.The pathway leading to the temple was covered with colorful paper lanterns which seemed to be quite common.  The same paper lantern ""roof"" continued through the first gate until we arrived at the main temple building.  The main temple was large and intricately painted especially inside with the artwork surrounding the seated golden buddha statue. A short walk away from the temple led us to the Maitreya statue, which was a very tall representation of the future Buddha.  I believe it was considered one of the tallest in Korea.  It was located at the end of a wide plaza framed by a wall containing many miniature statues.  It was beautiful setting.There were various pathways and stairs that led further into the temple compound but due to time constraints and aching feet we did not get the chance to explore them.", June 2019
45,4.0,Buddhist Temple,"Worth the visit, the temple in the middle of city centre and just across the road to Coex Mall.Very big temple and also provide templestay for practicing meditation too.", June 2019
46,5.0,Very nice temple,"I was here around sunset and really enjoyed it. The temple looked great, as it was still decorated for Buddha's birthday. It was very quiet too, almost no one there.", May 2019
47,4.0,Thankful to be back!,Glad to have a chance to revisit this place and looking at those colourful lanterns with wishes hanging onto it. The chance to bath the buddha was also great!The temple seems to be undergoing renovation.A real short walking distance from the subway station which is good choice for the elderly., May 2019
48,5.0,A quick oasis in a bustling city,"The grounds were peaceful and beautiful. There was monks chanting during our exploring. There was also some construction going on. The tea was delicious.  There are a few templestay programs that are offered. You can visit most areas as long as you are quiet and respectful. It was well worth the visit. Even though many of it was newer and lots of concrete I find it didnt distract from the overall beauty. It was in the heart of a,war 60 years ago. Not being completely origonal is accetable to me. Since for many it is still a place of worship new construction also makes sense.", May 2019
49,3.0,"A nice tample, but not THAT nice.","Maybe I'm a bit spoiled by seeing so many of these, but I just wasn't impressed. The architecture is beautiful, yet forgettable. Nothing exceptionally unique here either. Also not impressed with how they fit it all together - that is, with the lack of any general plan, when you feel like it's one complex, and not just a set of separate buildings. Dusty footpaths everywhere instead of filling space with a garden is another problem, which seem to separate Korean temples from what I've seen in Japan. Overall, if you haven't been to a Buddhist temple before or only seen one or two, you may find it worth a visit. Otherwise, it's rather standard, even though still quite beautiful temple, with a moderately large territory to explore.", May 2019
50,5.0,Magical at night,"The place was illuminated, not least by the profusion of artistically painted (probably) paper models. And then we saw the beautiful circular arena at the top with the very large statue of Buddha surrounded by numerous statues and a much larger number of statuettes - a wow moment", May 2019
51,4.0,Serene and Peaceful,"Bongeunsa Temple offers a reprieve in the midst of the bustling metro. We planned to only for a few minutes but we ended up staying more than half an hour. Its grounds were well-maintained and it was very peaceful. It sort of reminds me of Nara, Japan. It has several temples and a big Buddha statue. A lantern festival was being held when we went there which made the place extra interesting. A must-visit if you’re in the area!", April 2019
52,3.0,Could be better,"If the place was better installed with no parking lot and respectful of this religious space, it could be better because the hill and the little forest are very nice in the centrum of Gangnam Gu", May 2019
53,4.0,Nice quick visit,"I had a nice, quick, visit to this temple. I happened to be there when there was a lantern festival happening, so it was extra beautiful. All I did was wonder around since there isn’t any real directions or guides (at least that I saw), but that was enough to see the beautiful grounds and temple. Close to subway and other attractions. Would recommend stopping by if you are nearby.", May 2019
54,4.0,Beautiful,Very quiet and peaceful place.  The painting on these building is amazing.  Within walking distance of several hotels., April 2019

57,4.0,Beautiful temple,The cherry blossoms were in full bloom when we went so it was picturesque. The colorful lanterns were both beautiful and touching because they all signified heartfelt prayers. It's right across Starfield Coex Mall., April 2019
58,5.0,Peaceful and happy,"I always visit Bongeunsa as it is near my house, and I like the peaceful vibe I get when visiting. Even though it is in the middle of the city, I feel like you can get away from the city just going to Bongeunsa. It looks pretty these days with the blossoms too. But go quick, before it’s too late. I went two weeks ago, and though there were not too many blossoms yet, it was beautiful. They have also opened up a cafe, which I enjoyed having traditional omija tea (my favorite) and a Korean cookie.", March 2019
59,5.0,free entrance to this temple with a giant statue,can accept temple stay in this templeno entrance feehas monks insidethey also have huge parking spaces, March 2019
60,5.0,Korean tea is a wonderful experience,Not a huge temple but a gorgeous one in the middle of city life! Wonderful old sculptures- my favorite Buddha loves here!, March 2019
61,4.0,Korean Temple,"Very easy access to the temple! The biggest plus of places outside of the city is that there are not so many visitors that makes these places gain a lot on the climate! One of the many temples so popular in Korea, with the here that we have preserved the atmosphere of this place", March 2019
62,4.0,Nice Buddhist temple,We visited this Buddhist temple while in Seoul. It took us about one hour to stroll through the various pavilions of the temple and to see the majestic Buddha statue. Interesting for those interesting in getting a glimpse of Korean Buddhism and those wishing to meditate., March 2019
63,5.0,Better than the palaces,"This temple has so much more to offer than the more popular spots in Seoul.Gyeongbokgung Palace was just... big, while the Temple was wonderfully ornate and less crowded. I am so glad I went there.", March 2019
64,4.0,Beautiful ,A very nice and old temple in the heart of Seoul. The entrance is free but you will be charged if you park there. The contrast between these very old temples and the new city is impressive.You will need about 30m to 1h to visit the place, March 2019
65,4.0,A little outside of town but a worthwhile visit,"Seoul is such a large city - you don't realise the scale of it until you get there and it is clear the maps don't really do it justice. We came here because we saw some awesome pictures online of the buddha with the backdrop of the skyscrapers of Gangnam. To get that shot there is a path up behind the Buddha - but you might have to rustle some bushes to get behind and take that shot. Apart from the Buddha, there isn't too much to see or read about. This is a real place of worship and is not really built to be a tourist destination!", December 2018
66,5.0,a genuine temple,It is quite spacious with a lot of worshippers. It is easily accessible in from of the COEX center and transportations stations., January 2019
67,4.0,Past meets Present,This Buddhist temple is located in Gangnam district just across CoEx. It's a good example of an old structure meets modern buildings. The temple offers temple stay wherein foreigners can understand and experience what monks do in their daily lives. Nice place to visit and appreciate the structures and surroundings because its not often you can see something like this., December 2018
68,5.0,Serene temple,A bit of peace and calm in a bustling city. Good to have a stroll through the temple and have some time to reflect. Our favourite temple that we visited in Seoul., November 2018

70,5.0,Amazing place,"Bongeunsa is an amazing place: a large temple complex that sits across the street from a busy shopping mall-hotel complex, and which is surrounded by tall buildings of the new town. The grounds have several old, traditional temple buildings, as well as a semi-circular open-air plaza with a tall statue of Maitreya, that we could see from our hotel. The main temple hall is beautifully decorated with lotus shaped lanterns and wood paintings. The temple is in active use and one sees locals performing prayers - very serene and peaceful experience.", January 2019
71,4.0,Quiet temple inside of a busy city,It’s hard to believe that there is a small quiet temple nestled between tall city buildings. Bongeunsa Temple offered a quiet place to visit. There are prayers held there daily so visitors should be mindful., December 2018
72,5.0,Recommended,"Just opposite COEX shopping mall, this temple is another attraction of it’s own. Take more time to visit all the temple halls and the main attraction is tall Buddha and a open air area surrounded in a forest where devotees meditate and pray.", December 2018
73,5.0,Experience Peaceful and Reflective Moments in Bustling Seoul,"You are an early riser tourist and looking for something to do. I would recommend Bongeunsa Temple which is located next to COEX Mall. It is being described as a millennial Buddhist temple that commands a rich history of over 1,200 years. Understand that they are opened at 3am and closes around 1000pm. No entrance fee at all.Boungeunsa Temple is a peaceful retreat that is nestled in the heart of one of the busiest location in Seoul. When you set foot at the entrance, it transports you into a distinctively different world. As foreigner, you can participate in the “templestay program” in experiencing traditional Korean Buddhist culture and practices.The location is easily accessible by public transport. There is an exit directly outside the temple. Most of the halls are well layout on forested hillside. The library is the oldest remaining building in the compound.

74,4.0,Serene temple,I reckon it's worth a visit especially if you're around gangnam area. The temple is open for free to all...even to Non-Buddhist.

Attent a session in the temple during prayers (very respectfully) and attent a drawing a drawing sessions that learnt you to meditateby focusing on drawing korean writing and a tea ceremony wit the same goal. The conversation with one of the monks was relaxing in itself. I had expected a full meditation session under guidance, but this was well compensated.

117,4.0,Unique Temple Experience,"Having explored many temples in South Korea, Bongeunsa Temple has its own unique glamour. I took a walk through in the late afternoon (4pm) once the temperature dropped and it was quite crowded. There was an unexpected traditional Korean drumming performance at 5:30pm. It was very loud and could be heard throughout the temple. I would definitely recommend wearing comfortable shoes because this temple is currently under construction and there is a lot of rubble and rocks on the roads. I loved the beauty of the forest hidden behind the temples. The trees were vivid green and the air was so fresh and crisp. It was certainly an amazing break from the hectic pace of life in the city of Gangnam. Due to the reconstruction, I don't believe there is a charge for admission to get into the temple which was great. 1-2 hours was certainly more than enough time to visit the temple. I would recommend anyone visiting Gangnam to visit this beautiful Buddhist monument, if time allows.", May 2018

But still, well worth a little stop off to see the beautiful architecture.", May 2018

The entrance to these halls were on the side and not in the front. There were monks chanting which made the atmosphere soothing and one felt calm with lovely vibrations. One can make previous bookings and choose to spend a day there.  There is clean accommodation The Big Buddha statue was impressive In spite of constructions on the place was well maintained. There were lovely trees with yellow flowers and I saw my first glimpse of a cherry blossom tree . Some photographers wee enthusiastically taking photos of the much popular cherry blossom flowers. I would visit this again to see how much more beautiful it is after reconstruction ❤️, May 2018

My friend went here to eat vegetarian meals (which are hard to find in Korea), and I came here to mediate and walk around like an old man. I'd often sit BEHIND the statue and watch the people come and pray. It sounds weird but I loved making up stories for everyone as they passed haha. Now that I actually am an older man (before I was 22), I came back with a filming crew to show them this amazing spot and the crazy juxtaposition of the city and the temple. They loved it too.

Temple is at mountain and to get there you need few changes of metro and walk and catch a bus- if you go alone. Better to have someone who can speak korean, because when you get at bus stop - you need to ask which one goes to temple and which one goes down - there is only one bus stop for both ways. Near bus stop i didnt see any youngsters and old people definitely dont speak english. Going backt to temple! Really really nice pagodas, arhitecture is worth to see, mountain and pease around- worth to feel. Even if youre lucky- you can hear birth singing. When you reach destinations - main temple place, you will see many people in there. Probably half of them is for prayer, half as a tourist and some of them also stay at temple.

The people are welcoming even if you are not familiar with the rituals. The entire grounds are decorated with colorful ribbons and paper lanterns.

The grounds are beautiful and you'll forget you are across the street from a convention center.We spent about 1 hour walking the grounds. It was fairly romantic with the snow covered trees actually. It was great to just walk across the street from meetings and a busy shopping area to relax in the temple. Recommend more as a respite from a hectic day rather than a must see spot. If you are at the convention center, take the time to go.", February 2017

You can enjoy some old fashioned Korean Buddhist temple architectures and some quiet moods from religious faculties. They have big statue of Buddha (Maitreya). And all those old fashioned architecture and statue are mostly from modern times within 50yrs from now on. (Though the temple built almost 1,000yrs ago most of original buildings were burnt over fires). So the temple is not the kind of destination you should be, but worth visiting for short break, if you stay near to this temple.", April 2017

There was the sound of prayers echoing throughout the grounds and we sat by the enormous statue at the very back of the temple. The light along the walls reflected on the marble floor and made it look like water and the drifting sounds of the chants made for one of the best experiences I had in Seoul. I just wish people (tourists) were more respectful! It clearly said no photos all throughout the temple however some people had their cameras right in front of people that were praying,", September 2016

210,4.0,"Beautiful overhead paper lanterns to the great ""standing Buddha""","""Quite mesmerizing"" was the sight of these rows of beautiful white paper lanterns overhead stretching from the entrance gate all the way to the first temple building raised up on concrete pillars, and more white paper lanterns along with red ones are to be seen in that building & the one right behind (pretty much connected to the first building) on the way to the inner temple grounds where all the way at the back is a great ""standing Buddha"" with a square-plate hat (a pretty ""unique"" design of a Buddha statue really!) on a pedestal with also big carved sculptures around its base.  Some views of the city from near the big Buddha (which is on somewhat of a high ground) are alright too although there's not much of a skyline to speak of in this area pretty far to the south of the city (across the wide Han River) from the hustle & bustle of the downtown area in the north in the vicinity of the palaces.  And yes, what's ""really great"" about this temple is that it stays open late; I only arrived at pretty close to 6 pm and they were still open (temples in Japan for example, from my experience, all close at about 5 pm) although a monk was hitting a gong or something inside a temple building at about 6 20 pm which I'm not sure was a signal for closing.Coming by subway, the nearest station is Bongeunsa Station (the same name as this temple) on Line 9, and it's a mere 3-minute-or-so walk to the temple entrance gate (with its four big guard statues) after getting out of the station.", June 2016

It's not quite as ""romantic"" as one might hope.Nevertheless, it makes for an interesting visit, especially if you also cross the road to compare it with the COEX convention centre, a temple of another kind:  to globalisation and commerce.To get there take the metro to Bongeunsa station and follow the signs.", November 2016

Once you are inside, you will see many people praying & meditating inside.On my first visit, an old man told me not to miss the lunch because it is only 1000 Won but I already had lunch.  My second trip, we just missed the lunch. We went there again the next day at 11.30am and there was a queue of hundreds of mostly old people.

You can get there by car taxi or subway(any station near COEX) Thankfully it's not on a mountain as many Korean temples are. There main building has some beautiful features inside including religious statues. There are a number of buildings around the complex and I have no idea/don't remember what they were for but they were architecturally similar to just about every temple in Korea. Frankly, with the exception of a few, most temples in Korea look exactly the same. This one is surrounded by skyscrapers and the largest indoor mall in Asia. As a resident of the area it's a peaceful escape.  There is a huge buddha statue towards the back and many historic and architectural features around the complex. Please keep in mind, you'll be on temple grounds, be respectful and quiet. You can go nuts with your camera. There are some temple activities like temple stay but I have no interest in those so can't comment. There are many places to eat nearby especially in the mall. I personally like to go to Brooklyn Burger, which is a few blocks away, for some of the best burgers in Seoul. I highly recommend a visit if you're in the area.

I opted not to get a tour guide because my intention was some silent reflection. There was a ""service"" going on when I visited.  There was a prayer leader leading a group of practitioners in song and meditation.  The music/singing  could be heard throughout the temple grounds but it did not preclude silent reflection as the music was conducive to it.  There were many people tendingto the gardens and ponds when I was there.  I do not know if this is a daily thing or just a coincidence.  The grounds are very well kept.  Some of the trees looked really old.  The pond with the lotus flowers was lovely.  They don't mind tourists taking pictures as long as this is done quietly and unobtrusively.

I was very interested to visit the Bonguensa Temple as I love to visit the religious places of different religions and country. I like to see how in other countries the Lord is worshipped. Hence, I decided to visit this place which was very near to the COEX Mall. My colleagues chose to keep visiting the mall. The moment I stepped into this place it was very calm and a divine feel was coming. In the entrance there were lotus plants every where and the God was also being offered Lotus. The local people were buying grains and other things to offer the God. I went there in the evening and that time the monk was offering the prayers and then he rang the big bell. The sound of it was giving peace to me. I saw how the locals are offering prayers and then did the same way. In the premises of the temple there was a garden, a place where the monks stay, a very big statue of the Gautam Buddha and there was a Goddess also who was resembling our Indian Godess. The place was very beautiful and calm. A must visit if you are around the place.", July 2016

281,4.0,Worth Visiting While in Seoul,"If you are in the vicinity of COEX in Seoul, I highly recommend visiting the nearby Bongeunsa Temple, located across from the main COEX convention center and conveniently located off the metro line 9 stop with the same name.  I visited on a Sunday morning and the place was full of worshippers.  While I did not enter any of the buildings where the services were taking place, it was nice to hear the drums and chants of the people at these services as I wandered around and took pictures. The architecture and paintings on the buildings were interesting and there was information in various languages, to include English.  They offer temple stays if you are in to things like that.  There also is a large out door central area with a big statue and cushions where one can pay their own respects.  It was very peaceful and beautiful.  Altogether I am very happy I visited and would recommend visitors to Seoul check it out, especially if attending something or shopping/eating/going to the aquarium at the nearby COEX.  About an hour is sufficient to view the complex, more if you sit and soak in the atmosphere.", July 2016
282,5.0,No time for tourism; a quick special place to visit when at convention center (Coex),"I was at a meeting at the Coex convention center. Except for my morning run (and Korean women apparently don't run, at least in Seoul, so I was quite out of place). I was there for work and had very little spare time. My best experience was running (okay, I walked at that point) through the Bongeunsa Temple which borders the convention center. Beautiful, peaceful, monks strolling temple grounds, chanting, the real deal: no one spoke any English! Recommended for a business traveler who wants a taste of Korea, with limited time.", June 2016
283,3.0,A welcome respite in a busy city,"Visited Bongeunsa whilst attending a conference at COEX across the road. A welcoem respite to the activity of the conference.When I visited the way into the temple was between a path of water lilies in large barrels up to the first Hall - and as this is a working Bhuddist temple the hall was full of devotees chanting as where the other halls around the site. The different halls are architectural Korean buildings in their own right with highly decorated exteriors and interiors. There were lots of messages for the Gods hanging like an upside down carpet between some of the buildings, incense and shops to buy food for the Gods.There is also a bell and large drum pavilions, a large open air statue and if you wish to do so you can book to stay here and experience the life of a monk. An hour or so will allow to enjoy the pleasures of this temple", June 2016

Bongeunsa Temple is situated very close to Gangnam, right across the street from the COEX Mall, and just a few blocks walk from the Park Hyatt, where I was staying. The temple staff are very polite, and I was treated to a wonderful volunteer led tour of the temple grounds with other English speaking tourists.
