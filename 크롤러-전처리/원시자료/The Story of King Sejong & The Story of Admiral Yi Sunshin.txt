0,4.0,Total surprise,"While in the square, I was looking for a bathroom.  Behind one of the statues was a door.  Hmmm.  Bathroom, perhaps?  Yes... and much more.  What a great (and free) museum of early Korean history and culture.  Great also to warm up when its cold outside... and they have", November 2019
1,5.0,Interesting museum and small hands on activities,"After visiting GyeongbukongPalace, this museum is across the street. You will notice it because of the large statue of King Sejong and Admiral Yi opposite from each other.  The museums are below street level and are connected to one another.  Here you can learn about the Korean alphabet and writing as well as the war history. There are small activity tables where you can do many activities such as standing and learning Korean calligraphy.  There is no charge for this Museum.", June 2019

3,5.0,A lovely little underground find!,We saw the two statues and decided to explore further.  Lovely little find - on our way to Gyeongbukgong Palace  - all underground - and a great experience to learn more about Seoul's history.  A great surprise and really fascinating!, April 2019
4,5.0,Experiential learning of history at its Best,"Walking back from the Gyeongbukgong Palace towards the Cheonggyecheon stream, we chanced upon this two statues in the middle of the busy street. When we went near, it led us to the discovery of an underground museum. A gem for anyone who wants to learn the history of King Sejon, families and kids joined the activities. I found the second part of the museum on Admiral Yi SunShin fascinating as actual artifacts are displayed together with his story of bravery and innovation in ancient war fare - all in both Korean and English. There is even a 3D theatre with fixed times for an about 12 min show.", September 2018
5,5.0,Seoul is awesome and this underground museum was an unexpected but delightful surprise!,"My fellow flight attendant and I decided to hop over to Korea for the first time and I’m so pleased we did!  As a New Yorker I could really appreciate the bustling crowds and the contrast of natural beauty, with historical architecture at every bend. We decided to visit the King’s monument after meandering about Gyeongbokgung Palace and I was absolutely delighted! Not only could we escape the heat but there were all sorts of lovely exhibits and a really cool interactive sundial display... we took photos on some of these fantastic benches made from words but we have no idea what they say! If anyone knows please find me on IG @ KolaCares and say hi lol. Can’t wait to go back- I pray for peace in politics because this lovely, civilized city deserves to be preserved (just beware the “disregard” for lack of personal space lol, Korean certainly do crowd too much.)", September 2018

The underground museum, telling of the king's life and works, are here and access is free.", May 2018

You can see and hear about great Korean history, General Yi and King Sejong. 4D Cinema is also free, after that you can write your name in Korean letter by traditional way.

11,4.0,Very well made underground museums,We went down just for the King Sejong's museum but Admiral Yi's museum was also there. That was awesome! I prefer Admiral Yi place than Sejong's.

14,3.0,More for Koreans,"These two are very important people in Korean history but if you are not a history buff walking through show cases of their writings that are all in Korean doesn't click.

15,5.0,Facinating,What a fascinating piece of Korean history! Deep below his statue in the heart of the city is a very well curated history of this wonderful leader and the story of how he developed a new language for his people. Experience such as this one are why we travel!, December 2016
