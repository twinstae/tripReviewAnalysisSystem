1,4.0,Seoulleung & Jeonneung Royal Tomb,"A beautiful UNESCO designated historical royal tomb area in the heart of Seoul not too far from Gangnam.  It is an impressive and well maintain area which is the final resting place for two Joseon Kings and one queen.  The grave mounds adhere to strict Confucian burial rites.  It is hard to believe that there is such a serene and peaceful area surrounded by office towers in the distance.  It is hard to imagine that this royal tomb area is only 20% of what the actual grounds were. There was a nominal admission charge,", November 2019

5,5.0,Magnificent tomb,The tomb is located in the middle of Gangnam area so it is very easy to visit if you are happen to stay in one of the many hotels within the territory.  It covers a very vast and hilly area so you better wear convenient shoes if you plan to visit it., October 2018

8,5.0,Nice quiet park,"This was a nice way to spend a couple hours. Very cheap to get in (1,000 won). They provide you with an English brochure. Tombs aren’t terribly exciting but the park itself is beautiful and it is hard to believe it is in the middle of the city. If you are nearby, you should stop and visit.", May 2019
9,5.0,ROYAL TOMBS,"It was autumn when we went to the Royal tombs, there were 8 tombs in form of hills.  A peaceful place to visit.", November 2018
10,5.0,Lovely park with interesting historical royal tombs ,"The tombs were a five minute walk from my hotel. I went around 0800 on a weekday and there were a lot of elderly Koreans getting in their morning excercise. The tombs were very interesting with stone guards at the top of the mound. You can only walk to the top of two of these and view from the side at the top but that is adequate . The entrance fee is $1000korean won, which is very cheap. I took the time to walk around the park and it was lovely. There was a very very old ginkgo tree, lots of cranberry and persimmon trees which were in fruit when I went. Beautiful Japanese maple were red with autumnal leaves. There were heaps of birds and I got to see a wild pheasant . A peaceful beautiful place to visit when in seoul", November 2018

14,5.0,Joseon Royal Tombs,"My husband and I visited the Royal Tombs of King Seongjong, Queen Jeonghyeon and King Jungjong. It was fascinating history learning about this royal burial site which is one of many around Seoul. The walk has hills and I recommend walking shoes as it’s gravel surface. Visit the History centre to see how the burial mound was formed and the coffin lowered into the ground and into a chamber. I would recommend this UNESCO World Heritage sure as a must see.", September 2018
15,4.0,Quiet spot on Sunday afternoon ,"I didn’t think it was possible to have such a large place to myself.  I visited at around 1830 on a Sunday afternoon.  It’s surprising to have such a vast forested area in the center of such a large metropolis.  It was a great place to go on a walk and imagine a time before skyscrapers.Seolleung station orange line exit 9.  Cost is 1,000W.", August 2018
16,5.0,Loved it,"I was just there yesterday as it was only a 5 minute walk from my hotel L7 Gangnam. I went for a nature walk and absolutely loved it. It's easy to walk and there are plenty of benches around for those who want to take a break. It was so green and pretty..almost felt as if walking in a forest. I went to 2 out of the 3 tombs, and liked the Korean traditional hanok houses but was really impressed more with the nature. I could believe such a peaceful place exists in Gangnam. It was so refreshing to take a walk and ponder. Would love to come back in the fall.", June 2018
17,5.0,Take a Break,Of course it s an Historical siteWith the Tombs of King and Queen But it s a nice park really inside Gangnam areaSo it s perfect to breath and relaxLove it, May 2018
18,3.0,Nice enough but nothing special,"Only 1000w to enter and it is a nice area to walk around but there is very little information in English about the tombs and the kings and queens that are buried here. There are toilets on site but not other facilities inside. Plenty of restaurants, coffee shops and convenience stores right outside.Overall, a nice place to take a stroll, but shouldnt be a priority on a visit to Seoul.", May 2018
19,5.0,History & Nature in the Heart of Gangnam,"This is a UNESCO site that is a bargain for the W1,000 you pay to gain entry.  A breath of fresh air and green space in the gleaming, sterile district of Gangnam, it's a good place to catch a mix of history and nature amidst one of Seoul's most glitzy areas.There are three tombs dating to the early Joseon dynasty and several nice walking paths between.  The small museum on the site has very little translated into any languages other than Korean, but the site and its paths alone make a visit worthwhile.  Very calming.", April 2018
20,4.0,Nice walk during a cold afternoon in Cherry blossom,It's a relaxing and beautiful area. Just enough in size to cover in a hour.Tombs are well preserved and the shirnes pretty and well restored.Nice haven in the middle of Gagnam-gu, April 2018
21,4.0,Joseon Royal Tombs,"Great visit for about USD $1 or W1,000 takes about an hour, light walking great for  meditating not very busy I went on  Sunday light tourist and local public. Grate to buy a drink or coffe before coming into the park, food is not allowed. Very peaceful and near the Bongeunsa Temple about 15 minute walk. Definetly worth the trip if you're near the area. If your hungry they have many good and beverage options right in front the main entrance.", March 2018
22,4.0,Easily toured on your own,"Located about a 15 minute walk from the COEX convention center, this UNESCO site is easily toured on your own, and a nice oasis in the middle of the city. Only 1000 won ($1 US approx) to enter, you're provided a map with walking paths - most are dirt and there are hills so wear good walking shoes. There's a clean restroom inside near the entrance gate. Each royal burial mound has a fence around it so you can't get really close but the statues and mounds are visible enough. I spent about 30 minutes here but could have spent more (it was frigid and windy the day I visited!).", December 2017
23,4.0,UNESCO World Heritage Site in the middle of the cityscape,"On our last day, we visited this unique World Unesco Heritage Site about 20minutes walk from COEX. This site consists of three tombs of two emperors and an empress from the Joseon dynasty.This site is unlike the relatively inaccessible Qing tombs near Beijing: you could not access the interior of the tombs nor walk near it (except a small restricted potion at the empress tomb).The location of the tombs with the juxtaposition of cityscape around them made this site unique. With the autumn foliage around us, it made for a refreshing walk in the morning. Have a look at the video presentation near the toilets at the entrance to have a better appreciation of the construction of the tombs.", November 2017
24,5.0,Not so touristy and peaceful,"My family wanted to visit the main Gangnam district at night and we had some time to burn.  We looked up some areas to visit near Gangnam station and this popped up.  One station away from Gangnam station, get off at Seollong station. A few minutes walk is a massive park with lots of walking trails.  The main attractions were the 3 burial sites for 2 kings and a queen but inside, you can catch beautiful foliage, some traditional structures and get some excercise.The park also wasn't at all touristy.  Apart from a few Europeans, we were the only foreigners there.  Most people visiting were olides going for some walking and talking with friends.If you want to learn some history and enjoy some less touristy spots in Seoul while still sight seeing, definitely give this place a visit.", November 2017
25,4.0,Small-scale royal tombs,"It was about 20-minute walk from Seolleung subway station in Gangnam area.  We reserved a walking tour from 'Visit Seoul.Net' website and the tour was free of charge.  The guide met us at the ticket booth of Seonjeongneung (meaning Seolleung and Jeongneung).After we bought our tickets, the guide toured us through the royal tombs of King Seongjong (the 9th king of the Joseon Dynasty), Queen Jeonghyeon (the second wife of King Seongjong) and King Jungjong (son of the two).  The tombs and surrounding statues were fenced off from visitors so we could not go near.  Seonjeongneung, together with burial grounds of other Joseon Kings and Queens have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.  It was more like a quiet park in the busy Gangnam city and the tombs were of rather small-scale for kings and queen. Still it was worth visiting.", October 2017
26,3.0,Park with history,"The park has 2 kings and one queen burial grounds. It is a nice place to walk in Seoul also best visited when the cherry blossom usually begins to bloom. the seen is very romantic. The walk effort is moderate, suitable for all ages.", April 2017
27,5.0,History in the middle of the city,"This was the first place I visited in Seoul, it was AMAZING! The entrance is very cheap and it's a huge land where you can walk around for hours between trees and beautiful buildings. Downer is that you cannot approach the tombs, where the statues are, but it's very peaceful and you can see enough from the barriers.", August 2017
28,4.0,A peaceful oasis in Seoul,"This cultural landmark is a green, peaceful place for an historic stroll in the busy Gangnam area.  Allow an hour to walk and see the monuments and burial mounds.  The grounds are well maintained and the staff is helpful.  The entry fee is modest.  Be sure to approach from the correct side with the entrance gate -- it is a long walk around otherwise, and the location of the gate is not obvious on some maps.  I visited early Saturday morning, and there were only a few other visitors.  It's not a great photo op, but a nice thing to do if you are on a business trip and have a couple of free hours.", June 2017
29,4.0,Tombs ,"Not much to see inside. Good for a walk and take some pictures. Entrance is 1,000 KRW. UNESCO site..", December 2016
30,4.0,Worth a visit,Several burial mounds of two kings and a queen of the Joseon era.Quite scenic and worth the walk. Located in Gangnam., October 2016
31,4.0,A peaceful oasis of nature and culture,"We wanted to go already for some time, but the tombs are a bit far from our usual hangout places in Seoul. Despite that, the tombs are easily accessible either by subway (Seolleung station - both yellow and green lines) or bus.There's a KRW 1000 entrance fee, and the whole complex is secluded. It feels like an island of fresh and pure air in middle of the bustling city, and it is very well maintained.There are three tombs to see, an impressive forest (there's a 500 yo ginkgo tree) and plenty of small animals - birds, squirrels, woodpeckers, grouses.The whole complex is a UNESCO World Heritage.", April 2016
32,4.0,Worth it!,"This is worth the 1000 Won (less than $1) to go in and walk around. It's lovely, even in winter, and there are nice trails to walk around the burial mounds. There's a video to watch (with English explanations) that was very helpful in understanding how the mounds are made and how it all works, so be sure to stop in the History Center to watch it!", February 2016
33,3.0,UNESCO site but nothing much to see inside,"Being in winter month, I enjoyed the cool air, peace and quiet in this heritage site. But other than that, there's nothing much to see. Admittedly, entrance fee is cheap at 1,000won. The museum on the right of the entrance is worth a visit before you start touring the grounds as it give you insight to the complicated architectural foundation lay at the tomb. What we see in pictures is only a tip of the iceberg. The underground foundation is amazing! To me, that's the highlight of the place. The Seongjongneung was being cornered off as maintainence is underway. You can't even get a glimpse of the royal tomb of King Seongjong. Frankly, I felt abit cheated. Fortunately, one still get to walk up to the  Royal tomb of queen Jeonghyeon. As respect, we can't really get close to the tomb but being able to at least see the tomb is frankly all I'm asking for. Think there are nicer UNESCO sites in the city so unless you are in the area, don't bother.", January 2016
34,2.0,It's interesting but can't see anything ,"Out of respect the tombs are fenced off/ closed off from the public, but if you feel like going for a bit of a walk in the park for 1000won and you have time to spare go for it. Otherwise the brochure itself will give you better photos than you can take in real life. If you have other items on your itinerary this definitely should not take priority.", February 2016
35,4.0,This place inside the city? LOL. But WOW!,"DATE VISITED: November 15, 2014PROS: Went here for a check, but somehow enjoyed my walk. The people running this place were very friendly & helpful. Some locals went here for a walk and jog. Cool place for a visit.CONS: This should've been free for public. Just like Bongeunsa Temple which is free to the public.LOCATION: 5/5PRICE: 4/5HOSPITALITY: 5/5ATTRACTIONS: 3/5", November 2015
36,4.0,This is the tomb of King Sungjong,"It is quite interesting tha King Sungjong was really hot man. He worked very hard to manage the nation in day time, but enjoyed night time entertainment very much with his brother. I think he really enjoyed his life. The places around the tomb is currently also famous for enjoyable entertainments~ ^^ Is it a round wheel of history? However, his last life was not so good. He was suspected to die with a complication of diabetes. And his son became a tyrant. Yeah, it is an authentic place to go~ And can enjoy Seoul's warm sky~ It will be better in autumn~", October 2015
37,4.0,Well Worth a Visit,"Another UNESCO World Heritage site in Seoul.  Well worth a visit; and photo op.  Also, just a nice park to stroll around on good weather day.", October 2015
38,5.0,Silence Within The Busy City,"The Seonjeongneung tombs were easy to find from the metro station. A small entrance fee gets you into the site where the tombs are, tall buildings surround the park and it is so peacefull, a great escape from the busy city. You can't get too close to the tombs but you can see the statues that are on top of it.", April 2015
39,5.0,Truly awesome - don't miss it!,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I made the journey via subway from Euljiro 1ga to this World Heritage listed site but was incredibly glad I made the trip. There are three royal tombs here and each one allows you to appreciate a different aspect of these massive structures. The sheer size of the earthen burial mounds and the impressive statues atop each tomb are awesome to see up close. There is no English information in the History Hall within the grounds but the English language brochure gives plenty of information about what you are seeing. If you have enjoyed learning about the Joseon dynasty in Seoul's museums and palaces, the tombs will be an enjoyable addition to your itinerary. It is quite easy to find one you get to Seolleung station and is a fascinating place to spend an hour wandering around.", July 2015
40,4.0,Good exposure to history,"Collectively, the Royal Tombs are listed as UNESCO sites. This is located in the heart of Seoul and provides a good example of single style tombs. At about $1- worth the experience.", July 2015
41,3.0,"Nothing to see here, move along...","Think of this as a nature preserve in the middle of the city rather than a tourist attraction.  If you are looking for a peaceful stroll along well maintained and wooded paths with lots of different types of birds, then this is your park.  However if you are looking to see the burial tombs and learn some Korea history, this is not your best option.", April 2015
42,4.0,Respect,"Heard about this park near my hotel in yeoksam. Thought it might be a nice place to go for a run. Not that kind of ""park"". I don't run through burial grounds. But an intriguing place to walk. Enjoyed the spirit stairs and spirit walkway that were off limits to visitors. Seems there were many birds on the property and the congregated near the burial grounds. Overall a fine experience. It is open until 8 pm. Think it might be interesting after dark but have yet to visit after sunset.", March 2015
43,4.0,Refreshing walk in the middle of Gangnam,"Seonjeongneung Park is located in one of the busiest area of Seoul, and still, while visiting it you may get the feeling you are in a quiet forest, a green oasis. This is a refreshing stop between COEX and Seollung area. The park itself displays tombs and relics of Joseon dynasty, with a few traditional Korean buildings. If limited in time, I would not go there on purpose, but if around, I would definitively stop again as a break. Small entrance fee.", January 2015
44,4.0,A quick and green getaway from surrounding Gangnam area,"A green area located in the middle of chaotic business district of Gangnam, containing the tombs of the 9th and 11th kings and one of the queens of the Joseon Dynasty. It serves as a peaceful and quick getaway location for the people working or living in the surrounding area which is full of plazas. Inside the green area, all the tombs have exactly the same setting and seeing any one of them is almost identical to seeing all. A spiked gate, then a T-shaped shrine and in an adjacent hill, the grave inside a mound and the statues of civil and military officials standing in front of the mound. It is worth a visit since admission fee is low and the park is beautiful and peaceful.", October 2014
45,5.0,Out of nowhere!,"Went out on a Geocache journey and found 3 near this area!! If it wasn't for that , I would not have found this great historic place! As of September 2014, the fee was 1,000won and well worth it! make sure you have enough time to visit all three tombs and to learn about them! Ensure you have the right clothes to wear because you will be walking on dirt. I came here at 6AM right when they opened and found that lots of people jog and walk around here for exercise!", September 2014
46,3.0,Seoul is a city with interesting food,"Have a good time there but hotel is a bit expensive. Seoul is considered a leading and rising global city, resulting from an economic boom called the Miracle on the Han River which transformed it from the ashes of the Korean War to the world's 4th largest metropolitan economy with a GDP of US$774 billion[14] in 2012 after Tokyo, New York City and Los Angeles. A world leading technology hub centered around Gangnam and Digital Media City,[15] it boasts the world's sixth largest[16] number of Fortune Global 500 multinationals such as Samsung, the world's largest technology company, as well as LG and Hyundai-Kia. In 2012, the city's GDP per capita (PPP) of $39,448 was comparable to that of Germany and Sweden. Ranked sixth in the Global Power City Index and seventh in the Global Financial Centres Index, the metropolis exerts a major influence in global affairs as one of the five leading hosts of global conferences.[17]", September 2013
47,3.0,Escape from the hustle and bustle,"Good for walks and somewhat of an escape from concrete structures (even though they're in the background) given that lush greenery conquers the space. After paying the admission fee of KRW1,000, do get a map that'll explain the sites to see before wandering off. Do note that some of the stairs are not meant for walking as they are for 'spirits'.  The park is just a short walk from Seoulleung Station exit 8 and there are signs to guide you. I went there around 9am though so there weren't too many people around...not too sure if it does get crowded in the afternoon or evenings.", July 2014
48,4.0,A nice diversion from the busy city,"There are a few things I liked about this attraction. It was only 1000 won and it was walking distance to the Intercontinental Coex where I was staying. What I liked best though was at the center of the site all you could see were trees, plants and birds. Unfortunately the tombs are on the edges of the site so some of the serenity is lost when you hear the cars and see the tall buildings (see pictures). Regardless it's interesting and nice to know that the history has been preserved.You can get a decent view of two of the tombs and a handful of buildings but for the third tomb there isn't a good vantage point. They have brochures in English which was nice because very few of the signs are in English. I'm not sure how large the entire site is but it was definitely a good way to stretch your legs in the city while learning about the Korean Joseon Dynasty that lasted over 500 years.", July 2014
49,3.0,Quite and tranquile but nothing special,"In a city like Seoul every little place that has nature and tranquility is special I guess. But I, as someone who is used to nature, did not think this place was special at all. The price to get in is very cheap and if you want to get away from the hectic way in Gangnam do go here. However, if you have ever been in a park or burial ground this place is not special at all.", May 2014
50,4.0,World Heritage Site within walking distance from Coex Mall,"Jeongnung is the royal tomb of King Jungjong which is in the same grounds as Seollung (the royal tomb of King Seongjong and Queen Jeonghyeon) and thus visited together. Collectively they are called ""Seonjeongneung"". These three well-preserved royal tombs in the Gangnam district were included in the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage list in 2009 and makes for a very good visit in the Coex Mall area. Admission costs KRW1000 (~USD1) and gains access to all tombs. The attraction is closed on Mondays, and opening times are early (6 or 630am) til 8pm. A few minutes from the entrance, there is a building which houses an introduction center for the site. Most of the text is in Korean, but there are excellent animation videos which show how the tombs were constructed in the 15th and 16th century. Unfortunately there is no English information for foreigners to know more about the Kings and Queen who were buried here, but there is an English brochure which makes up for this lack. There is also a postcard available here which gives a view of Seollung from the back, closer to the tomb (note the tombs can only viewed from the side). The royal tombs are on very high mounds; with Jeongnung, the stone sculptures can only be partially seen from ground level. With Seollung one can walk up to the level of the tombs but as mentioned they are viewed from the side. At the foot of the Kings' burial mounds are sacrificial buildings with simple interiors and there are two stone paths leading from the red gate. Avoid stepping on the spirit path and spirit steps as these are considered sacred.  What was lovely about this attraction is the wooded area between Jeongnung and Seollung which offered a very pleasant stroll through lush greenery. These tombs might be similar to other royal tombs which are found in other locations in Korea (also inscribed in the World Heritage list), and may feel repetitive to some. However for first timers, Seonjeongnung makes for a very good, interesting and easy attraction to visit. Other attractions enjoyed in the same area are Bongeusa Temple and the Pulmuone Kimchi Museum. Seonjeongneung is walking distance from Coex Mall or you can take Line 2 Seollung Station, Exit 8. There are wheelchairs free for use as well as baby strollers for rental.", October 2013
51,4.0,deserve a visit,"The burial ground is part of the 40 tombs of members of the Joseon Dynasty (1392–1910),  which were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2009. What make it special is three factors. First, it is in the south of the capital city, and is about 350 meters from Seolleung Station.  Second, it consists of not one, but three tombs for two kings and one queen.  Finally, it is nice to walk in the park, since there are trees there. The westernmost tomb belongs to the 9th King Seongjong (r. 1469–1494).  His second wife was buried here because she gave birth to the king’s second son. The son later became the 11th king (r. 1506–1544), called King Jungjong. The other Easternmost tomb belongs to him. He became king after his predecessor and his half brother was dethroned for being the worst tyrant in the dynasty’s history.", September 2012

Both Jeongneung (Royal Tomb of King Jungjong) and Seolleung (Royal Tomb of King Seongjong and Queen Jeonghyeon) are located close to each other and are included in a single admission price of less than one US dollar.  Amazing place to visit, especially since it is surrounded by skyscrapers; my tour guide said the land is worth at least seven billion dollars at today's market prices!  In ancient times, the tombs had to be at least four miles outside the city limits of Seoul - not anymore as they are smack dab in the middle of everything south of the Han River.   Make sure you stop by the history center to find out how the tombs were built.", June 2013

55,5.0,One of 17 Clusters of Joseon Dynasty Tombs,"The Seolleung Tombs are perhaps the most easily accessible tombs in Seoul. Since I visited in 2008, I've heard that the tombs themselves can only be visited from a nearby viewing area. I found it fascinating to explore the tombs close-up, but this practice is probably for the best. However, for those who are interested in exploring Seoul's dynastic history, there are numerous tombs surrounding Seoul that have no such barriers.I recommend visiting royal tombs in and around Seoul in the spring when the grass is the most green, and the grounds are the most pleasant for a walk. Seoul's colder seasons will make a rather dreary visit. The Royal tombs of the Joseon Dynasty are the most complete and preserved tomb tradition found in East Asia.", May 2012
