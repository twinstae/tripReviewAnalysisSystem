0,4.0,winter statue,winter time it is not to good to explore almost ever where :-) But I liked to see places filmed n City Hunter :-), February 2020
1,3.0,5 minute photo op,"One of two large statues in the square, it's good for a quick pic then move on.  Not to be  too cynical but there are many statues of many good people around the world.  I guess I am getting a little worn out.", November 2019
2,4.0,Great Statue Of The Admiral Who They Say Was As Good As Nelson,"Admiral Yi Sun-Yin was a famous Korean Admiral, the inventor of the Turtle Ships and famous for his battles and beating the Japanese during the Imjin Wars. He lived from 1545 until 1598 and died of a gun shot wound in battle.His impressive large statue stands in Gwanghuaman Square and worth a look. Yi Sun-Sin improved on the Turtle Ships that had eleven cannons on each side, two each in the bow and stern and spikes on the roof to avoid being boarded.Some historians have put him alongside Horatio Nelson as a a ship-lover leader but that may be pushing it. Better than Horatio!.Nice Statue  but not as nice as the column in London.", September 2019
