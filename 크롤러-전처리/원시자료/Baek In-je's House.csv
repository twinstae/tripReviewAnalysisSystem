0,4.0,Kdrama shooting location,"This is a small museum mansion. Built in 1913 by a pro-Japanese business tycoon, later bought by several people and in the end bought by Baek In Jae-an activist. The mansion has tatami room. Worth a visit.", October 2019
1,4.0,Small but great house museum to visit,"This house is definitely small and a bit hard to locate (the entry point is on 7-gil, which looks like a little side street turnoff from the community center on the corner), but well worth the visit. There is a single guided tour that is offered daily and the language in which it is offered varies by day - check the schedule if you are interested. I did not get a chance to take it, but I believe that the guided tour is the only means by which you can actually enter the house; otherwise you are free to roam around yourself and peer at the interior through the windows. I would offer that the pamphlet provided for the self-guided tour is adequate, and they also provide some other multimedia displays and placards throughout the house. You can see enough of the interior to make the self-guided tour interesting, even without the ability to enter directly.Most interesting part of this house was the explanation provided on how the house/floor heating system worked in Korean design. It was the only explanation I saw in the various places I visited in Seoul.", October 2019
2,3.0,only took about 15 minutes,All the rooms were blocked off so you can only look in through the windows.  It was nice to see what the traditional house looked like with all the furniture.  We were there less than 15 minutes.  Good thing it was free because I would not pay money for this place., August 2019
3,5.0,Amazing Hanok Museum,"One of the best Hanok experiences in Seoul for me. You can visit the inside of the yard and the house, the old house architecture with wooden doors and awnings make the pictures taken very beautiful. You can visit for free, the museum area is quite hidden so the number of visitors is not much, so you can freely travel inside comfortably.", June 2019
4,5.0,Worth a detour to visit,"Like many tourists we came across this accidentally - we'd walked around the village and saw the signs for this, assuming it would be a paid for tourist attraction rather than museum. We walked up the hill and eventually found it - a quiet oasis.It really gave us an insight into the buildings we had seen in the Hanok village. The signs are in English setting out the history of both this and similar houses.", December 2018
5,5.0,W-O-W. Significant. And it's FREE!,"After walking around Bukchon Hanok Village, we were looking for toilets when we chanced upon this. Turned out to be the best consequence of a bathroom-search:)Located up a side road, it's almost devoid of tourists. Walking around the Baek In-Je House, I could imagine how the rich lived in privilege a long time ago. There are English translations so it's easy to understand.", November 2018
6,5.0,This really is an amazing place! Dont miss it!!,"This museum is for free and should not be overlooked if you are interested in history and culture. For granted, this was inhabited by a very rich person and does not symbolize how ""people lived"" in any way. I could just wander around and let my fantasy roam! I would love to recreate this style and house with its setup and ""live happily ever after"". A real dream home to me! Also you can leave your drink outside in a holder, no one will touch it and you can pick it up when you are done. Eating and drinking inside the museum is not allowed, but they do have a ""drink-guard"" at the entrance ;)", July 2018
7,5.0,Love It and Genuine,"This traditional house is a nice place in order to discover the traditional Korean way of lifeIt s like a Museum , when I visited there was not any entrance feesOne courtyard was dedicated to a piano concertIt s located on a small street Magical, peaceful garden, nice spot", May 2018
8,5.0,Excellent example of a historical home with videos and plaques to help explain it,"Well manicured historical home with preserved furniture and building.  There are videos to explain the history as well as plaques to identify the different aspects of the home.  I visited as part of the free tour from the Incheon Airport, so I can't speak about how easy it is to find.  I would allocate only about 30 minutes to this and make sure to include it in all the other palaces, attractions that are within walking distance.  It was free to visit and I enjoyed experiencing historical Korean life.", October 2017
9,5.0,A nice historical house ,Well worth a visit if you are in the bukchon area.  This house museum is free and gives you a look into how life was like for the Korean elite in the past. This is a real house that has been converted to a museum. It is in the middle of other old historical houses that people still live in.  A very worthwhile visit., August 2017
10,5.0,Amazing experience than expected,"although not planning to visit this place and found it while wandering in the Bukchon hanok village area, we very absolutely satisfied with our 1hr visit here. unique designate in a traditional style. Nice and quiet garden with beautiful flowers. cozy and historical atmostphere. No admission fee. you could easily access on foot from Insadong. Highly recommended everyone to visit this place.", May 2017
11,5.0,Good to see with Furniture,A Bukchon house that has been refurbished with added furniture to represent the life the occupants may have experienced. Interesting and a good addition to walking around the Bukchon Samcheong Dong area.Free to enter., February 2017
12,5.0,Fantastic! Best place I visited in South Korea!,"Stumbled upon this house as we meandered through Bukchon. So absolutely thrilled that we did.This is a beautifully restored upper class 'modern Hanok' home. Privately owned and closed to the public until bought by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, restored and opened in 2015, the history of this home is enthralling. It was built by a rich bank president, then lived in by a publisher, a surgeon and lastly the surgeon's widow until she was 103. Such a beautiful home. I would love to have lived here. A home designed with a touch of the past Hanok style and modernised with Japanese elements such large glass windows, long wooden planking on the floors and a tatami room. The enlarged men's quarters features a 'living room' with beautiful glass doors designed for entertaining visitors and discussing business and politics. The view into the kitchen area is really interesting as well as one can truly understand how the ondol heating system works. There is an explanatory sign showing the heating system method.While we were there one of the site attendants told us that this house was featured in the movie 'Assassination'. Upon return home we promptly watched the movie (excellent, available on Netflix) and low and behold noticed that the house was the home of the pro-Japanese business magnate (not unlike the owner owner) and there were several scenes of the living room and the kitchen. So if you're looking for a beautiful Hanok home to visit, with an interesting story, in a quiet neighbourhood, nice views of north Seould, then this truly is the spot for you. As noted in the title, this was the most interesting spot I visited during our short time in South Korea. A very memorable experience that you can see again when get home and watch Assassination!Oh and it's free to visit.", October 2016
13,4.0,Cozy + Short Historical Walk,"Baek In-Je House Museum is a wonderful place for visitors who are on their track to find Bukchon 8 Spots because it is located in the same area (Bukchon Hanok Village). Although the house was not really huge, the house is full of surprised because you'll get to see how people used to live in a traditional Korean house FOR FREE!! If you are really interested in this place, remember to bring a map or else you might get lost between those houses! The only bad thing of this place is that it is not disable friendly!", June 2016
