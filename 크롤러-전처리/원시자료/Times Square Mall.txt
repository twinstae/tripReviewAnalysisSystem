58,4.0,More Awesome Shopping In Seoul!,"I have been to this mall every time I have visited Seoul (3x now) and while I enjoy the selection the mall has to offer (mostly mainstream brands like Muji, Uniqlo, Zara etc), you'd probably do better price wise in Myeondong/Dongdaemun/Gasan Digital Complex, especially if you're looking for Korean fashion.  That being said, this mall is huge and you could easily spend a day here.  It is quite a way from Myeongdong (where I usually stay when I visit Seoul), so you might want to take that into consideration if you have time constraints.  Also, if you go to the food court, it is self service.  That is, you order from a group of cashiers in the back, pay, and then you get a buzzer where you then go to the appropriate vendor to pick up your food.  At the time, I went, they didn't have English menus, so I had to take a picture of what I wanted and then show it to the cashier.  Also, I noticed August tends to be a big sale month and that there was a big event for SPAO (leading Korean clothing chain) selling clothes at bargain prices just outside the mall.  I do not know if this is a regular event, but probably something to keep in mind if you love their clothing.", February 2015
59,4.0,"Big, Very Modern - something for everyone","Very modern shopping experience - many high-end stores (Rolex, Prada, etc), but also local moderate priced places such as E-Mart.  Good food court, and a variety of restaurants throughout the 6 levels of the mall.  Very close to the subway station, and both Shinsegae and Lotte are big department stores that are right there in the area.  Easy to get a taxi if the subway is not your thing.  If you are looking for value-priced shopping venture to the lower mall levels, including the subway underground.  I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent Napa Valley wine selection at E-mart, pricier than the US, but many good selections nonetheless...  The mall opens promptly at 10:30 every morning (doors are locked until then), so no need to rush to get there too early.  ATMs that dispense Korean currency are conveniently located in the lower level of the mall.", December 2014
