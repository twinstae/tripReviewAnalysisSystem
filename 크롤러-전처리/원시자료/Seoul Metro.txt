2,4.0,Convenient way to travel around Seoul,Looks complicated at first especially when we need to change a few lines to get to our station but using the naver map makes it easier for us to check train timings and the best way to get to our destination. Train cabin is usually clean and comfortable. Not all exit has a lift/escalator or sometimes there are stairs leading to the platform so you may need to carry your luggage up and down the steps., January 2020

5,5.0,THIS IS THE WAY TO GET AROUND SEOUL,"When visiting Seoul in January this year, my wife and I found that the Seoul Metro is the ideal way to get around Seoul. Just go to the underground and purchase a Transportation Card and then just top it up when needed. Getting from point to point is easy by reading the subway maps which can be paper or on the walls of the subway. We used it every day and had no problems. Highly recommend.", January 2020
6,5.0,Perhaps the best subway system in the world,"Don't hesitate to use the Seoul subways. They are clean, well-lit, and safe at any hour. Unlike Tokyo with its multiple competing transportation lines that don't appear on all maps, Seoul's subway system is integrated and maps are designed so that it is easy to figure out the route.  All signage and announcements are in English and Korean, and lines are color coded and stops are both numbered and named. If you get lost, just ask anyone for help. Almost everyone speaks English  and will be happy to help you navigate the system. There are a few negatives - it gets crowded at rush hour, especially on the green circle line around Gangnam station, and most entrances and exits are via long staircases with limited elevator access and not enough escalators for those who want to ride upstairs. Aside from that, it's smooth sailing. Almost forgot -  it's very affordable, costing less than $2  for a one way ride, and less than $5 to connect to the Incheon line to get to Incheon international airport.  I have traveled extensively throughout the world and have never found a subway system that could manage such a high volume of passengers so cheaply, safely, and efficiently. Thank you, Seoul!", July 2019

8,3.0,Confusing for foreigners,"Taking the train around Seoul is quite an eye opening experience. Unlike Japan, everything inside the different stations are written in Korean and translating to where you as a foreigner wants to go to is such a major headache...even with Google maps.

But once you find the right way of using it, it becomes a cheap and fast way of getting around Seoul. The trains are very frequent, om time and extremely clean, like everything else in this fantastic city. As long as you know which exit to use, that's the main thing that can be tricky because every underground station also has a multitude of shops. I suggest using the  KakaoMetro App, along with a good map and some good old common sense.", January 2020

Buses may be a better option if you’re taking a train around 11pm.", January 2020
31,5.0,Road Trip ,"Seoul Subway System is a lot like either New York City or London. 9 million people on the move. For the equivalent of $2 you can go anywhere.

The announcements are in Korean and English. The electronic display inside the carriages, is spoken in Korean and English as well as written.  Signs in the stations also have an arrow showing you what the next stop is in English. There is no eating or drinking on the subways so the area is clean. People are respectful and we felt safe even late at night. A great way to get around. There are quite a few stairs but usually you can find a lift as well. The shops are also amazing in the subways.

Get a T-Money card and forget about getting the single trip tickets which can be a pain during busy time with many tourists trying to do the same.  All stations we visited do have escalators in at least one of their exits but it could be a long walk if it is not the exit you needed.  Do look out for the signs for the dedicated seats for the pregnant, disabled and elderly if you are not one of these.", December 2019

54,3.0,Beware of old people when travelling with young children,"Whilst the metro has better than average step free access, the directions were often confusing to the discerning tourist. However, what is annoying and its probably a cultural thing is the older generation when travelling with small children, they will actively come over and touch your child without your consent even if you have covered their faces with a hat as they will remove it to look and take pictures. I found this disturbing, also there are certain older gentlemen who were staring at our girls in a peculiar way and only looked away after I confronted them.

57,5.0,Very convenient and cheap!,"There is no better way then you travel by the metro if you want to save money. It is time consuming sitting on the metro to get to your location, but trust me when I say it saves a lot of money. Every time you use the metro, it takes 1250₩. When you transfer, it takes a transfer fee between 200₩ to 500₩. You won’t transfer between a lot of subway lines. Maximum usually three transfers. The subway is very very easy to use, sometimes it can be confusing with all the signs to locate where to go, but they show you in English and say in English what the next stop is. The metro gets very very busy during rush hour. Sometimes you’ll be waiting in line and won’t get on until the third subway that passes by. Usually rush hour is around 4pm – 6pm since that is when people get off work. However, do not be afraid since a new train comes by every 5 – 10 minutes. The subway runs until 12am the latest and there are designated seating area for elders, pregnant women, individuals who have physical accessibility needs, and also individuals with luggages.", December 2019

60,5.0,Great place to get around the city,"The Korean Metro is one of the easiest metro mass transit system. Even without knowing their local language, you can probably figure out their metro lines and get to where you need to go. Just get used to the machines to purchase your metro card...

When you're on the platform, each stop has a sign that shows the stops just before & just after the one where you're standing.  I especially liked that there are two sets of sliding glass doors--one on the platform doesn't open until the train is there with doors open.  No way to fall onto the tracks!

73,4.0,great system once you learn it,"Once you understand the system it is really quite easy...  With limited English we used our observations.  Approaching trains are signalled with a musical tune.  There are lines - diagonal for entry/exit on the platform.   While on the subway, if the station is one you can change lines on, it plays a tune.   The biggest challenge we faced was exiting the subway.  There are up to 14 exits which pop you up on the street in VERY different locations.  Locals were always keen to help and assist, however more than often unable to due to language difficulties.", October 2019

I believe the Baidu app does include the Metro though.  So download that.  It works much better in Asia.", December 2019
84,4.0,Seoul Metro,"It is not dissimilar to subway lines in Hong Kong, Singapore or Japan.  After one or two rides you get the hang of the color coding and direction of the Metro lines.

104,5.0,Best metro system I've ever used ,"I've used metro systems in several cities but this one takes the cake. Connectivity is excellent and station density depends on the population density around the station so in the heart of Seoul you're never more than a ten minute walk from a station.

The biggest obstacle is the sheer number of stations and lines available.

You can plan a route and it will tell you what trains to take and a map of the stations blinking. Some newer stations are bigger than some airports and some older stations are so small that the platforms are so small that if it wasn't because there are doors at the edge of the platform people would definitely fall on the tracks. It is like any other big city subway system but their signs are much better. Some signs on the street at the entrance will show where the train is so you don't have to rush downstairs. The exits are numbered so you never exit the station and find yourself in the middle of nowhere.   If you are meeting people just tell them the station name and exit number. It is fast and convenient. There is a lot of underground walking if you are changing trains. The worst part is that Koreans like to walk with their eyes on their phones instead of ahead of them so be careful not to get run over by a Korean watching tv while walking.
