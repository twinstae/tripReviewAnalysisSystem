0,5.0,Interesting hidden place overlooked by tourist,"When it comes to seeing Seoul city from the upper view, most people will go to Namsan tower or Seoul Sky. But this Jeongdong observatory surprisingly is a place that over a beautiful view of Deoksugung Palace, the cafe on the 13th fl. is a relaxing place to sit while sipping", October 2019
1,5.0,Lovely Treat,"I walked past this Seoul City Hall Seosomun building and curiosity made me go inside and up to the 13the floor. The view of Jeongdong in this observatory is awesome. It seems like you don't have to buy any beverage or dessert in the cafe inside to see the view.  I walked in and looked at the view and took pictures. There are also historical pictures of the area in a nearby small room and a brochure to tell you the history of this place. It is not on the main path of things to see, but it is definitely worth checking out.", October 2019
2,5.0,Hidden gem,"Took a while to find, but it’s basically to the left of Daehanmun. Just walk down the path and you see a City Hall building to your left. Walk towards it and there will be signs pointing you to the observatory. The view here is great and there is not a lot of people even on a weekend. While you do not have to purchase drinks when at the site, it will be polite to do so (the tea is pretty cheap at 2000KRW).", June 2019

4,4.0,Little hidden gem in Seoul,"This observatory is located inside an office building, on 13th floor. It's a nice place for sipping a cup of coffee/tea while enjoying the view of Deoksugung and some parts of Seoul's city skyline.", March 2019
5,5.0,Great views with good tea,"This was worth a visit.  In the lobby of the building it might look like only government officials are allowed to go up the elevators, but don't let this dissuade you.  We were able to go up and take in great views of Deoksugung Palace and the city while enjoying hot tea.  Something I never saw in the restroom before:  a shelf had about a dozen mugs each with a toothbrush inside.  I assume this was for employees. I thought that was pretty cool.", November 2018

11,5.0,Perfect hidden gem,This was such a wonderful find with a perfect view of modern and old Seoul at the same time.

13,5.0,Panaromic view of the city centre with a cup of coffee,"A good place to rest your feet after ambling about at Deoksugung Palace.

14,3.0,Worth of visit,This place is on 13th floor of Seoul City Hall. Just next south to Deoksung Palace - it’s not inside of palace walls. Free entry and from 13th floor you will find affordable cafeteria. Easy to visit even for a short time. Nice view., November 2017
15,4.0,Great spot,"Marvellous viewpoint overlooking the palace. Despite being free, not packed, although difficult to find (walk along the wall until you see the government building; door is on the right hand side of the building). Little signage in English so follow the locals. Well worth a visit (remember to also look at the old photos on the walls).", January 2017
16,5.0,Amazing,"This view is amazing. One of the best i ever had in Seoul. Is free, there is a small gift shop and coffee shop as well. This place should be well known and isn't.", December 2016
