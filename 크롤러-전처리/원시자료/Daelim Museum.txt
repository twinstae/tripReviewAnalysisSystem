4,4.0,A small but nice museum,"My wife and I saw a paper art exhibition which was nice. Thankfully we got our tickets online (₩4,500) or else we would have waited in line for 30 minutes for a museum that takes a maximum of 1 hour to get through. The normal admission is ₩6,000. There are a couple of nice cafes near the museum but they're packed with people by Saturday afternoon. Get there early!", March 2018
