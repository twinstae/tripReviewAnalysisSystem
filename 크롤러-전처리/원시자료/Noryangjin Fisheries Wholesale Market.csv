0,4.0,Seafooddddd!!!!,"So many choices!!! It feels so asian when you arrive because of all the owners convincing you to buy at their stall! You have to bargain for a good price and afterwards a lady escorts you to their restaurant where they prepare the fish and seafood you just bought! Steamed,", January 2020
1,4.0,For seafood lovers,the location was about 0.5 km from the exit of the Noryangjin metro station. Just walk to straight ahead from the right of the exit and you'll find a signage to the market via a tunnel/underground pass. The price of seafood as expected are the most expensive during winter but, January 2020
2,5.0,Amazing,"If you are a fisherman or seafood lover, this place is amazing. The variety of love seafood is unbelievable.  Very clean and unique. Largest prawns I ever saw. Upstairs Resturants will prepare what you buy but did not try this. Others say it was very expensive. Suggest negotiating before purchase.", January 2020
3,1.0,Buyer Beware! rip off alert.,"Came here on a whim at 10:30 and expected this place to be bustling. There were about 6 people milling about. Selection of available seafood was unimpressive, I saw nothing I hadn't already seen in your run of the mill chinatown in the states. I made a small purchase from one reasonable seller, 15000 for 5 oysters and some small shrimp..I wanted to get some more variety so browsed around. Found some other stalls and ended up getting ripped off, which I suppose is my fault for not being aware of standard market prices-- I was charged more than double the going rate for piece of salmon and shrimp. The seller called some chinese guy over to ""translate"" (Im bilingual) but really so they could work together to gouge me.(to save yourself this grief download the korean Norangyin fish market app (search the name in Korean) which continually updates with current prices.)He then brought me here: Ïùº Î≤à ÏßÄ ÎÖ∏ÎüâÏßÑ ÏàòÏÇ∞ ÏãúÏû• Ïã† Í±¥Î¨º 2 Ï∏µI didn't think it was possible to ruin fresh seafood but somehow they did it! They charged me 19000 won to steam 5 oysters, grill 6 shrimp and a chunk of salmon ALL WITHOUT OILS AND SEASONING, not even salt!!. Everything tasted bland and dry and to add insult to injury all this took 40 minutes. I mean Im shocked they didnt even add any oils. I can't imagine what could have taken so long since they literally added nothing to the food.  Service was just ok.I would not recommend this tourist trap without a guide, they will price gouge you. Ive been to Korea several times and have always found the people to be warm and honest EXCEPT HERE (and the shops at Ewha).", January 2020
4,5.0,Seafoods - from tanks to tables,"I have seen similar places in Singapore, Hong Kong and elsewhere, but this is top on the list if you are interested in live seafood (or sea creatures) - from tank to table. Not pleasant sight for vegetarians - be warned. Highly recommended are crabs and cuttlefish. You would also struggle to find bigger and fresher tuna elsewhere. Don‚Äôt expect however to find live prawns (though they are common in HK and Spore). Price is reasonable - perhaps 20-30% below HK and Spore prices - Apple with Apple comparisons.", December 2019
5,3.0,Be warned!,"Just want to prep those visiting this place. We went to this market given the high review on the freshness. The food that we bought from the whole market were indeed very fresh and not too expensive. We paid for the cockles, abalone, prawn and fish.  After choosing, we were told that the price for cooking is Won 8,000 per kg for BBQ or steaming, preparing the sashimi is FOC. So we happily sat down on level 2 at the ‚Äòdesignated‚Äô area.We bought:Cockle - 1 kg at Won 10,000Sole fish - Won 32,000Abalone - Won 18,000Prawn - Won 10,000Oyster - Won 8,000The waitress took our instruction on how we want to cook the food. We bought tempura and fried small crabs. It was yummy! The cooked food turned out to be really delicious.So here comes the best part. For cooking up the food, the fee:BBQ fish (half) - Won 8,000BBQ abalone - Won 8,000Steam fish (half) - Won 8,000Sashimi handling - Won 8,000Abalone handling - Won 5,000Frying chilli cockle - Won 20,000Service fee - Won4,000 x 8 = 32,000We were quite surprised that what we were told by the wholesaler is different from the restaurant. In fact, the cooking fee cost more than the food itself! In any case, we told the restaurant we will only paid what we were told. We said to the restaurant that charges should be clearly informed to consumer so to avoid any misunderstanding. Instead of gracefully admit the mistakes, she said ‚ÄúÊ≤°ÂÖ≥Á≥ªÔºåËøò‰ºöÊúâÂà´ÁöÑX ÊóÖÂÆ¢‚Äú patronising... ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è", December 2019
6,5.0,"Unique experience, a must for foodies","It's nowhere near as exotic or hectic as Tsukiji in Tokyo but it's fun buying the fresh fish and having it prepared to your liking at the market. Grilled turbot and sashimi - yum! The fact that nobody speaks English makes it even more fun - we had to use hand gestures, Google Translate, calculators - to communicate what we wanted.", November 2019
7,3.0,Good experience but pricey,"Lots of stalls offering the same seafood. We bought about 2kg King Crab and a 2kg Lobster + a few freebies (few prawns and oysters) that costed about krw170k which I don‚Äôt think is cheap compared to where I came from where seafood is imported. However, these are fresh and therefore delicious.Do note though, the price of cooking these at the 2nd floor is not cheap either. It costs me about krw100k. Cooking goes by a fix krw4k/pax cover charge and krw8k/kg cooking charge and additional charge for rice, drinks & etc.To conclude, you can go for the experience if you don‚Äôt mind spending. If not, you can spend this money somewhere else.", November 2019
8,4.0,Varieties of Seafood!,"My Daughter and I walked around the market being wowed by the different varieties of seafood but to avoid the hassle of haggling to buy and paying the preparation fees, we opted to go directly in one of the restaurant upstairs. We choose a restaurant that served a course menu of Korean style sashimi with 14 dishes. I would say, the food was average when it comes to taste but but the squirming chopped live octopus was definitely an amazing and unique experience.", September 2019
9,5.0,Best place to get seafood in Seoul,"The best place to get seafood in Seoul. The fish stall are linked to the restaurant, so Khuan need to select and they will cook for you. A bit pricey but the king crab is worth the price. A heartfelt meal for the whole family.", November 2019
10,4.0,Fresh seafood but be careful of the Restaurant Price,The lady that sealling the fresh seafood was very friendly and give us advise on the seafood that we chose. And the price is reasonable too.But be careful of the restaurant you going to choose.they will charge you the price very high..that what happend to us., November 2019
11,3.0,Fresh...Fresh Seafood!,"Visited on a weekday morning and it's not crowded. Abundance of stalls selling live seafood. The lady selling us the seafood was extremely friendly but the guy was quite arrogant! She also brought us to a small restaurant on another floor to prepare the seafood for us. The food preparation was fine but the charges just for the cooking was expensive. Overall, not really worth it.", November 2019
12,5.0,Best whole fish market in Seoul,"All fresh seafood are here . Not too expensive. And you can choose the restaurant for cooking upstairs . The price for cooking is also cheap . Very impressed . Some use English speaking, very easy to communicate", October 2019
13,3.0,"Great market, but beware of the restaurant","Went to Noryangjin fish market with my wife to treat ourselves to king crab. Managed to get a good price for 2.8kg crab ($180Aud), however, we were stung by the restaurant preparing our crab. First there was the serving fee ( which almost doubled in price because we didn't have soup), than the steaming fee for the crab (charged per kilo). What started up being a simple day of buying and eating fresh crab, ended being an expensive day at the restaurant, charging us approximately $60aud just to steam and serve our crab with a garnish of 4 pieces of lettuce, 1 chilli and 1 sliced fresh garlic. It's cheaper to go to a restaurant that has king crab and get them to prepare it.Btw, the crab was delicious. Meat was firm and sweet. Much better than buying the frozen crab legs.", November 2019
14,4.0,Big one!!!,My friends mum said this place made new building.So big..!!!  We choose sea foods then go up stairs one of restaurant we can eat these we choose sea foods. but quite expensive here ...Sea foods cost + cooking cost +cover charge etc...We spent 5 of us W 320000 all up.But one day of experience is GOOD!!!, October 2019
15,4.0,Fresh seafood with different level of pricing,"There were plenty of seafood, it was very interesting we went round and round the market. King Crabs are a common sight.. Fresh Fish if you want it sashimi style. We check the price, it was very costly. They have different layers of pricing like buying the fresh seafood price. They lead you to the Restaurant upstairs, There is a surcharging of per dish fee, tea fee, side dish fee, per head fee before you sit down. In the end, we decide not  to have dinner there. But it is a good visit, I get to see new seafood that I never seen before.", May 2019
16,5.0,The freshest seafood you could possibly find in Seoul,"My daughter and I visited this place because we wanted to get fresh seafood, and true enough this was the perfect place. There are fresh seafood vendors inside and outside and we opted to just eat fresh sushi but there are fresh seafood inside where you can purchase and take to the restaurants upstairs and they will cook it however way you would like it cooked. It was a great experience anyway and we wanted to visit the place as well. For a seafood wholesaleMarket , it was pretty clean and organized and not chaotic. It was easy to catch a cab in the other street after we ate. The place closes early in the afternoon so make sure you go there early in the morning or late morning .", October 2019
17,3.0,Costly seafood,Heard from friend to give it a try. Ordered crab and 2 large prawns and cost 73000 won with cooking fee. Seafood tastes very fresh., October 2019
18,5.0,Pricy but the experience is worth it!,"We went there after all what we heard and read about that place! We really enjoyed the evening! The food is super fresh and tasty. Picking such fresh fish isn't something you can do in many places around the world! Yes, it was pricy and yes they charge foreigners more and yes you have to negotiate the price but isn't this part of the fun üòä", October 2019
19,4.0,"Visit, take lots of pictures, don' t buy","A clean large fish market with a huge variety of fish and seafood. When you just buy as a final customer, it is really expensive. Busan is better in that respect.", October 2019
20,4.0,Lunch at the fish market is pricy,"As many of you have probably read in other reviews you buy seafood from one of the vendors on the main floor. Then you're brought up to the 2nd floor where they take you to a restaurant where they cook the food for you. I bought a king crab (price is by weight) and an order of prawns which came 5 in an order. That cost me KRW 60,000 which is about $50. I thought that would be it but when I went to pay the restaurant charged ME another approximately KRW 30,000 as a service fee for cooking the food. All in with a beer cost me about USD $90 or fractional more. The food was fresh and good but I wasn't prepared to spend that much. Oh well you live and learn.", October 2019
21,5.0,Must visit,Come here and view an auction or just walk around looking at the different selection. There are a couple of restaurants on the 2nd floor that will cook you any of the fish you buy. Food was fantastic and the experience was well worth the time, September 2019
22,1.0,Overpriced,"This is the first time I‚Äôve brought my parents along, and this isn‚Äôt my first time here, was pretty excited as my parents love to have seafood. We had fun selecting our seafood with reasonable price but the nightmare started when we finished our dinner and was going to pay our bills. Couldn‚Äôt believe my own eyes how much it costed us. We had 4 seafood, 3 out of 4 dishes was steam, we only had our crabs stir fried, yet the bill was exorbitant. Our seafood costed 56000won with a fish, 4 abalone, 2 crabs and 8 prawns. The bill for dinning in the restaurant was 71000won.", September 2019
23,5.0,Highlight to Our Trip to Seoul,This isn't a place to save money. It is an experience that is so memorible and delectable it has to enjoyed. My 3 children and niece were mesmerized by all the edible sea creatures for over an hour. When we finally chose our dishes they were prepared upstairs... sushi downstairs (where my hawk of a mother-in-law made sure we got the freshest selection) My five year old had sea cucumber and enjoyed it. I will remember that taste for a long time., July 2019
24,5.0,Fascinating ,"Was there towards the end of the day with colleagues. The market was still rather active, more sellers than buyers at that time of the day. Assortments, types of live seafoods were incredible.We bought several types of fish, abalone, prawn and brought them to the restaurants upstairs. It was packed, very crowded. Nonetheless, the fish prepared in sashimi style, except abalone and prawn, which were steamed, were served in no time. Very fresh and so tasty.Highly recommended for seafood lovers.", August 2019
25,3.0,Lots of seafood,"We spent about $400 worth of seafood. Great price, but when added the cooking fees, it was not really a good deal at all. However, seafood tasted fresh and really good.. Recommended to visit and maybe spend less $. Must bargain all the times.", July 2019
26,1.0,carefull,Can vist but advice not buy to cook in the above restaurant.Too expensive.Be Carefull the charger of restaurant charger.Even We asked bf bring It to restaurant., August 2018
27,4.0,Interesting offerings,"Though not a ""fish person,"" I truly enjoyed visiting this market which offers numerous varieties of seafood not readily found in the US. There were huge shrimp/prawns/scallops, even larger crabs and lobsters, and vendors nimbly climbing on the tanks to retrieve product. We did not elect to eat at the market, but if one didn't want to ""chance"" a cooked-to-order overcharge, they could opt for a wide variety of offerings from the restaurants on the second floor.", June 2019
28,3.0,To Experience it.,"This place is in my itinerary for Seoul trip. Just wanted to experience the fish market in Korea. We took public transportation to get there and venture into the market. The 1st floor (ground floor) is dedicated for seafood heaven. All sort of fresh seafood selling here. Know how to bargain, know which seller will give you their best price. Usually people will buy the seafood here and will go upstairs to the restaurant for them to cook it. Well,we did not do that as we rather cook it ourselves at the place we were staying. So, in our bags we have prawns, scallops, cockerels, fishes, squids. Upstairs,  on the 2nd floor you have the restaurants, more seafood vendors, meat section and dried section. We even bought some anchovies and dried shrimps. All set with heavy bag, we head on to the subway, heading back to our place. Overall, it was pretty interesting to experience the market, interesting vendors, friendly and we really enjoyed it. Beside the seafood are indeed fresh.", June 2019
29,1.0,Avoid !!!!,"We were charged abt 250000 won for cooking service whereas our seafood is around 320000 won.. the cooking service was overcharged‚Ä¶ Will never go again n will not recommend too‚Ä¶ In total , one meal we spend Singapore dollars 600 plus.. for one king crab, 6 scallops, 6 abalone, half steam fish, a piece of bbq salmon, 2 octopus fried with vegetable, one dish of vegetables, one fried rice, 4 pcs of sea urchin, small plate of shading octopus, one plate of fried prawns . 6 adults one kid ‚Ä¶", June 2019
30,3.0,Biggest Fish Market in Seoul (i guess),"the place is well maintained although the elevator has a stinky, fishy smell when we went there. Lots of fresh seafoods inside the aquariums for you to choose.just let the ""on-site Cooks"" know ahead of time to not overcook your seafood 'coz they have a tendency to do this.If you're looking for the live raw octupus to eat, this place has it. they sell baby octupus that even when chopped alive, the poor creature still moves and has the suctioning parts", June 2019
31,2.0,Overpriced,Cooking fee is expensive and 1 seat costs 6000 won each. Insane.Seafood is alright but the fee is unreasonable. The sellers always push us to buy their seafood and some of them have bad attitudes., June 2019
32,5.0,Fascinating place ,I visited this place after watching multiple YouTube videos about it with my husband. This was a fascinating place to visit lots of weird and wonderful fish that you won‚Äôt find anywhere else in the world in a fish market. I recommend stopping if you are visiting Korea it‚Äôs one of those once in a lifetime experiences that you won‚Äôt get back home if you are From a very western country The only complaint we had was trying to get a taxi out as none of the drivers speak English and they refuse to take you anywhere if they can‚Äôt understand you. Taxi rank is hard to find due to construction, May 2019
33,1.0,Seafood Trip.....Regretted!,"Overrated and not worth at all. The seller keep pushing for you to buy from them. Once bought, the restaurant upstairs not bothered to entertain you as I am going with my family , total 4 persons. Finally got a place, after 3 restaurants rejected us as they are expecting more crowds/ table during meal hours. Then the seat and the cooking fee they charge is more expensive than the seafood we bought! Never again will I go to Noryanjin Market, ever.", February 2019
34,1.0,Sitting charged and cooking fees,"The minutes you walked into the fish market. They approach you quickly n very aggressive into buying crab, fish, clam, octopus and etc. We paid $140 for the smaller crab, halibut and some clams. What pissed me off is upstairs restaurant over charged us for sitting and cooking fees included the soup $130.00. Not very honest peoples and wrong way of doing business. Never again..", April 2019
35,1.0,Stay Away!!  ,"Hmmm...family comes here w high hopes of having fresh fish.  The place is absolutely not tourist friendly.  If you don‚Äôt speak korean then you‚Äôre out of luck.  Instead you get duped into the hands of a racketeer.  A lady and this man on the corner beg us to buy fish.  The man says that this lady owns a restaurant.  Have no idea whether having a connection to a restaurant owner is a must to eat there because I don‚Äôt speak Korean.  So I give into this ploy, buy the fish (30,000 won for a flavorless flat fish slippery-tasting fish that he kept pushing on us, along with a meager portion of salmon and tuna thrown which we had requested) and off we go into this restaurant that the lady leads us to.  The idea is that they would bring the fish to us filleted.   We get side dishes (lettuce leaves and darn-jahng) brought to us and we buy some battered shrimp and fish there.  When we get done we are waved down saying we owe money.  What?  We paid for the fish and the tempura.  What would we owe?  They charged us for not having ordered the soup‚Äîtry 5,000 won per person so 20,000 won.  It‚Äôs ridiculous.  Oh and if the story can‚Äôt get any worse, my husband gets sick from the food.  Yep, upchuck on our trip to Korea.  They should take the license away from these swindlers and make them slough dead skin off of people.  Stay away.  Trust me.  It‚Äôs not worth it.", April 2019
36,1.0,Tricky transaction,"Its a fish market so I am not sure if the management can actually improve it since there are so many vendors. To begin My tolerance level is quite high and i understand its a business, and business is tough. I get it. But after the experience today this place needs a review so that no one else should have to put up with this. This review is for stall #43 not the whole market itself.Now this is not the first time Ive been to this market. The first time was 2 years ago and the experience was fantastic (Old area). The second and also last time I will ever go again was today.We began doing our rounds asking for alaskan king crab prices since this was our priority item. Vendors were throwing out prices per kg left and right. All ranging from 70000 won to 80000 won. Okay we thought. First of all. Its market price and that fluctuates or maybe its not the right season etc. Whatever we just wanted some good crab. Eventually we came to a stall with 2 older ladies that spoke mandarin and gave a price at 65000 per kg. Sold. The lowest price so far and we were getting tired of browsing. First mistake.We ended up buying a whole alaskan king crab weighing 2.4kg at 156k won. They quickly grabbed one from the middle tank, weighed it and shoved it into a plastic bag. Second mistake.After we paid. A guy appeared and took us upstairs to a restaurant where they cooked it. Eventually the steamed crab and abalone arrives to our table, it was already cut since it was an option. Too messy to do it myself. Upon grabbing the largest leg. I realized something was off. Little to no meat, mushy and was sticking to the shell. I inspected all the other legs and found it to be all in same poor quality. Final thought the crab was not fresh. This was either a dead crab that was swapped during cooking or pre frozen. It cant be the same crab we bought 20 minutes ago. Then we realized we did not inspect the crab before they bagged it. Upon even further inspection we found one of the legs was also missing. This was the tipping point for us. We went back to the stall afterwards and feedback to the 2 ladies. Their reply was oh. The restaurant must of overcooked it.  Overcooked? This is a drastic difference in meat quality. It was literally mush. We also mentioned that it was missing a leg. ""Oh yeah the one you bought is incomplete. Thats why its so cheap at 65k. The complete ones are 90k won"" ...now you tell us this after we made the purchase. This type of business handling is street vendors looking to scam tourists. And I must admit. I was at the bad end today.So there are my 2 cents for this visit. I know there are honest vendors in the market. But after the experience today it just tainted what good it had going for it. Its a shame really.", April 2019
37,3.0,Definitely Overcharged,"It is a big building with live and dead seafood. There are hundreds of stalls selling either shell fish or all sorts of fishes. We went on a Monday late morning and we only see a few Koreans in this market. I guess most Koreans do not come to this market for seafood.We got some prawns, scallops, fish, cockles and octopus and a lady brought us upstairs to a restaurant. The seafood costs about KRW 80,000. The food are either bbq or steamed. I must say that the bbq ones are lousy. The cook basically put the prawns and scallops on a hot plate and waited for the food to be cooked without any oil, butter or any sauces/herbs. They came out dry. As for the cockles, the cook just poured the whole bowl into some hot water to cook the meat. Though the flesh is supple, it becomes dry in a very short while. The fish which is steamed is the best. What many reviewers stated is the same. I was quite shocked that the cooking price came up to KRW80,000, especially for such lousy cooking skills and methods.Overall, good to go and take a look at the live seafood. Buy some if you want, but i would advise to bring back to cook yourself.", March 2019
38,3.0,Go if you like such things...,"... not to eat. I enjoy fish markets the world over. I go very early in the day to look around and take pics. This place is impressive, if a bit odd. It‚Äôs very close to the subway station. I didn‚Äôt bother to buy anything and have it cooked at one of the upstairs restaurants.", March 2019
39,1.0,Overcharging for seafood and restaurant fees(specially),"From the past reviews here, I was gamed and prepared to experience the bargaining for such tourist place. But little did I expect the fee at restaurant (door no.17) was more than the seafood purchased at level 1.To summarise, each dish/seafood is chargable 10k to 20k cooking fee, unless u specifically tell the service staff to steam (still chargeable 8k per kg). That is on top  of the 5k per person fee.I have experienced the fish market in other cities in korea, but not as expensive as noryangjin fish market. I can say the seafood at level 1 is fresh and that's it. But as tourist we can bring those around without the restaurant.I have sensed the market was oddly quiet environment @ 11am, not a single other tourist sighted except us and fish sellers. Definitely, restaurant #17 at least, although the service staff explained its is the standard rate there and blah blah. As I was travelling with a large family, I didnt argue much. Lesson learnt. Black listed place. First and worst experience in seoul so far.", February 2019
40,4.0,Pushy sales people following you around,"FYI: This is a working fish market...wear sensible shoes (avoid flip flops, high heels and open toe shoes). I have really mixed reviews about this place.  Definitely good to snap a few memorable photos but I don't think the locals like it unless you buy something from their stall.  On the other hand, I also probably ate the best king crab I ever had with my spouse and his buddy. Part of the experience was rather uncomfortable. As soon as we walked in, there were people who started following us, speaking in Mandarin and pressuring to buy the seafood and take upstairs to cook on the second floor.  Probably close to no one there speaks a word of English.  I would also recommend to pay premium and buy something that is alive and swimming, not something that has been sitting on display on a bed of ice as we learned the hard way. The skewer of scallops that was on display on ice ended up hard and chewy.   The live king crab (close to $100 USD) was worth the price even though when you take it upstairs, they charge a cooking fee (we took it to Dragon Palace #17 where lots of people were eating...clearly a good sign).", November 2018
41,3.0,Go there with a korean,"Its a cool place to see, but I wouldnt personally go there again without someone that knows korean. When there, do not only check out the new fish market tho. Also give some time to the old one, which whilst is not as fancy. Its pretty interesting to see, and was for me more fun than the indoors market.", February 2019
42,4.0,Great Market Tour and Fresh Seafood Meal,"We always make it a point to visit local markets during our tours to see the kind of fresh food they have. This is more like a huge seafood distribution centre which also does retail sales. Despite coming with empty stomachs, we almost couldn't finish all our food. Were too ambitious and bought too much food. Had a king crab, some prawns, abalones, scallops, and huge plate of mixed sashimi for four of us. The steamed king crab was the highlight! Really juicy and full of meat! The abalones were lightly BBQed and it was tender and juicy too! The sashimi was really fresh and we had never eaten so much sashimi at one seating! TIP1: choose those king crab with one leg less ... they charge less per kg for the imperfect crabTIP2: watch out for those ""freebies""... ours (the prawns and scallops) turn out to be not really fresh ...", December 2018
43,1.0,WARNING - RUINED SEAFOOD,"We visited the markets post reading some positive reviews and some not so positive, as well as numerous travel blogs recommending this as a must when coming to South Korea. Well, those that rated it highly must be rating only based on the novelty of the experience or have no culinary experience, a lack of taste buds, low expectations, or a mix of it all. The first part - the seafood market - delivers as expected. Lots and lots of sea creatures to buy either alive or already dead. Including some already ready to eat as sashimi. It may not be to everyone‚Äôs liking though, seeing all these fishes and crustaceans crammed in small containers...so be prepared. A lot of venders, all pretty much selling the same stuff. So shop around for what looks best if you want, and don‚Äôt forget to barter if you can be bothered which is almost an expectation (note that most places don‚Äôt show prices for that reason). It helps to buy all you need from one vendor to get a better price overall.We stopped at one vendor, who actually spoke reasonable English, and bought large prawns, octopus, king crab, scallops and he threw in some free oysters and clams - however I have to say that we got well overcharged for what we chose (yep, we didn‚Äôt really bother bartering), so the free stuff feels a lot more like a sympathy gift, or a bonus for all the money we gave him 195,000 KRW ($240 AUD).(Note: You will have to pay for your food to get cooked, and you pay per item - so stuff they throw in for free, will be charged to be cooked...)After we paid for our sea bounty, the vendor handed us over to a younger guy whom we followed to a restaurant on the second floor. The restaurant looked clean, had two small groups of people, and didn‚Äôt really smell like any cooking had happened. But we sat any ways. The option was only 2 cooking methods, steam or BBQ. The lady serving us took the prawns to BBQ and the rest to steam. We went along with it thinking let‚Äôs trust in the seafood chef. What we got was so disappointing, considering the amazing seafood we had over paid for.None of the food came with any sort of soup, broth, herbs, spices, anything what so ever. The steamed oysters had no flavour (lucky they were ‚Äòfree‚Äô). We wanted them just raw or grilled at most. Maybe some ginger or garlic, something!The crab was nice but bland and dry, again not cooked in any special way - just steamed.The prawns had been cooked on the bbq for way too long - they came so dry and chewy (not cooked with any butter or any sort of sauce). The octopus first came out sashimi - which was a fun first time experience. After a few mouthfuls of moving tentacles, we asked if they could grill the rest of it, but again they came back steamed. We had a few more mouthfuls and left the rest due to lack of flavour - at one point the waitress came over and took the octopus plate away, and returned it having been steamed a second time (you have to laugh at the madness).So...after having selected what we thought was going to be an amazing seafood bounty, paying through the nose for it, we were left completely gutted that they had ruined it all by simply steaming every bit of it, over bbq‚Äôing the prawns, no sauce, no broth/soup, no flavours, not even a garnish. And all of that for 52,000 KRW ($64 AUD)!We left with a lack of delicious flavours playing in our mouths (I was seriously expecting something delicious like I‚Äôve gotten all over Seoul so far on this one month trip), a big hole in pockets, and a very poor view of this ‚Äòhighly rated‚Äô must do when in Seoul experience.Go buy the seafood, barter barter barter (or get a Korean to go with you - maybe even buy them a gift it will still save you money), and take it home to cook yourself, if you need use some YouTube videos or other online cooking guide, I don‚Äôt think you could go any more wrong than what we got served today!", January 2019
44,3.0,Great experience for photo taking but not food,"plenty of seafood to sea in a market, but wasn't really please with the restaurant. Note that the purchase price of seafood and to cook it is a separate cost altogether. Nothing fantastic about the style of cooking so its probably just worth going there for the experience", January 2019
45,4.0,Fun to shop around and then eat what you buy,"You really shouldn't fault the hawkers for doing their job - hawk all that fresh seafood! And the fun is in the banter in broken korean and english with them and if you are keen to eat the freshest and most diverse, then you should try it out. And there will always be a another keen restauranter who would be keen to help you cook and prepare what you have bought. For us, it was fun, and plentiful of good tasty pescetarian delights!", January 2019
46,4.0,Yummy seafood Good eats Worth the Stop,"Honestly, it's a great place to eat fresh seafood and have it prepared at one of the many restaurants that are located behind the market ans delivered right to your table.Pros: 1. Friendly merchants who attempt to square dab2. Fresh sashimi from a fish that was just swimming in a tank as opposed to those ""frozen"" places that I have to wait to eat so it thaws out before you can even it.3. Fresh oysters cut on the 1/2 shell that melt in your mouth.4. Yummy steamed shrimp served up and ready to peel/eat.  5. Very affordable for a family of 4 if you stick with the basics...All of the above go down well with beer or soju! Enjoy.Cons:1. Be ready for the smell of the fish market and wear your shoes that you don't care about just in case they get wet and smell like seafood for the rest of your trip.2. Sometimes, it takes time to get your fish cooked soup brought to your table.", December 2018
47,1.0,Definitely a NO to Noryangjin Market,"The sea products varieties are there. But the hawker are pushing you to buy the king crap or other prized product. Once you bought and you go to 2nd floor to the restaurant, the same attitude is reflecting. They will look at what you have purchased. If you buy too little seafood, they will chase you away or ignore you. Personally for my experience, I have bought abalone, shells, squids and salmon fish and after bargain, only we can eat in one of the restaurant. And the charges of the cooking services(plus the seating place) is much more expensive than the sea product that i bought. Never again will I be back.", December 2018
48,1.0,Not worth going,"The fish market is quite big and easy to go by train but we think can skip this place. We have a bad experience and impression of Korea on the second day of our trip. A lot variety of fresh seafood. The price of fresh seafood is ok but of course have to bargain but this is just the beginning. The worker/owner of the seafood stall will keep following and ask us to go to their restaurant. They don't cook seafood the way you want even we told them to. The cooking fees shown on board of the shop - KRW3,000 per person without soup and KRW5,000 per person with soup. Be cautious, they still overcharged us. The amount of seafood we bought is KRW65,000 but the cooking fees we paid is KRW79,000 whereby no soup and just steam all our seafood. How come they steam our oysters. We want to eat it fresh. We also noticed they only serve soup to Korea citizen and no soup to tourist. When we ask how they got the amount charged for cooking fees, they don't even bother to answer us. This really caused a bad impression for Korea tourism. Hope no one will be the next victims like us. Don't visit the restaurant No. 4.", November 2018
49,1.0,Boring market,It's just another fish market and nothing special about it. Some stall sellers will approach you but I think they are mostly China Chinese. I doubt the price will be good. I think you can spend half an hour there just to get a feel of the place., December 2018

I recommend this air bnb experience to get the most out of your market tour.", November 2018
54,3.0,"Average seafood, very touristy and pushy in sales.","The seafood in this place is not of the best quality. Stall owners there learn Chinese to sell to mainland tourists. Extremely pushy in sales, will follow you all the day and hold you to bring you to their restaurants. It's unique that they cook seafood for you in the way you prefer after purchasing it fresh. The live octopus is also unique to Noryangjin / Korea (haven't actually tried this anywhere else!)", July 2018
55,4.0,It‚Äôs worth the experience!,"We reached Noryangjin Fish Market via subway, stopped at Noryangjin station, walked out at exit 7. About 50m, enter the tunnel on your right and there are signs leading the way to the market. It took us couple of minutes. First stall we approached was stall number 28. Quote for King crab was 39,000 won per kg. It‚Äôs much cheaper than what we read on tripadvisors so we didn‚Äôt explore other stalls. We bought a 2.5kg King crab, 3 abalones for 10,000won and 5 big size prawns for 10,000won for 3 of us. Happy with our purchase we were led upstairs to the restaurant to prepare our food.  We had the King crab steamed, prawns and abalones grilled. King crab meat was so fresh, tender and sweet. Food preparation came to 45,000won, not cheap. Unless you are willing to go from restaurant to restaurant to compare the food preparation, I would suggest just factor in the preparation price into the seafood price. 165,000 won was really worth it especially for such a huge King Crab.", November 2018
56,5.0,Fresh seafood with a reasonable price!,"Very cheap seafood. You can find variety of fish, squids, lobsters, etc. for a very reasonable price. For me it's very cheap compared to Japan. After select the seafood you want, you can go upstairs and bring them to the restaurant. There would be a cooking service available but quite expensive (but worth it anyway)", March 2018
57,1.0,Rip off ,"Never ever left a negative feedback on TripAdvisor but I have to share my experience at the Noryangjin fish marketWe did ask the cooking price in detail before picking this restaurant as one of the restaurant speaks mandarin. We were told 3000 won ‚Äúsitting‚Äù fee for head and 8000 won for cooking king Crab if weight more than one kg. However, we end up being charged 20000 won for each stir fry, 7000 won per kg for king crab and 8000! won each for grilled prawn, 5000 won sitting fee. When we questioned the charging, another staff (who also speaks mandarin) said all the charges are correct and apparently there are 2 types of ‚Äúsitting‚Äù fees.If ordering meals at the fish market, please be cautious. Make sure you have checked the cooking fees per dish beforehand and have the fees written down so there will be no disagreement later.", November 2018
58,3.0,Not worth the trip ,"This so called traditional fish market, apparently due to its popularity and inflow of tourists, is not so ""traditional"" anymore. Though open for 24 hours, we went there during night time, most of the stalls closed and limited seafood available, most of the stalls selling the same range of seafood. I would rather go to a better restaurant with the same price.", November 2018
59,4.0,"Local, authentic fish market","I headed here on the Metro system early one Friday afternoon recently and more or less followed my nose out of the station, through an underpass and came out between the two buildings that make up the bulk of this extensive fish market. I first wandered over to the old building. There were still many stallholders selling their wares but around 2 o'clock in the afternoon there were few buyers. It's safe to say that you should be able to buy any type of marine life you fancy eating here. I wasn't buying and I was rarely stopped for any hard sell.Later, I walked over to the much newer building where, again there seemed to every thinkable type of marine life available for purchase.  Again there were more than enough stalls but few customers. I took the escalator up to the first floor where there was very much the same extensive selection, including loads of dry fish and stalls where you could buy sauces, pastes etc. Lining this floor were many small, rustic type restaurants where I'm sure fresh sea food is a guarantee. I headed deep into the interior of this floor and found an edo sushi restaurant which I simply couldn't resist. This is certainly the place to come if you are curious about seeing a traditional market with the complete focus on the sea and everything that swims, crawls or simply exists in it.", October 2018
60,4.0,Just nice,"Went here by taxi from Myeongdong hotel, it took like 15 mins no traffic 6:30 am. Pros: just nice to see the difference between the seafood here and other places. Stingray seems popular. We came early so the restaurants are closed and we never bothered to make sure bec it‚Äôs early to have a hearty fish meal. cons: It‚Äôs not a small place. It‚Äôs pretty big. Can be exhausting for seniors.Price can be expensive so choose what‚Äôs exotic for you.", November 2018
61,4.0,A fascinating and very hectic place,"The fish market is a fascinating place to visit - probably not the sort of thing high on people's list of ""things to do"", but it is well worth a visit.

66,4.0,Just as good as the first time!,This was our second visit and we can without doubt say this is one of our favorite fish markets in the world.  It‚Äôs not huge and you don‚Äôt need a guide.  Some markets people don‚Äôt want you to take pictures of their items but vendors here are very friendly -just asks first.  They will even hold up items and pose for your photos.  The best part about this place is buying the extremely fresh seafood and heading straight to one of the adjacent restaurants ( if you‚Äôre not sure where to go the vendors will hook you up with someone who will walk you there.  Don‚Äôt worry.  It‚Äôs not a trap).  At the restaurant enjoy your purchases along side a bunch of soju like a local., October 2018

He was VERY personalable and informative. ‚ÄúT‚Äù was able to talk and negotiate for the fresh seafood and most important, have them prepare it how you like (traditional) way. If you like seafood, this is a MUST DO when in Seoul!!!  Unlike myself, I didn‚Äôt read the whole description of what we would expect would be included when booking... included are:- tour of old and new fish market- options of seafood your group may like to try (additional cost if you want something like lobster or in our case, some abalone and scallops). - choices of preparations of food you chose- ENJOY the food that was alive just minutes ago.Our group had a blast!!!

My kids said this is a better experience than the aquarium, because you can see them, touch them and eat them later...LOL.We went there during summer, so not all the vendors were opened, but there are enough vendors for you to choose from.  They have so many kind of seafood, you buy them, and they will cook them upstairs for you.  The king crab is a must!  So much cheaper than getting from a restaurant.  If you re brave enough, try the live octopus, it's a little chewy but very tasty! You do have to neogiate the price to get a good deal, make sure you visit a few more vendors before settle on one.  Overall I'll definitely go back again.", August 2018
73,5.0,Fish market fun,"This place is a must do in Seoul if you like fish. No Korean required. Here‚Äôs how it works. Walk in. Walk around. See what looks good.

If you pick a live fish, they will kill it there. If you want it sashimi style, they will cut it up. Pay for the fish. Then, go with a man who appears from nowhere and takes you upstairs. Don‚Äôt ask questions. He will drop you in a restaurant. Tell them how you want the fish cooked. Sit down. Drink. Cooked fish will appear. Eat. Drink some more. Pay as you leave.

74,5.0,Very interesting! Tourist-friendly place!,There are two separated parts in the Noryangjin Fish Market: the old marked and the new marked. The first one looks like the old traditional market while the second one is a very new and modern market where the tourist can roam around and discover different types of fishes and seafood. The best thing is that you can buy your own fresh seafood and fish at the ground floor and then carry them to the first floor where there are lot of restaurants that cook them for you in a very reasonable price., September 2017
75,5.0,An amazing gastronomic experience ,"We had a great first time experience at the new wing of the fish market. (Go at dinner time! The restaurants are open until past 10pm.)  Probably because we took our time to shop around and suss out the ""market rate"", at no point did we feel ripped off, unlike some of the reviews. Arrived at 6pm via subway. After asking about 10 vendors, we found a more honest seller (stall 13 near south gate no. 2). She quoted significantly lower prices than the rest, but did not entertain much further haggling. We bought crabs, sea urchins, prawns and octopuses from this lady, and a huge platter of sashimi from the stall next door.A boy guided us to an affiliated restaurant called Hyun Dae. There, the Mandarin speaking lady boss came out and asked us how we'd like each item to be cooked. The cooking fee for each style was clearly stated on the wall, in Korean, so we felt reassured. The seafood came out beautifully steamed, grilled and boiled. The restaurant was full of local diners, including couples on dates, and office workers having after-hours drinks. So it did not feel like a tourist trap. The star dish was something we didn't quite buy from the market stall: my friend copied what she saw on a travel show, and got the restaurant to take the empty crab shells with some roe/cream left inside, and make fried rice with them. (Pictured) Best. Fried. Rice. Ever. I think this is a dish any restaurant at the fishmarket can whip up. So do try it. The restaurant bill, which included cooking fees, booze and side dishes for 3 persons, came up to 67k won. Overall,  we had an amazing dinner,  and would totally do it again if we ever return to Seoul.Directions: To get there from the station, do not take the overhead bridge across the train tracks, as Google will recommend.  Though it works, that route will bring you through a dodgy and foul smelling car park. Instead, go via the underground tunnel. It's newish, brightly lit and smelled fine (for a fish market).", August 2018

77,2.0,Interesting place. One time visit only,"I went on a culinary adventure to Noryangjin as some of them wanted to try eating live octopus. The place was easy to find and the market is certainly an interesting place to visit. It‚Äôs amazing how much seafood is harvested and eaten by humans :) I feel like we were ripped off though. We purchased a piece of tuna from the fish display and took it to one of the restaurants on the 2nd floor. Many of us think that they might have swapped our tuna for a different piece while it was being cooked. The piece we purchased was very non uniform and the one we received looked just like a well cut piece. This concern aside, the food was ok (not amazing) and the experience won‚Äôt be the same in a 2nd visit. IMHO a place for a single visit. Be careful with people and watch your fish as it may be swapped on you too.", August 2018

We first walked round the old building which is just one level and saw all kinds of seafood products, many of them still alive. Afterwards we entered the new 3 storey building and saw more of the same. The market sells about 150 tons of seafood a day. You van purchase the seafood from the vendors and take it upstairs to the restaurants who will cook it the way you want and add side dishes (for a price). There is also an area where they sell dried marine products but the whole fish market was one of the highlights in Seoul.", July 2018

84,4.0,Fun and exciting experience,"Fun and adventurous experience. There is an old and new side of the market. I personally prefer the old side, which you will access directly if you came from the train station. It‚Äôs definitely wet and dirty but you enjoy such an unique experience! Honestly most of the stores sell similar items, and I kind of got overwhelmed from them trying to sell their seafood. Some were extra friendly and allowed us to take pictures with their lobsters and even octopus! My favorite part was trying raw octopus (10k won for 4 small ones). I would definitely try it again. Being a little squirmish, I started with small tentacles and kept chewing on it. I didn‚Äôt experience getting sucked by the tentacles thankfully. The freshness and delicious flavor is a huge draw for me! The drawbacks of the market was that the prices were a little high - 190k won for tiger striped fish sashimi and 170k won for crab. The ladies brought us to the restaurant behind (quite old looking and abit shabby). We were charged 100k won for the cooking and other dishes (ban chan, rice) for 9 adults and 2 Children. The tiger striped fish was served as sashimi and the bones were boiled as spicy or non spicy soup. The crab was boiled and tasted very sweet. The fat from the shell was then used to fry rice with seaweed for about 3 portions - tasted very good too. I don‚Äôt know if you can haggle much but it is definitely worth it to check out a few stores before deciding which to go to. One of my favorite experiences in my trip to Seoul/Jeju!", June 2018
85,3.0,Thing get pricy after cook,"Bought a king crab and abalone with some freebies (prawn, scallop, optopus..etc). Was lead to a restaurant upstair to cook our stuff. Was told that restaurant will charge 3k won (restaurant asked for 5k during billing, and we told them we was told 3k before we came up)per pax for cook services, but in actual there some hidden cost associated with each dishes. The 3k is only cover the king crab, cooking scallop and the rest all need extra k. End up the cook services we paid for is equal to the stuff we bought. (Mean total cost became double). We got our stuff at the new market which is just next to the old one. Don‚Äôt be hurry to get your stuff, walk and ask around. Ask each item‚Äôs cook service. As for the taste, seriously just so so only the way they cook it. (Usually either steam or baked)", June 2018

87,4.0,Fresh Seafood,"Always wanted to visit this fish market for seafood so i ask my Korean guide to bring me there. As i was with my Korean guide, ask her to help shop for seafood. Ended up with a large whole lobster, 1 kg of scallops and another kg of tiger prawns and the stallholder threw in a 2 or 3 fresh abalone. Didn't think the prices were cheap but i just had a craving for seafood.A restaurant staff member is usually nearby and would handle the fresh seafood and lead us up to his shop. At the restaurant i was brought to, it was 8000 per pax for steaming and grilling my purchase with the usual free flow of side dishes, rice and water. Seafood soup and drinks were at an additional cost. The lobster, scallops and abalone were really well prepared and tasty, the prawns so-so. For a total of 6 pax, we spend a total of 210000 won or about USD 30 per person and my stomach was really full. Don't know if it was expansive for Korean standards but from where i come from, it is reasonable price for fresh seafood especially having a huge whole lobster for lunch.", June 2018
88,4.0,"A little scary, but so glad I went!","So I've got 2-3 hours left in my 12 hour Seoul layover before I have to catch the AREX back to the airport in time for my flight. What to do? Shoehorn another palace in there? Maybe Namsan tower? Nah... I'm going to the fish market because I want to try live octopus!It took a little longer than I planned to get there, and by now I'm starting to chicken out. Maybe I'll just take pictures, I start to think...But sellers are pretty aggressive... and one thing leads to another, so pretty soon I'm bargaining for octopus. But still I think it's probably not going to work out, because I don't speak any Korean. But soon, a diner who speaks English comes forward to help me out and tell me how it works. I pay the seller 2000 won for the octopus, take it, wiggling in a plastic bag full of water, to a restaurant around the corner (more like a few tables and plastic chairs with not exactly the most pristine looking kitchen), I pay the kitchen lady 3000 won and watch her chop it up and put a little sauce on it... and soon the octopus emerges -still wiggling but in pieces now -along with some Korean hot sauce and a couple side dishes. The pieces don't want to stay on my chopsticks, so she gives me a fork. It was delicious. I still wasn't too sure I did a wise thing. But then I watched another lady buy a styrofoam crate full of live octopi from the same seller. She picks one up, and lowers it into her mouth, whole! Wiggling tentacles and all. Sauce? We don't need no stinkin' sauce!So I guess it's Ok... I'm thinking I'll find out within 24 hours... or perhaps during my 12 hour flight home. A week has gone by now and I'm fine. The poor octopi... less so. Seek out new experiences.... but carry activated charcoal just in case.  Caveat: While I spent a grand total of 5 dollars on my whole experience, I've read reviews of people who've been ripped off. I think I got lucky. The Korean diner who helped me out said that it cost him 3000 won to cover his table. Granted, all I had was octopus for one. A multi-course seafood feast would probably cost more, but I can't imagine it should really cost the exorbitant prices some people are paying. Probably best to go with a local.", June 2018
89,1.0,Ripoff experience,"We bought the seafood at reasonable prices but the cooking was very expensive.  We paid just as much for the cooking as for the seafood.

We stir fried some items which was measly onions and carrots...What exactly am I paying almost $20 CAD for as we provided the seafood.Complete ripoff, stay away...you can get much better value at the various markets (Namdaemun market, Dongdaemun, etc..)", May 2018

94,1.0,Return Visit,"Wrote a review in Nov 2016 and I raved about it. I'll take those words back. Given my previous experience, I decided to bring my parents there this time. Lo and behold, the prices have at least tripled due to high exports to China. Stall owners were all ferocious Chinese ladies and when i tried to bargain a little (I'm not even someone good at bargaining), they shouted and told me to get lost. I tried to find some of the ajummas I was acquainted with before but I couldn't find them at all. This place has been invaded by Chinese merchants and prices are exorbitant. Sadly, I cannot recommend this place anymore.", April 2018
95,4.0,Unique & Fresh,"Fresh seafood to choose from, then choose your cooking style. Consists of the old and new market. I recommend the new market and select your seafood from the second floor (more selections at individual stalls allowing for better pricing).  Then to the restaurant to cook. We checked out the restaurants first, found the one we liked and they escorted us to the seafood stall to select. Not cheap but good and fresh and reasonable.", May 2018

After negotiating, they took down the price to W150,000 (US$150).  Took the seafood to a cafeteria type of restaurant upstairs which cooked all of the above + 3 Cass beers for W86,000 (US$80).  All the foods were steamed and grilled, but the clams were made into a soup.  All these cookings for W86,000???   The next day, we went to fancy supermarkets and found that the abalones at Galleria and Shinsegae were sold at the same price as the seafood market at W40,000/kg.  What the point of going there if the price is the same as a fancy supermarket???Oh, the shrimps were not even fresh cos it stinks really bad after cooked!Not worth coming!  A tourist-trap, avoid at any cost!!!", April 2018
101,4.0,Similar to Addiction Aquatic Development in Taiwan,"Very similar concept with the Addiction Aquatic Development in Taiwan that I visited recently. (I'm sure the latter got the concept from here). There is the old and new wing; I went to the new wing as it is indoors and the weather was just too cold for me. Upon entering, there are many stalls selling similar seafood at similar prices e.g. krw80000 per kg of King Crab, abalone at krw10000/pc, krw10000/2pcs, krw10000/4pcs, depending on the size. Most sales are based on weight so it might be a good idea to ask for the item to be weighed before committing. As most stalls are selling at similar prices, you might want to take a walk and soak in the oceanic atmosphere before buying from the lucky stall. Also, many of the sellers speak Mandarin so bargaining was easy. Other than giving a discount, the sellers might also throw in a few free shrimps or clams to sweeten the deal. After buying, the seller would send you up to their preferred / recommended restaurant on the 2nd floor to prepare your meal. There are generally 2 types of sitting in the restaurants; either the chair or the floor. You don't get to choose the restaurant so I ended up sitting on the floor for my meal, which was pretty uncomfortable. However, the prices are again standardize throughout the restaurants, i.e. krw5000/cover, krw7000/kg for steaming, so you don't have to worry about being overcharged.", April 2018

After bought our seafood, we followed the seller to a restaurant with our fresh live seafood, but the cooker was very mediocre, over cooked, rubbery, salty.

Inside the building that houses the fish market, there are rows and rows of stalls selling seafood. We chose a stall to buy some seafood for lunch. After some bargaining, we bought a Snow Crab (1kg+), 6pcs of medium sized fresh Abalone, 6pcs of large Prawns, 10pcs of Scallops; all for KRW130,000. They stall operator recommended a restaurant upstairs that could cook the seafood for a fee. The restaurant, Dragon Palace, charges exorbitant price for cooking the seafood that we bought from the stall in the market. For all the seafood to be cooked, we were charged KRW80,000 (61% of what our seafood cost). We asked for a breakdown and we were given a ridiculous explanation.Therefore, I would recommend anyone who is interested to make a visit to check out the vast variety of seafood available. You should only buy the seafood IF you are staying in an accommodation with cooking facilities (bring the seafood back to your accommodation to cook).", January 2018

We simply went to the restaurant and waited for our food. We tried the uncooked sea intestine and octopus (i.e. sashimi). It was excitied and funny that you could feel the octopus moving in your throat. The chef just added sesame oil and salt on the sea intestine and octopus but it was superb tasty.

I had the best salmon and tuna sashimi ever.I think i got to pay a bit too much for it (Thanks for being a foreigner) but totally worth it.At the local restaurant there, what a great service and the staff is cool.

The seafood as you see on the pics cost 55,000 won while the cooking came up to be another 51,400!  I questioned the Chinese speaking restaurant staff on the breakdown to know that she was so hostile and not even bother to explain!

Am unsure if we got scammed slightly by the Chinese vendor.The idea is to buy the fresh/live seafood from one of the vendors at the wet market section. The vendor will then bring you and your paid seafood up to a restaurant in another place, where the restaurant will cook your seafood for a small fee.The experience overall was still memorable as we had live octopus.

You can bye and take the stuff on the top floor which is lined with several restaurants.  They will cook for you for some charges.  So, visit during lunch or dinner.  And if you want to see the actual local flavor, visit the market early morning (1.00 a.m.) when auction is held.  Metro: Noryangjin (Line 1) exit 1 or 8 (not far from Seoul Railway Station).", October 2017
126,2.0,"Used to love the old market, dislike the new characterless and expensive market",This is our second visit after 3 years. All I can say is the new market is a total disappointment. Characterless and lots of foreigners selling IMPORTED(so much more salmon being sold and prawns from south east Asia for example) expensive seafood. As the number of stalls have increased I see that most of the live seafood is not as fresh ie most are oxygen starved in crowded tanks. At the restaurants it is all about $. No longer a great local experience this has become just another place to eat expensive seafood especially if you dont speak the language., December 2017
127,5.0,New experience in seeking seafood cuisine,"Eating at Noryangjin is not a novelty. I have been to many countries that do the same. But still there is something special about the place. How is how it works. Go look for the food (fresh) in the market. Pick the food you and at the price you want to pay. The seller will accompany you to the row of restaurant that will be so willing to cook it for you. Here is the difference. The variety span from huge snow crabs to oysters. Everything fresh (and moving). My kid was thrilled by the octopus. The sellers do allow him to play with the creature. The best of the whole buying experience is, you can pay by your credit card! Prices are very reasonable. I got the whole snow crab, abalone, sea cucumber, octopus, scallops for US$138. Have that cooked add the fried rice mixed into the crab shell, a hotpot soup and throw in a couple of drinks for another US$78. Total damage for a feast slightly over $200 that can feed 3-4 persons.", November 2017

129,5.0,Awesome place to eat fresh seafood,It is not far as you can take 2 stops by subway from Seoul station. It is a big fresh fish market that sells everything those can swim. After buying seafood downstairs you are guided to upstairs where there are many restaurants that help tou cook. It costs a little bit more but it is worth as the food is so great. Try king-crab and sashimi!, November 2017
130,4.0,Go for the King Crab - that's the only highlight,"Noryangjin market is a definite place that you should come to if you are looking for a large size King Crab meal.Getting to this location is best by the subway, rather than taxi - during dinner time, the traffic was horrible and i had a pounding headache at the end of the taxi journey.lots of stalls selling King Crabs with various owners telling you why their crabs are better. You definitely need to bargain, do not be afraid to make a low bid, if the stall is sticky on the price, get them to give other freebies like clams, prawns, or abalones etcwe order also abalones, clams, prawns & sashimi. my verdict is that other than the King Crabs, the rest of the fare are simply average.after you order the food, it is passed over to another representative from a shop that will cook the crab for you. They charge a fee for the cooking and steam is the best way to have the crab IMO.", November 2017

A varied experience . Never thought of visiting a fish market especially in a different country since my country is full of markets and fishes..., October 2017
132,5.0,Cheap place for seafood,A must visit if you are a seafood lover. But take note that there are the original old fish market and the new fish market (a newer building) just next to the old one. The price at the old market is definitely much more cheaper (about half price) as compared to the new market. Order whatever seafood u like from the stall and the ahjuma will call their restaurant contact to bring you to have the seafood cook and eat at the restaurant. Walk around to compare the price but majority of them sell the same things and you can bargain abit for better pricing., November 2017
133,3.0,Just okay...,"This place was just okay. We checked out both the old market and the new market. Definitely the place to go to if you want live fish or crabs but I noticed most of their shrimp were frozen. Came for the live squid sashimi but you can also get that the Gwangjang market and would not have to travel far. Wished we had a Korean speaker with us as most of the vendors don‚Äôt speak English. Overall, probably not a place I would go to again.", November 2017
134,4.0,Smelly great place,"It's smelly, fishy, but if you want a fresh yummy seafood then this is the place to go. It cannot get any fresher. you choose a fish that swims in a big water tank and after 20 minutes the fish you chosen is on the table for you to eat. Big, loud, usually crowded, get there early in the morning for the best deals.", February 2017
135,5.0,Fresh live seafood experience!,There are many seafood vendors to choose from and restaurants upstairs to cook your food.  There are comments about this place being expensive.  Yes....you are not going to get a live king crab for $50 here.  But it still will be a bargain compared to what you pay in the US.  Also if you are spending some big cash don't be afraid to ask for some free extras for the vendors.   Overall I would highly recommend coming here at least once for the experience and to get some super fresh seafood., June 2017
136,3.0,Fresh seafood but pricey for cooked items ,"This place is visited by their locals as well. Take subway to Noryangjin station exit 1. Walk across the bridge and you will come to this open air space/carpark, turn right and walk for another 3 meters. You will see a stairs with some Chinese words scribbled on the wall. 2 floors down and you will see the wet market. Prices are quite competitive. We walked 1 round and decided to settle for one of the stalls with local customers. Some stalls can communicate in Mandarin. 5 pieces of scallops ‚Ç©10000, 5 Xlarge prawns ‚Ç©10000, 5 small abalone ‚Ç©10000, 1 small fish ‚Ç©20000, 1 bag clams ‚Ç©10000. Simple cooking ie: bbq, steaming, stir fried (clams), pot of soup (fish) costs ‚Ç©38000. Whole meal costs us ‚Ç©98000 for 2 pax. Price did not include rice or drinks. I would say can come for the experience like witnessing your fish being killed in front of you etc. For cheaper alternative, go for sashimi style like most of the locals. You can't get to choose which shop to cook your food as it's all designated by the stalls.", October 2017
137,1.0,Pricey pricey,Be prepared for lots of accosting from the stallholders when you set into the place. The seafood is pricey and bringing it upstairs to the restaurant for sit-in meal is even more pricey. Not worthwhile to pay for the experience. We had better experience at a seafood restaurant in Myeongdong - fresh seafood and better value for $$., October 2017
138,4.0,Fresh seafood !!!,"We enjoyed our fresh seafood where we tried the live octupus, crab, fish where there are restaurants available to cook them for us. Price is a bit high maybe compared to Busan Jagachi market", October 2017
139,3.0,Just for the experience,There is a new and old market. The new one is cleaner and doesn't smell as much as the old one. Bought the seafood from the new place and bring it up to 2nd floor for them to cook. There's a lot of restaurants to choose from and prices are similar. But it is not cheap to eat there. Buying the seafood is already pricey enough. Letting them cook is expensive too. The charges are depending on what type of method you want them to cook. Total bill comes out to over $100 for 2 of us when we did not even order alot. I think eating out will be cheaper than this. I think there are more locals going there to buy the seafood to cook at home rather than asking the restaurants to cook. They charge a $5 USD for individual seating. The restaurant did recommend what type of style to go with the type of seafood but seems like everything they say best fit is grilled.Just an experience but probably not worth going again., May 2017
140,5.0,Must come!!,"Highly recommend this place if you are a seafood lover! Totally spoilt for choices here and the price is reasonable! First, you choose a stall and pick your seafood ( you pay for the price of seafood) then the stall owner will ask if you have a preferred restaurant in mind, if not they will recommend. Then they will take you to the restaurant and you can choose how you would like your seafood to be cooked! Steam, bbq, sashimi etc.. and you pay for the price of how it‚Äôs being cooked. It‚Äôs such an interesting experience for us! Do drop by! And it‚Äôs 24 hours!!", October 2017
141,5.0,A 100% must in Seoul ,"This is one of the most remarkable and unique experiences of the trip. There, you truly enjoy the Korean experience. A lot of young Koreans go there for dates or just to eat and drink with friends. If you like fresh and good quality seafood this is a total must! There is a metro station in front of the market so it's easy to get there. Note that there are two markets, the old and new one. I recommend to go to the new one since it's cleaner. The main idea here is to buy seafood in the first floor and then go upstairs (2nd floor) and go to a restaurant so they can cook it. There are plenty restaurants that offer the services, in fact I believe they only do that. They charge aprox 5,000 won per person so it's mad cheap. Also, while you are buying seafood sometimes you can find the ""agents"" of the restaurants upstairs so it's easier to talk to them rather than go upstairs without someone that can help you out. We bought: 1 kg of mid size shrimp 1 kg of live large scallops, half a pound of fresh salmon (in Korea you get very good quality salmon, they fly it in every day), 2 live flounders (1.5 kg each) , 1 live seabass (approx 2kg) for a total of 138,000 won (130 dollars). We were 8 people and we were all full. Note that you will have to negotiate always. Try to buy shellfish and fish from one person so they can make a bundle deal. You can deduct btw 10-20% of the starting price. The whole experience was amazing. Way better than see temples and palaces, this was truly Korean", October 2017
142,3.0,It's visit ( shouldn't be priorities) but expensive ,"Well it's ok to visit if you just have extra time.

150,3.0,Seafood Feast (Oct 2015),"We skipped breakfast to visit this market for branch. The market is situated in a large building right next to the Noryangjin metro station. Once inside, the large building has a mezzanine floor for restaurants, and the main floor was just for selling tons and tons of seafood. Once you have picked them, you could bring them to the restaurants to cook for a fee. And so we walked around to pick some seafood, when up to a restaurant recommended by one of the seafood counter-owners. The different seafood we bought were obviously ok because they were all fresh, and we actually had lobster sashimi for breakfast! However, prices were not cheap, so don‚Äôt expect too much -- just tread it as a place to go for a walk and a bite.", October 2016

We were only there for a short time but we saw jumbo-sized shrimps, lobsters, king crabs and lots of other sea creatures that I had never seen before. It's a nice place to buy your fish and have it cooked or fillet the way you wanted. We wanted to grab so much stuff but had other stops along the way. Wish we had more time so we could eat there!", December 2016

155,5.0,Unique and unforgettable experience,"The market was located near the subway station and was easily accessible.Choosing your seafood and have it cooked at the 2nd level is indeed a very unique experience for my family of 8.We didnt really look around different stalls and were approached by the 1st stall when we stepped in. As we saw some locals buying from the stall as well, we thought the pricing shd be reasonable. We paid 98k won for 1 king crab, prawns, clams, salmon, 7 abalone, octopus and a local fish. Seafood itself is cheap. The expensive part is getting a seat in the restaurant and getting it cook. i paid 88k won for 8 pax seats and steaming of most of the items and 1 bottle of korean beer. sashimi preparation is foc. I have the fish half in sashimi and half in soup. Overall i think the price is considered reasonable for the freshness and also unique experience. It is cheaper than eating the same items in my country. This place is one of the must see in my list.", June 2017

Price is very good so this is a paradise for seafood lovers!  this is one of my favorite place in Seoul!", June 2017
157,3.0,Very expensive,"This place is more for locals or tourists with a local guide. It's a typical wet fish market. Most of the seafood are still alive. I had to walk for quite sometime before a gentleman greeted me in English. Apparently, he speaks Mandarin too. So, lucky for us. He explained that I had to choose my seafood from his stall and then follow a lady to a restaurant where the seafood will be cooked and prepared. You have to pay the fish monger for the seafood and pay the restaurant for their service separately. There are a few restaurants so if you're picky, you might want to check out the restaurants first. The price was rather steep but we got to sit with the locals, on the floor, in the restaurant.", June 2017
158,4.0,Fresh Seafood you must try,"It is a must go place for me as I love fresh salmon sashimi and it's my dream to try the king crab at least once in my lifetime. There's alot of things that you need to take note before going here. Your ability to speak basic Korean can determine whether you love or hate the experience. Bargain hard, it's your right! If they refuse to give discounts, ask for service, they might throw in some prawns or octopus for you :) Do not just buy from the first stall you see, explore around and find one with a good deal. Another important note, if you plan to dine here, there will be extra charges from the restaurant and this may vary in prices. So, ask their charges first before even agreeing to enter their restaurant. I will be going back again this year!", December 2016
159,5.0,Fresh Seafood,"Heard about the Noryangjin fish market - so we decided to make a trip to try out some seafood. Took the subway and it was conveniently located near the Noryangjin station with just about a 10min walk. There were many stores selling almost the same things. Basically you pick some seafood (be sure to bargain) and checkout several stores first before buying. They will then bring you up to a restaurant where they will cook for you.Overall we were very satisfied with the seafood - fresh, well prepared and yummy.The only thing to note is that thy will charge you for cooking the seafood etcThy charge by weight but you'll never know how much thy actually weigh. We paid about  USD40 for cooking of lobsters, abalone, Scallop, prawns etc including drinks.But it's a good experience and satisfying dinner !", June 2017

161,5.0,"If you like seafood, this is the place to come to in Seoul!","This fish market is smaller than the Tsukiji one in Tokyo, but there is one big difference, you can actually select the seafood (most are still alive) and have them deliver to a restaurant on the second floor to have it prepared the way you like. There are dozens of stalls each with tanks of live seafood - it is fascinating just walking from stall to stall and looking at the seafood. I was lucky to come with a local Korean so language is no barrier. The lobster and crab were huge - but for two of us, we selected abalones, clams and a fish. The fish was prepared 3 ways - Sashimi, grilled and the bones used as delicious fish soup. The abalone was grilled with butter while the clams were steamed. It was absolutely delicious. It was mid-priced - not cheap, but given the freshness and convenience, definately worth coming back.", June 2017

We did end up having a conversation in chinese (through my partner) and were advised you buy the seafood, take it upstairs to a restaurant who charges you $30,000 won to sit in the restaurant and then you pay a per kilo cooking fee.  We opted out as it was too hard to work out watch you would actually pay although the seafood all looked great.Well worth the visit.", July 2017
164,1.0,Rip off. Beware!,Not the first time here. Did it to re-experience from 3 years ago at the old market.Bought a large lobster & crab for $200.Then the restaurant (named Hwang Jae) charged me $60 to steam them.  $60??? WTF? Never again.The lobster was over cooked and the crab was way too salty., July 2017

I have been here twice. The old one and the new one. You really have to shop around and check out the price per kg etc. Once you see the stall with the reasonable prices, get them to weigh every seafood and record the weight.* After that don't follow the runner. I got overcharged for the cooking fee at a restaurant named dragon head or something operating by some Chinese. 7,000 and/or 10,000 won per kg. Immediate regret. It has free wifi though. Walk around on the upper floors and ask the price. Not worth your time unless you have time to spare and you wanna eat live abalone. Go to the old market. I will never come back again. It is really a ripoff.", May 2017

The worst part is we still had to pay another 60,000Won at the 1st floor small restaurant just for the seafood to be grilled !!!I personally DO NOT recommend this place for seafood as it was a Total Rip-Off !!!", July 2016
167,4.0,Lots of sea creatures ,A very nice market to visit. I had never seen most of the sea creatures there b4. It smells alot but you can endure it. I think the market is worth a visit. If I lived in Seoul I would buy different fishes and now a meal. But as tourist is a shame not be able to do so Take the metro and take the exit 7 I think....look at the exitmap an follow wich exit u need to take. When you exit the metro... just go straight about 5 min. Then turn right...follow the tunnel (Lots of older women selling vegetables there) to the end and you see the noryangjin market....first you see the new building and at the right side of the building there is the old market. My favourite was the old part., June 2017
168,2.0,Torts Are Everywhere,"New market is clean, bright and very different from other seafood market.We were there to understand and experience the different kinds of seafood that be found in Seoul.Varieties are great and fascinating.However, TORTING is very rampant to a point it was very disturbing. It seems that the absence of PRC tour groups have deeply impacted the business.It will good if the authority can look into this else the TORTS will severely impact the reputation of the fish market", June 2017
169,3.0,Go once justfor the experience,"It's a fish market so expect the noise and smell. The old market (nearer to train station) is still operating however places to have your bought seafood cooked is limited and dinghy looking. So we did not buy any seafood but just walked straight through onto the newer market. New market is better lit, better laid out but still wet and fish smelling! Almost all vendors sell the same variety of seafood so unless you want to patiently scout and compare for the cheapest or you could just target one stall and negotiate for the best price you are willing to pay. Becoz it's a tourist trap you are bound to get fleeced regardless. A young Chinese speaking tout followed us around the entire  market which made us feel really uncomfortable. Eventually he confessed that he wanted us to come with him to the restaurant he worked for upstairs to get the seafood cooked. Pls note this cost is separate so do budget for another KRW7k-10k per separate dish to be cooked. There were some hard negotiations between us and the owner and they kept insisting all shops will charge the same for cooking fees therefore no need to price hunt anymore. Totally I paid KRW85,000 for small Alaskan crab, KRW10,000 for 4 small abalones, KRW15,000 for 6 small sea urchins = KRW110K plus another KRW25k for steaming and side dishes. Don't follow the tout, although the restaurant he brought us to was clean, the service was poor and servers try to push sell you with the more ways to cooked seafood and extra costs of course! Do price research prior to going back to", June 2017

There are 2 fisherman market, we went to the old one first, was interested what the new one looks like so we didn't buy anything from the old market. The new one was just next to it - much better environment, not sure why they don't move all vendors. We bought live octopus, King Crab, Abalone, shrimp, uni and clams. A guy from one of the restaurant on 2nd floor lead us the way to the restaurant. We think the restaurant charged too much, consider we only paid $125 for all the seafood while the restaurant charged us $58... live octopus was a fun experience.", June 2017
171,4.0,Live octopus!  Need game plan to shop for seafood,"Eating live octopus is on our list for this trip.  It was fun and unique experience.  There are many fish stalls inside both new and old markets.  The sellers kept selling aggressively. So it helps if you have ideas of what kind of seafoods you want first.  Go around most of the stalls at least once before started the conversation with the sellers and until you found the one has all of seafood type you want.  The sellers started with a higher price, there's  room for negotiation if you purchased all your seafood in one stall.  Each stall works with a restaurant who will cook the seafood for you.

Our tour guide told us honestly that the seafood was expensive and it would have been cheaper to order seafood from a restaurant. Everyone was selling about the same thing. Even though there were restaurants nearby who would cook what you buy, they didn't look like places that I would eat in. Can't be compared with the Japanese seafood markets.", June 2017

Tough, if you are not a seafood or market lover, i would not recommend the visit as there are no other sights nearby. My korean Mum bought a fish that the fishmonger prepared as sashimi to eat at home (and some beef for me from another shop !) You should not expect some cheap prices because it is a large wholesale market if you buy as private. As an industrialized and rich country, prices are in Seoul generally very similar to Europe (for instance France or Italy).

This Seoul destination also functions as a eatery, complete with floor seating and table service on the upper level.

179,3.0,Accessible but expensive,"It is easy to travel there by the subway and once you tap out, you'll see many signs directing you to the market. It is tough to haggle sometimes, with sellers attempting to give you free seafood instead of lowering the price. Once you enter, it is quite likely that a local would start following and helping you to communicate with the sellers. This local would be an employee from one of the restaurants on the second level who would bring you to his restaurant subsequently where they will help cook the seafood which you have bought. Although the final cost is pricey, the seafood is indeed fresh. If you don't mind skipping the experience of the market, I would suggest just going straight to a well-known seafood restaurant in the city as the price point would be similar.", May 2017

If you want to eat, go to the second floor, there are almost 20 restaurants but they seem to sell the same food. One rule that you need to know is you have to bring your own raw seafood! People buy them from the first floor and bring to the restaurants. The standard seating charge is 3,000 won for one person which include fresh vegetables and dipping sauce. They will charge you for cooking but I did not remember the rates (standard rates for most restaurants). I bought only one tray of sashimi, no raw food for cooking so they charged me 5,000 won/person instead of 3,000 won!!!They have basic menus like fish bone soup that you won't need to have your own materials. I ordered one pot of soup and it costs around 10,000-15,000 won. In total I paid 25,000 won for the soup, two bowls of rice and seating for two people.

It is basically a huge smelly fish market where you can buy and have cooked your own food. (Quite hard to buy it due the very poor English spoken in the market). However we managed and we spent about 30 Euro for some fish( some prawns and clams). Then they bring you upstairs where a ""restaurant"" will cook for you the fish. Basically for doing some bbq and a small soup we paid over 30 euro. Considering that we were brining our own fish, I found this incredible.

We chose a plate full of sashimi after making several rounds over and over again. We tried to pick a place that didn't have overcrowded tanks and dead fish floating inside (not a good sign).  Once we picked our plate of sashimi for $20,000 won (we didn't bother to haggle but you can), we paid and they led us upstairs to a restaurant. The chopsticks and spoons are inside the side drawer of the table you are sitting at. It should be the drawer facing the aisle.We ordered Makouli (Korean alcohol) and at checkout (you pay at the register) it was $10,000 won which we thought was very pricey for 1 Makouli bottle since it's super cheap at any 7-11 or convenience store. Great experience but wouldn't order alcohol again.", April 2017

While the new is nice, I definitely recommend the old for cooked dishes - go, pick out your fish and seafood and the vendor will bring you to a partner restaurant for them to cook it up for you on the spot. While we did not get it, the king crab looked to be quite popular. We got some clams, scallops and the live octopus, which forewarning, is not for the faint of heart. It's a little bit creepy how it still moves even after the dish is served, but it was our hands down favorite part of the meal - a must try for any adventurous foodie! Don't fill up in this section however, go to the new part of the market and get a platter of fresh sashimi - but a warning, the vendors will try and bring you to a partner restaurant where you have to pay a table fee.

The first time we bought some large prawns and abalone which we then had cooked for us in one of the restaurants upstairs.The second time we went all out for a huge snow crab with a big plate of sashimi. It was cooked and prepared for us upstairs. We ate in many places while we were in Seoul including Michelin star food but this was the best meal of the week!Well worth a visit even if you are not planning to eat but do eat if you have time - it is a great experience.

200,5.0,Great experience!,"Vin Merlot, Mrs Merlot and son young Merlot travelled by subway to this market for the experience. Vin hails from a long line of fishmongers, having started at the Melbourne fish market when he was 7 years old helping Papa Merlot.The great advantage of this market is that whatever you choose to purchase you can take upstairs to be cooked for you in one of the many restaurants. We arrived about 10am which was a non busy time with many vendors and restaurants having a mid morning break but still serving.The women vendors were dressed in pink aprons. We witnessed the full range of sales techniques from friendly and helpful, to a little forward but with good humour to plain pushy and no humour!!We weren't hungary but bought half kilo of prawns to have them cooked upstairs. I am surprised by some of the TAs views that it was expensive. Half kilo of good size prawns 14000Kwon (approx $AUD  14). Cooking price with green tea for three, plus condiments 16,000 Kwon (approx $AUD 16). We thought that was fair plus restaurant staff very helpful, despite little English but they somehow twigged we were ""kangaroo"".Then went back downstairs to the old market part to return to a fishmonger who had been helpful in explaining his products in limited English. Needless to say he was delighted and probably surprised to see us but we bought a large plate of sashimi 20,000 Kwon (approx $AUD  20) and a fillet of salmon a bit more than half a kilo for 20,000 Kwon all of which 4 of us have eaten tonight.Perhaps pick your time and we're closed shoes and you will have great time.

You get to see some fresh seafood but it gets repetitive. They will push you to buy fresh seafood and will bring you to a bunch of restaurants upstairs and charge you exorbitantly to cook it.

My wife and I came around 6pm and the market was so crowded with locals! After we bought our seafood ingredients, the restaurants were full and we were stranded with no place to go. I almost wanted to give up because we were hungry and it was hard to communicate with the locals. After almost an hour, we finally found a table to settle down and got our ingredients cooked and served. That was when the night got slightly better. The highlight of the night was the live octopus. Loved it. Not cheap, I guess.Throughout our dinner, two local guys who sat beside us even shared their sashimi with me. They spoke basic English and they were very polite.

Very clean and no smell foul that you normally have in a wet market. Ocean products comes in different varieties of types and sizes. You have options on the restaurants that prepare the food. You can do traditional sitting, low table(cross-leg) or with the standard chair and table. We did the traditional settings and I did survived the cross legged for an hour. A very good experience and a must see. You should be able to speak korean or have a good tour guide in buying and preparing the food. Excellent food.", January 2017

209,5.0,the most original place in seoul,"once you arrive with the metro to noryangjin stop you will have to pass trough the railway station , there is some small streets or a bridge.  be also careful there is to fish market , the traditional and 50 meters after the new market, you have to see both", February 2017
210,4.0,a fishmarket that's bit different from what you might have seen before,"we got here very early in the morning and the place was packed. What's different about this market is that it has an enormous amount of fish tanks. What you may not like is seeing alive and dead fish in the same tank but to me it beats seeing live fish on a tray with no water and they're gasping for air. The selection of mussels, small and large fish, crabs, etc. is pretty incredible. You can take an escalator and see things from above to get a better view. It wasn't overly smelly there. Been to many where the stench was overbearing.", January 2017
211,4.0,Fresh experience ,"Bargain, bargain, bargain. It can be tiring if one doesn't like it. So Noryangin may be a one-off experience for us. King crab was fabulous tho it's was only boiled. Grilled abalone was to die for.Best prices we got for the seafood before cooking:King crab: KRW155K for 2.8kg ++ crabAbalone: KRW10K for 3 good sized onesWish you guys luck!", December 2016
212,4.0,For seafood lovers!,I'm the grilled fish lovers so this is my best place for finding good and fresh fish in Seoul. You can find variety of fish selections at wholesale price. Everything here is fresh and still can be negotiable. There also small restaurant on 2nd floor if you want to cook right away and small stall on ground level beside the building. They also have a new fish market beside old market., January 2017
213,5.0,Very fresh seafood for Seafood Lovers,It's very big fisheries market in Seoul. Very convenience to visit by subway. There are 2 buildings (Old and New) and some items are different. It's better to visit the New Building first and go to 2nd Floor to meet visit the prospected restaurant and ask the staff or chef to go with you to select the items. He/ she can recommend you what kind of menu that suitable for each one., October 2016
214,3.0,Not very nice and pricy. Tourist trap,"Nice fish market to walk around and seafood is fresh. But the restaurants on the second floor is quite pricy. 3000won to get seated per person and 10,000-15000 to cook a dish. Feels like a tourist trap as it standa", January 2017
215,4.0,Unique fish market,"Great fish market consists of two parts old and new in a modern space. Do not hesitate to choose the live fish, which will bring in a restaurant. I suggest you should try the live small octopus. Enjoy the fresh raw fish.", November 2016
216,3.0,Not worth visiting ,"Nothing compared to Tsukiji Japan. Not worth visiting. You basically shop for seafood downstairs and bring it to 2nd floor where you can choose a restaurant to cook for you. But .. Cost $3000 w per person service charge for seating in the restaurant. Cooking charges is $7000 w per dish. For 4 dishes and 4 person - need to pay $40,000w, that's with zero food. Prawns, abalone are charge by per kg.", December 2016
217,3.0,Restaurant was a rip off. ,"While asking around for directions from the Noryanjin station, we bumped into one of the restaurant chefs. Though her, we were introduced to the wholesaler. The first good point about this fish market is that by linking up with the restaurants before buying the seafood saves you money. We bought 10 scallops and 1 Grouper fish at 10,000 won and 20,000 won respectively. That was good value because they were charging us twice the amount before realizing that we already had 'connections' with the restaurant.Unfortunately, the dining experience was a huge let down. The scallops were too salty , and the fish had too much seasoning for a fresh seafood. We couldn't taste the essence of a live seafood. Secondly, they charged us additional 10,000 won and 15,000 for cooking the scallops and fish. On top of that, 4,000 won for me and my mum for seating.While the fresh seafood is cheap and good, the dining experience was a bummer. It  might be that sole restaurant called 'The Chef' that was a poor choice on our part.", January 2017
218,1.0,"Thumbs down, really.","The reason I rate this place terribly is because I am comparing this place to the many fish markets I have visited before in Japan, Taiwan and China. Fresh seafood is a given and what else do you expect? However, the cooking is another matter. At Tsukiji in Tokyo, you eat exquisite sashimi and sushi. Fresh fish cooked in Chinese style brings out the delicate texture of the fish. Noryangjin is a letdown in the dining aspect. The only exception is the grilled Alaskan crab.The ground level is where fresh seafood is sold but it is advisable not to buy yet. It is more important to go upstairs and get a table in any of the restaurants. The restaurants have linked up with the vendors anyway and will get the type of seafood you desire. If you have not been to a fish market, then Noryangjin or other seafood markets in South Korea would be an eye opener otherwise it is nothing unique. Allocate 10-20 minutes of exploring a section of the vast market then head upstairs for lunch or dinner. Avoid peak period if you do not have any reservation.", December 2016
219,5.0,Worth Visiting if You're Willing to Bargain,"PRICE: We went to the old fish market (right next to the new fish market) b/c that's where it seemed like most of the locals were going. The only issue is that you have to speak Korean/Chinese in order to bargain properly in that environment. The prices are very fluid and rather than decrease the price of the seafood that you want, it seems more effective to try to get more of each item given a certain price (ie. 4 octopus for 10,000W rather than 3 octopus). Despite probably being overcharged (b/c we're very obviously foreigners with our cameras and all), the pricing was decent.QUALITY: All the seafood at the market is very fresh and pretty good quality. I personally think everyone should try the live octopus and the tuna. If you go early enough and ask around, you can get them to cut out a fresh portion of the entire tuna belly for a decent price (maybe 50,000W?).RESTAURANT: We originally went to a restaurant deep in the old fish market on the first floor, but the lady was very aggressive and wanted to overcharge us (3000W per person for seating and side dishes + 20,000W to cook the food after a lot of bargaining [we didn't buy that much food, plus the lady at the entrance of the market that we spoke to told us that she wasn't going to charge us for sashimi, so we could always go back to her as a fall-back plan]), so we left. Instead we went to a restaurant on the second floor (the middle of the market) which immediately charged us 27,000W to prepare all of the food for us (no bargaining needed!). Furthermore, the second floor restaurant was a lot cleaner and had a better overall ambience, so we went with the restaurant on the second floor.", January 2017
220,4.0,Worth visiting,It was an eye opener to see such wide varieties of seafood. You can choose from over 50 stalls. Most of them can speak mandarin but not so much on English.  Of course cooking of the seafood will be additional cost. I would recommend going to the old market as it has a traditional fish market feel., December 2016
221,5.0,Eye opener! Frash seafood at great prices! ,This place is highly recommended for all tourists! The seafood was fresh and fantastic! The price was very reasonable too. There are 3 restaurants around that will cook your seafood buys for you. Will definitely come back again!, December 2016
222,1.0,Over priced and lots of haggling,"We initially wanted to have our dinner at the market, after hearing that we can pick our fresh fishes and have them cooked. The market was large, with many stores neatly arranged in rows selling almost the same thing. This has obviously caused a lot of competition among the stall holders. Seeing us as a large group (12 of us), we were being tugged and haggled by almost every stall to buy from them. Mistaking us from mainland China, they started speaking mandarin to us. We stopped at a stall to inquire on the price of the king crab, which is apparently in season, and was shocked that it will cost us 200,000 Won (cost of cooking not included). Since we are a big group, we will need 2 crabs....! Now, this is much more expensive then in Japan or even at the seafood restaurant back home. Frustrated, we left the place and decided on dinner elsewhere.", December 2016
223,5.0,King Crab Feast!,"We actually visited both old and new market but decided for the new for hygiene sake. It's definitely worthwhile to get your hands on to the king crab that you will never able to get in SG for $120, at 2.2Kg! We also got ourselves a big plate of fresh salmon at $12 and 2 tiger prawns and 4 small abalones for $24! Tell me now, where to get? But do note that buying of the seafood and the restaurant fees are different. Thus you will need to pay extra cooking fee when you eat in-house at level 2.", December 2016
224,4.0,See-food,"Local markets are always a sight to behold, as they exude so much of the local culture. In terms of uniqueness, markets will always be markets, but that doesn't mean the Noryangjin Market is not worth the time.In fact, come prepared with your cameras to capture some of the most amazing seafood up for sale in this market. You can see a lot of different seafood up close, such as stingrays, abalone, lobsters, crabs and even eels. Just be sure not to stay at each stall for too long and take too many photos, because some shop owners will not be pleased and are generally intolerant with tourists. Some owners will be outrightly displeased and may even scream at you, but that is just how they are, so as long as you ignore them you will be fine.If you do love sashimi, choose a friendly shop owner and they will recommend the freshest fish to you. Of course, coming in a big group and ordering more will also mean that you can get bigger discounts. One thing I recommend is to try sannakji (ÏÇ∞ÎÇôÏßÄ), which is live octopus. Be careful, though, as the tentacles may suck onto your tongue, so be sure to chew it thoroughly before swallowing it. It is a pretty unique experience that you should try since you are already there anyway.To get there, take Seoul Subway Line 1 to Noryangjin Station, and get out from exit 1. You will cross a small overhead bridge over the train tracks, and then walk down several flights of stairs to the market.", October 2016
225,4.0,Good place for fresh seafood,"It is easy to get here by train.   Short walk (200m) through an ally and you will reach this market.   You may get a lot of fresh seafood and plenty of restaurants can prepare seafood selected by you.  I suggest you cook them yourself if you stay in Seoul long enough.   Since there are many Chinese visitors, price of seafood is not much cheaper than those in local market.   Worth to pay a visit if you love seafood.", December 2016
226,1.0,Market was interesting but......,"It was a good experience at the market. The kids saw many interesting seafood. The sellers do not speak English but they speak Mandarin so it helps if you can speak Mandarin. We don't know much about the prices of seafood. We bought a king crap, lobster, 4 pc of abalone and half a portion of salmon sashimi for KRW100,000. Not sure if that is cheap. We realised that there will be a ""runner"" once they know you are going to buy some seafood so that they can set up the restaurant to cook your food. They will whisk the food away from you to the restaurant which is located behind the market. We basically had steamed crap and lobster, barbecued abalone,  fried seaweed rice (using crab roe) and salmon sashimi. The steamed lobster was not done well. The meat was hard and we could hardly eat it. Perhaps it shouldn't be steamed but this was recommended by the restaurant. The cooking of the food is a separate charge that cost us KRW60,000 for just steaming, barbecuing and 3 portions of fried rice with no drinks. I think that is very expensive considering we only paid KRW100,000 for the seafood. So be very careful with the restaurant charges. It's the most expensive meal we had in Seoul!!!", December 2016
227,4.0,Fresh & Cheap Seafood!,"Went on a Monday afternoon to avoid crowd.  Easy access via overhead bridge connecting the train station.  Walked between the old and new and had lunch at the old market.  Fresh snow crab & lobster about KRW42k each and other seafood such as bamboo clams, little oysters, prawns & live octopus about KRW10k each type.  Seller brought us to a nearby stall that help customers cook the seafood to their liking at a charge.  We paid about KRW50k for 4 pax 7 dishes.  Not sure if this is reasonable, guess depending where you come from.Remember to pickup a latte or smoothie outside the markets at a little store between both market.", December 2016
228,4.0,Cheap and fresh seafood,"Went to Noryangjin twice and bought scallops, prawns, salmon sashimi, oysters, king crab, abalones and octopus. Each time, it cost us about 50,000 won. On both occasions, we went to the same restaurant on level 2 which charged us 25,000 won with soju included. Great price for super fresh seafood! Would go back again in future!", November 2016

You can buy your fish here and bring it to the restaurants nearby to have it cooked!Try it, it's worth the experience!", August 2016
230,5.0,Seafood market,Noryangjin Fish market is a must go place for me. Every time I go to Korea I must bring my friend and my family to there and eat seafood. I like this place because you can choose seafood on the first floor and ask people there to cook it for you. Also there are people that they can speak Chinese so there is no problem for communicating how the seafood are being cooked. I think the price is not very expensive (middle price) and the taste of the seafood is very fresh. Until now I can still remember the taste of those seafood which make me want to go visit in the near future.At last I would like to recommend you check carefully for the location because it is quite hard to find that place if you are not well prepared., August 2016
231,3.0,Seafood lover's paradise,"A new complex building was opened recently. There are still stalls being operated in the old wet market though. The two are just adjacent to each other. On the second floor of the complex building are restaurants. At a certain fee, they can prepare the seafood you bought from the market for you.

233,4.0,Brand new fish market building,"Went there 2 years before at the old market which was pretty dark and wet. Heard that a new market was opened in April and we decided to give it a try again.The new building was bright and spacious but most of the vendors there were Chinese which was good for us because we came from Hong Kong. After a good bargaining on seafood, we went upstairs and entered a restaurant that had most customers. We had King crab, abalone, sushi and octopus/fish soup. Everything was very tasteful and the price was far too good compared with Hong Kong.", November 2016
234,4.0,Don't be put off by bad reviews,"Not saying they are the most honest people on earth but please do not be put off by bad comments. After reading the reviews, I nearly gave this place a miss but thankfully I didn't. Most commented about how they feel cheated about the food preparation cost. I felt that way initially but when I questioned the cost (with my limited Korean), I began to understand how it works. So the usual 5000won or so includes the side dishes, drinks and the provision of a place for you to eat. If you need then to cook season, the extra cost will depend on the amount of cooking required. So the more cooking or preparation you required for your food, you will pay more. The culinary skills does leave much to be desired. BUT since I was there for LIVE seafood, what better way than sashimi or steaming it. The natural sweetness of the fresh seafood is to die for!Expensive? Perspective here please. Needs some bargaining but it's not crazy. Most shops quoted me within a certain range. Standard prices for 4small abalones - 10,000won. Bought a king crab for 75,000won and got the lady to throw in some raw baby octopus. Found out that I probably overpaid for the crab and went back another day. The shop owner recognized me immediately and I told her to give me a discount because I overpaid the last time. No questions asked, 65,000 (approx 65usd) for a much much bigger king crab this time. And she threw in more baby octopus this time. The crab would probably cost 3 times here in Singapore so I'm not complaining. Then again, things are always so expensive here in Singapore so... it's really where you come from and the value you see in the seafood. Try it for yourself.", November 2016
235,1.0,Be careful,"We visited Noryangjin Fish market in Oct.2016. We purchased some seafood down stairs and they took us upstairs to eat.

Either steam or bbq ( fried with butter may be). The seafoods all taste the same after cooked. nothing special to me.", October 2016
239,4.0,Definitely not like how it is on TV,"After seeing this place on Travel channel I've always wanted to go. You buy what you want to eat then take it to a close by restaurant in the same building or outside area. Buying your choice of seafood is pretty fun since there's sooooo much to choose from. Then you take it to a restaurant to get it cooked or prepared for you, now here's the downfall... It seems almost no one wants to prepare what you bought but we finally found a place which was outside. It was a bit pricey seeing it's not like you have to purchase the food from the person cooking or preparing it, but all in all it was an interesting experience.", October 2016
240,4.0,"Fresh, but pricey","Worth the experience. Take exit 7 from the metro then take a right under the tunnel full of fresh veggies. The indoor seafood market is cleaner and simple to navigate. There will be english speaking guides, or yellow shirts, who can translate for the seller. They will also direct you to the 2nd floor to the restaurant.It will be a little pricey, since the fishmonger has their own set prices which you may choose to negotiate. Additionally, the upstairs restaurants will charge their standard prices.

244,4.0,DIY style is the best,"Ignore your runners (people in yellow/ blue vests that befriend you while you buy seafood) and find a good restaurant yourself. Make sure you read these reviews and know what you're doing (even if you don't). We went to a new restaurant (I'll leave a picture down) which charged us relatively cheap per kg.

The restaurant gives us condiments and sauces to eat with the sashimi. It's certainly tasty!", October 2016
247,4.0,Visited the new wing of the market ,"I came here once before the new wing is built. After reading the reviews from Trip advisor about the new wing, we decide to explore this. The new wing is further up the old wing of the market. Once you walk through the old market, you will see a new painted building( 2 storey tall). When we are there, not all the stalls are occupied. I guessed some of the old wing stalls have not moved to the nee wing of the seafood market. We decided to follow the Local Korean crowd. Though it was a Sunday afternoon, many locals are here to buy their seafood. We walked towards where most of them are congregated and start checking out the live seafood. There are no pricing listed on the seafood tank. So the best way is to dish out your calculator and start asking The price and punching the numbers. For those whom are new to this manner of ordering. Please note. 1. Order your fresh seafood from the stall at level 1/ basement. 2. If you want to have it cook and eat on the spot, the restaurants are on the second floor. The pricing for cooking is another additional cost. Some of it does by the weight. You may ask them to lower the cost of the dish is simple to cook. Example. We order the abalone and wanted it cook as porridge. The abalone is the cost we paid to the live seafood stall by kg. We also have to pay the Restuarant for the cooking cost - it comes out to 5000won per kg. 3. Other miscellaneous cost are the towels, small dishes and drink. There will be a runner that will bring you and your seafood to the Restuarant designated. I love my seafood steam, boiled and grilled. So I didn't make it complicated. As the runner is from China, we spoke in Mandarin and he gave the precise ways  on how our seafood are cooked. We ordered the crab, large cockles and abalones We have very enjoyable meal there as our Neighbour diner whom are Korean were sharing their sashimi with us and trying to communicate with us in his  simple English. I recommend only those who love seafood to visit this place. Just not be frustrated but do some simple calculation before you confirm your order in bulk.", September 2016
248,2.0,Tourists are bound to get extorted here,"The fish market is pretty huge, with all of the stalls selling close to the same items. It is difficult to decide who to purchase from so make sure you take your time surveying before deciding. We made the mistake of not doing that and just buying from a random ahjumma. She had promised to sell us an octopus + a slab of salmon for 24,000w but however after catching the octopus, she changed it to 29,000w. We refused but she just got angry and shoved the octopus at us then proceeded to tell us to pay and leave. While my friend and I were discussing on what to do, she rudely told us to speak in mandarin (she could speak in korean and mandarin). The both of us decided to go with it because we didn't want to create a scene. So then this other ahjumma brought us to her restaurant in the 2nd floor. All she did was to provide us some cutleries, sauces, kimchi and cut our octopus for us. We were charged 10,000w for that. Definitely the most unpleasant dining experience we had in Korea. However the salmon and octopus were really fresh so that is worth noting. If you visit, be careful!!", September 2016
249,2.0,poor seafood experience,"this fish market is consist of a sea of fish mongers who will sell you live seafood and then a runner will bring the seafood for you to restaurants nearby for further processing/cooking (which comes at additional cost e.g. soup 10k won; grill 5k won; steam 5k won etc). due to the intense competition (most fish mongers have similar products), they will try their best to pull you and get your attention as you walk down the aisle, making it a very unpleasant experience for me. I observed that price of similar seafood is different among the fish mongers and hence suspected that some will mark up the price considerably to take advantage of the tourists. haggle is compulsory (which only makes the experience worse for me)the seafood restaurant we were brought into was sub-par. we had flounder fish (soup + sashimi), abalone (grilled + sashimi) and grilled scallop. apart from the fish soup (which were also average), the rest were prepared crudely (e.g. can find bone in the sashimi) and taste bland.considering the double pricing system and potential marking up of this place, i wouldn't consider the seafood cheap also.perhaps a ""must-visit"" for first-time tourist for its unique experience but i did not enjoy mine", September 2016

251,4.0,'Indoor ocean' for fresh seafood,"Took the subway line to Noryangjin Fish Market, very easy to located this place if you are taking the public Seoul Subway. Walking in to this indoor fish market like walking in to a 'indoor ocean', many types of fresh seafood from alantic ocean to pacific ocean water. Of course we are not able to communicate well with the vendor there, but if you do speak Mandarin, they are few vendor do speak Mandarin and it will help with your seafood bargaing process. Like usual, you can pick the seafood and get it weight for the price, if you are happy just pay it, or you love the bargain.. enjoy it. Then, if you want to have your seafood there, the vendor will help you to carry it up to the selected restaurant. The restuarant will choose the best way to make the seafood as taste as original from sashimi way to steamed or cook it according to your choice. You have to pay for it, not really expensive as most of the cooking is just simple steamed. You can also buy the seafood home and cook it at home.Most tourist misunderstood the whole buying and eating in the restaurant procedure.Step 1: You pick, weight and agree the price then you pay (no cooking charge incl)Step 2: If you want to seafood to me cook by the restaurant, the vendor will help you to bring it to the restaurant or you bring it homeStep 3: You want the restaurant to cook it, of course you have to pay for it. You can ask for the price first if you worry if is a scam, but I personally find it ok. Enjoy your fresh seafood !", April 2016

As a tourist, chances are, you aren't going to buy seafood to take home or cook yourself.  There are several restaurants that you can buy seafood at the market and they will cook it for you.  The only problem is choosing the right restaurant.  Be careful of the different charges for cooking.  Most the restaurants charge the same.  The hard part is figuring out which one will cook it best.  We chose wrong, but I'm sure there are some good restaurants upstairs in the market.  I think there were about 20 to choose from.  For me it was just fun to see the market.", August 2016
254,5.0,Fresh seafood and new building compare to few years ago,"You can enjoy to buy the seafood and cook at the 2nd floor of local restaurant. Not cheap to cook compare with the seafood because it is simple cook or fresh to eat. If you compare BBQ beef or pork, it is cheaper and worth to eat, King Crab, Octopus, sea ‚Äã‚Äãurchin...etc Very delicious", August 2016
255,3.0,"Lots of fresh seafood, King crab is the star","Went to Noryangjin Fish market for lunch. My first impression was there are a lot of stalls selling the same stuff and can get pushy at times. Had a problem deciding which to go for to choose the seafood to eat. Anyway after randomly selecting a seller she got what we wanted, a king crab, scallops and prawns for the 2 of us. After weighing price was 68000 krw. Brought us up a floor to the restaurant to cook and after we agreed in the style of cooking we waited patiently for the food. Very simple style, steamed and bbq, plus a fried rice at the end with what's left of the king crab. Damage was another 48000 which we though was high given the little work and ingredients added. Ok, the crab was very good, fresh and sweet so at the end of the day, it was worth it. Would I go again...Yes for the king crab.", August 2016
256,3.0,Excellent variety but beware!,"Live King crabs, lobsters, uni and more. Perfect for buying to cook it yourself but do not eat it there! They will charge various fees for cooking/seating and even after you agreed on a price, they will ask for extra fees. Also they simply don't know how to cook the foods; tough overcooked meat. We went 2 times to different restaurants and got cheated both times - even the lobster tail mysteriously disappeared and they insisted all the meat was served already, to top it off an extra $30 for.. boiling it.", August 2016
257,3.0,"New venue, cheap seafood","Perhaps it was the time we went weekday just before lunch but there was not as many stalls opened. This was a new building and very clean for a wet market, all the restaurant are upstairs and usually the stalls you buy from will take you to their affiliated one. Food wasn't so great for young children since they can't take sashimi and spicy food. But the fresh sea urchin tasted so heavenly compared to the ones in Singapore.", June 2016
258,4.0,visit the old and the new,It‚Äôs a 5 minute walk from the metro We toured the old and the newThe new is definitely more cleanEvery stall holder wants you sell you something. Its Ok Its just like every other market in Asia.My wife wanted something special it was our anniversary so we chose king crab. It was around 2 kilos and cost won 50k with won 20k for cookingWe followed a runner upstairs to a small very clean restaurant area where the crab was cooked beautifully. I don‚Äôt complain about the price. I just let you know about my great seafood experienceI will recommend to all my friends to visit this market for the experience, July 2016
259,2.0,Smelly fish market ,Old and dirty fish market. Was in 10 minutes ready. Hard sell market place owners. Not particularly worth the visit. The signs to the market was odd. You have to take the higher bridge to get there. During the afternoon most of the stalls were closed., July 2016
260,3.0,Double the price if you are not speaking korean,"I bought some seafood and ask them to cook for me.  I was in the older building. The seafood are very fresh but the way they prepare is not perfect. They over cooked my abalone and scallop.  However, it still a very good experience. Tonight I walk into one of the local supermarket, I can get the same  for half the price.  I think that why they do not displace the price. I suggest you should bring a Korean friend with you to get better deal. I spent 30k won for the food, 18k for the preparation.", July 2016
261,3.0,the best place to try Sannakji,"We buy 2 octopus for 10K won, 1 king crab for 20K won and 1 big plate salmon sahimi for 20K won. Thats worthed!Nice fish market.", July 2016
262,3.0,A bit intimidating,"It's a cool experience to walk around and choose fresh seafood, but all the sellers are quite aggressive and come up very close to try and get you to buy their stock. to the point where we were too scared to stop and actually look at anything closely because they were so pushy. There are two parts, one in the older more traditional fish market type and the other side is newer and looks slightly cleaner. I went with a local friend, and even she wasn't so happy with the experience. I don't know what I would have done without a local, but somehow we managed to order something and ate at the restaurant side, which is a bit of a walk away.", June 2016
263,2.0,A bad experience ,"Finding this place was hard.The place is dirty, staff not friendly .If you kana  stop by n watch ,they staff that speak Chinese will persuade you to buy their seafood and say lots of things just to hook you .They can cook the seafood that you picked for you ,let you sit in a comfortable .Price of seafood you pay first.Cook different pay separately Per person charges In the end pay a lot ...eat nothing .Not worth it .", June 2016
264,4.0,Just a good experience ,"Was there in early June 16 and they're expanding to a large more modern building next door but activity at the original is still very much there.  Group of three and wandered for a while and settled on the live octopus with large sashimi platter from a vendor.  The octopus was wrapped in a bag with sea water and we were escorted to a small restaurant where the octopus was chopped up and the huge sashimi platter was delivered.  Not cheap but not really expensive.  From our picked vendor had choices of 30-40-50,000 won sashimi platters and we took the most expensive because we were givin a bonus plate with more fish and sea creatures.  All said and done about 60,000 won (~$50 USD) for an incredible amount of fresh fish.  Finished it all, luckily my korean friend is a competitive eater :)", June 2016
265,3.0,Not a huge market but still worth it,Am sitting at one of their restaurants upstairs and eating the fresh fish I just purchased downstairs. does not get much better as an experience for a foodie.the market is easily accessed by subway and a short walk from the station.it's definitely not as impressive as Tsukiji or Sydney fish markets.The sashimi was fantastic and waiting for my lobster to be cooked.good use of my free afternoon between meetings., June 2016
266,4.0,Great king crab ,"This place is very cool and definitely a must-see in Seoul. We went on a Tuesday for lunch and it was almost empty. First, figure out what you want - we wanted king crab. Walk around and get prices from a few different vendors and figure out who has the lowest. Once we had a vendor picked out, we negotiated and got out crab for about $50 bucks. Then you go upstairs and find a restaurant and they will steam it for you. We also negotiated up there - just ask a few places for prices and see who is the cheapest. Overall, fun experience and the King crab was amazing!", June 2016
267,3.0,Save your money on a proper restaurant,"There is a new building new to the market, some of the staffs said they are about to move-in but still under some touch-up. We have been searching in the old market for 30mins, bargain is only for one lost cost fish but not like big crab and lobster. You may be able to spend the same money if you are dinning in a proper restaurant or even hotel.", April 2016
268,4.0,Repeat visit,"This is the second time we are at Noryangjin Fish Market. We had been visiting the older one and decided to try the new block. The seafood is still good and my son loves the abalone. Tried the sea urchin this time, 2 for 10000 won. They were fresh and sweet. The seafood sellers usually don't speak other language but there are runners who do speak mandarin and English to support them as well as leading the customers to the restaurants to cook the seafood purchase. The preparation rates are stated for the different ways in the restaurant or can always check.", June 2016
269,3.0,Huge Fish Markets,"it was quite confusing as this was our first time, you basically choose your seafood someone helped us choose and translate and lead us to upstairs to a restaurant and they cook it but you have to pay a fee for it.", June 2016
270,3.0,"A must, only if you love seafood","The market is now in its third location over the years -- this latest iteration is new, spacious, sanitary, and (until Noryangjin Station finishes its renovations) a bit hard-to-find.    Some sidewalk stickers guided us the roundabout route.  The old decrepit buildings are apparent nearby.  The new version is a bit sanitized--not much worry about getting dirty at all.  When we went, Thursday lunchtime, it seemed rather empty.  But the variety and freshness of seafood is apparent, really a good place for a seafood lover.  Lots of restaurants upstairs will cook your fish to taste; in a slow period (as with us), they may even take pity on a clueless foreigner and walk down with you to the stalls and help you order your king crab and octopus and anything else.  The crab was expensive but stunning (YOLO).  The raw octopus is indeed weird but palatable--literally sticks to the roof of your mouth!   Note: if anybody in the group does not like seafood or the sight of fish being gutted, go somewhere else that day.  Note also that there's not much English spoken, but they are very friendly and helpful.  I wish the government would spend some effort on tourism support there.", June 2016
271,4.0,Affordable seafood,"Went with my family of 6, and we had/ price in k'KRW: 1 king crab weighing 2kg+ (Russian or Alaskan I do not know)/ 70k, 4 abalones/ 10k, 1 halibut /60k (forgot the weight), 3 or 4 small octopuses/ 10k. Paid a restaurant a charge of 56k for preparation of food; steamed the crab, had half the halibut raw and the other half in soup, barbequed the abalones and had the octopuses raw. When we went into the market, we were followed by a chinese-speaking man who tried to ""help"" recommend us the seafood. Found him bothersome after awhile so went up to the 2nd floor to look around and to choose our own place. Plenty of restaurant runners around, don't think they are trying to rip you off, just there to earn a commission. Just ignore them if you don't like it, I did. Good prices, especially when compared to where I came from. The vendors will throw in some freebies as well (I got some salmon sashimi when I bought the halibut)", May 2016
272,4.0,Amazing experience,"Visited this market to get some good and cheap seafood. The variety is astonishing - all kinds of clams, sea urchins, fish, crabs, shellfish, etc. The sea urchin was a disappointment as it wasn't as fresh or tasty as what we had in Taipei or Tokyo, but the Alaskan king crab was amazing - just simply steamed and the sweetness in the flesh was to die for.", June 2016
273,5.0,Fish market,Amazing place where you can find all sort of fish and everything the sea can offer. If you want you can taste the fish for very little money. A must, May 2016
274,5.0,Best King crab and priceless experience!,"The 4 of us visited Noryangjin market via subway. We are seafood lovers.   Signage in subway pointed us to the stairs and walkway bridge to the market.  Reviews on trip advisor helped us to know the going rate for the King crab.  Vendors offered us 60,000 to 35,000 won per kilo (2.2 lbs) for king crab.  We went to 6 vendors before heading back to stall #84 which was the 35,000 won price and the nicest lady.  Our crab was 2.4 kilos at 80,000 won.  We also bought large abalone at 2 for 10,000 won.  We were taken to a restaurant outside the market after finding that all the upstairs restaurants were closed.  We went on a Sunday morning.  Best King crab all Of us have eaten, as it was fresh and in season!  So sweet and easily shelled!  We paid 28,000 won for the restaurant to cook the food and with side dishes.  Restaurant was clean, and efficient.  Our meal was less than 30$ U.S. Per person.  Fabulous meal and one of a kind experience was totally worth it...Priceless!  Will surely recommend this experience to seafood lovers!", May 2016
275,3.0,Ripped off,"We actually got our seafood from the first few stores and got brought to a small stall which prepares for us. The preparation cost USD80 and it wasn't any cheaper. If you really want to try, do walk further down much much more as my friend didn't have to pay any preparation cost at all the previous time.", May 2016
276,4.0,Fresh Breakfast/ Brunch,"Interesting place though less rowdy than Tokyo's Tsukiji Fish Market. We chose a lobster, crab and sea urchin for only 54,000w. The stall vendor whisked us away to a nearby restaurant that helped us prepare the freshest seafood ever!", May 2016
277,5.0,Must see,"It's a cool place to walk through. Hard to purchase without translator, we got lobster and crab and had them cooked upstairs.", May 2016
278,5.0,amazing!,"This is a huge market with many stands selling fresh and mostly alive fish of any kinds, crabs, shrimps, shells and more.You can buy your fish, ask them to make a sashimi, and bring it to one of the many restaurants that are in the upper floor, where it will be cooked and served. Fish is not cheap, however freshness and variety justify the cost.", May 2016
279,2.0,Not worth the trip if you don't speak Korean or Mandarin,"It's a big market where a lot of vendors are selling quite a few but limited types of seafood. However, if you have been to other fish markets around the world or any big wet market, you will be disappointed with this market.1) it's really hard to find it from the train station, and there's nothing else to visit near the fish market;2) it's too old and dirty to be a tourist destination;3) the worst part is the communication: if you don't speak Korean, you even cannot ask/confirm the name of the seafood, negotiate the price or ask around to know the fair price. The aunties there speak zero English and are not very good at using body language or other tools to communicate. I got my seafood from a Mandarin-speaking auntie. I knew I got ripped-off, but there are not many aunties who can speak Mandarin, so I didn't have a choice.4) the octopus sashimi wasn't good or special either. I still prefer the Japanese wasabi octopus.5) when we brought the seafood to cook in a restaurant, we faced the communication issue again. We couldn't even describe how we wanted the seafood to be cooked. They didn't provide menu/pictures either.", May 2016
280,4.0,Overwhelming. Find a local to help you,"An amazing collection of seafood stalls under one roof. Fresh fish and shellfish as well as iced. The procedure is this:1) bring friends if you are eating at the market2) find a local person to help you. Most Koreans will be more than happy to assist you3) decide on fresh or iced. Iced fish is great for soup or barbecue and much cheaper than fresh. 4) order about 1kg per person for shellfish for soup. Remember, your eyes are bigger than your stomach. 5) negotiate and make the purchase. Take the fish to the second floor of the new building next door. The table fees are about 3000 and the cooking charge about 10000-20000 depending on how much fish and whether it's soup of just steaming.", April 2016
281,4.0,Hard to eat by yourself ,"I'm glad I went to see this fish market. Unfortunately, I speak little to no Korean so I really couldn't communicate with vendors. And the ones I did communicate with were very nice. I would have loved to have purchased and eaten the fish but it was too much for one person to consume. Best to go in a group to enjoy fresh fish. I took line 9 exit 7.", April 2016
282,3.0,Visit when you have the time ,"Went there for the first time , heard good reviews from friends . There's many stores selling seafood. To Ensure your seafood is fresh , do only order the live seafood and those seasonal seafood which the prices are cheaper .Do not order those frozen prawns , clams , as these aren't fresh at all , and we didn't finish those seafood , very disappointing . Do bargain hard too , and ask many stores for prices quotation first before deciding . For the cooking , we had to pay 3000 won for the table service . On top of this , we order fish , abalone , prawn , all these individually dishes are charged separately . There's more charges depending on the type of seafood . The crab is in season now , do order the crab . Is this a must visit ? Compared to the Tokyo fish market , I still prefer the Tokyo fish market which is more authentic. This market is filled with many Chinese stalls and prices quoted for some stalls are extortion.", April 2016
283,4.0,"Wow-Fish, and lots of them.","An interesting place. In the process of moving into a new building that is a little more clean and hygienic looking, but take time to walk through the old market. A little Squeamish for those not used to, or willing to accept that this is about providing food and not a home fish tank for gold fish!Some fish were upside down and not swimming any more, but the overall feeling is that things are fresh as they are alive. Great topic for discussion with children about the food chain, and the spider crabs trying to escape.One of those places where you come away not really knowing how to feel, but also gives some insights into how people live and work in this environment and the surrounding street stalls of vegetables and more fish, but dried this time. A good hour spent.", April 2016
284,3.0,Just a fish market,"If you want to see how fish are auctioned off, come here early in the morning, about 5:30-6am. Other times, you can buy some seafood and someone will offer to go cook it for you (at a price) and you'll be able to eat at a restaurant close by. If you want fresh seafood, this is the place to have a large variety. It's cool to check it out, but other markets in Seoul offer the same experience. Unless you're buying a whole fish i'd suggest you look elsewhere. It's nice to walk through the market though.", April 2016
285,3.0,Interesting place but many restaurants are closed.,"This is my second time going to the place. But sadly, the place is not as memorable as it was before. Main reason : many restaurants situated close to the market are not in operation. I heard it was due to any ongoing protest. So, we had not much choice for eating place. We ended up eating a a makeshift hawker place. The seafood is fresh of course (given that we selected them from the adjacent seafood market) But the food was hastily prepared and not as delicious as I remembered. :-(For those who have not been there before, be prepared to walk. The place is HUGE! the size of many football fields. Not for the faint hearted.", April 2016
286,4.0,Huge and amazing with tons of seafood,Quite pricey for some items but overall worth it.  Great place to try some Korean delicacies.  Moving baby octopus and penis fish or worms.  You choose what you want to call it.  Wet area so leave your nice shoes at the hotel.  From Myeongdong to the market costs less than $10 usd.   Much less of a hassle vs going through the subway., April 2016
287,4.0,Brand new building (Same old seafood?),"There are two parts to the market: The old building which is full of back-to-back stores of swimming fish, shrimp on ice, and all sorts of sea oddities that are edible; and the new building which has some stores sectioned off by units and escalators up to a second floor. Turns out that the new building is so new that the restaurants on the second floor were still being built when I got there! There are *some* open ones at 10:30am but the rest were either in construction or were prepping. Just a rough few tips: Technically Korean raw fish is called 'hueh' or 'hwe', but the shopkeepers are calling it 'sashimi' so we get it. Try the weird things if you dare, but at least go for the fish. Bargaining is okay, but good luck as these store keepers are hardy.", April 2016
288,4.0,Super fresh seafood!,"Very interesting place.  We chose a swimming halibut, some top shells, scallops and sea urchin.  The sea urchin was nothing much to shout about.  The halibut was a beauty and we had it grilled, as sashimi and the bones and head were made into a spicy soup.  Absolutely delicious.", April 2016
289,4.0,"Pick the LOBSTER YA WANNA eat, get it  perfectly steamed -Juicy, lots of meat & so sweet","We bought a whole lobster & snow crab in the concrete building of the Noryanjin fish market, even though there are 3 buildings that make up the market. We found the concrete building setting the newest and cleanest of the 3. We found a vendor selling lobster & crab, pointed to each type & asked how much. They charged 120,000. Korean won which is $101. BEFORE we made our seafood purchase, we asked where we could get it cooked for our lunch. They walked us over to another building closeby with people seated inside at low tables. They all had rice, Kim Chee & were eating seafood. Apparently after purchasing your seafood, you take it there & they steam it & bring it to your table. So we bought our seafood which turned out to be a kilo or 2.2# EACH of lobster & crab!! You pay the restaurant after you eat, for cooking your seafood, rice, water & Kim chee.MMMMMM It arrived steaming hot, simply placed in a huge aluminum pan cooked to bright orange perfection. They gave us 2 pairs of scissors, rice bowls, water & Kim chee. We LOVED it...so much fun & good eats........the lobster was the best...SOOOO  MUCH MEAT...not just a small tail or teeny claws, HANDFULS of lobster! We left wth full tummies & intentions to return on our next trip!", March 2016
290,4.0,New experience to meet locals and eat their food,"Noryangin is one of the Korea's largest seafood market.We can buy various fresh seafood in the first floor. We can ask the seller to slice the fish for eating as a sashimi.At that time, we only bought the fish and went to the restaurant on the 2nd floor. We requested the restaurant to make fish stew for us and we need to pay 19,000 won for 3 person. It's quite priceyüòì, but it's tasted good", February 2016
291,3.0,Better if you know Korean,"Was an ok experience, but would not come back again. Would have been better if we knew someone Korean to show us around and help haggle lol. Kind of knew we were being overpriced since we were tourists. Being Vietnamese, we were automatically thought of as Chinese tourists, and by the reactions of the people around us, I guess we were given a different (poorer) service at the restaurant after buying our fish.", April 2016

293,3.0,Interesting!  ,"We first walked into the newer looking building.... But it's the warehouse building that you want to go to.  There is a ton of seafood in there but after walking several aisles, they will all start looking the same...  We ended up buying a snow crab.  It cost us $45,000 won.  I think we got ""touristed""... The fish sellers speak a little English and some mandarin.  Here's the thing... The price per kilogram is not listed for the crabs so I feel like it's whatever they say it is particularly since we don't speak or read Korean!  This would be an excellent place to come with a Korean speaking person... Anyways, we took our crab to a restaurant on the first floor where part of the dining area is in an alley... It's a bit dirty.. Okay... A lot dirty ... We asked that our crab be steamed... The crab was sweet but way over cooked... They charged us a $5,000 won service fee... This is quite an experience... But never again unless I'm there with a Korean speaking person.  I think I could have done a much better job steaming the crab!", March 2016

297,3.0,Beware what you buy .,A friend recommended we visit. You can buy some fresh seafood and they can bring you to a restaurant in which they will prepare the seafood for your consumption.
