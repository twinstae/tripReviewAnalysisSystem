0,5.0,Stunning vista from a hidden gem,"An easy, 30-minute hike up this mountain -- a hill really -- brings you to a simple park with a colorful pavilion from where you can enjoy a magnificant view of the Han River and the southern side of Seoul. It's worth taking a trek up the hill during both a clear day and night,", September 2018
1,4.0,Wonderful rocky mountain in the middle of Seoul,"This is a mountain in Seongdonggu. Even if this is a low mountain, it has a great view facing Hangang River and southern Seoul.- Location is a bit of walk from Eungbong Metro Station. The mountain is not high. Very short climbing. There's a pavilion on top as an observatory.- Rare rocky mountain. It's also nice to see from the ground.- Popular for the nightscape.- People also do rock climbing here.", September 2018
2,4.0,Found out about it as it is a Kdrama location,Visited during the day and it was not too challenging a climb from the subway station. Nice views of the river and bridges though during the day the not very scenic industrial parts are evident too. There is a nice pavilion at the top and quite a few people out for morning exercise!, June 2018
3,5.0,A place to zone out. â™¡,"It's a quick walk to the top (around 30 minutes). Train station is just around the corner.  I stopped by one of the French-Asian cafe for sugar and an iced americano. Because they don't have anything up the little mountain. So, bring water with you.You would be able to see the Hangang river, bridges, and the Seoul skyline from the top. It's a colorful landscape at night. At one point, I had to set my tripod beside three other tripods because this place is frequented by photographers. Stop by an hour before sunset to see it transition from light to dark.", October 2016
4,5.0,Gorgeous night view,"We were so lucky our Seoul guide took us here.  He called it a secret spot.  We didn't know where we were heading to as we walked up the hill in the dark.  Then there it was through the trees, the view of the city with lights emerged.  On top of the hill there is a pavilion with a deck and exercise equipments.   We can see Han river and Seoul Forest.  It was definitely the highlight of the trip.", July 2016

6,4.0,Great for a short stroll,This is a great place for a walk or bike in central Seoul. It's similar to Namsan but less touristy and with better views. Especially good in spring when the flowers are blooming!, March 2016
