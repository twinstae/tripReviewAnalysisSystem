0,4.0,A cool place to explore the Blue House,"It's a special place for you to know about korea politic, to experience some interesting VR games, to get a view of some korea hot and nice attractions through its videos. There are some cool spots for you to take photo like president's car with body guards surrounds you. I also admire some old ancient things at the exhibition room on the 2nd floor.

1,5.0,Quick look of Korea's political history,"Itâ€™s a very interesting place to see how Korea built diplomatic relationship with other countries. You can also see the gifts that Korean presidents and other countries exchange with each other. In front of the memorial hall you take a scenery picture with the mountain, and couple of minutes from there you can take a look of the front part of Blue House.", April 2019
