0,5.0,Went specifically because I watched on Netflix. Found the noodles and dumpling stall and the crab stall. Both amazing. Really good food from wonderful hardworking people.
1,5.0,"There are various markets around town, and you should visit several to see the differences. This one has lots of authentic food stalls and fabric stores selling hanbok fabrics. You can purchase clothing and coats here (be sure to bargain), as well as quilted slippers, bags, and vests. Worthwhile to see!"
2,4.0,"An impressive market and well worth visiting if you want to get the feel of a real Korean market, or are looking for souvenirs of any description."
3,5.0,"We love visiting the market - with all of the stores, food vendors, and people.  One can easily get lost in the market (my companion who had been there several times just got lost after using the rest room), so best to have a plan if you get separated.  If you are looking for kitchenware, hanbok, clothing, souvenirs, bedding, or just some great food, this is your place to experience some great Korean culture.  We went upstairs into the Gwangjang hanbok market and ordered custom made clothing.  We highly recommend this place.  The smells of some of the foods might be challenging to foreigners.  Just a head's up."
4,5.0,come here in the evenings and eat at the food stalls. It is an experience with almost no tourists and local food and next to no english speakers. I enjoyed it.
5,5.0,"Get everything from hanboks to the most authentic Korean street foods such as jokbal, soondae and bindaeddeok.  it's a wonderful throw back to the marketplace lifestyle that's been largely gentrified now in Seoul."
6,4.0,"One of my friend want to try the ""Squiggling octopus"" he found on a documentary (and lots of youtube clip), so we looked for someplace local.We were here around 20am and the place is packed with people. Most food stalls has English menu, so language is not a problem. The food looks the same across various stalls, but that's not a problem for us since the is our first time anyway."
7,5.0,"Visit this market is a must if you will travel to Seoul. Many things to see, buy, eat, you will find that Korean people is kind."
8,5.0,This is one of my favorite place to go every year when I visit to Korea. It is like time square in New York but all shopping center. There has many things to eat and buy. Specially night time is perfect time to visit. Highly recommend to stop by.
9,5.0,This market is in the middle of the oldest part of Seoul. There are many indoor and outdoor restaurants. The pancakes are the specialty. You can also browse the flea market type stalls selling anything from food to clothing.
10,4.0,This was more like the kind of market I was expecting to see.There was lots of variety from the old to the new. we finished our walk around 5.30 and joined the locals at one of the food stalls to eat fried chicken and drink beerIt was one the most memorable and best experiences of the visit
11,5.0,Go in the evening. Buzzy. No one speaks any English but everyone is super friendly. Ease yourself in with a mung bean pancake then stroll around and try something more adventurous. A lot of weird and wonderful things to eat here.
12,5.0,"Busy, busy, busy! Great atmosphere, hustle and bustle, people everywhere and of all ages and selling everything; very safe, great street food and loads of bars and restaurants all around."
13,5.0,This place is always busy. There's lots of local food to share with others. Lots of cute cultural gifts and hanboks. I really wish I bought a hanbok here (because it's custom made and ready to buy) but I didn't have enough time.Recommend to go here to try local snacks with friends.
14,3.0,"Its a bustling market with plenty of food stalls selling almost the same stuff - pancake pan fried. I like the late afternoons when there are very friendly elderly locals drinking and eating and if you dare and care, you could join in, buy a bottle of soju, order some food and sit on the communal long bench."
15,5.0,"This place is exactly what I expected of a Korean market! It is filled with stores and stalls selling all kinds of things. You can buy chopsticks- ranging from cheap to beautifully carved and expensive, raw fish, fabric, souvenirs, etc. There are a ton of food stalls and stands selling some really delicious looking food. I had some bimbimbap made right in front of me. A word of caution though- very few people here speak English. If you have a food restriction (like you're a vegetarian) have the concierge write it out in Korean for you. Also you can barter for the things you want to buy. The woman I was with just typed the number she wanted to pay on the merchant's calculator."
16,3.0,"It is nice to drop by this place if you have some extra time to spare. A morning visit to this place allows you to see the local way of life. The place is segregated according to different streets selling the same stuff. Thus, one sector will have a whole row of shops selling traditional costume, one on food, one on souvenir and etc. It is a good experience to sit at one of the food store to have the stomach filled as well. This market is about one stop away from Dongdaemun and it's easily accessible."
17,5.0,"Yes, this is the market place crowded with locals and tourists. If you're afraid of language bearer, not to worry, most of the stalls do have helpers that speak Mandarin or simple English. You may not want to miss the various hot-pot offering in the tiny restaurants too.I prefer to go there near noon when the shops there are opened and you will get a lot of stuff there at good price. The kimchi stores there also offer air-tight packing for your shipment too."
18,4.0,Good place to experience the local delicacies and shopping for Korean traditional product. A little bit crowded place with Korean people. Language could be a problem as no clear sign or english speaking hawker. Interesting place to visit to see the daily life of Korean people.
19,5.0,"Excellent, inexpensive street food that goes very well with beer!   Could be improved with more variety."
