14,4.0,"This attraction greets you straight out of the train station, and the futuristic building is the first thing you see upon exiting. If you love structures and architecture, you'll very much enjoy taking in the sights here. We visited this place at night since that's the best time to appreciate the lights that make the attractions even more striking. The rooftop garden is also worth a visit, if you have the time, and the walk leading up to it is quite romantic."
