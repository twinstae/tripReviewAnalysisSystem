1,4.0,"It is a good place to hang out with friends in Seoul Korea. I have visited this place many times to eat, shopping, drink coffee, buy books, and window shopping too. I took subway line 1 to go there and very easy to get there from station by walk. Especially I like that there are many small shops around to get there and the prices of products are cheap too. The place feel different with any other department stores, feel like more comfortable and convenient place than other shopping places."

3,1.0,If you're staying in the heart of the city in Seoul don't go to this mall go to the CoEx Mall. This mall had a higher rating and it took 40 minutes to get here by taxi ðŸ˜¢ it was definitely overrated and I couldn't believe I had almost leave the city to get here.
4,3.0,"If you're familiar with malls, you'll be familiar with Times Square Mall. It's a big mall with a lot of local Korean and Western brands. When I went, there were even pop-up stores on the first floor. It's nice to check out but if you're looking for local goods, check out other places like Insadong or Bokchon."
