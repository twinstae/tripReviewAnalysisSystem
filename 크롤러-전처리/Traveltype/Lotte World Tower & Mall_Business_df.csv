0,3.0,Very large modern mall that is compromised by the towers above it. Has all the big brands but has a bit of an odd layout
1,5.0,"A stunning building, really worth visiting it! The 5th highest building in the world till now! Keep in mind that great view will be experienced only during good visibility!"
2,5.0,"This mall is near to Lotte Hotel , this mall is bit expensive and if you look around properly you can find cheaper items as well , having many branded shops , good place for the shopaholics."
3,4.0,"Visited when I did a trip around Korea, there is many things to see in Korea and this was worth a visit"
4,5.0,"beeing in Seoul, you should try to catch a view from top. Would recommend, to go there for sunset. This is something, you would miss..."
5,5.0,You MUST checkout this giant Tower and see the observatory deck and the seoul city from the top there it ismAWESOME
6,4.0,"Very typical shopping mall with all international brands as well as many small stores. Big surprise: they even had a Swiss Music Box store ""Reuge"".... felt like home.."
7,4.0,I think this mall  can be a must to visit if you will stay in Seoul. huge mall with a lot of shops and restaurants. also don't miss to visit the tower. the view and the experience to see Seoul from the top is something you would try.
8,5.0,"Lotte is a conglomerate that basically does everything. So why not a shopping mall? Enormous shopping mall with from aquarium to restaurants. If you have only one day to go shopping, visit here. They have a supermarket too."
9,5.0,the stunning elevator ride to the top was superb. We were lucky it was a clear day and needless to say the views were stunning! The outdoor viewing was another plus - the glass floors were great! Well worth the visit.
10,5.0,"well the mall was excellent but the prize were crazy for me lol. to enter lotte tower you need to enter inside mall, believe me you would have great times at this lotte tower"
11,4.0,"The Lotte World Tower and Mall is worth a detour. Not because of the mall, very nice but also very much like any high end mall. No; go up the tower. It's not cheap, but definately an experience. They e.g. have a glass floor were you have a somewhat unnerving view straigth down. But also a truly spectacular view over Seoul."
12,5.0,To go to the top of the Lotte World Tower is an unique experience. From the lift till the view is fear the price that cost.
13,4.0,"One gets a wonderful view of the whole Seoul from the top of this tower; it is a worthwhile experience, although very expensive. After paying the entrance fee, the visitors are taken through a long path before reaching the elevator to the top of the tower and have to waste their time while the staff takes compulsory photos of them; if one wants a copy of any photo, one has to pay extra money."
14,5.0,Idea is great and the whole entrance procedure like entering space shuttle. You will experience the extreme feelings to enter the glass floor ;) There is also the balcony which is great to visit. View on Seoul is amazing. It worth to be in Lotte Tower.
15,3.0,"A Great once and done park. Always crowded. It is a great attraction that you want to check off your Seoul list, but if you miss it, you will live."
16,5.0,"This was an experience. The glass floor view is really exciting and made for some great picture taking. The Elevator ride was fast, but could not even feel it. There is plenty of space to walk around and see the views of the city."
17,5.0,"Great building, very tall and the panoramic level is the highest in the word. In september, it wasn’t very busy and the climbing process went pretty fast. It is worth visiting. I have been in panoramic buildings, but this is the far most impressive."
18,3.0,"Normal if you visit at the day time.Around the tower have shopping mall, duty free and supermarket"
19,5.0,"You can only buy the replica of Seoul tower from the tower, the best thing is to have coffee on the 123rd floor."
20,5.0,"The tower was not open when we were there but it looks nice.  Lots of shopping, with almost every store available.  Prices were higher than in the US, so I would know your pricing before shopping."
21,3.0,"Big shopping centre but with the added attraction of Lotte Tower and and acquarium. Once you've seen one shopping centre, you've seen them all"
22,5.0,Really enjoyed a visit to the top decks of this tower. Went up at night and the view is definitely spectacular! One floor has a corner with glass floor panels where one can look down and see the ground a couple hundred meters below... A great place to take pictures.The mall has a luxurious feeling and there are plenty of shops from well known brands and restaurants to buy whatever one desires.
23,5.0,"Don't let the tower's price tag deter you. There are several spots to relax on the 6+ floors (I know, right?) of viewing pleasure up at the top of the LOTR looking tower that apparently blocks Korean jets from blowing DPRK nukes out of the sky. Anyways, I'd recommend coming up before sunset and staying for the city lighting up. It's lovely and the glass floor is a mind-altering experience. The wifi is free and strong so you can make a nice snap or insta story whilst on top of the world."
24,5.0,I liked this new tower very much. It is fifth tallest in the world. There are several levels for viewing and with snack shops with a restaurant on the very top level. It is over the Lotte mall which is fabulous. Nice souvenir items inclduing photos. Did not experience a long line in the winter. No outdoor viewing permitted in January.
25,5.0,It's expensive ($25) to ride up to the top for city views but still worth seeing all of Seoul from its observation decks. You can buy a photo of yourself taken as you enter with various backdrops.
26,5.0,...but the view is always depending on the weather.We have been there and took the VIP Tour. Really great guided tour with interesting information. The ride with the (at least they said) fastest elevator in the world is quite short but impressive how fast you are on upper level. From there you have to enjoy the amazing view. We did with a beer :-)
27,5.0,Already the architechture of this tower is breathtaking. Looking at the city of the deck on a hight of 500m is unforgettable.pricing of KRW24000 is okay.
28,5.0,"If the elevator ride wasn't impressive enough, the views will thrill you even more.  Unfortunately, the outdoor terrace portion wasn't open when I was there, but the see-thru floors were vertigo inducing on their own."
29,5.0,"Seuol largest shopping centre full of every brand you ever heard of and endless restaurants. Great travel links, and a pleasant park and landscaping outside to relax"
30,5.0,"Impressive observation deck with beautiful views from the tallest building in Seoul. The elevator ride is fully immersive and very impressive with LED screens on all walls. The observation deck offers views facing multiple directions and also features a glass floor for those looking for a little thrill. There is a small café and a candy stand on the observation deck floors. The building itself also houses multiple malls meeting a range of price points, and a large food court as well as offices."
31,3.0,"If you visit Seoul and you have some Korean wons left you must visit this place; Lotte is the biggest shopping mall in the city ( with also some duty free shops at Incheon airport )Beware not to get lost, this mall is huge and easy to find on one of the most known avenues in the city."
32,4.0,"Opening in 2017 the Lotte World Tower is one of the world's tallest buildings, I only made it to the 76th floor for a private dinner (with another 50 floors or so to go to the summit), but even from there the panoramic views of Seoul are impressive. I would definitely come back to go to the top when I have more time !"
33,5.0,"To be clear, the mall itself is not crowded, but the restaurants are overwhelmed with people. I was there around 7pm for dinner. There're so many exciting restaurants but they're all full. Queues looked like they're 40+ minutes. So I ended up with fried chicken and french fries, which I wasn't impressed.I'd still give 5 stars and recommend everyone for a visit, but avoid peak hour if you want to dine here."
34,3.0,"This is a very beautiful modern building. There is a shopping complex under the tower, close to Lotte World.  However the observation tower fees is just ridiculously expensive for the 5th tallest building in the world.  I would save the money to visit the Burj.  They have even a more expensive express ticket (approx 50 USD) which is crazy, but I guess they have done their statistics on this.  It is however the tallest building in Korea and indeed you can see it from anywhere especially when coming into Seoul by land transportation."
