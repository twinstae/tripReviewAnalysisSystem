0,1.0,"Came here on a whim at 10:30 and expected this place to be bustling. There were about 6 people milling about. Selection of available seafood was unimpressive, I saw nothing I hadn't already seen in your run of the mill chinatown in the states. I made a small purchase from one reasonable seller, 15000 for 5 oysters and some small shrimp..I wanted to get some more variety so browsed around. Found some other stalls and ended up getting ripped off, which I suppose is my fault for not being aware of standard market prices-- I was charged more than double the going rate for piece of salmon and shrimp. The seller called some chinese guy over to ""translate"" (Im bilingual) but really so they could work together to gouge me.(to save yourself this grief download the korean Norangyin fish market app (search the name in Korean) which continually updates with current prices.)He then brought me here: 일 번 지 노량진 수산 시장 신 건물 2 층I didn't think it was possible to ruin fresh seafood but somehow they did it! They charged me 19000 won to steam 5 oysters, grill 6 shrimp and a chunk of salmon ALL WITHOUT OILS AND SEASONING, not even salt!!. Everything tasted bland and dry and to add insult to injury all this took 40 minutes. I mean Im shocked they didnt even add any oils. I can't imagine what could have taken so long since they literally added nothing to the food.  Service was just ok.I would not recommend this tourist trap without a guide, they will price gouge you. Ive been to Korea several times and have always found the people to be warm and honest EXCEPT HERE (and the shops at Ewha)."
1,3.0,Heard from friend to give it a try. Ordered crab and 2 large prawns and cost 73000 won with cooking fee. Seafood tastes very fresh.
2,4.0,"As many of you have probably read in other reviews you buy seafood from one of the vendors on the main floor. Then you're brought up to the 2nd floor where they take you to a restaurant where they cook the food for you. I bought a king crab (price is by weight) and an order of prawns which came 5 in an order. That cost me KRW 60,000 which is about $50. I thought that would be it but when I went to pay the restaurant charged ME another approximately KRW 30,000 as a service fee for cooking the food. All in with a beer cost me about USD $90 or fractional more. The food was fresh and good but I wasn't prepared to spend that much. Oh well you live and learn."
3,3.0,"... not to eat. I enjoy fish markets the world over. I go very early in the day to look around and take pics. This place is impressive, if a bit odd. It’s very close to the subway station. I didn’t bother to buy anything and have it cooked at one of the upstairs restaurants."
4,4.0,"I headed here on the Metro system early one Friday afternoon recently and more or less followed my nose out of the station, through an underpass and came out between the two buildings that make up the bulk of this extensive fish market. I first wandered over to the old building. There were still many stallholders selling their wares but around 2 o'clock in the afternoon there were few buyers. It's safe to say that you should be able to buy any type of marine life you fancy eating here. I wasn't buying and I was rarely stopped for any hard sell.Later, I walked over to the much newer building where, again there seemed to every thinkable type of marine life available for purchase.  Again there were more than enough stalls but few customers. I took the escalator up to the first floor where there was very much the same extensive selection, including loads of dry fish and stalls where you could buy sauces, pastes etc. Lining this floor were many small, rustic type restaurants where I'm sure fresh sea food is a guarantee. I headed deep into the interior of this floor and found an edo sushi restaurant which I simply couldn't resist. This is certainly the place to come if you are curious about seeing a traditional market with the complete focus on the sea and everything that swims, crawls or simply exists in it."
5,4.0,"I was there at roughly 11pm, when no business activity was going on, just the preparation for the early morning hours, so I was just strolling around. Anyway, I had a good time just looking at the quiet stands and people getting ready for a big action hours later. Could imagine that in such a large place the wholesale is a big affair."
6,4.0,"So I've got 2-3 hours left in my 12 hour Seoul layover before I have to catch the AREX back to the airport in time for my flight. What to do? Shoehorn another palace in there? Maybe Namsan tower? Nah... I'm going to the fish market because I want to try live octopus!It took a little longer than I planned to get there, and by now I'm starting to chicken out. Maybe I'll just take pictures, I start to think...But sellers are pretty aggressive... and one thing leads to another, so pretty soon I'm bargaining for octopus. But still I think it's probably not going to work out, because I don't speak any Korean. But soon, a diner who speaks English comes forward to help me out and tell me how it works. I pay the seller 2000 won for the octopus, take it, wiggling in a plastic bag full of water, to a restaurant around the corner (more like a few tables and plastic chairs with not exactly the most pristine looking kitchen), I pay the kitchen lady 3000 won and watch her chop it up and put a little sauce on it... and soon the octopus emerges -still wiggling but in pieces now -along with some Korean hot sauce and a couple side dishes. The pieces don't want to stay on my chopsticks, so she gives me a fork. It was delicious. I still wasn't too sure I did a wise thing. But then I watched another lady buy a styrofoam crate full of live octopi from the same seller. She picks one up, and lowers it into her mouth, whole! Wiggling tentacles and all. Sauce? We don't need no stinkin' sauce!So I guess it's Ok... I'm thinking I'll find out within 24 hours... or perhaps during my 12 hour flight home. A week has gone by now and I'm fine. The poor octopi... less so. Seek out new experiences.... but carry activated charcoal just in case.  Caveat: While I spent a grand total of 5 dollars on my whole experience, I've read reviews of people who've been ripped off. I think I got lucky. The Korean diner who helped me out said that it cost him 3000 won to cover his table. Granted, all I had was octopus for one. A multi-course seafood feast would probably cost more, but I can't imagine it should really cost the exorbitant prices some people are paying. Probably best to go with a local."
7,5.0,"There's 2 market at this location.the old market is still operation, but not sure when it will be total tear down for construction.the new market is just beside the old market, with air condition and fully covered.there's 2 level of the market and you can have some Restaurant helping you to prepare the seafood that you bought form the market.Nice experience to see so many different kind of fish and seafoods.with live octopus."
8,5.0,"Loving this place, you can pick your own seafood lively and proceed to the restaurant and tell them how you want it to be cook. The price is very reasonable too. Good place to have fresh seafood."
9,5.0,"I never knew so many breeds, types and approaches to fish could be such a business.  Many stalls with more fish and seafood than one can imagine.  You can select your food downstairs and then be directed upstairs to have one of the restaurants prepare the food for you.  Very interesting."
10,4.0,"pretty varied options, but pricey. The sellers are also pretty friendly. Just wish the seafood was more affordable and the restaurant options too"
11,5.0,The fish market is located partially in a modern building and partially in the old one.Use variety of fish and sea food and you can buy and take it to a market restaurant for preparation.The amount and variety of yellow fish tuna lobsters crabs rays squids and even sharks is more than you see while diving. Amazing and tasty
12,4.0,Loads of freshly caught fish and other sea-stuff for sale. Fantastic how this works and interesting to see what things from the sea Koreans eat beside fish and shellfish... If you buy something they can send if upstairs where it is prepared for you.
13,4.0,A very nice market to visit. I had never seen most of the sea creatures there b4. It smells alot but you can endure it. I think the market is worth a visit. If I lived in Seoul I would buy different fishes and now a meal. But as tourist is a shame not be able to do so Take the metro and take the exit 7 I think....look at the exitmap an follow wich exit u need to take. When you exit the metro... just go straight about 5 min. Then turn right...follow the tunnel (Lots of older women selling vegetables there) to the end and you see the noryangjin market....first you see the new building and at the right side of the building there is the old market. My favourite was the old part.
14,3.0,"First time to Noryangjin Fish Market, the market size is big with variety of fresh and dried seafood."
15,3.0,"Seafood is not my cup of tea but I happened to be there one morning, walked around and took photos, the seafood was pretty fresh."
16,5.0,"once you arrive with the metro to noryangjin stop you will have to pass trough the railway station , there is some small streets or a bridge.  be also careful there is to fish market , the traditional and 50 meters after the new market, you have to see both"
17,4.0,"It is easy to get here by train.   Short walk (200m) through an ally and you will reach this market.   You may get a lot of fresh seafood and plenty of restaurants can prepare seafood selected by you.  I suggest you cook them yourself if you stay in Seoul long enough.   Since there are many Chinese visitors, price of seafood is not much cheaper than those in local market.   Worth to pay a visit if you love seafood."
18,4.0,"A completely new (and some may say sanitised) fish market has been created covering an immense site and over several floorsThe ground floor areas concerned with the preparation, display and sale of dead and live products. There is a cornucopia of sea food on offer - very colourful very interesting and to me - many of the products unrecognisableUpper floors are devoted to offices, shops and many small independent restaurantsNot an obvious tourist attraction - but for anyone with an interest in food it is a mustThe market is within easy walking distance of Noryangjin Metro Station (Lines 1 and 9)"
19,3.0,"I bought some seafood and ask them to cook for me.  I was in the older building. The seafood are very fresh but the way they prepare is not perfect. They over cooked my abalone and scallop.  However, it still a very good experience. Tonight I walk into one of the local supermarket, I can get the same  for half the price.  I think that why they do not displace the price. I suggest you should bring a Korean friend with you to get better deal. I spent 30k won for the food, 18k for the preparation."
20,3.0,Am sitting at one of their restaurants upstairs and eating the fresh fish I just purchased downstairs. does not get much better as an experience for a foodie.the market is easily accessed by subway and a short walk from the station.it's definitely not as impressive as Tsukiji or Sydney fish markets.The sashimi was fantastic and waiting for my lobster to be cooked.good use of my free afternoon between meetings.
21,4.0,"I'm glad I went to see this fish market. Unfortunately, I speak little to no Korean so I really couldn't communicate with vendors. And the ones I did communicate with were very nice. I would have loved to have purchased and eaten the fish but it was too much for one person to consume. Best to go in a group to enjoy fresh fish. I took line 9 exit 7."
22,3.0,"If you want to see how fish are auctioned off, come here early in the morning, about 5:30-6am. Other times, you can buy some seafood and someone will offer to go cook it for you (at a price) and you'll be able to eat at a restaurant close by. If you want fresh seafood, this is the place to have a large variety. It's cool to check it out, but other markets in Seoul offer the same experience. Unless you're buying a whole fish i'd suggest you look elsewhere. It's nice to walk through the market though."
23,4.0,"There are two parts to the market: The old building which is full of back-to-back stores of swimming fish, shrimp on ice, and all sorts of sea oddities that are edible; and the new building which has some stores sectioned off by units and escalators up to a second floor. Turns out that the new building is so new that the restaurants on the second floor were still being built when I got there! There are *some* open ones at 10:30am but the rest were either in construction or were prepping. Just a rough few tips: Technically Korean raw fish is called 'hueh' or 'hwe', but the shopkeepers are calling it 'sashimi' so we get it. Try the weird things if you dare, but at least go for the fish. Bargaining is okay, but good luck as these store keepers are hardy."
24,5.0,This huge seafood market is a mind blowing world  Every imaginable creature from the sea can be found in dozens of booths. They are alive and they are dead but they are all fascinating. You have never seen anything like it before and it will make you appreciate your fish dish at a restaurant.
25,5.0,I had to visit this place even though I had no inclination to buy anything as I was staying at a hotel. The market is 300 metres from the metro station of the same name. A great place to cure your curiosity of fish markets. Does not smell bad at all. Fresh fried fish available to all who want a bite!....without fishing!
26,3.0,"This is a working fish market - I enjoyed seeing it.  I hope folks from the city of Seoul tourism read this post.  The signage for tourists is terrible.   First, they changed the subway exit - most guides will tell you to exit 1, but that doesn't exist - its now exit 7.  When you get out of the exit, there is no signage whatsoever and it's not at all obv - ious what to do.  Most people said (in posts, and hotel concierge) - as soon as you get out of subway you'll see it.  Maybe in the old exit, but definitely not in the new exit.   There are subway signs pointing to the fish market it's just once you get outside the signs end.So....go straight out of exit 7 and go for a good 100 meters and you'll see an entrance to a plywood tunnel.  Here you will see a fish market sign - Turn right (like a u-turn sort of) into the tunnel and walk for a ways and then keep going straight and you'll see the fish market ahead of you.It's WET inside (also wish my hotel concierge would have mentioned that) - expect your shoes to get wet and smell like fish !  Most workers in their are wearing big rubber boots.     There are places with puddles at least 1-2 inches deep - so watch where you're walking.I got lost getting out - i saw one sign that said subway and followed it but then saw no other signs and couldn't figure out where I came in (it's a big place).   Pay attention to where you come in so you can figure your way back.  I'd say leave bread crumbs, but the fish would probably eat them.Other than that - it's cool to see all the fish and I'm glad I went.  I just wish there could have been a little better postings of signage."
27,5.0,"A must-go location for all seafood lovers, Noryangjin Fish Market offers the freshest seafood in Seoul. Completely different from Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo which mostly sells to wholesalers and restaurants, Noryangjin Fish Market caters more to consumers. Some stalls are also linked to restaurants upstairs which would whip up delicious dishes for you at a price, and the quality is outstanding.I was brought around by a couple Korean friends of mine, so language was not a barrier for them. However stall owners can also speak Mandarin if you wish to, but most of them can barely speak any English. Just remember to bargain!"
28,5.0,"Variety of sea creatures. Hahaha my first time seeing a live octopus and big crabs, lobsters! It's interesting to watch how people bargain and buy the seafood. They are not dead yet, before being bought. Try to watch the process of how a fish being picked to how it turns to be a plate of raw food. it's a very new experience and I spent 2 hours there watching from the second floor! Nice visit to fish market!  bring your seafood to the restaurant and eat with other dishes!"
29,3.0,"although the place is hard to find and even seem intimidating before you enter, the place seems to be a tourist trap.  There are tons of restaurant owners that are trying to get your business.  The fish shops are not super cheap.  But at least there are many live fish and weird sea creatures to see.  The best thing is you can then eat it right afterwards at the restaurants.  Just have to pick from one that you can trust.  Maybe it is best to have someone who is in the know to be there with you.  Anyways, Chinese seems to work well here, with some limited English being spoken.  The size of it is actually not very big.  Just a large indoor warehouse."
30,5.0,It was so much fun to wander among the vendors and decide exactly what you wanted to eat and then bring it to the restaurant and have them cook it. When we purchased we had to explain that we wanted only one fish versus 5 fish but my meager attempt at korean got across and we walked away with a managable amount of food to eat.
31,4.0,"Ok, it is really cool to see all the squirming creatures that one may have never known existed, and to be immersed in the Korean culture, but I agree with other tourists that it is not a high-value place to eat seafood.  To pay 15 kilowon ($15) for a small flounder and then be directed to the place that is likely run by the fishmonger's cousin to cook the fish (or one like it) for another fee, likely as high or higher, seems pretty steep to me.  Yes, the experience of fresh kill is enticing, but I don't favor my food moving in my mouth or attaching its tentacles to my airway, which apparently has happened to some hapless visitors.  I understand that some of the vendors will cook the seafood at the stall, but I either could not find such a place amongst the hundreds of vendors or did not find their set-up consistent with basic public health standards.Definitely go and enjoy the view and interaction with the people and critters.  The floor is wet, and I was prepared to wear shopping bags over my shoes based on other reviews, but it was not that bad; just walk carefully.  The smell was also not overpowering.  As for getting there, either line 1 or the new #9 will do.  If you take #9, depart the subway from exit 2 and you are only 50 yards facing the stairs going up over the #1 line and taking you to the market on the other side of the tracks.  Your nose will let you know you are in the right place by the time you get halfway over.Take lots of pictures.  Go ahead and buy, but realize you could get the same or better with all the sides elsewhere and without feeling like you have been had."
32,4.0,"Went there on the metro at 6am. After finding the nearest exit ont he map to the fish market, you will still have to ask around as there are no sign board in English. After walking for about 100m, you see painting of fish on the wall and then turn left into a underpass for the railroad. You will come to see a row of vegetables sellers before finally reaching the fish market. It is quite wet. So if you are wearing long trousers or socks with shoes, be prepared to go back home/hotel with fishy salty smell -- no matter how hard you try to avoid the wet floor. The fishes, crabs, sea urchin are really fresh and infact most still alive. And this is how a true fish market should be. Fisherman back from the catch at sea will be selling to the highest bidder as well in another section. And finally there is also a dried seafood section. Truely the best and real fish market that I have ever seen."
33,5.0,"A must visit in Seoul for a true taste of the amazing dining culture of South Korea.  Not for the faint of heart that is for sure, but a fun experience to view, buy, and then have cooked your choice of incredible seafood!  The cost can get a bit pricey depending on what you desire, but it is worth it for at least one visit.  Come hungry!"
34,5.0,"I was amazed by this fish market, which is very big, I saw fish that I never seen before, and you can also take pictures. There is also a catwalk where you can see all of it, and it's just beside Noryangjin station, it took me maybe 15 min from downtown Seoul to get there. I was much bigger than Tokyo fishmarket which I saw a week earlier. Don't bring nice shoes because maybe they will smell afterwards. LOVED IT"
35,4.0,A visit to the Noryangjin fish market will only take you 30 minutes but is well worth the time. Its really a huge place and I have never ever seen so much fish in my life at one place. Its a full commerce with Korean people buying or tasting the fishes. You will see all kinds of fish and things living in the sea - alive and ready to be sold and eaten. Metro number 9 will take you to the fish market and you will only need to walk for a few minutes. You take exit number 3 from the Metro station and walk straight until you see a bridge crossing the street. That bridge does also cross the railway (to the left) and you shall walk that way over the railway and you are there.
36,4.0,"We took taxi there and had difficulty getting a taxi to come out.But all the trouble is worth it when the fresh seafood is served,Had a giant crab (bbq), 2 abalone (bbq), giant scallop (stir fry with vege), half lobster sashimi and the other half in soup pot & fresh oyster (sashimi). One of the best meals in Seoul. Definitely going back."
37,5.0,"Very impressive wholesale fish market. Very easy access by metro and a walk across the rails on a bridge. I saw there sea creatures I did not imagine existed. It made me want to eat only sea food, even though the restaurants promote beef..."
38,4.0,"Noryangjin Fish Market is a really different experience for a foreign visitor. In this huge fresh market, there were rows and rows of every conceivable marine creature on sale for food purposes. Shellfish, fish, octopus, etc. If it swims, chances are you will find it at Noryangjin.I took the Metro to Noryangjin Station and walked across a pedestrian bridge directly into the market. Very convenient. I went somewhat early (before 08.30) to get a glimpse of the market in full swing. Many vendors had already laid out their products, a lot of which were still swimming around. Noryangjin is a fantastic photo op place. There was a splash of natural colors everywhere and vendors did not seem to mind close ups. I went there with the idea of just taking photos and not to buy things or eat there, although a selection of fish places like the one at the Tokyo fish market would have made the trip more worthwhile. Obviously, if you do not live in Seoul, there is little reason to buy fresh seafood there, except maybe the vacuum-packed fish and roe on offer.I had read that some restaurants there are quite good, with unique dishes like blue crab soup. I recommend a visit with a Korean friend if you got one and perhaps a meal at the market."
39,3.0,"I didn’t spent much time here as it wasn’t tourist friendly. Some stand can speak Chinese, but they are aggressive and I felt that they were trying to rip me off. I notice that there is one shop up stair that got a sign that say “foreigner are welcome” but as I was traveling by myself, I wasn’t dare to try it out. I only recommended this place if you know a bit of Korean or traveling with someone."
40,4.0,"I had been to Tsukiji Fish Market in Japan, but this one is definitely different. From a start, I don’t have to wake up early because Noryangjin Fish Market is open all day. And there are so many different varieties of fresh and live seafood selling really cheap here, like 5000 KRW for 10 big, fat, juicy oysters!There are numerous stalls which can cook the fresh seafood that one buys, however I was travelling alone, and was told they don’t entertain single diner and so I had to bring my purchase to one of the restaurants on the second level. And the price for processing and cooking caused almost as much as my purchase of the raw seafood! So I reckon, if you are a solo traveler, like myself,  and is residing in an apartment type of accommodation, it will be wiser and would save you lots of money to buy the seafood and cook them yourself."
41,3.0,"We spent sometime choosing a fish and prawns then they were taken to a restaurant to be prepared. I had no complaint with the food but was appalled by the dirty toilets. Worth walking through, just to see the fish and various sea creatures but I would not recommend eating here, unless you check the facilities first. Unable to recall the name of the restaurant, but it was very busy with Koreans. Food great Poor facilities"
42,2.0,"i came here at 5am on a cold wintry morning to check out this place. contrarily to what i have read in guidebooks the restaurants are not 24 hours so i did not ended up eating which would have been a highlight.The variety of seafood is amazing and i have seen prawns the size of your arms.. eating live octopuses would take some guts for me ... overall if you are not here to buy seafood and eat, the attraction only last 10 mins and its time to move on...the gallery are stacked with rubbish and being a wet market perhaps the grot is to be expected"
43,5.0,"I did both the Night Dining Tour and a private tour of Noryangjin Fish Market and had a great time at both.As a solo traveler and this being my first time in Korea, there is no way I would have been able to experience on my own the quality and authenticity that both of these tours provided. Dan's tour of the fish market was superb. I was impressed by his knowledge of the products available as well as his obviously close and positive relationships with the people working at the market. We were greeted with smiles and warmth wherever we went, and yes, the meal was definitely one that I will remember the rest of my life!  Chuck was an awesome guide for the Night Dining tour! He took us to some great spots and was very helpful with making sure we knew how to eat the food and with answering our numerous questions about Korean culture and etiquette.   The following night, I actually managed to find my way back to the place where we had BBQ pork and it was PACKED FULL with Koreans eating dinner. Definitely a good sign.Going on these tours, you'll get a chance to eat some truly incredible Korean food and be in places that tourists would  likely never get to experience. The next time I go to Seoul, I'll definitely be contacting O'ngo Food Communications again!"
44,4.0,"I had heard that this market was open round the clock.  So with at least a free evening, I figured I should check it out.  The market was located in a fairly busy area next to a train station.  The scale of the market didn't compare with Tsukiji in Tokyo but most of the stalls had a better presentation of their wares.  Not sure if it was just seasonal but clams, crabs, prawns and octopus featured very prominently.   Brightly lit, many stalls located in the front row were doing a brisk trade mainly with locals.  For the best experience, do as the locals and go in a small group, haggle with the stall owners and buy what catches your fancy, then bring the food up the restaurants on the upper floor to have it prepared could prepare it in as you like."
