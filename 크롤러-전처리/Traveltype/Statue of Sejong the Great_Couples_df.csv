0,4.0,One of the statues in the square where you can watch the palace and the mountain view behind it. Good for some photos.
1,4.0,Loved the location on the large square with the mountains in the background. We were delighted to find a door behind the statue which led to a museum about Sejong the Great where we learnt he invented the Korean alphabet!
2,4.0,"This big bronze statue of Sejong the Great (1397-1450) stands on a pedestal in the middle of  Gwanghwamun Plaza. Designed by Kim Yeong-Won and placed here in 2009, the depiction honors the scholar king, whose accomplishments include the invention of Hangeul, the Korean alphabet. We came across the statue when walking on the plaza toward the nearby Gyeongbokgung Palace.King Sejong is presented in royal attire, seated on a throne. The right arm is stretched outward and the left hand holds a book. He smiles, perhaps portraying his philosophy of love for his people. Behind the statue stand six columns with information about the king's major achievements. A door by the statue's base leads to an underground exhibition hall on the king and another about Admiral Yi Sunshin. A statue of the admiral stands about 820 feet south of this one on the plaza. We took a detour from our palace goal to visit the two halls. As history buffs, we found them both to be informative and well curated."
3,4.0,Itâ€™s a pretty cool statue to keep an eye out for as you head towards the palace - hard to miss as its in the middle of the street!
4,3.0,"In Gwanghwamun Square there are two statues, one of which is of King Sejong, who reigned from 1418 - 1450 when he died. This statue is illuminated at night and you should see it then if you are in the area."
5,4.0,"We found this statue in Gwanghwamun square. It was an imposing statue, very nice and it was built to remember a great  and respected king.  There is a free museum nearby."
6,5.0,"Remember to visit the museum under the statue.  That is the most interesting part, the history of King Sejong and the history of battles at sea with the Japanese navy."
7,4.0,"King Sejong is the 4th king of the 500 year old Joseon Dynasty and reigned for 32 years from 1418 to 1450. His contributions to the kingdom include using the principles of Confucianism in politics, advancing science and technology, strengthening Korean military while emphasizing foreign policy, and creating the Korean alphabet Hangul. An impressive resume which fully deserved a giant statue in the middle of Gwanghwamun Square!"
8,4.0,"In front of the Gyeongbokgung palace, it was interesting to see this grand statue commanding a view across the square. Worth a visit as symbolic and close to the Kin statue.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
9,4.0,I thought it was a great statue and great for pictures. We had gone to visit the palace which is within walking distance. There were a lot of school children there. If you use the hop on hop off it is close to the pick up area.
10,3.0,If you head to the City Center you will see this statue.  Be sure to learn about his gift to the people of the Korean alphabet.
11,3.0,If you are around go and see the plase. Close to the palace so walk few hundred meters to see it. Nice.
12,4.0,"This statue is obviously highly valued, as it was protected by police when we saw it. Underneath there is an underground museum about King Sejong the Great, and his story, and inventions. DIsplays about Korean writing were particularly fascinating."
13,4.0,"Located near the largest palace. Very impressive, large gold statue of the king. Great place for photography. Worth a visit!"
14,3.0,Spend a few moments admiring the statue then visit the palace or walk the streets.  It is centrally located.
15,4.0,Good photo opportunity with the Palace gate and mountains in the background. Just behind the statue is a door that leads to the underground museum. In this free museum you can get the history of Sejong and why he is one of Korea's heros.
16,4.0,"We passed by the Statue of Sejong the Great - after reading its history, he is definitely one of the greatest historical person.Worth the time to take a photo with this statue. Heard that this area will have ""rebel"" on Fri and Sat. Roads may be closed. Policemen will be sighted."
17,3.0,"If your near Gwanghwamun gate you may as well visit this statue, its about 5mins down the main road in the center."
18,3.0,"Here, you get to see the statue of Sejong the Great, who gave Korean an identity through its own Hangul language.  Otherwise, in the beginning, written language is all done in Chinese.  Where this is, you get to see the Palace at the background, and you are within walking distances away to National Performing Centre, Seoul Art Centre, Wall Gate and the Cheonggye stream.  You can easily spend half a day here.  If you haven't been to Seoul before, it's worth your while to come here."
19,4.0,Statue of Sejong the Great is in front of Gyeongbukgung Palace and also near to Bukchon village (30mins of walking). Its better to come here in the morning to enjoy cold weather (November 2016) before heading to the Palace and Palace Museum behind. It s a landmark and a need to take a photo.
20,3.0,"The statue is imposing as it sits in the middle of the walking area and the museum below was informative. It costs to enter and I am not sure if it was worth the money to go in. Done once, I wouldn't go in again although I would walk the strip again as it was pretty, relaxing and the gardens very colourful."
21,3.0,Located in front of  the gyeonggokbuk palace this statue is nice for take a photo for a short trip . go here
22,5.0,"The statue of Sejong the Great was very impressionant! Not only great to look at but you also receive a bit of knowledge of the Korean history. The location was perfect because not only is it in downtown, but you also get a wonderful view of the mountains and gate!"
23,5.0,"This is another terrific statue in Gwanghwamun Square.  Sejong shares the square with the impressive statue of Admiral Wi.  Plus, Gyeongbokgung Palace is not far from the Square, so you can combine all of the attractions at once.  The Palace has a colourful changing of the guards too.There's a subway station right there (the purple line - line 5). Sejong the Great King was a visionary too, and some of the inventions he was involved in are laid out before him in the Square - a rain gauge, a sundial and an armillary sphere.A subterranean telling of his story (and Admiral Wi) is nearby."
24,3.0,"If you are visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace, you can take straight way across the street from the palace gate. There you can see the Sejong Statue monument and take some picture."
25,4.0,In Gwanghwamun Square. Good walk around on the way to Gyeongbokgung Palace. Probably worth going to since there are a couple of attractions in the vicinity.
26,3.0,"One of the interesting monuments you will see at Gwanghwamun Square is the gilded bronze of King Sejong, erected at this location in 2009. This monument is of a seated beloved King Sejong, his right hand raised while he hold a manuscript in his left hand. Sejong seems to be smiling down on his people. Behind the Statue of King Sejong, you can find four pillars with gold reliefs portraying scenes from the King's life. In front of the statue, you will find a sundial, rain gauge and celestrial globe. These make for a nice arrangement and good photographs. At the back of the statue, you will find entrance into an underground museum area where you will find 'The Story of King Sejong' attraction, which shares space with the equally interesting 'The Story of 'The Story of Admiral Yi Sun-Shin'. This is a good opportunity to learn more about King Sejong if you are interested in this important figure in Korean history."
27,4.0,"Sejong is said to be one of the best or perhaps the best king of the entire Joseon dynasty, who among many other achievements, invented the Korean alphabet. His impressive statue on Gwanghwamun Square is also a popular meeting point."
28,3.0,"The King Sejong Statue was erected at the center of Gwanghawmun Square. Sitting with a gentle smile on his face and a book in his hand, the bronze statue of 9.5m in height celebrates the King and his great achievements. Behind the statue, there are six columns with golden carvings."
29,5.0,King sejong is an important figure in korean history.  The statue is great for taking pictures but what the king has done and history is more fascinating to know b4 visiting :)
30,3.0,I saw the statue while I was in a taxi and it's good enough for me. He created the Korean language and is a great king. A few Korean shows were done on his story.Unless you absolutely need to take a selfie with him I suppose this is one attraction you can skip.
31,3.0,"This (rebuilt) statue is an icon of the large square (Gwanghwamun) in front of Gyeongbokgung Palace. It is in honour of the Korean emperor who invented the alphabet system for the Korean language. It's a nice statue that should appear in your photo album :)P/S: I wish tourists doing jump shots could be more considerate about others ""queueing"" to get a good full shot of the statue."
32,4.0,"The statue is really imprevvise seen from the street as it is really big and predominant in surrounding contest but the most interesting thing for me has been the underground museum that you can visit by entering the statue.Everything inside was very clean and well ordered, the informations I could get from he visit were very interesting too but you need the help of someone who could translate from korean and explain more in detail because most of the informations aren't in english."
33,3.0,"Well, it is big. Otherwise I didnt find it very special. A bit scary even. Liked the small fountains in front of it though."
34,3.0,"The Statue of Sejong the great is imperious and grand stands in the center of Gwanghwamun Square. This sculptural representation entirely golden king is one of the South Korean dating from 1400 to The statue represents the king seated on a golden throne just behind the other important one which is the Admiral Yi Sun Shin statue. From here you can admire the statues, the beautiful square with the fountain, the Gwanghwamun Gate and the beautiful buildings that surround the square, in short, one of the must-see places in the city."
