I started from the World Cup Stadium and walked up the stairs.  There is the option of taking a car, which I did on the way down as it was after sunset and cold AF. Paid KW 2,000 for single trip As you go up, Seoul is revealed in bits, breathtaking really. As someone who comes from a place where we still have sweeping vistas of untainted Savannah, it was a bot sad to see the cramped up high rises and kinda feel the suffocation from so much concrete. I sat and watched the sunset over Han River and as sunsets go, definitely one of my best."

It was once a landfill that has been turned inti an ecological park. Once you reach the top, you can enjoy the fantastic view of Seoul and the Han river. The view is breathtaking and goodspot for taking pictures and relaxing."
2,5.0,"If you are interested in relaxing on a weekend or getting in some exercise, this may be your place.  If you hike up the nearly 1000 steps to the top, you get a great view of the Han River, Yoido, Seoul, etc.  (You can also walk on the trail â€” more steps but less steep).   Several bike trails, jogging trails, etc.   Enjoy the flower gardens and hanging squash tunnel."
3,5.0,"Despite being a metropolitan city, Seoul has a lot place with beautiful scenery they can offer. And this one is definitely one of it. Though it can be slightly a little bit tiring since you have to climb a lot of stairs before you reach the so called Haneul Park (Literally means Sky Park). But once you reach the end of the stairs and found this little paradise on the top of the hill, then you really feel like you're in heaven. For the best time, you might want to come here during autumn~! They have the best view in autumn~!"
4,4.0,"This is an awesome place for photos amongst tall plants (i have no idea what its called). My guess is it will be full of colours at Spring time. You get a great view of Seoul with mountain backdrops opposite the Han River. The sun also sets there so the view should be magnificent. On the other side, where the sun rise, more mountains are located.Getting here is kind of complicated. So i will summarise as easily as i could.Train to World Cup Stadium.Exit 1.As you exit, follow the stadium by the left, means the stadium is on your right. Walk by the pathway beside the main road.As you go round, keep your eyes on your left. You will see a hill with 'fan' or 'windmill' structure at the top of the hill. That is Haneul Park. Just find a crossing to get there.To the top, there are shuttles at the car park. Or, you can climb a zig-zag flight of steps (300 steps).Or, you can walk by the road path up."
5,4.0,A very nice park to chill and relax. You can choose to take a paid shuttle to go to the top of the hill or walk up the stairs. View from the top of the hill is breathtaking. Nice scenery around the park too.

7,5.0,I have visited this park only 2 times. Both on autumn season. The best time to visit this park is early november. The grass return silver. On october the grass still have green. But on october you can see cosmos garden on the park. This year the park has pink grass and kochia garden too.  I was visited at noon. The view is amazing with the orange sky.

9,5.0,"About 15 minutes walk from World Cup Stadium, the park was huge and located on a hill which required a hike passed 291 steps. It was so beautiful during late autumn with silver grass and cosmos. We walked to the end of the road to watch Seoul from the other side. I love this place, maybe the best park in Seoul!"
10,5.0,The long walk from subway station & climbing 700 meters stairs totally worth it ! When reach at the stairs from subway station (about 5 minute walk) kindly have a a few minutes break before continue the journey to climb the stairs. The views are superb on Autumn ( I visit on early Nov) & enjoy taking photos up there ! When going back if you want to have a coffee break there is cafe near stadium ( A Twosome Place)
11,5.0,"I came here in the spring of 2015 and after climbing those 200+ steps, I was so disappointed that everything was cut down and ugly. I made such a great effort to come here, after just getting over the flu the day before.  After reading reviews, apparently the best time to come is in the Fall.  I will definitely make it back here one day when it is more picturesque.  The little brick pathway with the trees on the sides was still pretty even though the fields were not."
12,3.0,"I climbed up the stairs for the view, but it wasn't anything special. I didn't get the chance to explore the other areas of the park. The bridge in front of the stairs was full of flowers so it looked beautiful! Other than that, the stairs are not a must."
13,5.0,It's gonna be your leg day! But it worth every steps you take to reach the top. This park gives 360 degree views of Seoul. Plus the eulalia field.. it was just breathtaking!
14,5.0,"I was here in Oct and coincide with their silver grass festival. I must say KTO really do an excellent job promoting.I understand usually the park is closed in the evening, but during this festival, they remained open. Nearest subway station is World Cup Stadium station. Signage are clear during this festival ( all in Koreans though)  and I'm not sure if there'll be enough signs during normal day.I was following taking a chance and following he crowd ðŸ˜‚Good for a walk after dinner or couple dating. Heels are not advisable. It's a slope uphill. But definitely worth it. Check the weather if you are going as it may get chilly uphill."
