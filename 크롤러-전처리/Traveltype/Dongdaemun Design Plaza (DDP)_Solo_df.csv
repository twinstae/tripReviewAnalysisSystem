0,3.0,From the outside amazing architecture; just simply amazing but as soon as you step inside the magic disappear rapidly. The space seems to be very poorly used and there is so little design that you wonder where you are. So much potential totally wasted.
1,5.0,"A short walk from the JW Marriott Dongdaemun Square Seoul leads to one of the world‚Äôs most impressive and incredible architectural designs, the free flowing futuristic structure of the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (known as the DDP) where history marries the present and embraces the future.  Designed by the late internationally acclaimed Pritzker Architecture Prize recipient, visionary Zaha Hadid, Dongdaemun Design Plaza, frequented by both tourists and locals, greets all with the notable humanistic art of architecture.  It imparts a feeling of liquid, fluid metal.  Seoul, the capital city of South Korea, home to 10 million people, is a modern world mega-city, designated in the year 2010 as the ‚ÄúWorld Design Capital.‚Äù It is indeed fitting that he Dongdaemun Design Plaza so elegantly captures the beauty and energy of Seoul.The Dongdaemun Design Plaza is home to the Dongdaemun History and Culture Park, featuring the Dongdaemun Relic Area 2, an archaeological site discovered at the former baseball field of the Dongdaemun Stadium Complex, yielding knowledge about the life of Korean people during the Joseon period.  The tile-paved path believed to relate to the Japanese colonial period connects the building sites and the Well Site and Fireplace Feature depicted along the path.  The dual-languages of the signage of the site are Korean and English.  In the midst of this extraordinary mega-city of Seoul, resides peace and tranquility.The Dongdaemun Design Plaza also is home to eateries, coffee shops, art, gigantic sculptures, a rooftop park, bi-lingual tours of the Dongdaemun Design Plaza, and so much more to experience."
2,2.0,"It is a iconic piece of architecture on a monumental scale. It was a huge disappointment though, there was almost no content and so much of the museum space was closed or empty. The shopping area was billed as a design market, it was not at all curated as ‚Äúdesign‚Äù goods. The remains of historical buildings in and amongst the futuristic mega buildings were the most interesting parts of the park. Overall, the sheer bleakness of the interior was fascinating, but I was very frustrated at the lack of museum content. The one small exhibit gallery with exhibits in it was okay, but not of a scale to fit this giant park. So, be aware that besides the giant swooping building, there isn‚Äôt anything else to see.The central stair in the design building is amazing, there is some striking architecture."
3,5.0,Very nice to walk around and see this very modern building. Nice and not so big shopping mall as well
4,5.0,The building is very attractive in design. There are spaces for exchibitions in the building. There are art shops and restaurants as well
5,5.0,It is a wonderful place to visit. Great architecture and atmosphere. They have different exhibitions.
6,5.0,"Glad to be a witness of Zaha Hadid‚Äôs work in Seoul, all the curves and the details that house all the creative spaces in the complex such as museums, galleries, multi-purpose halls, markets and restaurants, such eye candies."
7,5.0,Impressive art in the building. It suit the city scenarios very well not disturbing at all.Inside also it could be a surprise.
8,4.0,Some interactive design fun with chairs and pianos. This will either be a nice rest stop as there are tons of seating options inside and some lay down options outside or an enjoyable hangout spot if you enjoy design and art. Possibly a great place to get high quality gifts.
9,4.0,This place is good start for people who are still beginner in understanding minimalist art and urban landscape. The unique thing about this museum in my opinion that it is the pioneer of art sharing which is seen globally in terms of minimalist and urban art.
10,4.0,"This plaza stands out in Dongdaemun area, with its large and unique design building. It is used to host various exhibitions, fashion shows, conferences etc. The building consists of the Art Hall, Museum, Design Laboratory, Oullim Square and Dongdaemun History & Culture Park. Just behind the plaza is a small and quiet park, with many free seats with umbrella covers."
11,4.0,this design plaza is a sleek soft metal building with surrounding galleries shops & restaurants which is all very interesting and fun for the entire family!  there is also the river close by below ground level to explore or picnic‚ÄºÔ∏èüëç
12,5.0,The way its made it's super unique and beautiful. Situated in the biggest shopping district of Seoul. This area is surrounded by malls. Must visit to click some great pictures
13,5.0,"Don't miss a visit to the DDP if you want to get away from temples for a while and see an ultra-modern side of Seoul. Aside from the architecture, the centre has other attractions, and shops. When I visited there was a Disney Animation exhibition. Definitely worth seeing. Oh, and if you play the piano, there are several dotted around the complex. Just sit down and play!"
14,3.0,"I may have selected the wrong time to visit so take that into account. First, if you enjoy architecture, the building itself is so unique and beautiful that you can‚Äôt go wrong. The building, the artistic statues outside (perhaps the correct term would be sculptures?) are definitely worth seeing in person. The interior is peaceful and calm which contradicts what you might anticipate looking at the space age like exterior. However, there wasn‚Äôt a lot going on inside during my particular visit. If you have young kids, they would have fun on I believe it was the third or possibly fourth floor."
15,5.0,Beautiful structure.  I was so amazed how it was done.  You have to see it for yourself. One of the best place I have visited in South Korea.  Superb üòä
16,4.0,"I came shopping here around Dongdaemun area, and came upon this beautiful design plaza. It is a great picture opportunity, and you can sit or drink and eat around here. They have places for you to sit, and just chill. This plaza is just right behind the station. It is convenient and nice to get to."
17,4.0,Its good to see in the daylight but more spectacular at night with all the LED flowers all light up too.There is a cafe inside..Looks like a huge spaceship with its many windows.lots of photo opportunities.The steps leading out of the area are also light up.
18,5.0,If you like architecture and are interested in design you definitely should take at least a walk around this spacious building. You can also go to the design exhibition.
19,5.0,A huge design of greatness with glimpse of city‚Äôs history and culture. Went there to watch the rose lights but arrived before dark. Amazed. Bejeweled. Enchanted. Must see!
20,5.0,"Easy access to this wonderful sight to behold. One of Zaha Hadids final master pieces. I visited unknowingly on the anniversary of her death of 31.03, 3 years ago and you can see the reason she was famous. It‚Äôs an architectural piece of art for the ages. I am stunned looking at the curves of the building and then to find out it‚Äôs mostly usable space was incredible. I thought it would be simply design, but it‚Äôs functional which makes it doubly amazing. I absolutely loved every aspect of the building and the exhibits. Another South Korean architectural marvel."
21,5.0,"I love this beautiful place and there are so many good place for shopping around here. One of my friend studying in Korea, she said there's good place for gift and suvenir shop around here. It was small shop naems 'Gwanghui Pharmacy'. They sell various health supplement for skin. When I went there, there were so many asian tourists from other countries. I bought some product for skin and constipation. Those were really easy to bring and quite delicious. I recommend you guys to visit that shop if you guys are around DDP."
22,4.0,"I didn‚Äôt go inside, and suspect that it is even more impressive at night, but it is impressive to be sure. You can exit the subway station directly to it."
23,5.0,The building alone is worth the time and then there is so much more going on - I took a couple of hours looking around - it is very organic form and I was really interested in the planting scheme as well. Lovely that there were pianos dotted around for anyone to play when i was there and the very nice restaurants inside too.
24,5.0,This is a must see building in Dongdaemun.  It looks like a space ship at night with glistering lights all around.   The inside is white with curves and angles on the stairways that are pleasing to the eyes. There was an art exhibition on the ground floor and interesting design items for sale when I was there in the beginining of Feburary.  There are two cafeterias that I can see on the top floor.  They even have a piano outside around the middle entrance under cover for passerbys to display their talents.  You can easily spend half a day there if you are into art and design.
25,3.0,"Apart from the unique architecture, there isn't much to do here. Wouldn't recommend coming all the way for this."
26,5.0,"Dongdaemun design plaza designed by Zaha Hadid is beautiful and futuristic with curvaceous forms. There is artwork exhibited, a cafe and much more. I enjoyed walking around it and admiring the beatiful forms. There are also other stores and restaurants in the surrounding area."
27,4.0,"I visited Dongdaemun Design Plaza when I when to visit the Dongdaemun Market. It is nearby and you have to visit this place to enjoy its unique architecture. It is a major cultural complex and host events such as Korean Fashion Week and so on. But if not for those shows, you just visit the place to appreciate its unique design and architecture."
28,5.0,"It is a rare opportunity to visit the Master Architect of the world, Zaha Hadid. Walk inside and outside and enjoy this rare piece of art, Magnificent and FREE!"
29,4.0,South Koreans joke about how this place looks like a spaceship. There's not much to see in the inside if there are no events like the Seoul Fashion Show. It is the outside that will be fun for most of tourists. You'll get nice Instagram photos here.
30,5.0,This was very near my hotel and it was really impressive at night. The building was lit up and looked very modern. There was so much to do around the building. Highly recommended.
31,5.0,"Checked out Dongdaemun Design Plaza at night. Cool to see it all lit up! Close to a market. Had someone playing the piano, and a neat LED flower garden."
32,4.0,"During my short trip to Seoul, I tried to walk around the city as much as I could and found that stumbling upon the DDP around night was one of the highlights of my time there. It's absolutely stunning, there's ample space to just sit and relax, chat with friends, or take in the sights. Lots of stores as well, including a LINE Friends one that was super interesting to check out and do some souvenir shopping at. Not sure it this would still be here but there were also lots of pop-up pianos that you were welcome to use and created a really awesome atmosphere. Nearby electronic rose garden was also absolutely stunning. Overall, even if you can't stay long, definitely try to stop by the DDP during your time in Seoul."
33,4.0,Love how this place offer bazzars and some events. They have some good places to go. My favorite is kakao store^^
34,3.0,"It‚Äôs definitely worth seeing and walking around the exterior of this building but it wasn‚Äôt worth paying 10,000 Won to visit the museum inside.  There wasn‚Äôt much in the museum and it featured some drawings, paintings, and hanboks.  There was a gift shop in the museum."
35,4.0,"Beautiful building designed by Zaha Hadid.  Even though nothing of interest went on inside or around the building for me, it is worth an hour just to look around the building."
36,5.0,"I was amazed by this building, seeing all the curves.  I am an engineer so i appreciate from its exterior alone.  I wonder how they have drawn this. There were nice buildings also within the vicinity so i guess visiting this place is worth it from the shopping plazas around here.  There is alao an ancient Seoul city wall under and a LED rose garden which is better seen at night."
37,4.0,"Stunning architecture and well worth a look particularly in the evening. For those interested in reasonably priced Korean fashion, its proximity to the Nandaemun fashion malls is an extra plus"
38,5.0,The design of the building is fabulous! At night it looks amazing. It shows Seoul¬¥s modernity. I recommend to visit it.
39,3.0,The only unique experience here is the building features and the way the path is design. Building is quite big and there is a mini flea market going on the day I was visiting. Thus there are some local product on sales where they promote their products.
40,3.0,The only nice thing I saw around this place is the colorful piano. The white roses looks dirty already and even their lights are getting dimmer. Hope they clean or fix them tho. They look better when brighter. You can spend a hour or two here and that's it unless there's an event or something.
41,4.0,"Their operating hour is Tuesday-Sunday from 10AM to 7PM with extended hours of up to 9PM during Wednesdays and Fridays. This landmark is very accessible since it is connected to Seoul Subway through ‚ÄúDongdaemun History & Culture Park Station‚Äù. There are also a lot of shopping malls and duty free shops around the area, including stalls that appeared to turn into a street market at night."
42,5.0,It's an amazing center of design and market. The architecture looks like a spacecraft and inside you find many shops and restaurants. Don't miss it!
43,5.0,"If you are into modern design and architecture, this is the place to visit. Designed by the late Zaha Hadid, marvelous building"
44,4.0,"I enjoyed seeing and being there, it was something  unusual  but interesting  and modern, there were many traditional  restaurants  nearby."
45,5.0,"Modern space. Good shops and restaurants inside. I tried Aori ramen! They have cubicles for the introverts! I just didn't have much fun because, there are a couple of couples on my left and right who wouldn't stop chatting. The division didn't stop them. But the food was delicious. I will be back this springtime! Yay!"
46,5.0,"A must see when in Seoul.  For photographers of all levels, this massive and unique design looks spectacular at night.  During the day, it is a wonderful place to find younger locals who are always willing to practice their English with you....and of course a selfie or two!"
47,5.0,"Although there are still some minor works going on in the interior and exterior, this is an extremely avantgardistic and impressive project - at the site of a former stadium. Don‚Äôt miss the self-guided audio tour (4000 Won) with good background information on 16 stops outside and inside the complex. Also some design oriented shopping opportunities on site."
48,5.0,designed by zaha hadid. many exhibitions are open here. also there are many designed shop in DDP.
49,5.0,"one of the must-see places in Asia I'd say. It is very futuristic, zaha hadid made an incredible design. The shops downstairs offer designer gadgets, clothing, home accessories, toys, etc. It is an incredible place, and the coffee shop is nice, I suggest getting a mango beverage."
50,5.0,"This is a wonderful, modern complex that is stunning to view just from the outside. Inside are many galleries and exhibitions and the interior design is equally as impressive as the exterior. Some of the exhibits do charge, but the complex as a whole is free."
51,5.0,Was floored by this building. Great for photo opportunities.  Very unique style.  Lots of querky gift shops inside too which are good for souvenirs.  Located right by metro exit.  Make sure you spend some good time here to look around. Lots to see
52,2.0,I guess check it out if you're in the Dongdaemun area for shopping? Nothing to do here besides get overpriced coffee and take photos.
53,4.0,"happen to drop by... it is via Dongdaemun History & Culture Park subway line, which i cannot remember now. but it is nice to just wander around this area and visit the shops in the plaza..there is also a tourist centre downstairs where u can sign up for tours, etc. or simply take a brochure or two.."
54,5.0,Artistic modern design it was really open my eyes must go place in SeoulThen walk inside the culture park you will see the LED light roses field...main reason what's attract girls tourists to go there
55,4.0,the building is beautiful but not quite sure what's inside this magnificent building.but at least the exterior of the building and the historic park were amazing
56,4.0,"The LED roses were really pretty at night, thats the only reason I went there.. haha.. and there is a Kakao friend store too!"
57,4.0,"Nice building, stunning architecture. The building houses some small museums but I did not visit them. It's located in a very nice area with lot of shops, restaurants and foodstalls. Also there is a market of such which sells everything from phonecases to socks and pots & pans."
58,3.0,It is worth of stepping out the metro for 10 min and taking a photo but not much more. Exhibits and shops inside are boring and only interesting place is the black hole like tunnel they showcase on photos.
59,5.0,I have never seen so much shopping in my life. There were hundreds of stalls and stores in the area. You can buy wholesale and also by the peace. Anything you need for a home or to wear is found here. I purchased many items. A must see.
60,3.0,"This is an up and coming tourist attraction mainly because of its initial appearance to a korean drama, My Love from Another Star. But the place is really a work of art that houses different art exhibits and other events. Go here at night to see the entertaining light display of the whole plaza"
61,4.0,"Impressive design. Nearby park where you can also take some pictures. I was really impressed with the design of the building. Was not able to visit the shops though, will check them out next time."
62,4.0,Went there on a Monday and found out it was closed. But decided to visit the design shop on the 2nd floor and found some nice unique boutiques. Hope to return in the future to check out more.
63,4.0,"Very unique architecture building! A landmark in Dongdaemun designed by the world renowned architect Zaha Hadid. It features over 40,000 aluminum panels on the exterior walls. There are exhibition spaces, design museum, sky lounge, rest area and a souvenir shop. Several museum, some free some need a small fee. The Location: Subway Line 2, 4, 5, Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station, Exit 1 or 2"
64,4.0,Went to this place one Sunday morning-- I had a good time just taking photos from the outside.. its quite big.. accessible via the train..
65,5.0,In the hectic Dongdaemun i loved spending time watching the architecture here. Lots of good photo ops.
66,5.0,It is nice designed building and there are small interesting shops inside. You can buy unique goods there. Also its neighbors are interesting such as shopping malls and nice restaurants.
67,4.0,It is one of the stylish places in Seoul. Please check some exhibition in this place if any - some of them are very popular. You can also approach many famous and inexpensive markets near this place.
68,4.0,"It looks like a space ship to me and I like its cool design. There is museum, gift shops, tourist info center inside it."
69,4.0,"If you are interested in Modern design structures that push the envelope, then this is certainly worth a visit and walk round. Lots of shops inside and a museum, and there are cafes and snack carts outside."
70,5.0,"This place is very beautiful, especially if you like modern architecture. Reminds me a bit of Chicago. There is a very nice design shop there that sells different kinds of stuff (the kind of things you can buy from MoMa shop in New York). There is a place that can 3D-print stuff for you. There is another place that can take pictures of you from every angle, and then 3D-prints you. Yes, you. A miniature 3D figure of yourself. There are many samples to see from.Dondaemun Design Plaza is a 20-30 min walk from Myeongdong, I guess. In my opinion, it is a must-see in Seoul. 5 stars."
71,4.0,"I lived near this place, so visited it several times. The place is worth visiting by those who follow the modern trends in fashion, as well as by those who would like to look different from the conventional crowd. The prices are high, so there's no way you will find smth cheap."
72,4.0,"I have visited the DDP a couple of times. The building is artistically designed and it is a pleasure to see it both inside and from outside. There are various display stores. Next to it is the ancient wall and the LED rose garden. Both are worth seeing, but go at night, in order to experience the beauty of the lights. One of the Dongdaemum exits goes straight into the building and it is centrally located."
73,5.0,"Gosh,  every time I visit Seoul, I'm always amazed how everything is so modern,  clean and new.  I then contrast it with San Francisco and see how far behind we are in museums,  infrastructure,  shops,  etc.  Even though Seoul is nearly 10x larger in population and 5x size wise,  Seoul feels refreshingly accessible wherever you want to go while you can't even get on a train to Chinatown or the Marina in SF.  Anyway,  go inside (it's free or very low cost like most Korean museums)  and marvel at all the open space,  light,  and avant-garde art and displays.  I remember when I first saw this building being constructed in 2011 and then to see it completed a few years later,  I was just amazed.  I think its a worthwhile place to visit and its conveniently located right next to all the shopping in Dongdaemun."
74,3.0,I visited this place at night to avoid the crowds since I did not plan on entering the museum.  It offers an outdoor space with seating and plenty of places to eat in the surrounding area.  I was able to walk through the design plaza grounds under an hour
75,4.0,"Very odd, curvy, futuristic architecture. Feels like you are beneath the U.S.S. Enterprise. Was there at night, not sure what goes on during the day."
76,4.0,"Dongdaemun is very close to Insadong, if my memory serves right, it was only two stops from the Jongno 3 ga station(blue line). I went there around 11 p.m., the design plaza was closed, but there was a lot of people still around.There are two large areas near the subway station.Mind you it is a large area and you will have to walk a lot.The area around the mall, across from the design plaza has lot of vendors along the streets. I saw shoes ( good quality) casual and formal wear, going for around $40.Just be mindful that the subway closes around midnight.Plan your trip so that you will not miss the last train.Be prepared to spend 2-3 hours here, so I would suggest go early.,The led flower lights outside the design plaza was not lit at 11 p,.m.. I figure that they turn them off when the design plaza(DDP) closes. Check the design plaza hours before you go there.Do not miss this area."
77,4.0,I went here to see the museum designed by Zaha Hadid but was mesmerized by how it flows into the landscape and becomes more of a park than a museum.
78,5.0,"One of the most intriguing pieces of contemporary sculptural architecture to be found anywhere in the World. Buildings containing exhibition spaces, designer outlets, a shopping mall, art galleries and eateries. Outside spaces formed to provide gardens, market places and outdoor performance venuesAt night tome the place takes on a dazzling appearance with spectacular lighting and the backdrop of dramatic neon rainbow lit department stores. The ""rose"" garden with 1000's of illuminated flower heads is a pretty sight indeedVisitor amenities and information all excellent"
79,4.0,"The futuristic architecture alone is good reason to visit this place. At the time I visited they had a huge outdoor flower display where each flower was lit by a small bulb, amazing sight at night. Aside from the ultra modern design of the building, particularly at night there isn't a lot to do here. It is however in the Dongdaemun shopping area with plenty of shopping and dining options around."
80,5.0,Remarkable design to display urban architecture.  Even better at night with the illumination from the buildings and structures. Job well done!
81,5.0,"The building itself is a nice work of art.  It also contains art, exhibitions, restaurants, and shops.  There is a lot to see, shop, and eat around Dongdaemun and I feel this is the centre for it all.  It also hosts a night market on the weekends in the summer."
82,5.0,Totally unique.  Loved the design of the building and the furniture. So much to look at.  Great way to spend a day walking and enjoying the terrific art.
83,5.0,"You can't just drive past, although you need to step back to see it as well as getting close up and inside. Dramatic bridges and staircases, a lovely rooftop green space, many interesting galleries, and the night lighting of the exterior is deeply affecting."
84,5.0,It looks like living biolumistic space station. There are major parts of ddp such as led rose garden ddp shop ddp design museum etc
85,3.0,"DDP itself is unique in its architectural design, and even more beautiful at night with different lighting effect. When I was there, hundreds of LED flowers were planted and being lit up at night around the building, It was simply splendid."
86,4.0,Great shopping! I was there during Children's Day. The kids had more than enough to do. The shape of the building is wild! GO!
87,5.0,I just stopped by without going in. Make a stop while in Seoul. At least for a short while. Also close to the city wall of Seoul and a few other landmarks and markets.
88,5.0,"A must visit in Seoul. Great place to wonder around. Very easy to reach by subway. You can just keep looking the whole structure. Its so irregular shaped but amazingly organized and without any corners. Lot of art exhibitions, shops, cafes inside. A great place for evening hang out.The beauty becomes more lively after sunset when lights turns on and gives the whole place a brand new look. The Les rose garden will just amaze you."
89,4.0,Great place to wonder about and lean about the history of Seoul as well as see some modern art exhibitions. Great food van market at night but I had already eaten. Beautiful LED flowers. Well worth a look.
90,5.0,Design Plaza in Dongdemungu has a visual and new seoul cultural attraction. Frank Architectural design in combination with outdoor frienship garden is the must choice for unforgetable walkaround in Seoul
91,3.0,"Interesting buildings and designs gathered in one place, but nothing truly spectacular unless you are an architecture fanatic or looking to shop in the malls nearby. Give it a miss if you're short on time."
92,3.0,"I wish I would have been impressed, but I wasn't. I have to state that I visited during the day and from afar and later looking from the Seoul wall it did seem interesting, but the moment to go closer it is just okay. Greatly enjoyed the Design Lab space. But one thing that stuck out to me is the endless amount of just space with nothing in it. A nice visit while in that area, but going there extra isn't necessary. Though I might add that several shopping centers are close by!"
93,5.0,"You can discover interesting exhibitions and most awesome Korean design stores. If it's your thing, then go for it. A plus, it's been quite a nice experience discovering this fascinating contemporary building by British architect Zaha Hadid."
94,5.0,"The vibe around here is sure to excite a weary traveller. This is a unique construction that screams to be explored.After wandering around we discovered a marker for a flame. But it was not the Olympic torch. It appears that this is an urban renewal project built on the site of a former stadium. We only deduced this after seeing the two light towers that are still standing at one end of the site.It is also a massive project and the immensity can only be appreciated from high above. Luckily, it possible to do this from the 10th floor of the Doota Duty Free Store which is just across the road.Full credit to Zaha Hadid, the architect and the city of Seoul."
95,4.0,"The smooth curving design overwhelms the space and the lines draw you inside for great exhibits, in particular those sponsored by the Alliance Francaise."
96,4.0,"It's easy to go there by subway and if you didn't found the place that you want to visit, you just ask someone at there. They're so helpful and friendly. And the market is too near but you should go there before 9 p.m. because this time, the food shop is closing.Hope u enjoy at there and I'll go back there again."
97,4.0,The building designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid is spectacular.  Beautiful lines and spaces ... check out the information desk alone.  Have to visit the Design shop ... great unique finds.
98,5.0,Zaha's World. It has nothing to do with the former field but it seems like a great place to relax and spend time with your friends.
99,5.0,"I visited the DDP twice on separate trips. I can say that both times I enjoyed touring through and around this marvelous piece of art. The smooth, sloping curves of the structure really stand out against the surrounding area of tall, rigid buildings. I would allocate a good 2-3 hours touring the grounds, split between the exterior and interior. You can walk to the top of the building via a sloped sidewalk that melds into the building. Then you can make your way down floor by floor and look at any art exhibits you desire. The best part is that you can do all this for free if you don't want to see any of the special exhibits. Location wise, it's also great to explore the adjacent areas right after your tour (my recommendation would be to walk along the Cheonggyecheon stream since its close by)."
100,5.0,"Enjoyed walking around this vast, amazing structure that concentrates on public welfare and innovation."
101,4.0,"This is a cool area to explore, especially at night. Take in the plaza and shops for some pleasant browsing."
102,3.0,"I will be honest, I dislike this style of architecture because it feels a little cold and impersonal. I felt the area needed more trees and other plants. There are some cool art exhibits worth seeing (and they frequently change) so check it out if you are in the area but I wouldn't make a special trip to come here. There are a couple small and free museums but they are a bit boring (but you might as well go inside if you are here, there are a couple of interesting exhibits inside)."
103,5.0,This beautiful building is worth a visit just for its design. Its unique shape is a marvel to see while in Seoul! I came here just because it was nearby where i was staying and was glad I did. Great place to people watch at night as well!
104,4.0,"loved seeing zaha hadid's work in real life - the building itself is incredibly awe-inspiring.  i was surprised to see a only a small section of the monster of a building dedicated to being an art gallery/museum space (the jean paul gaultier exhibit showing, which was pretty cool!), but the rest of the building was used for pop-up shopping and a few cafe's.  conveniently attached to the train station though, made for easy transport."
105,4.0,"Designed by the famed Zaha Hadid group. The architecture of this building is amazing. I would suggest go around twilight time to witness the lights coming on. Shaped like a flying saucer outside. This is a very popular date spot for locals. I think the LED rose garden is a nice addition but definitely overrated. Interior has vast exhibition space. There were 4 exhibits at the time of my visit. I chose to go to the ""Zero Waste and Upcycljng"" exhibit because it was free. There is a small cafe on 3rd floor serving drinks only. This building is also connected to subway stations in the basement. Love the architecture. A convenient stop if you are on your way to shop in Dongdaemum."
106,4.0,"It's a stunning plaza and very picture worthy, a great place to get caught up in the traffic of stylish young Seoulites. It's ""new Seoul"" while being closely adjacent to ""old Seoul"" - hopefully it stays that way. There is a fancy beer place inside the mall that is a great place to get a drink."

108,3.0,"If you're into finding unique designs, this could be the place for you. Up and coming designers have opened their stores here and the prices are ok, definitely not on the cheaper side. The building architecture is fascinating considering the area was a baseball stadium previously. Worth a visit as you just don't know what you'll find."
109,5.0,"I visited this just after Hadid passed away, and I'm so grateful that her legacy lives on. I spent 3 hours easily just roaming the complex and admiring her architectural masterpiece. Be sure to visit the Design Lab where they sell all sorts of innovative products from cute nick-nacks to clever kitchen tools and even 3D printed self-portrait statues (I was so tempted to buy one). This is really one of the most unique and trendy places in Seoul."
110,3.0,"Well, the building is quite spectacular from outside and definitely worth a look and a couple of pictures, alas it's a different story when you enter. Inside everything is ""design"": design museum (closed), design lab, design coffee, design this and that... I think that people managing this superb structure have a lot of trouble filling it. The only things that were actually working while I was there were ""design-labs"", which are nice words for small shops selling more or less any and everything, just slightly upscale in comparison to the millions of other ones in Seoul! Quite disappointing."
111,4.0,"From the outside, it looks like an art exhibition, but the inside are fill of vendors that sells quality goods. This place is excellent to browse and buy gifts to bring back home."
112,5.0,"in 2009, I couldn't see it yet but now it's in front of my eyesight for the first time! Incredible design, beautiful and modern and huge infrastructure built for public and design center solution for Seoul people."
113,4.0,"This place have a unique shape.. I do not know what it is.. There is a spacious park and it have beautiful view at night... Inside the building, there is a local designer shop, and museum of design. In underground, there is a restaurant and a lot of cosmetics shops."
114,5.0,"I love DDP. Innovative ideas, designs and structures. The best place I have visited in Seoul so far!"
115,4.0,"I was awe-struck by the sensous silver architectural form as I was passing by DDM Design Plaza. Day or night, this master-work of grand urban architecture by Zaha Hadid will strike all who cast their eyes upon its shimmering silver skin.  It rests like two giant drops of molten silver on a carpet of green.  The architecture itself was the highlight, and a good deal of time can be spent exploring around the forms and the exterior plaza.  my only reason for a 4-star rating instead of 5, was that the curated exhibits did not match up to the quality and excitement of the architecture."
116,5.0,"Almost went to a karaoke pub based on the trip advisor map, then walked a good 1.5km to find this place. Beautiful building! Totally worth the walk."
117,4.0,It a nice place to walk around in and to see lot of new things and also to see how they made 3D figure of you. And you can find many nice and good things in DDP. It's a place for all ages to see things for. Some of the things I saw there I have not seen on other stores or catalogue. If you want to buy things there then have a real good amount of money on your trip.
118,3.0,"In amporessive building, flowing through space. There are several areas (small on site museum, design centre, design museum (entrance fee), design lab, etc. it is not always very easy to find your way through the complex. if you are in the neighbourhood you should have a look."
119,5.0,"Very enjoyable futuristic design: I thought I was watching a huge spaceship!  IT was good to see an informative video of Zaha Hadid (British architect who built this design plaza) and of the building itself from a big  screen right there in one of the walls of this wonderful  site! There are very different kind of halls for meetings and lectures; stores of very exclusive and  expensive articles and I was late to get to the  Museum ( closes at 6:00 p.m.). Also there is a food court with a great  variety of restaurants. From Meyongdong area, take the number 2 Line metro and I think there are only  two stops and You get there very easily! This landmark is included just in very few tours, so you MUST look for one that includes it or get yhere  by yourself by metro."
120,4.0,"I visited this place since I read a lot about LED roses here. Turned out, the led roses is all over Seoul city especially during Christmas..haha... Architects would love this place. Everything in the buildings is just not the things you see at any other place. Even the design is unique, one of a kind..and its walking distance to dongdaemun market and cheongyecheon..a lot of places to go!"
121,5.0,"DDP(Dongdaemun Design Plaza) is a multiple podium for cultural and creative industries. It was open in 2014, Design by architect : Zaha Hadid. As the shape that Zaha always play with of design, it's no straight-line but streamline for whole building and interior space, you can enjoy the power of the curve, like you're enter to a spaceship. There's 5 part in the DDP:1.Art Hall: Holding: fashion show, new product release, speech, conference...usually, you need to buy ticket to the event holding here. 2.Museum: open indoor space, for exhibition...and also it will holding design workshop for different age.3.Design Lab: It's a platform for the own brand, you can having a great shopping experience in the place as design market (shop in shop) , there's many young designer selling their start up brand. Also there's place called ""Box Gallery"" for young designer a chance and place to releasing, display their design ideal.4.Dongdaemun History & Culture Park: It's outdoor park suround the building with nice design of landscaping. conneting Art Gallery at the B1 with the ramp, going through the indoor to outdoor space, it's very different experience for the museum space.You can spend time here to know more about Seoul via design industry, It's worthy to see."
122,5.0,I visited this place while having a transit in Inchon. It's a nice place to visit. Best is the shopping places nearby. Do visit if you are in transit and have time.
123,5.0,"I had the chance to witness the work of several designers, terrific work and outstanding Creativity , For Inspiration on different level go there, do the tour, and finish Outside with those sellers and food , and then hit the shopping street just by crosing the street, or go strait by the Wall until you get to the Top where you can get a view of SEOUL"
124,5.0,"The DDP is a thououghly stunning building but not worth the trip for the building alone. There are always changing exhibitions going on, usually free, but the main reason to be this end of town is the young fashion stores clustered around, like Doota, LotteTown and Migliore. Behing exit 7 of the subway station is Little Russia, great place for Uzbek food, especially Samarqand, down a tiny non-descript street. A good way to get to DDP is to actually walk along the Chonggyecheon Stream. It's a great stroll for a Sunday afternoon"
125,5.0,Great design element and the night view was fantastic. The LED flower was great and obviously attracted a lot of attention from couples.
126,4.0,"Enormous variety of fashions, catering primarily to a younger female audience. At night, there are plenty of street vendors offering snacks.  Most open until 1am. Beware that after 1am, taxi drivers demand exhorbitant fares (minimum 50,000 won), as the subway trains stop at midnight."
127,5.0,Impressive futuristic looking building. Very well-connected to the subway station and shopping malls
128,4.0,Just saw the building structure this evening. Really astonishingly futuristic. Kinda observed the building looks different from different angles!
129,5.0,"This building look is really particular and whether you like it or no (opinion stuff) it is really impressive! There is a cool vibe around it too with many people and cloth to buy/discover. When you visit Seoul, you should see this spot, its free ;-)"
130,4.0,"I never went inside it; however, viewing it from the outside is more than enough! The design of the structure is an leave you awe-struck. Love the curves and texture. It looks otherworldly, especially at night."
131,4.0,"Very impressive futuristic design building (Dongdaemun History & Culture Park station, Exit 1).The sea of LED roses is very beautiful at night.Unfortunately there are many inconsiderate public who pull the roses in order to take the best pix. DDP may consider deploying security officers to prevent such inconsiderate behaviour."
132,3.0,A truly impressive building the is more interesting in the night. If you are close to the plaza I would definitely recommend to see it but if you need to make an effort so it's not worth it too my opinion
133,4.0,"It's difficult to walk past this place without stopping to stare at the quirky, brilliant architecture. Some odd sculptures surround it and it is worth a look. I wandered inside expecting some shops or at least a place or two worth visiting, but it appears to have a more commercial function. An uninspired use of a brilliant building."
134,5.0,"A spectacle of present engineering , this wonder of a building is a futuristic ode to Seoul's place in the world stage of design and architecture ! A must see at night ! The building seems alive , a total compliment to the very awake Fashion Town of Seoul , Dongdaemun."
135,5.0,"Really beautifully design structure. Wonderful location to take pictures at night. Also very interesting exhibitions, this time I visited again the G-Seoul art fair which was fantastic."
136,4.0,"I will include photos of correct location, it's more like an extra 1 km east of the posted locationBeautifully, futuristic designed  building.  Interesting shops/ expos / entertaining for both young and old.Check out the products they sell in some of the shops in hall no 4 if I am not mistaking, thing maybe u can only find in Korea.Like someone mentioned before it's like Star Trek Enterprise space ship resurrected (: Enjoy Fast walk for photos only 30 min Comfy walk lots of photos and chill Recommend 1 to 2 hours I bet of history is there also on ground lever there are ruined walls or remains of old houses.Don't miss out of the fields of white artificial flowers."
137,4.0,Impressive building and quite different from what you'll usually see.  Certainly worth a trip to see just the building if not some of the shows going on.
138,5.0,"Stunning design and excellent exhibits.  The DDP also offers amazing shopping, good restaurants, and is across the street from large department stores.  Exhibits change regularly but are usually of internationally-known quality."
139,4.0,"I went there twice, once in the morning and once in the evening. In the morning, it seems like it is a quite normal museum/exhibition area. In the evening, some concerts would be held, and the park becomes a flea market."
140,5.0,"This was honestly my favorite part of my trip. I enjoy modern design and architecture, and this place has it in abundance. The Design Lab is a great spot to shop for unique items, ranging from tableware to mobile accessories to stationary. Come at sunset and see the lights come on. The LED rose garden is really something to see.When I visited, there was a nice Warhol exhibit in the museum. I believe it runs through September (2015)."
141,5.0,"Very impressive building in the middle of the modern area of Seoul. Lots of art exhibitions, sculptures and things to see. Easily, you can spend at least 3 hours walking around, taking pictures, enjoying the art galleries, or having a snack outside. Totally recommended!"
142,4.0,"Looking for inspiration to take photo? DDP is definitely a must visit Plaza for all photographers. No matter which angle you are taking it from. The photo will turned out very artistic. Due to limited time, I didn't managed to visit the interior. Judging from the other photos, it should be worth going in."
143,5.0,"Even if you do nothing but wander around within this amazing environment, you will be glad that you did - most particularly if you have an appreciation for modern, leading edge architecture.  There also are often good art exhibitions and some fine art stores with excellent restaurants of various sorts.An ideal visit would be to go there in the late afternoon to wander around, taking in the sights, then visit an art exhibition, followed by a meal.  Then, after the sun has gone down, check out the excellent architectural lighting that gives the place an almost entirely different experience."
144,4.0,"Tired of looking at grey and boring ""skyskrabers"" Dongdaemun and it's more design oriented feel and scenery with galleries, food court, shops and close to a subway station."
145,4.0,"The building design is amazing and outstanding. The plaza has everything to offer to consume your time of the day, from now until November 2015 beside the plaza is Blooming Roses garden where the lighting roses will give you an amazing moment."
146,5.0,"This place is massive! Structure is well built with metals. It also dispels the negative vibe of the metropolitan in a good way. Inside has museums, exhibits and artsy stores. Best of all, the structure perfectly fits the surrounding and is in perfect harmony with its surrounding."
147,3.0,"I can't give this any more than 3 out of 5 because I am basing this review on my own experience.  Yes I was impressed by the futuristic/out of this world designs, but there was nothing else.  Give it more/better shops and more things to do then this big @$$ building will have more use than just picture taking.  However, I think if I had come here at night, I would have given this place at least 4 out of 5.  The pictures I saw of this place at night is just wonderful."
148,4.0,"This architectural marvel is a must-see for photographers, or anyone interested in modern architecture,  A walk around the site will yield some amazing photo opportunities.  I believe it was designed by an Iranian architect and looks a bit like a space ship but also has grass growing on the roof. Whilst excavating the sight they found an old archeological site and incororated that into the display in the courtyard. Inside there are galleries some with special exhibitions.  At the moment the Andy Warhol exhibition is on and a Dior exhibition (a must for fashionistas).  They also have a kind of design department store with lots of quirky and interesting goods and a nice cafe.  I am not sure what is in many of the other buildings, as the signs are all in Korean.  There is a tourist information centre who could tell you though. The only disappointment was the shops attached to the centre, which consisted mostly of chain stores."
149,4.0,"it is a place with branded shops. you get korean leaher bags which are really great, good designs and good quality."
150,4.0,Walking around the Design Plaza is really fun. I went there last year and again this year and there were different art installations. at night you can see couple taking selfies in front of the led roses on the lawn. The lawn is a beautiful site. If you go in the shopping centers nearby you can get a nice view from the top floor.
151,5.0,"What a stunning modern/futuristic structure!   Breathtaking by day, and even more so at night.Subway lines 2, 4, and 5 take you to Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station, which exits directly into the Plaza.  Places to visit within the Plaza include multiple Art Halls, Museum, Design Labs, and the Design Market.  Also, in the midst of the modern architecture, is the Dongdaemun Excavation Site, with original sections of Seoul‚Äôs fortress wall, and a History Hall.There is a very helpful Information Desk.The plaza/park is also a great place to relax, and enjoy food/drink in the modern caf√©/restaurant.During the time I was in Seoul, the LED Rose Festival was taking place in the Plaza.  Against the backdrop of the surrounding city buildings and the futuristic plaza structure, the fields of thousands of white LED-lit roses were a fantastic spectacle. The Plaza has been open only since March 2014, so not every part of the building was populated.  However there was much to see, and I look forward to return visits in the future."
152,4.0,"The architecture loosk good at daytime and it looks great at nights when the lights are on. The shops insides sell some pretty cool designed stuffs. Walking around the building and inside is a enjoyable thing itself. If you like art, architecture and designed stuffs, this is the place you do not to miss."
153,5.0,The best place I guess would be the White Flower Garden. I'm not sure if it is still existing now but you might want to check. I believe it is better to visit during late afternoon so you can see the spectacular lights during the evening. Just across Doota so shopping is just a stone throne away.
154,5.0,"Do this venue in the evening when its dark. The great architecture becomes even stronger with the illumination.When I was there, there was an exhibition and sale of articles (gadgets, furniture, objects, tools, kitchen ware etc.) from korean designers. Good place to see and buy for design afficionados."
