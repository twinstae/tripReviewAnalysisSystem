0,5.0,"It's a a very nice please and its shops and restaurant with cafeYou can spend 5 , 6 hoursAnd you can buy to many thing"
1,5.0,This place offers a variety of places to eat from with different cuisines. The streets at night are vibey and with a lot more variety of ethnicity which I loved because my home town I see different kinds of people and after 1 week of seeing one kind of race it was REALLY so nice to see other kinds of ethnicities I’m used to seeing daily. Food was great here and with variety
2,2.0,"Itaewon does have lively nightlife going for it, but it's not really distinguishable from any other western downtown. The food is fine, and pricey and underwhelming compared other parts of Seoul. During the day, it's fairly slow and skippable. Go if you want to get wasted, wade through shifty people and party late, but don't expect cultural fulfillment or a unique experience."
3,5.0,"This is the only area in Korea that the crow are less judgemental towards different race, sexual orientation, or religion. The area attracts all sort of different locals, tourists and expat crowd."
4,5.0,"this street along with the area around it is almost international place in Seoul. plenty of small shops for clothes Korean souvenirs  that you can buy ( insure to negotiate about the price). also a lot of restaurants are there especially Arabian, Turkish restaurants. also, I found 2 Arabian groceries for those whom want to buy Arabian meals or products. I would recommend to visit during day time until 8 PM. for families, avoid the area behind the Main Street at night since a lot of bar and adult places are there."
5,4.0,"This was the street beloved by US military personnel and their families. Now, most of them have moved to Pyeongtaek and this street is much less crowded. But, still many foreign residents visit here and there are various international shops and restaurants.It's good to visit and have fun at least once.- Most foreign restaurants are too expensive. 15,000 ~ 30,000 won per person normally. I recommend some affordable lunch menus.- Both of Korean and English are available in most places.- Since there's the only mosque in Seoul, it's easy to see Muslims or halal restaurants.- There are many young Korean foodies too.- Very crowded during Itaewon Global Festival in October.- Close to Gyeongnidangil Street(경리단길) or Haebangchon Village(해방촌) that are also popular areas.- There are some romantic rooftop pubs.- Also well-known for super size clothes or military merchandises."
6,3.0,"So I am a Brit who lives in Korea and have been to Itaewon twice. As a place to go shopping it’s great, particularly if you’re a foreigner as they have many shops that cater to taller/larger people and have lots of souvenir shops. It’s so hard to find postcards in Korea but there are tonnes in Itaewon. Also you will almost always find Korean people that speak English here.If you have a couple of hours to kill it’s great. And if you’ve been in Korea long and you want to see lots of foreigners for a change go there.The down side is other than shopping, eating and drinking there’s not really that much to do so if you’re spending more than two hours there it can be a little boring. It’s great for finding foreign cuisines that otherwise you would struggle to find outside of Itaewon and great for the nightlife (if you’re into that).But it’s usually very crowded and when you have lived in Korea for a long time, it can be overwhelming.In general it’s great for shopping and souvenirs, and having a good night out."
7,5.0,"This is probably the only area in Korea that is truly international and also friendly towards all sorts of people. Locals and internationals, straight and LGBT people get along. The area has a variety of food nightlife scene. A must go on the weekends!"
8,1.0,"This lounge bar might be changing names- its a big NO.Rip off for tourists- menu and all is in Korean so later on they charge you super high prices they want. They served us a bottle of Australian wine (which is usally an average wine) and charged us 149 US $! After we asked Korean people sitting next to us to translate the menu, we realized that the manager (who is standing in front of the bar) is lying about the prices. With complain from us, he lowered the price on 80 US $, which was still not realistic and too high."
9,4.0,"Basically a place to hang out at night, lot of bars, clubs, and restaurant.Bunch of people from everywhere.A bit dirty at night but you know, that’s a place for “partying” or to come and visit before 23.But it’s safe and nobody is rude.Definitely can feel the Seoul crazy vibes"
10,4.0,"For Muslims, halal food is necessary. So, Ittaewon is a good place to find halal food, and the price was affordable. There is a mosque where you can take your time to perform your prayers."
11,4.0,"there is a huge mosque in itaewon or people called it Seoul Central Mosque... this area is filled with Moslem people from around the world, so you can easily find halal food here.. there is also a store that sell stuff or food ingredients from all over the world, it's very convenient"

There are plenty of different ethnic restaurants around this area then any part of Seoul.  A happening bar/lounge place is called ""Prost"". Good place to eat is called ""Tapas bar"" Short distances walk from each other."
18,3.0,"Not exactly my favorite place, I found it to be a little more on the dirty side compared to other places in Seoul. This is where Seoul Central Masjid is located also this neighborhood is famous for having numbers of halal restaurant, a must visit for Muslims."
19,4.0,International area for dining and wining. Plenty of bars and restaurants - mid and high end. Lots of small shops as well to do some shopping especially on day time. Most known at night as party place. One visit is not enough to enjoy the area. Explore the vicinity and try those bars and restaurants so al types and profiles. Access trough itaewon station.
20,5.0,"For me, I'd come here mainly for food. There're shops everywhere just like anywhere else, but restaurants here have more variety. They seems to be more English friendly than restaurants in other parts of the city."
21,4.0,A nice spot for tourists to see a variety of Korean culture. Many vendors speak English. Lots to eat with reasonable prices.

23,5.0,"Although there are Korean restaurants in Itaewon, most people go to Itaewon for food other than Korean. And there is everything from Bulgarian, Chinese, Japanese, South African, French, Italian, Spanish, Indian, Turkish and a lot more. My favorite vegan restaurant Plant is also located in Itaewon. Aside from the food, there are lots of shops, cafes and hotels. Worth a visit - it will be satisfying."
24,3.0,"As most people reviewed, this Main Street is mainly restaurants, bars and pubs, with the the tourist souvenirs shops. If you prefer the busy and packed atmosphere, stay in the Main area. There is nothing that differentiate this area from any others then. But if you like a serene dinner with your loved one, explore the small lanes BEHIND the Main Street. Walk up the slopes heading into the residential area just behind. It is a completed different feel from the main touristy area!! You will find many small cafes and diners scattered in the quiet residential area. This was a truly unexpected discovery for us."
25,4.0,"Itaewon is a great area for shopping, food, pubs, bars, nightlife. Custom tailors, luggage, luggage tags, lots of shopping. Pubs, bars, restaurants of all types. From an English pub to Spanish tapas, you can find it all. A great area, I recommend to anyone in the Seoul area!"
26,3.0,"Exotic quarter in Seoul where you can find Halal food and other international food, mostly western style."
27,4.0,"Itaewon Market looks like a junk yard sale. A good place to find antique stuff. If you are hungry, there are a lot of Halal restaurants especially near the mosque. To go here, take a subway to Itaewon Station (Line 6)"
28,4.0,"On weekends its totally crowded and difficult to get a seat in the popular pubs. Not far from Gangnam district, little difficult to get transport late at night."
29,4.0,Nice area to hangout specially if you are foreigner from M.E you can find halal food In the morning its nice and quite in compare with the nights I mean . Lots of drunk ppl
30,4.0,"Itaewon is an area in which the American base and many embassies and consulates are located.  As such, it has shops and restaurants focused on catering to both Korean and non-Korean nationals.  The bar district/nightlife is probably the best in Seoul."
31,3.0,"A Muslim-friendly area, Itaewon is known to have halal restaurants and shops. If you find any korean products that sell here, that's mean Muslim can buy it if they are sold outside. The well-known mosque is also located here but it only opens during the day but the compound is opened to the public all day. Mind you that this area is filled with pubs too, so take care of yourselves."
32,5.0,The international feel was strong. There were lots of restaurants selling different cuisines from different countries. A good mixture of local and international shops. A great way to experience diversity. Street views were impressive.
33,5.0,Been here lot of times. Arguably the best selection of restaurants. One of the best places to hang out during the day. Lots of foreigners
34,5.0,"Itaewon is definitely worth a visit. I only went there at nighttime and the vibe in the area was super cool and international. There are restaurants from all over the world, from Egypt to America and to Korea obviously. Besides from that there is a lot of cool bars and clubs (go to either Gold Bar or Thursday Party - cool vibe and cheap drinks!)"
35,4.0,"This place is ""the"" area to go at night as its packed with restaurants, bars, and clubs.  Lots of (mostly young) Koreans and some tourists as well.  If you like to club and drink this IS your spot."
36,4.0,Good place to spend a night or weekend. Plenty of variety for international food and lots of bars and clubs to drink in. Cheap accommodation to be found also.
37,5.0,"The Itaewon district is the most popular place among Muslims particularly as there are lots of Halal eateries there as well as Muslims grocery shops. It's clean and there's also a mosque there even though we have to climb up the road to get to the mosque. Overall, Itaewon is the nicest place to stay in Seoul."
38,4.0,"I've been to Itaewon several times over the last 10 months and everytime I go back, I always find something new or something I overlooked the previous trip. Very touristy but friendly ."
39,4.0,"This place has a lot of famous restaurants, especially foreign food ones. Some food are expensive, but mostly are reasonably priced. You can buy clothes (big size clothes are famous) and snickers also. I think the only demerit is it is hard to find parking lots on weekends."
40,3.0,"here all foreigner restaurants, stores and embassies gather. you can find almost any international food in here. also its famous for its clubs and bars at night but be careful, you can not take taxi after 12 midnight when the metro close because the taxi drivers only take people who go far so they can get the most money of them or they will not use the counter and negotiatie high unfair price with you"
41,5.0,"As you can see the rank of the Korean restaurants, most of the restaurants which are highly ranked are in Itaewon. I'd say this is the place where you can experience some kind of diversity in Seoul. There are a lot of foreigners here. It's actually pretty cool in terms of foods, clubs and bars, sort of things이태원은 정말 흥미로운 곳인 것 같습니다. 식당과 바들이 특색있어서 체인점이 우글거리는 신촌이나 건대보다 한국인에게나 외국인에게나 더 재밌는 것 같아요"
42,3.0,"It's kinda hard to find a halal food in Korea. So we heard from a friend that had been here, there's a shop in Itaewon which served Halal Korean dishes (I mean why come to Korea if you don't try the local cuisine), we got lost of course, but there's plenty of halal shop all around. There's abundant to choose from. The mosque is also here.Nearest st: Itaewon station exit 2"
43,4.0,"I love Itaewon for it's great cuisine, my favorite gay bar BUT hate it for it's dirty clubs! Why not clubs? Too many American soldiers, African immigrants and others who come their for an easy prey! There is a notion that in that area people can behave themselves in a worst way. Men come there to hook up with some drunk ladies and do not even have much respect to those who aren't interested in them. In terms of clubs, I would prefer Hongdae over Itaewon, to feel much safer."
44,4.0,A vibrant multicultural street in Seoul with many international an middle eastern restaurants. A must see street after long day of your trip to Seoul.
45,4.0,"This place is always crowded with foreigners (as well as locals) and it has a lot of different types of food. The food range from korean food to italian food and many more. There are a lot of shops nearby selling things like accessories, handmade stuffs and etc. There are also a lot of halal restaurants in this area. Cafes are everywhere. Come to this place for sightseeing, shopping and eating all the way."
46,5.0,"I had a great time shopping with my friends in this area. There were both mixes of traditional stuff and modern fashion. If you look around, you can find in the nook and crannies many other shops that have accessories, bags, and trinkets. It's a nice walk at night too with many lights and people. I went with a group of two other girls, so it was relatively safe and fun. It did take at least an hour to get tired of the place, only because of all the walking. Walking around the area is nice too."
47,5.0,"This place has everything in one. Stay - numerous guesthouses to pick from. Prices ranges cheapest compare to other places in Seoul. Most of them located very near to the subway. Eat - various kind of restaurants from local Korean food to international. For Muslim, this is definitely a heaven for food and chances to try halal Korean food. Hip cafes are spread across the area aswell. Shop/Sightseeing - Lots of small shops, try walking in smaller path. There are even underground shopping centre. My friend bought a lot of handbags at bargain price here, better than in Dongdaemun area, and less crowded too. We was trying to take picture in LINE shop in Myeong-Dong and decided not to since there was too many people. LINE fans, fret not, they have another shop here with way less crowd.Seoul Central Masjid was bigger than I imagined. Check out the mural along the path beside the masjid. Money changer - We got the best deal to exchange money here compare to other shops we saw at Myeong Dong or Hongdae area."
48,5.0,"If you're a tourist visiting Seoul and want to see another side of Seoul, just come to Itaewon! Itaewon is like a mini version of world in Seoul. You can find many people from different race and countries in this place. For foods, there are soo many options and for moslem, this is just the center of halal food that you can find.There are many stores selling halal products and Seoul Mosque also located in Itaewon. Walking around in Itaewon might help you to cure your crave of your country. And, this is the place where you can find people speaking English in every corner ;)"

50,4.0,"Upper class shopping and eating, with a western tourist orientation. Some clothing and shoes, souvenirs, also antiques shops. In Hamilton shopping mall decent prices for local products of all kinds, prices are negotiable. Lots of different cuisines and very good restaurants for those wanting other foods that Korean."
51,5.0,"it took us 15 minutes from our hotel "" Glad Hotel "" next to the National Assembly in the south to Itaewon in the north and it costed 12000 Wons equal to almost 12 US$ by taxi.the area was very much pleasant . there are lots of bars and night clubs which will for sure suites any sorts of interest. we went there in the middle of the week . so it was not busy . and there were only two places which required entry fees but the rest were with no entry fee. UN was the one we went in . it was a nice area. at about 2 am it got much busier . If you are also a fan of eating , there are lots of restaurants which can give you different taste of food . you can find almost any type of restaurant there. the second time we were there was in the Halooween night . it was superb. very busy and filled with different sort of face makeups which are in harmony with this night. Everywhere were full and all the night clubs required entry fees which varied from 10,000 to 25,000 ."
52,4.0,"Not so far from the memorial of the Korean war. It is about 15min walk up the main street. I think Itaewon is the most visited area by shopping-holic and also the largest gathering foreigners in Seoul . However I could find cheaper items in other areas.The area is full of shops, restaurants, bars etc... And if you would like to have full experience of the place, plan your trip to be in the weekend, cause the street market is held only that time."
53,3.0,"It is a cool village where you can find many different culture, restaurants and shops. I have a good experience when I was there I could see the Itaewon Global Village Festival"
54,4.0,"Itaewon seems to be a bit touristy and maybe I ordinarily wouldn't like it but we visited it on the day of vibrant festivities. Itaewon Global Village Festival really reflects the spirit of this place. Hamilton hotel's unattractive architecture does not seem to matter- it is undeniably the anchor of this neighborhood. Itaewon is about shopping, possibly partying and eating familiar things. At the entrance to the neighborhood there is a map of the area helpful in planning your exploration. The roadside stalls are even more attractive than the 2000 stores of Itaewon."
55,4.0,"I first visited Itaewon in 1985 when it was known as GI shopping and Juicy Bar area only frequented by GIs, tourist out to shoo, prostitutes and the rare or brave Koreans desiring to meet foreigners. Really The average Korean looked down on this place. But over the last few decades the place has transformed into a trendy spot filled with great restaurants and pubs frequented by locals and expats alike. The area behind the Hamilton Hotel is filled with fun pums and restaurants that ared shared between all. The night life here is vibrant and fun. Just people watching while you grab a cold one is a blast. Now if you cross the other side of the street there are still some seedy places, particularly on the hill behind the fire station. Juicy bars still remain as do transgender bars which demonstrate the changing times in Korea. One can stll shop for cheap stuff along the main drag of Itaewon-ro and its side alleys if that is your thing, but I would recommend the trendy side of the street mentioned above. Many who recall the seedy Itaewon of the past and avoid the area. But the place is fun and in a constant stage of evolution. Give it a try."
56,5.0,"love the place, awesome place, many halal food and also one supermarket selling all the halal frozen foods,"
57,5.0,"this is one place in seoul to go round september time when you still have the warmth but not so much humidity and you can go to one of the many bars or restaurants and sit people watching, or one of the rooftop terraces and meet friends. Great place and one I'll keep going back to"
58,4.0,"If you like people gazing, feel somehow transported outside of korea but still be in Korea this is your type of spot. So many foods, and cultures blending together due to the old US military post that was stationed there, but since have moved. I definitely would recommend this place for people who love to hang out at night, and just keep the party going."
59,4.0,"Itaewon is a great place to hangout with friends. There are many restaurants and bars in the area. If you want to try the traditional Korean food, then this might not be the right place. But if you wanna try some fusion food, then here is the perfect spot. They provide really good service. Also, all the architectures here are quite stylish. What's more, there is a Lady M cake boutique around the corner. So, if you need some sweetness, here is definitely what you want! Also, on the street, you could find many places selling the little souvenir stuff. You can bargain with for price."
60,1.0,"Despite the fact that Itaewon is a very multicultural area and has retained a lot of it's diversity even as it has gotten an image upgrade over the past few years, with an exponentially increasing number of trendy bars and restaurants, this gentrification has also brought an increasing amount of discrimination. Kangnam style meeting Itaewon Freedom (a lesser known music video that came from Korea before Kangnam Style - see it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N8c1t1QTDI) has meant that moneyed younger Koreans who are flocking to Itaewon are drawn largely because they think of it as an exotic foreign Disneyland. But this trend hasn't exactly brought with it a sense of ""globalization"" (a really popular word in Korea) - a real sense of ope-mindedness to foreigners. Many nightlife places in Itaewon routinely discriminate against foreigners, residents and travellers.The most recent case was club which recently started refusing entry to all foreigners. The first article which appeared this past week is here (http://www.koreaobserver.com/club-in-itaewon-denies-entry-to-foreigners-especially-those-from-middle-east-33961/) This was the original article that appeared about this issue... The real heart of the issue could actually be worse, and is explained in another article below... But the background to this speaks volumes about the ignorance, hypocrisy, xenophobia and closed-mindedness that pervades a country that claims to be ""globalized.""Basically the article explains how foreigners were banned entry except for friends and acquaintances because of trouble some people have caused in the past. The  ""door policy"" sounds very typical for many of the newer clubs in the Itaewon area that are popular with Koreans...they use the excuse that they reserve the right to refuse entry at any time to anyone... Just like the article says, this applies to anyone who ""doesn't fit the club's image""... In effect, this is used to prevent people of African, South Asian and Middle Eastern origin from entering (ostensibly because they are the ones who cause trouble - and there is at least some truth to this) while white patrons are usually fine.... But if you happen to be Westerner of the non-white persuasion, (like me) you are very far from ""fitting the club's image"", and I have had problems getting at this particular club and others, unless I'm with some white friends who can legitimize me...There are no laws against discrimination on the basis of race in Korea, and such ""entrance policies are also found in other nightlife areas in Seoul such as Kangnam and the area around Hongik University (this article explains more: http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2988812), as well as other nightlife venues in cities across Korea. Articles such as these appear fairly commonly in English media.In this case, the real heart of the issue is explained in a second article, where the manager of the club explicitly says that he banned all foreigners because his customers are afraid of catching MERS. The article is here: (http://www.koreaobserver.com/club-in-seoul-bans-entry-to-foreigners-over-fears-of-mers-34351/) - if you read it you can see his explanation in his own words (he also repeats the justification that he is entitled to do this because some non-Western foreigners have caused trouble in the past.) This is not the first time this has happened - last year a very popular bar (and one of the diminishing number of truly mixed nightspots) banned all African patrons because of fears over Ebola AT THE REQUEST OF KOREAN PATRONS. This bar is co-owned by a Korean and an expat. It reached the Western media (http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/signs-s-korean-pub-bans-africans-article-1.1907500) but to be fair in this case the owners quickly apologized and tried to set things right.  That has not been the case with this most recent incident. There is no official response from the Korea National Tourism Organization, the Seoul Metropolitan Government, or the Itaewon Special Tourism Zone about any of these matters. As a resident of Korea, what bothers me most is how many Korean people coming to Itaewon (a supposed sign of how open-minded they are) accept this kind of discrimination, with the refain that ""this is Korea."" It IS a part of life here, it IS a part of the cultural thinking (for a variety of historical and social reasons.) But still, I have to wonder how many people actually share these feelings (as opposed to those who accept it without really thinking of questioning it.) How many of the young adults that I teach might feel this way? It bothers me to think that even a few might - not knowing how many share the kind of thinking that has lead to this status quo is one the most unsettling questions I have had in all my years in Korea."
61,3.0,Visited the area to look at suit tailoring for the hubby. There's a lot of multicultural food stores all around. Foreigners all seem to hang around the area. Lots and lots and lots of Tailors to chose from. Prices for items and food seems to be a bit more mid level. Isn't a must see area in my opinion but worth checking if your looking for custom suits for both men and women.
62,4.0,"We rushed home to get ready for another night of fun. Lidia decided to stay home this time because she couldn’t keep up with our party life. While waiting for our friend Tom to arrive, we decided to go downstairs to grab a quick bite and pre-drink. My partner, however, forgot the Wi-Fi hotspot upstairs which we needed to contact Tom. Most of the door locks in Seoul are passcode protected. No knocking or keys required. We thought it was a really cool and nifty feature. Big mistake. As soon as the door unlocked we saw my best friend running in the bluff towards the restroom exposing her backside. What she failed to realize while running towards the restroom was that the closet in front of the restroom also had a full-length mirror. Yeah. We quickly grabbed the Wi-Fi and ran out of there all knowing never to speak of this event again.After a few train rides we arrived in Itaewon, also known as the melting pot of diversity of South Korea. Foreigners from all over the world transcend to the area to meet and party with other foreigners and locals alike. The U.S. military is also stationed here so it was nice to sporadically hear English.As I was waiting for my partner to use the restroom, I started walking around the corner and got startled as a woman popped out of the doorway gesturing me to “come here” to her. I immediately thought “what the hell” and kept walking. Another man walked by the doorway, but this time a completely different woman popped out saying “good time?” Ladies and gentleman, I was standing next to a brothel. It was a never-ending cycle throughout my 10 minutes of waiting. After Vu was finally done, things got weirder. A heavy-set woman, obviously drunk on the ground across from the brothel, kept telling my boyfriend and I “you guys are so sexy. You want to see my d!#$? I have big d!#$.” Needless to say it was an experience we won’t soon forget."
63,4.0,"On May 22nd, our school went on a field trip to Itaewon. Although we didn't have much time, we were able to spot a few distinct characteristics of the place. Itaewon was full of many different shops that were owned by people from diverse countries as well as the products. We didn't have much time to look around in most of the shops, but it would have been enjoyable if we did. We went to My Chi Chi's for lunch, which had mainly Italian food, but also fusion of other different countries. We ordered a pizza, spaghetti, and two main meals which contained chicken and salad. The food was good, but did not meet my expectations. I think the price was well set although it was a bit expensive. However, I would go to another restaurant if I visit Itaewon again."
64,4.0,"From the first moment of the day when I received the parental consent form of the trip to Itaewon, located in Seoul, I was extremely excited. I felt happy that I actually got a fantastic opportunity to learn new things about other cultures in the world. Since I already knew briefly about the place, I expected myself to eat foreign food like Mexican, or Turkish, etc...And in the reality, me and the other 5 grade 10 boys had an awesome scavenger hunt there in Itaewon, after the arrival and some brief explanations by the teachers. Together, we saw many things, and met many foreigners while we walked around. We saw lots of foreign food, clothes, masks, signs that were written in foreign languages, and people who were not talking in English. Me and the other boys had a very pleasant meal in a Turkish Restaurant Pasha. I had chicken chops and Turkish drink tamek, Tamek was an attractive drink, Maybe I can have it next time, if there's some time for me in the future,There, I was fascinated by a unique Turkish sauce and the taste of it. And also, I felt delighted that the workers in Pasha were very kind to us. We asked some questions in the scavenger hunt, and every time, the men offered the answer with so much kindness. For that, we appreciated them. I still remember their smiling faces, and their words that they didn't get any discriminations while living in Korea, and that Koreans like kebab a lot.I personally hope for more experiences which I might have next time, Any way, I felt happy this time, since my school CMIS provided this valuable chance to all of the seniors of the school."
65,3.0,There are quite a few trendy stores....if you can find them as they hide in corners and upstairs. Quite a bit of foreign influence here and about the only place in Seoul you will be understood speaking English. We are happy to find understandable signs. The shopping street is short but great to hangout.
66,4.0,"Good place to hang out and eat. There are a lot of ""pubs"" and fun night life. You can get Guinness, other imports, or local beer in most places. There are many cuisine choices as well-from BBQ pork belly to pasta."
67,4.0,"there's so many restaurant and clubs here, you could take a scroll first and decide which one is your favorite. It's better to come here with friends and have a good time."
68,4.0,"Itaewon is known as the ""international"" neighborhood of the city, thanks in part to its proximity to the nearby US Army Yongsan Garrison. As such, this is easily the area where you will meet the most foreigners (US troops, but now mostly, tourists, or foreigners who came to live in Korea). The area also seems to have a fairly large African and Middle Eastern community. So Itaewon is your go-to destination for international or fusion cuisine. However, there is one word that describes this neighborhood : ""uneven"". On one hand, Itaewon offers a bustling nightlife, a multicultural environment, and a lot of concept bars or other trendy and completely unexpected establishments. It has become a party center for Korea's nouveau riche and trendy youth. On the other hand, it is sometimes shady, with its poorly lit backstreets, its small stores that sell kitsch/low-brow items, and its tiny low end end restaurants, only meters away from trendy establishments. Also, it lacks the authenticity of Hongdae or even Gangnam. Still, Itaewon probably ranks amongst the Top 3 nightlife districts in Seoul"

70,5.0,"we're from Shanghai and we wanted to buy biggest and tallest size clothes at Seoul. so people taught us to go to the old market Dongdaemoon and Namdaemoon even in Itaewon mall. but we couldnt find it. we felt bad.because the ad was not true. so we were pretty tired to find it and went to the restaurant in Itaewon. Here?!! Somebody told us about the shop when we talked and she explained us how to go to there. Yes!! what we want it??!! we found them at the shop and we were suprised because all of clothes were from UK and Germany plus America. And the clothes were very biggest and tallest size. who had seen the size like a 10 XL in Korea?? There were size large to 10XL. We couldnt believe that but when I put on the cloth, I noticed that it was big. So we bought many clothes there. the shop keepper gave us the german costmetics. we're so happy. because we had got a refund of the VAT of tax in the incheon airport. we had good impression about the shop's name was the Unique Shop and she gave us gifts and Korea gave us to get back to the tax. Thanks and we always remember her kindness. We love you, The Unique shop at the Itaewon."
71,4.0,A lot of halal restaurant make Muslim tourist like me and my friends were enjoy and finally able to eat meat here. I found a Korean Food halal restaurant so you can eat bulgogi with no fear here
72,3.0,"lots of people, shops and restaurants of every kind.the clubs and pubs were kinda fun but all the same ... it was ok .. nothing Great"
73,3.0,"If you're shopping in Itaewon, bargaining is the key. You can find almost everything you need and don't need, from Gangnam socks to tailor-made suits, and if you're a guy, you will be asked at least 5 times if you need a suit. There are a lot of designer knock-offs to peruse bags, wallets, scarves, clothes, etc., but not even quality knock-offs. Itaewon is where the expat community shops and you can definitely see both expats and tourists shopping in this area. There is a vibrant nightlife within the restaurants and bars. I also noticed several US soldiers in the area. If visiting Seoul again, I wouldn't come here. I'd rather shop at Insadong, but if I were living in Seoul as an expat, I can see how I would frequent Itaewon. The one thing that I found in Itaewon that was a pleasant surprise was a pie shop in an alleyway. They had every American pie that you can think of. I had to have the strawberry rhubarb pie. Wasn't as good as I've had back home, but it still tasted nice."
74,3.0,"Too hyped up. This is the sort of place where you just go for the sake of saying ""I've been there"". There are lots of things to see, and plenty of bargains that can be found though. I went and got myself some kebab and greek pita bread. They were awesome. Having said that, unless you're planning to clunbor hang at a bar, for merely shopping there isn't really much to see. You'll see a lot of foreigners here so you won't get much of korean experience"
75,4.0,"Stayed at the Itaewon area for my trip in seoul.  Halal food options aplenty for those with dietary restrictions.  Mosque about 10 minutes from the subway.  Most halal establishment are located at area surrounding the mosque.  Night time area is alive with pubs and bars along the sidewalks. Accommodation is about 5 minutes away from nightlife area and are not affected by the noise.Location is really convenient. No more than 30 mins to most attractions areas like Anguk, Insadong and City hall."
76,5.0,"If u wanna see another place in Seoul u can explore Itaewon , itaewon also have a middle east food , india food, and foreign supermarket also...If u wanna open bank shinhan bank in korea is recommend, all the staff can speaking english.. But for shopping i still recommend ewha university district for cheaper cloth and myeongdong for shopper lover"
77,4.0,"If you don' t speak Chinese & also don't know much of Korean, then Itaewon could be your choice to stay. Tons of fine restaurants alone the street, most of waiters are well-speaking in English.Also,if you like to spend some time for couple of drinks, there's a bar street just behind the Subway exit 2.想體驗首爾的洋風酒吧文化，那就去梨泰院吧！白天從黎泰院到漢南洞一路，有整條林蔭道，兩邊盡是精緻的餐廳，春天跟秋天在戶外座絕對是一大享受；晚上的黎泰院更不寂寞，在漢彌頓飯店後有整條熱鬧的酒吧與餐廳可以讓三五好友喝酒小聚，白天悠閒喝午茶，晚上狂歡喝小酒，就是在黎泰院的寫照。"
78,5.0,"We went to Itaewon in the evening for dinner and desserts at the many cafes down the street. We did our research and found that Maple Tree House (korean BBQ) has awesome grill meat especially their Korean Prime Beef Sirloin. Recommended and ranked on the top of TripAdvisor & we know we can't missed this. (read my blog for more details on directions & pricing) It was one of the best beef Sirlion I ever tasted! Must try if you're in the vicinity. Shopping wise: There's a famous shop that does customised luggage tag at the basement opposite Burger King. It's quite prominent where it displays the unique tags right outside. Be preapred to wait if you're doing a bulk as he makes on the spot. I think tourist should do as he can customised your name into Korean words & choose your fav. logo/cartoon etc. Go check it out!You can read more on the cafes I visited here, http://jacqsowhat.blogspot.sg/2013/08/seoul-korea-day-5-yeouido-hangang-park.html"
79,4.0,"Being new to Seoul, my study abroad group and I ventured as much as we could. Itaewon was definitely one of many places to visit! The area is filled with shopping and food. You could probably find just about any souvenir. The shopping area isn't too big and you could spend hours exploring everything there is too see! Great place to start in Seoul. Highly recommend!"
80,4.0,"Itaewon is the area that easily can be found Halal food. There is lots of restaurants with variety of foods selections i.e. from Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Korea etc..Here also can be found Moslem shops with Halal groceries, hijab clothes, bakery and many more. For Moslem, its so easy to perform prayer hence there is a huge and beautiful mosque/masjid. Combination of modern city with people from different country, language, religion, food...this is Itaewon!"
81,5.0,"Things that i don't really like from Korea is Korean people not really speak English.. But, in Itaewon area, is like expat heaven.. Makes me easy to ask direction ;p .. Lot of restaurant in that area with amazing taste.. if you don't really like Korean food, i recommend TUCAN, Jamaican restaurant. Jerk Chicken in that place so AWESOME!!"
82,5.0,"For moslem, there's no place that so comfortable like itaewon, you can pray here at the seoul center mosque, beautiful mosqe, buy things at halal supermarket, and also eat at a lot of moslem restaurant here, Islamic book store, moslem clothes...anything...Feels like home...."
83,4.0,"Itaewon has long been the place in Seoul where foreigners gather to eat their own cuisine, admittedly with a Korean twist, shop for ingredients for their home cooking and generally just get together with other expatriates.For a long time Itaewon had a rather unsavory reputation, serving as a clubbing scene more than anything else, and the clubs are still there, serving up indie and pop music side-by-side, but recently a renovation has taken place, and upmarket coffee shops, boutique hotels and gourmet restaurants have taken over.The main attraction for me is Itaewon Spa Land, situated on the top of the hill, and reached via a staircase that seems to go on forever! Once at the top, you have the choice of just using the sauna facilities, or having the whole 'jimjilbang' experience, where you get given a floppy set of shorts and T-shirt to wear when entering the communal areas.If you've never experienced a Korean sauna, this is quite a good one to start with. The bath area on the second floor has showers, a massage area, and several pools at different temperatures and with differing herbal infusions in which to soak. There is also a steam room and a sauna. The male and female sections are separate here, but on the third, fourth and fifth floors there are communal areas, including a restaurant, a charcoal oven sauna, massage chairs and TV's, and an exercise area. All this for less than 10000 won makes it real value for money.Once you're scrubbed and clean and relaxed, drop in at the Foreign Market, where you'll find food from Malaysia, India, South Africa, America, Italy and other climes. This is where you can find ingredients that are not in regular Korean shops, such as herbs and spices, semolina flour, oats etc.And of course, finally you can drop in at Turkish, Italian, South African, Greek and many other specialised cuisine restaurants."
84,4.0,I was stationed at Yongsan for 1.5 years. Itaewon is a great party. Plenty of clubs to go to. I Djed at a few of the clubs. Not sure if they are still there but it is a good time for younger people. Will be full of US Military personell and I met people from all over the world. The shopping is good too make sure you haggle a bit as they will all go down in price everytime if you start to walk away.
