0,4.0,"FYI: This is a working fish market...wear sensible shoes (avoid flip flops, high heels and open toe shoes). I have really mixed reviews about this place.  Definitely good to snap a few memorable photos but I don't think the locals like it unless you buy something from their stall.  On the other hand, I also probably ate the best king crab I ever had with my spouse and his buddy. Part of the experience was rather uncomfortable. As soon as we walked in, there were people who started following us, speaking in Mandarin and pressuring to buy the seafood and take upstairs to cook on the second floor.  Probably close to no one there speaks a word of English.  I would also recommend to pay premium and buy something that is alive and swimming, not something that has been sitting on display on a bed of ice as we learned the hard way. The skewer of scallops that was on display on ice ended up hard and chewy.   The live king crab (close to $100 USD) was worth the price even though when you take it upstairs, they charge a cooking fee (we took it to Dragon Palace #17 where lots of people were eating...clearly a good sign)."
1,3.0,"Its a cool place to see, but I wouldnt personally go there again without someone that knows korean. When there, do not only check out the new fish market tho. Also give some time to the old one, which whilst is not as fancy. Its pretty interesting to see, and was for me more fun than the indoors market."
2,1.0,"The fish market is quite big and easy to go by train but we think can skip this place. We have a bad experience and impression of Korea on the second day of our trip. A lot variety of fresh seafood. The price of fresh seafood is ok but of course have to bargain but this is just the beginning. The worker/owner of the seafood stall will keep following and ask us to go to their restaurant. They don't cook seafood the way you want even we told them to. The cooking fees shown on board of the shop - KRW3,000 per person without soup and KRW5,000 per person with soup. Be cautious, they still overcharged us. The amount of seafood we bought is KRW65,000 but the cooking fees we paid is KRW79,000 whereby no soup and just steam all our seafood. How come they steam our oysters. We want to eat it fresh. We also noticed they only serve soup to Korea citizen and no soup to tourist. When we ask how they got the amount charged for cooking fees, they don't even bother to answer us. This really caused a bad impression for Korea tourism. Hope no one will be the next victims like us. Don't visit the restaurant No. 4."
3,4.0,"Her türden deniz canlısının bulunabileceği ilginç bir deniz ürünleri pazarı. Fiyatlar ortalamanın üstünde, fakat görülmesi gerekli bir mekan.Interesting market with any kind of sea product. It is possible only to buy, also it is possible to have them cooked immediately there. However, prices are not so cheap!"
4,1.0,"Never ever left a negative feedback on TripAdvisor but I have to share my experience at the Noryangjin fish marketWe did ask the cooking price in detail before picking this restaurant as one of the restaurant speaks mandarin. We were told 3000 won “sitting” fee for head and 8000 won for cooking king Crab if weight more than one kg. However, we end up being charged 20000 won for each stir fry, 7000 won per kg for king crab and 8000! won each for grilled prawn, 5000 won sitting fee. When we questioned the charging, another staff (who also speaks mandarin) said all the charges are correct and apparently there are 2 types of “sitting” fees.If ordering meals at the fish market, please be cautious. Make sure you have checked the cooking fees per dish beforehand and have the fees written down so there will be no disagreement later."
5,5.0,To see maximum activity you would have to come very early.The place is really huge and the diversity of sea food species is impressive. What a photo safari!My only regret is not having dared a plate of raw fish at 7 am.
6,4.0,"Visited this market very early in the morning, and could view all the different types of fishes on display."
7,5.0,"Highly recommended tour of the “old” AND “new” fish market. Our guide “T” took us on a tour of the fish market and some of the history behind the district. He was VERY personalable and informative. “T” was able to talk and negotiate for the fresh seafood and most important, have them prepare it how you like (traditional) way. If you like seafood, this is a MUST DO when in Seoul!!!  Unlike myself, I didn’t read the whole description of what we would expect would be included when booking... included are:- tour of old and new fish market- options of seafood your group may like to try (additional cost if you want something like lobster or in our case, some abalone and scallops). - choices of preparations of food you chose- ENJOY the food that was alive just minutes ago.Our group had a blast!!! And we are hoping that this tour will gain more popularity with those traveling to Korea (Seoul Hunters)."
8,5.0,"Red tai skin on and off, abalone, cut-live baby octopus, and soup made by the tai head/bones were the dishes we ate!  Always fresh and delicious.  Barely $100 us + $40 for prep at the restaurant (including beers/soju) and meeting tang soup enough for 4 people+.We always come here when we visit seoul."
9,4.0,"I swear to god, If u are seafood lover, this place is the paradise. U can enjoy all sea living animals but the prices are quite expensive. Be aware of not wearing slippers or flip-flop there because of fishy and wet floor, better with boots. U can't ask so many questions due to difficult communication. Bargain is acceptable but not for too much. It's better to go there only if u dare to choose alive sea livings to eat otherwise it's very difficult to make decision to choose. Ahh! I almost forget to review that restaurants in old fish market are poor in hygienic..."
10,4.0,In this market you will be crazy by seeing thousands of fish and other sea animals for sellLike the way they display And prices are so cheap
11,5.0,"This place is a must do in Seoul if you like fish. No Korean required. Here’s how it works. Walk in. Walk around. See what looks good. Don’t stop at the first place that speaks English. Once you settle on something, start talking. It’s all right to point, then gawk, then walk away if you want. If you pick a live fish, they will kill it there. If you want it sashimi style, they will cut it up. Pay for the fish. Then, go with a man who appears from nowhere and takes you upstairs. Don’t ask questions. He will drop you in a restaurant. Tell them how you want the fish cooked. Sit down. Drink. Cooked fish will appear. Eat. Drink some more. Pay as you leave. Thank me later."
12,5.0,"We had a great first time experience at the new wing of the fish market. (Go at dinner time! The restaurants are open until past 10pm.)  Probably because we took our time to shop around and suss out the ""market rate"", at no point did we feel ripped off, unlike some of the reviews. Arrived at 6pm via subway. After asking about 10 vendors, we found a more honest seller (stall 13 near south gate no. 2). She quoted significantly lower prices than the rest, but did not entertain much further haggling. We bought crabs, sea urchins, prawns and octopuses from this lady, and a huge platter of sashimi from the stall next door.A boy guided us to an affiliated restaurant called Hyun Dae. There, the Mandarin speaking lady boss came out and asked us how we'd like each item to be cooked. The cooking fee for each style was clearly stated on the wall, in Korean, so we felt reassured. The seafood came out beautifully steamed, grilled and boiled. The restaurant was full of local diners, including couples on dates, and office workers having after-hours drinks. So it did not feel like a tourist trap. The star dish was something we didn't quite buy from the market stall: my friend copied what she saw on a travel show, and got the restaurant to take the empty crab shells with some roe/cream left inside, and make fried rice with them. (Pictured) Best. Fried. Rice. Ever. I think this is a dish any restaurant at the fishmarket can whip up. So do try it. The restaurant bill, which included cooking fees, booze and side dishes for 3 persons, came up to 67k won. Overall,  we had an amazing dinner,  and would totally do it again if we ever return to Seoul.Directions: To get there from the station, do not take the overhead bridge across the train tracks, as Google will recommend.  Though it works, that route will bring you through a dodgy and foul smelling car park. Instead, go via the underground tunnel. It's newish, brightly lit and smelled fine (for a fish market)."
13,2.0,"I went on a culinary adventure to Noryangjin as some of them wanted to try eating live octopus. The place was easy to find and the market is certainly an interesting place to visit. It’s amazing how much seafood is harvested and eaten by humans :) I feel like we were ripped off though. We purchased a piece of tuna from the fish display and took it to one of the restaurants on the 2nd floor. Many of us think that they might have swapped our tuna for a different piece while it was being cooked. The piece we purchased was very non uniform and the one we received looked just like a well cut piece. This concern aside, the food was ok (not amazing) and the experience won’t be the same in a 2nd visit. IMHO a place for a single visit. Be careful with people and watch your fish as it may be swapped on you too."
14,5.0,I’ve been to many fish markets around the world and I found this one very interesting and photogenic because of its gloomy atmosphere in old building. The saleswomen were nice and not many tourists around. Loved it!
15,1.0,"We bought the seafood at reasonable prices but the cooking was very expensive.  We paid just as much for the cooking as for the seafood.  It costs 8,000krw/kg to bbq...and 15,000krw to stir fry.  We stir fried some items which was measly onions and carrots...What exactly am I paying almost $20 CAD for as we provided the seafood.Complete ripoff, stay away...you can get much better value at the various markets (Namdaemun market, Dongdaemun, etc..)"
16,1.0,"Overpriced especially at the restaurants, charged close to 70k won for cooking 4mini Abalone & steaming 5shellmeat. This is excluding cost of seafood."
17,1.0,"We bought shrimps, abalones, one medium sized crab, clams, a flounder, and a live octopus for W170,000 (3 people).  After negotiating, they took down the price to W150,000 (US$150).  Took the seafood to a cafeteria type of restaurant upstairs which cooked all of the above + 3 Cass beers for W86,000 (US$80).  All the foods were steamed and grilled, but the clams were made into a soup.  All these cookings for W86,000???   The next day, we went to fancy supermarkets and found that the abalones at Galleria and Shinsegae were sold at the same price as the seafood market at W40,000/kg.  What the point of going there if the price is the same as a fancy supermarket???Oh, the shrimps were not even fresh cos it stinks really bad after cooked!Not worth coming!  A tourist-trap, avoid at any cost!!!"
18,3.0,This place was a bit interesting to find. We had to walk through a tunnel that dumped us into an older and newer fish market. We went to the older one to get a look at all of the sea creatures for sale. We were able to order items and get them cooked at restaurants near the market. It was a unique experience and I recommend going for freshly caught/cooked seafood.
19,4.0,"From the metro station, both the active parts of the old fish market and the new modern market building can be easily reached. You can buy and sometimes eat at market stalls, but also visit one of the restaurants in the new market building. This place is open (more or less) 24 hours, but most active in the early morning."
20,1.0,"We (2) bought a sashimi plate for $38. A live big clam and an small octopus for $14. Raw oysters for $5. A dude took us to a mandarin speaker waiter restaurant called Palace Dragon or Dragon Palace. Ordered one soju, stir fried the clam, cut the octopus sashimi style and bbq the oysters. IT CAME OUT FOR MAKING THOSE 3 ITEMS FOR $55!!! Hella expensive and a rip off..and they didn't even gave me a receipt!! TOTAL RIP OFF IN THE RESTAURANT!"
21,5.0,"Went at 5:00 am to see all the live seafood and ended up by picking what we liked, taking it upstairs to the various restaurants, and they cooked it up for us to have for breakfast! We had fish noodle soup, fried rice with roe, oysters in an omelet, steamed flounder, etc. It was really good and though it sounds strange to have all that fresh seafood for breakfast, I am sure you will enjoy it as much as we did!"
22,5.0,It is not far as you can take 2 stops by subway from Seoul station. It is a big fresh fish market that sells everything those can swim. After buying seafood downstairs you are guided to upstairs where there are many restaurants that help tou cook. It costs a little bit more but it is worth as the food is so great. Try king-crab and sashimi!
23,5.0,A must visit if you are a seafood lover. But take note that there are the original old fish market and the new fish market (a newer building) just next to the old one. The price at the old market is definitely much more cheaper (about half price) as compared to the new market. Order whatever seafood u like from the stall and the ahjuma will call their restaurant contact to bring you to have the seafood cook and eat at the restaurant. Walk around to compare the price but majority of them sell the same things and you can bargain abit for better pricing.
24,4.0,"It's smelly, fishy, but if you want a fresh yummy seafood then this is the place to go. It cannot get any fresher. you choose a fish that swims in a big water tank and after 20 minutes the fish you chosen is on the table for you to eat. Big, loud, usually crowded, get there early in the morning for the best deals."
25,5.0,There are many seafood vendors to choose from and restaurants upstairs to cook your food.  There are comments about this place being expensive.  Yes....you are not going to get a live king crab for $50 here.  But it still will be a bargain compared to what you pay in the US.  Also if you are spending some big cash don't be afraid to ask for some free extras for the vendors.   Overall I would highly recommend coming here at least once for the experience and to get some super fresh seafood.
26,3.0,"This place is visited by their locals as well. Take subway to Noryangjin station exit 1. Walk across the bridge and you will come to this open air space/carpark, turn right and walk for another 3 meters. You will see a stairs with some Chinese words scribbled on the wall. 2 floors down and you will see the wet market. Prices are quite competitive. We walked 1 round and decided to settle for one of the stalls with local customers. Some stalls can communicate in Mandarin. 5 pieces of scallops ₩10000, 5 Xlarge prawns ₩10000, 5 small abalone ₩10000, 1 small fish ₩20000, 1 bag clams ₩10000. Simple cooking ie: bbq, steaming, stir fried (clams), pot of soup (fish) costs ₩38000. Whole meal costs us ₩98000 for 2 pax. Price did not include rice or drinks. I would say can come for the experience like witnessing your fish being killed in front of you etc. For cheaper alternative, go for sashimi style like most of the locals. You can't get to choose which shop to cook your food as it's all designated by the stalls."
27,1.0,Be prepared for lots of accosting from the stallholders when you set into the place. The seafood is pricey and bringing it upstairs to the restaurant for sit-in meal is even more pricey. Not worthwhile to pay for the experience. We had better experience at a seafood restaurant in Myeongdong - fresh seafood and better value for $$.
28,5.0,"Highly recommend this place if you are a seafood lover! Totally spoilt for choices here and the price is reasonable! First, you choose a stall and pick your seafood ( you pay for the price of seafood) then the stall owner will ask if you have a preferred restaurant in mind, if not they will recommend. Then they will take you to the restaurant and you can choose how you would like your seafood to be cooked! Steam, bbq, sashimi etc.. and you pay for the price of how it’s being cooked. It’s such an interesting experience for us! Do drop by! And it’s 24 hours!!"
29,5.0,"This is one of the most remarkable and unique experiences of the trip. There, you truly enjoy the Korean experience. A lot of young Koreans go there for dates or just to eat and drink with friends. If you like fresh and good quality seafood this is a total must! There is a metro station in front of the market so it's easy to get there. Note that there are two markets, the old and new one. I recommend to go to the new one since it's cleaner. The main idea here is to buy seafood in the first floor and then go upstairs (2nd floor) and go to a restaurant so they can cook it. There are plenty restaurants that offer the services, in fact I believe they only do that. They charge aprox 5,000 won per person so it's mad cheap. Also, while you are buying seafood sometimes you can find the ""agents"" of the restaurants upstairs so it's easier to talk to them rather than go upstairs without someone that can help you out. We bought: 1 kg of mid size shrimp 1 kg of live large scallops, half a pound of fresh salmon (in Korea you get very good quality salmon, they fly it in every day), 2 live flounders (1.5 kg each) , 1 live seabass (approx 2kg) for a total of 138,000 won (130 dollars). We were 8 people and we were all full. Note that you will have to negotiate always. Try to buy shellfish and fish from one person so they can make a bundle deal. You can deduct btw 10-20% of the starting price. The whole experience was amazing. Way better than see temples and palaces, this was truly Korean"
30,5.0,"Since last october, they moved into a new building next door.  Now 2 levels of seafood stalls and restaurants on the 2nd floor (now majority with tables and chairs vs. Floor seating).  We had rock tai/aji sashimi, abalone, chige with the tai bones...DELICIOUS!  Of course, everything is price negotiable for the seafood so give it a try!"
31,5.0,There are hundreds of vendors selling every kind of live seafood you can imagine. Pick out what you want and they weigh it for you. You can either take it home and prepare it yourself or let them take it upstairs to the restaurant where they prepare it exactly how you want it. You can't get fresher seafood than this!
32,3.0,"Expensive but unique experience. Walked around the market and eventually picked out a large crab. Had the runner bring it to one of the restaurants upstairs where it was steamed. Might not do it again, but as a unique touristy thing to do it was worth the trip."
33,4.0,Very little haggling. Take your time to shop around at the stalls for the best deal. Stay with your purchase until it gets to the restaurant. Use google translate as the restaurant owners are limited on English.
34,5.0,"Went there with some friends, including a local. This is essential if you want to experience the thing fully. We bought fish and had it cooked (some) in a top floor restaurant. Was great."
35,1.0,Not the first time here. Did it to re-experience from 3 years ago at the old market.Bought a large lobster & crab for $200.Then the restaurant (named Hwang Jae) charged me $60 to steam them.  $60??? WTF? Never again.The lobster was over cooked and the crab was way too salty.
36,3.0,"It's a great place with lots of options. Kind of far,  if you don't have a car. However, you can find cabs riding down the highway."
37,3.0,"A huge variety of fresh seafood. Interesting to see a fresh sea worm, red clam/coral. Abalone is a much And it's really delicious. Friendly vendors with very competitive pricing. No need to really bargain but no harm asking, we had free prawns."
38,3.0,"Warning! Bad English! The market is very close to Noryangjin MRT station. Walk out of exit 1 and you will find a bridge on your left. Cross the bridge and you will find the old market, so keep walking until you see the new building. If you want to eat, go to the second floor, there are almost 20 restaurants but they seem to sell the same food. One rule that you need to know is you have to bring your own raw seafood! People buy them from the first floor and bring to the restaurants. The standard seating charge is 3,000 won for one person which include fresh vegetables and dipping sauce. They will charge you for cooking but I did not remember the rates (standard rates for most restaurants). I bought only one tray of sashimi, no raw food for cooking so they charged me 5,000 won/person instead of 3,000 won!!!They have basic menus like fish bone soup that you won't need to have your own materials. I ordered one pot of soup and it costs around 10,000-15,000 won. In total I paid 25,000 won for the soup, two bowls of rice and seating for two people. Most restaurants, guests sit on mats with shoes off just like traditional Korean style."
39,4.0,Bargain bargain and bargain! That's the rule in all markets.  No need to feel shy :)Nice seafood but always in seafood price.
40,4.0,"4 of us ordered king crab 2.3kg with the price of 115k and plate of sashimi 20k, the owner bonus 3 pices of orange shell (dont know what it is) and 4 abalone cost us 10k. The owner helps us to discount on cooking restaurant. The female king crab meat is a bit soft not good as male king crab (more expensive)."
41,2.0,"We went with my friend last April 16, 2017 around noon. I agree, the seafood's are fresh and almost all stall have the same price. The second floor was closed like some abandoned facilities (kind of scary) and trash was still inside. We tried looking for a restaurant outside the market and found one.  If you are looking for some market experience then this will be okay but if you want to eat live octopus, there are decent restaurants that offer that menu."
42,5.0,"Noryangjin fish market is the largest and most popular seafood market in Seoul. You can buy other kinds of fresh seafood that are fresher at Noryangjin Fish Market at very low prices. The most common seafood sold are clams, king crab, abalone, shrimp, sting ray, sea cucumber, octopus, halibut, giant lobsters, eel, sea bass, snappers, sea urchins, salmon, and tuna...After buying your fish or seafood someone will direct you to a nearby partner restaurant, where you can find sit-in restaurants, they will cook and then serve them as a meal to you with due the separate fee you have to pay for condiments and cooking methods. How to Get there? : Getting to Noryangjing Fish Market is easy! If taking the Seoul metro, get off on the Noryangjin station (Line 1/Blue Line). TGo up the stairs and go straight to Exit 1 (look for signs for the Fish Market) and follow signs to a stairway leading down to ground level and from there you can enter the warehouse.*Note : Pay in cash! They do not accept you pay with credit cards."
43,5.0,Great place to eat the freshest seafood!  You can eat sashimi of great quality and quantity IF you negotiate hard!
44,5.0,"Although this place have a very strong seafood smell (like a typical Singapore wet market) but it is a must visit place for seafood lover when you visit Korea. All the seafood here are very fresh and after you bought the seafood from the store, the restaurant staff will guide you to their restaurant and they will cook the seafoods for you! 🦀🦑🐙🐟🦐"
45,5.0,We went here twice during a Seoul visit. The first time we bought some large prawns and abalone which we then had cooked for us in one of the restaurants upstairs.The second time we went all out for a huge snow crab with a big plate of sashimi. It was cooked and prepared for us upstairs. We ate in many places while we were in Seoul including Michelin star food but this was the best meal of the week!Well worth a visit even if you are not planning to eat but do eat if you have time - it is a great experience. You obviously pay for the fish and you then pay for the restaurant to cook it. I am not sure how this really works out but we paid about 25.000 won for it both times (plus drinks) for the whole party.
46,5.0,"Vin Merlot, Mrs Merlot and son young Merlot travelled by subway to this market for the experience. Vin hails from a long line of fishmongers, having started at the Melbourne fish market when he was 7 years old helping Papa Merlot.The great advantage of this market is that whatever you choose to purchase you can take upstairs to be cooked for you in one of the many restaurants. We arrived about 10am which was a non busy time with many vendors and restaurants having a mid morning break but still serving.The women vendors were dressed in pink aprons. We witnessed the full range of sales techniques from friendly and helpful, to a little forward but with good humour to plain pushy and no humour!!We weren't hungary but bought half kilo of prawns to have them cooked upstairs. I am surprised by some of the TAs views that it was expensive. Half kilo of good size prawns 14000Kwon (approx $AUD  14). Cooking price with green tea for three, plus condiments 16,000 Kwon (approx $AUD 16). We thought that was fair plus restaurant staff very helpful, despite little English but they somehow twigged we were ""kangaroo"".Then went back downstairs to the old market part to return to a fishmonger who had been helpful in explaining his products in limited English. Needless to say he was delighted and probably surprised to see us but we bought a large plate of sashimi 20,000 Kwon (approx $AUD  20) and a fillet of salmon a bit more than half a kilo for 20,000 Kwon all of which 4 of us have eaten tonight.Perhaps pick your time and we're closed shoes and you will have great time. A stroll down memory lane for Vin, highly recommended and a vwobderful experience!"
47,3.0,Go with a local and let him/her do the talking. They will tell you different more expensive pricing when they realize you are a tourist. You choose what seafood you want and they will take you to a restaurant where they'll cook what you chose at the market. It is interesting for a first visit but I wouldn't go again.The floors of the market are all slippery and wet so careful with your choice of shoes.
48,5.0,It's very big fisheries market in Seoul. Very convenience to visit by subway. There are 2 buildings (Old and New) and some items are different. It's better to visit the New Building first and go to 2nd Floor to meet visit the prospected restaurant and ask the staff or chef to go with you to select the items. He/ she can recommend you what kind of menu that suitable for each one.
49,3.0,"Nice fish market to walk around and seafood is fresh. But the restaurants on the second floor is quite pricy. 3000won to get seated per person and 10,000-15000 to cook a dish. Feels like a tourist trap as it standa"
50,4.0,"Great fish market consists of two parts old and new in a modern space. Do not hesitate to choose the live fish, which will bring in a restaurant. I suggest you should try the live small octopus. Enjoy the fresh raw fish."
51,5.0,"PRICE: We went to the old fish market (right next to the new fish market) b/c that's where it seemed like most of the locals were going. The only issue is that you have to speak Korean/Chinese in order to bargain properly in that environment. The prices are very fluid and rather than decrease the price of the seafood that you want, it seems more effective to try to get more of each item given a certain price (ie. 4 octopus for 10,000W rather than 3 octopus). Despite probably being overcharged (b/c we're very obviously foreigners with our cameras and all), the pricing was decent.QUALITY: All the seafood at the market is very fresh and pretty good quality. I personally think everyone should try the live octopus and the tuna. If you go early enough and ask around, you can get them to cut out a fresh portion of the entire tuna belly for a decent price (maybe 50,000W?).RESTAURANT: We originally went to a restaurant deep in the old fish market on the first floor, but the lady was very aggressive and wanted to overcharge us (3000W per person for seating and side dishes + 20,000W to cook the food after a lot of bargaining [we didn't buy that much food, plus the lady at the entrance of the market that we spoke to told us that she wasn't going to charge us for sashimi, so we could always go back to her as a fall-back plan]), so we left. Instead we went to a restaurant on the second floor (the middle of the market) which immediately charged us 27,000W to prepare all of the food for us (no bargaining needed!). Furthermore, the second floor restaurant was a lot cleaner and had a better overall ambience, so we went with the restaurant on the second floor."
52,4.0,It was an eye opener to see such wide varieties of seafood. You can choose from over 50 stalls. Most of them can speak mandarin but not so much on English.  Of course cooking of the seafood will be additional cost. I would recommend going to the old market as it has a traditional fish market feel.
53,5.0,Noryangjin Fish market is a must go place for me. Every time I go to Korea I must bring my friend and my family to there and eat seafood. I like this place because you can choose seafood on the first floor and ask people there to cook it for you. Also there are people that they can speak Chinese so there is no problem for communicating how the seafood are being cooked. I think the price is not very expensive (middle price) and the taste of the seafood is very fresh. Until now I can still remember the taste of those seafood which make me want to go visit in the near future.At last I would like to recommend you check carefully for the location because it is quite hard to find that place if you are not well prepared.
54,4.0,"A seafood paradise and not a place to meet if you are a seafood lover. Everything from Alaskan king crabs, prawns, scallops, etc are either alive or super fresh. A must visit!!"
55,4.0,"Went there 2 years before at the old market which was pretty dark and wet. Heard that a new market was opened in April and we decided to give it a try again.The new building was bright and spacious but most of the vendors there were Chinese which was good for us because we came from Hong Kong. After a good bargaining on seafood, we went upstairs and entered a restaurant that had most customers. We had King crab, abalone, sushi and octopus/fish soup. Everything was very tasteful and the price was far too good compared with Hong Kong."
56,4.0,"The market is full of all kind of seafood such as crabs; huge crabs, flounders, other fish, octopus....It is a huge market.  You can  buy fish,  or any kind of seafood and have them cook upstairs in any restaurant for a certain price.It is a little expensive I think and even to have it cook.It is one time experience..."
57,3.0,"There was an old and a new fish market. Went to both and opted to buy seafood at the old one. We just followed our guts and purchase our fresh seafood. After that, we were led to a restaurant and they prepared the food. It was a good experience especially with the live octopus (sanakji)."
58,4.0,"I came here once before the new wing is built. After reading the reviews from Trip advisor about the new wing, we decide to explore this. The new wing is further up the old wing of the market. Once you walk through the old market, you will see a new painted building( 2 storey tall). When we are there, not all the stalls are occupied. I guessed some of the old wing stalls have not moved to the nee wing of the seafood market. We decided to follow the Local Korean crowd. Though it was a Sunday afternoon, many locals are here to buy their seafood. We walked towards where most of them are congregated and start checking out the live seafood. There are no pricing listed on the seafood tank. So the best way is to dish out your calculator and start asking The price and punching the numbers. For those whom are new to this manner of ordering. Please note. 1. Order your fresh seafood from the stall at level 1/ basement. 2. If you want to have it cook and eat on the spot, the restaurants are on the second floor. The pricing for cooking is another additional cost. Some of it does by the weight. You may ask them to lower the cost of the dish is simple to cook. Example. We order the abalone and wanted it cook as porridge. The abalone is the cost we paid to the live seafood stall by kg. We also have to pay the Restuarant for the cooking cost - it comes out to 5000won per kg. 3. Other miscellaneous cost are the towels, small dishes and drink. There will be a runner that will bring you and your seafood to the Restuarant designated. I love my seafood steam, boiled and grilled. So I didn't make it complicated. As the runner is from China, we spoke in Mandarin and he gave the precise ways  on how our seafood are cooked. We ordered the crab, large cockles and abalones We have very enjoyable meal there as our Neighbour diner whom are Korean were sharing their sashimi with us and trying to communicate with us in his  simple English. I recommend only those who love seafood to visit this place. Just not be frustrated but do some simple calculation before you confirm your order in bulk."
59,2.0,"The fish market is pretty huge, with all of the stalls selling close to the same items. It is difficult to decide who to purchase from so make sure you take your time surveying before deciding. We made the mistake of not doing that and just buying from a random ahjumma. She had promised to sell us an octopus + a slab of salmon for 24,000w but however after catching the octopus, she changed it to 29,000w. We refused but she just got angry and shoved the octopus at us then proceeded to tell us to pay and leave. While my friend and I were discussing on what to do, she rudely told us to speak in mandarin (she could speak in korean and mandarin). The both of us decided to go with it because we didn't want to create a scene. So then this other ahjumma brought us to her restaurant in the 2nd floor. All she did was to provide us some cutleries, sauces, kimchi and cut our octopus for us. We were charged 10,000w for that. Definitely the most unpleasant dining experience we had in Korea. However the salmon and octopus were really fresh so that is worth noting. If you visit, be careful!!"
60,5.0,"Tons of stalls with all kinds of fish.  A good portion of the fish and shellfish are alive in tanks...Clams, anilines, snapper, flounder, tilapia, octipus, crab, lobster, eel to name some.  Huge prawns. You can buy it and get it cooked upstairs.  We don't speak Korean so this may be easier said than done.  But if you want fresh seafood...this is the place to go!!!"
61,5.0,"Fresh seafood at reasonable price . We picked our sole fish, shells, octopus, and fresh abalone (!) And then we eat them at a restaurant upstairs. The sole fish wqs eaten raw like sashimi. The rest were put into a hot boiling soup. WOW.  Everything tastes really good but it was really The abalone that absolutely made an impression ."
62,3.0,"Went to Noryangjin Fish market for lunch. My first impression was there are a lot of stalls selling the same stuff and can get pushy at times. Had a problem deciding which to go for to choose the seafood to eat. Anyway after randomly selecting a seller she got what we wanted, a king crab, scallops and prawns for the 2 of us. After weighing price was 68000 krw. Brought us up a floor to the restaurant to cook and after we agreed in the style of cooking we waited patiently for the food. Very simple style, steamed and bbq, plus a fried rice at the end with what's left of the king crab. Damage was another 48000 which we though was high given the little work and ingredients added. Ok, the crab was very good, fresh and sweet so at the end of the day, it was worth it. Would I go again...Yes for the king crab."
63,2.0,Old and dirty fish market. Was in 10 minutes ready. Hard sell market place owners. Not particularly worth the visit. The signs to the market was odd. You have to take the higher bridge to get there. During the afternoon most of the stalls were closed.
64,3.0,"It's a cool experience to walk around and choose fresh seafood, but all the sellers are quite aggressive and come up very close to try and get you to buy their stock. to the point where we were too scared to stop and actually look at anything closely because they were so pushy. There are two parts, one in the older more traditional fish market type and the other side is newer and looks slightly cleaner. I went with a local friend, and even she wasn't so happy with the experience. I don't know what I would have done without a local, but somehow we managed to order something and ate at the restaurant side, which is a bit of a walk away."
65,4.0,"Was there in early June 16 and they're expanding to a large more modern building next door but activity at the original is still very much there.  Group of three and wandered for a while and settled on the live octopus with large sashimi platter from a vendor.  The octopus was wrapped in a bag with sea water and we were escorted to a small restaurant where the octopus was chopped up and the huge sashimi platter was delivered.  Not cheap but not really expensive.  From our picked vendor had choices of 30-40-50,000 won sashimi platters and we took the most expensive because we were givin a bonus plate with more fish and sea creatures.  All said and done about 60,000 won (~$50 USD) for an incredible amount of fresh fish.  Finished it all, luckily my korean friend is a competitive eater :)"
66,3.0,"There is a new building new to the market, some of the staffs said they are about to move-in but still under some touch-up. We have been searching in the old market for 30mins, bargain is only for one lost cost fish but not like big crab and lobster. You may be able to spend the same money if you are dinning in a proper restaurant or even hotel."
67,3.0,"The market is now in its third location over the years -- this latest iteration is new, spacious, sanitary, and (until Noryangjin Station finishes its renovations) a bit hard-to-find.    Some sidewalk stickers guided us the roundabout route.  The old decrepit buildings are apparent nearby.  The new version is a bit sanitized--not much worry about getting dirty at all.  When we went, Thursday lunchtime, it seemed rather empty.  But the variety and freshness of seafood is apparent, really a good place for a seafood lover.  Lots of restaurants upstairs will cook your fish to taste; in a slow period (as with us), they may even take pity on a clueless foreigner and walk down with you to the stalls and help you order your king crab and octopus and anything else.  The crab was expensive but stunning (YOLO).  The raw octopus is indeed weird but palatable--literally sticks to the roof of your mouth!   Note: if anybody in the group does not like seafood or the sight of fish being gutted, go somewhere else that day.  Note also that there's not much English spoken, but they are very friendly and helpful.  I wish the government would spend some effort on tourism support there."
68,4.0,"An amazing collection of seafood stalls under one roof. Fresh fish and shellfish as well as iced. The procedure is this:1) bring friends if you are eating at the market2) find a local person to help you. Most Koreans will be more than happy to assist you3) decide on fresh or iced. Iced fish is great for soup or barbecue and much cheaper than fresh. 4) order about 1kg per person for shellfish for soup. Remember, your eyes are bigger than your stomach. 5) negotiate and make the purchase. Take the fish to the second floor of the new building next door. The table fees are about 3000 and the cooking charge about 10000-20000 depending on how much fish and whether it's soup of just steaming."
69,3.0,"Went there for the first time , heard good reviews from friends . There's many stores selling seafood. To Ensure your seafood is fresh , do only order the live seafood and those seasonal seafood which the prices are cheaper .Do not order those frozen prawns , clams , as these aren't fresh at all , and we didn't finish those seafood , very disappointing . Do bargain hard too , and ask many stores for prices quotation first before deciding . For the cooking , we had to pay 3000 won for the table service . On top of this , we order fish , abalone , prawn , all these individually dishes are charged separately . There's more charges depending on the type of seafood . The crab is in season now , do order the crab . Is this a must visit ? Compared to the Tokyo fish market , I still prefer the Tokyo fish market which is more authentic. This market is filled with many Chinese stalls and prices quoted for some stalls are extortion."
70,4.0,"An interesting place. In the process of moving into a new building that is a little more clean and hygienic looking, but take time to walk through the old market. A little Squeamish for those not used to, or willing to accept that this is about providing food and not a home fish tank for gold fish!Some fish were upside down and not swimming any more, but the overall feeling is that things are fresh as they are alive. Great topic for discussion with children about the food chain, and the spider crabs trying to escape.One of those places where you come away not really knowing how to feel, but also gives some insights into how people live and work in this environment and the surrounding street stalls of vegetables and more fish, but dried this time. A good hour spent."
71,4.0,"Noryangin is one of the Korea's largest seafood market.We can buy various fresh seafood in the first floor. We can ask the seller to slice the fish for eating as a sashimi.At that time, we only bought the fish and went to the restaurant on the 2nd floor. We requested the restaurant to make fish stew for us and we need to pay 19,000 won for 3 person. It's quite pricey😓, but it's tasted good"
72,3.0,"Was an ok experience, but would not come back again. Would have been better if we knew someone Korean to show us around and help haggle lol. Kind of knew we were being overpriced since we were tourists. Being Vietnamese, we were automatically thought of as Chinese tourists, and by the reactions of the people around us, I guess we were given a different (poorer) service at the restaurant after buying our fish."
73,5.0,"Came here w/korean friends, sought out a fish that we liked, got that fish executed and turned into sashimi quite fast right in front of our eyes and went upstairs to eat it like the locals do. Cool atmosphere, plenty to see and eat. I recommend tagging along with someone who speaks korean.. or at least learn how to speak ""shopping""korean before you visit."
74,4.0,"My friend and I really love seafood so, we wanted to visit the fish market and have fresh seafood.  The market is quite easy to get to.  Just take subway Line 9 to Norayngjin station, walk up to the exit and to the overpass.  I actually could smell grilled fish from there.  From the overpass, there was a sign that point to the right and to fish market.  Once across, turn left and go down the stair.  On the second floor balcony, you can see all the market areas with stalls full of seafood.Down stair, we browsed around to see what they had to offer.  The variety of the seafood was incredible.  There were so many things that we had never seen before or didn't realize that they were edible.There was only two of us so, we couldn't have many dishes.  We settled with fresh oyster, assorted fish sashimi and grilled fish.  We bought oyster and sashimi from one stall and fresh whole fish from another stall.  Then, the stall owner had his staff took us to a restaurant (more like a cooking tent) along the side of the market.  There, they prepared food for us and we ate there.  We paid them for the service and beverage.  The seafood was really fresh and delicious.  Try having sashimi and oyster with Korean chilli sauce.  It was delicious!"
75,5.0,"I was really impressed by the range and variety of seafood at the wholesale market. They're not only fresh but also cheap too. However the downside is that the restaurants actually charge quite an amount of fee to cook your seafood selections. A must-try would be sea urchins and abalone, which tasted really, really sweet and fresh!The wholesale market is located within a walking distance from Noryangjin station."
76,4.0,"Huge market, fresh products (but not everything). We can find lots of differents seafood, you can buy and ask them to cook for you but the service charge is not cheap. Have to try once if you visit Seoul."
77,4.0,"Second time visiting this place, amazed one more time. The prices of this place are not cheap (maybe because we are foreigners they over priced) but the quality of the food is good and you are totally sure is fresh. Hundreds of shops to choose from shrimps until puffer fish (yes!puffer fish and they have specialized chef to cook it). The must is the octopus sashimi (live octopus... well choped octopus that still moving). No need to visit early morning, all the fish are alive so anytime you go the product will be fresh. Amazing place to live the experience and enjoy a tasty lunch."
78,3.0,Lots of stalls selling mostly the same food. Jus choose which ever stall u like. Food is fresh but quite expensive.
79,4.0,"Noryangin in Seoul is well-known for three reasons first the fish market, then the institute, and last the street food. People here are divided into 2 categories.First, there people are visit the fish market. They eat or buy fresh seafood from the fish market. The fish market is a very big in Noryangin.The other people are the students. They are people from all over the country who come to Noryangin to study. There are many famous educational institutes in Noryangin. Their purpose for coming to Noryangin is to go to college and start their careers. People in Noryangin have little money. So many street food shops was born. Their food is delicious and cheap."
80,5.0,"This place is a blast to visit. Your dinner will be alive one minute, and on your plate (possibly still wriggling) the next. After negotiating the price of your fresh catch, head to one of the packed dungeon-like dining areas where the fish will be prepared for you. Best enjoyed alongside cold beer and sake with friends. Sashimi a must."
81,5.0,"If you're into seafood, this is a place to see. They have all types seafood. If you are going to buy anything its best if you know a little Korean."
82,2.0,"It was very interesting to tour the market, to see a huge variety of live sea foods.However, please just enjoy the tour but DO NOT buy the seafood NOR eat at a restaurant upstairs. They just wanted to rip off tourists, and overcharged a lot.Please be warned."
83,5.0,"It was my 1st visit to this famous market and it was absolutely worth it! The smells, the mindboggling number of stalls selling practically the same stuff. You just need to pick a stall, pick your seafood & bargain for what it's worth. Then someone will lead the way to a restaurant on the 2nd level where they will cook the chosen seafood anyway u want. Need to pay the restaurant service charges for the cooking & the side dishes, each person will be about S$5-$8. We chose live octopus, salmon sashimi, abalones (small, sold in set of 3 for KRW10,000) long legged crab & a plate of oysters, all for KRW50,000....a real steal!"
84,4.0,"Wander around the fish stalls and make your selection from an amazing array of choices. Then head up one floor and hand it over to any of the restaurants on that level. They will seat you, offer you side dishes and beverages and prepare your food for you. We had salmon sushi and steamed crab. We will add this place to our favorites in Seoul."
85,4.0,"Came here around 3am and there were crowds of people from local businesses participating in the daily seafood auctions. Although I didn't speak their language, I thought this was fascinating especially watching the octopus trying to escape their tanks or picking up the seafood for a candid shot. The fish market is housed inside this large warehouse like building with several stands aligned next to each other. The key is to bargain and make sure you ask around at a couple stands before making a purchase. I eventually bought 2 large crabs, and 10 shrimps for around $30 USD which is equivalent to ~40000 WON. When I asked the host at my hostel, he claims it was a bargain so I'll take his word for it. Once I made the purchase, they have kitchens within the compound that would help you cook your seafood to your preference for additional fees of course. I opted for steamed crab and shrimp for I love the nature sweetness from these fresh cooked crustaceans. Another thing to keep in mind, DO NOT WEAR flip flops or TOMs if you don't want your feet smelling like fish water."
86,4.0,"Noryangjin Fish Market offers great live seafood and a nice contrast to the more famous Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo. While Tokyo's fish market is older and sushi is more connected to international image of Japanese cuisine, Noryangjin in Seoul is a more ""hands-on"" experience. The aisles are wider than those in Tokyo's Tsukiji, and there's not as much worker traffic in the tourist area (which can actually be dangerous in Tsuiji, perhaps part of its appeal; Noryangjin seemed safer/more orderly). Balconies offer photographers good overhead shot opportunities and store offerings are arranged most photogenically.Also, there's no 3am wait to watch the fish auction as in Tokyo... here, you bargain yourself! Beware to foreigners: even if you speak Korean, you're going to pay a higher price than locals who are willing to bargain, and the store clerks, some of whom seemed to not be locals (based on accent and appearance, though I could be wrong), are completely unabashed about charging foreigners the higher prices. Go with a local friend if at all possible. There were three in my group, and we ended up paying more than 100,000KRW for a delicious meal, but I felt as if I could have gotten the same for much cheaper elsewhere in Seoul, a city known for its affordable food. We assumed we ""paid for the experience.""Noryangjin Fish Market is easily accessible by subway, bus or taxi. I used Noryangjin Station on subway Line 1 to arrive."
87,5.0,"If you've never been to a seafood market, you have got to see this one.  I saw seafood there that I've never seen before.  And so much of it.  It went on and on.I swear I saw shrimp as large as lobsters.  We bought some fresh scallops, abalone, shrimp, and octopus.  Took them to a restaurant right next store. And had them cooked, except for the octopus which we ate live."
88,5.0,"Tremendous experience.  Never seen something like this before.  Rows of vendors.  Purchase fresh, walk down to the bowels of the market to a restaurant - and handover your bag of fish - and just wait.  Good comes out ready to eat.  What a great experience!   Must do!!"
89,3.0,Fish market next to a seafood restaurant... Means you buy they cook and you eat there. The fish monger speaks Mandarin so it helps a lot if you know Chinese. it was good should try if you have time in Korea
90,5.0,"Love how this place has the freshest and most varieties of seafood!  Affordable and yummy.  Pick your seafood and take them to the restaurants where they will handle the cooking,  provide you with a decent place to dine along with drinks to complete your meal.  Thumbs up! !"
91,4.0,"We went at night and it is deigned for tourist. Still there are plenty of locals around.Be very careful if you have selected which restaurant to cook your dish. I was lead to a different restaurant.If you are not an expert, there are two type of King crabs. Know which one to buy."
92,4.0,"This place is not just a seafood place, you can also find some preserved vegetables stalls along the way.Basically most of the stall sell almost the same thing, you choose the stuff you want to try and buy then find a place to cook for you (all the restaurant there will cook for you will a lot of service fee, just sitting in will cost you at least 3,000won, so prepare a lot of cash when you visit here).. Do not worry if you can't understand Koreans, most of them speak Mandarin too, not too much of English, which is a down point. Spot a friendly seller and ask her/him about the seafood before you buy."
93,5.0,"You really shouldn't miss the opportunity to roam around this crazy market and eat some super fresh seafood.  It is definitely not a tourist trap, but it can be quite intimidating.  We walked around and took photos for about an hour trying to figure out what to do and how to do it.  We wanted to get food and have it cooked, but we didn't see any restaurants or stalls cooking food and wasn't sure how it worked.  After exploring a bit more, we found a lot of restaurants hidden on the 2nd floor.  The trick is...find your restaurant first!  Take a look at which place is busiest and the atmosphere you want.  Then go down to get your seafood.  Some of the stall owners will try to refer you to a friend they have who runs a restaurant, but that felt kinda shady.  Our restaurant let us choose how we wanted each thing cooked and it was all delicious.  They don't charge anything for sashimi which was awesome for  salmon and the octopus that we carried around in a bag while still alive.  It was still squirming when we ate it!!  Overall, it takes a bit of work to make it all happen but it's so worth it and such a great story/experience."
94,4.0,"We took the subway from Bukchon Village and alighted at the Noryangjin subway station. From there we met up with a local friend and walked to Noryangjin Fish Market. It was just a less than 10 minute walk away from the station. Coincidentally, this visit to Noryangjin Fish Market was also the first for our local first. Even though she is Korean and lives in Seoul, she told us that she has not yet visited the market before! So she did a lot of research and managed to find us a good restaurant.I can’t remember which stall it was because the moment we entered the market, it was a flurry of fishy displays and vendors promoting their wares. The experience can be a little overwhelming with the (somewhat) touting and large area of the market. But thankfully we just followed our friend, who was busy picking out the fish for our supper while we we gawking at seafood that surrounded us.Before entering the restaurant, we had to remove our shoes and place them in a shoe bag that was provided to us. After which we carried the shoe bag with us to our table. The restaurant was bustling with activity: it was a Friday night so it was packed with a lot of people who were there after work or school treating themselves to a seafood feast to usher in the weekend. The table next to us was a group of high school girls in their uniforms eating a delicious looking crab stew and playing games.It took less than 15 minutes for our food to arrive, because it was (mostly) sashimi (raw) style! There was fresh salmon, scallop, cooked prawns and 2 other types of fish (which I have no idea what they were but still delicious nonetheless). The pieces of fish were fresh and did not have any strong fishy smell. Eaten together with the soya sauce and wasabi, it was sashimi heaven! The wasabi was not as spicy as the Japanese type and complimented well with the pieces of fish and soya sauce, perfect for those wanting to venture into a spicy adventure but afraid of the fieriness. There were even corn kibbles as a side (a bonus).For more on my fishhful experience and photos, please check out my blog: http://www.travelbytez.com/2015/05/supper-at-noryangjin-fish-market.html"
95,5.0,"At the advice of many Trip Advisors, we wanted to start the day by having breakfast at the Noryangjin Fish Market. After spending a good 30 minutes toying around with Google Maps, we learned that the full features of the app does not work in South Korea. With a little guesswork and hand signals with strangers at the train platform, we hopped on the train and prayed that it would take us in the right direction.Thankfully we got there and I was in absolute awe at the massive size of the fish market and its colorfulness. It was vibrant and vivid – a little musky – but it was so cool to see the market in action. I was like a kid in a candy store. I thought to myself, “this is it. I am doing this. I am going to eat truly fresh sea food.” With my eyes wide open with excitement I quickly paced myself towards the vendor, which quickly ended, when a tiny Asian woman bludgeoned a fish for a customer right in front of me. I immediately grabbed my partner and best friend’s hand and dragged them out of the warehouse. There was no way I could have stomached it that early in the morning.P.S. Yes, I returned before leaving Korea to accomplish my mission."
96,1.0,"TOURIST TRAP. We went during a weekday (mid morning). MUST: wear shoes while visiting! As expected of fish market - there is a lot of water on the ground. I saw lots of shows highlighting this market as variety and lots of stalls. This was true. However, buyer beware! We went to a stall owned by Chinese - they ""recommended"" a restaurant that would prepare the seafood we had just purchased. When we sat down, our seafood was NOT fresh. They brought out our sashimi that we saw them cut outside in already packaged (4 layers of saran wrap). What we suspected is that they swapped our ""live"" seafood for already prepared or not as fresh/big seafood they had inside the restaurant. We all had stomach problems after our meal. Not only that, but they charged us a hefty sum for a lot of the ""prep"" work and added on additional fees they didnt forewarn us about. Stay away! Not worth travel time! If you do go - don't make the same mistake we did!"
97,4.0,"Really worth a visit. The market is very big and they sell 'everything' you can imagine. Wear proper shoes as it's very wet on the floor. You can choose your food and bring it to one of the restaurants in second floor who will, for a small fee, prepare it for you. Prices are reasonable."
98,4.0,"Get to enjoy the sights and food the market has to offer.  Was there with some Korean friends which was much easier in terms of communication. Although the fish mongers seems to be able to speak some English and some could even speak in Mandarin which is what I found in this trip is quite the norm.  There were lots of seafood available some for me was a first - eating fresh squirt shellfish, sea cucumber besides the usual sashimi.  However I draw the line on trying fresh octopus or urchin.  What we chose were cooked by a restaurant nearby.  We had prawns, snow crab, abalone, fish and finale was a hot spicy soup made from the bones of the fish, the shell of the snow crab was taken back to the kitchen where a special steam rice was made with the juice of the crab.  Simply amazing meal! so so yummy ;-)"
99,3.0,"Noryangjin, Seoul's fish market, has all the charms of a traditional market: bustling, run down, Noisy, full of colorful stands... Amazing place for pictures. One of Noryangjin's big draw is that you can actually buy a fish and have it cooked upstairs in restaurants on the second floor of the building. Truly delicious. So if you life fish or seafood, you'll be in paradise. If you're just visiting, you might not have the same experience. Noryangjin is being rebuilt and the current (old) Noryangjin has been partly deconstructed in the process and is not as big as it used to be. There is also little else to do besides actually looking, buying or eating fish, so if you're not into eating fish, you might be underwhelmed."
100,4.0,"This was a super cool experience, given the size and breadth of the fish inventory.  All the fish were alive and the mongers were fun to interact with.  I would rate this an ""Excellent"" if I felt that we weren't being overcharged for being foreigners.  My friend is Korean and led the negotiation, but I still felt like we didn't get the greatest deal. As a whole, that's OK because of how impressive and cool the collection of fresh fish were.My friend even make a reservation at a nearby spot that took our fresh fish/shellfish and make an awesome meal that finished with an INSANE soup of the leftovers.  Awesome night!"
101,4.0,"Great place for seafood lovers.  We've read a lot of reviews and most do warn people that they charge a ""tourist"" price for any non locals.  We just depended on our luck, cause we have no idea what the fair price would be.  We went to two different stalls.  The first stall we came across, we picked out long legged crab and a huge shrimp for 20,000 won.  It was really good. So good!Then we wanted to tried other stuff, we walk along and stop at a random stall, the store keeper ask the guy who was able to speak mandarin to communicate with us...I think he over charged us.  And we bought 4 abalones but when the restaurant cooked it, they said there were only 3 in the bag. We also bought fish for hoe, which he said this type of  fish is only available in Korea, so we tried that as well, I can't remember exactly how much he charged but we felt we were overcharge for that fish. I guess it's better to bring a local friend with you so you don't get cheated. But if you don't know anybody there and really want to try, just try your luck and maybe you'll meet an honest stall keeper or you just have to be ready to fork out whatever the ""tourist"" price is."
102,4.0,"Interesting place to visit. It is so huge that you do not have to walk the whole market as most of the stalls sell the same similar seafood. But you will be able to see a wide assortment of seafood available, probably see many of them for the first time. Tried the alaskan king crab, squid and abalone cooked at a restaurant after buying the items. Just for the experience.  My recommendation, unless you understand the Korean language or is there with someone who does just enjoy the experience of the place and the hustle and bustle, If you buy, your really do not know the price of the item, you can look at the scale but they speak native Korean and smile a lot, so you really do not know. And you may get a crab that is alive but barely, so again you not get the freshest. After my meal, I realized that it was a great experience but I can get it cheaper and cooked much tastier back home.  And I don't have to do this again.  But for the experience, try it once."
103,5.0,"My friends and I were visiting Seoul, and we had a local friend who took us to dinner at the fish market.  The whole experience was simply amazing.  We got to the market, picked out giant shrimp/crabs/octopus, and a bunch of fish.  The market lady sashimi-ed the fish in front of us, and gave us giant platters of it to take away.There are restaurants lining the entire market...we brought our purchases to one of them, got prawns and crabs grilled, fish sashimi, and the leftovers in a giant hot pot.  It was honestly one of the best meals of my life.  I can't recommend this experience highly enough!"
104,5.0,"We bought a huge lobster, a couple of catfish, large scallops, sea worms and some other indescribable sea creature.  I wish I could tell you where we ate, but a man took our catch and lead us down a back passageway to a small restaurant where a young guy prepared our feast.  Everything was delicious and perfectly prepared (well, I didn't try the really weird thing!)."
105,5.0,"The options were overwhelming but omg soooo goood!!! flounder sashimi, oysters were soooo fresh, king crab OMG steamed was SO GOOD! interestingly the abalone were grilled but it was VERY GOOD too!! tried the live baby octopus - interesting experience. vendors didn't speak english but some can speak in mandarin. there is some room for bargaining in the prices. i'm missing the seafood as i type this now!!"
106,3.0,"My 2nd time and the problem I or non Korean speaker will have is to negotiate and pay a fair price (unless you are mr moneybag). Yes, even if you can speak mandarin, it s difficult to gauge what is a reasonable to pay. It s an interesting market with many deep sea catch you will not see in your daily market eg live octopus, giant clams, giant prawns (the size of your forearm), all sorts of fishes ready to be eaten live or cooked. All said if you are prepared to pay, this should be an incredible place for fresh seafood. The complex is big but for a western traveller and the well heeled, the dank and wet pathways will not appeal to your senses.If you want the usual prawn tempura, walk to the far end and outside you will find a shack offering fish and prawn tempura at local prices.it is quite easy to get here by train, which is located outside Noryanin station. You need to get on a suburban train as opposed to metro to get here. Be game and try some local exotic like live octopus with live cut tentacles squirming in your mouth and belly"

Select what you want & the restaurants upstairs will cook it in the style of your choice. There's a ""cooking fee"" which varies according to style & type of seafood. Variety of beer & soju is available."
108,5.0,"You will never see more seafood in your life. Always good to go with a local and you will eat like kings and queens. The food, as fresh as it gets. Though not cheap, even locals will come here for sashimi, fresh seafood, and a great experience. The sashimi was great, the fish soup, even better. I've tried the same in Busan and both were great. Though I would say, come here not just for the food. The experience is truly unforgettable."
109,4.0,"The market is a nice place to see, very big fish market. Didnt purchase anything from there, as most people we have seen were just passer by. The things there might not be cheap also. Many stores helpers would ask you to go inside and take a look. They were very aggressive. We just ignored them and continue walking down the street. Walking distance from subway to there is abt 10 min. Once you see the overhead bridge, you just walk all the way and you can see the fish market. We walked passed the tempura store, selling 5 of them for 10,000 krw, abit pricey for that price."
110,4.0,"A very famous place for tourist! We can buy variety of seafood there  incl. hairy crab, abalone, octopus, etc.  Prices are very depending and seasonal but we found that it wouldn't have a big difference from shop to shop, perhaps they have an agreement behind? or our bargaining power is very low? We spent nearly 1 hour to walk part of the market, it's recommended to bring a camera with you to record this well-known market (especially from 2nd floor).  After that, the restaurants upstairs will cook and serve, of course involving extra charge.Like other wet market, the floor is wet and a bit slippery."
111,4.0,Be prepared to wear non slippery shoes as u would need to wash the shoes after leaving the place.There are so many stalls selling same kind of sea creatures and it's very crowded especially during evening time. You can purchase the live creature & bring it up to the restaurant upstairs. I went to this particular restaurant which was rcommended by a friend.Impressive and good to experience the feel of how Koreans enjoyed going to the fish market. Especially when you have your food together with the locals. It's definitely enjoyable.
112,1.0,"We, went to take the subway from the hotel in D Cube City and was lost after one stop short..if possible, take someone that can speak Korean or, they will cheat you! The last staff at the end of the line downstairs offer to cook at his restaurant when in fact, only sashimi or, sliced the fish raw!The restaurant is in hiding upstairs walkable and the nearby inside this np market does not open until later?Anyways, bargain hard or more than half and watch out when going into their restaurant where they recouped by charging double!Seedy practice, will not return!!If, ever in Busan Korea this fish market will be much more cleaner, civilized, not smelly, twice as large and go walk to the other side of the market since there are tons, plz see my Busan review of this market!Watch your wallet, this people are seedy and sleazy towards foreigners and does not/ will not speak English so can cheat without conscience...At your own risk..ok to look, do NOT purchase without a Korean at your side...good luck!"
113,5.0,"Loads of interesting live seafood to choose from, and you can choose to eat them alive, in steamboat, grilled, etc. Portions are quite big so make sure you go with a group of friends and not alone! After you've picked your food, choose a traditional resturant neaby that will cook them for you, your style! The crabs are seriously the freshest and best I have ever eaten (I guess you'll have to choose the right restuarant too) and they are perfect with korean makgoli. The food is much worth its price, so this is really a must go for everyone who can eat seafood. Make sure you compare prices (or even better, call along a local to help you bargain) as some stalls charge more than others. Also, wear shoes that don't have shoelaces, or just shoes you don't mind dirtying."
114,4.0,"Traditional market for fish. As a tourist, you must have visited this local market place. The smell is typical fish smell. You 'd better don't wear open shoes as the ground is wet and dirty. Parking is hard to find. Parking tower is very old and around 5pm everybody goes home at the same time. So do calculate some delay for parking and getting out the parking area. Perhaps, you 'd better come by metro. People are building a new fish market place near the current one. No idea when this opens."
115,5.0,"This fish market is HUGE and right off the metro. I'd never seen so much fish in one place. As other mentioned, it was a bit repetitive, but still fun to walk along and see all the fish. I'd never seen crab or prawns of such a size in America. Quite an experience. It didn't smell too fishy, either. We went around 6 p.m., and it was mostly a dinner crowd, with all sorts of shellfish and smaller fish. We settled on an olive flounder and the man threw in a rockfish and two smaller mackerel-like fish. After seeing him conk them over the head, I suddenly realized why women man the shellfish stalls and men man the fish stalls! He promptly turned the fish into sashimi and took us to a tiny restaurant where we ate the sashimi. The bones were turned into soup. The fish was $40, which was more than enough for the three of us, though this didn't include the restaurant fee. Still, it was cheaper than what we'd pay in the US and a lot more entertaining!"
116,4.0,"If you like fresh seafood, this is the place to go. The hundreds of seafood stalls will leave you spoilt for choices. Check out the sea urchins, prawns, abalones and highlight of Korea, the live octopuses that will still wriggle when you pick them out with your chopsticks! Most of the locals go there for the flatfish sashimi and you can see hotpots on almost every table. Be wary if you are selecting salmon sashimi though, some are dull in colour with a rancid after taste, obviously left out there for a long time.  http://poportion.blogspot.sg/2014/08/korea-day-4-noryangjin-fish-market.html"
117,4.0,"Very easy to get to on the metro. Once there we were amazed at all the varieties of fish & seafood available. If you are travelling with small children I am sure they would be fascinated to see all the different creatures (Free entertainment & learning experience forget aquariums!) upstairs there are restaurants who will cook seafood you buy. We went up & were approached by an owner who took us back down & helped us pick & buy seafood. Very helpful in a new environment,  we 4 adults bought a selection & it was cooked (grilled & in broth) for about $15 each. Great way to spend a morning & finish with lunch."
118,3.0,"the market is large but very repetitive, same same after you pass through one section. the prices are not particularly good and the quality is also not particularly good. much of the seafood is frozen, not live or fresh. u buy it and then take it to one of the restaurants at the market where they sashimi or cook it for you based on your preference. i'd rather go to street stall or restaurant with tanks."
119,4.0,"The fish market makes a fascinating visit, with a huge variety of octopus, crabs, lobster, prawns, clams, fish, abalone and sea urchins! You can buy what you want n bring it to any restaurants upstairs to either do sashimi style or to steam it! Cost of seafood is cheap, n food is so fresh. Be prepared for wet floors, n pungent fishy smells. Not a place to bring your babies in strollers."
120,4.0,"Its not your usual fish market you see across most countries -- here you can buy your own fish and eat it alive.. Disgusted ?? Well welcome to Korea. You can really find any kind of sea food here - crabs, oysters, shrimps, salmons and eat it while its still alive. Other than the variety of the market its the cultural experience that made it special for me. .. There are multiple small local restaurants with BYOF (bring your own fish) concept. Buy your fish/any kind of sea food from market and then at these restaurants they can serve it live or in a wok for you with beers or Ginseng tea. For me an Indian it was disgusting to begin with an different after a few minute and lively after a while experience.... Gave me a good insight to the liveliness and culture in Korea. Enjoyed my visit.. I did had some live crabs... (not sure if I would do it again, but surely worth once a lifetime experience).."
121,5.0,I've visited Noryangjin a few times and if you like seafood it is definitely one of the most fun things to do in Korea.  My advice is to look around for a bit and compare prices.  Prices are negotiable.  If you decide to buy raw fish then take it to a local restaurant (stall owners will take you to one) who for a fee will prepare it for you.
122,3.0,"The moment you stepped into Noryangjin Fish Market, a flood of merchants will start speaking to you in Chinese (which luckily we knew), showing you fishes and crabs which looks absolutely delicious. This was my 2nd time here at Noryangjin. The first time, despite the expensive price, the food was cooked well and the crab was succulent. This time when I went, it was a different restaurant instead. The food tasted a little salty and the seafood does not taste good. In total, we paid for the seafood, the per head count and also depends on the type of food you ordered (e.g. soup or grilled seafood) you will be charged accordingly. We paid a total of around USD100 for 3 small octopus, one crab and one fish. The seafood there is expensive but you can try your luck at haggling price with the merchants with some aegyo. lol.Anyway, this is a place I would recommend to first timers for the experience. But to get to try a lot of varieties, you might want to bring more friends to share the food."
123,4.0,"This market has a lot variety of fresh fish. In most cases the fish is still alive. Prices are very reasonable too. Of course being that it's a fish market, there is a smell. Also don't wear flip flops, because the floors are wet. The vendors are also very nice, and willing to let you try edible raw foods before you buy it. Not many speak english, but they do a good job communicating with simple questions. There is also a small restuarant, nothing fancy, that you can take your freshly chosen seafood and have them prepare it for you to eat. you pay a small fee of $2 for seating at the restaurant. Drinks, and side dishes is an additional fee. My friends and I enjoyed live octopus here for the first time. It was amazing."
124,3.0,"It's probably a place that's great for a one off experience, or going with ppl who has never been there, but not a place I'll revisit on my own.Local culture and flavor is fully felt there as we can't see this back in Singapore where we will choose our seafood and eat in fresh immediately. Also a first interesting experience in eating a live octopus whose tentacles can still move after dead haha.Be prepared to go out of this place smelling fishy!! Prepare some perfume or deodorant before hand. I think the price here is cheaper than Japan. Sashimi salmon was good too. Their scallop is abit different from the usual Japanese type though.Overall a good one off experience!"
125,5.0,"I first got lost. When you get off the train head out off exit 1. Go straight to the bridge towards the train tracks haha.. I wemt on the other one, which is pretty cool to explore if you wamt to try vendor food.  The market is on the bottom floor. Its big. The salmon is already caught up, so if you wamt to see some action order a flounder or snapper. These old ladies are tough and nice! I was able to bargain alot :) (you are supposed to bargain). The guys are not as animated as the ladies. I did try the live octopus. Its worth it whole not cut up :) ask for the hot sauce with your sashimi!!! Cheers!"
126,5.0,So fun!  Stopped at a random stall and pointed to live fish and shellfish (we didn't know what half of them were).  We carried them to the restaurant which prepared them (raw or cooked) for us.  With Soju it was a wonderful experience.  Highly recommend!
127,4.0,"Be prepared to get your feet a little wet and stinky. Driving is not too ideal during busy times as it can take literally an hour from the front of the fish market to drive to the side into the parking lot. The last tip is very important. There are a lot of really crappy restaurants and some good ones. Don't listen to anyone that is claiming all the restaurants are packed and to go to his restaurant. If he tries to grab your purchases, be aggressive and take your items back. Otherwise you will be like us and have 200+ dollars worth of fresh fish and lobster cooked into pure rubbery crap. I really wish I got the name of the place. It's on the first floor near an alley close to the bathrooms right when you get in from the parking lot. I believe it was Chinese owned, so if you want an authentic and honest experience, check out the restaurants upstairs.Even though the restaurant was a disappointment, the fish market still merits 4 stars as I believe if we picked a better one, our experience would have been significantly better."
128,2.0,"It is OK to visit this market if you have time.  My review here is a negative one on the restaurant (Ttosune Restaurant) that cooked our food.  If you want to enjoy and have a good memory of the Fish Market, then please be careful with the choice of restaurant that cooks your food.The market is in an enclosed building. You dine in windowless and mostly, small cramped restaurants in the upper levels. No sea view (in case you are thinking of being able to dine next to the wharf).Freshness and prices of seafood are ok but the spoiler is the ridiculous cooking charges. We were a party of four. We bought our seafood and were lead to Ttosune Restaurant where we were charged US$48 for the steaming of 2 small plates of shellfish, 1 plate of 1 crab (all without any seasoning), and a plate of stir fried squid. Even the diners next to our table (who are local Koreans) were appalled at the ridiculous prices. We tried to bargain before we were led in, but were told off by the impatient unsmiling lady boss and another ‘stern’ looking man, that it's a busy Saturday night and be quick to get to our table - we felt harassed. We only knew were were ripped off big time when we compared prices with the next table of local diners. They too were appalled by the prices charged on us. This really spoilt our visit to the Fish Market."
129,5.0,"a trip to noryangjin is not complete if one does not pick a live fish and be eating it in the next 5 minutes. the experience is surreal to be eating the freshest fish imaginable. the rows and rows of seafood, both live and not is sight to see and would make an awesome photograph and memory"
130,4.0,A must visit market if you love seafoods like me! ;) It is true that it is expensive... But it is worth it! We have a burp day!
131,2.0,"I was so excited about this place and finally got to go there with my colleagues, about 8 of us including 1 children. Well, why I rated this place so low not because of the ""Seafood"". The seafood sold here were wonderful, fantastic I would say. However, the low rating goes to the ""Cooking"". Such a nice and fresh seafood all wasted because the cooking simply terrible. No taste, over cook, etc... We bought prawns, abalone, scallops, squids, salmon, tuna and yellow tail sashimi. We decided to BBQ the prawns which has not much taste. For scallops, we opted to steam it and it was terribly done. Over cook and becomes hard and dry. Squid was fried and not much taste too. Abalone was raw as we decided to have it sashimi style. It was tough and not much taste too. However, it is really a very good experience for us or anybody to explore this place. I heard most of the locals(Korean) will go to this Fish Market to purchase the fresh seafood but will bring it home to cook themselves. Which now I totally believed."
132,4.0,"The fish market is huge - stall after stall of an assortment of live seafood. Hundreds of fishmongers try to sell you anything and everything. Prices are negotiable and it helps to know exactly what you want. You can then take your purchases to the restaurants adjacent to the fish market and they will cook it up for a small fee. We bought a few conches, shrimp, plate of oysters, salmon sashimi and mackerel (Cost about 50,000 Won and fed 4 of us) and was recommended by the vendor to one of the restaurants (I assume they're affiliated) saying they would give us a good rate on the cooking. (Turned out to be about 10,000 Won) Very fresh and tasty.Two things to note: 1) The market is very fishy and I can see how some people would be put off by this2) The vendors can be quite pushy trying to get you to buy something. It was a fun and interesting experience even if you don't end up buying anything."
133,1.0,"It's just some normal wet market which has many stalls that sell the same seafood. When you pass by the stalls, the sellers will use all kinds of touting methods to persuade you to buy their seafood. We were looking at some seafood at a particular stall, in which the auntie was telling us about how fresh their prawns were. Told them that we would take a look at other stalls first. The auntie was flustered by us as we did not buy from them at first. However, we went back to patronise her stall. 25000 won for 1kg of prawns. We were led to a restaurant (I've attached a picture) upstairs for our prawns to be grilled. We were charged 50,000++ won for just grilling of prawns + 1 bottle of soju. How ridiculous. Total paid is more than 75,000 won. The prawn we ate wasn't even fresh. Totally not recommended to waste time coming here."
134,4.0,"This is my second trip to Noryangjin Fish market and this time with friends. Very authentic local seafood place and easy to find using the subway Line 1. Love the energy at the market, the freshness of the seafood and the experience of eating seafood the Korean way.Two ways of getting your seafood: 1) First kind, you know what you want to eat and you have very good bargaining skills. You should head down to the first floor where all the fishmongers will try to sell you their seafood and you need to bargain hard, be firm, know what to get and how much you are willing to pay. Then go to the second floor with your seafood and choose a restaurant where they will cook your seafood with some charges. During my first trip, we had to bargain very hard and bought a snow crab, a flounder, a big prawn and a small octopus with a free sea pineapple (sea squirt) thrown in, costing about 80,000-90,000won. Then we paid about 20,000won (I think) for the cooking charges at the restaurant.2) Second kind, you want to eat a variety of food and couldn't be bothered to bargain for each item. You should then go to the second floor and find a restaurant that suit your needs and get your food bought and cooked all at the restaurant. My second trip was with friends who just want sashimi (raw fish), so we went to a restaurant that serves sashimi and the lady boss recommended that we ordered for 2 person's portion (even though we were 3 people) which was 70,000won. With all the side dishes (which includes octopus, prawns, shells in small portions and fish stew, and sashimi of different fish, we were able to eat to our hearts content. Both experience was interesting, just that I am not much of a bargaining person, so it was less stressful the second time round. Still, it was fun and definitely well worth the trip to Noryangjin Fish market."
135,4.0,"I went here at fall season last 2010, good temperature and not to crowded inside the fish market..I came with my friend at lunch time, first I took a picture around market and see how clean the market, after visiting and tasting on the spot then I try to choose some fish for ""sashimi"" dish then some for soup and the server ask me to go upstairs waiting the food, the room is too small but hhmmmm I enjoyed the food !"
136,4.0,"Located at subway Noryangin, choose your fresh seafood and take it to the restaurants within the markets itself. Fresh seafood out of tanks taste really different from those at supermarket. Not expensive. 3 abalones for krw10,000. The seafood is brought to the restaurant, and the restaurant charges a small fee for preparing the food. 3 of us had octopus, abalone, crab, clams... The service fee for cooking all these were krw17,000."
137,4.0,"Interesting experience with many different types of fresh seafood. Do try the sashimi which was very fresh.If you are brave enough, try the live octopus which grips onto your tongue as you chew on it.Be prepared to bargain and look at different stalls before choosing as the vendors will overcharge tourists."
138,4.0,"Don't, and I really mean it, don't go to the fish market wearing your best shoes. It was an impulse visit, I was already dressed and the whole time I was there, a tiny part of me died for my Ferragamos. To be fair, the market wasn't dirty at all. I think there was a conscientious effort from vendors to spray water on the floor and clean it constantly because the place was wet. (So I wouldn;tr wear scandals or flip-flops there as well if I were to visit in summer.)Also, I visited in spring so there was no unpleasant odours. Not sure about summer though. Coming from a country where wet markets have almost all been phased out due to hygiene and 'aesthetical' concerns, it was a great experience coming to the fish market and seeing whole, live, fresh seafood instead of the those gutted, cleaned, sliced and neatly packaged ones we find in a typical supermarket. There were rows and rows of stalls, all crammed with seafood. I have never seen a greater variety of seafood in my life. My husband swore that some of the sea creatures looked as if they belonged in scenes in sci-fi movies. If you come from a land-locked country, it will be a great place to visit. And I say, please don't be put off by the appearances of the sea creatures. Though some are absolutely nasty looking, they are usually the most succulent and tastiest when simply prepared. The seafood wasn't as cheap as what I would have expected. Then again, I fully expected the vendors to jack up the prices for tourists, Maybe you would have better luck with a Korean companion. For me, I will just have to wait until my Korean is better before I can try to knock the prices down. As most vendors carry almost the same seafood, we basically just picked out a nice lady and bought a whole fish, a kilogram of prawns and some salmon. Though the fish market can be quite a tourist trap, it is certainly convenient -- you don't have to sing for your supper. The lady's companion asked us how we would like our fish and prawns done. Then he whipped out his cellphone and made a call. In 2 minutes flat, a man showed up, took our seafood and led us to one of the small hole--in-a-wall type of restaurants at the back, crammed with salarymen types all pouring drinks for each other and coaxing each other to drink. We didn't even have to carry our seafood! We had the prawns grilled and the fish done 2 ways. Sashimi and the remaining parts were cooked in a spicy broth with kimchi, mushrooms, ginger, and green vegetables. For the sashimi, you can enjoy it dipped in a combination of wasabi and soy sauce (the Japanese way I supposed) or do it this way (the Korean way?): wrapped the fish in a piece of lettuce, added sliced garlic, chili and popped the whole neat package into your mouth. I prefer the latter as the chili really gave the fish a nice kick. The grilled prawns were good with some lemon squeezed over them and dipped in chili. We brought the salmon home and cooked them a few nights later. It was really, really good!."
139,4.0,"I was like a child in a candy store. Wanted it all!!! My Korean friend helped me calm my nerves with a beer and he obliged with ordering the best of all that they had on offer. Live Prawns, Oysters, et all . . . Some experience this. I tried the fish market in Busan and found that one cleaner / better!"
140,4.0,"Certainly a place to visit whilst in Seoul just to experience the vastness of the hall.  Most vendors seem to have similar stock, and we browsed around first, before venturing upstairs to one of the busier looking restaurants for lunch.  We certainly had plenty of food with our 'sashimi set menu', however the actual fish which we ate wasn't all that appetising, and more on the chewy side.  However, that was more down to what we ordered!Definitely a place to check-out whilst in Seoul"
141,4.0,"We had a nice morning over at Noryangjin Fish Market. Quite often though people approach you and offer you their most expensive fish (lobster etc) and you can bet that they will inflate the price you pay compared to Koreans. We didn't purchase anything, just lurked about checking out what was on offer. It gets pretty wet and fishy as you can imagine so where suitable footwear. You WILL smell of fish when you leave so as long as you are aware of that you shouldn't be in for any other suprises."
142,5.0,"Let me start out by saying that I had a terrible time at the fish market. My back was killing me, and my stomach was queasy that day. Neither of these things really lead to a fantastic fish market experience. That said, the market itself was pretty amazing. There was more or less anything out of the ocean that you might possibly be ale to eat, somewhere there, and usually a selection of vendors for all but the most eclectic items. If you like octopus, this place will make you sad.  There are tens of thousands of octopus there, either alive or dead. Poor creatures. Poor tasty, tasty creatures. You can pick out your ocean creature and then take it to a nearby restaurant to have it cooked and to have the side dishes made. Whether you plan to buy fish or not, just browsing is certainly an experience. It's super super easy to find from the metro, and is worth the journey."
143,5.0,"This is the best place if you are seafood lovers.  You can pick your favourite yummy seafood first and the shop will bring you to the restaurants area, and you tell them how you want them to cook for you.  Cannot miss the fresh BIG crabs and it's so yummy and inexpensive.  Not frozen one, they are all fresh. and if you are brave enough, don't miss the octopus.... though they are cut into pieces, it's still moving.... and when you put them in your mouth, you will say 'wow... ~  ^o^  Noryangjin market is a 'must go', if you always visit Tsukiji fish market in Japan,then this will be a good choice for you. The restaurants open for dinner time."
144,4.0,"What better way to start off my time in Seoul than a trip to Noryangjin Fish Market. You just can't beat the value and freshness. It's certainly not a fancy meal out, but if you like good food like me and don't really care about the ambiance then this is the place to go. Also, its open really early which is good for when you are suffering from jet lag and can't sleep. I like going to see all of the live seafood tanks. You can find pretty much anything that swims here.My friend and I arrived and as soon as we got out of the taxi we could smell the fish so I knew we were close. After looking around a little we settled on getting king crab, abalone, sea squirt, and prawns. We haggled for a good price, then the seller bagged up our ""catch"" and escorted us upstairs to one of the restaurants where they cooked it all up for us. Its recommended to tell the cook to ""butta goey"" (butter grilled) the abalone.We also got the maeuntang (spicy fish stew). This is usually made up from the left overs if you get a fish, but you can order it even if you don't get fish. Let the soup cook for a long time and the broth becomes a fantastic masterpiece so good that it may cause you to dream about it days latter and will become one of the things you crave after leaving Korea."
