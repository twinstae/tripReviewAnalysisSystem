0,5.0,"A bustling atmosphere, a lot of activity, and a variety of small shops.  Prepare to be overwhelmed on Day 1 and go back for Day 2 with better a bigger shopping bag. Leave plenty of room in your suitcase for Goto Mall shopping!"
1,5.0,"The items sold here are cheaper compared to Namdaemun market and any other underground shopping malls.I need to get a new winter outfits as I did not bring any to my Seoul trip.In less than â‚©50k you can get a complete outfits, head to toe.I came by bus no 401 from namsan tunnel 3 near Myeongdong. Take the bus stop that heading to the tunnel.The stop is Express Bus Terminal. There are also subway lines that stop at Express Bus Terminal and you need to walk to the mall through the underground shopping pathway.I took bus as it is easy as the stop is just in front of the Gate to the mall-Gate 8-2.There are many entrance but that Gate i found nearer to the bus stop. I came here twice, Unfortunately it was closed during Lunar New Year, and even only a day off some of the shops extended to close esp the flower shopsðŸ˜”The crowds started around 1-2am even the shops opened at 10am. It was a long stretch shops with eateries at the both ends.It was winter and to shop in the warmth and covered mall was soo much convenience."

3,3.0,"When it comes to cheap clothing, this place tops it all, it has all the usual cosmetic shops and loads of clothing stores, but the quality and the styles are more towards to over 30s. Not too sure about youngsters..."
4,4.0,"To get here, you could easily take the subway lines 3, 7 or 9. Take exit 8 for the nearest access to this mall and with a little exploring you are There!"
5,5.0,"This is definitely the best place for shopping now. I went to Seoul 5 years ago and everyone was going to Dongdaemun for cheap clothes but GOTO is so much better. This would be my first place to go for shopping next time I'm in Seoul. I could easily shop here for 2 days as its massive. When you come out of the subway both sides, left and right has places to shop. Highly recommend!"
6,4.0,"Besides clothes and cosmetics, there is also quite an interesting range of household goods like crockery and lovely turkish lamps. And the beautiful flowers( fresh and otherwise) on offer at one end of the mall provide a pleasant respite from all the bargain hunting. This mall is definitely worth a visit."
