1,4.0,The highlight is off course the multi story public library .But there are also variety of stores and restaurants.
2,4.0,"The huge, pile of books but arrange neatly on the second floor which can be seen from the ground floor makes the mall stunning, and instagrammable foto opts!"
3,4.0,Love this mall as it has nice shops with international and Korean brand.  Very crowded on weekend and the beautiful library is also the main attraction. The Hyundai hall is a good place to start to hunt for food. You can easily spend your day here.
4,5.0,"Staying at a hotel at COEX was great- we had lots of food choices, and several things to do on our doorstep.  The COEX library was beautiful by day and night, we bought souvenirs at the aquarium, and even saw K-Pop stars that did an autograph session at the mall one evening.  Special shout-out to Papavalley Pizza, which was utterly delicious. If I were to add some things to this mall, it would be a couple more places serving a hot western breakfast."
5,5.0,Took the KTX train Seoul to Busan. The train ride was fast but only on few occasions did we touch the 298 km/h mark. But it was nice and thrilling enough
6,4.0,"While the daughters were touring the SM COEXartium to get their fill of SM kpop, we enjoyed wandering through this upscale mall.  Both Korean and International stores were located in this large, modern mall.  Food options were plentiful and many looked trendy and inviting.  A huge library was located in the center.For more Kpop things, we went outside the mall to see the massive Gangnam Horse Hand sculpture inspired by Psy's Gangnam Style song which was viewed over 1 billion times on youtube."
7,3.0,"The library was huge and very nice! But almost all the books are in Korean so unless you know Korean or bring your own book, it’s simply a place to sit, relax, and people watch. There are also cafes and an E-Mart inside the library."
8,3.0,The underground mall is a great place to go during the winter months. There are plenty of stores to browse. My favorite park is the public library inside!
9,3.0,"Given this mall is spread so wide, it will take much walking to cover the grounds. You will find all your known brands inside. They even have an aquarium but will need entrance fees @ 28k won to enter. Lots of restaurants and cafes as well."
10,4.0,"The mall can be reached via 2 subway stations, Samseong and Bongeunsa. Can walk straight via underground into the mall. With many retail shops, F&B and SM Town (a 6 floors k-pop museum), one can spend hours in here. Special mention to the brilliant library which is a must visit. It’s an open concept."
11,4.0,"Coex is very huge mall with lots of shops, restaurants and entertainment places like cinema, aquarium etc. However the best thing about this mall is the amazing libaray in the middle of the mall. If you tired after lots of walking at the mall, you can relax at the library even though most if the books in Korean. Shops are ordinary, nothing is unique and most of them is Korean product."
12,4.0,"If you have seen the movie Beauty and the Beast, you know the scene where the Beast takes the blindfolded Belle into his library and then, upon removing her blindfold, she looks up and all around and sees this library that stretches as far as the eye can see in all directions. THIS is the same library! I am sure of it! Perhaps it was the inspiration for this portion of the movie. Come to COEX Mall just to see the library and you will understand what everyone is talking about! I loved seeing entire families sitting there together with books. I was amazed to see children off all ages, sitting in nooks against the window panes, reading. How wonderful of Korea to have inspired so many children to enjoy the simplicity of curling up with a good book. A real, actual book, not a tablet or a computer. A paper book to hold in their hands. I hope more countries will be inspired as well."
13,5.0,The library made me dream. The most amazing place ever. I had never seen any library like it in all my travels. I had to visit this place three times because I couldn't get enough and it was worth it. The mall had many stores. You could shop to your heart content. There was also an aquarium and great restaurants.
14,5.0,"Housing the largest underground mall in Asia, this place served as a great respite from the blistering 2018 summer heat. You will find plenty to do here - there is even a library! There are also plenty of familiar names for shopping. Having come here with the family, my wallet was very much lighter when we left!!"
15,4.0,"Great things about this Mall1. The library: beautiful2. great collection of stores3. has a aquarium, great for kids4. easy to get to by subway(via line 2 green line)However, you need to watch out for LUNCH TIME.  All the restaurants are packed with hungry lunch goers, you literally have to wait in line for everything. You can't even find a seat at the cafeteria.  It's just that busy.  So my advice is eat early or eat late, just don't expect to walk into a restaurant around 12:30 and get a table right away."
16,4.0,Specifically visited here just to see the Library within this shopping mall!! It was wonderful to be surrounded by so many books and so many people reading!! The glass roof is a great addition for those studying below. I'd love to know how they reach the ones at the top!!
17,4.0,"The stores are really expensive, but you can find cheap stuff if you're determined. The food court is breathtaking, the variety is huge. There's even a supermarket part of the mall, with kind and helpful employees. The library speaks for itself."
18,4.0,It’s a huge underground mall with many stores selling so many things and some restaurants. Worth seeing if you’re in Seoul. We did not go to the aquarium or cinema so cannot comment on those. A typhoon was expected the day we went so it was wet which may have accounted for the crowds.
19,4.0,With the locals even on a weekday. Not sure if it’s the season but most of the Brand are on sale. There’s a good mixed of local and foreign Brand. Good place if you’re looking for fashion and cosmetics.
20,5.0,"it's a must visit shopping mall, we can find something different from any others, when shopping mall and a library as one. very instagramable, take picture right at the library or the mega popcorn at the mega box cinema, I bet you won't regret it."
21,4.0,"If you are an ardent Kpop fan, this is one mall you wouldn’t miss going to. An entire section is devoted to promoting the Kpop stars and their merchandise. There is even a cafe there. For the rest of the mall, there is a huge library with floor to ceiling bookshelves that can take your breath away. The shops there are extensive and it is linked to the Hyundai Department Store that has about 8 floors for the shopaholics to satisfy their shopping cravings."
22,3.0,"Family and I came to this mall for shopping on the recent vacation. A member of the family got  stomach issues from bad food for several days. Finally could not wait any longer so we stopped by a doctor office for medical attention. All we paid was about $20 for doctor visit(in the state it could cost hundreds without insurance), the clinic  look very professional, inside the doctor office there are medical instruments(high tech and low tech) all around. After consultation, doctor prescribed medicine that we got at a pharmacy next door, very convenient."
23,4.0,"Large mall, variety of shops and brands, with a great library. Different restaurants with halal options."
24,1.0,This mall in  gangnam area and it far from my Hotel Lotte city.In my opinion this mall is waste of time nothing especial  and you can not compare it with lotte department store.It too expensive.This place is good for meeting not shopping.In fact this place was huge mall before change it.I will not come back
25,5.0,"After visiting SM Town, we visited the COEX mall next door and decided to grab lunch at one of the many restaurants located inside. The mall is massive: there are lots of stores and restaurants that we didn't have time to check out. What I liked about this mall was the underground passage that connected to the mall. We were there during Christmas and it was snowing, but due to the underground walkways we were able to cross to the other side without any difficulties from the weather."
26,5.0,"This clean and well maintained mall is located right off of The Samsung Subway Station which makes it very convenient to get to. We went here to bring our 2 boys to the Coex Aquarium which is located at the other end of the mall.This mall has such stores as Zara, A-Land, NIke, Under Armour, Levi's, American Eagle Outfitters and many others. Also there are over 30 different restaurants to grab a bite at. This mall also has a huge ""Starfield Library"" and a movie theater called The Megabox. You can also access the Hyundai Department Store, The KITA Trade Tower, 7 Luck Casino, Lotte Duty Free and The Intercontinental Hotel from here. This mall can also be accessed from the Bongeunsa Subway Station as well."
27,4.0,"We went to the COEX mall mainly for the aquarium however the shopping and food outlets provided extra attraction. The mall is easy to get to and is very modern. The food court offers a good variety of Asian cuisine but many individual restaurants are available of different culture. The library here in the centre of the mall is the biggest ever. Such a large variety of shopping, you are sure to find most things here."
28,4.0,"We went to Coex 2 evenings in October 2016.  One night we we to check it out and for dinner options.  There are so many restaurants.  It was a 7 minute ride from seongsu station here.  The mall is  2 levels, but there is a mini level by the aquarium hidden in a corner with eateries there too.  Very bright and clean looking throughout.  Many clothing stores.  There is a large good court too.  Also, a movie theatre and aquarium.  Aquarium was very good on the other night.  It closes at 8 pm with ticketing ending at 7.  We got lost trying to find our way back from the aquarium one night, but discovered the food court which had lots of seating and some nice options.  Here we ate bulgogi and noodle soup with galbi short ribs."
29,3.0,"It is a large shopping mall. Suggest you check out the flow of the traffic and understand reach one end to the other. There is an acquarium, cinema, amusement park, supermarket and lots of coffee chains. Definitely a nice place to spent a cold winter or extremely hot summer. Take time to browse through some of the stuff which is Korean unique. Avoid the office crowd from 12-2 pm."
30,5.0,"This is a gigantic mall. You can find all the big name Korean brands as well as American and European brands as well. Super fun to go with the family, so many the escalators, the kids should enjoy it. Plenty of food and resting areas as well."
31,5.0,We took Gangnam station line 2 to reach coex mall. It takes around 7 minutes. The mall is too big and quite. Many restaurants are there and you can find Halal too. Many famous brand you will find with Korean brand.
32,4.0,"This is a huge underground mall which has a stature of gangnam style hands outside which is a tourist op. Inside has a money change bank , lots of food places, subway access. and of course commercial shops. Good to spend half  a day if the weather outside is too extreme. But it is very commercial. Doesn't represent the true culture or Korean style in my opinion. So a couple of hours is the most you should spend here. It is across the street from the temple so it's handy to cool off or refresh after the temple visit."
33,4.0,"This mall is very much like every other mall.  There is a very good variety of shops and it has all the major skincare brands and make up brands. The clothes shops are also very trendy and cool. The food malls have a large variety to choose from, the is halal food for Muslims, which is very convenient and new. Last time I visited almost 2 years ago, the wasn't any halal places to eat. Now there is, which I am very happy about! The staff are very helpful and friendly. The location is very easy to find, right next to Samseong station. The mall is located in a very nice area, very up and coming!"
34,3.0,If you are a SM Town fans you will find this place so great you can find your bias merchandise and they have a coffee shop and theater. there are a mall next to it have some shops and its next to the metro station
35,4.0,"If I were organizing a world conference with 30,000 participants, this would be a very attractive venue. Sandwiched between 2 5 star hotels, the conference centre and mall are testimony to South Korea's economic success. The most fascinating part is the Hyundai Department store basement, where you can get an overview of a wide variety of Korean food."
36,5.0,"It's a huge mall with lot of stuffs to explore, clothing, entertainment, souvenir, food, aquarium, etc. You could easily spend a day there. We have a great time there and think it's worth a visit."
37,5.0,"The Coex is a big complex with shopping and entertainment in underground and hotels, city airport, bus terminal, hotels, casino etc on ground and other floors. The big conference complex is the main area where lot of foreigners come. It has some good restaurants. There is a bank near south gate and gives good exchange rate.Big aquarium is a good show. Some Shops allow a little bargain but most are branded."
38,5.0,"I was an easy access from our hotel ( Oakwood premier coex) where you can find delicious food (Halal)😋, bakeries, 😘 sweets sand many 😍 shops to choose from. You can have your gifts from there like we did. 😊 Also it has an aquarium 🐠🐟🐡🐧🦀😌 which we enjoyed so much."
39,4.0,The mall is huge and has a ton of stores and restaurants.  It is a great indoor activity for a rainy day.  There is also an aquarium that was awesome for my young child.
40,3.0,"This used to be one of my favourite areas to hang out in. There aren’t a large number of crowds, and the area is humongous anyway. However, I feel that the way the shops are laid out isn’t very well-planned. You’d find an area with food in one corner, walk for another 10 minutes and find another cluster of food stalls at another area. The signage/directions are rather confusing at times and the place is too big, it can be a pain if you are looking for a specific shop and realise you have to walk around 20 minutes just to get to it. The developers could have built more floors instead of having almost 95% of all the shops on the same level. There are a lot of international brands as well, so shopping isn’t particularly interesting for me. I feel that guidebooks tend to over-rate this place way too much."
41,2.0,"A bunch of international brands and designers with just a few korean ones. Used to be a big mall with loads of korean shops and studio ghibli store. Now it's a big mall with mostly boring shops.. Used to be worth the visit, not anymore. Now it's a great place for locals.."
42,5.0,"It's a one-stop-shop-kind-of-mall, it has everything for everyone. It has hotels connected to it, the MRT station, an aquarium for the kids, grocery, convenience store, international and local brands as well."
43,5.0,"COEX Mall looks very futuristic from the inside, a maze of ways to go with a huge Cinema, Aquarium, food court and dozens od stores to shop in.  Easy access to Hyundai Department store as well."
44,5.0,"If you're in the market for a ""cool"" ""mall"" – and assuming there is such a thing – in Seoul, then Coex should make you happy. It is large and maze-like enough to get lost in. There are nice stores you don't often find in Seoul – Brooks Brothers Black Label, Molton Brown, GAP + GAP Kids, Nike, Addidas, Kiels, Marimekko, a bunch of other cool clothing shops, cool home decor shops, a Gundam Robot shop and TONS of cafes and good restaurants. And that's not even including the Hyundai department store. If you venture around to the bottom of the Hyundai department store, there are lots of bakeries selling awesome treats, a shop selling the best Korean mochi treats (dduk) that I have found in Seoul – including one with white cake crumbs which tastes like birthday cake that my whole family absolutely loves, a good wine shop and a cool place to find interesting kitchen items from around the world.… so… if you're looking for a day to wander around aimlessly indoors… a place that will keep everyone in the whole family happy… yeah… give Coex a wander.Also there usually seems to be some sort of a special event or pop up store event happening here, so you never know what you'll bump into."
45,4.0,"I liked COEX Mall before the renovation. It was smaller and had more of a vibe. Now it's huge but lacks any imagination. On a weekday it feels empty due to its expansiveness. On weekends, it's better. Unless you're there to watch a movie or visit the aquarium, there isn't much to do but shop and eat. I guess that's fine for most but I for kids, it can be a bit boring."
46,5.0,This mall is huge! It was under remodel last year and now they are done. Lots of places to eat and shop and is conveniently off the subway.
47,2.0,"Sells branded stuff , things are really expensive. Not many shops too. I won't had gone there if I knew it was like this! Waste of time!"
48,1.0,"Or it might as well be closed.  There are miles (kilometers) of boarded-up shops.  Signs everywhere stating that the mall is being refurbished, sorry for any inconvenience...Only a few restaurants are open, the movie theater is open, and I think the aquarium is open.  All else is just boarded-up, empty hallways that seem to stretch to infinity.  And then when you get to the end of an empty hallway, you turn the corner to see...another empty hallway.Not sure how long this refurbishment is going to take, but I would not suggest anybody visit Coex mall in 2014.  It seems to be a huge construction site, not something that will be finished in a few months...The picture (attached to this review) is about the most exciting thing you will see at Coex mall, right now..."
49,5.0,"What can you do it Coex? Whatever you can imagine..Shop (both luxury and cheaper brands), Eat & Drink, Movie, Play, Spa, Casino, Aquarium, even get a transportation to airports...etcCOEX mall is massive..also it is connected to Hyundai Department Store, Samsung City Airport Terminal, 2 InterContinental Hotels (Grand InterContinental & InterContinental Coex), Oakwood Premier Coex Center (Residence/Hotel), 7Luck Casino, Lotte Dutyfree Shop...etc. The mall also has MegaBox movie theater and Aquarium.For the people with little kids, it is a challenge to walk about and find things in this massive place.However, the mall does offer strollers for the little ones. As you enter into the mall from Samsung Station, (the far right door, that is next to Marche restaurant), keep walking down the main street till you see a information desk that is kind of right before the escalators.You can borrow strollers (I think this service requrs your ID card) from there.Trust me...this will really help you to enjoy the place pleasantly with your little ones."
50,1.0,"After visiting Lotte Myeongdong the night before, we went to Coex with anticipation. Coex Mall was huge with a few malls and departmental stores joined together in the underpass. However, the place had just begun its refurbishment when we visited and many shops and restaurants were closed since end Mar. Megabox cineplex, the Aquarium, Lotte Duty Free and the big bookstore were still opened. There were only limited local dining options. Coex looked like a mall from the 80s. The public bathrooms stink. Yes, Coex NEEDS the refurbishment. We were quite disappointed by the Coex experience, really. Wish the hotel concierge could have told us and saved us the time (45 mins in evening peak traffic) to cab there from Gangbuk."
51,4.0,"Stay in the coex intercontinental hotel is my favourite and one of reason is because of the coex mallHere i love the variaties of foods from local korean to chinese dimsum or internationalHere also an aquarium, big oneThe movies with multi choices, a good option to kill timeThe choices of the shops are very goodI saw a samsung show room, the staf was able to speak english in a fashion way, knowing not many korean speak english well.I recommend to visit this coex mall when you stay at coex intercontinental hotel"
52,3.0,"This is a huge mall with almost anything a person would need. It is very convenient if you live in the area, but nothing special."
53,4.0,"If you have only a few days to stay in Seoul and would like to see different part of it (from places like Namdaemoon or Myungdong), Coex mall is the place to go. Located in the middle of one of the most expensive land of Seoul, everything is expected to be a bit more pricey. Nevertheless, you can shop, eat, sight-see all in the underground mall! You may notice that the crowd is younger, more-hip, and maybe even richer. Good place to people-watch! ;-)"
54,5.0,You'll never get tired of walking around this mall... great shops and of course a lot of restos too!!!
