0,4.0,"I like to come here at night as it is always lit up with pretty lanterns and with the water gently flowing it provides a nice distraction and break from the hustle and bustle of the city. On the roads either side there are a number of coffee shops, restaurants and other points of interest."
1,3.0,"I walked almost the complete length and back of the stream. It was winter and during the morning hours so there were few people, no night lighting or street food stalls and alas the plants were not looking their best in the cold. Itâ€™s a nice walk, but nothing exceptional. Maybe during spring/summer and at night the place would be more spectacular."
2,5.0,Do find some time to stroll the length of this cool stream that cuts the city. You will feel as though you have detached from the hustle and bustle of the city. Several subway stops will lead you here. Check it out if feel that the city is getting to be too much!
3,5.0,This was a very great use of space to add something natural but man made. It gives back to nature in a concrete world.
4,5.0,Lightings and umbrella decorations are very unique about this place. You can scroll along the stream while enjoying the night view and try some street food stalls. Must visit place in Seoul.
5,5.0,"My recommendation is to devote a good few hours to walk through it from the starting point (The big blue & red shell statue. IDK the name, it was all in Korean ðŸ˜…)"
6,5.0,"This stream is a nice place to relax and take a walk in Seoul. Can sometimes get crowded on the weekends, but it's a nice natural space in the middle of the city."
7,4.0,This is a lovely part of town to get some atmosphere and have a short walk. Nice fountains and stepping stones along the way.
8,5.0,Great to final see this restoration in person. Great rewinding. Herons in the middle of a mega city!
9,5.0,"A fascinating place.  I'm impressed by the effort and resources Seoul invests on city beautification, cultural and historic preservation projects. Who would have thought that this stream was once paved over and was a major road. Its actually really nice and I know it reaches all the way to Dongdaemun. If I had time, I'd walk further and enjoy the diversity and culture. Its a great place yo go at night. Great for social gatherings, dates and running."
10,4.0,This stream was once clean or concrete however trees and shrubs have been allowed to grow with a noticeable change since I first came to Seoul in 2009.The stream has a walking path close to the stream with stairs coming down to stream level.Iâ€™ve been here before during the evening and it does attract a lot of locals walking along its course.Nice to see.
11,4.0,"This is a 10 km long modern stream that runs through downtown Seoul. I walked a portion of the stream, from Gwangjang Market to Dongdaemun during a weekday afternoon. It was rather quiet, with a few locals sitting along the bank to relax and chill. I suppose it is livelier in the evening."
12,5.0,Very nice to walk or have early morning jogging. Nicely and thoughtfully decorated. Highly recommend to have walk through.
13,5.0,"This is one of the best walks in Seoul. You can follow yhe stream, make stops below or above ground to do a variety of things. Or you can find a spot relax, and get away from the city while being in the center of it."
14,4.0,So a concrete overhead highway was removed and the stream below restored to create this urban oasis in the heart of a busy city. What a tranquil respite to go for a walk along this water. It runs for several miles going under bridges and there's some neat artwork along the way. Good for a day or nighttime stroll.
15,5.0,It's pretty picturesque during the day then at night with the lighting it gives it another just as picturesque side. Cool to just wander along with plenty to look at along the way. Also worth joining the Spooky Side of Seoul tour which takes in part of the stream and gives some interesting history if you're a lover of the macabre.
16,5.0,Love how they converted this stream into a nice park and place to rest and relax for the people and visitors to Seoul.  I hope they maintain it as just a park and not be invaded by commerce.  Its a much nicer stroll at night .
17,5.0,"People like to strolling around the stream, especially on summer. You have to be careful on rainy days because the stream will be closed to prevent the floods."
18,5.0,"Its a very long stream stretch few KM. Along the stream you can find nicely placed stepping stone, nice and calm small water stream, underneath water fixture, and most importantly, its clean.. Lot of Koreans can be spotted having good and romantic time.. There are lot of entries to this place, may google for the suitable exit from metro station from your hotel. It is very impressive how korean people built this and make a small water stream as one of tourist spot just to have relaxing night. The idea very smart"
19,4.0,"My hotel, the VenueG, fronted onto this restored stream. It was a convenient riverwalk type park that ran right into the heart of Seoul and within sight if the main square and the Palace.There were fish in the stream and it was quite a little oasis of quiet in an otherwise chaotic area.I found it very useful navigating in reference to it as it was conspicuous on the maps and easy to find by street. There was a very cool ornament at the downtown end and there was a large tourist centre as well."
20,5.0,"Seoul is an absolutely fabulous city full of fun, excitement, beauty, culture, but it is hectic. This stream in the middle of it all is an amazing escape and peaceful oasis where you can walk, sit and people watch and just recharge."
21,5.0,Lovely having this very pretty space right in the city - it's cool and quiet down there - very relaxing !
22,4.0,"As an escape from the hustle and bustle of the city Iâ€™d really recommend taking a walk along this river. Thereâ€™s plenty of notices to read regarding how the area was recovered and regenerated and the different styles along the walk are impressive. Itâ€™s nice that over the weekend it wasnâ€™t too busy, and itâ€™s kept really clean in keeping with the rest of the city. If only to admire the work behind the regeneration, but also to see another side of the city, Iâ€™d walk down here again."
23,5.0,The stream right in the city was a welcome spot to relax and enjoy the environment.  Across the street from my hotel was very easy to find.
24,4.0,"The stream look very normal during day time, just normal stream, but is very clean.  When comes to night time, there will be neon lights lighted up and you can see many people strolling along the sidewalks of the stream. Parents with kids, couples.  Nice time to stroll."
25,4.0,This place will relax your mind even during winter.  Do not miss this stream few blocks away from Seoul plaza ang Gyeongbokgung Palace.
26,4.0,"Just in the middle of the city there is this stream. Cool to walk a couple of blocks and relax. Easy to see as part of many attractions in historic city (palace, market)."
27,4.0,"I like to take a stroll here and watch the fish. There are some fishes in the water that you can just watch to kill time if you want. Also, you can book a free tour here too, very awesome. My tour guide told us that there are some koi fish in the water, and they go back to Han's river to lay eggs, and then they come back to the stream to visit. It was interesting how fish knows how to do that!! Well, this is a lovely place to come and see, read a book, take pictures, and have a bite."
28,4.0,"I'd read a lot about the river in Seoul that had been rejuvenated. On a long business visit to Seoul, I decided to see it for myself.I took a couple of trains that brought me to the stream. The stream is quite long and has a fair number of visitors but it never feels crowded and you can always find a spot to dip your feet and watch the world go by.The water is crystal clear and there are areas with fountains that make for a nice view. Towards evening, LED lights come up and make it an enchanting place.I would highly recommend visiting this venue. It's a lovely way to spend an evening in Seoul and an oasis of calm in a hustling metropolis. I wish more cities took the effort to create public places of this nature."
29,3.0,"There is no way to miss it, although I would not go out of my way to see it. A path walkway along both sides of a small stream of water in the middle of a noisy city is where you can spend a few peaceful minutes. Some areas are wider and have granite like floor whereas; as you walk away form downtown you get a more bucolic feel."
30,4.0,"What a peaceful, yet lively place! If you're ever in Seoul, take a stroll along the stream and enjoy your time. If I loved closeby, I think I would want to walk there every morning.What I really liked was the mix of nature and art at the stream. As you walk down the path, youâ€™ll come across murals, paintings, and even plaques that write about the history of the stream."
31,5.0,"From my hotel, it was a short walk to the Cheonggyecheon Stream. I went late in the afternoon and before I left, the lights were on in the lantern decorations in the stream. It is a peaceful place. The sound of the running water is soothing. The Festival of Lights was beautiful."
32,5.0,"If you want to escape the hustle of Seoul without even leaving it, his stream is the right place. You can walk for a long time in peace, watching fish swim along the stream. It is absolutely gorgeous on a sunny day and easily accessed via metro"
33,4.0,"The views are nice with large fish in the river, the scene is very peaceful, with the city sounds easily muffled by the rushing waterRather than visit the stream for itself, the best way is to visit the many indoor and outside shopping malls along its 6 mile course and then walk a little of the stream's path to get from one market to another."
34,4.0,"Having arrived from Europe after two long flights the day before I was in dire need of stretching my legs. I was pleasantly surprised that the Cheonggyecheon Stream starts quite close to the City Hall and my hotel. I threw my little rucksack onto my back and proceeded to walk downstream. I didnâ€™t track how far I walked. It was just nice to relax in the sun, taking it nice and easy and stopping from time to time to take the odd photograph and ogle at the large carp swimming in the water. I liked the stepping stones placed strategically across the stream at numerous places. And underneath the bridges you could sit in the shade, read posters and signs and even enjoy a small art exhibition under one of them.At one point, way down stream, I climbed the stairs up to normal street level and discovered a large textile market. On the way back I walked at street level just to get the feel of the normal weekday hubbub. It was certainly an unusual experience to see such a peaceful stream running through the Centre of such a busy city with the normal traffic and hectic life continuing unabated at street level.Certainly a nice way to spend some down time. And I clocked up many more than my usual daily 10.000 steps making up for sitting around in planes the day before."
35,5.0,"Not much to do around here, just walking and taking pictures.. but it indeed is a beautiful place, even more beautiful at night!"
36,4.0,Very relaxing walk.....It is possible to walk up to the Han river  and there are some paintings along the walk You can always interrupt it as there are stairs or elevators in certain areas..
37,5.0,Cheonggyecheon Stream is a great spot to relax at as there are large stones under the bridge to sit on to get out of the sun or rain. There is a section lined with decorated tiles with drawings and writing on them which is a nice touch and it seems like the community got involved when cleaning up this beautiful walking route.
38,3.0,I decided to visit Cheonggyecheon Stream during a run in Seoul. It was perfect for just this - was not too busy and the terrain was faily OK and flat. When I visited they were just setting up the lanterns for the festival so they had not yet been switched on. I imagine the stream would be quite impressive when lit.
39,5.0,I visit Seoul often on business and I always walk the length of Cheongyecheon Stream. It's a lovely walk and takes you right through the heart of the city. I usually take a metro to the end and then walk all the way to City Hall.
40,5.0,Lovely for a walk day or night the area is very well lit. They also hold a lantern festival here around november time so definitely check it out well worth it and best part it's FREEEEEEE
41,3.0,"It is a stream in the city where some locals sit by, have a picnic and chat with friends. I didnâ€™t find anything particularly special about it."
42,4.0,"a nice respite away from the hustle and bustle.very peaceful.and since its underground, you dont need to worry about traffic."
43,4.0,Grab a coffee from The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf then take youself for a relaxing stroll - nice escape from the hustle and bustle above
44,3.0,"I had high expectation of this place, after reading all the reviews.  I do find it strange that no one seem to mention the foul smell along the river bank. I went there a few days ago, at last morning.  Few people were walking along the riverbank and even though I totally agree that the area is so nicely done up, I didn't enjoy the stroll as there was a light stench, which I assume, was coming from the stream. I started the walk from Jongno 2-ga station.  It was just about 5 min. from the stream.  I left after a brief 10 min. walk."
45,5.0,"Such a lovely and peaceful spot to rest during your busy sight seeing day.  After spending quite a bit of time shopping and eating in Insadong and visiting the temple across the street, I continued walking to the subway and came upon this stream.  I decided to hang out here a bit.  There were lots of people sitting by the stream.  People were reading or eating, taking photos.  There were couples on dates here, kids playing around.  There were some protestors walking around - one group anti abortion and another for it.  There was a band performing.  Basically there is a lot going on!  But it's still possible to find a quiet section along the stream as it's long.  Would definitely recommend this place."
46,5.0,"The stream is located in the center of Seoul City, near the Line 1 Subway Station from Dongdaemun Station to City Hall. It is really a nice place for walking or jogging through the autumn or spring. It is really freezing on winter so it is not recommended to go here but you can come here on summer to enjoy the fresh air. Iâ€™m not recommending you to go on jogging summer because Koreanâ€™s summer is really humid."
47,5.0,"I came here in the middle of summer and I must say I had a good time by just sitting on the bank, watching the water flow. It was therapeutic in a way. I even played on big stones on the stream to get across the other side. It's also fun to see locals who would dip their feet on the stream to refresh them. Plus points for the location, upon exit from the subway station, I easily spotted the ""unicorn"" or the entrance of the stream. The subway exit is barely a minute away from the entrance of the stream.Will I come back? Definitely. And I will recommend this to anyone going to Seoul."
48,4.0,"I went there at night and itÂ´s very interesting. It has different figures during the stream, some historic, some modern, artistic and so on. It is very long, so you can decide where you end it."
49,4.0,A nice walkway cutting east to west through the city. Peaceful. A nice walk away from the traffic. A lot of people just strolling and sitting
50,5.0,"Even if it is surrounded by markets, buildings and roads, it is actually a nice place to take a break from the bustling of the city."
51,5.0,"it is a very serene and beautiful place at night. it is a place of rich history and also a popilar dating spot for couples. It is also very near Insadong so do check it out if you want a to go to a place that is less crowded, yet insta-worthy."
52,4.0,"One way to get here is Subway line 5 - Exit 5 Gwanghwamun Station. Alternatively, if you have time, get off at City Hall Line 1 exit 1 and if you head down towards Sejong-daero you'll pass Deoksugung Doldam-gil (arguably, voted the best street in Seoul), and Deoksugung Palace.  On the right, before you get to Gwanghwamun Square, is Cheonggye Plaza and the famous stream, landmarked by what looks like a purple, spiral Xmas tree. I went at dusk, and it was very pretty with the lights.  Buskers (very good) were singing, and food stalls, which smelled delicious, were opening.  There was also trinket stalls (different from the usual tourist stuff) - it was bustling with locals (couples on a romantic walk) so the atmosphere was lovely.  A very nice way to spend an early evening.  If you continue on to Gwanghwamun Square you'll see Gyeongbokgung Palaces main gates."
53,3.0,"Maybe there isn't any festival going on, thus nothing special or no special lighting or whatsoever when I visited. Just a another canal that allows people to walk beside it and enjoy the serenity within a busy centralized city."
54,3.0,"I was in Seoul in February (a side trip while visiting the Olympics). I walked by this stream a few times, but it did not appear to be anything special. Maybe it would be worth it if you needed to waste time and there was some sort of event happening (e.g. lantern festival), or maybe it would be nicer in warmer weather. But I would say it's not necessary for your trip to Seoul."
55,3.0,The place was a bit boring when I went there at around 10am... Just the stream... Altho there were only a few people if you want to take good photos of the stream. It would be good to come here if there is any festival or if there are lights at night.
56,4.0,Beautiful small stream in Downtown. The stream will more beautiful then usual one special event such as Christmas.
57,4.0,"If u plan to shop in dongdeamum , i suggest u leave a few time to stay here, this re-new stream is a nice place to stay as a little break during ur shopping day . U can sit beside the stream n drink some coffee eat some donut or korean snacksn enjoy the sunlight in spring. U will love it."
58,4.0,"Walked along side this stream and enjoyed the walk. Also many restaurants and shops near by. towards the one end you will also find a food market, cloth market etc..."
59,4.0,This is a very cool waterway that runs along the city with a pedestrian path and great photo opportunities. Was lucky enough to make it out on my last morning in Seoul to go for a run and came along this stream which was great and also had a few benches along the way.
60,5.0,The City of Seoul did a exceptional work to beautify this stream.  It utilizes the stream as relax area for the busy city dweller.  The decoration changes often.  My visit was during X'mas time.  There are plenty of special features along the stream.  One should visit this place all the time........To relax and to see what new features they added.
61,4.0,"Seoul is a multi-faceted city with aspects of historical relic, modern technology, and maintained nature (huge mountain as a neighbor). This stream offers a nice space for a casual walk/jog alone with occasional commissioned artwork or even installations in the water for a lantern festival (November). It is also makes for a good after dinner romantic stroll if you're into that kind of thing."
62,5.0,Learn the history about the stream and you will be amaze. Clear water with birds and fishes all over the stream. Take a walk closer to the water and you will notice arts on the wall belong the stream.
63,3.0,"This place is quite quiet during winter. Everything brown and lifeless. However, it's more worth to visit here other seasons."
64,3.0,"this place some time have some special decoration, such as xmas and count down or other Korean special festival. this is the place easy to find and can take more nice photo. This place close to the main street."
65,4.0,This small stream is a very historical place. One of the former presidents renovated this place with nice decoration during his tenure as a mayor of Seoul City. you can have a pleasant walk along a stream.
66,2.0,"I don't know if I visited it in a wrong time - light night - but it was almost empty and dead.I thought that it will be a lively area, but unfortunately, it was not."
67,4.0,"Here is located in a very central place of Seoul. Along the river there is nice walking paths, with interesting decorations always. Running, walking, biking, resting are possible along this stream."
68,4.0,"A flowing stream below street level that has been developed in recent years. If you're walking east - west (or vice versa) it is a good quick, or just very relaxing way to get around (for example Insadong to Dongsaedum) and avoid the heavy traffic above. Plenty of access points with excellent signage in both Korean and English, indicating locations. Locals jog and walk here, but lots of tourists use it as well. Has been developed quite well!"
69,3.0,"Itâ€™s not really all that interesting to be honest. Itâ€™s cool that people can walk the stream that flows through the middle of a city, but I would not go out of my way to see it."
70,5.0,"I was in Seoul in July when the city government was issuing heat alerts and the stream was an amazing place to find a calm escape from the heat. Quiet and calm, you can find a shaded spot, dip your feet in the refreshing water and enjoy some wonderful people watching."
71,5.0,Make sure to visit during the lantern festival.  The place is controlled on where to enter to exit. Tiring journey.
72,4.0,"Walking along the stream is pleasant from the traffic above. Lots of people walk along here too, working adults, children, especially old people sitting and talking by the stream. I went there at night because my visit coincided with the latern festival and the stream was beautifully lit. A relaxing way to spend the time before heading to other parts of the city."
73,5.0,"Beautiful area for walking. I went here by myself (solo female traveller) and I felt completely safe.  I was there just as the sun was setting and it was gorgeous.  You can walk for ages!  Lots of people walk along here (families, young people, etc)"
74,5.0,Great place to attend to feel the mixture of modern life and nature. Beatiful view in any time -day or night and during any season.
75,4.0,"This is a lovely beauty area in the middle of the city. It was restored over ten years ago â€“ and is an environmentally great spot. There are many bridges that cross this stream. The Narae Bridge and the Gwanggyo Bridge are two of the notable bridges. The first represents a butterfly in flight â€“ and the latter symbolizes the harmony of the past and the future. There are sculptures too.The stream navigates itself past the Seoul Plaza, Insadong Street, and the Changgyeonggung Palace to name a few. Cheonggye Plaza is at the starting point of the stream. It is a happening place and many people gather here for a bit of culture and refreshments.   The stream is an ideal place to have a stroll. I would recommend it."
76,5.0,Well worth doing the walk esp at night or during any festivals very creative how it was made would recommend worth the effort
77,4.0,"This is a lovely (and long) stretch of walk by the stream with plenty of points to pause, sit, skip along the stepping stones, admire the art around etc."
78,5.0,"There used to be a raised road and a wide road under and it was all traffic and smoke and pollution.  After the demolition and then the reconstruction of an original stream it has become a  lovely place to walk, with a clean stream, plants and trees plus seasonal flowers.  It's even possible to see a few butterflies.   It is however not wheelchair accessible, having stairs down to the stream level from the road."
79,4.0,"I arrived in the late afternoon and walked the stream fro the plaza all the way to Gwangjang Market.  It is a nice place to take a stroll.   From google street view, I thought it would be decorated alot more but I think those were only for special times of the year thus only.  I stopped by the Plaza area later at night 8pm and it looked cooler lit up."
80,4.0,Was there during Christmas and the lights along this stream was so beautiful! Nice walk (especially for couples) and for photo-taking. It feels peaceful despite being near traffic. Have not tried going during daytime.
81,4.0,This lights up at night.  Very nice to walk and see the nights and the busy atmosphere.  Lots of coffee shops and restaurants nearby.  Families walking.  Wondeful.
82,4.0,"I miss the old shopping area this creek replaced, but this stream is a fun escape from the hectic city surrounding it."
83,4.0,This hood is nice. I went for dinner quite a few times around this neighborhood. You can eat really good korean bbq or fried chicken in different spots around here. I would definitely go back to this area. It is also to nice to just go for a walk and buy ice cream.
84,4.0,"I was surprised by how quiet and peaceful the Cheonggyecheon Stream (ì²­ê³„ì²œ) seemed as it is in the heart of Jung District of Seoul. I sat here for an hour, early in the morning, waiting for shops to open. It is a very clean and safe area and a great place to have a lunch outside or go for a walk."
85,4.0,Went here late in the afternoon after walking so much around Seoul. I soaked my feet on the stream and the cold water felt relaxing.
86,4.0,"C ( 17.09.15 ) There was a country lane in building area with small artificial shallow stream. There was good for walking, and had good light facility. There was nothing to special, but good place to had calm mind."
87,3.0,"Nothing much to see here.Good regeneration project but very plain, some small insects due to the stream and plants combination. Gets boring after 5 minutes."
88,5.0,It is a peaceful place. There are many trees though main roads are beside this stream. Good for taking a walk. I ran 10 km along this stream one day.
89,5.0,"The history (as explained by Young on the free walking tour from Seoul City Walking Tours) of the Cheonggyecheon and Seoul makes this walk a 'must do'. The area offers flood protection to the city and the floodgates are varied and unusual. The stream is shallow (1.5' - 2') and there are lots of picnickers, children playing and general fish-watchers. A great reprieve from the hustle and bustle of Seoul. After walking the stream (8K total distance), exploring and eating in the surrounding area, it was great to be able to soak my feet in the stream for a half hour. The water is clean and flows (after being pumped) from the Han River (30 miles away). The bridges and artwork along the walkway is a great example of Seoul history, and the power of restoration.Highly recommended - and definitely do the free tour. They won't even accept money when offered so it really is free. Try to get on the your led by Young. She's a great lady, knows her history and has a real passion for Seoul."
90,4.0,If you stay in Seoul I strongly recommend being near this stream. A great place to go and gather your thoughts. There are light and music displays at night and the area is teeming with dragonflies which is quite wanderous the first time you wander down there. The wall on the east side of the stream tells the history of a great parade that followed a similar route. A very pretty and interesting walk.
91,5.0,"Happened by this during my morning stroll.  Some areas seem more developed than others, but This area gives witness to the harmony the Koreans have with nature."
92,4.0,"I visited this place mid November when there's a light festival or something like that, where there's all kinds of display along the stream. From cartoon to cosmetic kind of display. Very beautiful to walk alone the stream at night."
93,5.0,"It is always a cozy, a convenient place in the center of Seoul city. I like to take a walk by myself, or to go with friends especially in summer!"
94,4.0,It is worth strolling along a little of this stream if you are in the area as it is a peaceful oasis hidden beneath the bustling metropolis of Seoul.
95,5.0,"A very nice area right in the city center. Had to go twice there to see it at night time as well. At day time many musicians come there and add up to the beauty of this place, at night time it lights up with many colours, there are even some laser shows."
96,4.0,The stream was a nice oasis from the hustle and bustle of Seoul streets.  Though portions being closed made going up and down a bit of a challenge.
97,5.0,We were lucky to have been in the area at the right time.  They had lanterns all along the river route and it was so beautiful!!!
98,4.0,Start at the beginning of this canal. It's in central city near the big palace. It's a nice canal....cold and clean water....you can sit and have your tired feet in the water (summer time)....and just watch ppl and life going by in Seoul while you cool down and have ice coffee....i loved it....and love walking next the water...You should have a walk on this canal....its like a song for the soul. ðŸ˜Š
99,5.0,"I see this happening more and more.  Daylighting a stream and opening it up as a break in the sea of asphalt and concrete is both the right thing to do and creates a place for humans to be.Seoul is an experience in concrete and steel and traffic, and it's a delight that the city has given up the street that used to be over this stream and created this oasis.A nice place to walk away from the noise and the cars."
100,5.0,It is quite a unique river having it located within all the high rising buildings. Very relaxing to walk around the river.
101,5.0,its hard to describe how relaxing this place is.it's amazing how the government put a peaceful and relaxing place at the heart of seoul and surrounded by offices and skyscrapers.just spent your afternoon here walking around and let the calmness of stream do the rest.wonderful
102,5.0,"Walked about 4 metro stations worth of distance. The stream is so clean there are fishes here! I didn't notice any garbage disposals available during the walk, but it's great that the population respects the environment and space. Good for all ages, there's families, elderly catching up with one another, friends, working people walking or sitting here enjoying the Sunday afternoon when I was here. Free and certainly a good break from the bustle of Seoul shopping or restaurants."
103,4.0,Beautiful stream in the middle of Seoul. Nice to stroll around and seeing people enjoying themselves. There are some stalls that sell food and stuff and it's just refreshing on a hot day in the city.
104,4.0,A nice little oasis hidden amoungst the chaos of the city. A good walk to do the whole lot but also worth just going to do partial walks as there is subway stops every few hundred metres
105,5.0,Whilst I visited during the day time the lantern displays were quite stunning. The local atmosphere was quite a buzz. At night would imagine very special.
106,5.0,I have spent some quality time there walking along the stream. This is a perfect example of how urban space can be managed in the busy sity
107,4.0,This stream with its waterfall is within walking distance from Insadong. At night the stream and the waterfall are decorated with colourful lights. There are food stalls and other stalls located along the stream (they close at around 8 pm). One could walk down to the stream and go under the stone bridge. Nice place to spend half an hour or so.
108,5.0,I started at Cheonggye Plaza near the spring sculpture (looks like a christmas tree). You can take Subway Line 5 to Gwanghwamun Station (Exit 5).and continue for 60 meters to the plaza on the left.I went at night (Saturday) and there were lots of food stalls and a market. I had a great time.
109,5.0,"It was a river steam in the 20s, where womenfolk washes similar to our Dhoby Ghaut, Singapore.A must visit and great spot for photography. On Fri.there may be carnivals or events with pop singing and entertainments."
110,3.0,"It was nice to visit this place in the evening after sun set, as the weather was cool and the place, comparatively quiet as opposed to the ground level where you hear the sounds of the traffic. A nice way to end the evening, taking an evening stroll after a hearty dinner. I entered the stream from the Dongmyo entrance, a short walk from my hotel. It took just 10 minute walk to the Dongdaemun shopping area. There is ample information in English located at the entrance/exit of each part of the stream. Although there are walking paths on both sides of the stream for parts of the entire distance, I would suggest to take the more brightly lit, paved path of the stream as there seem to be more exit points on that side."
111,4.0,Little stream running through Insadong area.  Some parts are paved others just overgrown. Nice for a walk along at night to escape the busy streets around it.
112,4.0,Done a great job of turning a potential boring waterway in to a tranquil area of a bustling city. Some intersting sculptures and nice lights at night.
113,4.0,"This was a neglected stream that ran through the Jongno-Gu area until it was given a modern makeover in 2005 to make it a pleasant walkway.  In November part of the waterway is the showcase of a spectacular lantern festival featuring historical scenes and animals,  It attracts big crowds during the evenings so choose to go at dusk or later in the evening to avoid the busiest times."
114,4.0,"A small man-made river in the heart of the city, laced with seats and planters. Go down from flight of stairs from the main street and immediately feels like away from the hustle and bustle of city life! If you like to walk, or enjoy strolling casually, this is the place to go."
115,4.0,"This is a 10.84 km long stream flowing from Gwanghwamun to Dongdamum. It has transformed into a park. Perfect place to stroll down the walking path along the stream and enjoy the night view of the area.Not only a must see place for tourists but also the local people enjoy hanging out by the stream. At night, lots lighting along the stream, beautiful! Also, there is laser light show too."
116,5.0,"I visited the stream at night for a lantern festival in November, where the large lanterns (and works of art) were installed over the stream.  I did not get to really ""see"" the stream and its features since it was dark, but it was lovely to walk along the stream and hear the rushing water and see the urban setting above the manmade stream banks.  There are some spots, especially under the overpasses where the path is very rocky and slick, so visitors should be very careful."
117,4.0,I like to go and sit there during rush hour and people watch. Not recommended during a hot humid day
118,4.0,Cheongaecheon Stream used to be highly polluted and buried under a highway but was restored starting about 12 years ago.  The river is now a major attraction for locals and visitors alike.  Although some of the water in the river is pumped from the main Han river - it also acts as a flood corridor in periods of high rainfall. The biodiversity has significantly increased in central Seoul as a result of the project and there are many cultural activities along the river.
119,4.0,"Suggest to come here around 2pm and above...the underbridge picnic was amazing, you may see some children playing with the fountain... it bring the childhood.. here near to pyeongnam mall if im not mistaken..there you get all cloths and some souvenirs at below market place...good place for bargaining."
120,4.0,"I mostly come across Cheonggyecheon the part near Dongdaemun (JW Marriot Hotel), I would prefer the part of the stream near Gwanghwamun Square."
121,4.0,If you visit Seoul in summer then i suggest you visit here because the breeze will make you feel cozy and comfortable.
122,5.0,You can join the stream at various points along its way. I have walked the first sections (steps 1-7) and it was a pleasant stroll. They have added interesting little changes along its course so it is not just a straight through stream and there are some decorations on the walls. Even under one of the bridges was a photo exhibition.
123,4.0,"Got to the eastern part of this stream (going east-west and it's below the ground level) in late evening at about 8 pm but found the stairway locked so I wasn't able to go down; in any case, viewing from above, it did look pretty good with absolutely clean-looking water and a clean walkway along each of the the two sides (or just on one side in some places with trees on the other side) and also some stones placed in the water (to cross the stream from one side to the other at various points) all of which can be seen quite clearly after dark with all the lights on the wall alongside the walkway on each side of the stream as far as the eyes can see (I suppose it's brightly lit up like that for all of its approximately 11 km!).And just on the north side of the Stream at the part where I was is the Great East Gate (Heunginjimun) which is the biggest of all six city gates of Seoul (I got to three of them) and which is also beautifully lit up after dark; and after crossing back the Stream to its south side from the East Gate, I was really delighted to go through Dongdaemun Night Market with mobile kiosks spread out here & there along the sidewalk on one side of the big Jangchungdan-ro street all the way to its intersection with Eulji-ro street where there's the big Lotte Department Store (some other department stores as well in that night market area between the Stream to the north & the big intersection to the south).With proximity to I'm sure a number of metro stations along its ""great length"", the closest station to the part of the Stream near the East Gate (the part that I got to as mentioned above) is Dongdaemun History & Culture Park (on Lines 2, 4 & 5) from which it's just about a 10-minute walk north along Jangchungdan-ro where you'll go through Dongdaemun Night Market in the evening (as mentioned above) on the way to the Stream."
124,4.0,Visit Cheonggyecheon when it is holiday season! They have pretty lights up so you can get a lot of pretty pictures along the stream. It can get crowded at times but it's not that busy. I've seen a lot of couples walking along the stream and families hanging out here so it's quite safe. Visit if you have spare time!
125,5.0,"When I went here, there were only a few people around so I was able to enjoy the silence. Really nice place to go and chill. Probably not recommended for winter, but still a nice open-space area to hang out at."
126,5.0,From the map it might seem like it is quite a walk away from the nearby subway but actually it is less than 10 mins walk from Dongdaemun Design Plaza. The place is quite picturesque and there's many locals as well as tourists enjoying their walks there.
127,4.0,"I came across the stream while walking south from the palaces.  I took the stairs down and turned right and just strolled along.  when I first went down the stairs there were murals of horses and as you walk along they play the sounds of horses walking.  I ended up walking t the end (or the beginning)  there were water falls and when you go upstairs you are on a main street and you can look down  and see the palace. there are many shopping and eating opportunities here.  after a while I walked back down the stairs and went back the way I came from.  There are little places that you can cross the stream  with bricks...  this place is crowded at the beginning with families, tourists... but once you walk along it thins out.  I don't knowhow far the trail goes but I walked about 2 hours and never came to the other end.  it started getting dark so I headed back.  this place is very clean and very safe.  A great place to go walking jogging, running...  it is very peaceful  NOTE that there are several places to enter and exit the stream so make sure you look to see where you entered so you can exit there. at nigh the stream lights up along the stream so it is very safe"
128,3.0,"I remember the path of the Cheonggyecheon Stream as a raised motorway when I first visited Seoul over 20 years ago. I had heard much about how the stream has been cleaned and transformed, and was finally able to visit. If you're nearby Sejong-dero/City Hall or Dongdaemun, it's easy to stroll to the stream for a picture or two. You can walk the entire distance between these two tourist areas by following the stream. As a bonus, you won't have any traffic lights and you're a bit removed from the car exhaust.While it is picturesque, Cheonggyecheon Stream itself is not that impressive. While the stream is clean it is not natural at all. The water is pumped from somewhere else and the areas along the stream are very manicured. If you are nearby, walk over and stroll for a few blocks. If you make visiting the stream the focus of your day you will be disappointed."
129,5.0,Great place to walking for relax in the busy city. You'll see street performers and small exhibition under the stream.
130,5.0,"I love being able to walk the stream in the middle of the city.  Nature gives me peace so walking along the river gives me clarity and room to breathe.  I've been here in the summer and it's pleasant.  I've also been here on Christmas Day and while it's packed, the lights are really beautiful and I'd do it again!"
131,5.0,It will take awhile to explore the whole stretch of this stream but I think it's nice to try if you have the time. I visited this during winter and the spring season which has a different feel each time I visited. This is near the train station and close to the other tourist attractions at the end of the stream.
132,4.0,"Even in winter, Cheonggyecheon stream is attractive in its own way. I didn't feel like I'm in one of the busies cities in the world. There was a real stork ?? It's unbelievable, at least for me :DThere are also many shopping centers nearby  when you want to get back to the modern city.Nice experience to try."
133,5.0,"You will find this very nice (and controversial) artificial stream in the middle of downtown Seoul, guarded from chaotic traffic and noise, like an oasis. I visited the stream at night during summer. There were many couples seating on both the banks; some were soaking their feet in it, and some were even having snacks. You will feel totally refreshed by just being there.You can walk as long as you want, amid a spectacle of lights, a waterfall, some vegetation, and the darkness under bridges and overpasses."
134,4.0,Good quiet stroll made even better if you can catch the Seoul Lantern Festival. All of the lanterns were impressive and had plaques describing the meaning behind all of the scenes/sculptures. There were a lot as well. It's a good place to go after checking out the palace. You can get some rest here before moving on.
135,5.0,"There are so many things happening along the various sections of the stream.I walked from Station 3 near Bosingak (check the tourist map, there are various stations along the stream) to Pyeonghwa Market. It's a nice, long walk.Keep going up and down, because the sights are sometimes right alongside the stream, like the mural showing the procession of King Jeongjo, or up on the bridges (a tribute to some poet, whose name I don't remember).There's a grey heron living on the stream. He's very friendly, so be careful with your movements. He walked right up to me as I took photos of the mural.It's a sight that's more peaceful during the day, as there are a lot of people chilling there in the evening."
136,2.0,I found this place leaving the dongdaemun design plaza.  I only viewed the canal from the upper level and did not walk along the canal.  Not much to see and do here
137,5.0,"Did the riverside walk a few times, at day time and in the evening. I was fortunate to see the  festival when they place thousands of glowing paper and paint sculptures in de water."
138,5.0,"The canal is well designed and serves as city drainage system and also recreation park together. There is less people around in the morning, very peaceful."
139,4.0,"Cheonggyecheon stream is a rest place in the middle of the city. from Gwanghwamun station, exit 9. you will see the King Sejong statue in front of you, and Admiral Yi Sun Shin statue behind you. walk pass the Admiral statue, until you see the snail-like thing (hehe) in blue and red color. next to it the Cheonggyecheon stream. just take a rest there after a long walk."
140,5.0,It's amazing that a slightly lowered section can be this peaceful in the middle of Seoul. It features art and natural sights and can even be compared to New York's High Line. It's that good!
141,5.0,"Beautiful stream of water running in the middle of a busy neighbourhood. Beautiful plants and some artificial waterfalls nicely made. It is a relaxing walk, watching skyscrapers while listening to the stream of water. Whoever made it, this had a Brilliant idea!"
142,4.0,"I went there at night time. I only saw a short stretch of the stream, but I definitely appreciate the appeal. It's a nice peaceful place to hang out, but all sorts of shops are ready on the sides for you to head to when you're done sightseeing."
143,4.0,"All things created from Asia is cute and here in Seoul, couple centered. This attraction is no different. This man made river in the middle of Seoul its designed to bring romance and lovers together. Lots of places to sit and enjoy. Especially on a warm summer's night, you will find tons of young college couples sitting and flirting everywhere. Although, this does serve as one of the main thoroughfares for carrying water out of the city for monsoon season. So stay away. The man made river will fill up some 10-15 feet of rushing water when the rains come. The yearly Buddha lantern festival is also held here in May. Come look at the intricate lanterns with the crowd of photographers and their huge cameras trying to capture all the beauty. This can be accessible from many points since it flows through the city center."
144,5.0,"The open air stream flows below street level through the heart of Seoul and is an ideal refuge from the hub hub and traffic above. Many people sit along the banks, some cooling their feet in the water, and enjoying the peace. It makes for a very pleasant walk from one part of the city to anotherThe stream has several waterfalls, cascades and stepping stone to cross from one side to the other. The area also houses many innovative art installations and is very pretty when illuminated after darkVisitor amenities and information are excellent"
145,4.0,"It starts from cheonggye square on the sejong street. It's a long stream with the walking paths that are both sides of the stream so people is able to sit on the benches and relax or jogging or taking a walk. It reaches many street markets such as kwangjang, Bangsan and pyeonghwa etc. So you can taste the many korean foods!!"
146,3.0,Good place to walk around. There is nothing much to do here. If you have spare time you can walk alongside the stream. Otherwise you can do a quick photo stop.
147,5.0,Night time is get crowded specially in hot days. Is about 10km long it take about 1-2 hours to walk back and fourth.
148,5.0,"This is an amazing waterway right in the heart of a concrete jungle - excellent pongsu.  It provides an oasis away from the vehicles and hustle and bustle of everyday life.  Cafes and tourist information is in easy reach as you walk along.  Cool your feet, make a wish and enjoy the greenery as you go at your own pace.  Very restful and relaxing."
149,4.0,Loved hearing the birds and seeing the clear beautiful stream. Close walk from the design plaza. Would love to see it in November for the lantern festival.
150,4.0,"I happened onto the Stream area while wandering around the center city on a summer evening. As I was in Seoul for the first time and was staying in Gangnam-gu, I thought I'd take the subway one evening to see what I might see. Lots of people were out, children playing in the fountains, and dramatic lighting of the old palaces. By chance, I came across the stream -- very peaceful and pleasant, a perfect reflection of the general ambience."
151,4.0,"The renewal of the Cheonggyechon Stream was part of a massive urban beautification project in the early years of this millennium. It's a great place to wander and enjoy the views, occasional live music and people enjoying a little nature in the heart of the busy city."
152,5.0,"As a redeveloped area from a traffic bridge to a lovely stream this place is a total success in urban design from my point of view, it is interesting with different focal point along the way, better to visit it at night to see the dancing lasers and enjoy the lights, visit in May to enjoy the Buda lantern festival too."
153,5.0,"I have wanted to come to Cheonggyecheon Stream for years and it was well worth the wait. It's such a beautiful spot, I found myself coming here daily during my stay. It's a great place to walk, run or relax. It's one of the most peaceful area's within Seoul and also has some interesting history attached to it.The longer you walk, the more you discover. I recommend everyone who visits Seoul, take the time to come here as you won't regret it."
154,5.0,"It is very unique to have tranquil clean stream with lush greenery in the middle a busy, bustling Seoul. It has a feel of a country side stream yet has that wow factor. Was lucky that my hotel was just a shot walk to the stream so i went there several times in the day and night. Unfortunately it was in the middle to a hot summer week so i didn't spend a lot of time there. I can imagine one spending a lot of time there when the weather is cooler. I know that the Korean government spent a lot of money to rejuvenate this forgotten stream and I must say money well spent!"
155,4.0,"Cool place during the day, and beautiful still when lit up at night.  Lucky enough you may come across the lantern display on the river (one in November). No matter if you are by yourself, with your friends or family, there is always something interesting to see along the river course."
156,1.0,"Maybe my opinion would be different if I walked there in the evening, but when the sun is up, it's really nothing special. I went there solo, so maybe one gets a different impression when holding hands with their partner ðŸ˜Š"
157,2.0,"One of the two famous rivers of Seoul. When I was there it was raining often, but the view of this river is not special at all. It is made by humans, but in my country (Netherlands) the rivers and canals are much better then this. Not a must go in my opinion"
158,5.0,"This place is very popular in seoul, at night this place very crowded with people, most of them couple. Also there is some street musician playing live music, very relaxing and romantic place. You can feel the water stream to and very beautiful light."
159,3.0,a lovely story for seoul but during the day its really nothing. find it in the evening to see it in its glory
160,5.0,"If you're in downtown in the evening, I highly recommend this park. Just a long stream through the city. But so well done! It meanders below street level. So you seem to enter a different world as you descend the few meters on the paths on either side of the stream. Art work abounds. And in Spring/Summer/Fall you will hear live music along the stroll. A bit cooler, quieter, fresher air. Enjoy."
161,5.0,It was really nice place during the World lantern festival and really good to walk down the road in summer. It's really cool during the evening and night.
162,4.0,I went there on the last day of my Seoul trip and took a walk along the side.It is a nice place for relaxing and hanging out with friends.
163,4.0,"A wonderful quiet stream that is good for a walk in the bustle of the city, sit down under a bridge and soak your tired feet in the stream. Appreciate the green and the murals decorating the walls, if you're lucky you'll catch a drama being filmed along its banks."
164,5.0,"Day or at night - simply a beautiful relaxing place to sit and enjoy life. If you don't want to walk alongside cars anymore it is a very nice change. Locals seem to highly enjoy it as well, especially once it gets dark people seem to automatically be drawn to this romantic and beautiful place."
165,4.0,"Interesting place come for relaxing, enjoy Seoul at different view. You can try your luck by tossing the coin to the hole in the middle of the stream. I tried, it almost went to the hole but didnt :D"
166,5.0,"I found this place while walking around with my map and had wanted to see it.  I live in Los Angeles and it is an example that the LA River Revitalization folks use as an example of what can be done!  Loved this place!  There was cool public art along the way, you could hear the water flowing, all the greenery was fresh, and there were places to sit along the way.  I just love the whole idea of this place and wished I could have stayed longer!"
167,4.0,"A very pleasant walk along this canal type stream.  Modern, clean and attractive.  Takes about 1 hour or so.  Great!"
168,4.0,Cheonggyecheon Stream used to be a polluted area until the city decided to clean it up about 10 years ago.  The stream is a great place to walk.  You can make the walk as long as you want since it's a little less than 7 miles long.  There are some food vendors on the Gwahwamun Square side of the stream if you are hungry.  You'll see quite a few people sitting at the stream talking with their friends/significant other.  It's definitely worth a visit when you go to Seoul.
169,5.0,I visit both during the day and night and both were amazing.  I first visited during the day and walked about a mile of the stream then visited at night when all the lights are on and it was breath-taking.  If you have the opportunity sign-up for the walking tours offered by the Tourism office and you will get to learn a lot about the history of the stream.  I had the pleasure of meeting a great guide on my tour who was an older retired gentlemen that remembered the history of the stream and the evolution of how it came to be what it is today which was very nice.
170,4.0,"I was running along the place (ca. 3 km long the interesting area) and is a nice place for a walk, full of decoration in the riverside and with nice stones fit cruising the river and places for sitting and relaxing"
171,4.0,"This is an easy to find and  lovely spot for a short stroll  in the evening, but especially when the lantern festival ""floats"" are being stored here."
172,4.0,"A refreshing respite and walk that is a setting for unexpected art installations.  Beautifully lit at night, seeing young and old strolling below street level."
173,4.0,Nice place for couple walk around there and also you could see the nice view at night and it is really special design. I could find the nice floral around the place.
174,4.0,"This is a gem.  A storm water drain that has been transformed into a cool , quiet getaway.  Four metres below street level it is a quiet , cool place to walk or sit.  A landmark when exploring wonderful Seoul, it is attractive and practical."
175,5.0,"If you're a first-time visitor in Seoul that has more than just a few days on hand, I would recommend spending at least some part of a day strolling along this canal. It's a very pleasant walk and a nice break from the busy city. You can enter and exit at various points, so it's a great way to get from one neighborhood to the next while taking in some sights and seeing the locals. There's a lot of resting spots along the way, so it's also great for meeting a friend, getting some coffee, and having a nice talk. Such calm and peaceful places in Seoul should not be missed."
176,5.0,This stream area can get crowded at times but on a hot day it was a welcome relief to take my shoes off and cool down on the banks of the stream. As I walked around I met many friendly Koreans and fellow tourists. I spotted various wildlife and really enjoyed the serenity of the area. It has many access points and is near several metro stops. It makes it accessible and convenient to spend some time in this area.
177,5.0,Was in Seoul on a long layover so I decided to hit the downtown area to do some exploring. I walked along the long stretch of this famed urban park and had a really great time people watching and admiring the modern Seoul skyline. Allot at least two hours to enjoy the scenery and take it all in.
178,4.0,"You can talk a short or a long walk close to the Cheonggyecheon river. Since it is under the street level, you won't see cars and street's noises are reduced."
179,5.0,It was a hot day when I & my friend visited this place. Managed to find a cool spot to sit & chill out. Soaked our bare feet in the water & it was a very relaxing afternoon.
180,4.0,This walk offers peace and tranquility in the heart of the city. A great idea.Come during the day and night to experience the contrasts. The stream is lit up at night.
181,5.0,This is more than just a relaxing place/stream in the heart of Seoul. I recently learnt 2 pieces of history within the area-world largest ceramic banchado recording king jongjo's visit to suwon hwaseong. You won't be able to spot the king as backin the days you are now allowed to draw the face of the king! A piece of tomb was removed from queen sindeok by the stepson as a revenge and the face of queen sindeok was upside down! How better to learn all these history than reading on books!!!
182,4.0,Enjoyed taking late afternoon stroll here although lots of students snd people from work come to this place around that time. There are food stalls and along the street are several food places too.
183,4.0,This stream features huge paper statues and colorful lights at the night a very nice way to relax and have few memorable pictures hereIts near Insadong so you can walk to another shopping district
184,4.0,It really pleasant to walk along Cheonggyechon stream as it is a really quiet place compare to the shopping streets just nearby.
185,5.0,"Went there a late September evening with a friend. Its extremly cozy, even though there can be a lot of people it's not annoying. Great place to take your date for a walk!"
186,5.0,Just went on a Sunday morning run before I had to leave for the airport. Excellent place for running and takes you straight through the city. From city center through the outskirts.
187,4.0,Best to be there during evening and night time for a relaxing stroll after you are done for the day. Lots of locals sitting along the stream chatting and having drinks.
188,5.0,"If you arrive in Seoul than a walk along Cheonggyecheon Stream it's definitely a must. It's a very nice break from the noisy, tiring Seoul. The Stream crosses from Est to west the central Seoul, it's easy to reach by foot and along you might find even birds, like ducks and cranes, and different species of fish. It's easy to cross the town and avoid the busy, dusty and noisy streets in the summertime. Last, the area closer to the center and Myeongdong district and Gyeongbokgung Palace it's a very nice and pretty iconic urban plaza."
189,4.0,"Amazing by the night, and each bridge over the stream has a different water formation and a nice place to sit by with a bottle of wine or coffee. It's one of those sites that make Seoul so different from other cities. Must visit and spend some quiet time by the water!"
190,5.0,"Nice walk along the river. This used to be a motorway until it was turned back into its original shape, i.e. a little stream. Walkways on either side, some artists, artwork etc."
191,4.0,I think it is a nice place for couples to take a stroll down the stream and enjoy the slower pace despite it being in the heart of the city. There were many couples (therefore my conclusion that it's a nice place for couples) and the stream is really quite long. It was night when I was there but there were still many people. And the area was beautifully decorated and lit with Christmas lights.
192,4.0,"If you're not in a hurry it's well worth the time to stroll down the stream. Fishes, murales and stepping stones make for a nice and varied walk."
193,4.0,"I went here twice! The night time view has the surrounding lights reflecting in the water and the ends of the stream look dazzling. In the daytime, come here to see the fish and enjoy a snack by the riverside. At almost all hours of the day you'll find locals walking by the riverbank."
194,5.0,I liked it. It was soothing to hear rushing water amid the hustle and bustle of the city and it was interesting to people watch and see the sunset and the light installations.
195,4.0,"A very relaxing stroll which cuts through the center of a very big city. Cheonggyecheon stream offers peace and quiet and places to sit and relax. A very artsy place with light shows at certain places, it's nice to see it during the day time and it's even better during the night. See it both during the day and night. You won't be disappointed."
196,3.0,Pleasant and quite original for a stroll downtown. I must admit this has been very nicely made and the place is quite attractive. This being said it is still stream in between 2 concrete walls.... so don't expect a world marvel!
197,5.0,good place to walk along the river to get from one location to the next or to just enjoy a drink or snack along the river and people watch.
198,4.0,A reclamation of public space in an Asian capital. I benefitted more as I took a local Royal Asiatic Society Walk which gave us the municipal history of this traffic jam area and how this stream was thought of.
199,4.0,Overlooking the stream and it is such a nice place to visit at night. The surroundings adds to beauty and vibrant of the place.
200,3.0,The stream has been opened up some time ago to make place for a walkway on the streamlevel (one level down from the normal street level). Makes for a nice walk if you want to forget a bit about the hectic traffic.
201,5.0,"It's best to visit Cheonggyecheon stream at night as that's when the lightings will light up and it's super nice and romantic to take a stroll here after your dinner! The stream is long but it's also connected to nearby places such as Myeongdong, Cityhall and Dongdaemun. Recommended to visit regardless whether you're alone or with someone!"
202,3.0,"Walked past the Cheonggyechoen Stream on my way to Dongdaemun.  It was winter and it was during the day, so no lights and it looked ordinary, nothing special.  Maybe this is the less prettier part of the stream? I can see even this part of the stream would look a lot nicer during the warmer months."
203,5.0,"The daylighting of Cbeonggyecheon stream was a impressive feat of urban planning and took incredible foresight from Seoul. Today you can enjoy a short stroll along a section or turn into a day tour by waking the entire length and stopping to check out sights just off its trail- I found it so tranquil and relaxing to listen to the stream bubble away and followed it as it got bigger, watching ducks play and spotting the occasional fish ... Great for a stroll, run, family outing or just quiet contemplation... A break from the big city!!"
204,5.0,I visited here in winter over Lunar New Year and it was very quiet (although there is reasonably unobtrusive piped music along the way).  It's a little colder than the street level but it was peaceful and pleasant to walk along and I can imagine other times of the year and at night it would be a lovely promenade.  Might be good if you had children and you wanted to let them walk freely without any risk of traffic (the stream is not too deep and has lots of stepping stones in it - so be careful if they are prone to water play).  I was warned that it is also used as a flood release so be aware if it has been raining a lot!
205,4.0,"Is a nice change of pace from the rest of cbd Seoul. But definitely better to go at night, with the lights on than to go during the day"
206,5.0,the in ground stream the runs between the sides of the road.  There are often events at the stream and many things to do.
207,5.0,I recommend to visit it in the night and before you sit there you should a get cup of coffee and enjoy with nice view.
208,4.0,"A beautiful place at night that I love visiting whenever I'm in Gwanghamun Don't miss out because it's nice The lantern festival is beautiful too, but be prepared for a huge crowd I suggest taking time to walk the whole trip to the end Start from gwanghamun and walk down to the end"
209,5.0,"Take a stroll down the stream at night,there are some shops around. The christmas decoration is beautiful."

212,5.0,"I walked to this stream from Chandeukgung Palace. Since its Christmas, there are many decorations and setting would be pretty during the night. A great place to stroll and enjoy the view. Its quite a long walk if you want to walk from one end to the other end. And you can throw coins into the stream and make a wish"
213,4.0,"This place is good especially nice view when we come in the night. The light beside of this river can make this river so wonderful. This river so long, so you can reach from some subway station. I came from dongdaemun station after shopping."
214,5.0,"I just love this place, by day or night. Walked all the way up until the clothes shopping district. It is sooo nice, every big city should have something like that. Thank you Seoul!"
215,5.0,Relaxing stream through central Seoul beautiful anytime of year. There are often decorations and themes depending on the season. In the summer relax and put your feet in!
216,4.0,The stream is very clean and refreshing. There are spot where we can soak our feet and enjoy the relaxing water massage. There are also a lot of restaurant near the area and sometimes there are also art performances.
217,2.0,I visited here on a rainy November day. I think this might be more or a summer attraction a it was mainly wet and grey when I visited.
218,5.0,"My hostel was located on the east end of Cheoonggyecheon. So I decided to walk all the way to the west end, which was next to Gwuangdaemun. I saw people riding bicycles, jogging or wondering around just like me. The water was so clean that I could see fishes swimming, and some fishes were quite big. The birds were flying around and hiding in those brushes.  I felt so relaxed and spent the whole morning there. I would like to  back for night time scenery next time traveling to Seoul."
219,4.0,"By day or night, this stream offers a great place to escape the city's hustle and bustle.You will find many people wondering around there, and some couple exhibiting, what the local refer to as: PDA (Public Display of Affection). I found this great.If you have time, this place is not to be missed, for sure."
220,5.0,"It's a great idea to create a calm oasis in hectic part of the city. It is always a cool place when it is hot. It's a great place anytime, but it exceptionally cosy on weekends when families ramble there all the day, children jump over stone bridge and everybody smiles."
221,3.0,"I visited twice on my travels to Seoul, once at night in the rain and once during the sunny daytime. Both times I was left a bit underwhelmed. I don't know what I was expecting but it just didn't have the wow factor I was expecting. It's a nice walk if you're in the area but there's not that much else to do there."
222,4.0,"The lantern festival just started today. Really cool lanterns, such as of the palaces and other tourist attractions.  I liked it better than I thought I would. It's a unique thing to see.  Check it out!"
223,4.0,"I went here after visiting Changdeokgung Palace, InsaDon, and Gyeongbokgung Palace. I love the place and it's good that left this site for an evening visit. Yes, I have to admit, it was a bit cold but there are a lot of cafes around the area where you can get a good cup of coffee. You take it with you while you're walking around the place. I love the lighting in the stream. I also love the laser shows they have set-up as you walk further down the stream."
224,4.0,Nice atmosphere.You can walk along the stream and sometime it has lantern festival in every November.
225,4.0,At first I find it hard to locate the stream since i was lost. It was a beautiful and relaxing stream. this is a very good initiative to convert such place into an attraction
226,5.0,Beautiful recreation and very relaxing area in the hurt of the busy city. You can do the a walking tour from the canal to the food market
227,5.0,"I traveled alone and it was a very beautiful stream, like most things in Seoul.  In the early morning you can see people go through their morning routines of walking to work or running for exercise. At night be ready for the sea of couples because it is a very romantic place to be at night, and while being solo wasn't bad, I'm positive the experience would have been amazing as a couple."
228,5.0,You can enjoy a long walk especially at night. Many people and couples... nice lighting along with water fall. In October they had some art exhibition.
229,5.0,"This is a LONG stream that's situated below the roads of Seoul, and makes it an ideal walking path for many locals and tourists walking from one end of Seoul to another with exits along the journey. The stream was filled with many recyclable art which gives the stream a perception of urban lifestyle that may not necessarily be in sync with the serenity one would expect walking along the stream.  I would highly recommend anyone visiting Seoul for the 1st time to take a walk to experience it."
230,5.0,"Through the hustle and bustle that is Seoul, you may want to get away from the insanity for a little bit. Cheonggyecheon stream provides that escape in the middle of a busy area of Seoul. You take a set of stairs down to the stream and it feels as though the world above simply melts away. During the annual lantern festival in February you can see many beautiful lanterns, both large and small, along the stream. The stream is within walking distance of the Museum of Art."
231,5.0,"At least four times per week, I ride my bicycle on the bike path that comprises the last few kilometers of Cheongyecheon before it runs into Jungnangcheon and finally the Han River. This path is but a tiny part of a huge system of recreational spaces in Seoul that may be unique in the world for their abundance, diversity of activities, and popularity. It's hard to say what I enjoy most about this--the bird life, observing the people of all ages and classes partaking of sports and fitness activities, the greenery, etc., etc., etc."
232,3.0,"A visionary mayor decided to make lemonade out of a lemon and turned what was once a dried up drainage ditch into a cool respite in Seoulâ€™s frenetic city center.  The start is near the city hall side of Seoul, where there is a grid of bubbling fountains - the water from which immediately drops, waterfall-style, to the actual water level of the stream.At no point should you mistake this for a natural setting.  It is strictly a concrete construct but, nevertheless, it has its distinct charms.  Up near the start of the stream there are more exhibitions and events, whereas downstream it is strictly utilitarian.With the concrete, shade and water comes coolness, which a definite plus when the temperatures become uncomfortable at street level.  Theyâ€™ve done their best to add elements of nature with shrubbery, river bed stones and schools of little fish.  But, along with these things come pesky, gnat-like insects which will swarm you if you are near the water and stationary.  So itâ€™s not a good place to plan a leisurely, waterside lunch or romantic interlude.This stream is best enjoyed during a stroll along the concrete paths on either side, at night-time as well as daytime, although it can be enjoyed equally from street level, particularly at night or when there are special events.Taken for what it is â€“ an urban renewal project â€“ it is a perfectly nice place.  It really shouldnâ€™t be taken more seriously than that."
233,5.0,Lovely walks during the day and morning. Seoul at night offers a different perspective for the travelers.
234,5.0,"I can't believe a major city has something so pretty as this canal running through it! Walk along it in the late afternoon and you'll see heaps of people out strolling, maybe doing street performances etc. Just lovely atmosphere, in summer anyway, and it's near major shopping areas so probably not going out of the way to visit it."
235,5.0,Loved walking along this stream at night....lots of street musicians and the night is alive with all the people!
236,5.0,"When I first walked onto the stream I thought what was so special - overgrown trees and plants.  When I walked down further I change my mind.  Great to see couples out, buskers, little projections.  Really pleasant walk on a nice night."
237,4.0,"The title basically says it all :-). You can spend 2-3 hours walking along a stream, enjoying cool breezes and nature, in the middle of a huge city. I think its especially nice in the morning and in the evening."
238,5.0,"i started from the east and walked all the way to the other side, it was a long but worth it walk. i remember seeing a lot of local people chilling under the bridges etc.. closer to the myeoundong area you will see more activities. for example i saw school kids doing some art class and i see that the korean kids are really talented (more so than their western cousins) and they are more into culture and tradition and understand their country than say London (which is where I'm from)."
239,5.0,"I've never seen a single stream that can vitalize the entire city except for Cheonggyecheon. It just felt so cheerful to dip your feet into the clean water and watch the stream flow. I believe the white-collar guys in the office buildings and embassies beside the stream totally love it as well. When it rains heavily you do not get an access, but standing on the bridge observing the current is still pretty satisfying."
240,4.0,"The Cheonggyecheon Stream cuts through a large swath of the city west to east. There's typically a lot of activity on the far western end where the stream starts (when I was there there was a Thai festival). Once you walk down the stream a way it is much quieter. People sit under the bridges in the shade eating and socializing. It's a good place to people watch and to transact the city on foot. There's no need to walk the entire length, but stopping by a small portion makes for a nice respite in a busy city."
241,4.0,"I went for a walk and unexpectedly found the stream. The area was pleasant and a lovely break from the mad traffic of Seoul. I spent time just walking along it totally away from the busyness of the city. The fact that it was raining lightly did not detract from it, but if it had been fine I may have walked further."
242,5.0,"Ever get sick of the noise and crowds? Walk the stream and you'll feel like you've been transported to the countryside for a breif afternoon. It's quiet, cool, and leafy. The stream is clean and clear so feel free to splash around or enjoy a picnic with your feet in the water."
243,3.0,Cheonggyecheon Stream is an artificial stream. But it doesn't smell bad. It has great decoration too. But you would bump into a lot of street seller
244,5.0,"Some city redevelopment projects get criticised because they're just so costly.  But when the end result turns out to be all it promised and more, the locals generally get behind it with pride.  Even though it doesn't get as much attention as say, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Rocks district in Sydney, or The High Line in New York City, I would say that Cheonggyecheon ranks up with the biggies in terms of its importance to the city.  Taking a seriously neglected stream that was in serious danger of being forgotten and turning it into a downtown park attraction took plenty of cash and serious political will.  But it's now an oasis of calm amid the traffic just several metres above head level.  Indeed, some sections are actually pretty.  Whatever your reasons for taking a stroll, take as little time as you need, or as much as you like, as the walking path next to the stream is just short of 11 kilometres long.  Check out the little creeks and water displays, as well as the tiled walls that depict images from Korea's dynastic history.  And the start of the stream, a fountain operates most of the day and is nicely lit up after dark.  Needless to say, it's a good place to bring kids for a walk."
245,4.0,I was getting a little hot from all the walking in Insadong so I decided to just relax here.  It was nice to sit under one of the bridges to cool off.  It seems most students do the same.  It was still relaxing even though there were a lot of students.
246,5.0,Great for people watching or an evening walk. Very interesting at night when parts are lit up and locals are walking and relaxing by the edge.
247,4.0,"Not worth it's own trip, but there's a good chance you'll come upon Cheonggyecheon while you're walking around Seoul. It's easy to run across it and then just go down and walk along it for a while on the way to your destination, a pleasant alternative to the sidewalk!"
248,5.0,"Yes, i was very impressed with this place which has been made with their great effort. once Got history of this stream, it was so dirty and people agitate to cross around the area. But now it is lovely place to get a rest in the bank of the stream. There are beautiful flowers blowing here and there. It is really a great place."
249,5.0,"I was skeptical about how interesting a restored stream could possibly be, but upon visiting I was blown away by what the Seoul Government has achieved. The Stream is simply breathtaking with waterfalls, stepping stone crossings, wishing wells and green spaces which make you feel as if you are in the countryside despite the hustle and bustle of the city above you. It is a great place to escape the heat during hot summer days and I had a great time wandering around for 30 mins taking it all in. A nice stop if you can squeeze it into your itinerary."
250,3.0,"I tend to like more historical or 'natural' places, so this wasn't my favorite stop in Korea.  We did enjoy the Chinese Lantern display for Buddha's Birthday, so if you're in Korea in May it's a great place to stop at night. Otherwise, try to visit the river in the more remote areas-not the heart of Seoul near City Hall-where everything (including the river) is just concrete."
251,5.0,I love this stream. It is so peaceful at night and so romantic. You will see friends and couples having a walk along the banks. Towards the end of the year there is a lantern festival which is so beautiful but busy! A must if you're in Seoul at night.
252,4.0,"I love the stream! Seoul is a city of concrete and neon lights, but the nature is never far away, like this place. It's perfect to walk down there, take of your shoes and cool down a little bit. And it's really pretty in the evening too!"
253,4.0,A re-constructed area running through the middle of Seoul - a fantastic place to stroll and see some lovely areas of the city.  It is well worth the visit and you could easily spend the afternoon here.
254,5.0,"This is right in the middle of the city & a lovely place to walk day or evening. You don't want to miss out on this relaxing stroll. There are quite a few steps to get down to the pathway along the river, not really suited for handicapped or strollers."
255,5.0,I love strolling down Cheonggyecheon. Night or day it doesn't matter. It is a great way to get from City Hall to Gwangjang Market and then to Dongdaemun. So many photo ops.
256,5.0,"This makes for a pleasant stroll through the bustling heart of the city.  The stream is bordered by an interesting variety of greenery and here you see the locals enjoying themselves. You can pop up and down to the bustling streets and short intervals, and it is a quiet oasis; take a paper bag lunch and eat on the banks."
257,5.0,"The stretch of Cheonggyecheon Stream near City Hall is a really lovely park, but honestly I would suggest walking along it anywhere.  Once I walked it from Gwanghwamun to Seoul U, and it was fantastic (but it took me the whole day).  Always worth a visit when you're in the city."
258,5.0,"If I were Korean I would be very proud of the place. I am an engineer and an urban environmentalist always pursuing the concept of livable city. As an engineer I take pride with this great achievement: the combination of political will and good city planning and engineering.Go visit the place, and breathe in the air, enjoy the flora and urban fauna. If you take yourself back a decade a go it was a closed, urban sewer. Kudos Korea!!! Kudos Seoul. With this, Seoul gets back its lost souls."
259,4.0,"Stepping down into the Stream (because I cannot pronounce the name) is like stepping through the wardrobe into Narnia. Upside a busy city, downside as calmness, freshness and coolness that is palpable. If Seoul is proving bit much for you at any time then this is the place to head to. Find City Hall and keep walking along in that direction, you'll find it!"
260,5.0,you can do it from myendong for about 2 kilometers...long and nice walk you can go downstairs to take pics...but if go in the summer time...prepare to be bite...or protect yourself with mosquitoes repelent...have fun.
261,5.0,"This is one place that you cannot afford to miss in Seoul. From Changdeokgung Palace, Myeongdong, or Insadong, or anywhere in Seoul - this is the place to take off your shoes, dip your feet into the stream and relax. I went to Cheongyecheon at least twice and sat there (after hours of exploring Seoul by foot, once in the late afternoon, once at night), loved the view and just sitting there, experiencing one of the daily activities of Seoulites. I wish we had one stream like this in our place :D"
262,5.0,"What a great place to walk and de-stress.  I found this was a great jumping off point to see Seoul.  I love the stream itself but i also liked going topside and wandering around the neighborhoods it meanders through.  You are not far from great attractions like Gwanghwaman plaza at the west end all the way to Ogansugyo Bridge at the east end.  Walk the length if you can but get up out of the stream and see Seoul, Both its tourist areas and its working neighborhoods.  Knowing I wasn't far from the stream gave me the security of not being lost."
263,5.0,"It's hard to believe that in the 70s this stream was all covered up.  This is probably one of the more successful urban planning projects and you can tell by the amount of people that stroll along it's banks.  If you have some time for a leisurely walk, go down to this stream  once in the day time and  once at night.  It's a totally different experience walking in the day versus the night."
264,5.0,"A good place to walk through. It is a long stretch, so take your time to walk all along. There are many shopping malls along the stream, so whenever you are tired, just stop by there."
265,5.0,"I headed straight from Bukchon to Cheonggyecheon Stream and decided to walk the majority of it at the water level. Even in March when all the plants are still hibernating it's a cool place to visit with murals and a nice view of all the sky scrapers. Under some of the bridges there are even art exhibits (ironically, right next to the signs to evacuate immediately if the flood siren wails) so make sure to explore a little! There is a laser show at night, but I wasn't up for it - check out other reviews on that one. Taxis were easy to catch along the river as well - I'd recommend walking it towards the end of the day until you're too tired to do any more and then catching a taxi back to your place. (Don't forget to bring a card with your hotel/BnB printed on it in Korean. Most taxi drivers don't understand mangled Korean and don't speak much, if any, English.)"
266,4.0,A great location to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. You can take a nice quite stroll along side the river or sit and relax. It does get crowded near the waterfall but further down the stream its less busy.
267,4.0,We visited the start of the stream and enjoyed what we saw. It is only a short walk from City Hall. will visit again to take a walk.
268,5.0,Nice just to stroll along next to stream as many locals do. A little cold in march but beautiful all the same.
269,4.0,"Well taken care of and so beautiful at night, it is truly a fantastic walk.Great finish for a lovely day at Seoul.Was there March 19th 2014"
270,5.0,"Took a long winter walk from Dongdaemun upto the city centre with freinds (about  5 kilometers, by my reckoning). It was so refreshing to hear the rippling of water all through the walk, and to see the highrise office buildings with people working away even at 8 in the night above the wall. I was told that there are fish in the stream but couldn't spot any. Every now and then there were stones strategically placed so that one could cross over to the other bank. Given Seoul's climate, this is an ideal way for tourists to get around the city"
271,5.0,"this is why walking through Seoul is so great.  The city management has really thought extensively on creating unique green space and natural experiences in the middle of a huge metropolitan area.  Close to major areas and easy to experience with the Myeongdong, Insadong and Gyeongbokdong palace.   I walk it frequently and enjoy it each time."
272,3.0,Located South East of Gyeongbokgung Palace; The canal had a purple conch architecture iconic display at begining of the stream. These are a place where you could chill linger your time and emotion and watch city life goes by.
273,5.0,"Cheonggyecheon is so beautiful, and to think that t had been buried up until recently! It's another of the fascinating beauteous wonders of Seoul that one should not miss!"
274,5.0,"WOW, if only more cities would do this!!So this used to be a concreted over old sewer/stream but thanks to a revitalization project it is without a doubt the best way to get from one end of the city to the other. A relaxing stroll along the river which is sunken some 15' down from stream level takes you though interesting water sculptures & seemingly almost natural stream sections, with market stalls in parts, stepping stone river crossings, etc.Excellent."
275,4.0,"I pass over this stream's bridges twice daily on way to office and back.It is very peaceful , clean and free from tea/ coffee shops crowds- very good place for walks and photography- good staircases to go down and come back up on street level.At the end there is a SNAIL SHELL Colorful structure model and just below that water falls down a few meters with a good clean pure water flow- many reas around the stream.GOOD FOR HEALTH."
276,5.0,Pros- so fresh- so calming- beautiful place to just take a slow stroll- quite nice and clean for a public place
277,5.0,This is an excellent place to take snaps at night and walking distance to namdaemun market (10min) which is the biggest market in South Korea.The night view at the stream is awesome
278,5.0,"Cheonggyecheon stream is a nice revitalized area in the middle of a street and comprised  between big buildings on its both sides. It is a very relaxing area and perfect for a little escape walk alongside the clear water. Apparently some activities and festivals are held there, so you should check it out cause it seems the perfect scenario for that and it should be awesome."
279,4.0,"Is a nice place to take a rest after walking for the whole day.The night view better if you have tie to spend here, buy some drinks and snacks to chat over here."
280,4.0,"Seoul has done a great job along the Cheonggyecheon Stream.  It's right in the heart of the city where you can stroll along the river and try some Korean food, or enjoy cultural events that happens quite often around there. The water looked very clear, too."
281,5.0,Nice location and settingBeautiful festival but full of people at night.You come across it while walking from the north centrevill towards the south business center around Lotte Town in Myeongdong Area
282,3.0,"Most visitors would probably opt to just stop by the head of this stream at Cheonggye Plaza as it is the main area for fountain and lights. However, I started my journey from Ogansugyo, which is directly in front of the Dongdaemun (subway station) stop and walked downwards to Muhakgyo. I suppose if you are not a particularly reflective person then one would not enjoy the stroll as much but I found it relaxing and amusing to see the decorated walls alongside the stream. Also spotted ducks in the stream, which goes a long way in indicating how successful this urban restoration project is.Extra: Shopping landmarks like Doota and Migliore are located next to Ogansugyo (the other side would be the Dongdaemun shoe market)."
283,4.0,"A very long stream in the heart of the busy and chaotic city of Seoul. Just a few steps down from the main road you arrive in a different world. Busy streets and noise is gone and you are inside an oasis where you can relax, and walk through the stream. The stream was almost a swamp back in the beginning of 2000s but the local government converted it into a recreation area and now it is a very quick getaway for Seoulites. It is especially very beautiful in the evening with lighting."
284,4.0,"When you don't have enough time to go somewhere far but you are so tired of the city life, this is a right place to go. Just sitting on the bank with your feet in the water and listen to music. A cup of coffee would be a great combination!"
285,5.0,"Absolutely amazing. A great place for walking and relaxing. A historic yet modern landmark. Joining the Seoul City Walking Tour (Cheonggyecheon) certainly helps understand the brilliance of this stream. Everything about this stream (the history, the sculpture, the painting, the bridges etc.) is just fascinating. Do come back at nighttime and take a seat by the stream. It will make you fall in love with Seoul instantly."
286,5.0,"Ideal hangout place with your friends. I went during Summer, highly anticipating my visit during winter.Must be really beautiful."
287,5.0,I happened upon this stream completely by surprise. A relaxing stroll that can drop you off at some interesting places. The bridges that cross it are neat to look at as well. If I had more time I would have dipped my feet in the water and enjoyed some of the music from one of the street musicians playing under nearly every overpass. I also really liked the untrimmed grass and foliage which gives you just a tiny bit of nature in the heart of the city.
288,4.0,"Seoul is a crowded city, so sometimes in the evening, if you want to take a quiet walk downtown, without cars and motorbike running all around you, this riverside stroll is what you are looking for."
289,4.0,"Cheongyecheon has a lot of history, but what it is now resembles nothing of its original form. The original Cheongye water stream was a naturally made small river with flowing waters. It was all but demolished and roads and buildings took its place during Korea's industrial boom. However about 10 years ago its resurrection plan was made and the result is what you see today. It is artificially remade without thinking too much about nature, so the water doesn't flow, and they actually bring water from somewhere else and pour it to Cheungyecheon. So the water isn't exactly clean. I don't recommend you diving in it or even putting your feet in there as many locals like to do, without knowing or not caring about this information.I feel bad about how they went about reconstruction of Cheongyecheon, but the truth is that this is about only oasis that exist in Seoul. It stretches long enough ranging from City Hall to Dongdaemun, and it is by far the best spot to take a long scenic walk in Seoul. You can do a lot of fun people watching, and there are many entertainments going on throughout the establishment. You won't be bored and yet it's not as crowded as some of other hot spots in Seoul which can always be hectic just walking by. If I were you I'd visit it around the time when the sun sets, and starts to walk slowly as the night comes and the lights start to lit up Cheongyechon and musicians start playing. Enjoy the night!"
290,4.0,"I liked walking along the stream and checking out the people enjoying this area, from local people, tourists and school kids, there are cool bridges along the way and little arty installations, the locals really seem to like this area right in the centre of seoulI would say not to miss this"
291,4.0,"Well the last korean President Mr. Myungbak Lee decided to the city of Seoul a little oasis to relax and this is the artificial river Cheonggyecheon. It starts in Jongno-gu and goes all the way down to the main river of Seoul the Hangang river. If you walk along this river you will recognize that the river is devided into several different sections of art & design. Each is unique and have a own character. Evrywhere around are tons of children paying, So if you visit Seoul, go there and make your own picture how you like it."
292,4.0,"I found it very pleasant to walk along this stream with its greenery and stepping stones. There is little shade though in the day and the only places to sit are on the stepped areas under the bridges. It is well mapped along the way so you can see how far to the next bridge, place of interest. Really good for people watching, you can look at some artwork and I saw a heron there and fish in places in the stream. Wikipedia has a wonderful picture of what it looked like at the beginning of the last century! After that it was concreted over and made a highway. It's amazing how quickly this was changed into what it is now."
293,4.0,"i was lucky to visit this place when there was seoul lantern festival. gigantic beautiful lampions with various figures were laid on the stream; very beautiful i didn't realize i held my breath for too long. it was very nice to walk along the stream, enjoy the lampions, the crowd, the scent of the plants, the mist from the water, as well as listening to the charming sound of the stream beneath the murmur of the people.  as jakarta citizen, i was so impressed by the beauty of the stream, since we  only have sirty, smelly, horrible rivers in our city. too bad i didn't have time to visit the stream in the morning / afternoon, to get different scenery from this beautiful stream."
294,4.0,"This little canal which runs through the middle of Seoul is a beautiful little oasis of peace. Formerly a polluted stream running under a large bridge, the area was remodeled, cleaned and sidelined with greenery a few years back, and is now a pretty promenade right in the center of Seoul. With a small stream sidelined by green, trees and grass it is a pleasure to end a pleasant afternoon in town with a walk along the stream."
