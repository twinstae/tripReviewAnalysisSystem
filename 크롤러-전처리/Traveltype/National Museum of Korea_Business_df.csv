0,4.0,"It was a muggy day when we visited as it’s been raining on and off. As part of the tour, we went through it within an hour. Could easily spend half a day if you’re into history and artifacts"
1,5.0,"An amazing collection or series of collections. It is well layed out asy access and all have English desriotions. Pick up a guide and headphone set, worth it."
2,4.0,"This is a huge museum that tells the story of Korea extremely well. It has a wide range of artifacts dating back thousands of years, but also extending into the modern era. Plan on several hours at the minimum."
3,5.0,"The place is highly recommended for a must visit, if you are in Seoul. You can reach here by Metro. Figure out your nearest metro station and reach here. You may have to walk a bit though."
4,4.0,Love it here. They have the show in sections. from the dynastys till the modern era. Have audio in English also.
5,3.0,"As Corea suffered wast devastation in up to three wars during the ladt century, there is not that much left to be exhibited, although exhibits are carefully presented in a very modern building."
6,4.0,"Subway Line 4 will take you there. Just follow the sign and then walk along the long corridor, you will soon reach the museum.Very spacious and the environment is quite good. Quite true, it’s a bit cool in the sense that there are not too many people and the space itself is quite overwhelming.Good collection on Buddhist paintings and sculptures. Must see.Some nice restaurants. Good for spending a few hours there. This is my second time visiting the museum. Think I’ll still go back."
7,5.0,Unfortunately we were rushed round this stunning museum by our tour guide. It gives a fascinating history of Korea and has many uniquely fascinating exhibits.
8,4.0,I thought there would be a Korean emphasis but instead there were many things from other countries so that I did not feel I got a good flavor of Korea
9,5.0,"A most stunning building with a great collection of artifacts. Free admission, and easily accessible via subway (Icheon stop). Well worth a couple hours to see all the floors."
10,4.0,"If you want to know more about the local culture this is the place to be; not only you can discover the +40 manners to prepare the famous local vegetable kimchi, but if you are lucky you can attend  a local arts performance with local music and many colourful dancers."
11,5.0,Very beautiful and interesting museum. You can learn so much and the staff there is more than willing to help. A must see if visiting Korea.
12,5.0,The sheer size alone makes this attraction a must-see. On the inside visitors will be swept away by the highlights of cultural achievements of the past half millennium.
13,5.0,Some of my traveling companions took two days to see the museum. I did a quick walkthrough and it was impressive.
14,5.0,"This museum is one of the best that I have ever visited, extremely large with a huge range of exhibits, there is free wifi available plus food and drink outlets."
15,4.0,"This is one of the most spectacular museums that I have seen.  The grounds are flawless, the museum is interesting and sparklingly clean.  Great restaurants inside.  Permanent collections are fascinating.  Well worth a visit."
16,5.0,Guide gave us nice explanation. Well organized museum. Very well expressed historical facts. Wish I had more time and enjoy more detail. But overall museum is not extremely big.
17,4.0,Very informative museum with great displays of Korean wars from the past.  It's free--who can ask for more than that?!  Three floors x2.  Most everything in English as well as Korean.
18,5.0,"It is the right place to see, learn & understand the True Korean culture. rich history of Korean is on display here... worth Spending whole day here.."
19,5.0,"We spent our one rainy day in Seoul here. My husband moved at a very slow pace. He loved it! I people watched, and enjoyed wandering around the well laid out exhibits. We had lunch here, pretty decent food at a reasonable price."
20,5.0,"I have visited many museums and to be honest after a while they tend to become a blur. This one did not and I think that this was largely due to our English speaking tour guide (you have to book when you enter the museum) I learned so much. The childrens part is the usual hands on, dress up offered."
21,5.0,"This is an excellent museum. It is huge. If you spend even a minimal amount of time looking through the exhibits, you will need a full day to see them. However, you can find the highlights in a couple of hours. Some of the most spectacular exhibits for many Westerners are probably clustered around room 108, where the golden crown is located, on the ground floor. The restaurant is good, but it has a limited Western menu, and is rather expensive: spaghetti with meat sauce and a soft drink for two was about 45000 KRW. Be advised that if you have limited mobility, you can probably get the taxi driver to take you into the parking structure beneath the museum, from where you can take elevators or escalators directly into the museum without too much walking. However, the museum staff will not call a taxi for you. You have to walk several blocks out the front of the museum to get to a main street from which you can catch a taxi to return."
22,5.0,"The museum far exceeded my expectation. I had less than 90 minutes and would have loved at least another hour. There was so much to see--and the exhibits were so varied. The grounds were beautiful, but it was raining so I didn't get to stroll. My favorite exhibit was the statues of the Buddhas. The gift shop was excellent. I would have loved to have tea in the cafe and take a leisurely look at more of the exhibits."
23,4.0,"This place is one of my favorites to study Korean cultures. In the museum, you will be able to see lots of old things like boat, jewelry, statues and etc."
24,5.0,"This museum is world-class and by far the most enormous and exquisite museum I ever been to. With the perfect surrounding of the green, this place offers knowledge and serenity for its visitors. It's amazing how such place amplify the locals and tourist with knowledge about the history of Korea through its heritage and culture. The cafe's range of food is amazing and tasteful and you can take so much photo of the garden. This is highly recommended and it's a regret for anyone not to come here."
25,4.0,It is worthwhile to visit this museum. You will see the history of the former Korean Kingdom and the development of the people. Please visit the place next door as well. Admission is free of charge. You can have accupakket of coffee after the visit as well
26,4.0,Been to Korea numerous times and never went to the National Museum so I decided to pay it a visit on a rainy afternoon. The signs are not very good but the historical documents inside are fascinating. Most of the old books / documents are written in traditional Chinese characters ( which I can understand ). There was a deed that a couple sold themselves into slavery and another document laid out the warranty on the building of a castle. A fantastic map in Chinese characters ( so call 'world map' ) drawn in Korea was mind blowing too....
27,5.0,"I really like coming to the National Museum. First, it's free to the public. That's totally awesome!It has many cultural and historical items worth seeing. Nearby is a park and small food shop which cheap food. I really recommend to come here.They finish building the underground walkway from metro to here. It's beautiful!"
28,5.0,"I like to go to museums. But I go always very directly for a part of the exhibition. I never try to do the whole museum in two hours or a day. I visited the buddha collection only, very inspiring and giving balance. After visiting and a special cup of tea in the museum I was satisfied. Next time another part of the exhibition. Go for the Buddha exhibition to learn about the differences between China/Korea and Japan."
29,4.0,"Was taken during my business trip to Korea, very interesting indeed, well worth a visit if you happen to be in the local area"
30,4.0,I get here using the hop on hop off bus.I didn't enter due to I didn't have enough time but I walk into the park and a lot of korean people goes on weekend.
31,5.0,A good overview of the Korean way of life and how the culture evolved over the centuries.  This is a free tour and was a great museum to visit while at the palace.
32,5.0,"Definitely worth going.  Plan to spend an entire day there because there is a lot to see. You can also have lunch there.  Beautiful exhibits.  Watch out for hundreds of school children...all well behaved, though."
33,5.0,"We enjoyed touring the National Museum of Korea. What was particularity facilitating to me where the Korean treasures such as the Silla gold crown and the Celedon porcelain.  We learned a lot about Korean history, culture and arts at the museum."
34,5.0,"This is a very nice (and FREE) museum with a good collection of art and historical artifacts. I spent most of my time on the first floor, which takes you (counterclockwise from the entrance) on a complete tour of Korean history through the imperial period. I had read Bruce Cumings Korea's Place in the Sun before arriving, which is a history of Korea in the 20th century, so he breezes right through the preceding millennia. This museum was excellent for helping me flesh that out in my mind."
35,4.0,The English guide I had (free) was very good.  The museum has a good overview of Korean art and the guide was able to explain the historical and political significance of the pieces we saw.
36,4.0,"I enjoyed the visit, however not long enough.  There is so much to learn about the history of Korea here.  The grounds around are well maintained and a nice walk around."
37,2.0,"The museum might be interesting for koreans or people with knowledge about korean history. If you have never heard of the different korean dynasties, you will only find pottery and ancient documents with chinese characters without really understanding their meaning and context. There is only minimal english explanation."
38,4.0,"I had just a couple of hours to spare, so I focused on the newer (= last 1000 years) sections on the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties. There are many interesting exhibits, but I felt that the information was limited. I had a Korean friend with me who provided excellent additional context on what I was reading, so that helped a lot."
39,5.0,"I highly recommend that you visit this museum if you want to understand the very long and rich  history of Korea.  It is excellent at establishing a timeline and showing how the various parts of Korea, China and Japan interacted and mingled over that history.Most of the exhibits are subtitled in English.  It is well worth the time!"
40,5.0,I love it! It was really impressed me. Where we can learn a lot on Korea historical and how korean mindset from historical knowledge.
41,4.0,"I had already visited the Leeum Samsung Museum of Art, so I had already seen quite some celadon and Buddhist artefacts. But this museum is quite a different story. A huge collection of ancient Korean (and other Asian) objects, in impressive good conditions. The museum is free, so it's a must-see. Just don't try to see everything in one day, just pick two or three wings."
42,5.0,"This museum is an architectural beauty and contains comprehensive exhibits of Korean history, art and crafts.  Entrance is free and it is easily accessible by metro"
43,3.0,there's a paid and a free exhibition area.. the free area shares korea's history - that was quite interesting if you're into cultural and anthropological history. museum itself was big and very well spaced out. abit hard to get a cab from there though
44,5.0,"As with most things in Seoul, this museum is new, large, and beautifully designed.  The exhibits are well laid-out, taking you through Korean history by the cultural artifacts."
45,5.0,Free Entry and very interestin exhibitions. Simply a must if you stay for longer than one week in Seoul
46,3.0,"As all museum, also the National Museum of Korea is very interesting. Perhaps the section for the Paleolithic and Neolithic is a bit confused. Very nice the private collections section."
47,4.0,pay some of your time to this museum to introduce yourself to Korean history and culture. Get their before noon to avoid crowds
48,4.0,This museum is just the right size. Not too small or too large. Nice little ending to your visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace. Has items adults & kids would like to look at. Also check out the Chinese zodiac figures outside the entrance to the museum.
49,4.0,".Large, comfortable museum.  Learned quite a bit about Korean history from the exhibits.Colection of Japanese, Chinese and Indian artificacts was impressive, as was history of each cultures' impact on Korea.Worth the time to visit."
50,5.0,"Seoul is an ancient and very troubled city with a past full of drama, invasion, enslavement, dictatorship, poverty, sacrifice and a spirit of recovery.  This museum captures all of these elements and is very easy to find your way around.  You can get a headset, or get on google and search up a local guide (usually a history student) and for a little extra get the low down.  Not one I would recommend for kids (lots of slavery, war and horror amongst the societal development), but to understand some of the drive that exists in Seoul it is important to come here and get the history.  Not so much an artefact place as a history place."
51,5.0,"The National Museum of Korea is vast. Set on a generous site, even the approach to the museum is impressive. Entry to the permanent collection is free - and looking around that will easily take up several hours. On the day I visited there were many school groups in the building but the sheer scale of the place meant that it didn't feel like there too many people vying for a glimpse of the collections. On the ground floor the displays relate to the history of Korea, from prehistory onwards. But this is history set out as art, with uncluttered showcases, unobtrusive technology showing explanatory videos or animations and lots of circulation space. Upstairs are paintings, calligraphy, and decorative arts including several rooms of celadon ware and other pottery styles. For those wishing to purchase a souvenir, the shop located on the ground floor (with smaller satellite shops on upper floors) has a wide range of gifts and books. The facilities are spotless and there are cafes on site. Try the cherry gelato! Very highly recommended as part of a visit to Seoul."
52,4.0,Free museum.  Good exhibits and history.  Close to shopping area and restaurants.  Worth the timie to learn the culture.
53,4.0,"I really enjoyed visiting the National Museum of Korea. It is a very popular attraction for Koreans as well - it was packed when I went there, over a rainy weekend. Beautiful collections although no detailed information in English. Still super worth a visit!"
54,5.0,"We went for the Korean history of ceramics. Their collection goes back two thousand years, and shows the development in ceramics very beautifully."
55,4.0,"The National Museum of Korea is housed in a huge building on the former golf club of the US garrison in Seoul. The scale and design of the museum is more like an airport terminal than a traditional museum. A very spacious museum, ideal for package tours and school groups.There a longish pathway from the main entrance of the park to the building itself, which can be pleasant but I would have thought that with Korea's climate (cold winters, hot summers), it would be inconvenient for half the year. Perhaps the architect wanted to encourage the use of cars.In general, there are clear explanations of the displays but the choice of foreign language is a bit curious. Some have English, Japanese and Chinese explanations but some only have English or Japanese. Perhaps the curators have views on the interest or sensitivity of certain groups. Special exhibitions are charged but the permanent collections building is free.The first floor is consists of history of Korea from paleolithic to the Joseon dynasty, with well curated artifacts arranged by chronology and also by themes. The Shilla golden artifacts are particularly noteworthy.The half of the second floor is devoted to Buddhist arts, calligraphy and paintings, Also of high quality but needs some specialist knowledge to appreciate. The other half is devoted to works donated by private collectors. I am sure that everyone appreciates the genorosity of the donors but the collection seems a bit random. Also the quality of the pieces is good but I am not certain whether it is of a national museum standards. Perhaps there is more meaning in the identity of the donors than the peices themselves.The third floor has an area dedicated to art from other Asians countries. Very small and nothing of interest. The main area of the third floor is devoted to sculptures and ceramics, which regains the high standards set on the first floor. Great examples of Koryo celadon and the iconic pensive Buddha are here.There are restaurants, a food court and a cafe. The coffee is over priced as usual but the food is good value.It will take a whole day to see everything but if you focus on the first floor and parts of the third floor only, you can do it under three hours. In conclusion the building is too large for the exhibits so although its a worthwhile visit but be selective and wear confortable shoes."
56,5.0,Huge museum with interesting exhibitions. Very nice place with a fantastic surrounding park. It´s admission free and I really can recommend this place.
57,5.0,"Firstly, the architecture of this building will blow you away. It is just a beautifully designed space that is a pleasure to spend time in.The exhibits are fantastic. I'd suggest the guided tour which shows some of the main highlights and given some orientation, then do some exploring on your own. This museum has a great range of exhibits that will engage people of all ages. There are also a few nice little places to eat, and a great gift shop."
58,5.0,The museum is very well organized but you have to visit it 2-3 times to understand the history of Korea.The best time to visit is early on weekends. During the school days museum is full of children who come here for field trip.
59,4.0,"For those who have been to museums such as the palace museums of both Beijing and Taipei, this museum may be slightly underwhelming. However it is still the best place to start brushing up and understanding the history of Korea and understanding its place in both ancient and modern Asia. Entrance is free and its easy to spend at least half a day there..."
60,5.0,This museum is huge. Anything you want to see. It's also free. We were there at the time of the great Impressionism exhibit which was wonderful (it had a cost). Overall a must see.
61,4.0,A very good overview of Korean history and culture. Also an interesting section on other Asian civilizations. Very good museum shop to get fine quality presents at all price ranges.
62,5.0,"The National Museum of Korea, now a FREE admission museum, houses amazing valuables from the smallest and most ancient, to a huge stone pagoda and relatively recent art. Artifacts from all parts of Korean history, and a sampling from China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and South Asia are all presented in a clear and engaging manner. Whether you are looking to explore celadon pottery or impressive buddhas, they are all here. The architecture of the museum adds to the experience. Even the gift shop is elegant and has reasonable pricing. If you want to know more about the culture and history of Korea, this museum is an essential stop on your itinerary."
63,5.0,Certainly value for money with lots of interesting and varied displays in a large airy modern building. Certainly worth the hours it'll take to truly take in the historical and cultural exhibits
64,4.0,"I visited the museum for the first time a few days ago and was very impressed.  First of all, its free!  I joined an English speaking tour--also free--which lasted 90 minutes.  The tour was just ok, since the guide was sort of soft spoken.  However, this is an impressive place.  The building itself is gorgeous and there are three stories of exhibits.  I especially enjoyed the calligraphy and painting exhibit as well as the large display of Buddha statues.  I took the tour, had lunch, visited the store, and then went back to see more exhibits.  In total I was here 3 hours.  Since it was raining all day, this was a nice alternative to the many outdoor sites in Seoul."
65,4.0,It is well worth the visit. Great and extensive collection - amazing in its richness and very fascinating as well. well worth the visit
66,5.0,They have done a great job in capturing the dramatic and traumatic history of a country that has gone from a third world country to a modern economy in less than two generations.
67,5.0,You could spend the better part of a day here if you like museums. Korea has a rich and long national history. So much to see. I liked it all.
68,5.0,Nice place to visit if you are interested in Asian culture. The architecture of the museum is also pleasing.
69,5.0,"plan to spend at least half day and take the English tour as they explain in detail plus I spend time walking around just looking myself, great history knowledge."
70,5.0,"The museum is very nice, with plenty of exhibits and English explanations.  The museum provided an excellent description of Korean history with plenty of art and sculpture throughout the different periods of Korean history."
71,4.0,"This museum contains many artifacts of Korean Life.  It is arranged in order of life experiences starting with early life, progressing to mid-life, and finally funeral rites.  There are many displays of typical Korean clothing."
72,5.0,sections were neatly organized. it gracefully combined history and heritage in a series of rooms. clean landscape and tourist friendly.
73,4.0,"Easy to get to and free, the museum contains bi-lingual signs and explanations. If you have a spare morning or afternoon I would recommend a visit"
74,4.0,Beautifully displayed objects from medieval through modern periods.  Delightful restaurant for lunch.
75,5.0,History of Korean people is displayed ...for the people who are into anthropology ...this would a gold mine ..
76,3.0,"No one can deny that the building is beautiful.  A middle of this 5 story building is hollow to accommodate a historically important pagoda.  Yes, the word 'hollow' rang in my mind so many times as I focused on arts and artifacts.  Except for the first floor, the display was sparce with a few few objects.  It was such a contrast with Louvre or Metropolitan Museums.  Where are all the national treasures shown in the catalogue?  It will be interesting to find out the ratio of displayed and owned objects of this museum. I wonder whether they have tried so hard to build a nice building that the national museum building cannot accommodate an adequate amount of artifacts to back up the 5000 years of Korean history. And the choronologically classified art objects were somewhat disconnected in flows.  The stiff faces of the security guards reminds the visitors that this is an 'official' building rather than a fun place of arts and joys. Having said these, there are some merits beside the building itself. The adimission is free;  the surrounding area is pleasant; the gift/book shop is good.  I have also found that their special exhibitions are not to be missed. This time I enjoyed the Koryo porcelain show.  By the official authority and power of the National Museum, they can gather a host of treasures by borrowing so much from other musuems."
77,4.0,"Enjoyed my visit on a cold Saturday afternoon. The museum building itself is worth visiting.  There is a lot to see and depending on ones' interest in art or Korean history one could spend a full day.  I found it very informative in the three hours I was there with a good half hour in the Korean tea house in the museum  I also found the museum store rich with some very interesting pieces and a wide range of prices.  Great place to get gifts for self, family and friends! By the time I left it was dark and had a beautiful scenery of Seoul and the Seoul Tower.  Again, the museum building itself was nicely illuminated and worth appreciating."
78,5.0,"Good example of interactive museum, very well organised and interesting. I had an afternoon before boarding the return trip, may well take 1 days ifnyou have time and interested in Korean culture."
79,5.0,"A really great museum, very well organised and set out. Some wonderful items. Staff very friendly and helpful."
80,3.0,"Not too large a museum, unlike the British Museum in London. But gives a fairly accurate and descriptive picture of Korean history. And being located next to the palace has its merits - you can combine both vsits in one day. Advise visiting the museum first before heading to the nearby palace."
81,5.0,"What a fabulous museum! But, be prepared to walk a lot, even though there are escalators! We spent 3/4 of a day going through the museum.  Before we started a 3 week long tour of S. Korea, we wanted to know a bit more about its history. We started in the Paleolithic gallery and moved on from there. It did our hearts good to see school children in the museum on field trips - there were hundreds of them! We found the videos of archaeological finds and palace complexes particularly impressive, plus they offered a place to sit. The traditional tea shop was also very welcome: a nice view overlooking a small garden, along with tea and cookies. The 3rd floor is devoted to objects donated to the museum by various collectors. We found those as interesting and informative as the ""regular"" exhibits. Although there is public transportation to and from the center of Seoul, we took taxis, which come by the outer gates of the museum frequently. I would highly recommend this museum for ALL tourists."
82,5.0,We were amazed at the extensive array of artifacts at this museum. Beautiful building with much to see.
83,5.0,"Excellent museum highlighting cultural artifacts, clothing, food, and historical objects/displays.  This was my favorite of the 10 or so museums/historical sites I visited in South Korea!"
84,5.0,Testimony to all who sacrificed of themselveslocally and  internationally. Moving sculptures and artifacts of the recent war and prevailing international concern. A tribute to both the best and worst we can be. A must see.
