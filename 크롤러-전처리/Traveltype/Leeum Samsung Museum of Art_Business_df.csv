0,5.0,"Housed in ultra-modern architecture by Mario Botta, Jean Nouvel and Rem Koolhaas houses collections of old  and contemporary Korean art as well as international modern art. Definitely must see for architecture and art lovers."
1,3.0,So Samsung makes smartphones and has its own museums.This one is not about tech though. It has a wide variety of artifacts including ancient ones. Drop by here if you want to feel less guilty about spending all time only drinking in Itaewon. Walking distance from there.
2,5.0,"very well curated with explanation in English, great exhibits (dont miss the shipwreck rooms): a must when in Seoul"
3,5.0,This was a peaceful and beautiful museum. Well-presented and explained. They also had a very nice shop.
4,5.0,"I went to the Leeum Museum last week.  For 8000 won you get a ticket for the day to see the historical section, the modern art gallery as well as any special presentation that day. It is best to pay for the electronic guides in required language to detail the individual works. The historical museum provided me with an introduction of the dynasties in Korean history.  The modern art works were very interesting, I had no clue what the artists were saying at times so that electronic guide helped me learn a lot. The day I went there was a special moving visual arts display which was a very interesting and  good fun. Would recommend."
5,5.0,Wonderful ceramic and art collection in a modern setting with an electronic guide that told the history of each piece when you stood in front of it.
6,5.0,"Designed by three noted architects, this small museum has one wing for traditional Korean art - ceramics, paintings and artifacts (all amazing) and another for contemporary art and a third for children activities.  Beautifully arranged on a hillside with fantastic gardens.  Near shopping and good restaurants"
7,4.0,"where nature, art and architecture have been put into one place in an aesthetic way, the space itself is worth visiting, though the artworks were being poorly presented."
8,5.0,"I enjoyed visiting this museum quite a bit. It is evenly divided between a modern art collection and three floors of traditional Korean arts (the celadon pottery collection in particular is magnificent).The gardens out side house a couple of Kapoors and a Calder among others.If you have a couple of hours, take the time to visit this private museum. It's well worth it."
9,5.0,"The Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art is a museum in Hannam-dong, Yongsan-gu, Seoul, South Korea, run by the Samsung Foundation of Culture."
10,1.0,amazing building filled with predictable bits....one would think that' in this day and age Damian Hurst and sadly Andy Warhol would have been confined to the dusty shelves....worhol  poppies must be so dated it's almost becoming back into fashion....the de Kooning and Joan Mitchell the best.
11,4.0,"The building of this museum alone is worthwhile visiting (especially the spiral staircase). Furthermore, I loved the combination of ancient celadon, Buddhist artifacts, and very modern art. Good audio guides too."
12,3.0,â€¦this is a bizarre museum both architecturally and artistically.  Mainly installation art in three buildings each designed by a different high-profile architect.  Overall impression is that I'm not too sure.
13,5.0,"anyone who enjoys good art and architecture must go.  Very easy to find - right off the subway - and worth a half a day.  Where else can you see architecture by Rem Koolhaus, Jean Nouvel, and Mario Botta.  plus work by Damien Hurst, Anish Kapoor, Jeff Koons, Alexander Calder.................."
14,5.0,"This is one of Seoul's finer museums, considering this is  a city of excellent museums.  Tops in showing modern & contemporary artists.  It's located on Itawan, a great shopping street."
15,4.0,The building itself is a work of art.  The collection and special exhibition are exceptional.  The cafe is small and has a limited selection.
16,5.0,"Really well done museum and great area to walk around when you are done with the museum. The technology they have for the audio tour is second to none.  The only issue we had was that the audio tour would suggest that the piece in front of you is the ""most beautiful"" of its kind... This happened repeatedly and the museum should note that beauty is subjective and no museum or curator should suggest such things when describing the work in front of them."
17,5.0,"For all that are interested in contemporary arts and architecture, a visit to the LEEUM Samsung Museum of Art is a must. Often there are temporary exhibitions on specific artists or periods. Swiss visitors are particularly encouraged to see architecture from famous Swiss architects such as Mario Botta."
18,5.0,A wonderful collection of Korean art and international modern art.  The architecture of the three buildings would be worth the visit alone.  We arrived just as a tour in English was about to begin.  The guide was articulate and helped us appreciate the wonderful classical pieces of Korean art in the collection.
19,5.0,"Amazing exhibits, well laid out, great blend of technology and exhibitions to explain what you are seeing.  Very kid friendly."
