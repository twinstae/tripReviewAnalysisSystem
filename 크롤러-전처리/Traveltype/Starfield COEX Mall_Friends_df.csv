2,3.0,"Very wide. Complex structure. But attractive place. There are many restaurants, too. I really liked the library. I think You don't have to visit. But it's not bad"
3,4.0,"We visited Starfield Coex Mall on a Sunday noon in September 2019 .Upon stepping into the mall, we were so so impressed by the huge library which is located right in the centre of the mall. There is a mammoth collection of local and foreign books and magazines and the tall huge walls are lined with books as well.  The library is very spacious with many seats available for reading and browsing pleasure.Besides the amazing library, Starfield Coex is a modern mall with everything shoppers need for fashionwears & accessories and services for all ages and also plenty of dinning choices.Understand that within this hige mall,  there convention halls, cinema and aquarium. We didnt explore much as we were heading for other destinations given our short stay in Seoul.It is a beautiful Mall and l would love to return for another visit for this is a place to make me smile , especially the lovely iconic library ."
4,4.0,"COEX Mall seems to be the largest mall in S Korea. It has got everything from what I see  ..... from clothing and accessories stores carrying domestic/international/designer brands .... I like shopping in  Aland. Lots of restaurants and cafes inside this mall so whenever you're hungry, there's something to eat for everyone. It has a large cineplex with a total of 17 screens, the COEX Aquarium, the ASEM Plaza and the Event Court. The Starfield Library inside the Starfield Coex Mall is impressive with  thousands of books and hundreds of seats. The library is located right in the middle of the mall, but it’s not your average quiet library as it's bustling with students and people having a fun day in the library."
5,4.0,"Really good underground mall with numerous shops and eating joints. The shops are mainly of democratic brands like Armani Exchange, Zara, etc. Lotte Duty Free is also there as well as an interesting bookshop and Kakao Friends store. The complex also encompasses an aquarium, a movie theater and a library."
6,5.0,"Not all libraries are quiet spaces. In this area there are huge walls of books right in the center of the mall. It makes for a perfect picture opportunity but also an opportunity to read books, socialize, or relax. Attached to the mall are many shops and restaurants and at the opposite end there is the aquarium."
7,5.0,Seoul is famous for its markets but you can have a more relaxed shopping experience in Coex. I'm not much into fashion but I can stay for HOURS in the home section in ALand. It's got a huge collection of items from Flying Tiger Copenhagen which I love because they're fun and funky and oh so cheap. The food court offers a wide range of choices too!
8,4.0,"If you are into mall tours, this is the perfect place for you.  It also has a library and the Gangnam style statue outside the mall...Nearest subway Samseong station."
9,5.0,"We have limited time visiting Korea but we made sure to visit Coex. We visited Coex near closing time so we went straight to the library.  I love the library, it is a good place just to rest and read. I can spend my entire day here.  I will surely go back here."
10,4.0,"One of the best shopping malls  I really enjoyed it here , everything in one place and the ResturAnt's are good"
11,3.0,"This shopping mall is easy to get to via subway, and offers a comfortable shopping experience with international clothing brands and a few trendy korean brands. If you are looking for a lower price range of clothes or unique korean designer clothes, this mall is not recommended. But be sure to check out the starfield library which is a very famous photogenic spot!"
12,4.0,"A great place to get out of the cold in the winter.  It can challenging to get here from the city center in a taxi (especially when it is snowed and rush hour), so the metro may be best way to get there.  Lots of food options and shopping.  The library was very cool."
13,4.0,"huge mall with plenty of things to do (cinema, aquarium, library, shopping, cafe, restaurant).shopping wise is not the go to place. But intersting library design worth the visit."
14,5.0,"Coex is a huge mall in Gang nam, seems like it has everything including the coolest library. Can you imagine a library in a mall? Worth a visit to take photos!"
15,4.0,"The library is very impressive with nice design and many books. We took a lot of photos there. There are many people reading the books and having a cup of coffee. There are many shops, restaurants there also.It is nice to visit this place."
16,4.0,Located at gangnam district. Very big mall has an aquarium on the bottom floor and many shops if u like shopping it's heaven.
17,3.0,"Sure there's a lot to do, and there are plenty of places to shop. There are festivals and clothing stores and restaurants and an aquarium and movies and and and. It just goes on and on. It's hard to find your way around with the curving non 89 degree angle turns. THere are info booths with English to help you find stuff.It's just a bit daunting. Give yourself plenty of time to walk, to get lost, and then to find the subway / bus / exit you need at the end."
18,3.0,"Its a Huge mall in Gangnam district, mostly high end items available. Can spend a whole day shopping here, many coffee and pastry shops."
19,5.0,"This mall probably has everything you need from home goods to little cute things that you can find in Korea. They are currently in process of constructions and more stores to come in. It's a great place to hang out, shop and eat."
20,5.0,"This Coex Mall is very big to explore, they even have aquariums and place for exhibitions. Coex Mall is a high end mall located in Gangnam area. Not so much to talk about this mall, other than those special features, this is just like a normal mall with expensive things. Try to walk around, inside and outside the building cause it has such a nice design."
21,5.0,"Amazing shopping mall in Gangnam. Lot of restaurants, acuarium and stores. Ohh and the PSY hands statue!"
22,5.0,"Underground shopping center with variety of choices when it comes to shopping for clothes and more, alot of restaurants and a cinema is available. Connected to 2 department stores (Hyundai & Parnas) 2 mins walk to the subway line 2."
23,4.0,"It's a Huge underground mall with many facilities from shopping center, restaurants, post office, smtown until casino. It's an integrated and connected to many building in the complex which might make us frustrated and  get lost to find the way. Eventhough there are signage and information center, you might still feel confuse. But overall, it's a great place to look around and travel when you are not rushing time. Lots of International Brand exist there."
24,4.0,"Not sure if there's a shorter way, but we had to walk quite a few blocks from the Gangnam Station exit to reach the front of this enormous mall.Unfortunately, we arrived around eleven at night, way past the closing hour of this mall. I would have liked to get inside. Even at the late hour, you could see the interior and how big the place is.We then went to the front  after locating the new art installation for Gangnam Style, and danced like fools under the hands so we could cross off ""Dance to Gangnam Style in Gangnam"" off our bucket list. HAHAHA.Needless to say, we got weird looks from people who looked like they were on their way home, as well as from those who just got off at the bus stop behind the monument. We also probably gave a laugh to the people manning the CCTVs. =))))"
25,3.0,No point of interest despite being the second largest mall in asia. Layout is so confusing and and got lost a few times trying to find the food court. Too many international brand that can be found anywhere.
26,4.0,"This mall is huge so u could focus on certains stalls that u are hunting for, or just shop wherever u walk to. Tried the drinks and cake at Sopresso Coffee, which were pretty good"
27,3.0,This mall was enormous! Full of expensive shops and a little less expensive shops that you see everywhere else in Seoul. The aquarium was a point of interest but we did not go because it's too much and if I wanted to see fish I'd go diving instead lol. There's a huge K-Pop shop/museum connected to it that was interesting. Our group wanted to see the Kimchi museum but it was no longer in the mall anymore.
28,4.0,Talk about shopping this complex is huge there are many shops and high-end trendy stores if you are on a tight budget I wouldn't come here because it's really high end restaurants and stores. It's also very large but it's also very confusing I found it very difficult to navigate so if you're willing to spend a lot of money and buy really nice high end clothing and purses and watches this is the place to be it's also very close to the subway station.... near 잠실 too!
29,2.0,"It's hell to find anything with no rhyme or reason why it's laid out the way it is.  I thought it was confusing before the 2 year renovation but I was soooo wrong.  They label shops by letters and numbers but it makes no sense when they intersect with each other and the arrows/signs are just wrong most of the time.  Spent 20 mins looking for a restaurant in the food court but it's not a traditional courtyard style food court.  It's just restaurants almost along the same row.  It gets even more confusing when you add the Oakwood arcade foodcourt into the mix.The shops aren't really anything special either.  They claim no exclusives in Seoul and everything can be found in Myeongdong, Gangnam or Garosugil.  The only benefit might be when it's poor weather outside since COEX is underground."
30,4.0,"This mall has many shops out of the ordinary, and is therefore worth a visit. Many wacky stores makes this perhaps the best place to go if you only have one day shopping in Seoul. There is a large selection of restaurants as well with a variety of foods."
31,5.0,It's a big mall with an attached convention center and aquarium. It has got all the international brands and has great ambiance. It is also attached to a metro station making it very easy to access. Great place to shop and spend a few hours.
32,5.0,"COEX mall is so huge that it is divided into different sections.. i'm quite a map nerd.. so during my trip with my sister.. we literally got lost.. hahahaha.. we are unable to comb the entire area because we have no idea which part have we went and which part we didn't.. because it's just too huge.. just like any other shopping malls.. a lot of shops to shop around.. a lot of makan place to eat in.. not sure about cafes but we do find one to chit chat and enjoy the cakes while taking time to rest from the long hours of walking.. will revisit it again when we're back to Korea and hopefully this time round we can comb every single section and every area of the shopping mall.. c"",)"
33,4.0,"Been to this mall countless times before it was renovated and reopened. The mall has been greatly improved, with the addition of more stores, restaurants, etc. which help avoid rainy afternoons outside. For the Kpop fans there is now a store solely for SM Entertainment music."
34,2.0,"I used to visit COEX regularly before the much needed renovation. Often for the Mexican restaurant (now shunted outside the complex), COEX had a charm about it, was always busy and had plenty of great looking young people wandering around. After returning to Korea I was excited to see that it had reopened and I ventured back only to find a sterile, brightly lit, overpriced and not very busy abomination. If you can imagine a sprawling airport duty free shopping experience, without the bargains then you've no need to visit. They killed COEX!"
35,3.0,We came when the Coex Mall was still undergoing renovation.Nothing to see except the Aquarium which was really expensive and looks small. So we did not go.
36,4.0,"I was just here a week ago and while they're still finishing up some construction, most of the shops have moved in. There's a food court with lots of different food, a wide variety of big brands (Versace, AJ, Kiehls, etc) along with some local korean stores (mostly along the corridor to the food court). There is also an A Land + Art Box. What I liked most about this mall was that it was right underneath the Grand Intercontinental Parnas, and it's easy to just go down and grab a bite to eat. I believe the Oakwood and Intercontinental Coex is attached to it as well. The Coex also connects to the Parnas Mall which mostly a few restaurants and like 4 stores. It also connects to the Samsung subway station and the Hyundai Department store. There is a movie theater + Coex Aquarium located inside."
37,2.0,I was here during the grand opening on 27 November. Most of the stores weren't open and the stores that were open were still moving in. Wait until the renovations are done before shopping here. It's not worth it.
38,3.0,"We went there to shop because we heard it's one of the best malls in Korea, but unfortunately about 85% of it was under renovation, and they said it may take about 1 year till it will be fully open. So we end up getting in the aquarium, then we had lunch in the same mall and we get out.So if you are to go there, make sure it's fully open."
39,3.0,"Very nice mall in Gangnum street and next to Samsung station(subway) well knonwn station. The mall is srounded with 2 Intercontinantal Hotel, Grand Intercontinantal  (Old), and  Intercontinantal Coex (new). both hotels are connected directily to this mall.Best of This Mall Is:1-Burger B Restaurant2-Coex Aquiream 3- Anime and module toys store( i forgat the name but it is infront of the Aquiream) 4- CGV CinemasIt has a CGV cinemas, a big Aquirem for the famliy and kids, some korean Resturents and some Brands for shopping."
40,2.0,"We went there because it claims as ""The Largest Underground Shopping Mall in Asia"". We curious to find out. Unfortunately, it was not as we expected, it was faaaaarrr from our expectations. Only few stores and restaurants were open, the Coex Aquarium, Megabox Cinema, and Lotte Duty Free. That's it! We walked for like 2,4km back and forth to find a practically EMPTY mall. On our way back to the subway station there were a big banner that we missed before, it said ""WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE INCONVENIENT, WE ARE CLOSED DUE TO RENOVATION. WE WILL BE RE-OPEN ON NOVEMBER 2014"". And we were rolling on the floor laughing for our ""unfortunate event"" =))"
41,3.0,"Very huge mall with many shopping as well. But we didn't shop much as most are retail and departmental stores. They're better shopping areas like hongdae, ewha uni etc. We came to COEX mall for Marche, as it's world's no.1 marche which serves buffet! One pax for 23000W, what a good deal! And it's near Lotte World as well. I would recommend coming here if you're heading to Lotte World to have the marche buffet, if not probably not worth coming to the end of Jamsil Station. If you've visited my profile, you will read more details in my blog. xx"
42,4.0,"I've been to this mall a thousand and one times during my two-year tour in Korea.  It is a fantastic place with TONS of shopping and things to do.  It has a mediocre arcade, a nice aquarium, a great movie theater, a hotel, a convention center, and countless other things to do.  The place is so big, I got lost the first couple times I went there.  I was wandering around and would suddenly find myself in a hotel or something.  The subway leads directly to the mall (literally, you walk out of the station, you're in the mall), just get off at Samseong station.  Best if you bring a friend who is familiar with the place."
43,2.0,"Not even sure why I went there, one of the guys who was traveling with wanted to go for what ever reason. Needless to say, I did not enjoyed the place. It was crowded, smelly, and super hot. Unless you enjoy shopping, I don't see why you need to go. One positive about the place, we found a very good local restaurant. It was very cheap as well.Happy shopping if you enjoy doing so."
44,4.0,"The COEX is an underground shopping mall that boasts many brand-name stores, boutiques and gourmet eateries. The Mall is conveniently connected to two Intercontinental hotels, and the famous Hyundai Department Store. it has a multi-cinema complex and an aquarium."
