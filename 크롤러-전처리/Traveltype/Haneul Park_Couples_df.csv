0,5.0,"I found this place from a few blogs that recommended scenic places to visit in South Korea. It is not hard to get here. Just needed to walk quite a distance from the train station. This visit to the park is very nice if you have one whole day to spare and relax walking around to just look at the scenery. There are other parks nearby but the area is very huge and you cannot visit them all in one day. Our feets are also hurting from the long walk. I visited during the end of Autumn, nearing winter. It was worth the trip here because it is really as beautiful as described in the blogs and when I was there, there wasn't a lot of people or tourists. Only the starting area has some crowd, but when you start to walk up and explore the tall plant areas, it is very peaceful and quiet. And you can take beautiful photo there. Just remember to bring a tripod if you have no one to help you take photo! I would suggest not to step into the plant area as it will kill the plants. There are already some area that people have cleared for you to step into so you can walk around and find those areas to take your photos instead. If you do not want to hike up, there is a place near the bottom of the park to purchase a ticket for the buggy car to bring you up, One way or round trip.  The ride is very nice if you can sit at the back seats which was what we did.  If you are hungry, there is a little snack shop near the tall grass area, with many choices of food and beverages. There's also a few table and benches where you can rest and eat your snacks or instant noodles on. Just outside the train station, there are some shops selling clothes if you are not wearing enough."
1,4.0,Interesting at the top with the grass  land and good views of Seoul.   Noticed long lines for the shuttle to the top.   Not sure why so many waiting for shuttle.   You could walk to top in less time than in line.  And there is a gradual road to top if you want to avoid stairs.

After sweat a bit you will see a great tall grass field and nice view of Seoul opposite the Han river from the top of mountain. This park is good to visit before winter. We were there in the end of November and saw they started cutting the grass."

It's right next to Seoul World Cup statdium, however you have to walk around it to find the way going to the park.  We hiked up the hill which isn't so bad and took the tram going down.  This is a must when you are in Seoul, it's amazing view is breathtaking.  It was a dumpster back in the days and was reclaimed to commemorate the World Cup in early 2000.  A must see in Seoul!"

It was a nice place for photography although the time i went they cut most of the grass there but still there is some left for me to take photo. View is breathtaking."
7,4.0,This location is very good for taking a picture with weeds backgrounds.Located near the World cup stadion for football.There are two ways to reach the top area by using the shuttle transportation from the entrance gate or walking up use the hundreds wood steps of stairs.There is jogging track and a cafe.Very recommended area for hanging-out and relaxing also to see the Seoul city from the top of park.

I went up by the stairs and it was a little bit tiring but it was totally worth the climb. After you climb up you need to walk a little bit more to Haneul Park! The view was breathtaking and can take a lot of beautiful pictures! After hiking up there is a cafe right up there for some snacking."
9,5.0,Visited the park in the 3rd week of Oct. A short walk from the world cup stadium and after 291 steps later will bring you to beautiful panoramic view of Han river and namsan.Endless eulalia grass with silver tips was a beautiful sight! Great for a stroll to be away from the city!
10,4.0,"At the recommendation of JW Marriott Executive Lounge staff, we decided to try this gem. I was pleasantly surprised at the beauty, ease of hiking, and facilities within the park. The view was simply amazing! We took the stairs up and walked down the path. I would recommend that you walk the path that's lined by trees/forest on both sides. It was a beautiful path. At the top of the Foothill (after working up 260+ steps), you walk up few more steps, and you're presented with beautiful prairie and various walking paths as well as the observation deck. This is great place to visit, and it's free!!!!"

However, on this specific Saturday it was crowded and noisy, so maybe a weekday would be more relaxed. Be ready for a lot of stair climbing and paths with moderately steep inclines. Great panoramic view over the city."
12,5.0,"This park was beautiful. A true hidden treasure is the heart of Seoul. First you have about a 15 to 25 minute walk to the top of the hill. There is a place to by drinks and snacks at the top. Once you arrive you will soon see endless fields of flowers, tall grasses, light tunnels and a large bowl structure that you can climb inside of. It's essentially a large maze that's perfect for taking photos. You can also see some great views of Seoul. You can easily see Namsan Tower and the nearby World Cup Stadium. I highly recommend this park!"
13,4.0,I love this place. Quaint and away from the hustle bustle of the city. Not to mention the view from the top is amazing - you can see the river and the World Cup stadium too.
14,4.0,"This park near the World Cup stadium (part of World Cup park, between Noeul park and Pyeonghua Park ) in mapo-gu is easy to get to.  Signage gives clear direction and the stairway to the top of Haneul Park was well maintained.  There was information at the bottom of the stairs saying there are 291 steps to the top and the amount of calories that will be consumed for the climb.  Along the stairway, the park very considerately shows the count of steps from 291 so as you go, you know how far you are from the top.  It was almost 8 when we arrived.  Regret not bringing a proper camera to shoot the beautiful Hangang with lights on in building on both sides and the many bridges crossing it."
