0,5.0,"This is a good stop for history, souvenirs, and there is also a very nice coffee shop inside as well as clean restrooms!"
1,1.0,"The museum is hard to reach by public transport and the ""art"" shown in the galleries is ok at best. The classic exhibitions are heavily overpriced and nothing is in English. As a non-Korean visitor, don't bother. The museum of modern art is 1/5th of the price and way more interesting and stuff is English.I have hate this place and i can't recommend it to anyone."
2,4.0,"Nice museum with permanent exhibits and rotating ones as well as other arts like Opera, classical music and dance. I spent a few hours there looking at art and stumbling into a contemporary dance show which was pretty good and very original. It was a little hard to find a taxi out off the area."
3,5.0,"On the occasion I visited there were two distinct gallery's at Hangaram. There is very little English here - so, be enchanted by what you see. Marie LaurencinThe first gallery I visited had an extensive collection of works by Marie Laurencin. No photography as you might imagine!!! Still a nice collection of France and French beauty. I enjoyed my visit here. Worth nothing there is no connection between galleries and there is a charge for each. MuseProceedings to the upper gallery I though I was going to see Van Gough, Matisse and Renoir. But not so - but what I saw was equally entertaining. I saw the decomposition of the art work after which it was set to video. It begins with a walk through Van Gough's cornfield whilst it blows in the Breeze. Onwards and you see the stars of starry night blow about - amazing technical application from masterpieces. Simply magical animation.We end with a church by Matisse whilst Vivaldi plays heavenly music. What a spectacular arrangement. To be seen to be believed."
4,2.0,"I understand if you do not have English for temporary exhibits, but there is no excuse for not at least having an English audio guide or even one single pamphlet in English.  Chinese, Thai, Australian, and North American tourists rely on English translations; we should at least have an opportunity to understand what the museum has to offer.  To be this exclusive sends a message that foreigners are not welcome.  You guys are hosting the Olympics in two weeks?"
5,5.0,"Hangaram Art Museum is part of the Seoul Art Center. Is huge! Lots of galleries and exhibitions. There is a coffee, lots of souvenir shops"
6,4.0,"I'm a regular visitor here. The parking lot is adequate, and the lobby is quite wide. The bar and food is okay, although a bit pricey. The program being run is quite good, and has a concert almost every day.The view is fine, with almost no obstructed view (try to avoid seats with overhang). But the acoustic is somewhat questionable - it is quite dry. Second floor front seats have best acoustics."
7,4.0,"As with all my reviews to sights in Seoul I will preface this by advising visitors to carefully check opening days and times and whether timed entry tickets are needed to access certain parts of the attraction and also the times for booking guided tours in their language of preference â€“ bearing in mind that numbers can be limited. Obviously concert tickets etc. need to be booked in advance to guarantee seatsThe Seoul Arts Centre covers an immense site and includes a concert hall, opera house, exhibition spaces, open air performance areas and enormous public spacesThere is a music fountain/water feature that ""plays"" at scheduled times throughout the day with a changing music programme. I visited at night time and was a little underwhelmed visually and the music was virtually inaudible. Nevertheless it was enjoyed by the families who were there. On the same evening a free open air concert was being held and had attracted a very large audienceVisitor amenities and information all excellent"
8,5.0,Enjoyed a symphony concert here in 2016 as I was attending a Rotary International Convention. The hall is amazing with excellent acoustics.  Outside they have an interactive fountain where kids play and enjoy music.  Excellent  venue
9,4.0,This complex is cool for its architecture and the variety of arts programs offered. I went for the Frida Kahlo-Diego Rivera show and was not disappointed.
10,4.0,"I haven't been to their shows but I always go for their art. They are able to get great exhibition curated for people in Seoul, so it is always the best. I really enjoyed the Frida and Rivera exhibit showing their whole life of works. Also, mid summer they have watershows on the terrace and is really fun to watch with family and friends."
11,4.0,"The performances are world class and it was easy to book on line, but getting to the centre was difficult.  Take the subway and get off at the Nambu Bus Terminal stop. The SAC is not far away from there but not easy to find; the hopper bus, took about 45 minutes through the traffic so I suggest you take a taxi from the station, for the less than 5 minute drive. Getting back to the subway afterwards is simple - follow the crowds to the main exit where you get onto the green hopper bus no 11 for the 5 minute drive to the subway.  There is lots to do at the SAC so get there an hour or two before your performance starts."
12,4.0,"Music, drama, dance....All kind of art performance areaCheck schedule, before visiting."
13,4.0,"I went there almost by accident, I just visit a temple and was on my way to the historical museum and I past it, free admission, went inside some of it was closed, but I was there for about 40 min and I like it."
14,5.0,With multiple theaters and 4-8 events a day I can always find an interesting performance. I gravitate towards the soloists in the two smaller halls. But have seen the larger productions in the opera hall. I show up a half hour before the show. Buy a ticket. Get a glass of the house red at the small wine shop in the lobby and thoroughly enjoy my time there.
