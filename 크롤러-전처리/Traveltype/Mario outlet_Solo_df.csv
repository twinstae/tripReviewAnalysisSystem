0,5.0,"Compared to the other places around, I find Mario to be the be the best in terms of coverage and price. It's a bit crowded but that's to be expected. There're a total of 3 buildings connected. The price is the same as the Lotte outlet next door, but Mario has more brand and choices.I recommend spending at least 3 hrs+ here to hunt for the best deal."
1,2.0,"Brands are mid-range or parochial, prices are not impressive and it is comparable in both price and selection to the Hyundai department store across the street. Doesn't feel like a real value proposition- if you want cheap stick to underground malls/street markets. Neighbourhood is boring and out of the way to boot. Nah."
2,3.0,"massive shopping mall, lots to buy. There are food outlets too to stop and grab a bite. Prices are slightly cheaper, but look out for sales, can get good bargains."
