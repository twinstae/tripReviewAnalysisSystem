0,4.0,"Above the museum is the statue of the King, and that of Admiral Yi, on a area between two of the main highways leading to the Gyeongbokgung Palace gate. It is opposite the US embassy and there are plenty of bus stops there. The statues are huge and really dominate the area.  The underground museum, telling of the king's life and works, are here and access is free."
1,3.0,"The story of King Sejong is a museum, which is dedicated to this famous king of Korea. He is known for the creation of Hangul, Korean phonograms. The museum is located near the statue of king. The entrance is free."
2,5.0,"I seldom enjoyed reading about historic stuff in museums, but this turns out to be a surprise hidden gem all cos I was trying to hide somewhere from the cold! I remember entering from behind the statue of King Sejong on Gwanghwamun.Initially I only saw a long frame with loads of korean letters and words and wanted to leave. But I decided to walk deeper and realise.... I saw this place on Running Man before!! Got excited and I continued to explore this free museum. I find it quite interesting and how the information and graphics are being done for the exhibit. At one of the counter, I even picked up a comic book talking about the Admiral Yi Sunshin.I actually find it enjoyable and spent 45 mins here. One of the hidden gems that I would recommend to visitors to Seoul!"
3,4.0,"Displayed in this underground museum are the achievements of the two ""most celebrated"" figures in the history of Korea, namely King Sejong the Great (the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty) and Admiral Yi Sun Shin (famed for his naval victories against the Japanese in the Imjin War of the 1590's) although the two figures belonged to different periods of history (the king preceded the admiral by about 200 years).The ""greatest thing"" to see here is a wooden replica of Yi Sun Shin's turtle boat (not life-sized but I would guess about a third the size of the actual boat) that you can go inside where I was actually ""pleasantly surprised"" by these nice figures (quite realistic-looking really although they are also about a third the size of an actual human) of sailors ""in action"" kind of presumably re-enacting a naval battle scene of the Imjin War; and actually to enhance that ""stationary viewing"", there's also a 4-D documentary show (just near the boat) where you'll get an ""up-close experience"" of a naval battle of that war (watched the 3-pm show, just like under 10 minutes though).  Also, looking at the info displays, I was able to make a ""history connection"" between this place and the Osaka Castle in Japan (that I'd visited just over a week earlier) since the lord of that castle was the leader of the Japanese side in the Imjin War; and also there among the info displays about the life of the Admiral is a ""statement of praise"" by the famous British general of WW2 Bernard Montgomery (who must have learned about this great Korean admiral of like 350 years before his time). And on the King's side of the museum (which you'll actually get to before getting to the Admiral's side, but just that ""more interesting"" things are on the Admiral's side as mentioned above), be sure not to miss these miniature figures in display cases behind glass along the wall (embedded in the wall) which is like a ""narrated sequence"" of the events leading to the creation of the Korean alphabets (they were created either by King Sejong himself or by some scholars under his supervision); I was also ""pretty impressed"" by the King after reading the info display of his instructions to the subordinates to be equally kind to all elderly people whether they were rich or poor and to help out poor bachelors to get married (no wonder such a considerate king  was the greatest Joseon king).Coming by subway, Gwanghwamun Station (on Line 5) is where to get off where you'll be right between the big statues of the King & the Admiral when you come out of the station, and the entrance door is ""right behind"" the statue of the King with the stairway inside the door leading down to the museum below.  Also, Gyeongbokgung, the biggest of Seoul's five palaces, is just about a 5-minute walk north from the statue of the King (you'll see the first gate of the palace straight ahead to the north from behind the statue)."
4,3.0,"These two are very important people in Korean history but if you are not a history buff walking through show cases of their writings that are all in Korean doesn't click. There was an interesting bit on the Korean language and how it is built up and how the general fought some of his battles. It is free and out of the elements, so have a walk through."
