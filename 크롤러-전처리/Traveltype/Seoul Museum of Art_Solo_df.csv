Update your website !!"
1,5.0,"This isn't a museum for overseas travelers visiting Korea for the first time--that would be the National Museum of Korea. But for people living in Korea, this is a great place to keep on your radar. The first time I was here, I saw an interesting exhibit about modern architecture in Seoul (in the free galleries). Nothing I would go out of my way for, but a nice part of an afternoon in one of Seoul's most attractive neighborhoods. My second visit was this past weekend, when I went to the David Hockney exhibition, which was SPECTACULAR. I love living in Korea, but I do miss being able to go to art museums and see Western art. When there's a show like this, I'm thrilled! The SMA scored Hockney's first major exhibition in Asia, and they brought in some great paintings from all over the world. the curation was solid and there were good English translations of the explanatory material throughout the galleries. It was totally worth the special exhibit fee of 15,000 (roughly $14 US). The galleries were busy so I think Koreans are hungry for more chances to see foreign art. I really hope SMA will be able to get more of these special exhibitions. Everyone go see the Hockney stuff before the show closes Aug. 4!"

The outdoor area was displayed some sculpture in the garden, and many people had rest in this area. It was certain that there was the most beautiful art museum in Seoul. The entrance fee was a little higher than I think."
3,5.0,"Although I have been to Seoul a few times, and had passed by this museum before, this is my first time visiting it, for an exhibition on David Hockney's works (from Tate's Collection), said to be the only major exhibition on Hockney in Asia. The museum is worth a visit if there are exhibitions which interest you."
4,3.0,"The building and outdoor property are beautiful but I was surprised when I walked around inside.  It's bright and has well sized rooms, but I don't think they're taking advantage of the space available. I was expecting a great deal more exhibits so the relatively small number of works displayed was surprising and a little disappointing for the time I spent going there. They focus on Korean artists and there were some amazing works on exhibit. I went on a weekend and there were so few visitors my footsteps echoed through the rooms. I felt really sorry for the ushers in each exhibit room because they looked terribly bored for the lack of visitors to help or look at, and I caught one of them sleeping.I think it's a shame they're not making better use of the available space."
5,4.0,"Not very far from Deoksugung Palace, just walking distance. You will find a good Museum with an extraordinary art pieces inside.When i came here, there is an exhibition about modern art and show some good art masterpiece from local and international artist. when in winter season this place make a very nice background to take picture of you or just do a quick ""Selfie"""
6,5.0,"The best part of this art museum is the free entrance part. Myself in particular loved the display of art work presenting the korea peninsula reunification. Upon entering the museum you will see an art work with glass bottles filled with water along with a train track shaping into the korea peninsula. There are spoons tied to each side of the train, and whenever it passes by the bottle it made sounds to a lullaby, and that's the song on reunification. One very meaningful display."
7,4.0,It located very near at City Hall station. Sometimes they held blockbuster exhibition. Great to go to with kids.
8,3.0,Can't be too critical because it's free. Had a cool exhibition from the British Council. Not far from the city hall area. Can be found easy enough from signposts. Check it out
9,5.0,"I guess I didn't really do my homework too well, because I was delighted and impressed by the Seoul M of A way beyond my expectations.Great collections, lovely building, thoughtfully set out and designed to make for a great visit."
10,4.0,Nice statues in the grounds leading to the main building. 3 interesting exhibition s on when i went plus good little cafe and shop.
11,3.0,"The Admission: FREE admissionThe Museum: Walk down Deoksugung Doldam-gil street to get to the museum. This museum showcase modern artworks by artist from Korea and around the world. The Location: 5 minutes walk from Subway Line 1 or 2, City Hall Station, Exit 1, 10,11 or 12"
12,5.0,"My to go place in Seoul and one of the best spots to see art in the city. The curatorial work is more than satisfactory, the staff is helpful and welcoming, informative due to brochures and signs in more than two languages and has a quite pleasant cafe with some souvenirs to offer. I spent hours looking at art and reading books here. Most of the exhibitions are free, love the noncommercial mood of it. The building reminds me of European values, the park and the surroundings are also beautiful and interesting."
13,3.0,"Sorry but the art on display at the moment just doesn't do it for me. Ultra modern, so sometimes really pushing the boundary to the totally ridiculous. A couple of pieces were interesting but not enough to make it for me. Luckily is was free. What I really liked was the deflated people sculptures that are on the road at the entrance to the museum. Loved them."
14,5.0,"Took a bit of a walk to get here, but get down at City Hall station to get here. Was able to view the Renoir and Korean Art in the Nineties exhibits, and I was pleasantly surprised. The Renoir exhibit cost ₩13000, and you can rent out an English audio guide for around ₩5000 or so (forgot the exact price). The Korean Art in the Nineties exhibit was free. Really cool place to just view and experience art!"
15,4.0,It's a very nice museum that is located near Deoksugung and aslo Jeongdong Theatre. A lot of interesting arts are waiting for us too see with FREE of charge. The facade of the building was preserved from the original one. Don't miss if you come around this area.
16,3.0,"Seoul is such an advanced, urban city - I was expecting its art museum to be first-class. It is not a great museum, by any stretch. This is the type of museum you might find in a medium-smallish city anywhere - a museum that has no funding and is very modest in size and exhibit quality. Thank goodness it was free! If I would have been charged admission I would have been upset! It is rather small, so you can cover the whole museum in an hour. It is in a lovely neighborhood, however - I enjoyed the walk to and from the museum more than the museum itself."
17,4.0,"I came here after hearing about the PeaceMinusOne exhibit, a collaboration between Kwon Ji Yong aka G-Dragon and various artist. That exhibit was very sensory with sounds, lights, images and sculptures. I also enjoyed the exhibit on North Korean propaganda art on the first floor of the Museum. The area around the museum is quiet and serene, yet only a short walk from City Hall and the Palace where they regularly hold the changing of the guard ceremony (mainly for tourists, but still cool)."
18,3.0,Went to this museum because it is for free and it houses mostly contemporary art work. Good to spend a few hours at the museum and the neigbouring areas.
19,4.0,"Downstairs there was an exhibit of korean conceptual art which was interesting, at least some of it. Then upstairs there was a really interesting african art exhibit. The museum has nice architecture and it's free!"
20,5.0,"I'm not sure why, maybe because I'm Asian and I can relate more to the themes in the art in this museum but this is definitely one up there. I really related to every piece I looked at, especially ""Follow You"" by Wang Qingsong. It houses some Ai Wei Wei as well. This is a remarkable museum and it's free! I am so glad I got lost and stumbled at this accidentally.I will gladly come back to this place if I ever get the chance to go back to Seoul."
21,4.0,"Some great exhibitions in a great space, in a great location. A mixture of installations, video presentations, sculptures, and art, showing you various sides of Korean work from modern to traditional, and allowing for some great people watching too. Definitely a must see if you're interested in art."
22,4.0,"Seoul Museum of Art was fantastic. With their unique and outstanding work of art. I didn't want to leave, that is how beautiful and amazing their artwork was for me. This for me was a ""Once in a Life Time Experience"". But for others they might think I am exaggerating, but Hey every one has their own opinion. Just be careful because when I went it was really packed, so I went more than once to get a good look at the artwork/art pieces. For those who love art please go here and don't miss out because if you do, don't regret it just think of it as a life learn lesson."
23,5.0,"They were doing (and currently, are still) a feature on Tim Burton when I had visited. Being a big fan, I enjoyed every moment of it. Tickets may come of pricey for others, although I found it worth every KRW spent. They showcased letters Tim Burton received from the Fire station when he was in high school, the letters he received from critics and a whole lot of work and sketches he had as a young artist. Fascinating and makes you understand what was running in that young man's head before he blasted off to being famous. They also showed short movies that he had and the oh-so-famous stop motion animation he is known for. This place is highly recommended for Tim Burton fans."
24,5.0,"Conveniently located just a few minutes from the City Hall subway, it's worth checking out what exhibits are on offer. Right now, it's Tim Butron, and I loved it! I live in Korea, so I try to take in as many art shows as I can. They are not all created equal. The Tim Burton exhibit is definitely first class. Lots of English signage, and well laid out. The exhibit features over 700 pieces of his work, so there is something for everyone. Moving at a liesurely pace, I was able to see everything in about 3 hours. I went on a Friday, so the crowds were not bad. I do not recommend going to any art exhibit in Seoul on a weekend, unless you have no other options. Koreans love to drag their kids, and that includes babes in arms and right on up. Thankfully, there were very few kids when I visited. This could have been because it was a Friday, but also, it seemed to be a different age group. The crowd seemed to be in the university age bracket; no kids yet. You can store your belongings in a locker before entering. However, if you do so, take some money with you. The audio guide and gift shop are in the ""paid zone"". I do recommend the audio guide. Very well done, and I learned alot about Tim Burton, his life, and career. Photos can be taken outside the main exhibit halls, and lots of photo opportunities have been provided. This is one of the best exhibits I have seen in Seoul in a very long time. Most enjoyable, and not to be missed if you are in the city."
