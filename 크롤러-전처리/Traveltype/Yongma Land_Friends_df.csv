There were also a number of couples who came for their pre-nuptial shoot. If you want to take great photos while in Korea, this is definitely a place to be. The 5k won admission fee is definitely worth it. You might want to bring your best clothes for a pictorial if you come here. Tag your friends along because it's more fun with friends. ;)This place isn't for kids btw... Unless you want to have photoshoots here, then you might prepare someone to look after him/her. ;)"

Cause the sun literally sets at 5 something, i mean if you wanna get great shots with natural lighting. Besides, the sunset shot is a must or even time-lapse! Unfortunately, you have to pay 5000won per person for entrance ticket, cause theres people managing the place. But brace yourself, cause the park area was quite small, but you can still find a lot of good places for photo taking!The transportation was hmmm.. inconvenience, but as I'm living in Seoul, getting there was not a problem but for travellers, you might need to really prepare everything (map) just to get there. Or you could just get a taxi (the best way). And I don't know if it can be clearly seen from the picture, but the road was quite steep and its actually hard to walk up there so i would suggest you to wear comfortably. It was definitely creepy though, at least for me."

The rides are out of the 70s and 80s and it's fun to explore.  The owner is very nice and you can climb up and on anything as long as you aren't destroying or hurting anything."
