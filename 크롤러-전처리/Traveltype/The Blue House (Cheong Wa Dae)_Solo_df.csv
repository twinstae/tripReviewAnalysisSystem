However their pride in the property and their government is evident and everything is super well maintained and well protected. For me the fun part was watching the huge tours of middle aged Koreans,similarly dress dressed women, treat the young security guards like sons, and ignore them! It also is the only time in Korea where the crowd has not been constantly on the their cell phones or taking selfies, certainly only because it was forbidden ."

The tour itself is very fast and you don't see much, just a brief introduction and then a quick walking around of the gardens. Unlike the tour of the White House in the United States, you don't actually get to walk inside of the Blue House here... all you do is take photos from the perimeter. The tour itself took about 40 minutes maximum and they don't have public restrooms so if you need to go, use it beforehand. It does come with a nice gift, but the tour itself is not so great."
