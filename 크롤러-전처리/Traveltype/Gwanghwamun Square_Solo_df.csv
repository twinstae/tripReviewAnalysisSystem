1,4.0,"This square is just in front of Gwanghwamun Gate, the main gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace. The square has 2 imposing statues, ie King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sun-Sin. To know more about the 2 figures, suggest you visit the underground museum, located just behind the statue of the king. Free admission. Nice to spend about 10 to 20 mins enjoying the air con and use the toilet before moving on."

4,4.0,"Gwanghwamun Square is locates in the center of Seoul, the 2 major attractions are: 1- the statue of King Sejong (15th century). 2- the Gwanghwamun was constructed as the main gate to Gyeongbokgung Palace, the most important royal palace during the Joseon Dynasty in Korea. It worth visiting to learn something about the Korean history."
5,5.0,"The Gwanghwamun Square is a large, long, thin, traffic free area which extends down from the Gwanghwamun Gate to the statue of Admiral Yi Sun-sin of the Joseon Dynasty. Apparently it is a protest free zone. On the weekend that I stayed in Seoul the whole area was taken over by many small, tent like stalls with groups, mainly of school kids & young people in a massive arts and crafts event. I liked the fact that at least two locations on the square (it's more like a long thin stretch of land between two large thoroughfares), they had built stages and people were performing different forms of music and dance. I sat around for quite some time in the warm October sun enjoying free entertainment on both the Saturday and Sunday afternoons. In addition to the imposing statue of the Admiral there was also one of King Sejong the Great of Joseon who created and introduced ""Hangul"", the native phonetic writing system for the Korean language.Nearby you have the City Hall, the Cheonggyecheon stream and, of course the whole Gyeongbokgung Palace complex. And the well ""fortified"" USA embassy is close by as witnessed by the fairly significant police presence."
6,4.0,"Located in front of Gwanghwamun Gate, so that was nice! The fountains and statues were good to see, happy I went!"
7,5.0,"I think most tourist would only take pictures with or of King Sejeong and thing surrounding it and not go to their museum. The museum btw is free entrance so if you want to take a deeper look on your travel, you must go there. There aren't a lot of people inside and there are a lot of things you can learn from the place. Anyway, I do love how this place is just near the Gwanghwamun gate and when you take your pics, you have it as you background. This place is definitely a must and it's also near Cheonggyecheon stream."

11,4.0,Most statues are just that....a statue.  As a photographer I took it as a bit of a challenge to get a good photo.  Just down the street from the Gwanghwamun Gate of the Palace.  A quick easy walk and you are there.  Another spot for locals and the selfie craze!!
12,4.0,"it is like a must-see but i won't be that WOW. but the square is quite big and you may see a prison-like building there, which is the US embassy... it is a quite bizarre view"
13,4.0,"At the bottom of the square you get a great view down the 2 statues and to the palace at the end. In the sun these make a great picture and a pleasant walk, though it is deceivingly longer than it looks.Once thing to note is that it's always very busy here with loads of tourists, and the streets can be a nightmare to cross with waiting almost 10 minutes sometimes due to the huge amount of traffic and irregular traffic light changes.A must see"
14,4.0,"C ( 17.12.06 ) This square is Seoul's landmark, and many assembly is held. I think there is starting point for Seoul tour. Though there was not many things to enjoy, many attraction is located near this area. And there is historic place about Korea democracy."

31,4.0,"After Gyeongbokgung I went off across the street to Gwanghwamun Square. There were a lot of police lined up at the street at that time, so it was interesting in that the old and the new were happening in one place. I've heard from Korean friends that the police were there because of the protests. It was an interesting place, something you can check out after Gyeongbokgung. Nearby, you could go to Kyobo Bookstore or Cheonggyecheon after."
32,3.0,"I used to live right behind the opera which is on the same boulevard. great place, but cars tend to make this place a bit noisy. try  to go there on sundays or satrudays for special events. Museum below is so so, a bit disneyland..."

38,3.0,"Situated near the both important business centers, transport hubs and tourists sites, you'll wind up here eventually.  A picture of the statue of King Sejong is a must-do on a tourist's trip to Seoul.  The admiral Yi Sunshin makes an appearance, too.  You'll traverse this square on your way between Insadong/Jongno and Gyeongbok Palace.The square is decent enough to walk through, although it doesn't offer much for visitors beyond a few photo ops.  Be aware of political demonstrations; many of Seoul's big ones happen here."

45,3.0,"The Gwanghwamun Square is a very common place to go for Koreans if there are big events. Tourists usually come here for photos and I am one of them. There's not a lot of people here, managed to take a photo with Sejong Emperor which invented Korean and the other general. I heard that there's a museum around and Gyeongbokgong is right behind the square so you can go visit if you're interested. Otherwise, it's just an iconic square for tourists to take photos."

To enjoy best try to go at a time that you have some day light left and stay till it gets dark as the night view is splendid also. There are huge statues of admiral Yi Sun and King Sejong of the great of Joseon. There is water jets and at night which look even better because of the different light combinations. Along both side of the statues run a waterway which is quite unique and has history written on the stones. The best part of it is that you have plenty of things to see around the square like city hall, the national library etc."
48,4.0,"Lovely square especially at night.  Lots of tourists (both group and solo) taking photos and there are multiple good photo spots. I visited it multiple times en-route to Sejong Center, and during one of the trips i saw a protest being staged there.  Each time i walk towards this square, i could see visible police presence (generally very young looking police, could be cadets) but they general don't look at us (we obviously look like tourists) - they only paid attention to the protestors"
49,4.0,"I highly recommend walking through this square after visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace since it's a stone's throw away.  The square has large statues of King Sejong who created the Hangul writing system and Admiral Yi a Korean military hero.  The square also commemorates the people who died in the 2014 Sewol Ferry Disaster.  If you're feeling adventurous, you can walk down a bit further to get to Deoksogung Palace."
50,4.0,"If you are in the area to see other things such as the palaces, museums, or City Hall, definitely stop by to see the two large statues.  There are often protests going on in the area, though, so keep that in mind. There is still a memorial (and protest) area set up for those who died in the Sewol Ferry incident."
51,4.0,"I would suggest you visit Gwanghwamum square together with the Palace. You can actually see the Gate and Palace from the Statue.For those who knows Korean history and love watching historic dramas, you gotta visit the Square and take a picture with the King! :)There's also another Statue with the General, all lined up in 1 straight line! :)"
52,4.0,"This public space provides great views of the Gyeongbokgung Palace and downtown Seoul on both sides. There was a public demonstration when I visited, which was mostly peaceful so I did not feel unsafe."
53,5.0,"I was here on a sunday afternoon, where market like stalls were setup.  Many were selling North Korean items and/or proposing peace with North Korea.   Most of the information was in Korean.  But, when prodded the stall attendants would try to explain in english.  I had coffee from Pyongyang which tasted pretty good.  Saw a North Korean group dance which looked more like an Irish Jig expect the participants were in traditional Korean clothing.   This place seems to be crime free and there was ample Police presence.   Although, a few harmless homeless people hung around.  Around here are the famous Seoul tourist spots.   Also, closeby there was a Free Korean Drum event going on.  The music and singing could give some of the rock groups a run for their money.    Seems like a good place to bring kids and involve them in activities.  Easily, accessible by public transport."
54,4.0,"This large square is just outside leading to the Gyeongbokgung Palace (main royal palace). It has embassies around it and I am also told, the setting for a dramatic scene Iris drama. It is large enough not to be crowded and it is a nice walk smack the middle of the city with statues of King Sejong and Admiral Kim Yu Shin. This place is also connected to 2 subway stations so it is easily accessible. You can also check it out at night for a different vibe.  When I was there, there was also an exhibit of the Sewol Ferry Accident with pictures of the students found and those still missing. Really sad."
55,4.0,"Here you can find two statues that greatly influenced Korean history--King Sejong (created the Korean alphabet or mainly known as 한글) and not far from him is the statue of Admiral Yi Sunshin (defeated the Japanese fleet).This place is also famous for its beauty after dark with the dramatically and colorfully illuminated statues.There is also a museum/gallery located at the back of King Sejong's statue (The Story of King Sejong and Waterway of History).Gyeongbokgung Palace is easily spotted here--it has a nice silhouette that lies against the Bukaksan Mountain.Sometimes, exhibits and events are held around this place. It is a good place for strolling as well."

57,3.0,There are a lot of people and a lot of stuff happening but none of it is exceptional.The iconic sculpture in the square is worth a photo if only to prove you were there. Worth a half hour of your time.

61,4.0,"To visit the Gyeongbokgung Palace you will get first to this long square. It has some big sculptures of remarkable Korean personalities, but its main interest is the good picture opportunities that offers you, with the Palace and the mountains behind. Additionally it makes an ideal spot for the start and finish areas of the Seoul Marathon."
62,4.0,"Even if you didn't plan to visit the square, it's location means that chances are you're bound to pass by anyways.The square is near public transport and various other attractions. Because of its proximity to political offices and the like, protests can be frequently seen taking part in the square.Icons of Korean history are forever remembered and honored through impressively large statues. It may be worth the effort to learn about these historical figures if you're planning a visit, as an increased appreciation help elevate the experience."
63,5.0,"A recommended second stop to any Seoul visitor after seeing the grand Gyeongbokgung Palace grounds. Great to have pics taken here and for more info , head to the back of King Sejong's statue and explore the museums downstairs. Informative without being pushy with too much information. A must visit in Seoul."
64,3.0,There's not much really to see at this square except for the two statues (one of a king). It's a nice to walk the length of it which ends at the palace.
65,5.0,"As you come down from the city hall - take in the scene.  On a clear day - mountains, Gueongbuk palace, modern architecture and Gwanghwamun Square.  I find it inspiring and breathtaking - and to see King Sejeong each time is a trip through history and a representation of how important he was to modern day Korea.   The site of many celebrations and even demonstrations.  Make sure you put down the selfie sticks and 'have your moment' in the square."
66,4.0,"Seoul and Korea have a long rich imperial history.This is best reflected in the many palaces, museums and statues to the mighty of the past.One area that dominates is Gwanghwamun Plaza in thed downtown heart of Jongno-gu.The long wide boulevard links two royal palaces.Dominating the wide open road are two statues of leaders from the past.The first, warrior in military pose, is that of Admiral Yi Sun-sin and commemorates the 23 battles he fought with 12 warships, when he led Koreans to victory during the Japanese invasions of Korea between 1592 and 1598. The second, more kingly relic is a 6.2-meter high, 20-ton new bronze statue of King Sejong the Great of Joseon, famous for creating the Korean alphabet in a form that could be understood by the ordinary workers, against great resistance from the Chinese and Confucian scholars, protective of their knowledge and superior reading skills.Underneath the statue is a fascinating museum which tells the story (in Korean but you can follow much in English translations) of the creation of the Korean language."
67,4.0,Pretty nice to take some pics as the gate od the palace is inbthe background.It's close to the city hall and therwfore easy to reach.

69,4.0,"A photo spot, anyway you turn you can snap  a picture. Easily accessible right of Gwanghwamun subway Station, I have walked out of the subway and found myself in the middle of the square. If you keep walking straight you will get to Gwanghwamun Gate and Gyeonkbokgong Palace. Statues are impressive and there’s so much to do in the area. Have lots of time and comfy shoes. I have heard view with the mountain is amazing unfortunately during my 3 day stay the fog have not left the town."
