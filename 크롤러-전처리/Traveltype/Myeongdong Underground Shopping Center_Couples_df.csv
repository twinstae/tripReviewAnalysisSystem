0,3.0,"Not many stores in the mall. Prob around 50 or so and selling similar stuff. From my understanding there are better underground mall in Seoul. In Myeongdong, stick to the streets good enough. Only visit if you got time to spare. Plus point is perhaps its clean and you wouldn't get lost."
1,5.0,"Myeongdong is a must to come.   Arriving Myeongdong Station, you will be immediately attracted by the underground shopping center.  Ladies clothing is the best buy as they are all 100% made in Korea.  Korea is famous for Ladies Fashion at affordable price. Of course, the technique of bargain is essential here. Be aware that all known brands here are fakes just as at Itawon in the past.As a matter a fact, there are a number of underground shopping centers at Myeongdong district like Hoehyeon  , Euljiro and Sogong underground shopping centers.  You can take your time to discover. Probably you could find a bargain."
2,2.0,Area is conveniently located. I heard a lot about this underground shopping Center but I was disappointed when visited. it had a distinct second-hand discount market feel to it. Though the prices were reasonable the look and feel of the area was a major disappointment. I would recommend avoiding the area or making it a low priority on your visit.
3,3.0,"I couldn't get into underground shopping centres I'm afraid.  All sorts of shops, cafes and bakeries, but nothing i was terribly interested in.  We used the station a lot because it was near our accommodation, but didn't shop."
4,3.0,"Every major subway station in Seoul will have its own underground shopping center.They are more or less very similar- with many small shops selling clothes, bags, souvenirs, food, cafes, bakeries, etc, etc.We stayed in Myeongdong & thereby passed by this shopping mall daily when taking the subway.Frankly, you don't need to specifically go to any subway underground shopping center.Browse through if you have time, whenever you happen to be in that particular station.You see one, you seen them all........!"
