0,5.0,"I was doing a walk and stumbled upon this Shrine, and as it had free entry to celebrate a special day I took the opportunity to visit.The shrine is a green area within the city and has clear flat paths to navigate to head up to the shrine. To get from the path to the shrine there are 3-4 large steps. A ramp on the northern side entry might assist.The shrine itself was not open but you can see the building.There were several toilet blocks and also a covered pavilion.Worth the visit to this world Hermitage site"
1,5.0,"A must visit site that can be visited ONLY with free guided tours provided on-site. English speaking tours are at 10am, 12pm, 2pm and 4pm. You are not allowed to join other language tours. On saturdays, you can enter the shrine on your own without a tour guide. Entrance fee is 1000 won incl tour guide"
2,3.0,"Don't visit expecting to be blown away or see a something really mind blowing. The shrine was free for myself and my mother as we were on a tour, but normally it's like 1200 won I believe. There's some neat gardens and the tombs of the 19 main Joseon emperors. That's about it. Some decent photos, but nothing crazy. Once you start the walk you have to finish it, so if you're not sure about your legs, save your time. There are also lots of racoons walking around, but they don't bother people."
3,4.0,"This shrine complex is dedicated to deceased kings and queens of the Joseon Dynasty. It is used for memorial services and ceremonies. Unlike the palaces, the buildings are simple in design to reflect its solemness. Building layouts also reflect Confucius belief. Note that visitors can only enter Jongmyo Shrine in guided tour group at specific times on weekdays (closed on Tuesdays) and Sundays. Only on Saturdays, visitors may enter at their leisure. English guided tour schedules - 10:00, 12:00, 14:00 & 16:00hr."
4,5.0,I took the mandatory free English tour. Very interesting and well brought by the guide. You learn about Korean tradition and history and mostly about how they experience ancestry and death. The buildings are real and there is a sense of peace and awe in the air. Unfortunately both the tours here and at changgyonggung palace start at same times.
5,5.0,"Visited this UNESCO site during my trip to Seoul and was very glad I did.  The whole experience was fantastic and well organized.  This is the only site that requires guided tour to enter thus the crowd flow was manageable allowing visitors to take their time, photos and walk through the vast site to fully appreciate this piece of jewel of the past. Visitors must take note of the guided tour times and show up in time to join them. I didn't buy tickets ahead of time, just showed up at the ticket counter 1 hour before the tour, buy ticket and wait.  It was a worthwhile wait.  Highly recommended,"
6,1.0,"Aparently you have to join a guided tour (except Saturdays and the last Wednesday of every month) which isn't mentioned clearly in official Seoul tourist guide. So when I arrived, the English tour already started and they refused to sell me a ticket for a Korean or Japanese tour. They only wanted to sell me a ticket for an English tour, which  I would have to wait hours for. The pictures look great, though."
7,5.0,"After visiting all the palaces and temples in Seoul, I happened across the Jongmyo Shrine, where the spirit tablets of deceased kings and queens are enshrined. Most days you need to go on a guided tour (cost in May 2019 - just 1000 won!), offered in a number of languages. Because I arrived in time for the last tour of the day, it was in Korean. I was fortunate to have a bilingual family on the tour, who interpreted the main points for me. This has been one of the most serene and beautiful experiences of historic sites in Korea. The whole place exudes tranquility. I was fortunate to visit on a glorious afternoon, when the shafts of sunlight shone through the majestic trees in the complex. As our group of about 20 were the only people there, we were able to get a better sense of the history."
8,4.0,"This is a very nice palace and gardens, and the guided-tours only policy makes it less crowded than other similar historical sites. It can only be seen from the outside, as the main buildings is a mausoleum, but inexpensive and definitely worth a visit."
9,4.0,"Jongmyo shrine is a UNESCO world Heritage site. It is dedicated to the deceased kings and queens of the Joseon dynasty. The spirit tablets of the kings and queens are kept here and ritual ceremonies with music and dance still take place. It is a good example of a Confucian royal ancestral shrine. There are guided tours in Korean, Japanese, English and Chinese at specific times. The various buildings are interesting but some were closed  and could be viewed from outside. There were two that were open but we could not step inside them - we could only peek into them from outside. I wish there was more to see. The guide did a good job explaining the history etc.. I loved walking the grounds. The place is calming and peaceful."
10,5.0,It can be a bit tricky to find the entrance. If you are coming from the palaces you need to walk to the South gate of the park. Free entrance on the last Wednesday each month. Beautiful shrine and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A bit crowded like everywhere else.
11,5.0,Jongmyo Shrine can only be visited as a guided tour except on Saturdays. I went on a guided tour and our guide was wonderful. Her English name was Clare and not only did she speak about the shrine but she highlighted the culture and psyche of Korean society as a whole.Learning a little more about the cultural context was really enlightening and has helped me understand the people here a little better.The shrine itself is simple and solemn as it is a place for spirits ;) I really enjoyed the quiet as that was in stark contrast to Seoul as a whole.Would definitely recommend!
12,5.0,"Although it's somewhat inconvenient to have to go with a tour inside the shrine, it was great to have a guide through all the buildings and explain the significance of the design and the practices that occur(ed) inside the shrine. Just look up tour times as you plan your day so you do not have to wait around to join a tour."
13,5.0,"I came just before 4pm and managed to get in with the last English tour of the day. Due to the tour format of the shrine, it is not overly crowded like some palace tours. Our guide had excellent English and discussed the ceremonies and histories in detail, and how a recent ceremony had just taken place related to New Year. She also recommended good photo locations and spoke to each of us at some stage to get to know where we are from.The shrine feels like a quiet and calmer venue compared to the nearby palaces and was a relaxing tour to end a hectic day of palace touring. I got good value from the combined palaces and Jongmyo shrine ticket."
14,3.0,"One of the six places to visit if you buy the Palace Pass for W10,0000, like the other five, this is a complete rebuild of what stood here centuries ago. It's all rather samey, with the same decor everywhere and none of the buildings are open to visit. You just wander the nice gardens and the courtyards. There is a small museum right of the entry gate which is well worth seeing, but you have to take your shoes off."
15,5.0,Interesting place to know more about Korean culture. Good to have guided tour inside. Very well protected. Landscaping is also wonderful. Relaxing place. But after visiting here starts to wonder what is written in those tablets.
16,5.0,This is a beautiful serene place in Seoul buried in history and home of lots of ancient traditions. I had the pleasure of having a great guide who explained many details that otherwise would have gone unnoticed. This is a great tour of only an hour and for a bargain price!
17,4.0,"I visited this shrine on a Monday. Note it is closed on Tuesdays.Visits are by guided tour only except on Saturdays and the last Wednesday of every month. If you choose a guided tour note that it takes about an hour and there are only four tours in English per day, at 1000 and every two hours after. The visit costs W1000. There are notices in English if you decide to go for a self-guided tour.Note that there are no people buried here. It contains shrine tablets of the kings and queens. The buildings are not lavishly adorned which is supposed to reflect the solemnity of the shrine.There are 7 buildings, two of which are small. The main hall is the biggest and most impressive of the buildings.Well worth a visit."
18,4.0,It's quiet compared to other palaces because it's only allowed guided tour inside. The story about Korean history is interesting. It is not as beautiful as other palaces as limited access and smaller. Need to check time schedule before coming to save time. Best visit is in Autumn.
19,3.0,"I got off the bus at Jongro in front of Jongmyo Shrine and saw the Unesco sign, I did not pay to get in."
20,3.0,It you are time poor then skip this one. The buildings are impressive but miss the finer details of the palace's.  Much of the place is just painted red. Entrance is from the south of the park.
21,4.0,"With a designated stone pathway for the spirits (I guess the royal spirits of the Joseon Dynasty) to walk on, I assume the grounds of this shrine are ""considered sacred"" and that may be for the reason that on these grounds are two ""long buildings"" that house the royal tablets of all the Joseon kings (not exactly sure though what those tablets consist of & what they look like since the buildings cannot be entered).  And the environment here was ""absolutely peaceful"" which I would say is partly due to the somewhat-wooded nature of the place (quite a number of trees on the grounds & in the vicinity) and partly due to the control on the number of visitors at a time in the way of a guided tour which I'm pretty sure they only do one tour at a time (there were only about 15 people in the tour that I was a part of).The tour lasted an hour with the main stops being the two ""long buildings"" where the tablets are stored (as mentioned above); and for those of you who like me have also been to Sanjusangen-do Temple in Kyoto, Japan, you'll find these two long buildings here (which by the way are ""quite identical"" to one another) look quite similar to the long building there that houses a thousand multi-armed Kannons; the difference here though is that each of these two long buildings has a ""big stage"" in front (connected to the building) which is kind of paved with stones although I'm not sure what the purpose of those stages is.Coming by subway, the nearest station is Jongno 3-ga (on Lines 1, 3 & 5) which is just about a 5-minute walk from the Shrine.  And as mentioned above, you can only go in as part of a guided tour (except I think on like one day of the week when you don't need to be in a tour, but I'm not sure if they still limit the number of people at a time on that day), so be mindful of the tour times especially if you want to be in a tour according to the ""language of your choice"" (one of the English tours is at 4 pm, but I got there close to 3 pm and couldn't wait for the 4-pm tour so just went with the 3-pm Chinese tour).  And as for the ticket, I suggest getting an ""integrated ticket"" for 10,000 won which covers this shrine and four of the five palaces of the city (namely Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung & Deoksugung) and which is valid for like a month; do keep in mind though that Gyeongbokgung & this shrine are closed on Tuesdays and the other three palaces are closed on Mondays, so what I did during my week in Seoul (four days actually) is I did Gyeongbokgung & this shrine on Monday and the other three palaces on Tuesday."
22,4.0,"- visited November 2016- it may be a good bargain to purchase the Royal Palace Pass, worth 10000 won, which includes entrance to Jongmyo, plus four other palaces- atmosphere was solemn and quiet, which, for me, is good for taking a long walk- it was late afternoon and almost closing time when I was able to visit so there were few people and better photo ops- wasnt able to take guided tour, but i think it would have been better with a guided tour"
23,3.0,"I went on this tour today with an English-speaking guide. I think if you don't have someone to explain the history and significance of the shrine, you will really miss out. The price of admission is only 1000 won and the guide is free. So then you get all the interesting facts and have a better understanding of the buildings. The tour is only about an hour."
24,5.0,This royal shrine was built in the 14 century for kings & queens of the Joseon dynasty. Jongmyogerye is one of the oldest ancestral rites maintained today.
25,3.0,"I found this place by accident as I was walking from Jongno 2-ga to Changdeokgung. On the map it showed a large garden in front of Changdeokgung so I walked near. In fact it is not part of Changdeokgung but is a most-respected shrine. The ticket office could not say much English except ""Conducted tour"". Anyway I bought a ticket for 1000 KRW and was fortunate that a tour just began. I followed the group (a class of young students) but could not understand what the Korean tour guide said. The place is historical and there are two main buildings. The architecture appears to be quite simple and straight-forward and is unlike that of Changdeokgung. Interesting place, as it is not commercialized like the other tourist hot-spots. Saw some small wild animals (squirrels, etc.) It is probably worth visiting if you have time after seeing the nearby palaces; just a 10-minute walk from Changdeokgung along a quiet lane."
26,5.0,"This is one of the most popular attractions in Seoul. You get the sense of Deja Vu. Access is available to connecting palaces and attractions. Not that expensive to enter. Good metro connection at Jongno, lines 1, 3 & 5"
27,4.0,"Once you entered the park, a silence surrounded you in the middle of the city. I went on a Monday with an English guided tour. The guided tour is indeed helpful as there isn't actually a lot to see by yourself. The explanation helps to understand the buildings and the park. 1k Won is nothing to discuss about it further the nice tour guide speaks very good English."
28,4.0,It was amazing. A great place of attraction. I would say it is comparable to the Gyeongbukgong Palace. We werent allowed to enter without the tour guide and guided tours were only allowed at certain timings. The whole place seemed mysterious and sacred. Relatively cheap entry. It did not seem as popular with tourists as the main palaces.
29,4.0,"It's worth seeing the main square alone, and the entry fee is very reasonable, it's a unique site as it's a memorial to many of Korea's past kings and queens, but it was a bit underwhelming to see this after visiting Changdeokgung Palace.Unfortunately apart from Saturdays when you can walk free (and Tuesdays when it's closed), you're forced to join a tour as they only open the front gate when a tour guide is there. I did try to wander off and see things for myself, but a guide approached me and (rather politely) asked me to return to the tour as there were many CCTV cameras around... whatever that means. I'm not sure if he thought I was going to break the rules or something. Not to worry, I left halfway through the tour and no-one was too concerned when I went for the exit.You can join a non-English speaking tour if you arrive outside the English tour times, as the ticket inspector didn't seem to care what time I entered. Check the official website for tour times."
30,4.0,"This shrine requires a tour to visit but the price is low and the tour guide explains this site well and timing is perfect (not too slow or too rushed). The place feels a bit quiet and empty (especially if you visit in winter as opposed to spring). This place is historically very important and a must see if you have at least 3 days in Seoul. get the Seoul palace pass and this is included (4 palaces plus Jongymo Shrine and the secret garden tour for 10,000 Korean Won)."
31,4.0,On Sundays you need to take a guided tour. English is every two hours. I came at 4pm. The place is beautiful and serene and the guide explained very nicely everything.
32,5.0,I didn't realize the time table for the English speaking group (12hrs)... I had to go on pretending to know Korean 12:20pm as I would be running late for my next schedule. It's a must to enter with a group except on specific holidays. Luckily the English group was running a little behind schedule so I got to join in!Beautiful peaceful shrine with detailed Korean architecture. One of the must dos!
33,4.0,"It is a walk from the nearby Chandeokgung Palace. There are English guided tours. The venue can only be visited with a guided tour, which is really very interesting The shiorne itself is closed to the public, but a spirit chamber has been constructed for visitors to appreciate. The whole tour takes about an hour. Guidelines are given to respect the shrine area,a s this is a traditional religious monument. Buy a combination ticket for all Palaces and the shrine for 10.000 KRW."
34,5.0,"This place is often overlooked sadly by other attractions in Seoul but honestly was one of the most meaningful places I went in my time there - such insight into the long and rich past of the Joseon Kingdom and traditions, and really into modern Korea and tradition. I also love how is so well priced and entrance is strictly via guided tour so you can get great pictures and all the information required and more. A truly comprehensive understanding and a guide that takes the time to let you explore and explains. Truly a worth Unesco world heritage site and also has a intangible component which is rare to have one place associated with both tangible and intangible world heritage. A absolute must do in Seoul!!"
35,4.0,"For the rushed tourist, there are several things to say. First, the neighbouring King's palace or the secret garden on the other side are bigger and there is more to see and do. That said, the main building in the spiritual sanctuary is the most prolifically profiled place in Seoul and worth seeing for that alone. Second, like the Secret Garden, there are regularly timed intervals with a guided tour. You can not simply come and go as you please (as you can at the royal palace). There is also an English guided tour at 2PM. Amazingly peaceful place. As it should be given it is the memorial shrine to countless kings and royalty."
36,3.0,"you pay the entrance, then you do your tour, ask for the informative paper for History details, and let wish you will find the English Guide there at the exact time you get there"
37,5.0,"Linked to history, but mainly to culture and traditions. Check for the free guided tours in advance. You will learn a lot about past and present traditions. Quiet, lovely place. Be respectful."
38,4.0,"You can only view on a guided tour basis and I joined the  English tour for 1000 won, which is amazing value. This is where the spirits of  the Joneson Dynesty remain. You'll be shown various places where their spirits are stored and there are some interesting stories to hear. this is another part of the history and gives further insight on how they lived and died."
39,2.0,"This place is a graveyard of the kings of Choseon Dynasty. But there are no great tombs or treasures. You might be disappointed, but that is the tradition of Korea. I don't want to recommend this place to foreign visitors."
40,4.0,"This shrine in the heart of Seoul is a nice attraction -peaceful park, with interesting history.  However, unless you have Korean heritage, it might be a bit less attractive than many other, truly fascinating sights in the capital.  Guided tours only.  In July 2015, it was free admission, like many other sites in Seoul - well appreciated !"
41,2.0,"The background to this site is very interesting, being the repository of the tablets and seals of deceased kings and queens, but the actual site is quite boring. The sacred nature of Jongmyo means that all of the shrine buildings are locked and there is nothing to see! The little exhibition building had a display about what the shrine looks like when offerings are made to the ancestors and there were some animations of the ceremonies that still take place here, but it isn't like seeing the real thing. A great disappointment."
42,5.0,Very peaceful park. Superb buildings for rituals wherein kings honor their ancestors. If you go on Saturday you do not need to take a tour. Other days you can only visit with a tour.
43,4.0,"It was okay. The shrine wasn't so big and there were more older people. But I was there when the Royal Court Festival was being held, so there are a few activities. And there are the reenactment of the royal palace ritual. Oh, don't walk on the pathways. It was for spirit. I did that and some older Korean people glared at me and told me not to do that."
44,5.0,"Green space with many ancient buildings. Informative as to how the deceased kings are remembered in the past and up to the present. When I visited the place, there was not many crowd. I would recommend people to visit this shrine."
45,4.0,"Jongmyo is a home to many ancestor kings and royals of Korea from 13th century AD.There are 5 main open preserved buildings in a vast walk able area with signboards in Korean and English languages about importance of each, ancient rituals and prayers performed to keep about 50  sprits/souls in peace and happy.There is a small hall with comfortable floor seats where one can watch a 30 minute video explaining Jongmyo importance, reminding one of our duty to our forefathers- queens are missing.Guides in English,Japanese, Chinese and Korean are available to groups at fixed timings. Look up their website and enjoy your meeting with souls.Entry Free on Wednesdays.USD 1 on other days."
46,3.0,I bought the combo ticket that included tickets to the other shrines as well. On most days you need a guided tour and can't walk around freely. I was put with a Korean guide so I didnt understand a word she said. Luckily I had an app that was a guide for me. Its a huge complex with lots of open space. Beautiful to see but its not something I would say you HAVE to see. It is totally skipable.
47,5.0,"I bought the combined tickets for the four main palaces in Seoul and almost didnt notice that I also had a ticket for visiting Jongmyo Shrine. It is only possible to visit it on a guided tour, which actually is pretty good cause otherwise (personally) I would not get half the history and meaning of that place. It is a very quiet and interesting place to visit and learn a bit more about Korean culture. Definitely recommend it."
48,5.0,I love the serenity of this place where tablets of the past Korean kings are placed in the long hall. I would definitely recommend this place for those who wish to learn the history. Do note that you can't go in on your own as you need the local tour guide from this place to bring you around. This is some sort of a sacred ground so be respectful and follow the guide's instructions.
49,1.0,"As others have said, one has to visit this shrine with a guided tour. Fair enough. The problem is that, as a foreigner, one is compelled to take the tour in English, and only a few are offered, so bear that in mind before wasting your time.I had just enough time to join a tour in Japanese. Waiting for the English tour would not have left me enough time to head back to the hotel, take the airport limousine, and catch my flight. I tried to explain this to the guides and the ticket sellers, but they would not listen at all. As soon as they learned that I do not speak Japanese well, they declared that it was ""IMPOSSIBLE"" for someone like me to join that tour (their words and emphasis). They kept shouting the word IMPOSSIBLE to my face and they were increasingly rude and close minded.(I am Mexican, as a matter of fact. There is no tour in Spanish. Would it be ""IMPOSSIBLE"" for me to visit this shrine if I did not speak English?)I think that this decision is discriminatory. I had already paid my ticket (I had a combination pass that includes Jongmyo). I just wanted to enter and take a look. Of course, it's always a plus to be able to understand what the guide says, but entry should not be forbidden in case one does not. This is not a classroom!There are signs in four languages in all the other shrines. Had they needed me to understand something in particular (such as ""take off your shoes"" or ""do not take pictures"") I would've been able to understand.I share this with you here because there's no space for comments on the official website.One sometimes wonders if national anxiety regarding the history of Japanese-Korean relations is having too much influence on Korean museums. Might it be possible that different information is being conveyed in different languages?"
50,4.0,"This shrine is small. You can only enter this shrine through guided tour so make sure you check the time of the guided tour before you arrive, otherwise you will have to wait for your tour. The shrine is relatively small, and most of the doors are closed (off limit for tourist). However, like the guide said, you come to this shrine to understand the thinking and culture of Korean, not so much about the shrine itself; the shrine is only a representation of their thinking and logic. So I think it is worth visiting if you got some spare time."
51,4.0,This is an interesting shrine in the centre of seoul near the other palaces. You have to go with a guide and she gives an interesting insight into the Confucian view of death and the importance of respecting parents and ancestors. The buildings are set by large courtyards where celebrations are held twice a year and it is a very peaceful place with many trees.
52,3.0,"I visited on a Saturday and was misled by the reviews which said this was a guided tour only. True except on Saturdays!Without explanations from a guide, you get the point about the use of this shrine but it is not so interesting. Yet as other visitors wrote, this place is sober and elegant.Closed on tuesday, english guided tour only at 10:00, 11:00, 14:00, 15:00 except on saturday. You can just visit by yourself without a guide and anytime on saturday."
53,5.0,"The guide gave us an interesting insight. She explained a lot about the kings, sacred places,...The place itself is very sober because it's the place where the spirit of the kings rest but it's still very interesting to see.Closed on tuesday, english guided tour are at 10:00, 11:00, 14:00, 15:00. Be carefull, except on saturday, you can only enter the shrine with a guided tour! You can just visit by yourself (without a guide and anytime) on saturday.Fee : 1000won"
54,4.0,"The only day you can enter the Shrine without going on a tour is Saturday so if you are there on another day you will need to time it with a tour in your chosen language, the tour takes about 50 minutes. The english tour was very informative and gave a good insight to the Korean culture and belief on their deceased and without the tour I think you would miss the true meaning of the Shrine.It was very peaceful and with the autumn colours in the trees it made for a beautiful backdrop. I would recommend buying the combo ticket for 10,000 Won.  It includes Gyeonbokgung, Changdeokgung, Secret Garden, Changgyeonggung and Deosugung. When I was at the shrine there was no line to buy tickets but all the other palaces was quite long so get the combo ticket from here."
