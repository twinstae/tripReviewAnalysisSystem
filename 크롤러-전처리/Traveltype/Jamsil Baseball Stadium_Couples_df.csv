0,5.0,"First time catching a baseball game live. Atmosphere is electrifying, and seated at the exciting zone adds another level of fun. Ushers are friendly and directions to seats, washroom etc are clear enough for us.Go go Doosan Bear!"
1,5.0,"The stadium wasn’t even close to full on our Thursday night baseball game but the atmosphere was amazing! The Koreans love their baseball and honestly, it’s infectious. The cheerleaders are such good fun as is the food and beer culture. It’s also super cheap to go too versus the US."
2,4.0,"A visit to a baseball game is definitely worthwhile. In our case, it was LG Twins vs. NC Dinos, who were well supported for an away team. In comparison to US baseball games, in our experience the audience is much more lively and consistently cheering on their team. Tickets were available at the stadium on game day, which was possible due to it being a non-rivalry game against an out-of-town opponent. Third-base upper deck tickets were approx $15 each, with good view of the game. Plenty of food and drinks available inside but feel free to bring your own as well."
3,5.0,"It doesn’t matter whether you are a baseball fan or not, you will love going to a game in Jamsil. There are multiple teams that play there so there’s almost always a game. Spend a night as a Doosan Bears fan or cheer on the LG Twins. The fans are awesome and really get into the songs and dances for each player. Try to get in the upper seats along the first base line.Go to a baseball game because:- Tickets are pretty cheap (about 15 USD)- You can bring in your own food and drinks. - The food options there are pretty affordable (for stadium food)- The fans are amazing. See how Koreans enjoy this sport!"
4,4.0,Since I was in Korea for a week we got really lucky and noticed baseball was on and did some research. It was really hard or near impossible to buy tickets online as nothing is in English but you can come 30 mins before the game and heaps of tickets still available. We got to sit near the middle for around $20 AUD. Very cool atmosphere and lots of fried chicken options. Worth coming even for a few hours (game can take hours)z
5,5.0,Like baseball? In Korea? Like beer? Then this place is for you. Its an airy ballpark with cheap seats and cheap drinks. Front row seats at field level are ~30 USD. The cheerleading is fun to watch as well. Easy to get to via subway and/or bus.
6,5.0,"Great experience for my girlfriend and I. As Western Canadians, we aren't really into baseball. But we happen to be walking by the stadium on our last day and said screw it, lets go in. Bought our great seats for approx $11 CAD, what a deal! The people selling the tickets didn't have a great grasp at English, but they still made seat selection and buying tickets fairly straight forward. I highly recommend seeing a Korean baseball game. What a surprise!"
7,5.0,"Hands down one of the most fun experiences i've ever had at a baseball game. I've been lucky to witness the SF Giants win 3 championships, and have been to playoff games, but the atmosphere in Korea is amazing. Everyone is engaged and having fun. It seems like every little thing has a fight song, you can't help but smile and enjoy yourself.If you are going to Korea, I would strongly suggest going to a baseball game."
8,5.0,"I am actually not a fan of baseball, in fact I know nothin about it. My hub is one and he wanted to come and catch a match since we are in Seoul. We were there for Doosan Bears VS NC match on a Friday. Bought the tix about 1.5 hours before the match (6.30pm) at 32k in total. Pretty good seats. The koreans were very enthusiastic and cheering for their teams. We joined Doosan Bear fans and boy, we had sooooo much fun! We were cheering alongside with them and I quickly became a fan! There were lots of fried chicken sold outside as well as beer! The match ended at 9.30pm but it didn’t feel long for us. Would love to be there again!"
9,4.0,"It was our first baseball match, and we decided to go for Twins vs. Bears.We know nothing about baseball, but still enjoyed the game. The atmosphere was great: continuous cheering and chanting from both supporters sides. It was great fun to witness an almost full stadium in continuous rumbling. Ticket prices range from 7,000 yo 70,000 krw.Tip: to avoid direct sunlight, pick the Bears supporters side of the stadium."
10,4.0,"What a hoot!   We saw the Giants play the Bears.   Full house of 26,000 singing, cheering and chanting fans made this great fun.  This is a cultural experience!   We had cheap outfield seats because reserved were sold out.   In the 6th inning the visiting Giant fans filled plastic bags wth air and wore them like hats.  It's a thing....     I recommend it.   The stadium is at ""sports complex"" Subway and bus stop"
11,5.0,"Went there to see the LG Twins vs KT Wiz. Baseball-wise, it wasn't very exciting, but the overall show and atmosphere make it worth a visit! Tickets were around $11 per person, but the best thing was that you could bring in drinks and food from outside. There are many small street food vendors and fast food places outside the stadium, where you can stock up before you go inside. Please note that you can only bring in plastic bottles. However there are plenty convenience stores inside the stadium, where you can buy a liter of beer for less than $4, making the whole game a very fun and inexpensive experience! It needs to be said, that with the start of the 8th inning, you cannot buy alcohol any more. If you're in Seoul, this is a must do!"
12,5.0,"A must do if in Seoul!!!  It was an amazing experience watching the families, fans and performers. It is nothing like the baseball games that we have in North America.  First of all, you can bring in your own food and drinks.  Yes, booze!  Everyone brings in coolers full of food and booze.  The fans are crazy.  They sing along with the performers to the different chants during the game.  It’s super affordable.  Even the cheapest seats were not too bad."
13,5.0,Great stadium. Amazing fanbase! Koreans really enjoy baseball like no other in the World. Clearly the main sport in Korea. Attending a baseball is a must while in Seoul.
14,5.0,"After reading the reviews from others, my husband & I decided to see a game. What a hoot! After this, American baseball games will seem as staid as golf tournaments. Although there was a chance of rain and the stadium wasn't full, those who were there were lively and my head was swivelling back and forth from the game to the MC and cheerleaders.  My recommendation? Go to a game!"
15,5.0,"I love baseball as it is exciting when my team is playing but I was excited when I visited Jamsil Baseball Stadium and I didn’t know a single player or where the visiting team was from. The crowd is unbelievable. The game was meaningless as I found out later it wouldn’t impede one of the teams from advancing to the playoffs. Regardless, the crowd sang and chanted throughout the entire game. I’ve been to a soccer match and it was pretty much the same thing but this is baseball. I’ve never seen this much excitement save for a World Series game in baseball. Then to top that off, there were these hot cheerleaders that danced and performed throughout the game. I’m glad I had on my sunglasses or my wife would have been pissed hahaha! The food was very cheap, the tickets were cheap, the ride on the metro to the front door step of the stadium was cheap and the entire experience was priceless. I HIGHLY ADVISE if you are in Seoul try and find out if there is a baseball game being played and DO NOT MISS OUT! You will see baseball in a whole new light."
16,5.0,"Awesome experience!   The Korean baseball experience is unlike any sporting event I've ever been to.  The fans, led by professional cheerleaders, are rowdy and politely obnoxious, taunting the other team with chants and cheers, singing and dancing.  Thundersticks are available for inexpensive purchase, and are highly recommended to enhance your cheering experience.  Fans come dressed in team jerseys, along with silly glasses and wigs, and put the New York Yankees ""Bleacher Creatures"" cheering section to shame.  It's important to point out that although the cheering is loud and spirited, the games are still extremely family-friendly.  There's no throwing of beer bottles, cursing, and inappropriate drunkenness like you might see at other events. Beer and food are inexpensive and served in giant portions - make sure to try the popcorn style chicken in a sweet and spicy sauce!"
17,5.0,My husband and I went to watch a game and the stadium was the best part of the experience. You can bring in your own food or eat from the many restaurants. There are coffee shops and tickets are cheap!
18,5.0,"I am a former professional baseball player and coach, so catching a game at Jamsil was a must for my wife and me and it did not disappoint!  The quality of play on the field is good - equivalent to High-A or Double A minor leagues in the U.S. - but the entertainment value is off the charts!  It is very different than catching a game back home and we loved every minute of it! The environment outside the stadium before and after the game is lively and the fans are full of energy and enthusiasm throughout the game.  Do yourself a favor and see a game while in Seoul!!!"
19,5.0,"I currently live in Japan, where baseball games are super exciting (think European soccer/football). I was not disappointed! It was amazing! I'm not sure if I can go back home and watch a game now that I've been at games in Asia. Songs, dancing, cheers, cheap food/drink... It's an absolute must (even if you're not a baseball/sports person)!!!!! GO TWINS!!!"
20,5.0,"This was hands down one of my favorite day trips in Seoul! The crowd was so amped up (always is, Koreans love baseball) and it was definitely a glimpse of Korean culture. Its also really cheap-you can buy tickets for 7,000 KRW and they're still awesome seats! Bring sun glasses and an umbrella and lots of water-you can bring your own food and beer into the stadium."
21,4.0,"Great evening out at the equivalent of a AAA ballpark in the U.S., but much more enthusiastic fans. Americans would be appalled to find singing and chanting like at an MLS game but it was great fun even though the hated Samsung Lions came back against Bears' relievers to pull out the win."
22,4.0,What a terrific place to watch baseball. 2 professional home teams to watch on various dates. It would be hard to imagine a MLB team allowing you to enter the park carrying a complete meal to enjoy while watching the game. The quality of the play is probably equal to AAA ball.. Very enjoyable!!
23,5.0,"There's so much fan cheering that you forget you are at a baseball game.  Each player has his own song & when he is at bat, the fans sing his song.The cheerleaders, music & drums create so much energy. Easy to get to with the metro."
24,5.0,"The spontaneous crowd and cheerleaders made the baseball match very exciting. We felt the need to stand up and cheer along with them even though we didn't know Korean! The ticket sales can be a bit tricky because everything is written in Korean. Just follow the queue and tell the person behind the counter roughly where you want to sit. After getting your tickets, go grab some fast food, chips and beer and enjoy the game!"

30,4.0,"If you've never been to a Korean baseball game, it's an experience you shouldn't miss. The crowds are extremely energetic, all of the seats have excellent views, and there are cheerleaders. The tickets are cheap and you can buy them directly at the stadium on gameday. Some quick tips, buy your beer and food PRIOR to entering the stadium. There are no rules against bringing outside food into the stadium. However, if you need to buy something inside the prices are extremely reasonable. The prices are just MORE reasonable outside. Also, upon exiting the subway there is a ticket booth that everyone will be waiting to use, this line is extremely long. If you walk to the left of this booth about 25m there is another booth that is generally empty."
31,5.0,"if there is baseball match, you should come and watch the game. the atmosphere is great. the korean supporters are great"
32,5.0,"I'm not much of a fan of baseball but found this game to be quite quick, interesting and at a reasonably high skill level. The small stadium size made it quite an intimate experience which was also quite enjoyable. Each team has its own cheer squad which adds to the event, there are the traditional ""cheerleader"" girls but also men, drums, costumed mascots and that sort of stuff. I found it made the experience a lot more interesting and wish I'd asked for seats closer to them. Food and drinks are as disappointing as any other sports stadium in the world. However you can take your own beer, other drinks or food in to save some money and have better food. We ate cold Burger King burgers."
33,5.0,"I am an American baseball fan, but I don't think that's a pre-requisite for enjoying baseball at Jamsil in Korea. It's just a really fun, and different experience, and Koreans love their baseball, so, no better way to do as the locals do. I could not figure out how to pre-purchase tickets, so we go to the stadium two hours before the game and waited in a massive line for GA tix. We got them, about $11/ea, but when we got inside, there was literally not one seat available. They WAY oversell the stadium. Not to worry, you can put yourself anywhere there is a bit of space that will fit you. It's crazy! During the game, everyone bangs sticks and chants and cheers. Also, plenty of food and alcohol is on sale both inside and outside the stadium, and you get in and out privileges, and, you can bring alcohol from outside into the stadium! Baseball at Jamsil was one of my top favorite things we did there. Full blog post, with video, here:http://postandjones.com/2014/08/22/seoul-baseball-in-korea-i-said-baseball-in-korea/"
34,5.0,This was great fun. Get there early to get good tickets but they are cheap as is food and drinks. You can also bring your own beer. The fans get right into the game and you can't help but get swepted up into their enthusiasm. Clear highlight of Seoul.
35,5.0,"I don't even like baseball, but we had a great time watching the LG Twins and the Samsung Lions play. The songs and dancing are a lot of fun! Grab a pair of the sticks that make noise!"
36,5.0,Went to a baseball game of the Doosan Bears (they have an english website and it's easy to find the schedule) The atmosphere was great. Both the home and away fans cheered their teams with chants. We got the cheapest tickets but the sight was still good and we could move freely and choose some other free seats. Drinks were not too expensive and it was possible to bring food from outside. I am not so interested in Baseball (we didn't stay till the end) but can still recommend it.
37,4.0,"We went to a game recently while in seoul. Price start at 8,000 won.  We paid 12,000won each and got front row tickets. You can buy food and drinks within the stadium. Atmosphere was great. Game lasted over 3 hours so good value for money. And our team won!!"
38,4.0,LG: DooSan match is really exciting. Closed by subway station.
39,5.0,"Maybe you were on the fence about going to a Korean pro baseball game. How different could it be, you say? Go. You won't regret it. Take the subway and get off at the Sports Complex stop. It dumps you right into the outside of the stadium. It's impossible to miss it. Walk up to the ticket booth and get some cheap seats, the $12 red section seats in the 200 level are great because they're in the middle of the action. But first, peruse the thriving street market set up in the parking lot for something to eat to bring into the game. Or pick up a few cans of beer. Not brave enough to try street food, they've got KFC and Burger King at the stadium. Once you're in, its like nothing you've ever seen. The baseball is fun to watch, high-minor league level with lots of offense, but its the fans who are the real show. The stadium is split in two with the first base line supporting the home team and the third base line supporting the visitor. There are competing cheering squads staked out at the base of the 200 levels urging their partisans on and the crowd offers up chants and correographed cheers to the booming sounds of club and rock music. What a spectacle."
40,5.0,"The fan experience at a baseball game in Seoul is incredible.  The atmosphere is more like a European soccer match with the crowd chanting and singing.  There's also cheerleaders that lead the crowd and they make the most noise when their team is up to bat, which is quite the contrast to baseball in the U.S.  Definitely check out baseball game in Seoul if you get the chance.  So glad we did."
41,5.0,Attending a Korean baseball game is an experience unlike any other baseball game you have ever attended. The Koreans redefine the idea of exuberant fans and the atmosphere in the stadium is absolutely amazing. I am not much of a baseball fan but still thoroughly enjoyed my visit to Jamsil Stadium and am planning to visit again before I leave Korea.
42,5.0,"The atmosphere is absolutely amazing, you don't need to be an avid baseball fan to get how brilliant this actually is. If you like sitting outside, eating amazing stodgy food, drinking cheap beer and seeing a truck load of excitable Koreans going mental (who doesn't?) then you really need to go here. I usually hate sports but even I got to figure out what was going on and became really engaged. There's loads of food options, easy to come and go as you please. Loads of booze if you want it. Easy to navigate with loads of signage in English and English speaking staff. Very easy to get to on the subway (has its own stops) Killer merch and electric atmosphere.The cheerleading and the chants are so unique, it just makes it such an amazing, fun night out.Wish I could've gone more than once."
43,5.0,"""The stadium visit will be memorable due to two factors. Firstly the match witnessed a nail biting tight finish. Secondly, the stadium was a place that had all the latest and modern facilities one could have ever thought of. The stadium has signs and boards placed all over the place to guide even a new visitor. I personally did not feel a single requirement to ask for directions from people. I tried and used my own common sense first to find the required enclosure and then to take exit.The stadium was full packed and accommodated a large number of people. Stalls of food items were present and amazingly you can get any food item of your choice from the stalls set up there. There were some people who were crazy food lovers and I saw them taking more interest in food than the match. I love this stadium!"""
44,4.0,I have been in Korea for 5 years and i catch a game as much as i can.. The price is cheap and its an experience in itself.. They purchase plastic bats that you fills with air and you band them together instead of clapping. This is non stop through the whole game and the fans are into the game and they cheer and to the wave and its full of energy. I am a Doosan Bears fan so i love to watch them against another good team. We purchase chicken and beer and eat at our seats with everyone else doing the same. Its alot of fun and you never get bored.. Check it out and catch baseball fever!!
45,4.0,"Koreans love baseball. They absolutely love baseball and it is a social event. Go the game and inevitably share soju and make a new friend. There is no way around it. The crowds are crazy, completely into it and cheer most for the home team."
46,5.0,"Another must see in Seoul. We managed to turn up at 2pm to buy tickets for a 5pm game. One of the biggest atmospheres I have ever experienced at a sporting event. Buy a shirt, support a team and hope that they win! (luckily mine did). Go here."
47,5.0,We were looking around the grounds of the 1988 Olympic stadium when we heard a road of cheering at a nearby stadium.  We decided to look into what was going on and learned it was a baseball game.  We bought cheap tickets and sat with the Bears fans.  Wow - the fans are so into the game!  They all knew the chants and were loving every minute.  I recommend attending (if only for a few innings) if there is a game on.
48,5.0,Its a well built stadium in central area and its fun to watch a live match with enthusiastic crowds egging on their team . also food is good in the vicinity of stadium
49,5.0,"Went for a Doosan Bears baseball game and had a brilliant time. The atmosphere from outside the gates was brilliant with beer and pizza for sale. Inside was great too! Baseball is not really my bag, but a cheap and cheerful alternative to the cinema."
