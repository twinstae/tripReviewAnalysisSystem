0,1.0,"The sad saga of my wait in the kitchen community kitchen continued... I believe the duty manager made an appearance.. asking me to go to the front desk!?!Apparently I was a ghost on my first visit.Then Rachel a good natured service staff from the caf√© showed up and also asked me to go to the front deskEventually (for some blizzard reasons of trust... alluded to in the 1st post) Head of Security... Moonlighting as F&B manager showed up with Rachael in tow.Hip Hip Horray.. cabinets unlocked so I can get a knife and chopping board... Lucky I don't need to cook a smorgasbord üòÅüòÖüòÇIt is apparent that guest trust, service or solutions (getting someone to unlock cupboards!) Was not top of the agenda for this cheap... Yet not fully functional nor cheerful site... Be warned that the initial price on Agoda or booking might be attractive.The on site kitchen facilitiy is far from useable unless you wait the better part of 48 mins"

Didn‚Äôt try the food from the various restaurants and cafes as I was full, but the place looks okay for a bite and sightseeing."
2,3.0,"Not gonna lie, this place is pretty cool for photoshooting. Using containers as buding blocks for a shopping and chilling spot, it gives a modern with a funky twist which makes this place stood out from any other place in Seoul.  If you're up for an indie-esque kind of photos, this place will provide the exact ground (pun intended) to explore the simple yet aesthetically minimalist shots. But it has limited space where one can have their photos being taken. One tip, bright or contrasting colours would fit you well against the blue backdrop."
3,4.0,"This is a fairly small place of two main buildings linked together and made entirely from metal shipping containers. That makes for quite a quirky look from the outside, although you don't notice it that much inside.There are quite a few restaurants and cafes here too so it makes a good spot for some refreshments and a wander around the quirky shops. An hour here would be plenty as its not that big unless you're stopping for a meal."
4,3.0,"This shopping mall is built by stacking up some 200+ containers over 3 stories. It is close to Konkuk Metro Station and recommended in my guidebook, so I went to check it out on a Sunday evening. It's not busy when I got there. I am more interested in the design of the compound than the stuff sold there. Apart from shops/stalls selling clothes/shoes and accessories/knick knacks, there are also a few cafes and restaurants, a bookshop and some exhibition area. There are also food trucks in the courtyard. In the evening, when the place was lit up, it's quite atmospheric. You could consider dropping by if you are in the area."
