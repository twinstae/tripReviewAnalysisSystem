0,4.0,"We read about this amazing hike online and decided to give it a try, as the difficulty level reviewed was ""extremely easy with stairs and marked trail"". As such we went totally unprepared and our mum followed as well. The ascending part was easy with proper stairs but the descending trail was a bit challenging with boulders guided with a rope handrail. We took the fortress/ city wall trail. To get to Inwangsan Mountain, we took the metro (orange line 3) to Gyeongbokgung Station and took a bus at exit 3. Walk straight after exiting and the bus stop is on your right. Take either bus number 7212, 1020 or 7022 and alight at Jahamun Museum stop(bus duration around 10mins).  Cross the road on your left and walk all the way uphill and take the Inwangsan Jarak-gil trail. Upon arriving the police post, cross the road to the wooden stairs. Your hiking trail starts here. As there are no shops or toilet, it is advisable to bring some water and sip when needed. We took about an hour to reach the peak and another hour down (look out for Dongnimum Station after the descent) It should be faster if there are no elderly hiker. There are many nutmeg trees and nutmegs during our hike in the summer. Air was fresh and there are good views of the city. I specially like the fortress wall. It was a very enjoyable hike, despite we wearing the wrong gear."
1,5.0,"350m high, 4km long, well maintained and safe  hiking course to see President House, Old Palaces and core of Seoul.  Walk along with castle and see all around of Seoul.  It is beautiful Seoul.  Near this mountain, many famous testaurants. Walking with children is no problem.  If you like temple, visit Temple in the Rock, very small but pesceful."
2,4.0,"We started at Dongnimmun station.  Go out exit two and head straight to the first street.  At first street take a left and follow it up through the buildings/apartment complex to the trail head.  You will be going uphill.  As you get closer it will get steeper and there will be stairs.  First stop is the shamanist shrine and Seonbawi Rocks.  There is a shrine at the rocks and we worked our way around the rocks and back to the trail that follows the wall up the mountains.  From the Seonbawi Rocks, you can get a view of the Seodaemun prison.  Also around the rocks are various shaman sites with writings over the rocks and as you work your way back toward the wall you will pass numerous shaman sites as well.  We then hiked to the peak and came down another way.  The trail is steep, but we did it with a 10, 8, and 6 year old.  If you do have children be very cautious as there are numerous drop offs.  I carried the two year old on my back.  The views of Seoul are very good so make sure you go on a clear day.  You overlook the Gyeongbukgung palace and can also look north to the Bukhansan mountains. As we came down a different trail we used the Gyeongbukgung subway station to get back.  Due to the mountains location, you can only take pictures in certain directions for security reasons.  Bathrooms were available at beginning and end of the trail."
