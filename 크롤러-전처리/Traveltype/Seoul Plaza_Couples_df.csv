0,3.0,"This is a lovely plaza, located just next to the beautiful city hall.However, there was absolutely nothing going on in the plaza during our visit, which was a shame."
1,3.0,"Seoul Plaza is a square shaped plaza with a an open-ground space in its centre. Situated next to City Hall in the hear of downtown Seoul, this is where free shows, concerts and other events are held throughout the year. There is even a ice-rink during winter holiday season. During our recent visit, we found Seoul Plaza ground to be in a bit poor shape. The grounds were well-trodden upon with much more dirt/mud surface than grass.  It was much preferable walking on the pavement around the plaza than directly upon the centre ground space. A stage had been setup on the pavement area next to the City Hall, where a dance performance of sorts was taking place. Plenty of seats were set up but the event seemed to have only attracted a small audience. We took watch for a few minutes before being on our way.  In the end, it really depends on what is on schedule when it comes to Seoul Plaza. Best to check the Seoul Plaza website to find out what is on during the time of your visit. Or when passing through the area, just have a quick look to see if anything interesting is taking place."

3,2.0,"This is just a wide plaza that tends to have exhibitions during weekends, demonstrations and sit-ins during weekdays, and a large ice-rink during winter. Nothing much else really. I had a good view of the square from my room at The Westin Chosen, and for much of the days that I was there it was just a peaceful sit-in (read:protest) going on."
4,2.0,I think this place is just boring and there is not much to see or do. I would expect more from such a central plaza. The space could have been used on more innovative way.
