0,4.0,The park offers  360Â° view of Seoul and the Han. Worth noting is how the park came about. From being a landfill to becoming an attraction tells us that nothing is impossible with political will and determination.
1,5.0,"If u want Seoul pictures different from all your friends', then this is the place to go!  your pictures will come out looking Instagrammable too!Take to World Cup Stadium Station and then walk towards Haneul Park. u have the option to take the buggy shuttle bus up onstead of climbing the steep slope up. The bus is highly recommended and cost only KRW1000 for a round trip. The field is huge so no worries about crowd. Each one has his own little patch of muhly grass to disappear into and take pictures!"
2,4.0,We went mid May and the grass was knee-high. Very important to check when the grass is scheduled for cutting or else you risk missing out on the pretty backdrop.  There ware signages about FROGS so beware if you ware one like me who gets creeped out by them.  Very important to enter at the base of the hill and not anywhere else... why? because that's where you can ride the buggy up the hill instead of treading 950meters UPHILL :)  Trust me you will want to ride it ;)
3,5.0,"It's a place where all garbage that are collected from the city of Seoul. At that time we're using coal briquet for heating in winter. Ashes after its burn are collected and dumped here then where was an outskirt of city 40+ years ago rises to make a huge hill.It's well gardened with trees and flowers and becomes a beautiful garden hill. When in the fall, it's fully covered with reeds that is great.Many shutterbugs go there to take nice landscape photos with changing leaves."

5,4.0,Haneul Park is a good park to enjoy and relax only after you climbed a series of ladders going to the top.A good exercise. The park offers a good view of the surroundings especially of the stadium and has a lot of different trees and plants in contrasting colors.
6,5.0,Great park to get away from the buzz from Seoul city. Small provision shop with coffee and snacks is available. Best view of Seoul. Good photo opportunities. Still pretty in December.
7,5.0,"I love this place. One of my favorite places in Korea. You can visit with your boyfriend, girlfriend, with your family, even by yourself. You will love it. It makes me feel so fresh, comfortable, and also healthy. Haneul means ""sky"". Love that name too. Good place for a picnic, for taking memorable pictures with the ones that you love. I want to visit this place once again."
8,4.0,"It silver glass session, so we decide to pay a visit here. I suggest take the tram/electric golf cart go up to the hill. Just a small price for it. But if you want to enjoy the night view, then you have to walk down as the tram last stop is 6pm. Quite a long walk from the nearest MRT station but worth it as my country don't have this."
9,5.0,This is a huge nature park on a hill. Flame grass(silver glass) & cosmos area is very beautiful in fall. Really crowded during that time.- One part of World Cup Park that consists of several parks.- You'd better prepare foods in advance. The stadium complex is a good place to buy.- There are mini shuttle buses called as Mangkongi Bus. It's not recommended when there are many visitors. A long queue will make you exhausted waiting.- Great photo spot.
