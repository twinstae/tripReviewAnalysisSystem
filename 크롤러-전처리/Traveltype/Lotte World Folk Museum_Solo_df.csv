Since I did not want to do all these attraction I walk around and saw the entrance to this museum. As the price was only Won 5,000 , I decided to have ad look. I great decision. I spend about 1 1/2 hours in there and got a lot of interesting information about Korean history. The displays are very nice and explanations most of the time also in English. I had a great time!!"

There were lots of colorful, miniature Korean folks from pre-historic age, stone age up to the time of the different dynasties. Looking at the small scale models, I have learned the rich culture of Korea. They also have several Korean restaurants inside the museum.  I think one of the most beautiful museums I have ever been to."

4,4.0,"The entrance is a little hard to locate but the museum itself is fantastic. I have never been to a museum which has so many miniature re-creations before. Everything is expertly made and you'll be able to learn about the history of South Korea from start to present. There are descriptions in English so do not worry if you are an overseas traveler. Price is 5,000 WON, admission is very cheap and you'll learn a lot here. This place is a MUST visit if you're from out of town."
