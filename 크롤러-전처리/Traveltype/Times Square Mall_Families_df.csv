1,5.0,"This is more of a lifestyle and recreational complex than just a mall. Apart from all the usual shopping and entertainment, it houses a cinema multiplex with 12 screens - one of which features the largest screen in the world."
2,5.0,Great mall with a range of brands. Food court provides plenty of food options as well. It is connected from subway through underground shopping mall which further provides range of shopping options including variety of cosmetics brands.
3,4.0,Good place to go if you want to see all the shops you want to go to in one place.  The food court was not bad either as it had the right mix of restaurants.
4,4.0,"If you've been to malls in Asia, this is your little nicer than most malls. But it's still a mall. There was a driving interactive 4x4 racing video game that I did with my son. He drove and thought it was cool. Descent selection of food and a pretty good movie theater. Other than that there are a lot of over priced international branded stores."
5,4.0,Times square mall is good for shopping and surrounded with a lot of good and amazing resturants.Some times have a music show at 12PM.
6,4.0,If you like to shop and walk around indoor than this is the place.  The building is impressive.  I guess they used to have waterfall with led flowing from suspended balls but it's no longer operating.  Pity.

The mall is huge includeing E-mart in Basement 1 and 2, Shinsegae mall for the brand lovers or I should say rich guys. This place is full of live. Recently a electro mart is open besides E-mart. I like that place cause it has some unusual goods which can not be found shopping mall elsewhere.Being a father of a ~2 years old daughter, it would be nice to have kids zone in a big shopping mall. They got a nice one named Dalki. My daughter loved that place and enjoyed a lot ( 15,000 won for 3 hours for a kid and adult is 3000 won per person, which is reasonable I guess). Times Square does have all the brands you want. Great place for watching movie. Food zone was also very nice. Sometimes in weekend, it takes half an hour to park your car in the basement parking lot. Parking is free for first 30 minues, but it could rise up to ~15,000 won if you plan to stay there for 3-4 hours. A good tip is to shop at E-mart, or some other store which help to reduce this parking fee, even free sometimes. Please note that, all shop does not includes in parking fee exemption. This info can be found in the touch screen monitor located near by the escalor. I lost my parking ticket once, but the authorized person was kind enough and he let me go without any fee.Kyobo book store is a nice palce to be for the readers. On weekend, you might see some event going on. Costco and Homeplus is not far away from this mall. I loved it everytime I visited. A nice place to visit while you are in seoul."

9,5.0,"Having this mall attached to our hotel was wonderful.  Many interesting upscale mall-type clothing shops, etc.  Restaurants and food courts spread throughout.  Very safe and clean.  Also has an E-Mart which is like a super Wal-mart, but with even more variety.  I admit, I found it fun to see a Korean Taco Bell that had beer and bulgkoki tacos."
