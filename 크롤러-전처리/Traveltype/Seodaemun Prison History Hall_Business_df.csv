0,5.0,Be prepared to experience the Korean version of Alcatraz except here you will find memorials of those who fought and sacrificed their lives for their people and for their country.  Beautifully preserved early 20c architecture serves as a great reminder of the struggles Korean ancestors endured to bring the country to where it is today.

Most of the signs are in English so I had no troubles understanding. It's a must see if you are in to visiting historical sites."
2,5.0,"Seodaemun is an education in the occupation of Korea by Japan from about 1910 [yes!] to 1945. It's great place to learn about the Korean independence movement, the underground resistance, and their brutal treatment. Seodaemun was a prison a decade before the Second World War! There are four main buildings, all well-worth the walk through. The emphasis here avoids bitterness and revenge and stresses education and forward-looking. It is easily accessible via subway. It has nice amenities, including clean restrooms, refreshments, and a nice gift shop. well worth a visit."
3,4.0,"Visiting here you will see many school children visiting this facility. It is quite a somber experience much like going to the Pearl Harbor Arizona memorial, a bit depressing because this prison is hwere the Japanese housed political prisoners during its occupation of Korea.   but history holds pleasant and difficult memories. This is one of the somber ones. But once you visit here you can hike your boots off by heading uphill to find the remaining route of the wall around Seoul liking up with the Bukhansan national Park route - that was a tremendous full day hike around the outskirts of Seoul."
