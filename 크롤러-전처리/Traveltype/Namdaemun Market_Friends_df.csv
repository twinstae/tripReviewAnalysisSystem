0,2.0,"This is a market mainly focused in optical products, knock off clothes and not very authentic souveniers that are made in China. Go to Gwangjang Market if you are looking for some street foods, Go to Myeongdong if you are planning to do some shopping. Worth a visit if you are trying to get yourself a new pair of glasses, but you will probably be overcharged if you are a foreigner. Bring one of your Korean friends. Since it is very close to Myeongdong maybe a 30 min quick stop would not harm you if you do not expect too much."
1,5.0,"this is one of your must-dos if you visit Seoul, the people, the food and the collies. easy to get to. That’s where you experience the Korean life."
2,2.0,"Most people have said on the internet that you can shop here until the wee hours of the morning, but be warned that vendors DO pack up at 8 or 9PM and then it becomes a dead zone, I have tried going 4 times at night and this is the result, it is best to go during the day."
3,5.0,"Don’t be scared to explore every nook and cranny of this fascinating market. From 10am to 5am you will find many treasures, depending on the time. Also, if you want to practice your haggling skills then this is a good place to start. (Don’t haggle food though; however, don’t me nervous about asking for a big portion.)I’ve come here with family or friends, but keep the little ones close because there is a lot of hustle/bustle taking place. Since it is a traditional style market, try some food you’ve never eaten before. I discovered cow lungs mixed with spicy red sauce and rice is delicious. This is a great place to buy cheap clothes for kids. Also, the silky grandma pants are wild looking and comfortable. I got 2 pair for 5$ once. I wouldn’t take kids here at night, but Seoul is very safe. There might be a lot of drunks singing at the moon, and if you fancy getting drunk and shopping, then by all means shop here. If visiting Korea, then this is wayyyyyyy more of a “korean” experience as opposed to doing something mundane like visiting Seoul Tower. Like I said—-explore. Go in buildings. Walk around. Haggle if you can. Don’t get ripped off. Try something exotic to eat. Howl at the moon with traditional Korean alcohol."
4,5.0,Hair-tail alley is a must visit it was so good I went three times on a seven day trip. Currency exchange rates are better here compared to myeongdong.
5,4.0,"We walked this market a few times while we were in Seoul. Many vendors and stores offering overwhelmingly beauty supplies, sneakers and food etc. Name it, you can find it there. We spent about an hour here the first time and kept going back. We purchased a few souvenirs, teas and makeup mask at very reasonable price."
6,5.0,A market where you can find very good street food and nice shops.I like this place and enjoyed the street food
7,2.0,"We visited in the afternoon and there were lots and lots of stores that sell similar stuff. They sell clothes, shoes, souvenirs, kpop merchandise... the prices were more or less the same but some were cheaper. We did not spend much time there though since the place did not look appealing (it may have looked more alive at night) and it is easy to get lost.If you want to shop for souvenir, this could be a good place to go."
8,3.0,"The amount of shops were lesser and less touristy as compared to Myeongdong. There were, I think, more food stalls though."
9,1.0,"Nothing much to see or buy. Within 10 minutes, we left the place for good. Will recommend if you are interested for photo taking."
10,3.0,Very crowded market with lots of different shops selling the exact same stuff as all the other markets. They seem to have a high demand on phone cases in this country. We had very nice heotteok here.
11,2.0,"I didn’t particularly care for this market. Too much cheap stuff in jam packed spaces and hoards of people. People rummaging through clothes scattered across tables, cheap knock off handbags, tee-shirts, etc. I did enjoy delicious bibimbap at a small restaurant nestled just beyond the cinnamon donut street food vendor. A lovely owner who stirred my food for me and was so very kind. I preferred Myeongdong neat LOTTE and Dongdaemun neat JW Marriott and Doota."
12,5.0,"It seems as though every time I find myself in Seoul, I find myself at Namdaemun Market. I love this place especially if you know what to look for. They offer cheap prescription sunglasses to affordable brassware. The weekdays are the best time to go here as the weekends are crazy packed and it's difficult to even walk in the streets. If you haven't been, check it out!"
13,4.0,"We visited Namdaemun Market right as the sun went down, so I'm not sure if some of the stores were getting ready to close for the night, but we still found some awesome deals. My friend bought a cute winter jacket for $5!!! We bought some toddler hanboks for W35000, which is pretty reasonable."
14,5.0,"You're looking for souvenirs, local items made in Korea, Namdaemun market is the place. I bought some of their local snacks like dried fruits and vegetables, sweet potato chips, and many other kinds of flavour. We got free bag of mix veggies and fruits chips for each item I bought, great deal. Namdaemun is one station away from Myeongdong."
15,5.0,"This place full of cheap stuff, such as souvenirs, clothes, etc. And sometimes, the seller will give you some bonus. There's a lot of street food too."
16,5.0,We stayed 9 days in Seoul next to the Seoul station..we asked to the hostel reception for the best price exchange..He said Namdaemun and Myeongdong back streets have better rate from banks.. That was right especially in the midpoint there were two places that have very good rate. After Seoul we went to Pusan and Jeju.. we couldn't find good rate..if you start from Korea journey from Seoul..I advice you can make all exchange in Namdaemun market.. and in that time you can eat very delicious Korean local food on the street..
17,3.0,"This market is positively rated in most guide books. From my point of view it’s a bit overrated. It’s almost the same in such markets in Asia-colourful, noisy, overcrowded."
18,5.0,"What a fun outdoor market.  You can find anything in the market and it’s a lot of fun looking and haggling. It is easy access via subway, lots of great places to eat, and lots of cheap stuff to see and buy."

21,4.0,This area is huge and basically you can find everything there. I did not buy anything so I am not aware of prices. Area have also many nice camera  shops.
22,3.0,"This is the place to find cheap souvenirs. We had a good tour around the market, we spent some time here browsing for nice souvenirs. They sell so much stuffs here. Clothing/ accessories/ footwear/ snacks/ food. We did not try any of the food there, though some of them had Halal signs. Some sellers speak Bahasa Malaysia. Just a few Malay words. Interesting! We went there just to find souvenirs. There are other places you all should check out if you want to buy fashionable clothes, shoes, cosmetic products."
23,4.0,"Whole sale market. Touristy but very traditional place at the same time.There would be everything you need.You can also get some cool stuff for souvenir.Calguksu street represent this place. Calguksu bibimbob nangmeonw combo is signiture meue of this place.It costs only 6,000 or 7,000 won."
24,5.0,I am totally amazed by the changes through the years at Namdaemun..In fact Namdaemun is never my top option to visit. But I have changed my mind since after experiencing the changes which took place. Neater and easier to walk around with less grouchy vendors. More signs for tourists to locate different zones and with helpful guides in uniform around who speak several languages to assist with maps given.Various yummy authentic food available at reasonable prices such as Hairtail Alley which is a must try.Lovely easy connection to Seoullo7017 the pedestrians walkway from Namdaemun after all the feasting..easy going walk.
25,4.0,"Lively market. We arrived around 7pm so most clothing shops were already closed. However at the street level all the little food stalls were bursting with life so we tried some of the food, some of which were rather interesting! We felt safe eating these ‘street food’ because they fried/warmed them up on the spot. The shopkeepers were friendly too. A great experience."
26,5.0,This is the best place to go for souvenirs and street food because it is much cheaper and less crowded than Myeongdong or other famous shopping places in Seoul.
27,5.0,"I knew I wanted to spend the day at one of the famous markets, they are so fun, loud, interesting, and you get a true sense of the culture from meeting the street vendors and trying all the exotic dishes. This market in particular I was told is the biggest one in all of Seoul, my friends and I spent nearly five hours there and feel like I barely covered a small section."
28,4.0,"I went in the morning when the shops and stalls were just opening, and it wasn't too busy. I'd recommend in the late afternoon and at night when its crowded and hustle bustle. It would add to the atmosphere and excitement of the huge market.The market seemed to be orderly, with womens clothing grouped together, electronics all in one area, children's items in one area, etc. So there is some order to the market! I recommend just wandering down the allies and exploring without a plan. Please keep in mind there is no English to be found, so bring your guide map! There were 2 young girls wearing red information vests who spoke wonderful English to your destination and provide you maps.Definitely go to this market! There's a great feeling here and you can pick up anything and everything you could possibly think of and need."
29,4.0,"Are you hungry? There's a variety of things to eat! Do you prefer to shop? Don't worry, Namdaemun's got you covered!Do you just want to see new and exciting things? Well, what are you waiting for - go to Namdaemun!Even if you don't want to spend money, I would highly recommend still going to experience the atmosphere of a traditional market. There are people everywhere, shop owners are shouting about the items they are selling to those who might be interested, and deliverymen are swerving in and out of the crowds.Also, side note - please go eat the Hotteok here! IT IS DIVINE AND AMAZING! Especially when the weather is cold!"
30,5.0,"There are many kinds of  food . There is a shop selling  hot steaming buns ! Their original ones taste fantastic, prefer the  original to kimchi one!  First time trying  out the pig's leg there.... not  bad but tasted better ones. A place to buy bath cloth !"
31,5.0,"It's a nice local market, perfect for shopping souvenirs to take home :) Try the dumplings and the ginger tea, those are so good!"
32,5.0,"There is this old lady (ajumma) who sells almonds and all the real o brownie cheaper than anyone else in seoul. I compared prices across lotte, gs25, 7-11 and all the other stores but hers were the cheapest and has the same expiry date as others.She was very kind and she offered us to try the almonds of various flavours for free.I took a photo of her stall which I will share once I find it. Her shop is very small and narrow along the main street down Namdaemun market."
33,5.0,"If you're a fan of spicy braised fish soup or galchi jorim, this is the place for you! Hairtail Alley (found in Nandaemun Market) has clusters of small eateries selling this specialty---hairtail! I first learned of this this place from a YouTuber, and he made it look so good, I knew I had to try the dish when I visited. I'm so glad I did. The soup was to die for. I'm now a fan and trying to recreate a version of the dish at home."
34,4.0,Decent market. Not unlike it's sister markets around the world. Good selection of stuff. Best if visited to observe / experience local culture. Good 2-3 hour trip.
35,5.0,"Asian market place in downtown Seoul.  Hustle, bustle, sights, sounds, and smells.  Certainly worth the visit."
36,3.0,"well, you wouldn’t mind the crowd; Endless markets to shop; Endless road to roam; Endless line to grab a bite of « the » glassnoodle pancake(hotteok). Namdaemoon markets to have a sneak peak at KoreA👗👒"
37,5.0,"I really like this place. People are so friendly and there are many street shops where you can buy souvenirs and eat. There is a mandu place inside the market that is really good and really cheap. You have to go there. They give you 5 Mandu for 3000 won and you will have side 단무지 for free and water. There are many tourists so, sometimes make sure to ask for a discount in some stores."
38,3.0,"The place is near Courtyard by Marriott Hotel, you could visit it by walking 🚶 .... We had the chance to visit the market and bought some souvenir items on a cheaper price..."
39,5.0,This market is a must for visitors - to see the various goods there are for sale ... from clothes to food .. but one must try to bargain for a good buy..
40,5.0,"A wholesale place to get your clothing, accessories and gifts. The shops inside the building or upper floor offer cheaper price. The dumpling in this market is the best. Really love the kimchi dumpling and pork dumpling. If you are there, you should try it !!!"
41,5.0,This market is quite interesting. Lots to shop and so much to see. It is a whole day activity. I suggest you take the metro to get to this market as it leads you straight to the beginning of the market.
42,5.0,Went early morning to check the market.Bought some korean spoon set.Tried their breads and gimbap for breakfast.
43,5.0,Variety of localy priduced clothes and goods. From tshirt to tops to leather jackets to hats they have it all. And the street food stalls spread around exit 5 to fill your tummy if you are hungry or treat your taste buds
44,4.0,"Nice place to see all fresh Korean food. Plenty of vendors convince you to get some food. During winter they'd provide heater under the long chair which it was nicely warm.They are selling dumpling with the soup (Mandu), blood pudding (sundae), raw octopus, chilli pickled cabbage (kimchi), hot&spicy rice cake (toppokki), Korean sushi roll (gimbap), etc.Very convenient to reach as it located in the centre."
45,5.0,"Great place to wander, try foods (yes, the place seems a bit sketchy, but feel free to eat! You’ll be fine and may have your best meal!), pick up souvenirs, and enjoy!"
46,5.0,"Loved the fish stew alley...we ended up coming here about 4-5 times.  Awesome spicy fish stew for about 8,000 krw and also getting the local experience where many Koreans come.  Once you find the food district, they have alleyways all dedicated to the same type of food...the hairtail fish stew was one made of chili, radish and the fish and that was all they carried.  So if you are in a group and some cannot handle it, this is not the place to go.Aside from the food, this is a market which sells cheap goods...not a whole lot of bargaining here and the goods can be quite expensive for fake products so beware."
47,3.0,"It is a market were you can find multiple things  ( hand bags, stationary, jewel, clothing, too, umbrellas and more). It is a huge complex and besides what you see in the street there are doors with an inside commerce."
48,5.0,Good place for budget travellers. Many items are relatively cheap. But Bangkok and KL are way much better and cheaper
49,4.0,"This market is very big with lots of entrance leading to different sections. It is an open air market with buildings on the side which, each building specialized in different products. There are sections and building specialized in infant to children's clothes, shoes and accessories, men's items, jewelries, mattresses, ladies shoes, clothes etc. There is even a section where you can find alteration services. Things a relatively cheap and even cheaper if buy in bulk as they sell stuff in wholesale prices. Do drop by this market if you are in the vicinity and their shops open early too."
50,5.0,I am so amazed in this very clean market. I enjoyed variety of goods being sold. If you are a foreigner in this country and love to cook this is the best place to buy the ingredients. I think the prices are reasonable enough. You just have to go around first to know who sell with least price.
51,5.0,This market seems to be a lower market compared to the Myeongdong Market just a block down the road. I thought that there was a bit more food options here and it was cheaper. Walked past a Hotteok stand and had to get one cause it just smelt so nice. There were plenty of shops and stalls lining the road which seemed to be cheaper too. Plenty of entrances around so shouldn't be too difficult to find.Seems more like a local market than a tourist one which is why I thought it was a nice change.
52,5.0,"Namdaemun Market is the largest traditional market in South Korea with selling a variety of goods from clothes to accessories, ginseng and spectacles etc… The market is adjacent to Myeongdong and takes about 10-15 minutes by foot to get there. Although Namdaemun Market might not be that far away, the chilly autumn breeze certainly made it a walk to remember.It can be considered as a wholesale market so items sold here are usually priced reasonably and you save the more you buy. Of course, you may also try your hand at bargaining. We were there to get some ginseng (there's a ginseng street). Definitely a place worth visiting! For more on the experience and photos, please check out my blog. ^^"
53,5.0,"I tried a lot of tokbokki but I really liked the tokbokki here in Namdaemun market. Stores sells a lot of ginseng products, nuts, dried fruits,  underwear clothings, shoes, and accessories. This is the best time to be in Seoul, spring season. Not too cold and not too hot to go walking outside and enjoy this vibrant city. Can't wait to be back here again."
54,4.0,A market that offers variety items at fair  price. Bought souvenir items and a hanbok. Enjoyed the tteokbokki at one of the food stalls. Pleasant & very helpful sellers. You can haggle 😊A must visit if your looking for  variety & bargain!
55,5.0,The market has many whole sale stores. It’s a busy area and you can buy nice things in a good price but you’ll have to bargin. I’d recommend an hour or two to walk around and get a glimpse of whats going on
56,2.0,"Instagram @oppakulinerThis is a typical flea market, there are many stores here but it's more expensive than the other flea market I've visited in Seoul. It's too crowded also and not find anything good and worth to buy here. For me is no"

63,3.0,"Advice to come here during the day time , for street food , snacks , souvenirs , which was cheaper ."
64,5.0,"There's plenty of places to eat for a very affordable price and you can tell the authenticity of the food because the ""auntie's"" are manning the stalls. Needless to say, the food was so scrumptious, specially the bulgogi. People are friendly despite not being able to speak English well."
65,4.0,Namdaemun Market is a great market to wander and experience and see what a traditional street market is like. This market is very organized and there are helpers/tourist info guides to help you navigate the market. There is also an information booth in the middle of the market that has free maps of the market and area and it is a great place to stop and get yourself orientated. The market is divided up in sections and the map has landmarks and the sections listed. The food in the market is very good and cheap and it is advisable to go there on an empty stomach. You will find cheap souvenirs here as well.

69,2.0,It's an elderly market as you can see by the time you reach the market. Alot of elder shopping there and the sellers are mostly elders too so dun expect fashionable clothing for youngsters. I heard it has good choices of food but I didn't find any. But It sells cheaper korean souveniers comparing to other touristy spots.
70,4.0,"This is a nice market to visit, from live fish to home appliances and everything in between...not exactly cheap"
71,4.0,"Namdaemun Market is quite central. You can find food, clothes, make-up, glasses (lots of glasses), karaoke bars and anything you could think of. It is veeeeeery crowded and loud, mostly young people. There is one place where young musicians and bands sing and make music for everyone. This was very nice to see and listen. Definitely recommended"
72,5.0,"Diverse wares and food stalls in the heat of Korea. Some of the most traditional and interesting dishes I’ve encountered in Korea.  San-nakji (산낙지) is a variety of hoe (raw dish) made with long arm octopus. Although the octopuses are killed before being cut into small pieces and served, the nerve activity in the octopus' tentacles still makes the pieces move posthumously on the plate whilst served."
73,5.0,"Our visit to Korea was great but I found the culinary experience to be lacking. Food was pricey but underwhelming in every restaurant we visited. Maybe we just went to the wrong places to eat. We ventured to explore Namdaemun market in front of our hotel in the last few days of our trip. We were not disappointed! It was a tourist haven. Food was cheap, authentic and delicious. So much variety. I loved the huge dumplings! It was the best! Bang for every buck! You can also shop for cheap stuff in the market. There were a lot of winter clothes on sale, street food and a lot of souvenirs. My best buy was the Rimowa looking luggage set (Small, Medium and Large) for only P 9,000 or about USD 180.Be sure to visit Namdaemun Market when in Korea."

75,5.0,"Few of the shops were closed on the week at evening (after 6pm) but there were still plenty of delicious street food. I should have bought more sweet rice cakes from the old man, they were so delicious! Remember to visit the Kalguksu alley! The ajummas cooking are loud when trying to get you to sit down at their table, but so sweet and kind when serving. Should have visited Namdaemun market once more, will do it next time in Seoul!"
76,4.0,"If you are seriously looking for accessories shopping. This is a great place!  So much to choose from... you have to know what you are looking for and send me idea of pricing as you can truly find awesome deals. I can spend all day here... but no as I will go broke😎 if you have few hours, I highly recommend for shopping and gifts. Friendly people and many speaks English and good food."
77,4.0,"This is biggest day and night market in Seoul. It opens early and closed late at night time. You can find almost anything you need here. It does gets really busy. There are things that are expensive, but when it comes to eating. It is really cheap and good. It is located near the train station. If you see a building called ""Common Plaza"" you are basically there. The vendors sels everything in bulk. If you see this place called Hyojason King Dumplings. They make fresh food on the spots everyday!! Also, walk pass Hyojason King Dumplings, you should see it on the right hand side a restaurant called ""Namdeamun Charcoal bbq"". Must stop here for their food. It is really good and cheap!"
78,4.0,"This is quite a huge market with a lot of small lanes. It could be intimidating for first timer to be honest but enjoyable nonetheless. There's also Muslim friendly food at this market located in the small alley where they sell galchi jorim, grilled fish and serve the best fried fish (imo) as banchan. It could be hard to find at first but once you know the way it would be a breeze just make sure you have a map with you if you're unfamiliar with the place."
79,4.0,"This is the most largest market for all sorts of traders. You name it they have it. They even have a Tourist Assistance to assist any tourist about this place.

I stumbled across a firing range in the market which was really cool! Loads of food to choose from of all varieties though mainly traditional Korean. Absolutely worth a wander!"
84,4.0,"Visited the market both in the morning as well at night. The place was fairly relaxed before 9am on a Sunday morning. It was crowded from noon to about 730pm. Some parts of the place would be deserted by 9pm.The galchi jorim fish alley was busy even till 3pm on a Saturday. Had late lunch at Uri Sikdang, one of the shops there and the food was good. USD8 for the meal there and the tofu stew was very good.Plenty of street food at one of the stretch and you could get fishcake skewers, chicken skewers, octopus etc. I'd usually return the stick to the stall since there is no dustbin around.For shopping, recommend to start earlier in the morning as the crowd starts just before noon time.Plenty of coffee places in the market but most are closed on Chuseok. Most of the coffee places are for take-out."

89,3.0,"Don't buy your clothes here, much more expensive than the ones you can find at especially ehwa uni and at dongdaemun. Best place to buy souvenirs like the spoons, keychain, t-shirts. Surprised at how some of the Korean shopkeepers can.speak.Malay"

92,4.0,There are so many things to see and eat in the market. Can spend whole day around. The tourist community lounge is a must visit to try traditional Korean hanbok for free photo session. Staff are so nice and even tidy hair for better look. All tourist information staff are so good and know the market so well for what you after. Food or varieties of goods. It just could be hot in summer days as mostly outdoor and wet if rains.
93,5.0,Huge market where you can bargain.  Hoehyeon subway station 425 on the number 4 blue line.  Many street food carts to enjoy.  One drawback is the huge crowds.

95,4.0,"This market offers the whole array of korean culture, save the gorgeous landscapes outside Seoul. People are so kind and many speak english.There is a a narrow alley way of very typical korean cuisine that gives you a perfect example of their typical foods and overpopulation in a small land problem. An experiance one from a spacey country never forgets!  (Its close to the chiken man, or otherwordly, flashy chicken restaurant)."
96,3.0,"This is a fun place to visit, but only to visit. There is nothing really of offer here except cheap knock offs and bad quality clothing. Rude shoppers ( yet it seem Koreans are just rude period ) still fun to walk through"

Also, check out the free hanbok rental place nearby at the customer info centre - super fun to play dress up with all the hanboks available."
100,4.0,"This market offers various types of souvenirs, such as key chains, fridge magnets, wallet, and many others. The price of the souvenirs are cheaper compared to other places. I will always come to this market whenever I visit Korea for sure."
101,5.0,The place was just about 5 minutes walk from our hotel so  we went around 9-10pm. Limited stores are open and street foods were same price with Myeongdong. We came back during weekend around noon and wow this place is amazing! Cheapest souvenirs and local food. They also have restaurants that served delicious food. A must-visit place in Seoul
102,5.0,street food here is a lot cheaper (500 won for odeng compared to 2000 won at myeongdong!) and great place to get accessories at the wholesale building! good place to walk around!
103,5.0,"Street food....indoor and outdoor street vendor selling children clothing, knockoff purse, household items, candy, stationary etc.........Haired fish alley - local favorite fish soup and grilled fish. They only have a few items on the menu. You can see everyone order the same dishes, haired fish a.k.a. Beltfish stew and assorted grill fish.Noodle alley - not an actual alley. Just a long store with a few vendor. Cold noodle and hand cut noodle are must try.We went back twice for the food. Shopping was a bit complicated for us. Indoor area was a maze with tight aisle so we gave up. Not much we needed in the outdoor area. Don't be surprised you see men in some of the bathroom, they are co-ed lol....If you are lost, they have an Information booth in the middle of the market with English, Japanese,  and Chinese translator. Very handy!"
104,4.0,Extremely busy place and very popular with locals searching for a variety of food for anytime of the day. Definitely worth the visit but be prepared for the large crowds.
105,4.0,"This open air market is very big and have varieties of things to sell specially clothing and toys! Each store have their own opening and closing hours depends on the amount of customers they get, I  think!? Lol not sure! But we were there on a rainy day and most of the stores were closed by 3pm but still it was definitely a place to check out!"
106,4.0,"This place has everything you need from souvenirs to household goods, bags, clothing, accessories and plenty of food to keep your stomach full. Prices are reasonable compared to the underground shopping but you can get better prices by going inside to the shopping malls. I find the outside stalls prey on the tourists by saying no discount or has a higher mark up but the shops inside the malls are cheaper.Save your shopping for this market! The locals shop here as well!"
107,4.0,"If you walk into the market through gate 2 and walk almost all the way through, just before you get to the subway entrance #5 (which will be on your left) this dumpling shop will be on your right. There will likely be a ""to go"" line out front. Main floor is making the dumplings- push by and go upstairs, second floor is seating at tables but if it is full third floor is sitting on cushions on the floor. Get a spot where you can. We had traditional and kimchi dumplings. Just point to what someone else is having and hold up fingers for how many you want. They were delish!"
108,5.0,"Want to experience the Korean shopping culture, then Namdaemun is a popular place to go. Prices are reasonable, the food is great and plentiful, and you can find most everything there. There is alleyway upon alleyway of shops and local vendors. Bartering is a must; however, some vendors are set with their prices so don't expect to get a ""third-world"" price. Koreans are friendly and they mostly speak English in the market. Don't try to insult them thinking you can get ""yard sale"" price for their goods. Remember, Korea has the world's 11th ranked GDP."
109,5.0,"Loved this market. Clean and well organized. You can find all you need in one place to experience Korea. Best of all, its also one of the cheapest places to eat great food, souvenirs and winter clothes. Some shops are open 24 hours. I regret not being able to explore the entire market. Never leave without trying their pork and shrimp buns and dimsum! Super good!!!"
110,3.0,"Was shopping around Namdaemun Market, we actually found some jewellery wholesale market in Namdaemun."
111,4.0,"It was Chinese Lunar Year holiday when my friends an I went to there. Some store closed, but luckily some still opened. Mostly there were souvenirs store and street food vendors. I bought a yacheottok (Sorry, If I'm mispelling), korean snack with vegetable filling. There were a long queue when I bought it. If you want to get here you can stop at Hohyeon line 4 exit 3/5"
112,4.0,"I went there couple times to buy souvenir such as seaweed, biscuits etc. Price are not very cheap, compare to the big supermarkets e.g EMart, homeplus etc. But it is a local place to see many local people, different with the kpop stars. Can also try the local food. Well, if u have more time, can visit Namdaemun market, walking distance from Myeong Dong"
113,5.0,"This is a very big market. It is the largest traditional market with various goods in store. To go here, take subway to Hoehyeon Station (Line 4) Exit #5. By the way if you are feeling hungry, there’s a Halal food chain selling Kebab."
114,4.0,"This place is best place for shopping anything you want like souvenir,t-shirts,brooch, bracelets,earrings and others. For Muslims, there is halal kebab when you walk straight from exit 5 Line 4 Hoehyeon station. It will be on your right before heading to Namdaemun. 😊"
115,5.0,Great place to browse. Locals shop here. Non of the touristy knick knacks Not big. Enough to spend 60-70 minutes to browse. Maybe buy a bit.
116,4.0,Some items can be cheaper to get here. Think there are more tourists than local buyers..so not everything is cheaper unlesd you buy in bulk
117,3.0,"This is the place you can get the cheapest if not cheaper as compared to other places, ranging from food to garments to household."
118,4.0,We loved the street food here - so much better than Myeongdong's! It's a tourist spot but it's also a local hangout. Atmosphere was lively and love the numerous coffe bars.
119,4.0,"Namdaemun or the South Gate, is dynamic market - a place where you will experience the sight and sense of the true Korean culture -  kimchi, seaweeds, fresh fish, ginseng,etc... and yet also find buildings upon buildings or clothes, accessories, household goods, Korean Arts and Crafts, umbrellas, shoes, children's clothes, and many more - food stalls, small restaurants, coffee shops. If it's your first time, make sure to find the ""Tourist"" booth- they will give you a map and answer all kinds of questions for you."
120,5.0,"We visited this market in late October the weather had turned cold but the vibe was still great. Lots of local Street foods and lots of stalls with a variety of products from bags, clothes, socks,  fur to he's and so much more. A must visit whilst in Seoul.  It's a pleasant 10-15 minute walk from Seoul station."
121,5.0,"Very popular market with streets as well as underground malls selling a wide range of goods from food to kitchenware to accessories and clothing (mainly female orientated). There are tourist information points where you can ask questions and also get a map of the area which will be helpful for identifying which streets to target.For those that like to shop and haggle there is plenty here if the styles suit why you're looking for. Personally, it's the food here that gets me excited.There is a small street specially serving knife cut noodles which gets rammed with hungry people sitting at the noodle bars getting their fill. There are back and side streets selling a variety of foods from dumplings to noodles and rice all very decently priced.There are street stalls selling a variety of snacks from pork knuckle to fish cakes to rice cakes and deep fried croquettes. Just go round and don't be scared to try something new!"
122,4.0,"We went there to buy souvenirs. The place is huge! Before u go, to save a lot of time, you need to really know which place/shop u want to go. Don't buy souvenirs from the shops by the roadside coz it's expensive. Go inside the building, a lt of shop selling souvenirs and it's half the price from the people selling outside the building."
123,5.0,"You can almost get all you need to buy from the street, ranging from seaweed, kimchi to hanbok, cosmetics. It is a market where locals love to shop at, the things were all reasonably priced and has lots of varieties. There are also ahjumas around to change money if you run out of it."
124,5.0,This place is to visit between 7am to 5pm. The first time we visit around 4pm .some shops are already closing so they do not entertain us. There are lots of jewellery shops inside the buildings. However they are wholesales shops. Some shops owners allow you to buy. While some does not entertain you if you do not have a shop yourself. There are many shops outside which sell pots/kitchen items/shoes for  mothers / clothes for dad . There are some shops which the buns are nice
125,2.0,"No doubt this is a very popular market but if you don't have many days in Seoul, I would recommend going to Myeongdong and Dondaemun market instead. Streets here are very narrow, crowded and easy to loose your  way. We were glad to get out of there before the festival started in the evenings. However if you are there, the the great dumpling eatery at the corner of gate 4."
126,3.0,"If you are into bargain shopping, then Namdaemun Market is for you. They have lots of bags, luggages and trinkets for souvenirs. If you love cameras, they have long lines of stores dedicated to all hobbyist and professionals. Their cameras are located near the Sungnnyemun Gate. Camera accessories and parts are a lot cheaper."
127,3.0,"This is very different from myeongdong shopping which is modern and high end. This place has roadside stores set up by locals and sometimes elderly selling things like socks, sweater, shoes and ginseng. The streets are crowded although not unmanageable. There's tourist information booths called tourist lounge that are happy to give you a map of the place. I would suggest you come in from the western end of the market and make your way through the eastern end. You would reach one of the old city gates."
128,4.0,"The time to spend your money if you haven't spend on anything in Seoul. You can choose from souvenirs, clothes, bags, accessories, food, and many more here. This is also the time to use your haggling skill if you never done it before, although not all shops will accept it. Have fun exploring the streets."
129,4.0,"Visited Namdaemun market before we headed home. It was not that crowded in the evening. Lots of stalls selling clothes, bags, shoes and souvenirs. There were food stalls too. The children's clothes were very trendy with reasonable prices. You can bargain here. Some shop keepers are very friendly towards tourists."
130,3.0,"It depends on what you're looking for. I been living here for 10 months, last Saturday for my first time here and i was disappointed. For a tourist it may look amazing at first sight because is very crowded and there is a lot of stuff to buy. Everything is crazy expensive (they treat you like an ignorant tourist i guess). Mainly shopping like bags shoes and jackets, there aren't food places besides some cheap street food. Good location in Seoul but this isn't a Top-10 place to visit in Seoul like some tourists guides say."
131,4.0,"Nice place to shop!!! Very friendly local people around, reasonable price to buy.... all thing we can get here, from souvenirs, clothing etc.."
132,4.0,"We went just after the Chuseok festival, so a lot of stalls were still closed. But it was still very pleasant with all the stalls. The focus of this market is more on cheap clothes, bags, etc rather than cosmetics. There are also several stalls selling local delicacies."
133,3.0,"If you stay near myeongdong area it's not a bad idea to take morning stroll to namdaemun market (don't go when raining cos most stores will likely closed).The market has cosmetic shops like nature republic, street foods for breakfast, push carts selling clothes, bags, socks etc of cheaper price than retail shops. We brought a cardigan for KRW 4,000; fruits such as 1 loft of grapes & 3 persimmon and 4 peaches for KRW 13,000. About 11am we cross over the street to Shinshigae to buy bakery at basement - tai pao(sponge cake) and some freshly baked buns to take back home."
134,3.0,"The market does have a couple of authentic Korean food places and lots of shoes, if you wear Korean sizes..I usually like markets but it seemed a bit repetitive and could have done without seeing it."
135,5.0,"This is a traditional market area where locals would come to purchase all the items they need for like.  As places like the mall and Costco become more common with the local culture this area is dying away.  Don't get me wrong its still a bustling area packed with locals, but its a great view into the history.  Lots of places to eat and drink, but the real reason is to see local life."
136,4.0,Nice to walk around specially on weekends and may find lots of special items that could be bought.Little lower in price than other places around seoul The local food smell is to me unbearable and off course not halal.
137,5.0,I could see a lof of locals here you know a lot literally!!! And street food there look interesting pork feet fish cakes korean big dumplings which made me so hungry and they were pretty good. My favorite was Korean donut that was deep fried and topped with sugarTry when you get there
138,4.0,"The whole market is so big with plenty of shops. As I was running out of time, I managed to be here only for one hour which is not enough to look for the cheaper price souvenir etc. Basically, there are so many things being sold here; clothes, souvenirs, beauty products (recommended to buy at Myeongdong), foods, cutlery..etc. I went to Namdaemun from Myeongdong street which is around 10 mins walking. Compared to Insadong, the price of souvenirs here are much cheaper (500 - 2000 won cheaper based on my survey) and the choices are much variety here. However, in term of crowd, Namdaemun has more crowds from foreign tourists and locals.I bought I LOVE KOREA t-shirts 3 pcs for 10000 won, fridge magnets for 1000 won and a set of spoon & chopsticks for 3000 won.For muslim travellers looking for halal korean sweets as souvenirs, there is an ahjumma here selling Kkultarae. She is very friendly and can speaks Malay a little bit as well as Japanese. So, if you are looking for cheaper souvenirs and don't really mind being in crowded place, you can spend a longer time in Namdaemun."
139,5.0,There is no comparison to the size and assortment of this open market! It is a flea market on steroids! Haggling is acceptable which makes it fun to people watch.There are food vendors with local treats as well as fruits and smoothies to cool the weary shoppers. It's always good to see the locals shopping here also. Makes it more legit.
140,4.0,"Namdaemun is a market place that has everything from dried squid to fancy winter jackets. It can be crowded, as it has become really popular among locals and tourists. There are vendors on the streets and vendors in the different buildings. In each floor of each building, you'll find a lot of surprises. There's a floor that's mainly for women's accessories; a floor mainly for pots and pans, a floor for Korean souvenirs, a floor for fresh flowers. Go to another building, and you'll find stalls upon stalls of children's clothing, women's clothing, men's clothing and many more. You will not be bored!!"
141,3.0,"This market is in interesting place to walk around and look at a plethora of items including Korean souvenirs, soccer jerseys, clothes, luggage, fruits, vegetables, eye glasses, hiking gear, and the list goes on.  You will NOT find funiture or the kitchen sink. Don't hesitate to try the fresh fruit and juices.  They are a nice treat after walking around that much.  On a very hot day, there is not a lot of air moving in this location so go early in the day or pick a nice fall day to go.  Prices are about the same between vendors but the more you buy, the more they bargain.Where comfortable shoes!"
142,3.0,"The famed Bibimbap Alley brought me to this market, and I was not disappointed by that.  Incredible food prepared by such lovely ladies, felt well taken care of.The market itself had a sad vibe to it, almost entirely filled with cheap Chinese knockoffs/random items.  If you had a specific thing in mind it would be okay, but as a casual tourist it was an unsettling experience."
143,5.0,"On my first trip to Korea I skipped this place since I thought it'll be the same as other places such as Myeongdong, Hongdae, Erwha, Gangnam, ect.  This place is where you will find the best deals for souvenirs, gifts, clothing and cute socks.  As others pointed out that they all sell the same stuff but this is where you start your bargaining game.  While some sellers will not budge in their prices, most will do it if you buy in more quantities.  For example in Myeongdong, most of their socks will sell for 1000kw a pair.  In Namdaemun you will find many shops selling like 10,000kw for 15-18pairs of socks, so it all comes down to how many you will buy.  Just make sure the things you buy were made in Korea and not China. ;)Oh and the street food was great and much cheaper then myeongdong.  This place open mornings to 6pm so don't come any later or you will find majority of the shops closing down."
144,3.0,"Huge market with many vendors.  The only problem is that they are selling mostly the same stuff.  For some reason socks were being sold everywhere!! I bought one gift item and was able to make a small negotiation.  There is food available from vendors, but make sure you watch them cook it for freshness."
145,4.0,"We stumbled across the Jewelry Mart in one of buildings facing the main street of the Namdaemun Market. There are endless stalls carrying a huge array of fashion jewelry - earrings, rings, necklaces, pins, etc. Many of the shops are wholesale only so you need to purchase 5-10 pieces of the same style. We did find a few shops near the entrance that will sell single pieces to us at a good price. We bought many bracelets and rings @ KRW 2,000 - 6,000 ea. The quality of the pieces is very good!!"
146,5.0,"Don't visit Seoul without visiting Namdaemum markets. There are so many different stalls, not just on ground level, but they go underground too. You'll get lost wandering around, just remember the gate number you came in on and have fun wandering up and down the many passage ways. I'm sure anything you want, you can by it at these markets."
147,3.0,"Happened to go in the evening so it was quieter and not so crowded. The vegetable and fish sellers had packed up and gone. What's left are vendors selling cheap knick knacks like souvenirs, apparel, toys and ginseng. There were cooked food vendors but not as many as Myeongdong area. Go only if you are within the vicinity and go earlier to catch more interesting sights."
148,5.0,"I did most of my shopping for souvenirs to bring back home at this market. They have shoes, umbrellas clothes, trinkets and some amazing street food."
149,5.0,"This is what I envisioned when I think of an Asian street market. Tons of street stalls in addition to stalls inside multilevel buildings selling just about everything. There's a section that sells blankets, a section that sells shoes, a section that sells cookware ...... The best one is the section that sells decorative papers, the kind that comes in sheets for wrapping presents or folding origami. They also had fancy gift bags, containers, party favors .... Good place to shop if you're planning a wedding. Be prepared for crowd and noise. Worth a walk through."
150,5.0,"Just for the atmosphere or for the shopping... Don't miss it. It a lovely, colorful, diverse market. You can hang around for a few hours between the accessories, glasses, cloth and restaurants ."
151,5.0,"One of the best shopping area in Seoul should never miss this areaA lot of shop for clothes, shoes, accessories, kids ware, bugs more and more"
152,5.0,"As you leave the subway station, you will find shops for cosmetics, clothes, wigs, souvenirs, etc etc.  At great prices.  Possible to haggle down a bit, probably 10-20%.  Or you could ask for extras for the products.  Not at all crowded on a Tuesday morning in April.   Great finds.  :)Try the street food as well.  Highly recommended"
153,5.0,This market is very chep. You can have some breakfast and lunch here. The coffee shop are also good to visiting and take a rest.
154,5.0,"Varieties of products sold here! Try to struck a good bargain with the seller and you could landed in shopping heaven. Great place to look for souvenirs and gifts, as usual local street food as well!"
155,5.0,The best place to shop! If you want to find sourvenir.. u may find that this market .. the price much more lower than myeongdong. Pls go to the mall/big shop instead of the market to get the best rate. 1. Nandaemun 2. Myeongdong
156,2.0,"Lot of old shops, some street stalls and tired looking complex. Some of the stuff put on display outside the shops look old.  A day time activity to sample the morning bazaar and market. Walking distance from Myeongdong, just behind Shinsigae Department Store.  We bumped into it whilst trying to find a restaurant."
157,4.0,"Fun place to have a look if you are visiting Seoul. My foreign friends loved here. Don't forget to eat Vegetable Pancake in this market. If you explore deep inside of this market, you might able to find some cheap random stuff."
158,5.0,A place to shop you can haggle bargains in this place. If you want to enjoy authentic Korean food this a a place to be. They have all kinds of ginseng store in this place
159,3.0,This underground market is place for lots of local products and reasonable priced goods...its very busy during the day...and it gives a good feel for the local culture of seoul
160,4.0,"Namdaemum market opens from 7am to 5pm for retail. Basically this is a place where you can find almost everything you need. Souvenirs, kimchi, clothing, silver ware , street foods etc. We were not aware it opens till 5pm during the first time we visited - blame us for not doing enough homework. We managed to get shop till will drop the next day. For those who needs to change currency, you may do so here too."
161,5.0,"As with lots of areas in Seoul, items for sale are grouped by topic. The market really shows itself if you venture inside the buildings and talk with the shop owners. Hours of hunting if you like markets."
162,4.0,Visited to go shopping souvenirs.Lots of fun items and exotic (not for me) foods selling on the street.It is also good to visit at night.
163,5.0,"This is Seoul at its best - great community shopping in little shops, kiosk, and arrayed on tarps right on the street!  The market is alive with activity and deals and will not disappoint.  I felt this was the most local market of those I visited and delighted in the hubbub and activity all crowded in together, yet it was an organized chaos and a delight to experience. Love the street food as well as the tiny little restaurants that advertise their food with actual displays. I could have stayed lost in there all day just enjoying the brisk dealings and the delightful Korean people. They are so gracious, and kind and have a sincere air of pride without being boastful or haughty."
164,4.0,"Namdaemun isn't a place for new fashion like Dongdaemun. Here is market feel shopping. Good place to buy souvenirs , Korean snacks , Korean tea and Ginseng . Streets here are complicated to recognize that need extra careful while visit with kids or old folks ."
165,5.0,"This was such fun to walk through for the colour & atmosphere. We stopped for lunch at a little locals' restaurant & though we didn't speak Korean & the staff didn't speak English, we were able to order some great food - loved it!"
166,4.0,"Namdaemun market is one of largest traditional market in Korea which sells various items/goods, for example clothes, hanbok (traditional korean clothes), glasses, toys, kitchenware, mountain gear, stationary, fine arts, accessories, unique korean gifts, hats, gingseng, food, cosmetics and etc. In namdaemun market, you can bargain for the best price, for tourists who can't speak korean, you can prepare calculator on your phone for negotiate the prices. It's too crowded there because many people in there came for shopping, or just wandering around."
167,4.0,"Too crowded!! Scary crowded on some streets. Asian and Muslim tourists flock here. Businesses Need more international signs. I can't tell what the food is. Food vendors have lines and are rude. Bring a snack and cash. I have found hats, scarves, T-shirts, costume jewelry and crafts here reasonable to cheap. Not stroller or wheelchair friendly. There are some camera shops around the corner, a huge 5 story Dream Depot Crafts, and an underground craft market. They also have cheap RX glasses. I recommend walking from Seoul station. There are signs . It takes you past the gorgeous gate and under the street. If you go at Christmas, DD has christmas junk."
168,4.0,"Could find everythgs in the market, u name it u get it basically. A very busy area with countless shopsss and the shoppers. Went there two times, 1st time was around 930am,  only partially shopss were open. 2nd round went at around 1030, almost all were open."
169,4.0,"Good if you want to buy souvenirs for the price is cheapest here as compared to the other places we have visited (Myeoungdong, Gangnam, Sinchon, Nami Island, Everland, Subways to name a few). I also bought a very good quality bubble coat here from an old lady selling it in one of the stalls on the streets. However, there are some shops here that will not want you to browse their goods if they saw you are a foreigner that does not speak Korean. Tip: Try to haggle or ask for freebies especially if you bought a lot of items."
170,3.0,"There are good buys in this area but it is hidden so well among the vast amount of shops that one might find it too hard to shop as you will be spoilt for variety! Some of the shops are for wholesaler and esp if you don't speak Korean (like me), you probably might not know where to start. It is interesting to get lost in the alleys and streets and find that you seem to be waking in circles. Each building along the street offer at least 5 storeys of shopping stalls (I don't use shops as there is no clear shop front between each seller. More like counters in department store concept)So be ready to get lost in here! Depending on where you end up, it can be a 10-15min walk to reach Myeongdong for more shopping! If you can find a shop owner who speaks your language, they can easily point you to the right direction."
171,4.0,"Maybe January is not the best time of year with minus 15 degree temperature in an open market. The stalls are numerous to say the least- row after row and street after street of stalls. As usual there is tremendous duplication but overall a shoppers paradise. The vendors seem helpful and happily are not aggressive as in some other countries. Crowds were less than expected maybe due to the weather. Overall a happy experience. By the way, lots and lots of food."
172,4.0,"Accessibility - very goodPrices - variesSafeness - goodIf you wish to have a taste of Seoul's marketplace, this is a good place to go. You can also try their street food! ;)"
173,2.0,Namdaemun Market can be reached by subway and is very near to Myeong-dong by walking. Visited the area based on feedback. Don't really like the place compared to Dongdaemun. I will give a miss if I am visiting Korea again.
174,4.0,"I've been here many times. sometimes for shopping but mostly as a tour guide. Many of the items are not as cheap as in years past, but you can still haggle (make sure you do it alone). And you can find just about anything your looking for: clothes accessories, souvenir items, hand bags, and so on."
175,3.0,Most every major tourist destination in Asia has crazy shopping and crazier night markets. Namdaemun is where you come to get the same goods (junk) but at half the price. The area isn't the prettiest. The shop owners aren't the quietest. And the smells. Well it's Korea... And it's all part of the experience. The crowds. The noise. The craziness is what makes this place unique. From fake bags to a whole floors dedicated to flowers. You can find it here. Come visit and see for yourself.
176,5.0,This is a great way to experience the local shopping scene! If you're a bargin shopper you MUST visit the Namdaemun Market! Endless vendors & street food for those who are adventurous!
177,4.0,"It was my first time visited this market. I heard about it many times but never been there. But, after visited there I love it as there are many stores and the things there are cheaper. But, you have to bargain and be there early so that you can get the best offer. We also tried two of the restaurants which served big portion of food. If you are Malaysian, share your food for 2."
178,4.0,"This area sells items that may appeal to an older generation.  However, I like that it is quieter than Myeongdong and has some delicious food stalls (for ₩5,000 to ₩10,000 sells 3 course lunch meals).  Space is tight at the food stalls and once you sit, you eat then go as there is usually a line of people waiting for your seat.  I recommend going out of exit 5 and eating the hotteok (noodle filled bun that us fried) which is sold at the nearby stall."
179,5.0,Dont forget to buy kkultarae (korean honey sweet) from the ajushi. You will know which a jusshi once you reach here because he is quite famous there. A lot of souvenirs you can get here. The price is quite cheaper than Insadong.
180,3.0,Good place for people who love shopping. A lot of thing is selling at this market and you also can bargain with the seller here..bring as local people with you guy if you want to bargain with seller bcoz it easy for communication... enjoy yourself
181,5.0,"Came here to buy all the hand gift, all is cheaper here. K-pop stuff, chocolate, and many is available here. We also have our dinner here. The food is cheaper compare to another place."
182,3.0,"Lots of shops of mostly anything made in Korea (clothing, shoes, etc) but not handcraft. Lots of small restaurants and street food."
183,5.0,"Great place to see what the locals buy.Beware that you must compare prices before buying. The same product can be marked up at 3 times more to a tourist. Some stall owners are not honest and try to pull a fast one on tourists.I will not even bargain or negotiate with such dishonest stall owner. They think tourists are bloody fools.The brands offered here cannot be found in supermarkets or shopping mall. For example,  the seaweed brands sold here cannot be found in local supermarket. Speaking some Mandarin helps alot. The market is entirely outdoor, wear comfortable sports or walking shoes."
184,5.0,"This large market are fantastic place to pick up inexpensive clothing, housewares, fabrics, jewelry, accessories, toys, food, souvenirs and appliances. All products are sold at affordable price and the stores in this area also function as a wholesale market. We got to bargained and bought a cheap t-shirts, brooch and cute souvenirs. We went here twice to shop. This market is seriously crowded, not to mention an endless sprawl of street-vendor stalls. I tried this popular Korean street snack and dessert pancakes filled with hot brown sugar syrup called 'Hotteok' and i love it."
185,4.0,"We love the market as you can find all sorts of things from clothings, shoes, food, accessories, beddings, pots. It is always bustling with energy but the number one must visit spot within the market is the noodle alley. Narrow, noisy but oh so delicious hot and cold korean noodle can be found here. The ahjuma or local aunties who run this place can be insistent as they pull you to their stalls especially when one cannot decide which stall to patronise. Just be firm and select the stall that you fancy. We dont know korean and they dont speak English so we usually just point at the type of noodle others are eating. It is always fun to eat here as we soak up the noisy ambience."
186,4.0,Very crowded area with street hawkers shops. They sale everything there especially clothes and shoes. Prices are cheaper than other places but still not worthy. 3-4 hours are enough.
187,3.0,If you are looking for cheap shopping this is the right place to go.It's too crowded and big erea .. l went there to see a piece of Seoul city where you can find a traditional products. It was a good experience 👌
188,4.0,"Great place to find inexpensive souvenirs, clothes, bags and accessories! It's a typical Asian market packed with stalls crowds looking for bargains. For those who enjoy these markets, and I do, this is a good one."
189,3.0,"Good for street food and souvenirs. Nothing much. If in the neighborhood it's worth it to stop  by. Easy to find. Prices are not the great, specially if you look like s tourist."
190,2.0,"Namdaemun USED to be a great place to grab a good deal and watch traders in the market. That is the Namdaemun I loved and that was the Namedaemun that many - even today - come to see. But sadly, this no longer is the case.The high influx of tourists has made this place a spot for store owners to rip off foreigners. Sub-par goods are sold at a higher price than they're worth and many products on offer seem to come from the same supplier and manufacturer... effectively making browsing useless.One could forgive rising prices of goods as many tourist attractions tend to do that no matter where you are. And you could maybe even forgive the sub-par goods. But what I personally couldn't forgive was the lost authenticity. It's no longer a spot for good honest people to get by on a day's trading. It's no longer a local's hotspot for quality goods at low prices. It is now a tourist trap. Nothing more."
191,3.0,"It's a clean market, I'll give them that; however, it's just that--a market. Same stuff being sold in a lot of stores. There are street food but not as much as the ones in MyeongDong, for sure. If you plan to go here to shop for souvenirs, don't. You may be able to haggle more with the vendors but I don't think you'd get that much of a discount anyway. If you're going to shop for souvenirs, you might as well do that in MyeongDong and InsaDong. I saw items like souvenirs, trinkets, bags, and clothing being sold here that are sold in MyeongDong and InsaDong as well. Unlike those two places though, Namdaemun does not offer anything else aside from that--cheap retail therapy.Don't get me wrong, I liked the fact that I was able to go there and experience it for the first time; however, on my third trip to Seoul, I will not go back there anymore. Unless there is something that I need to buy that can only be found in Namdaemun. I doubt it though. I enjoy the vibe of MyeongDong and InsaDong way too much for me to swap them for Namdaemun.To each his own, I guess. Some people might find Namdaemun a better place to shop. So please, try to visit Namdaemun Market at least once and get a feel of things first."
192,4.0,"The market, whether inside or outside the building have much to offer at cheap price.  Can't haggle much, but the price sure are cheap for good quality stuffs. Souvenirs also can be bought here. I love the Alpha market as there's many toys and adult coloring books and many more to be bought under one roof."
193,5.0,"We didn't allow enough time 3 and half hours, so we saw maybe 20% of the market.  We found many souvenirs to take home.Very convenient to the subway."
194,4.0,"Visit this market just for the experience even if you don't intend buying anything.  It's very big with many stalls selling bags, handbags, gifts, food, clothes shoes and many other items. A word of caution though, know your prices before you buy anything. As a South African, I found I could get similar items much cheaper back home. This is probably because of the Rand dollar exchange rate. Americans and British will find the same items dirt cheap due to their strong currency. I spent about 4 hours at the market and did buy a few items - I couldnt go home empty handed after all!"
195,3.0,"We only window shopped here. This market is a huge opportunity for avid shoppers with a long shopping list. It seems to be a great place for Seoul ultimate souvenir hunting. You can even bargain here, we heard. The ancient art of bargaining always intimidated me so I usually do not make purchases in such markets."
196,5.0,Buy everything here is cheaper Not that many tourist are here that's why.Namdaemun is great for street food as well
197,5.0,If you can't find it here you don't need it. Crammed full of shops and stalls this market will not disappoint. Go hungry and snack at any number of street vendors from pastries to fish cakes and be prepared for a shopping exstavaganza!!
198,3.0,This is a good are to go shopping. It is sort of organized into regions of items grouped together. Rather small compared to Dongdaemun area and the items seemed to be a bit more in cost compared to DDM as well. It is good for trinkets to take home as souvenirs and is close enough to Seoul Station that you can walk.
199,3.0,"Such a big and weird market (in a good way)! Many different kind of food, clothes, plastics etc was for sale. Almost only women were selling on the market... Most of the market is indoors!"
200,4.0,"Great variety of merchandises - toys, cclothing, ginseng, snacks, souvenirs, etc. Lots of stalls with local delight at reasonable prices. Locals & tourists alike gathered here to shop for bargains. Close proximity to many of Seoul places of internet."
201,5.0,"Get lost in this enormous food market and taste the true flavor of korea.  Worth visiting,  very crowded, vendors are kind and helpful but not great with english."
202,4.0,"This place has everything. I particularly enjoyed the jewelry and children's clothes shopping. I walked away with a ton of jewelry that would have cost a fortune in the states. I even found a pair of earrings that I have been wanting from Anthropologie for less than a quarter of the price. Be careful, not all the vendors sell individual pieces, wholesale only. The children's clothing and shoes can be negotiated for great deals, designer quality items going for 10 dollars or less. The market is huge so stop by the visitor booth for maps and directions. The jewelry areas close early afternoon."
203,4.0,"Good place to make your spectacles/glasses here. Very cheap and ready in 1 hour. Go to the one with the orange signboard located at Exit 5 of Hoehyeon Station. Interesting market with cheap souvenirs, lifestyle products and local food. Watch out for the grouchy old people though. Lots of cheap fashion accessories too!"
204,4.0,"It is better to take the subway and alighted at Hoehyeon Station. Our tour guide drove us here in his car during the late afternoon but we got stuck in the traffic jam when we were going back. It is just like in Bangkok, we were stranded in the city center for almost 2 hours before we managed to get to our restaurant for our dinner. Namdaemun Market resembled our traditional market in Chinatown in Singapore during Chinese New Year crowded and squeezing. The market impressed me with many garment stores, eateries and cosmetic jewelry outlet. The way business was conducted was also in a very creative manner. I saw one of the store owner, a guy dressed in ladies' wear and bra shouting at the top of his voice luring his customers in that attire. I just could not hold my laughter anymore when I saw that. It also reminded me of some busy bustling shopping belt in Beijing when I saw the rows and rows of local food under the bright incandescent lighting. I bought some snacks and enjoyed my window shopping round the whole Namdaemun market. You probably need 1-2 hrs to walk around the market. I also walked to the Namdaemun fortress gate and took a photo of the South Gate.Nothing very spectacular about this traditional market but it was the traditional sense that differentiated it from the artistic and aesthetic lane of Isadong or the women's cosmetic shopping belt of Myeongdong."
205,5.0,"A real treat for those who are looking for traditional Korean food it's an interesting way for Koreans to sell their goods to anybody they have all kinds of things like fish ginseng tea it's a fantastic interesting market it's a great place for people watching as well, 😁 if you don't have to spend as much money on clothing this is also a great place to buy decent clothing for very low affordable price"
206,5.0,"I love exploring flea markets wherever I go. Nandaemun is filled with interesting find....food, clothes, souvenirs and Korean delicacies from Ginseng wine to kimchi. The place is full of character and you are bound to find something quirky here!"
207,5.0,"I just love namdaemun market, i was able to get my winter coats at the cheapest price, they are fashionable and used coats .I also love the street food were we got our lunch at very cheap prices. i love this interesting market  i bought a lot."
208,5.0,"plenty to see and buy from Tupperware, clothes, souvenirs to awesome food. Had a great couple of hours here and it's worth a look.  Check out the great south gate while you are here"
209,3.0,"This is a decent market, with pretty cheap food and goods. Lots of different food stalls selling Korean food for very cheap- remember to bring cash, they won't take credit cards. The market is quite large selling everything from seaweed to t-shirts, but we thought the clothes were not that good quality. There's also a large variety of fake designer bags and other fake goods, but this area is good for souvenir shopping (like local candy, handicraft, etc).."
210,4.0,We went to the market with our Korean guides. They know people in the market and were able to buy 2 large king crabs and 16 abalones and have it cooked for 16 people at a restaurant there. Net price was so reasonable that we should have purchase more king crabs.
211,4.0,"Namdaemun Market is very big and is a convenient stop if sightseeing around Sungnyemun Gate (commonly known as Namdaemun gate). Also near the palaces, Namsan, myongdong....It's a bit overpriced as it's sort of a tourist trap. This is a place to haggle. If you don't look Korean, expect to be overcharged...a lot. If you're savvy you can get some good deals. Be warned, some of the vendors are tough to negotiate with. If you feel the vendor is difficult to negotiate with, move on. You can find just about anything you need here from baby clothes to glasses to pots and pans. You can get souvenirs here, usually the same stuff sold in any of the other tourist stops and usually for a lot cheaper. I saw some people buying paper handheld fans in one of the shops at changdeokgung palace for 12,000 krw. They sold the same ones at the market for 3,000. Again, haggle! When going through the main entrances look for people in red vests that help out tourists. They are with the government and are very helpful. They will have maps and many speak English as well as other languages. The market is generally divided into sections like a department store. The food alley is pretty good. But it's a mad house during mealtimes. There are also some underground and indoor market areas that are worth checking out. If you like streetfood there are many stalls selling the regular types found around Seoul. Be conscious of your wallets and bags. While I believe it's relatively safe, it's usually very crowded, especially on weekends and I've heard thieves will target tired and confused tourists (as in any country). There aren’t many places to rest unless you’re in a restaurant. Like many markets around the world, it’s not super clean. Also, the locals spit a lot. Seems disgusting to me but it’s common. Therefore wear appropriate clothes and footwear. I would avoid flipflops in the market during summer. There are bathrooms but use the ones in the subway or a nearby office building, It'll be cleaner. Seriously.Lastly, the market is across the street from Sungnyemun Gate. Since Sungnyemun is a Korean icon it’s worth checking out (for about 5 minutes)."
212,4.0,"Lots of shops selling things ranging from simple souvenirs to clothings to food (snacks & meal) & cosmetics, etc. Along the street, there are a lot of pushcarts selling clothes and other products as well as food. The things are fairly cheap and you can bargain when purchasing certain things like clothes. I found a stall which sells fish cakes at 500 won per stick, it tastes good..Must try.."
213,4.0,"Namdeamun Market offers the best deal for fair price with various ranges of selection for the shopper.If you are looking for souvenir and gift for friends and family members this is the best place to shop. Not only the price is cheaper  but you also can bargain  eg; we can get 3 t shirts with 10,000 won, beautiful brooches  ranging from 3000 won and above and so on. we came here twice to buy gifts and souvenirs. It was the best shopping time we had throughout the tour."
214,3.0,"-reasonable pricing for clothes and u can still bargain. -many local street food u can find here. It's cheap! I especially like the ""kimchi bun"" (dunno what it called), a bite to feel the cottony texture and the following bite u will love the kimchi taste sensation. It's a must try for the Kimchi Lovers! I ate 3 and I definitely will go back for it.. Slurps!!"
215,3.0,"Dongdaemun repeat just that vendors spilled into the streets. Apparel, shoes and local food. No thrills about this, need to bargain."
216,4.0,"I love street markets and street food. And this market met most of my expectations. There were lots of cheap bags, kids clothes, shoes, and great street food. The only thing I dislike was how unfriendly the people selling the stuff seemed. Maybe it was an off day. But it is absolutely worth it to go and shop there."
217,5.0,"Easy to spend hours here walking around, eating street food and shopping. Streets are by type of item like children's clothes, purses, shoes.  Great people watching too. Be sure to bargain on price, but keep it in perspective. Remember one dollar (of any currency ) may not be a lot for you but may be a lot for the vendor."
218,4.0,"Traditional market, not far from Myeongdong. You can find many kinds of things, eg. cloths, souvenirs, accessories, luggage, food, dessert, etc. Should look around many shops and compare the price before buying. Don't forget to bargain to get lower price."
219,4.0,"Namdeamun is a place you will find random treasures, but the main reason we go there is for the armloads of cheap, but beautiful flowers you can get.  A little tricky to find, but worth the effort... it is on the third floor of one of the central buildings in Namdeamun. On other floors you will find potted plants and all sorts of kitchen wares.  Definitely a very interesting place to spend a couple of hours."
220,4.0,Great market for an afternoon stroll. You can buy most anything your heart desires here from knock-off goods to Korean cookware and unique souvenirs. The side alleys are great places to eat local food and most menus are in English. The street food is fantastic and I recommend going in the evening if you want to see more unique foods (although it can get quite busy). The afternoon is more of a calm walking pace without getting pushed and bumped but not as many fun things displayed.
221,5.0,heaven for all Korean food... you name it. I always go where the locals are.. and the price is cheaper than in the restaurants.. plus we casn mingle with all the locals there.. GOOD place!
222,5.0,"This market culminates it all in a sprawling mass of streets, indoor, outdoor and underground.Housing both quality goods and tourist souvenirs, the street food was exceptional and the famous honey strings sweets found in the centre of the market did not disappoint.I walked away with scarves, porcelain, chopsticks, clothes, fans, souvenir toot and jewellery.Those who frequently travel don't expect to be able to barter yourself a bargain, the koreans are very straight up and honest and give a typically fair price originally so are hard pushed to adjust their price."
223,5.0,"Lots of foods, lots of shopping, lots of stuff to do. You can get all your souvenirs here. It's a great place to shop. You can bargain here, you'll get a better deal."
224,4.0,"Korea is famous for its trendy spectacle designs. Walk into Namdaemun market, explore the many shops selling spectacles, choose, and collect your new spectacles in under an hour! The staff here are very helpful and professional, it will be useful if you could speak Mandarin, as some of the staff are korean Chinese since there are huge crowds of Chinese tourists here every day. It's ok if you can't too, you can always use the internationally-friendly-hand gestures to communicate with the staff! The price here is always a bargain, just be sure you walk into the ""right"" shops. I reccommend you explore a few before buying."
225,5.0,"SO MUCH STREET FOOD!!! If you know how to haggle then go for it, because you'll most likely get a better price. Try using Korean too as that certainly helps, even if its basic stuff, they appreciate it and see you've tried which they like a lot."
226,4.0,So many stalls and shops.  Never seen so many in the one place.  Plenty of food stalls around as well.
227,5.0,"Namdaemun market is the oldest and traditional street market in Korea. Namdaemun Market contains shopping mall complexes that sell a variety of goods on each floor, and alleys that are lined with street stalls selling everything from food products, to health products, glasses, luxury/discount cosmetics, traditional Korean souvenirs, and much, much more. Why don't you go and look around? It will be also an exotic experience to have delicious street food."
228,4.0,"When I have the energy, I love going to this market place that has it all. It's truly massive with everything you could imagine from retailers to wholesalers. Best of all, this place still has the feeling of a traditional Korean marketplace. You can expect it to be busy, so charge your batteries before you go!"
229,2.0,"The sales there are damn rude. No smile and always showing you ""black face"". There are only few shops that the sales will give you shine on their face. Mostly selling the same clothings."
230,2.0,"I found the Namdaemun market disappointing. They sell staff basically only to tourists, as locals do not seem to appreciate either the goods, or more likely the prices. You will find clothes, teas and herbs, toys and ribbons, but nothing really worth the visit. Unless you have plenty of time, I would rather visit more interesting parts of the town."
231,4.0,Shop and eat.  As long as you can for as far as you can. This place is huge. You can find absolutely anything you can think of - esp Korean souvenirs.  Easy to get to and open late. Don't forget to try to bargin :)
232,5.0,"This market is huge!!!! Goes for many city blocks. You can  buy anything you can think of, but the best part is the food. You can just wander through & just buy food to snack on because they sell a lot of snacks on sticks for $1 or $2 you won't need any dinner or lunch, just snack!"
233,4.0,"If you want to shop or just window shop in Seoul, Namdaemun is the place to go. You can also find a lot of great street food."
234,4.0,"Went to check this out and get some lunch. This is a huge market selling everything you can imagine. We pretty much just wandered around as I am not much of a shopper but, if you are, there's lots to buy. Had some very tasty lunch at Noodle Alley though and the Chili Fritters were delicious too.."
235,5.0,"This area can be overwhelming and so much fun.  There is so much stuff.  You can get cheap socks, undies, bags, belts, clothes, and so much more.  There are street vendors to try different foods and drinks.  I could have spent my whole afternoon roaming around staring at different stuff.  My nieces were not as enthused after 2 hours.  It is worth it to look through."
236,5.0,"this is the best and cheapest place to buy souvenir. lots of kinds are sold in here, such us Korean cutlery, magnets, key chain, mother of pearls, bookmarks, etc.. the price is the lowest compare to other places and you can't bargain because most the price are fixed price. but, sometimes they will you a gift if you shop a lot. get your ""I Love Korea"" t-shirt in here very cheap. 1000 won, you will get 3 or 2 t-shirts depends on the color that you choose. there are lots of building with different things that they sold. for Korean souvenir, it's on D (orange) building. try grapefruit ade in here.. 3000 won for 1 glass of grapefruit ade."
237,3.0,"A pretty vibrant market with a lot of people, quite a bit of tourists, but def more locals around looking for some bargains, didnt really find anything that i liked but there is a lot to see and especially take photos ofNice but there are other markets around Seoul which i enjoyed more"
238,5.0,"Was a busy and bustling market area, and well worth the walk through.  There seems to be a shop for everyone - you'll not be disappointed in the deals you'll be able to find (or the food options that are plentiful).  Take your time, enjoy the experience!"
239,4.0,"A busy and vibrant market - filled with so many variety of goods with great, tasty and reasonable local food!  They sell everything which I believe forms part of their daily lives as well - clothes, umbrellas, hats, shoes, bags, underwear, toys, accessories! Definitely a place of discovery and an insight into what people eat and buy.  Also visited the wholesaler for accessories/jewelry - wonderful workmanship and lovely designs though mostly only sell wholesale.  Managed to find one or two who sold by piece and they were such beautiful pieces!  Would definitely return and recommend to friends!"
240,5.0,"This is a good place for buying souvenirs to take home, but you must know how to negotiate with discounts up to 60%.    You will see here both tourists and locals.  This is also a good place to drink soju and eat streetfoods just like the locals in a pojangmacha.  This is what we enjoyed the most at Nandaemun.  We got one table and ordered soju, rice cake, tteokboki, japchae and dakochi. We stayed here for almost an hour just like the many locals in our pojangmacha who were enjoying their afternoon socials.  This is is one memorable experience a visitor should try."
241,4.0,Namdaemun Shopping is an older shopping area where a lot of locals go to.  You need to bargain a little but the vendors won't discount as much as before.
242,5.0,"You can find almost everything here. Clothes, accessories, leather goods, food stuff (kimchi!!), home items, and souvenirs. If you don't have much time to shop in Seoul, this is the place you must visit. The prices are cheap too. If you love accessories such as earring, bracelets and necklaces, there are many wholesalers here. Just don't tell them that you are shopping for yourself. If they ask if you are on business, just say YES. Only thing - that means if you shop at one stall, you'll have to get at least 10 pair of items in that shop but they can be of different designs. I got like 29 pairs of earrings each costing about KRW2500 - KRW3500. Remember to bring cash as most of the shops with good bargains accepts Cash only."
243,4.0,"This is a great market to walk through to buy and see everything that you could want. We found the coolest socks, great cell phone cases, interesting hats and tons of local foods. There is also a flower market, jewelry market and some nice galleries and restaurants. A trip to Seoul isn't complete without at least a short trip to this market but if you have the time and patience, you could spend hours here."
244,5.0,"Good news for shopaholics out there. This place is huge and will take several days to cover all of theme. It has women, children, kitchenware, medicine, party supplies, toys sections. It is best to print out or download the map before you explore Namdaemun to save time. Dun forget to bargain while you are there."
245,4.0,"Huge market with food, textiles, clothes, household stuff, souvenirs.  I wasn't really into shopping but lots to see - and as a 6'2"" 200lb guy, probably not a lot to fit me!  Food sections are great - don't miss the delivery people at lunchtime carrying trays on their heads to other stall holders"
246,4.0,"Namdaemun had a great variety of not only items but also styles. There were a lot hoodies and casual clothing but you could also find dressier items as well, even winter coats. The best part of shopping at Nandaemun was that there were larger sizes! Some of the shops in Namdaemun even advertise with signs saying they carry larger sizes and not just for clothes but for shoes as well. There is also a variety in quality where you can get cheap stuff for ~5-10,000 won and high quality stuff that can can be bargained down too. There are a lot a great places to shop but Namdaemun seems to be the place I found most of my purchases due to the variety in style and size. The market is also very close to Namsan and N.Seoul tower, about a 10 minute walk, which makes for a nice day out in Seoul."
247,5.0,"Ok, if you hate crowds, shopping and/or eating.. this is not the place for you. If you  like any of the three.. by all means, check out Namdaemun Market!This place is crowded, frenetic, noisy, bright and fun... and I liked it best at night. People gather here for socializing and eating late evening to late night. Locals and tourists alike seem to enjoy the shopping. While I tried food from a few of the vendors, I most loved people watching and shooting photos.And... when I had enough, I was able to quickly exit to a much different scene, Namdaemun Gate. The docent there was a delight. I know we will stay in touch by email.Seoul is a city of many ancient-modern contrasts. Namdaemun Gate & Market are a great example."
248,4.0,"This Namdaemun market is an morning and afternoon market, located 5 minutes walk from sungnyemun gate. on the way to this market is the street for 2nd hand and new camera and dslr market this one is the biggest camera market in Seoul. The market it self offer from korean traditional food to small thing like wallet and for sure bag and cloth. so many fake brand also with bargain price. this market is for tight budget tourist :) so be smart to bargain any thing at any price  and mostly vendor can not speak english so be prepare with sign or visual languages :) the street food is good but make sure you ask the price because of the development of tourism in the past year this market is full of tourist so make sense some vendor try to take advantage by increasing the price :) some traditional korean handy craft is more cheap here than in castle or any super mall around this place. Try some local cake from the street food if you dare, they re seem clean and tasty also, we try some cake with cinnamon and sugar and it was excellent ! in the night this market are closed but in some corner some 2nd vendor open for antique etc."
249,3.0,"There are many local food and tradition shopping in Namdaemun Market. We didn't spend long there as the prices of the goods tend to be steeper than other local places. We bought a few stuff there and realised the few days later that the stuff we got can be found in other places and it's way cheaper! It's a great place for shopping such as souvenirs, shoes, clothes, shoes and more. They have a variety of goods to shop from. Please note that they close early so be sure to be there early too! We spent about an hour over there and headed off to Myeongdong which is nearby and definitely more shopping for youngsters!

250,4.0,It was a great experience to explore Namdaemun market especially for mature ladies. Most of the clothes are cater for mature ladies. Anyway it was a great experience to explore the market. Check out the street food. Read more in my blog.http://loveanqila.blogspot.sg/2013/09/travelogue-namdaemun-market.html
251,3.0,"It is not the most interesting market in the city but it is a very large market area. You can buy and eat quite typical korean things. There are a lot of clothes and toys shops. It is not a must see but it is interesting to visit if you are in the area. As in almost every quarter in Seoul, you can eat in the street for few money."
252,3.0,It seems like the rustic and bustling market might appeal to westerner. I'm an asian guy from Singapore and the market does not interest me much.
253,3.0,"Namdaemun, in my opinion is the archaic version of Dongdaemun, for obvious reasons. It does offer a huge variety of goods ranging from souvenirs, toys to kids' clothes, daily necessities and dried food though. Prices differ hugely from alley to alley, as based on my experience. Souvenirs there (fans and pouches etc) are a little pricey in my opinion, but clothes are indeed cheap for some shops. Some however, fall on the extorbitant side, ranging from 35,000 won onwards. Service wise, many of the shop owners seem to be pretty jaded, constantly looking tired and unbothered by any patronization. Glum faces and aloof attitudes aplenty. There are some stuff there worth buying though, but careful selection is necessary and bargain as much as possible, if you can.Overall I wouldn't recommend Namdaemun as a must-go place but I guess it serves as a good introduction of traditional market shopping in Seoul. I wouldn't go back though if given a second chance."
254,3.0,must eats would include the famous black rice Hoetteok. Its a very small stall when u walk towards Shinsaegae.another must eat is the Bulgogi Japchae Hoetteok. the stall on the left of the MRT exit is awesome.seaweeds here are abt 20% more expensive then the stall I patronize at Gwangjang Market.It has also became a little more pricey over the years.
255,4.0,This is a huge public market that sells everything you can think of. None of the merchants were willing to haggle I think because they knew I was not a local. Be careful not to get lost as it's really big. We were here for about 3 hours but it would be easy to spend longer. The bathroom I used did not have toilet paper so be sure to bring some.
256,3.0,"If you have time to kill with nothing specific in mind, do have a look around. Else the souvenirs and artisty stuffs are better found in Insadong. This is like your local bazaar - Chow Kit in KL Malaysia. Most stuffs are made in China here. I hate bargaining because I always ended up paying more than somewhere else. The place just isn't for me. The area is quite large and you'd be better off looking around for a better bargain before deciding. The shop owners sometimes ignore you by focusing on those they think are better buyers. My daughter wanted a pair of galoshes. Because we were in a hurry with 3 of my friends being tired of walking around, she ended up paying 5,000KRW more than what she was told the first time she asked - different guy was there when we returned. My friend bought lovely aprons, too nice to be worn I tell you! Other alleys were just filled with clothings, crockery, bags, shoes...You can visit either Dongdaemon or Namdaemon unless you have time and energy to spend."
257,2.0,"The items are overpriced and obviously priced for tourists. They sell food at double the price they would in supermarkets (I stayed in a hotel next to a supermarket). There really isn't all that much to see.It's ok for street food there though, but even then- it's better to go to MyeongDong at night for that. More variety !"
258,4.0,"Street markets in Asia don't really differ that much - bustling streets with roadside stalls selling cheap clothing, souvenirs, food, etc., but they're never out of the travel itinerary. However, Namdaemun Market isn't exactly a place to buy cheap stuff because the prices aren't exactly lower than what you can find in the wholesale markets like in Dongdaemun. Still, there are other special things that you can find here:- You MUST EAT the Hotteok. It's a dessert pancake that has a melted brown sugar+cinnamon+honey filling. It is SO GOOD that I actually went Namdaemun the next day just so I could eat it again.- Explore the food alleys - there're many little restaurants that serve the same foods like kimchichigae, grilled mackerel/pollack, etc, and it's interesting to see the flustered ahjummas cooking outside along the alley. We were a little indecisive about which restaurant to go to, and ended up being dragged by competing stalls side-by-side before one won over. Food was actually quite good, we enjoyed the kimchichigae and wanted more.- If you're a fan of Running Man, you can check out the idol/souvenir shops and buy a t-shirt that comes with the velcro name-tag! I bought a KJK one for a friend and a SJH for myself =D"
259,5.0,"This market is not for the faint of heart.  Yes it's chocked full of tourist. But it's where the commoner comes to shop.  Living in Korea you discover that most of the goods that are sold in your Dong (Korean Neighborhood)  come from the Namdaenum Market.  The Namdaemun Market is really meant to be a wholesalers Market.  So the prices are very good and most vendors will barter with you.  Most people who visit the market are overwhelmed with the over 10,000 shops.  Yes I said 10,000.  You really need to know what you are looking for before going there or you will get lost at looking at everything.  My first few visits to the market I know I was not sure if I liked it or not.  But now when I shop there I know what I'm going for and I can find it at half the price I'd pay in the nicer mall and shopping districts.  Don't be afraid to try the street vendor food.  It's very delicious and safe to eat.  Pros:  You can buy good for half what you would pay else where,  the market is open form   10:00am ~ 5:00am, (yes  5:00 in the morning), Great people watching.  Out door dinning to enjoy your people watching with a beer or some Soju.Cons:  Super crowed, you can get sidetracked easily, too much to see.  Yes there are a lot of Foreigners there (not a bad thing)To avoid the crowds go ether early in the in the day or later in the evening (after 9:00 PM)How to get to Namdaemun Market:  Take line 4 to Hoehyeon Station and leave exits 5, 6 or 7. The market is right in front of the station.  Just follow the crowds."
260,3.0,"It would be worth a visit if it's your first time and you are looking for just gifts and loves exploring a city's traditional market.  I find it too crowded and touristy, and the type and quality of goods reminds me of Beijing's Xiushui market (for those of you who have been there).If you are looking for shopping that is more trendy and interesting, I would suggest Myeong-dong hyper shopping area instead."
261,2.0,"Not a v good place to visit- too touristic and full of the same stuff (seaweed, ginseng, random wooly hats). There is no point in visiting this market when there are so many bigger and nicer ones like myeong dong."
262,4.0,"this is the market you MUST have in your list once you're in South Korea, specifically in Seoul. Namdaemun Market provided you with lots of things...there are many food stalls, souvenirs shops, jewelries, clothes, shoes, ginseng, seaweed products, etc...do not panic if you run out of cash, there is money changer / ATM machine nearby. it is advisable to do BARGAIN. :)"
263,5.0,"The market is huge, branching out left and rights all along the way. Sells many things, food, clothes, cutlery, trinkets.There is also a street with a row of restaurants. The food are not too bad, but the tables were tiny =) The competition is steep! With all the restaurant owners taunting you to go in. But you be happy to know that they show sample of the food outside, so you can decide if its appetizing to you."
264,3.0,We Went to Namdaemun Market on a Sunday which probably wasn't a clever idea as the shopping centre next to it was closed. The market was in full flow though. I didn't personally find anything of interest to myself but there are lots of clothing sellers along with various other stalls and some excellent street food available for when you feel you can't walk any futher. Stay away from the stall selling the boiled/fried bugs as they STINK! I nearly wretched a few times just walking past haha!
265,4.0,"This is a great large market, which was close to the Military base (yongsan) that I served on. I bought many items there during my tour and all. If you have a weak stomach you may want to skip the food area of the market, you will know you are getting close by the smell of it. Be prepared to haggle with them as they will always go lower in price. Lots of shopping to eiter side of the market too."
266,4.0,"Although most of the market sells clothes but there are sme interesting shops if you know where to go. Dont worry its not huge so you wont get lost. Go during the morning for good variety of gift shops handicrafts etc. the prices were amazing. I got many traditional goods from there, the same item you would get in hotel for three times the price. There are sme wholesalers selling at factory prices."
267,4.0,"Best Place to get your i love Korea T-Shirt and souvenir!!! with 10000 won you can get 3 pair of shirt. But if you lucky you can get 4 shirt for 10000 won!!! need pro for this bargain..  :) But bare in mind the quality you get compare to 10000won per shirt. For cute sweater you can get around 20000-30000 won nearly same as what the Running Man use to wear. If you looking for souvenir, instead of nail clipper how bout change it to bookmark. They sell really cute bookmark  which cost around 1000-2000won per piece. Dont forget to buy the korean utensil. The Long Spoon and chopsticks!!! Difficult to find the long spoon in my hometown.. :( For people with tight budget, i recommend to buy ur souvenir at Daedo shopping complex. Its at namdaemun market but difficult to find.. Its cheaper inside the shopping complex than outside.. But it closed early. around 6pm if not mistaken."
268,4.0,"If you know what you want and how much you are willing to spend, you will be a happy shopper.  For example, many friends went to shop for knock-off brand handbags and were delighted with the selection and satisfied with the prices.  I went looking for traditional Korean items and was pleased to have a native take me into the inner store of vendors (not those on the street--but up some stairs into a building just off the street) and find a lovely array of items priced at half retail compared with other places in Seoul.  Some bargaining may pay off, but don't count on it 100 percent of the time.  Buy Korean!This market is definitely worth visiting as part of Seoul.  Just manage your expectations."
269,3.0,"Go here for the local atmosphere - crowds, hustle, bustle, push and shove, but not for the bargains. Dongdaemun Market is so much better, great bargains, less crowds, but shuts by 6pm. The atmosphere at Namdaemun Market is good initially, but after awhile you get tired of the crowds and the heat, especially when the prices are not cheap. Stay a short while, experience the market, tick the box and then go to Dongdaemun Market for real bargains, where you can 'shop till you drop'! Have fun!"
270,3.0,There were roadside stalls selling lower end goods and snacks. Not much of a variety and there were shopkeepers who hide the pirated goods away from sight yet invite you to the back end to view their catalogues. Needs bargaining skills if you must buy from them.
271,3.0,"This place consists of many shops that sell children'wear. On one end it is all children's clothing and accessories, shoes, etc. On the other side is for more matured people. The good thing is they have larger size for pants,dresses, etcPrices are also very cheap S$5 to S$20 for shoes, etc.This reminds me of Chinatown in Singapore but with more shops. They open about 10am daily.There are also some high end malls like Shinsegae Department Store.There are many vendors that lined the street selling korean t shirt,jeans, etc.their jeans are gorgeous but size i reckon small.We bought korean t shirt for $5000 won so that is a steal. They do have sizes.If you love costume jewelleries, you will love this place. Of the three shopping districts; Dongdaemum, Mydeongdon and Namdaemum, each we feel cater to different market.Dongdaemum  is mass marketing, Namdaemum is for kids and family and older folks, Mydeongdon is more for hip outfit and branded stuff plus beauty products. no.3I rate Mydeondon no.1, Dongdaemum no.2 and NamdaemumCosmetic brands to buy that are not availabel in singapore is natue republic. Do buy their cleanser, lotion, face mask. they are really good.The rest ahve stores in Singapore but prices are lower by 3o to 50%The stores also tend to give you many samples. one lipstick cost $5, eye shadow about $7...everything is a steal. Cleaner about $6 so everything is so affortable here and best of all, there is quality.Guys you better go for the BBQ while the ladies shop. Rest assured, we will not be thinking about you guys till we run out of cash..or hands to carry the goodies.So what are you waiting for?There are money changer within teh shopping area and the exchange rate is better than in Singapore at some of these exchange. Aagin, depends on what you really want.The shopping here do not take credit card but eth big department stores do. So better to have korean won.Also be careful cos a 10,000 may also be mistaken as $100,000Now, book your ticket an dhead for land of Kimchee...people culture, sites,  food and shopping all in one experience!Better take direct flight and also the red eye midnite flight.It allows you to sleep and wake up to conquer korea shopping spree!We can't wait to go back very soon.....;)"
272,4.0,Had a blast purchasing souvenirs and trinkets at a mad-bargain price. Loved every minute of it. Felt totally at home (in the streets of Sarojini Nagar in Delhi). Haggled the price of a leather jacket down to half too (yup! Half!) for a friend.
273,4.0,"Here the right place to go shoping for me, since i have no much time to spend in dongdaemun. Of course dongdaemun is more fashionable and more popular to buy clothes but if you explore namdaemun, you will find lot of shop till you lost your energy to explore more. Sourvenir and shirts are cheaper. There one fujifilm shop here, offered affordable price like the one in Chungmuro (which popular among film's shop). at night, this market offer stall selling street food along the street."
274,5.0,"The market is a must see if you've never been there. Sure there are the fake designer items but for some other items, there are some pretty good buys. And the quality is very good in some of the stores.  Sure you can bargain for most items but otherwise the prices for the quality housewares, clothes, underwear are very reasonable.But it doesn't hurt to try.  As for eating, look for where the local office workers are eating.  If the restaurant is packed, maybe its worth trying.  And if you need to exchange money, there are many exchange shops that give you a better rate than the banks. Price around. The market is easily reached via the metro subway or by just walking. And a Shinsegae dept store is right there for the restrooms and more eating delights on the basement level."
