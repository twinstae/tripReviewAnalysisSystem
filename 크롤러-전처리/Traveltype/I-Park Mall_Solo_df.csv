0,4.0,"Like all the big shopping places in Seoul, this has a duty free section. However there are other things going for I-Park. There are a lot more food options, so it is a nice place to have a meal. Also there is a proper supermarket in the B1 & B2 floor, so if you want to buy Korean food this is one of the places to go."

3,5.0,"I went here primarily for their electronics market but if you're expecting something along the lines of Akihabara in Japan, unfortunately, Ipark has nowhere near the volume of Akihbabara.  As well, prices in Korea are more expensive than in the U.S.  For example, I was looking for the Galaxy Tablet and I was getting quoted 700 dollars.  I came back to the U.S. and the price I paid at Costco was about 350-400.  So, even though the Galaxy Tablet is Korean (and you'd think would be cheaper in Korea), the U.S. is still a bigger market and thus, it's cheaper in the U.S. than Korea. Anyway, if electronics isn't your thing there is also a huge mall. Of particular note, there is a store dedicated to Gundam."
