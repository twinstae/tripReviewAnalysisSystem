0,5.0,"If you are going to do one palace, this is the one to do! It is the prettiest out of the 5 palaces in Seoul. They have the secret garden in the back that you can take with a guided tour."
1,5.0,Wonderful and memorable experience though the Palace is smaller than Gyeongbokgung it is still a special place. There are a few hidden spots to photograph.
2,4.0,"I went there during winter, thus the scenery wasn't as great as autumn. Yet, i couldn't help to feel the beauty of the place. It was well preserved  and taken care of. Entrance fee is 3000₩, and there's tour available. The Secret Garden is a must."
3,5.0,"The buildings are lovely here, but for me the main reason to visit is the secret garden. It is wonderful! You enter the garden with a group according to language, but to be honest I ditched them as soon as I was inside as I wanted to do my own thing and some peace and quiet. I was lucky enough to visit during autumn and it didn't disappoint...it was full of beautiful colours. You will need a couple of hours to do the place justice and be prepared to walk up and down and then down and up...totally worth it though.If you arrive in hanbok (Korean traditional dress) you get for free!"
4,3.0,"Great place to visit for the historical feel and exploration. Colours in the winter are generally dull, but was a good cultural heritage site."
5,2.0,"Place is Ok, compared to any other country palace this place is way below my expectations.Only worth it if you wanna dress up with the kimono thing for the photo."
6,4.0,"I feel like after about 3-4 of these, they all start looking the same and you just are like ""meh"", that's how I was anyway after visiting this. For me, the real cool part of the palace is the secret garden. Amazing serene spot free of tourists and great for photos."
7,3.0,Stumbled upon it by accident. It's cute. The admission price is very reasonable. The palace itself and the surrounding grounds are very well looked after.
8,4.0,"This palace is not as crowded and has a huge secret garden or forbidden garden that occupies about 60% of the palace compound. The garden was only accessible to the Korean kings and royal family in the past. The palace itself is not big.  There are free guided tours of palace around 1 hour available in english, chinese and korean. The palace entrance fee is very affordable at around USD3/pax. Garden guided tour fee is a separate fee at USD4/pax and garden tour takes 70 mins. Worth a visit."
9,5.0,"This palace is smaller than Gyeongbokgung palace, but it is still very large, and unlike the larger one, has more original buildings. I recommend taking the english language tour. I feel I got a lot more out of it than just looking at all the pretty buildings, but if you don't have time, grab an english map at the entrance. Also, the signs throughout are in several languages. I also took the secret garden tour, which costs extra. It took me several hours to see everything. I liked this palace best. The tourists and locals walking around in Hanboks made for good pictures too."
10,5.0,"Absolutely magnificent palace complex. I spent about 5 hours wandering around the inner and outer court before exploring the palace itself and the secret gardens.I was mesmerised by it to be honest. I intended to spend a couple of hours, a half day at most, but ended up spending pretty much a whole day here.The gardens are extra, 5000 won, but are well worth it. The place is stunning obviously but don't rush through the inner and outer courtyards as they are just as enchanting.One of the best days I've had on tour in a long, longt ime and definitely the best and most beautiful attraction in  Seoul. An absolute must-do in my opinion."
11,4.0,"This is one of the main palaces of the Joseon Dynasty. It is the most well-preserved, with many structures, gates, rooms, halls and pavilions. The palace is famous for its rear secret (Huwon) garden. A separate ticket is required to visit the rear garden and must join a 90 mins guided tour. The vast garden was a resting place for the royal family and is beautifully landscaped in a way that held on to the original nature of the space. The garden was kept as natural as possible. There are many pavilions, pond and greenery that occupy the compound.I purchased the palace combo ticket, 10,000 won, which entitles to visit 4 palaces and the Jogmyo shrine."
12,5.0,A must visit to this UNESCO site!  Peaceful and glorious. A nicer palace to wander around and well preserved buildings.  Secret Garden tour must be booked ahead of time and highly recommended
13,3.0,"Not as beautiful as the Gyeongbokgung to be honest and you must go to the secret garden following a guife, you cannot enter by yourself and it's not worth one and half hour.."
14,4.0,"Following the Japanese Invasion both the first and main Gyeongbokgung Palace and this secondary palace were destroyed, but Changdeokgung Palace was rebuilt quickly and then became the main palace. This unique Korean palace was built in harmony with the landscape and is a true beauty. I did not go to the Secret Gardens though. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Walking thru both Palaces and the Bukchon Hanbok Village will take up much of your day so it's best to get an early start and then head to Insadong Street to browse and eat. These are some of the best sites to see in this section of Seoul."
15,5.0,"This was the second palace I visited and it was the better of the 2. It was ready to get to. I arrived at 9 and it was a great time for picture taking before the crowds. Later school children showed up and it was a lot busier. I took the free English your at 10:15 and paid for the secret garden tour at 11:30. I suggest you take the garden tour, well worth it. There are his to climb, so be aware. You can opt to return to the palace ground before the more strenuous party of the tour."
16,3.0,"Not bad but doesn't compare to the temples elsewhere in South East Asia. Its expansive lots of areas to explore but no magic ""wow"" moments!"
17,5.0,"The palace is very nice, but the garden is so much nicer. Lots of trees, so a nice place to visit on a hot day. Entering the garden is kinda weird. You have to buy a ticket for a specific time and only at that time you can enter the garden, even though the sign at the garden entrance says you can just go in on your own. You can choose to do a guided tour or walk around on your own."
18,4.0,"I came here to see history and culture of Korea. I really enjoyed it. The palace is beautiful, and there are things, like crafts to do around the area."
19,4.0,Went after lunch and was not as crowded as the other palaces. Unfortunately the secret garden was closed. Still lots of things to see.
20,4.0,"I enjoyed my visit of Changdeokgung palace, however I do prefer Gyeongbokgung palace personally. Of course the secret garden was the best part about this palace and for me, the main reason for going. Worth a visit!"
21,5.0,Went to the Palace with the group but I didn't get enough time to look at everything so I went back on my own few days later. There was some dancing and  the changing of the guards which was very colorful and noisy and very very interestingThete was also a very well presented publication which was free  about the Palace. Many of the people there were in  traditional costumes. There is no charge to go in. The Folk Park is located just up the street in the same area the admission us 3.000 won into the Palace from there but if you wear the traditional costume  the price for admission is free.Go to the folk park first and then the palaces. It is a good half day of exploring in wonderful surroundings.
22,5.0,"This palace comprises many different buildings and squares, all very photogenic. With limited time, I visited the queen's buildings. Well worth a longer stay"
23,5.0,"Changdeokgung is divided into two major complexes, the palace complex and the secret garden complex. Each has its own tickets. The free entry perk of wearing hanbok (Korean traditional clothings) does not apply to Changdeokgung's secret garden. You still have to buy the ticket to get into the garden.Perhaps because it was used as some sort of recreational lodge, Changdeokgung is constructed in a more scenic relax fashion than other palaces. I would say this is the Korean version of Versailles.The rear garden has several interesting stops, but it will take quite an effort to walk down its hilly path. It definitely some stamina as the guide walk you roughly 1.5km up and down path. The garden is an GUIDED TOUR only section, you can't enter it alone. Make sure you check its schedule before you go.The ideal duration to wander around at Changdeokgung, including its rear garden, can be 2hr 30 minutes. Its garden tour itself can last around 1hr 30minutes, spare yourself another one full hour to enjoy its palace complex. It is quite a spectacle as well.Best time to visit Changdeokgung is early April (Spring, the cherry blossom season), and Autumn."
24,5.0,"This is an excellent large site with some nicely restored buildings. It looks particularly good in April with the cherry blossom and the azaleas. The visit to the Secret Garden is the icing on the cake, although my visit was marred by the group being too large, with young people in period dress (nice touch),,,but they were too noisy and wanting to take selfies all the time. The Palace, like the others is free to 65+, but the garden costs, and it best to book on line to ensure a place."
25,5.0,Never been to a Palace before. But this place is worth the visit.The area is just so vast and you can see a lot of  tourists on their hanbok dresses.
26,4.0,must see sitebeside also a secret gardenhas a cafe insidehuge palace groundshas a 3ooo korean won entry fee
27,3.0,"They require an extra 5,000 won and you must follow a guided tour. I saw enough for the first 3,000 won."
28,2.0,nothing to shout about for this palace.  most of the smaller palaces within this palace are cordoned off from public.
29,5.0,"I visited on a public holiday and admission was free (!) which was a nice surprise, considering there are not many things that are free in this world. The changing of the guards was mind blowing.  The Seoul Tourism Board tries hard to give tourists what they want in order to boost this revenue stream."
30,5.0,"今年秋天終於排上日程，剛好可以參加古宮的夜間導覽。＊注意!外國人只有周日場次。我提前一個月上網買票，因為聽說很熱門，有時可能搶不到票。前些年已經去過兩次昌德宮，但這是第一次夜間參觀，氣氛格外不同，安靜、神秘、美好。英文導覽員的英文很好，說得不多，但很清楚。記得一定要早點報到，因為是所有隊伍一齊在門外集合，等門開了才會魚貫進入。(自己腦補: 等待的時候有點像古代朝臣在宮門外等候上朝的那種感覺^^)其實夜間能看到的古蹟特色比較少，畢竟天色已暗。但另有一股韻味(不透露太多，才能好好體會)。雖然收費較高，但包含一場很不錯的國樂與舞蹈等表演，還有小小點心盒。*注意: 入秋後首爾日夜溫差大，整場tour都在戶外，若當天剛好遇上低溫冷鋒之類的，建議帽子、圍巾、手套都戴上。*景福宮也有夜間參訪，買票時記得看清楚是景福宮(星光紀行)還是昌德宮(月光紀行)。兩者內容稍有不同，票價與時間長短也有差異。I visited this palace twice before during daytime. This was my first Moonlight Tour to this ancient palace. It provided a different feel when walking in the quiet night. Open your ears and eyes, for there's music and performance. * This tour is only offered in a limited period ever spring and autumn. For foreigners, only Sunday nights are available, so plan your tour ahead if you're interested. * If you want to really see the beauty of architecture, visit during daytime -- it's really dark during this Moonlight Tour so you won't be able to see much palace features. * They would give you an earphone guide-set and a lantern to light your way. The English guide spoke good English. Note: The more famous palace -Gyeongbokgung- has a nighttime tour too, called Starlight Tour. There's some difference in the content of these two tours. In sum, this Tour is totally worthwhile, and it provides a unique experience. Keep warm, though, for temperatures could drop suddenly in spring/autumn nights in Seoul. Arrive early to check-in -- all visitors would lineup and wait for the gate to open and enter all-together. You can purchase online beforehand. The tickets could sometimes be sold out since this is a popular tour."
31,4.0,"You need to go with the free guided tour they provided, otherwise I don’t think you will enjoy it that much. The structure looks practically the same and there are so many small doors leading to small streets that you may get lost in it. But I like this one better than the gyeongbokgung, maybe because not so many people visiting it so not that crowded, you can really enjoy the scenery and imagine how the life’s like there when it’s still used by the royal family."
32,4.0,"In autumn, the palace is not as attractive as the best time to go there is late March (Spring time). The main reason for my going there in autumn is to visit firstly this palace and secondly the adjoining Changgyeonggung. From Insa-dong where I usually stay, it is an easy walk to this palace. If you would like to see these two palaces and Gyeongbokgung nearby, it is recommended that you firstly enter Changdeokgung, thence into Changgyeonggung (through its entrance next to the ticket booth, in front of the Secret Garden) and walk back to the front of Changdeokgung.  From there a taxi will take you to Gyeongbokgung in less than 10 minutes (around 3,000 won). I have tried getting a taxi at the far-end exit of Changgyeonggung without success, as the taxi drivers told me to get out (due to wrong traffic directions).I visited the Secret Garden several times and found it not too hard to buy a ticket (of any language session) from the above-mentioned booth, as I am interested only in the scenery and not in long historical narratives. In autumn, Changgyeonggung nearby is more attractive. If you look around, there are many beautiful maple trees."
33,3.0,"I concentrated on the Secret Garden. The stroll through it during autumn was really nice. After seeing one compound, they all started to look the same. I would have liked to have seen onsite guides as to what i'm looking at, i.e. living quarters, bedroom, office."
34,5.0,"When you visit Changdeokgung Palace and find yourself surrounded by its gardens, its structures, and the people dressed in Hanbok, that is exactly how you will feel. You can almost imagine what it would be like to be a resident of this palace back in the 1400s.I would suggest getting to Changdeokgung Palace earlier during the day, so as not to be surrounded by too many tourists and visitors. That way, you can immerse yourself in the calm environment and feel a sense of ease and serenity. It will just be you, the palace, and the few birds singing in the distance."
35,4.0,"Walking around the buildings and the grounds is great.  After a while, the temples and palaces all start to look alike, but this one is certainly worth a visit."
36,5.0,"While in Korea or anywhere in Asia, these temples are a great reflection of the past and a window to the future. Simply enjoyable culture found no where else."
37,5.0,"I visited this place last spring but I am still  curious about its autumn 🍂 look. I can say that autumn is the best time to visit. It is more relaxing 😎 and refreshing especially to see the foliage of 🌳🌳 🌲 🌲 🍂  🍁 . May be the scenery is more beautiful on the last week of October because the foliage is definitely brighter and more colorful. I went there on the second week of October and some trees started to change and they looked  wonderful. You can choose to stay within the group and listen to the tour guide ,but if you like to explore on your own within the area they allowed, you can do it."
38,4.0,Nice place to roam around admire the structural and architectural history of Seoul considering this palace offers some structures being built earlier than the other palaces in the surrounding area. The Secret Garden tour provides more access to different areas and also great views. It's a short hike up and down some small hills but definitely worth the extra fee.
39,4.0,I love the forrest and the lake beside the palace. It's so fresh and it makes me feel peacefully. That's all of my feeling. The architect of the places are normal and there's only the walls. I dont find any culture things in this.
40,5.0,"There's so much to do and see here as inside there are also entrances to Changyeonggung Palace and the Secret Garden Tour. The architecture of this complex is so outstanding that it was inscribed on the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage List in 1997. Also, I'd highly, highly recommend the Secret Garden Tour, just make sure you get there early enough because there are limited tickets available for each time slot."
41,2.0,"Not much to see.Buildings from yesterday, almost nothing is original, everything rebuilt in the last years... it is just worthed because what happened arround there... no interest"
42,4.0,Nice place to stroll and check Korean architecture. You can follow the local guide provided by the palace if you want to understand more. Many girls rent Korean traditional dresses for selfies here.
43,5.0,"I wanted an English tour of the Secret Garden at 10.30 am. Limited number of tickets, only 50 per tour. Since I found it difficult to book online I went to Anguk station by metro and reached the ticket booth at 8.45 am. They open at 9. Only a few other people were there so I booked the tour and walked around the palace from 9 to 10.15. Loved it. And loved the Secret Garden."
44,5.0,This isn’t the main palace but I believe to be the most scenic of them all.  Definite must do is to take the guided tour of the Secret Garden which is the real jewel here.  It is an extra 5000 won but it is really beautiful and you gain a good sense of history.  They don’t allow access to the garden except for on the tours.  The garden is massive and it takes about 90 minutes for the tour.
45,4.0,Really beautiful grounds and very tranquil - absolutely recommend the secret garden tour if you are visiting.  I was staying in the Insadong area and the palace is easily found on foot from Jongno 3 sam ga metro station
46,2.0,"I went on the Secret Garden tour in Changdeokgung Palace and it was a real disappointment.  The gardens themselves were pretty but what could have been done in 30 minutes max was dragged out to 60 minutes with lots of “have 15 minutes to look around” moments.  Our guide (CJ I think her name was) could not have been any less interested in taking the tour if she tried. She was sarcastic, moaned about everything from the loudness of the birds to having to carry a parasol, deliberately isolated herself from the group even when she said she’d answer questions, didn’t take us to one of the points on the map and was not enthusiastic at all.  Such a shame as what she actually had to say was interesting but it all seemed to be rushed and glossed over.  If you are visiting Changdeokgung Palace I would probably take the Palace guided tour and give the Secret Garden a miss."
47,4.0,"So I visited all the palaces and shrines that are included in the pass you can buy for a slight discount (you can get it at any of them at the entrance gate).  if you are limited on time this is the best one to visit.  There is another palace right next to it but it is a separate entrance fee so you can easily hit up two of them.  The additional charge for the secret garden is worth it, especially if you go in the summer to get some shade!  It is located in an area that has lots of other sites as well."
48,5.0,"The style of Korean Palace architecture and beautifully painted exteriors really appears to me and this one was my favorite of those I visited.  I especially liked the ""secret garden"" acessed by paying an additional fee and waiting to the appointed time to be led through by a guide.  Despite the crowd herded through this way the extensive gardens, pavilions, lakes and so on were beautiful and worth the extra time and expense. It is very hilly with lots of steps so you may want to think twice is you have physical limitations."
49,3.0,"The palace is somewhat small, as the building are all rebuilt to resembles the original structure, looks too good order to be a 600 year old historical site.  However, it’s a good mock up to know the history of Korea.  A small palace, not really too much to see.  King’s life looks boring."
50,4.0,Definitely worth going to see. The whole complex is great. I would recommend visiting if you’re unsure.
51,4.0,"Beautiful attraction right in the middle of the town. Wonderfully kept gardens and ancient buildings. Museum of Contemporary Art is also on site, and the entrance fee for both attractions is very cheap."
52,5.0,Make sure you see the secret garden tour when you are there. It really made the experience worth it.
53,4.0,"Interesting contrast to the more linear layout of the Gyeongbokgung Palace, with buildings following the gradient of the land.  Plan an additional 90mins for the guided tour of the Secret Garden (additional entry fee, check tour times).  Easy walk between Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung Palaces (can detour via Insadong shopping precinct) means both can be visited on same day."
54,4.0,"This was a great place to tour in and around, and I found that I could learn a great deal about Korean history as a result.It was a day of perfect weather with rippling cerulean blue skies outside and that just added to the ambience."
55,4.0,"This is my college roommate's favorite palace, so this is the sole palace I visited. I especially loved watching the girls, mostly, in traditional hanbok taking selfies and photo shoots. I was able to witness the changing of the guard, and partook in the tea and traditional sweets in the Sujong room. Admittedly the tea and sweets were approximately $25, and I didn't get my money's worth, but it's for the experience and I have no regrets. The grounds were gorgeous and went on and on. There were musicians playing in the background and I couldn't resist take part of getting my photo taken in a hanbok on a regal throne as it was free for tourists."
56,3.0,"I went later in the day so I missed the last Secret Garden tour gog foreigners, it turns out you're not allowed on your own and in my opinion without the secret garden it's good but not great.The gift shop had some great items at very low cost!"
57,5.0,You can just picture how the royal family lived there. Take a few hours to wonder around and discover all the corners of this beautiful palace. The secret garden is also worth a visit!
58,5.0,"It´s such a beautiful palace with an extraordinary design. You need to walk around in any corner you can, it worth it. Prepare your camera to take some photos, wear sneakers and an umbrella if it is raining."
59,5.0,"Ok so you will probably end up at Gyeongbokgung since it's the 'main' palace. But once inside, it's nice, not great. Changdeokgung is without a doubt the better of the two. Most friends and family who come to Korea also agree. It's not symmetric, but it's a lot more peaceful, and there are many hidden spots without people, even on crowded days. The secret garden at the back is worth visiting, but you need to book this at the ticket office and English tours only run several times a day, check their official site for times."
60,3.0,"Although I very much appreciated the chance to see the heritage sites, there is too much concrete re-working for it to feel totally authentic."
61,5.0,The Changdeokgung Palace is very popular in late March/ early April as the cherry blossoms flourish. The most popular spot is in front of the Secret Garden entrance where visitors pose for photos. The palace is easy to go. I usually walk from Insa-dong to the palace within half-an-hour. From the palace one could walk into Changgyeonggung; there is an entrance to it just behind the small Secret Garden ticket office.
62,3.0,"I still think their palaces all look a like. Same colors and desgins but of course, there are differences in structures. You can come to this place then enter the Secret Garden tour as well. This is also walking distance from Insadong so if you are around Insadong, you may drop by."
63,5.0,"I happened to be staying down the street from this palace so I walked over there on a Tuesday and happened upon the English seaking tour.  I also rented the sudio tour but the live (free) tour was so much better.  Given that it was weekday, the group was not huge (30?) and the guide was really great at making sure we all kept up and heard what she told us aboutt he palace, the symbolism and the lives of the Korean royals.  Definitely a must-do on a visit to Seoul!"
64,5.0,"this is a must when visiting Seoul. there are several options, single ticket for the palace or palace and secret gardens. The secret gardens can only be visited by guided tour and these seem to be very popular and sell out quickly. There is another entrance to a palace for an additional fee too close to the secret garden entrance. People can access the palace grounds for free if they get dressed up in traditional clothes"
65,5.0,"See this temple at night when the lighting creates a magical display of wonderful landscaping, curving pathways and majestic Korean temples.  It is less crowded at night and allows for a dreamy contemplation of the ancient beauty of this place.  It was free to enter the Tuesday night I went. I think it is $7 USD at other times but well worth that price."
66,5.0,"Good exercise if you like to walk, traditional show in the afternoon, lots of people dress up Korean clothes."
67,4.0,beautiful building and charming pictures..must visit for first time visitors. many Koreans with traditional dresses.nice view.
68,5.0,Visited Seoul and got advices to visit the old Kings palace.  Magnificent place for details different from one in Beijing with color ( green) and that there is more nature inside. The best thing was the guard change: it happens .. every day 2 timesI tell you times soon They follow traditional ceremony that tells loads about local ways. Times:Small one: 10:00 and 12:00Big one 11:00 and 14:00Cost incide is 3000 won .... but if you wears traditional outfit you can walk in for free. So better find a shop and dress like local for a day.
69,4.0,It's one of the top attractions in Seoul. Looks similar to Gyeongbukgung palace. Haven't had a chance to see the secret gardens inside but it was cool looking at all the buildings.
70,5.0,"The guards swapping every hour through the middle of the day is a must watch, its completely free and is a real treat"
71,5.0,It is my favorite palace and has the beautiful secret garden which you can only see on a tour. Recommend!
72,4.0,Out of the 5 palaces this was the most enjoyable and worth a visit. The secret garden was beautiful and really brought a sense of peace to a busy bustling city. The English your guide was informative with a a sense of humour. This was a highlight.
73,5.0,"For me this was my favourite palace in Seoul. I also visited the larger Gyengbokgung Palace, which although impressive I feel could not compete with the beautiful secret garden at Changdeokgung. I would definitely recommend doing the secret garden tour, our guide was wonderful and very informative."
74,5.0,"Seoul City Walking Tours will give you a free walking tour (search on Google and reserve)! I highly recommend a tour because had I don't this myself, although incredible, I would have missed A TON! Tour takes 2 hours and gives you a lot of great information about the significance of the architecture and the history. This palace is beautifully maintained. I did not go to the gardens because it was winter and I had something else I wanted to do (can only go into the secret gardens with a guided tour that lasts 70 minutes, check times for when your language is offered before you visit)"
75,4.0,"Interesting  place and I was exited to see the palace  on my first day of arrival  in Seoul ,  it's more fun to see the ceremony  and change of guards"
76,5.0,perfect example of Korean palace architecture. fortunately almost empty during visit. it made me feel peaceful.
77,3.0,"Went to see the secret garden.In winter, at least, there is no garden to see in the sense of plants or landscapes. Rather this is a tour of the private palace buildings that you can't otherwise access. Quite interesting and a good guide, but don't expect beautiful plush interiors that you'd see in British or European palaces - these are external views with a few empty rooms. OK but not a must-do."
78,5.0,"Go! Just go there and see it for yourself! I couldn't take enough pictures of the complex. It's also right next to Changgyeong Palace, so you can hit up both at the same time."
79,5.0,"Wonderfully beautiful in history, tradition and architecture.  Many locals opt to rent traditional outfits and come to the Palace to pay their respects.  Selfies galore and of course people taking photos of groups and so on.  I especially loved the idea that during the week there were many school field trips so the grounds were abundant with young people....and young people love to practice their English on you.  Had a ball meeting and conversing with so many locals."
80,5.0,"I'm not usually one for wandering around scenery but I was really happy with the secret garden tour. Granted,  the group was quite big 40+ ish people, and the tickets tend to sell out, so pre book or turn up early. Despite it being winter there were still nice photos to be taken. The little cafe near the secret garden entrances does some deliciously warming thick rice teas.But the 5 stars especially is because the helpful ticket clerk, instead of just selling me the secret garden and admission for I think 8000W, she checked if I was visiting other palaces, when I said yes, she highly recommended I buy the combined ticket and even asked me to have a good read of the info available before buying. She saved me several thousand Won as the combined ticket was 10,000 Won and I used it to get into 3 palaces, Secret Garden and JongMyo shrine. Really appreciated her thoroughness and helpfulness."
81,4.0,"The Secret Garden Tour was definitely  engrossing in the depths of winter, and led by a feisty, very well presented guide with a strong American accent. It's remarkable to think that less than five minutes from the serene atmosphere of this palace, and some of the surrounding streets, that you're confronted with a grim duel carriageway bloated with traffic. I like these contrasts in Seoul."
82,5.0,I cannot describe this place and also this location by using words but I can say something before go this place. When do you wanna go there you have to consider the day. I mean this place is close at tuesday and also the palace in city hall close at every monday. Have a nice trip!
83,5.0,What a great little escape in the middle of the city.  Very picturesque with colorful scenery.  Stop by for a little oasis.
84,5.0,This palace is my favourite palace between the other 3 palaces. The secret garden is so beautiful and enjoyable to see.
85,5.0,This palace is a Unesco world heritage site and is for me a more notable palace in the heart of Seoul. Its big and amazing. The palace's history I think is one of the oldest among the palaces in Seoul. Entrance is free if you are wearing a hanbok.
86,4.0,I liked the places as it symbolizes the Korean culture and Korean civilization. The change of guard ceremony is particularly unique and an experience
87,5.0,This is by far the most charming palace with its famous Secret Garden. There are English tours and during fall you can tour the secret garden on your own. There are also limited night tours with cultural events.
88,4.0,"Our destination for today is Changdeokgung Palace. It is better to drop-off at Anguk Station Subway Exit 3, because it is just 5 minutes walk away from the Palace. English guided tour starts at 10:30am.Also visit Secret Garden when you have time."
89,5.0,"As far as palace goes, I very much prefer the much grander Gyeongbokgung Palace. But this palace has something that draws you in the moment you step in the secret garden (you have to take a tour for this). My guide is amazing and you can almost imagine the royalties walking the path towards the secret garden for some R&R. The fall colours make the place even more magical than the name suggests, making you wish you have a secret garden of your own too."
90,5.0,I loved this place! The fall colors were fantastic! The garden is very beautiful and you have a view of the city as well. A little shop has nice souvenirs.
91,5.0,"Changdeokgung Palace was the second royal villa built following the construction of Gyeongbukgung Palace in 1405. It was the principal palace for many kings of the Joseon Dynasty, and is the most well-preserved of the five remaining royal Joseon palaces. The palace grounds are comprised of a public palace area, a royal family residence building, and the rear garden. Known as a place of rest for the kings, the rear garden boasts a gigantic tree that is over 300 years old, a small pond and a pavilion.

92,5.0,Visited in the afternoon and was really enamoured by the splendid pagodas and vast expanse of history right in the midst of the modern city . To top it all that day it was open in the evening also with a concert which really made it a memorable experience!! Definitely worth a visit and do not miss an evening opening if available.
93,4.0,Tip for visitors - the Secret Garden is the highlight of this palace visit - remember to leave enough time to go from wandering the grounds to where the start of the tour is - takes longer and might not be as straightforward as you think!
94,5.0,"Lovely skyline divided by a historic palace wall. I felt the cultural significance through dance and music. The change of guard, power of love and traditional customs and architecture are all well displayed, Just turn around and the new development are visible indication of enterprise."
95,4.0,"Most reviews I read recommended the secret garden tour and I would agree.  You have to get a reservation in advance.  They only have 100 spots for each tour and 50 are available for online reservation 6 days ahead at 10am.  I went on the site and signed up at exactly 10am.  Once I finished I looked back at the site and there were 0 remaining spots so they go quick!  Once you arrive you have to show the reservation and actually buy the ticket.  If you plan to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace as well, but the Integrated ticket instead and save 1000 or more.  The tour is normally 90min long but they are doing a trial and allowing you to just walk on your own.  Had I known this I wouldnt have bothered with the english tour and picked a better time.  At my own pace I finished in about an hour."
96,4.0,"I visited four of the fives palaces but this to me is the best, even if some buildings are in maintenace period now"
97,5.0,I visited this palace with a tour guide in a tour group. This palace is beautiful and certainly worth a visit when you are in Seoul. I took lots of photos with the palace in the background: a picture speaks a thousand words.
98,5.0,"The entire site is a modern rebuild of a palace that once stood on this site. It's a shame, because clearly the original must have been very spectacular. The rebuild is interesting enough, but you cannot enter any of the buildings at all and those that have their doors open (and that's not very many) have little to see inside. It's also very busy with noisy tour groups and school children. Regardless, it's not to be missed. Buy the Royal Palace Pass for W10,000 as it's a BIG saving on the six sites it includes. The Secret Garden is a separate tour, but is actually more interesting than the palace, but you can only visit the garden if you visit the palace too. The Pass package includes both."
99,5.0,"The highlight for me aside from the rich architecture was the secret garden tour. I actually went back three times on the same day for it because I kept missing the time or the available tickets. They kept telling me I'm late even though I was 30 minutes early. Only thing I muttered was ""But I ran all the way here from the station."" Luckily, I got to be part of the 3pm Huwon tour and it was well worth it.Changdeokgung is interconnected with another palace known as Changgyeonggung. It is located just beside the entrance for the secret garden tour. It's a small palace unlike the other ones but worth a visit if you're into history."
100,5.0,"This place is amazing. The main entrance fee is $3,000W. It is worth it 100%. There is some temples that were under reconstruction but still a good place to visit. It is very easy to get here via subway or bus. Make sure you go early because the later you go the busier it gets."
101,4.0,"Spent a long day exploring this vast complex great walk and really enjoyed the Museum so much to see, fascinating insight to Korean Culture"
102,4.0,"I went here because I read about the history of this palace. It's a good place to enjoy the history, plus if you're wearing Korean Traditonal Hanbok, you can get free admission to enter the palace."
103,5.0,"Beautiful palace with many, many buildings and details. In hindsight I should have taken an English tour so that the use of everything was made clear to me. But nevertheless beautiful area to stroll around and to admire those ancient Korean architects."
104,5.0,"This palace is an easy walk form exit 3 of Anguk subway station.It costs W3000, but the secret garden is W5000 extra. The palace is closed on Mondays.The main palace is self guided though there are tours in English at 1015 and 1315 daily.The secret Garden is guided tour only and numbers for each tour are limited. The tour takes about 90 minutes, though there is a leave early opportunity after about 50-60 minutes if you are short of time. English tours take place at 1030, 1130, 1430 and 1530 during early spring to late autumn.The palace was built in about 1405 and was in use for hundreds of years. The secret garden comprises many valleys and pools and is fascinating though it is not possible to get close to some of the buildings.The palace alone, without the garden would take 30-60 minutes."
105,5.0,"Tip: Buy the combined palace tickets to get access to all the palaces and the Jongmyo Shrine. Combined tickets last for a month.Don't miss this palace, the largest in Seoul and with a Secret Garden to visit - this is more of a parkland than garden which can be booked online up to 6 days in advance for guided tours in English and other languages.Get off at Anguk station exit 3 and walk along big road, you need to continue walking at the corner of the fences behind which the palace lays as the ticket office is a little further along. Go mid week for fewer people and better pictures."
106,4.0,"I was really looking forward to visiting Huwon (secret garden), but I found the tour to be stifling. You can only visit Huwon by tour and there are strict rules to stick with your tour group of 40-50 people so you can't explore by yourself and there's always tons of people milling around--definitely makes for a less-than-peaceful experience. Also, Huwon was pretty, but not breathtakingly beautiful--at least not in the summer. All said, I don't think you'd be missing out on too much if you only visited Gyeongbokgung and skipped Changdeokgung."
107,5.0,"You must reserve your spot online at least 24 hours in advance and then pay 8,000 KRW at the ticket booth upon arrival.The tour lasts about 70 minutes and is worth the commitment. If you love Josean architecture and behind the scenes stories, be sure to visit the palace and sign on for the tour!"
108,5.0,"I was amazed to have a chance to walk narrow streets of the palace mostly by myself. I was early, but still. The palace has many hidden places and is nicely maintained."
109,4.0,"The palace compound is well preserved so it is not too much of a stretch of the imagination to visualise life for the royals and for those living behind the scenes. I got there not long after opening so was able to explore in peace and relative solitude...(before the tour groups)! While you can not enter any of the buildings, it is certainly worth a couple of hours visit. It is also easy to visit Changgyeonggung Palace as you can enter this site from the Changdeokgung Palace grounds."
110,5.0,"I read about a Moonlight guided tour of this palace from 8 PM - 10 PM on Sunday nights from June 2017 - November 2017, so I jumped on the opportunity and booked the ticket 3 months in advance of my trip. I was not disappointed - this palace is seriously SO beautiful. Between Gyeonbokgung (the large main palace in Seoul at the city center) and this palace, I MUCH preferred Changdeokgung. The guided tour at night was great, and had an English speaking guide (they offer Korean, English, and Chinese). We went through the palace and learned about the different buildings and architecture. The secret garden is only open to moonlight tour guests and we got to see that too - it was absolutely stunning with the library lit up in the background over the pond. There were traditional musicians throughout the palace as well, playing the traditional flute, and someone was playing a gayageum in the garden. After the actual tour, there was also a cultural performance, where we saw two traditional Korean dances, heard a traditional music performance by a Korean ensemble, and heard one of the traditional Korean stories that are sung by the storyteller. We got to try special tea and foods as well, and got a little gift of 6 gold bookmarks with Changdeokgung's special window architecture on them. Overall, for 32,000 Won (~$30) I would highly recommend that people get tickets to this event, or if not at least go see the palace sometime during the day. I'm not sure what the regular day admission is for the palace, but I'm sure it's less than the moonlight tour. Maybe about 10,000 Won (~$10)? But I'm not totally sure."
111,5.0,"Changdeokgung Palace was the second royak villa built in 1405. It is the most preserved of the five remaining royal Joseon palaces. After it's destruction during the Japanese invasion, it was rebuilt in 1610 and served as the main palace for about 270 years. Injeongjeon Hall is the throne, which was used for holding formal state events. Seonjeongjeon Hall is the rulers council hall and the only remaining palace with blue glazed roof tiles. The kings residence is Huijeongdang Hall, while the queen is Daejojeon Hall. Entrance fee to the palace grounds is 3,000 Korean Won. English guided tour is available. Also make sure not to miss the Palace Secret Garden which requires a separate entrance fee. It's a must. You can reach the Palace by Jongno-3 Station Line 1,3 or 5 Exit 6 or Line 3 Anguk Station Exit 3."
112,5.0,I think this Palace is one of the most beautiful places in Soul. You are in the middle of the city but is so peaceful and quiet.
113,5.0,"This palace rightly is UNESCO classified and worth visiting. I was even more impressed by the entertaining 90 minute guided tour of the Secret Garden. You have to take a scheduled guided tour to visit this area and it is well worth the time if you have it. You don't have to be ""into gardens"" to enjoy the beauty of this historical oasis."
114,5.0,Fascinating palace of the Joseon era. English tour was excellent and very informative as well as free! Highly recommended if you want to learn about the history of Seoul and Korea.
115,5.0,Beautiful monument in the middle of this incredible modern city.  The contrast between the contemporary and ancient is an interesting experience.
116,5.0,Another one of the palaces that is a must-visit in Seoul. Arrive early if you want to avoid the crowds. Recommend joining in a Secret Garden Tour to make your experience complete.
117,5.0,See it...see both of the palaces that is next to each other. You can buy the tickets to the other palace Inside the area. There is a guard border between this two palaces and ticket sell is there. You need half a day to just walk around and enjoy the calm
118,5.0,The visit to this palace shall include the visit to Secret Garden(visiting time and numbers of visitor is limited) to watch the beautiful and wonderful King's garden.
119,5.0,"It's good to be emperor-- you get the biggest room! Since you must see the local palace, this is a good one. Make sure you get there in time for the changing of the guard which is colorful but clearly performed for the tourists."
120,5.0,"Despite an extra fee, you will discover the beauty and the harmony of the secret gardens during an one hour and a half guided tour. Then you can continue to visit the palace."
121,4.0,"the secret garden stuff is amazing and enjoyable, but other than that everything is pretty much the same as gyeongbokgung, cultural palace. i do prefer the gyeongbokgung but the secret garden stuff is worth it.and also less people wearing hanbok (other alternative to wear hanbok and take a picture of urself)"
122,5.0,"The place is amazing, the ticket is really cheap and there are some guided tours (that take more than an hour) in english and I think also other languages. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!Be careful, it is CLOSED on mondays or tuesdays.. (i cant remember)!"
123,5.0,"My favorite of the Palaces as it is built into hilly landscape. The buildings are well laid out with many interesting angles and details. But it's crowning glory is the Secret Garden. Garden Tour can be purchased separate from entry to Palace and in my opinion is a must. Only a couple of English speaking tours in an afternoon so plan accordingly. We had a very large group but the very capable tour guide, OK(her initials) had it well in hand. Don't miss the lovely little gift shop!"
124,4.0,This was my favourite palace of the ones that I visited. The grounds are expansive. The Secret Garden at the back [separate entry] was very tranquil. My only reservation--applicable to all the palaces--is they are empty of furniture. This palace is one of the two eastern palaces that can readily be visited as a tandem and is all very close to the Jongmyo Shrine.
125,4.0,I was positively surprised...Living in China I have seen a lot of palaces and temples etc. and usually it's all more or less the same. This one was worth to enter for 3.000... Not supercool but different than others...
126,5.0,"It was wonderful place especially in spring! I can see a Korean palace with beautiful sky in harmony.Actually I considered to visit Gyeongbokgung or Changdeokgung just befort a day of visit.But I'm sure Changdeokgung is better because I've heard several comments about Gyeonbokgung that there are too much people to enjoy that place.However Changdeokgung is good enough to enjoy the gung with nice weather, beautiful building and so on.And I recommend to use an application the ""Real, Changdeokgung"" which guides you based on your location. It is very helpful to tour Changdeokgung.Alwasy it's true that ""Your knowledge determines your insight.""At that point, it was awesome and to wonderful application to visit Changdeokgung."
127,5.0,"The secret garden should be more interesting during the fall ! The different types of trees would certainly be a feast for the eyes! Foliage was all green only when I visited. The entrance fee was 3 000 won, & there is a separate charge to enter the secret garden (5000 won) It would be nice to get 1 or 2 k won discount if buy it together though!The palace itself is interesting as the orientation differs from most other palaces. Changyunggung can be accessed inside the palace. Entrance of 1000 won can be purchased at gate, & with proof of the changdeokgung ticket stub, can re enter from the same place . Worth to do it together ."
128,5.0,"You really shouldn't miss the lovely Changdeokgung palace in Seoul, one of the five grand palaces built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty. The buildings are wonderful, colorful and impressive, but the highlight of my visit to the palace grounds was no doubt the guided walk through the Secret Garden. Make sure to include this in your visit! The guide was very knowledgeable and spoke excellent English. I visited the gardens in early March, but would love to go back in spring, summer or fall to enjoy the changing colors of the beautiful trees and flowers. Must be quite a sight!Highly recommended. A must visit when in Seoul."
129,4.0,The palace is great but the secret garden is  definitely worth it. Only a few dollars to walk though gorgeous greenery.
130,3.0,Yes really similar to Gyeongbokgung palace but still nice to see and walk around. I also booked a tour to the secret garden (I booked it 4 days in advance) but I wouldn't recommend it in winter or early march/april. We had a lovely english tour guide but the secret garden is nothing I haven't seen before and it can be hard for some people to walk up the steep hill. I would only go back to the secret garden in autumn other than that I would skip it to be honest.
131,5.0,This is a world heritage site. I went on a day visit. It was great. You can walk around and learn about the history of Joseon South Korea. There are lots of restaurants near by and places to rest along your walk.
132,4.0,"Not to miss if you are in Seoul historical area. Similar to Gyeongbokgung palace for most of the people. Maybe experts will notice some differences.Nevertheless interesting walk through the various buildings (however not allowed to go inside) and the park.During spring time the trees are starting to bloom and everything becomes beautiful.For people not speaking korean language, there are free guided tours provided in other languages (english, chinese, japanese,..)The entry fee of 3000W (approx. 3$) is very reasonable. You may add 5000W (5$) for the secret garden which is part of the park but only accessible at certain times and number of visitors is limited to 100 per tour in order to preserve the area."
133,4.0,"The palace complex is similar to many others. If you have been to a few palaces it's more of the same.  If it's your first one then it's great as it id not too large.  Palace took over an hour to explore.  Worth popping in to the Secret Garden at the back...An additional 5000 won for the 90min tour. Very pretty garden and a nice change from the palace buildings.  Interesting contrast seeing city buildings all around the palace.Easily accessible from Anguk station on the orange line. Take exit 3 and walk straight ahead. 5 mins max.Bukchon area is very close by too with traditional homes, restaurants and shopping."
134,5.0,"The place reminds me of the forbidden palace in Beijing. However, the place is much simpler and smaller.I'd still say it's a place you must visit on your first trip to Seoul."
135,5.0,"This palace is beautiful and it is a more manageable size. It was a quiet day in October when I visited and the Secret Garden tour made it more special. English tours are available and they sold out fast, so plan the trip in advance. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and patient, gave everybody an opportunity to ask question and take pictures. It was beautiful and also a bit sad to see the pound in the format of the unified Koreas (South and North) and makes you wish that one day they become the same country again.It is a lot of walking up and downhill and the tour ends in a place where you need to climb uneven stairs but it is manageable"
136,4.0,"Interesting palaces and gardens. Unfortunately in February no flowers or leaves on trees so the beauty of the gardens could not be seen. Good guides, especially my group had a very good guide for the Secret Garden tour. The Secret Garden tour is limited to groups of max 100 persons. Plenty of walking so not good for people with limited mobility. Not fun to visit on a rainy day."
137,5.0,"It long hard journey to come there by walking.. the secret garden there very beauty...scarlet heart actress are acting there... it worth to come., many of historical evidence you may learn.. i love the tour guide explanation all about the secret garden..please come there in the 4 season..the beauty views for 4 season are different..i suggest come on spring. All flower bloom and winter also you may see the frozen lake..."
138,4.0,"I love history and looking at architecture. Hence, visiting the palaces in South Korea is a must. You can visit Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung, Gyeongbokgung and Deoksugung at 10,000KRW by purchasing the combined ticket. This also includes Jongmyo shrine which I did not visit as I'm not interested. Visiting in Winter is definitely cold and you won't be able to see the pretty flowers and beautiful green scenery (if you want to see those, the in-house guide said spring/autumn is good). But it gives another sense of imagination as the in-house guide brings you around the palaces - the reality of power struggle within the palace - together with the cold winter. Architecture and the reason why certain places were built are interesting too. Definitely a must visit if you want to go deeper into the history of Korea. Of course, you won't become an expert at it but at least a good understanding if you follow through the guide or simply just download the app for each palaces and just walk through it by reading."
139,4.0,"Changdeokgung Palace is worth the visit considering that it is a UNESCO world heritage site. The temples and open spaces are not as grand as the newer Gyeongbokgung Palace, but its charm is rooted in the simplicity and humility of the structure and in the magnificent lay-out of the secret garden (accessible upon payment of additional 5,000 KRW). The views of the palace and the garden, however, are not as breath-taking as the views during spring or autumn. With all humility, winter views are only great if snow is thick and not yet melting. During our visit, snow is already melting, and all that's left were leafless trees and frozen ponds. Consolation comes from our tour guide who shared interesting trivia about the palace and gardens."
140,5.0,"You can't miss this place. Make sure you go there with lots of time (i would say at least 3hours) to explore the area. And please wear comfartable clothes and shoes because you will be walking a LOT.Paying for the guided tour is important for you to learn a lot the local history.Take time to choose a quiet spot, sit down and observe Korea people who goes there. You would be amazed how much you can learn by observing the way they interact with each other, how they respect their culture and people.I was truly amazed!!!"
141,4.0,Running second best to Gyeongbokgung this palace still has a thing or two and can hold its own. I really wanted to do the secret garden but it was closed on the day that I visited.
142,4.0,"Like the other palace, the place is well preserved and restored.I would have enjoyed myself more if there were more signages and explanation boards to indicate and describe to visitors of the various locations of the palace, since I did not join any guided tour groups. I ended up walking to places where there were just closed up rooms.Due to time constraint, I missed the Secret Garden that needed a separate ticket, probably do it on my next visit."
143,4.0,The palace has a lot of history..This is a must visit when in Seoul.  The Bus and or the subway will get you there
144,4.0,"Not as huge and ""sprawling"" (way to the back) as Gyeongbokgung and also not as ""brightly colorful"" with ceremonial guards & big guard ceremony as at Gyeongbokgung (saw no ceremonial guard whatsoever at the gate here), the ""highlight"" of this palace that sets it apart from all the other palaces is its so-called 'Secret Garden' (a.k.a. Huwon) all the way at the back which is actually a ""big park"" with grown trees, some ponds, beautiful small pavilions (& a pretty big pavilion on a high ground which is off-limits to the public) and an enclosed area with these traditional wooden row buildings forming a perimeter (guess it was like a royal resting place back in the day when they were in the garden, and also learned that the Joseon kings & queens actually took part in planting of trees & such activities, maybe as called for by the royal customs & tradition); I went in with the 12-pm Korean tour (missed my 11-am or 1130-am English tour) which took an hour & a half but it was such a ""well-timed & comfortable"" tour with only like a 10-minute walk at most between every two stops (about six stops in total) and places to sit down at each stop, so an hour & a half went by ""quite pleasantly"".Another part of interest on the palace grounds is the residential area at the far end on one side (a left turn from the main pathway past the main palace building with the throne stage, or a right turn after coming out of the tour of the Secret Garden) where the last emperor of Korea & his wife after him spent their last years during the Japanese occupation.  And a little ""out of the way"" from the rest of the Palace because it's on the other side of the main pathway from the rest of the Palace (a right turn from the main pathway just before getting to the Garden entrance, or a left turn after coming out of the Garden tour) is an enclosed area which was the place for the concubine of one of the Joseon kings.Coming by subway, Anguk Station (on Line 3) is the nearest one with just a 5-to-10-minute walk east straight on the big Yulgok-ro St. to this palace.  There's also the royal residence (not a palace) called Unhyeongung between the station and this palace (but you'll have to do a slight detour by turning right & walking a short distance to get there after coming out of the station).  And right beside this palace is another palace called Changgyeonggung which you can actually ""very conveniently"" get to by going out the back exit (right beside the Secret Garden entrance) where you'll get to the high ground overlooking Changgyeonggung with stairs to go down to that palace.As for the ticket, I suggest getting an ""integrated ticket"" for 10,000 won which is good for a month and which covers this palace and three other palaces namely the main palace Gyeongbokgung, Changgyeonggung (right beside here as mentioned above) & Deoksugung plus Jongmyo Shrine (also just in the vicinity of this palace); and do keep in mind that this palace along with Changgyeonggung & Deoksugung are closed on Mondays and Gyeongbokgung & Jongmyo Shrine are closed on Tuesdays."
145,4.0,"- visited November 2016- went just a few hours before closing time, so there was no crowd, and it was quiet and peaceful- better if you purchase the Royal Palace Pass worth 10000 won, which grants access to this palace, plus Gyeongbokgung, Changgyeonggung, Deoksugung, and Jongmyo"
146,4.0,This is a little smaller than others but it has a lot of history.  There are signs explaining everything and they are in English.  some of the buildings have some furniture inside but not may.  It is worth it so come and visit.
147,5.0,"Visit this palace in the late autumn. Great chance for autumn leaves viewing when discover secret garden. To sight seeing the secret garden, you need to reserve the ticket online or buy on sight at ticket box soon."
148,4.0,"This palace is said to be built during the Josun period in the 14th century. Overall the place is nice and beautiful. The interesting part is the main building like a royal court, where there's an interesting dragon decoration high up in the ceiling where visitors can only see it from a certain angle. It's beautiful. There's also a cafeteria and souvenir shop in one of the buildings inside the palace's grounds."
149,4.0,"Traditional, well preserved, very clean and obviously well looked after. Wish I could access more and I wish I could have spent more time here! It is a wonderful place to go and learn about Korea and it's culture and history"
150,5.0,"The palace is located in the center of Seoul, so it is easy to get there. The entrance fee is quiet reasonable likewise other palaces in South Korea.You could breathe the life of royalties and their servants there.In addition, there is a remarkable garden inside of the palace.That is called 'Secret Garden', one of UNESCO's World Heritage sites in the palace. To visit the garden, it would be better to book the tour in advance since there is a limitation of number of people per each tour. If you visit there, you will be able to enjoy the small pavilions which is in harmony with beautiful nature.The nearest subway station is Anguk Station, orange line(line number 3)."
151,5.0,"I enjoyed visiting this palace especially the Huwon Secret Garden. We joined the japanese tour, better check the english tour schedule in ever. It's great to explore this place."
152,4.0,This was a nice lesson in Korea's history. The changing of the guards was a nice show to see. The museum is nice for the timeline of events.
153,4.0,"World Heritage Site of UNESCO. Well done, Koreans! The place is really well maintained. The entrance fee is quite low so accessible for representatives of different layers of the society. I saw many nursery school students here, that shows that Koreans teach their young about the roots of the nation. The architecture of the palaces and other dwellings is purely Korean, so authenticity is well preserved. Recommended for lazy walk in the nice weather. The visitors in the Korean national costumes enter the place for free )))"
154,5.0,"Living nearby, I literally rolled out of bed to catch the English guided tour at 10:30am on Saturday. It was a 5 mins walk & hard to get out of bed with the cold weather. But I am glad I did it. This is my 3rd palace for the week. And though I missed the glorious autumn leaves (I was rewarded at Deoksugung), this palace is not a UNESCO heritage site for nothing. It is the grandest of the 3 palaces I visited (the other being Gyeonbokgung) and it suitably named as a palace. The Korean Tourist Office has done a wonderful job managing my expectations that it is not as grand as China's. This palace has the history and grandeur. Our guide was the best guide of all the tours I had. She speaks English with an American accent and it was easy to understand her. As my tour ends at 11:25pm, I rushed to the Secret Garden's English Tour which starts at 11:30am. Trust me, it was super freezing and I was having second thoughts. Especially when our guide was warning as of the long walk and steps. Then I looked around. There are folks with strollers! I have to press on !! One-third through the tour, at this beautiful part with the pond & the pavilion is.......it started to snow !! Magical !! And the snow got heavier & heavier. I'd never forget this  special moment! The last time I experienced this, it was in Nikko Japan, and that was about 10 years ago! So it you are only in Seoul for a short time, and have to choose ONE to go.....this is the one. It was too cold for me to linger around after the cold. So I hurried back to get my umbrella and to watch to snow falling out of my window before catching authentic lunch at a hanok.If you are in the area, end your tour with lunch at Gung Hanjeogsik. You need to cross the right traffic light, coming out from main entrance. Walk straight down the first road, then turn left. It's not easy to find, but worth it!  I have come to realised, this trip, that having many reviews in TA on a particular restaurant is not necessarily the best. It could have been overly commercialised. It's super! And if you want stretch your visit to this area more, visit the"
155,4.0,"it was the maple season when i went there. Inside the secret garden, it's like walking into a different world, amazingly beautiful!"
156,5.0,"Changdeokgung Palace is a very nice place for a taste of Korean history, a nice escape inside the city. Very relaxing walking, to admire the beautiful nature and to take pictures.Don't forget visiting the Secret Garden, it is quieter and less crowded because you must book a tour to enter. Tip : wear your hanbok for free admission but you will have to buy tickets to enter the Secret Garden ( Trust me, would be very worthy !! )"
157,4.0,This is a UNESCO heritage site with some amazing traditional architecture. Well worth a visit. Get there at 9 when it opens to beat the crowds though to be honest it was never as crowded as many top tourist sites around the world these days. So quite refreshing really.
158,5.0,"If you're a fan of historical dramas from Korea this is a MUST VISIT place! It looks exactly as it is on the dramas. We went there when it was Chuseok so there we're cultural performances which was really cool. The entrance fee is cheap and if your wear a Hanbok (traditional Korean clothes) which you can rent in stores outside the palace, your entrance fee is waived. Next time, I wanna try going there at night."
159,4.0,"Rented the audio guide and took a guided tour of the Secret Garden as well.Very interesting facts about the palace's history and sights,rituals of the people such as floor heating were revealed by our guide.Sadly,I couldn't visit the Geyongbokgung Palace but this made up for it somehow.The Quen's,King's and the Prince's palace were very mesmerising.Do remember,the Secert Garden has an additional fee and times to be visited with an English guide."
160,5.0,It's very impressive with all the different sections and buildings.Make sure you visit the palaces and the secret garden with their guide tours as the information provided are very useful and interesting.Best time of the year to visit is in autumn and have your camera ready to take plenty of photos.
161,4.0,Very impressive palace grounds. Have visited in two separate trips. Very expansive. Only issue was long ticket lines on Sunday.
162,3.0,"This palace looks like other palaces close to it, mid of november would be nice to visit, especially it's secret garden, you can see colorful leaves there."
163,4.0,"Changdeokgung Palace popular with the Secret Garden tour. the palace looks similar to palaces in Gyeongbokgung Palace. but the Secret Garden is a different view. to enter the garden, you need to follow the tour, held with the schedule. just come at the ticket booth of Changdeokgung, and see the schedule there. it have tour guide in English. really good!"
164,4.0,Part of the tour was a visit to Changdeokung Palace. Its design is not as detailed and intricate as that of Gyeongbokgung.  It is much simpler and there were few people who visited this palace.  Considered as Changdeokgung Palace was recognized as a World Cultural Heritage site by the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Committee.
165,5.0,The secret garden is definitely worth exploring. It has nice leafy gardens and nice little pavilions. The tranquility make the visit very intimate. A bit of difference from the Gyeongbukgong.
166,4.0,"All the palaces in Seoul are alike. If you are not a specializing in korean history  than visit one or two will be enough. This one one of the most famous one. It has two parts palaces and garden. For the garden you  require separate ticket - be careful and ask in advance in ticket office, you only can access garden like a part of free guided tour but you have to purchase ticket first and if you will stack in the queue you are risking to be late for the tour. Then you will not be able to enter till the next tour (which will be in 2 hours). There are also free guided tours for buildings parts - which is nice because otherwise you will be just looking on many empty buildings."
167,5.0,Spent a couple of hours here straight after arriving.  Very pleasant and affordable.  Lots to see and very interesting.  Lots of young Korean girls and boys wandering around in traditional costume and happy to have pic's taken.
168,5.0,"I stayed at a hostel just 200m away from this place so I could come in in early morning and stayed til closed, with visited to Secret Garden.  The palace is really big so, I really liked to take my time to enjoy and take photos, read information, relax and watch the locals, children in their tradition dress.The palace is very big, well preserved.  A lot of small garden, areas... if you can ask for the map it will be very helpful.  The buildings, houses, temples, gates, halls... are quite impressive.  Peaceful after all the tourists have left.  I left the Secret Garden, separate ticket, til 1400, after I saw the palace.  It was just me.  But in the late afternoon when all the tourists went home, and a lot of locals, couples would be there in their traditional dress.  Really enjoyable time, quite place to see the true tranquillity of the place.Ask the locals for photographs, they are more than welcome to let you do it and offer to take photo for them too :)"
169,5.0,"This palace is well-preserved. I quite large and not famous for tourist like Gyeongbokgung palace. the secret garden is very good and neat. you don't need to go with the tour guide, it's more peaceful and have time to relax :)"
170,4.0,"The palace is lovely, but the gardens are the real attraction. You do have to buy an extra ticket to view the gardens but it's inexpensive. Once inside wander the paths and you'll find the various gardens, each with their own charm. There are some nice places to sit and take everything on as well."
171,5.0,"This vast palace complex is packed with beautiful buildings that would be massive draws by themselves in any other city in the world. The concentration of stunning architecture, huge courtyards and beautiful gardens is just wonderful. There are larger single temples in many places but here it's on an incredible scale I've not seen before. And it costs less than £2.50 to visit! Also, I went on a Monday afternoon and saw a military parade in traditional dress too, which was great."
172,4.0,It is a great place to just walk around like 1-2 hours was enough for me. Also you can go to the other palace next to it where the elder leaders residence was.
173,4.0,"Almost gave this place a miss.  Am glad I didn't.  Enjoy the experience, in particular the morning guard changing session which was an eye opener for me."
174,5.0,"Pros: UNESCO world heritage site, beautiful architecture and grounds, free tours in multiple languagesCons: Can be crowded (especially with school groups), historical perspective is missed without the tour guide explanations, lots of walking.I visited the palace on an afternoon in October; the weather was perfect for a few hours outside.  Although there were quite a few school groups there, I didn't have to wait to take the tours in English.  I purchased the combined ticket (palace &a secret garden) for 8,000 won - a bargain in my opinion.The architecture was really neat, from the designs and colors to the building sizes and concepts.  The tour guides did a great job of explaining the little details that you might overlook; for example, I would never have guessed that the larger doorways were only for the emperor, while the smaller doorways were for the government officials and others - using those smaller doorways required the individuals to ""bow"" as the entered.Personally, while I enjoyed the palace grounds, I liked the secret garden better; but this was due in part to the excellent tour guide and her details on how it was used by the emperors.  The explanations and history changed the experience, bringing the buildings to life as one considers what it must have been like in the garden hundreds of years ago.  I did note that the tour moves at a fairly set pace, and it is better if you focus on staying with the guide so you can see and hear her details - you can always walk back through areas at your own pace then the tour is over."
175,5.0,Went to the secret garden tour. Must visit when you go to this place. Lot of walking involved. Wear comfortable footwear.
176,3.0,"It's 3,000W to get in then another 5,000W for the secret garden tour. A nice bunch of buildings but to be honest A LOT of it is inaccessible (you can only look from the outside), there isn't too much in between (the grounds feel sparse), and of course so little of it is original. A huge number of people come here each day so I wouldn't call it peaceful but an ok place to visit if it's the only palace you go to while in Seoul."
177,4.0,"As with all my reviews to sights in Seoul I will preface this by advising visitors to carefully check opening days and times and whether timed entry tickets are needed to access certain parts of the attraction (such as the Secret Garden here) and also the times for booking guided tours in their language of preference – bearing in mind that numbers can be limitedThe buildings in the main palace area are impressive in their size and magnificence - highly restored and in some cases I guess recreationsThe entrance ticket does not allow access to the Secret Garden a separate timed ticket has to be obtained (and can be pre booked online). You pick a time that coincides with your preferred language (numbers are limited to 30 per tour) Luckily you do not have to stick with the tour guide - but can wander off and look around the garden independently. It covers an immense area and is hilly in parts. Even with a limit on numbers it does get very crowded - especially with noisy school parties - so not such a ""secret""!!Everything was well maintained with some of the areas being restored. Throughout the site visitor amenities are excellent"
178,5.0,All the buildings are conserved and maintained very well. It's a really good place for those who want to learn about Korean history. There were groups of school kids maybe on school trip.
179,5.0,"Different from Gyeongbokgung with the layout of the buildings done in such a way as to blend with the topography, this is a beautiful place. I visited both here and Gyeongbokgung and if you have time for only one of the two, this is the one. Excellent free tours in English.Entrance is a frankly ridiculous 3000 won, and a small guide book at 500 won can surely hardly cover the printing cost.Plan your visit to make sure that you get the tour of the Huwon secret gardens. Twice the size of the palace area, these are just stunning but can only be visited as part of a tour, with numbers limited, and costs a further 5000 won (buy both tickets at the same time). Be aware that there is walking involved, not all of it flat, and the tour takes a little time. The palace tour will finish in time for the Huwon tour, and close to where it starts. I got the 10.30 palace tour and the 11.30 Huwon tour and was finished at 13.00."
180,4.0,"Yes, join the city tour for free!Add 10.00 and you get a traditional korean lunch.The palace itself is huge, some stairs, not handicapped accessible.Interesting history of an ancient culture.I wish they have some handouts in different languages since some of the tour guides doesn't speak fluent English."
181,4.0,I didn't pay the entrance fee 3000 KRW (korean won) because it's free on Wednesday of the last week of the months. All palaces are free except the secret garden (5000 KRW) that is behind the changdeokgung. It takes around hour to finish the tour of the palace.
182,3.0,"This palace has definitely more buildings to visit than Gyeongbokgung, but here you do not have any change of guards ceremony to watch. I found the visit not really exciting, as the buildings look like very similar as the ones in Gyeongbokgung."
183,4.0,"Changdeokgung Palace is located not far away from both Anguk station and Jongnosam-ga metro staion. It is 15 minutes walk. The palace is vast and has 2 sections, the Main Palace and the Secret Garden. Both have its entrance fee. Visiting this world heritage complex needs 2 hours walk around. It is a beautiful place to visit."
184,4.0,A wonderful place to wander around a learn about the history of Korea. Come early in the morning to avoid crowds and to take the best pictures.
185,5.0,Excellent example of royal architecture for the Joseon period.  Well worth visiting to soak up the historical atmosphere and to see how royalty lived.
186,5.0,"You wont need too much time here , just a overall look not more than 30 minutes. This is the most important sign of seoul when you visit .Great place for history lovers.You can also find some tour leaders to receive detailed information."
187,5.0,Built in 1405 as a secondary palace with a secret garden.  I recommend visiting both the palace and the garden.  You must have a tour guide for the garden so plan according to tour times.  It is quite breathtaking.
188,4.0,A couple of hours tops is what you should spend here. They have a lovely garden and the changing of the guard is good to see.
189,5.0,This is a beautiful place. If you watch historical Korean dramas you have to go here. This is one of the palaces in the stories.
190,5.0,The most beautiful sceneries I've seen in Seoul. A huge garden (do the Secret Garden tour - about 6 euros) with architecture of the palace objects fitting the surroundings in a beautiful fashion. Everything sits together perfectly in a picturesque way. This was in summer - it gets even prettier in autumn or winter (we've seen pictures). ;) And the tour guide was a Korean lady with the best English I've heard in this whole week I spent in Seoul (this helps a lot if you wanna hear the explanations).
191,5.0,"This is one of the most favored palace by the kings from all other palaces. More colorful, amazing structures, the Secret Garden, makes the place really special. The secret garden tour is a must here. The overall place is big and lots of history to catch. Very near from Gyeongbokgung Palace & Bukchon village,"
192,3.0,Not bad for making some photo or for walking. Secret garden was closed with no written advertising on ticket-ofice
193,5.0,"Gate guard changing is a must see -- once. Then come back for the better air, temperature, quieter atmosphere and smaller crowds than on the streets outside. Avoid in evenings and on weekends."
194,4.0,"There are several palaces of this type in Seoul. If you are expecting a palace in the European sense you will be disappointed. Korean palaces are interesting and quite unique, but, for me, a little goes quite a long way. I would recommend visiting one (or two maximum) palace (give yourself about an hour) and then move on to something else."
195,4.0,"I'd recommend this as your first stop in Seoul to get a feel for what Korea has to offer. It will most likely also be all the palaces and temples you will want to see for your whole time in Seoul, which is fair because there's so much more to do in the city.Maybe my expectations were too high, but while I found it was nice to walk around and experience something I don't normally see which is of high historic value, I found it a little underwhelming. Although for such a low price it's definitely worth it.You're free to walk around by yourself without a tour, plenty of opportunities to take photos, the tour isn't really essential unless you want to learn a lot about the history. The Secret Garden tour is reasonably good and gives you enough information about the palace to keep you satisfied. Even then, you're not really missing out if you don't take a tour, but it's still nice to do.Jongmyo is the only place in the area where you've forced to take a tour 6 days of the week, so if you have limited time I'd recommend not taking any tours here."
196,4.0,"Another lovely palace. I was too tired to join the Secret garden tour. I had walked all the sights that day and the tour is 90mins, but supposed to be great. Enjoyed looking around palace. Cheap entry and quiet (3.30pm Saturday)"
197,5.0,"Gorgeous palace with a far wider variety of buildings than Gyeongbokgung, make sure you attend the secret garden tour for some of the most stunning views and architecture you'll see in Seoul. Also, it is quiet and positively serene compared to the crowds of GBG which was full of Chinese tour groups."
198,4.0,"Unfortunately I didn't make it to the Secret Garden. However the 1hr guided tour thru the palace was also very interesting. The English from the guide is very good and understandable, tho a bit rushed due to the 1hr limitation. It could have been longer and detailed in my opinion. Well preserved site. I went on a weekday in the morning. So there is kinda less buzzle, I get to take pictures without too many people in front of it."
199,1.0,If you cannot go inside the palace then why you go? Just to walk around!. It supposed to be a king palace but there was no furniture or maybe there was inside and I didn't pay attention for it.
200,5.0,"Definitely this is the most beautiful palace in Seoul. I would totally recommend to buy the ticket for both the general entrance and the secret garden. Tip: you can only access the secret garden by tour, so I recommend to book by website or come early."
201,4.0,"Among palaces in Seoul, Changdeokgun isn't the biggest. It is smaller compared to other palaces but has a beautiful garden and a museum. This museum is exclusive for reservation first."
202,3.0,"If you've been to Gyeongbokgun palace, Changdeokgung is probably something you can skip if you're in a hurry. Changdeokgung is smaller and has more traditional housing.  It is very similiar in terms of structure, the look etc... i liked the long walk towards the main palace (on the left) as many korean drama has that.If you're into korean history, then I would recommend to visit. If not, it probably won't be that interesting/exciting."
203,5.0,The palace is steeped with heritage and history and is declared so by UNESCO. The rooms are decorated very well and each room has its purpose of having. The Kings throne and the feast he would have is very interesting to watch. A must visit for all. I went twice to visit
204,5.0,"The real star of this place is the Hiwon, secret garden area. It's about a 55 minute tour and be sure to bring good walking shoes. The secret garden tour fills up fast and they offer it to English speakers only a few times a day so come early to get a ticket (an extra cost to the general admission ticket) If you purchase the combination ticket book you just have to show your secret garden part of the book to get a ticket."
205,4.0,"This was a great alternative to the more famous Gyeongbokgung Palace, which was closed on the only day I was in Seoul. The structures around the palace complex are magnificent and well-preserved and the guide for my tour gave a lot of good info about the palace and its place in Korean history and culture."
206,4.0,Our annual Rotary International convention was held in Seoul Korea this year. We took a few extra days for sightseeing. This Palace was one of the highlights for me. I love history and I love beautiful things. This inexpensive tour combines both of those. I love the way it Korean culture honors its history. This is a beautiful place to visit without spending too many dollars. You can do the whole thing in an hour or two. I also very much enjoyed the museum adjacent to the Palace. Air-conditioned and a nice restaurant inside it was a good diversion in the middle of a hot day. If you can do this with the tour guide it is even better. Too many things that you simply would not understand without having a guide.
207,4.0,"You don't need to budget a whole half day here, but certainly make it an early morning or late afternoon stop. A visit is worth cost of admission, and if you like history, try to link up for a guided tour (or at least the audio tour)--it's well organized."
208,4.0,"The general palace area is nice and sprawling, and on the weekday that i went, I could find places that were relatively quiet. When I arrived, I pondered a bit over whether to spring extra for the garden tour and I'm glad I did. I can see why they need it to be guided as it's a wide open space with a few built up areas connected by paths. Letting people roam freely around historical buildings with little supervision would be way trouble. it can get crowded with the tour throng but the uniqueness of the pavilions makes it worthwhile."
209,5.0,"I agree with the guidebook-this is the best palace in Seoul. The highlight is the beautiful secret garden. The garden is nice in winter but on my return in Spring, I was amazed at how lovely it is. The landscaping is amazing and the tour guide will add some good information (the quality of tour guides varies-the first in winter was great, the second in spring was OK but less interesting). Free tours are given of the palace but I the guide was not interesting for this tour-I think he was inexperienced. The palace area itself is nice but remember that palaces in South Korea are more simple when compared to German palaces. Those that visited Germany will find the contrast interesting."
210,5.0,The secret garden is definitely worth exploring. It has nice leafy gardens and nice little pavilions. The tranquility make the visit very intimate. A bit of difference from the Gyeongbukgong.
211,3.0,"I don't know why I wasn't really impressed by palaces overall, it's an average place to see and take pictures."
212,4.0,"While not the biggest palace- this is probably the most visited of the 5 palaces in Seoul. While the biggest palace- Gyeong-bok-gung (Gung means palace), Chang-deok-gung was the most preferred palace of the king and his queens, chiefly for one reason- the SECRET GARDEN, which covers ~60% of the total palace area. While the palace itself can be entered with a ticket of KRW 3,000 and without a guide, the secret garden has a separate entrance within the palace (and ticket) and can only be accessed with a guide. Each guided tour lasts 90 minutes and tours are run in English and Korean languages (there might be other languages, but am sorry not sure about which ones, maybe Chinese & Japanese as well). The palace itself is open from 9AM to 5PM on all days (Mondays closed).Another important piece of advice- each tour has a cap of 100 joiners and while there are 3-4 English and 4 Korean tours every day (except Mondays) and they sell our pretty fast; apparently 50 passes per tour can also be booked online, though I haven’t tried it personally. So unless you are staying for a few days and want to try your luck, try booking the pass in advance. A palace-cum-garden ticket can be obtained at the main entrance for KRW 8,000.I actually missed the Sunday 3:30 PM (last English tour) and was almost disappointed until I came out and realised that there were 2 Korean tours available for 4 PM and 4:30 PM (ending at 5:30 and 6 PM, even though main gates shut at 5 for new entrants). As it was the last free day I had in Seoul I joined the Korean tour, which was the second best option. Really enjoyed the stunning beauty and grandeur of the secret garden, complete with small ponds with large umbrella-esque shelters for the royalty to sit by, waterfalls, and beautiful halls inside, not to mention flower beds and courtyards. And, the Korean guide realised that I had missed the English tour and was kind enough to summarise the brief to me after others had been informed and given time to click pictures.A must-do in Seoul, apart from Gyeong-bok-gung (for the Change of Guard ceremony at 10 AM & 2 PM daily except Tuesdays when it is closed)."
213,5.0,"Most beautiful, I liked this one the most! The Secret Garden inside the palace is worth of visit too, just reserve your tickets online week before, the amount of visitors is limited. But palace area is huge and beautiful"
214,4.0,"The highlight of Changdeokgung has got to be the Secret Garden, which must be visited with a guide and lasts 90 minutes with small breaks in between.The walk won't be easy for someone who has knee problems as it will have about 3 short but steep trails to hike. General palace admission including the Secret Garden costs ₩8,000 and it is closed on Mondays. Please make an online reservation for your tickets from their official website as it runs out fast."
215,5.0,Very nice palace with its traditional architectureBeautiful flowery garden around the palace. Entrance fee of 1000 Korean won
216,5.0,"Don't miss this one. It's not just another palace, it's the most beautiful one in Seoul. The buildings are incredibly charming. Make sure you book a tour for the adjacent secret garden (can't enter without a tour) as that will blow your mind -- it is gorgeous!"
217,4.0,"Nice place to walk around and enjoy history. Only costs ~$3 to get in, more for access to the secret garden. Unfortunately, I arrived around 4pm on a Sunday and the secret garden was already sold out for the day. So if you want to go, make sure to get there before mid-afternoon!"
218,4.0,"If it's a UNESCO site, it's always worth a visit. Changdeokgung lets you see how the palaces were in the olden times. A very historic place that has been kept fairly well. Not a lot of artifacts but the building structures and surrounding shrubbery make for a very nice walk in the afternoon."
219,4.0,"This Palace is similar (to my eyes!) but nicer than Gyeongbokgung. The buildings are really splendid and the gardens around very pleasant (blossoming these days with zillions of Korean teenagers in traditional costume spending the day to make selfies.....).Overall a similar sense of emptiness is nevertheless also present. These palaces are empty or closed... so despite thence architecture, it's like walking around something you'd like to (really) visit but can't. A bit frustrating. Nice place though."
220,4.0,"It's nice to walk around during the day time.Peaceful place which located in the centre of Seoul.Walking distance from Anguk subway station.Make sure join the free guided tour.To visit the secret garden, you have to buy another ticket, which they sell limited number of tickets available to access to certain time. 1.5 hour walking guided tour. Make sure you wear comfortable walking shoes due to you have to walk up the hill"
221,4.0,This very pretty palace looks like it is one of the best kept of the five royal palaces. Worth seeing and walking through.
222,4.0,"Our Viator guide was excellent. Wear comfortable shoes as there is a lot of walking. The ""changing of the guards"" is a bit hokey as there is no one to guard anymore but it is still something to see. The ingenuity of the Koreans to ""invent"" central heat was pretty neat. I can only imagine that the entire grounds will be covered in flowers within a few months."
223,5.0,"If you don't have enough time to go visit all the palaces you just need to do one- come visit the changdeokgung palace, especially the secret garden tour (guided tour only book separately). Had a great time here, the best among the palaces in Seoul."
224,5.0,"When I arrived at the site there was an hour left till the 1:30pm English tour. So to avoid the possible crowd I started to checkout the place and take photos. The size of palace is miniature compare to all others, which makes this one ideal as an 'introduction' or 'summary' of korea's nearest historical governance.My tour guide, Tian, knows the history well and is able to answer my questions about the palace, Korean history, and the emperor family. She was able to condense the tour to 30min for me to witness the guard exchange presentation at the gate by 2pm.Yes I recommend this place."
225,5.0,"This site is great for history and nature lovers. I highly recommend going on the guided tour of the gardens. Otherwise, you'll only see a fraction of what this palace has to offer."
226,5.0,The setting is beautiful with the gardens and trees. The palace is set according to the topography and is focused on harmony. So it wa out of the norm. Winter is a good time to go and you may see many young people in traditional clothing on a Sunday.
227,4.0,i went a few times over the year to this place for the night tour which happens in the autumn and spring months. its affordable and maybe the prettiest by night of all the palaces.
228,4.0,"I like this palace. There was a group of 15 tourists in the tour...guide was fine and eager to explain every details. God palace was huge and even with many tourists, one did not feel crowded. I loved the sights of many young Korean ladies dressed up their traditional attire to be photographed by friends...giggling and smiling...very nice. I recommend the place for a slow stroll!"
229,4.0,"This was my first Palace visit in Seoul. I bought the combined toicket for all palaces and the Secret Garden for 10,000 KRW. Had a guidded tour in English of the Palace (aprox. 45 minutes) and another tour of the Secret Garden (aprox. 1h30 ). Tours are free, guides were very interesting, just be sure to be there for the English Tour (there are a couple a day only). The venue is not as crowded as Gyongbokgung Palace."
230,5.0,The palace is well preserved and there are free tours to guide you round. It is just a short distance from train station. There is a palace guard changing ceremony here and you can check from the net on the ceremony time. Those who watch alot of korean drama should at least visit this place for once!
231,5.0,"it was great to know some of the history of south korea, greet place, all tourist like to visit it, i suggest to take a tour operator to save time, it was like a dream"
232,5.0,"Abolutely wonderful! This Palace is also called "" The East Palace"" according with its  location with the Gyeongbokung Palace. One of the 5 Main palaces in Seoul, the different pavillions have been restored after several fires , but they say, very similar as they were before, and have very colorful decorations. I recalled  one in particular, with its roof with beautiful Blue tiles..... splendorous! And the paintings in the Hall of the throne...: amazing!  At the end of March, the Cherry trees were NOT yet in full bloom, only a few of them, son I would recommend you to visit this outstanding site in the first or second week of April. ( I was a little  mixed  up and thought this Palace had the changing of the guard, but is NOT in this one , but in the Gyeongbukung Palace).  Highly recommended attraction for everyone!"
233,4.0,Beautiful place. Historic palace in Seoul. Rich in history. Many different buildings many of which were hand painted beautifully made.. Definitely worth checking out while in Seoul.
234,5.0,"Even though Gyeongbokgung get's recommended as the best palace most of the time, I prefer Changdeokgung with it's unique tour through the palace garden (also called ""Secret Garden""). I think I finally managed to see the garden in all 4 seasons and all of them have their own charms."
235,4.0,Easy to access and move  around. Not as vast as other palaces. Take a guide to gain insights of the culture and to understand historical impact of  eras.
236,5.0,"We visited the Changdeokgung Palace during the Spring.It was beautiful.The gardens surrounding this palace are vast and worth visiting as well, so bring good walking shoes.Make sure to buy tickets before you are planning on entering the premises - there might be a wait, especially if you are planning on joining the guided tour, which I highly recommend.Tickets can be bought onsite in a small ticket booth."
237,4.0,"A beautiful palace close to Anguk station with expansive gardens. Please note that you cannot walk around the secret garden alone and have to visit as part of a tour - English tours can fill up quite quickly so I recommend you go and confirm your time slot, then if you have time to wait you can visit the palace grounds or nearby attractions such as Gyeongbokgung or the Bukchon Hanok village"
238,4.0,"The palace grounds and buildings are very beautiful. There's a lot of walking involved. In the rear of the palace on the north side is the garden area or Biwon. You have to buy a separate ticket or pay for both palace grounds and biwon together. The garden was really interesting and beautiful but understand you'll be walking uphill a lot and can only go during a tour. They don't allow people to wander around by themselves. I dislike tours groups but there was nothing I could do. If you have a lot of time to sightsee around Seoul,  try all the palaces. If your time is limited, pick either this one or gyeongbukgung (which is a few blocks away)...it's not worth cramming both into one trip to Seoul. IMO, I would pick gyeongbukgung since you also have the option of visiting 2 museums on the palace grounds as well as lockers to stash your bags. Also #5 line lets you out right under the entrance."
239,5.0,"Beauty enriched by time. Walking through the palace grounds gives the visitor a sense of ancient Korea especially if you are a fan of Korean period dramas. The entrance is a massive gate adorned with colourful patterns and carvings on wood. Ticket is very reasonable especially if you buy the combination ticket for the five grand palaces of Seoul. This ticket includes the secret garden in this palace as well which I recommend you to see but once you reach the pavilion with the pond where the souvenir shop is you may stop there because the rest will be a long walk with tree lined uphill path and some more pavilion, nothing else. The Injeongjeon Hall is the throne hall of the palace. There are also small buildings which good picture backgrounds with less people like the Huijeongdang Hall. A map of the palace is essential."
240,5.0,"I came across this palace while trying to locate cheongyecheon. Just a short distance from train station. There is a palace guard changing ceremony here and you can check from the net on the time. We can also try the joseon era clothing here for free and take pictures with the palace guards. But pls, do not intimidate the guards, they are humans too."
241,4.0,"Stunning architecture. English tours available at 1030 and 1430 daily. Adjoins the Changgeongung Palace, which requires a separate ticket to be bought.  Note that the Secret Garden, which forms 60% of the palace grounds, closes at 3pm, so plan to arrive much earlier to allow plenty of time to explore. Also if you plan to rent an audio-guide, you are required to leave a passport or photo ID."
242,4.0,A beautiful palace in Seoul. It is open all year round for tours. I highly recommend visiting the site in Spring or Summer and taking the Secret Garden guided tour (check times and languages ahead of time!). It was nice in winter but would obviously be orders of magnitude better in summer.
243,4.0,"A bit smaller than Gyeongbokgung Palace, but still beautiful and impressive. Less tourists for those who enjoy silence."
244,3.0,"There are better places in Seoul (like the Buddhist temple in Gangnam). The palace itself looks nice but it's empty and ""new"". If you've been in China and Japan you will find this place worthless."
245,5.0,"This is a smaller palace than Gyeongbokgung Palace. The grounds are full of trees and gardens. It's a very peaceful location with surprises through every door. Like Gyeongbokgung Palace, don't try and do this without a guide. The history is amazing. Unfortunately I didn't have the time (or the energy) to visit the Secret Garden which takes another 1.5 tour. Next time for sure."
246,5.0,"The natural landscape of the Secret Garden was AWWMAZINGGG and beyond words, great place to go when its spring or autumn/winter when the flowers are blooming/falling. This is a guided tour and is an additional purchase of tix apart from the normal entrance fee. Since it is a guided tour, do take note of the schedule of the tour so that you can maximise your time whilst at Changdeokgung Palace!"
247,5.0,this time i went in to themuseum and looked on the history of the dynasti that ruled korea before. made also  some nice stamps on postcard so i cand send later to  friends
248,3.0,"Well that all depends on your level of travel experience. If you are a young traveler (I mean traveled to only a few countries), you will find this Changdeokgung Palace a great place.However, if you have already been to China and Japan, then you will most likely appreciate the place, without any amazement or excitement.Nevertheless, it's a clean, spacious and well maintained. Excellent.Worth a visit, if you like these styles of buildings / palaces."
249,3.0,"This Palace is a replica of the original. I found it quite interesting but wasn't bowled over as the buildings are fairly recent. It does give you a glimpse of what the originals looked like I guess. The gardens cost extra to view, I did not pay."
250,2.0,"The most original of Korea's UNESCO heritage temples, but still 70% was rebuilt after the Japanese destroyed it during its occupation. Everything looks new and all buildings are completely empty. I had an excellent English-speaking guide, but I would've liked to roam the beautiful ""secret"" garden by myself. Unfortunately that was not allowed.Only if you've never seen the palaces of Japan and Chine I'd recommend a visit to a Korean palace."
251,4.0,"Just a word of caution:  The tour is physically challenging and, at times, arduous (with some steep climbs and descents, frequently on uneven ground and/or stones).  Unless you are in good physical and aerobic shape, save yourself 5,000 won and give it a pass.The guide for my group had full command of English, was cool and laid back, was thorough yet concise and, most importantly, went at a fairly leisurely pace.  This allowed people to admire the sights, fall back a bit to photograph along the way and rest a bit, as the tour is physically demanding.  [If anyone affiliated with the Imperial Household Agency in Kyoto reads this:  You might want to take this tour to see how you should be conducting yours... seriously].The walk is pleasant, the sights are pleasant.  I was a little disappointed that the structural highlight of the tour, Juhamnu Pavilion, was “view at a distance” only.  Additionally, I was a little surprised that the structures and grounds of many of the sights were not kept up as one would expect, given the garden’s significance.  One of the sights (I believe it was Seonhyangjae) was under complete renovation; while that was bad for us, it will be good for those who visit when it’s completed.The tour was vastly more valuable from a historical viewpoint than was from a visual standpoint.  A Japanese garden it was not.  I’m sure in the autumn it will be more visually compelling.  This is a subjective opinion but I’m very torn as to whether or not it paid for itself (obviously they have to pay the tour guides which adds to their cost though, so therein lies the bind).One thing the tour is, though, and that’s shady.  If it’s uncomfortably warm or hot, you might want to schedule the tour to coincide with the height of the mid-day sun (although the strenuousness of some of the climbs sort-of negates the inherent temperature differential)."
252,4.0,Is worth to pay a visit if you love site-seeing.Secret Garden with good view when  maple turn red. You may follow a translate tour if you want to
253,5.0,This is my favorite palace in Seoul. The secret garden is a must.  With the fall leaves it is beautiful. You have to take a guided tour but then you can walk on your own during or afterwards.
254,4.0,"I have visited Gyeongbokgung Palace during my first trip to Korea in 2012. I planned to visit Changdeokgung Palace but it suddenly started raining after my visit to Gyeongbokgung. On my second trip to Korea, this was the first palace I visited. Architecture and design-wise, the buildings were very similar to those in Gyeongbokgung. I mean, I didn't really expect them to be different. The layout is what's different and having the Secret Garden is a big plus. I personally did not partake in the Secret Garden tour for friends who have experienced it told me it took so long to finish the course and it can quite tiring. Perhaps, on my next visit I will do so. Nonetheless, this palace is a good place to visit."
255,4.0,Nice palace to visit. Loads of walking to do.. Very intricate rooftop designs for the inner palace and the rooms of the king and queen. If I remember correctly. A place that you can take nice photos of Korea. You could take a walk inside but no need to spend too much time for each visit of the sites.
256,4.0,easily accessible - main attraction is the changing of the guard - come early as hordes of people line up to see the 'show' ..... smaller complex with lovely gardens and a few buildings...
257,4.0,Went to the palace during the fall season and it's a lovely place to soak up with culture and explore the expansive grounds. Recommended for anyone who are interested in Korean history and culture!
258,5.0,"Check for the guided tour timings before going, if not you may waste your time. The tour takes one hour. Not the biggest, but nicely preserved complex, linked to a great story, history. Should you wish to visit the secret garden, you have to book in advance, on their website. Also a guided tour, around 100 people, walking up and down in the forest for 90 minutes. A few nice stops, however quite tiring. Avoid going on a rainy day, as it is very slippery."
259,5.0,"This palace is open everyday from 9am to 5/6pm and closed on Mondays. Guided tour of the secret garden was at 11:30pm, 1:30pm, and 2:30pm so be sure to plan your schedule well. The Secret Garden in the back is breath-takingKorean traditional palace, flowers and trees are very beautiful in autumn.Historical palace in the historical district within Seoul CityCatch the changing of the guard ceremonies!Inexpensive admission fee of 3,000 wonWorld heritage site by UNESCO"
260,3.0,The palance is a nice place to visit but I will not go back for a second time.  It is avearge comparing to the real palace I have been.  It is sad that all the history was distroy during the war.
261,5.0,"Been here for a day tour while on a business visit.Very conveniently located in city, 15 min walk from holiday inn.Weather was very pleasant.Opens after 9 am, so had to wait to go inside.Glad to see how they preserve such a ancient monument."
262,4.0,"The palace complex consists of several buildings, each with its own unique story and design. It is well worth a wander around and if you time your visit right and take a tour then the history is intriguing but good signposting in English and Korean mean you can learn something about the place guided or not. Each of the palaces of Seoul has its own character and this one for me is the most interesting. A great place to spend an hour wandering around."
263,5.0,"This palace has a slightly pricey 3,000 Won entrance fee, but it is worth it considering the historical journey one experience as I move from one courtyard to another."
264,5.0,"Didn't get to see much of the palace because of the Secret Garden tour, but beautiful grounds. Had an English-speaking guide who expalined a lot of the symbolism of the various places where we stopped. A lovely tour."
265,5.0,"As one of the 5 palaces from the Joseon Dynasty, this palace is a beautiful landmark. There are tours available in English, Korean, Japanese, and Chinese."
266,5.0,"Gyeonbokgung palace is quite beautiful, and even more than that, it spreads on a huge area and contains a lot of ""rooms"" as part of the palace. It's got a nice history behind, which makes it much more interesting, so try to get some info when you're heading there."
267,5.0,"Let me start by advising that the ""pay extra and have the ability to tour independently on Thursdays"" that you may find in the latest editions of guidebooks is dated and incorrect.  They discontinued that some time back.  You may still tour the grounds of the Palace without a guide but the Secret Garden is by 1 1/2 hr guided tour only.To fully absorb the entire complex (ie Changdeokgung, the Secret Garden, Changgyeonggung and Jongmyo) properly allow a full sightseeing day, unless you visit during the summer when it will stay light until evening.  Although they are usually lumped together, since they require separate entrance fees, I will address them separately.  This is solely for Changdeokgung.Like its competitor to the west, this palace is on a huge, sprawling piece of land.  Architecturally, it best reflects the Joseon Dynasty's sensibilities.  It is set amid, not on top of, its surroundings and landscaping.  It does not seek to overwhelm (as does Gyeongbokgung) but rather to consistently impress and inspire awe.  Take the 1 hour guided tour if you'd like, but then return, history in hand, and wander through its labyrinthine design.  As you move from west to east (assuming you use the entrance off of Yulongno, passing through Donghwamun Gate), you will eventually come upon the King and Queen’s private quarters.  Finally, there is the residence of the Crown Prince (farthest to the east as he is a symbol of the rising sun).The structures and grounds are very well maintained and there is a café across the way where you can cool off and relax before taking the Secret Garden tour next door.  You might want to get the garden tour times in advance and time your visit to the palace accordingly.Keep in mind that if you continue on to Changgyeonggung, when the grounds close, the path back to Changdeokgung closes and your only way out will be the gate to the extreme east... which is, logistically, in the middle of nowhere."
268,5.0,Another incredible palace in Seoul and also very very big. You will get a feel of different gardens and what the palace offered back then. I enjoyed my visit here and within the palace you will also find different sections where the locals back then used to practice their religion along with little villages.
269,4.0,"The palace in itself is very nice. The garden are said to be the best part of the visit. But beware, you need to pay an extra fee to visit the garden. Moreover, it comes with a guided tour. The ones in English are not frequent and departs at specific times. Last one at 4 pm if I remember well."
270,5.0,"Visited this site during Chuseok (Korean thanksgiving day), hence admission was free. The architecture of the palaces here are amazing. Can just imagine how magnificient this place is in the place. As this is a huge complex, you need to walk alot. Wear in comfortable shoes. A great place for phototaking and spending half a day here just soaking in the atmosephere and culture."
271,5.0,Preferred this to Gyeongbokgung actually as it was less crowded.  Secret Garden tour was very nice but be warned there is some climbing.  A lot to see so easy so spend most of a day here.
272,5.0,Every weekend I walk by this palace and gate. And each time it is wonderful.   And make sure you take in the grounds inside and out.   Bukchon is just around the corner and should not be missed.
273,4.0,The Secret Garden tour is really nice but be ready to go (a steep) uphill more than once. You don't feel like you're in the city because it's full of green and it looks hidden.
274,5.0,"I have spent 8 days in Seoul in September, and the Changdeokgung Palace was of my personal Highlights. Im into history and culture, so I visited 4 of the Palaces and Changdeokgung was my favourite. Yes, Gyeongbokgung is more impressive, but Changeokgung for me has more atmosphere. I visited on a hot sunny day, and in some parts of the Palace I was alone. It was great just to sit in the shade and enjoy the surroundings. I joined one of the guided tours to the Secret Garden and also quite enjoyed that. Its not really a Garden, but a Forest with some Pavillions, which could be a dissapointement if you are expecting a Garden like in the Forbidden City in Beijing. I really enjoyed the tour and the guide (sorry, cant remember her name) was lovely and gave a lot of information. The only (major) downside: the group was very big (100 people), which doesnt make for a relaxed stroll around a beautiful piece of nature."
275,4.0,"This palace is neat, you can take a look around yourself but it will be very plain. Take guide suitable with your language. Our guide speaks excellent English and explains clearly. Overall, the palace is quite so so. The highlight is the Secret Garden. You are obliged to be with tour guide inside the garden. It is very very spacious and tranquil, it doesn't feel like you are in the center of a crowded city. I went in summer and everything is green and beautiful. They say that autumn is the best time to visit since it will be more colorful.Bring your own umbrella maybe, because we got hindered for a while by the rain. The entrance fee is around krw 8000, I don't remember exactly since I bought the package for 4 palaces for krw 10.000. There is a souvenir shop + coffee shop near the entrance."
276,3.0,"I finally made it here in the afternoon. The temple itself is ok but the option to tour the secret garden makes it awsomeness. The garden is heavily shaded and enclosed in nature. Be aware that like with most tours, they kinda make stuff up to fill in the gaps."
277,4.0,I was there years before in winter.Cold but the view is good.You can see a lot of historical building there.
278,4.0,"A huge palace with more than 30 buildings that in it's hey day had 300 buildings. Well worth spending a few hours walking around! The beautiful ceilings of the gates and buildings still retain their vibrancy. Little figures on the roofs show how important it is, the more figures the more important. Did love the sign warning of wild animals! They mean squirrels. Enjoyable look into Korea's history."
279,4.0,"In my opinion, Deoksugung is the best, and Cahgdeokgung is the second. It has beautiful architecture style, and well preserved."
280,5.0,"I find the Changdeokgung Palace complex much more beautiful than Gyeongbokgung Palace, as the former has a lot of beautiful trees and ponds, and different types of buildings, giving visitors a sense of a living space. Gyeongbokgung Palace has just buildings."
281,4.0,"If you are only in Seoul a few days, it probably isn't necessary to hit all of the palaces. The architecture of the Chosun period is quite uniform, and there are plenty of other sites you can visit that will offer you some variety. This was my favorite of the ones I visited, however. It is huge and expansive and has some of the most photogenic corners. I went in the morning, when it wasn't so hot and I practically had the place to myself."
282,4.0,"It is worth doing a guided tour. They are included in admission price, and you get much more out of it"
283,4.0,"This was one of the stops on a tour I booked through the hotel; as part of a larger, ""Korean Cultural Insight"" tour. I wasn't sure what to expect,  however I was pleasantly surprised by this impressive restoration. The tour guide was certified and gave a good background on the history and culture of the palace. The only advice I can offer is to bring an umbrella, as I did get caught in some rain on the tour, which was largely outside."
284,5.0,"You come and pay for the entrance (very cheap) and get a free tour with it.Definitely take the tour, you'll learn lot's of fun facts and will have a great time!"
285,5.0,We visited this palace during our stsy. it gives an insight into korean architecture. nice place to learn about korean culture.
286,4.0,"The palace has various section and large area, imagine once you seen Korean traditional movie each scene will recall the moment here. If you visit with local guide, you will know and understand of each meaning hiding of each design, art and would answer you why! Is a good book to read in real place."
287,5.0,"I wouldn't call this a must see, but I must say that I really enjoyed it despite the biting cold. One thing I love about Seoul's historical attractions is that they include free English tours, you just have to make sure you have the times right and that you are on time. Unfortunately I missed the last secret garden tour, which is said the be the highlight. Nevertheless, I found the tour to be fun, interesting, and very informative. Really, don't miss the tour, it is 70% of the experience. I found it more interesting than the main palace, Gyeongbukgong, equally beautiful, and much less crowded."
288,4.0,"This is a typical Korean palace, which means a group of many halls with vast spaces in between. It becomes somewhat repetitive after a while, and you do not need a giuded tour to see everything, but do take a tour into the Secret Garden. The giudes speak English really well and are able to tell entertainign stories. The scenery and pavillions are beautifull! Make sure your shoes are comfortablembecause you will be walking up and down a lot on this tour."
289,4.0,"While the palace itself is somewhat repetitive after a few minutes, the secret garden tour isn't. Very beautiful scenery and excellent tour guides. For the palace itself I would suggest visiting the larger palace to the west."
290,5.0,"This palace summarizes the grandeur of the Korean culture at its best. Massive, spacious and busy. The palace is well preserved. Allow 2 hours to fully understand the extravagance of this place and its significance in the Korean culture."
291,5.0,"This palace is on the World Heritage List and deserves to be. If you only see one palace in Seoul, make sure it is Changdeokgung. This palace eschews the rigid, identical layout of the other palaces and has more character to it thanks to the lovely gardens and more of the rooms having furniture in them. I took the free English guided tour of the palace and learnt lots about how the palace was used and who lived there. The Secret Garden tour was also enjoyable, seeing all the little ponds and pavilions tucked away in the extensive, forested grounds that feel a world away from the modern city around you. I was disappointed by the other palaces of Seoul, but Changdeokdung is something special and a nice place to visit."
292,5.0,"Amazing mix of architecture from Korean to the Japanese occupation. I utilized the free English speaking tour guides. Got there and watched the changing of the Royal Guard, a very colourful performance. All in all a great tour"
293,5.0,"This palace is really impressive on its own, however its real attraction lies in the Secret Garden which can only be accessed by booking an inexpensive tour. Check the times for the English language one. The tour lasts over 90 minutes so bring water and sunscreen on a hot day. You can buy a combination ticket for all 5 palaces and the Secret Garden for 10000 won, great deal! It's valid for more than 30 days if I remember correctly. The Secret Garden is the World Heritage Site of this palace and really impressive."
294,4.0,"All the palaces seem similar, but the exception here is the secrete garden tour, which is a guided hike through a large, hilly, forested area around the palace.  It is not really what you would normally consider a garden at all.  But each garden area is very nicely done and has traditional buildings.  A guided tour must be purchased separately for the garden.The palace itself is good to quickly look around.  But nothing new if you have seen other palaces.  Look for tours with your preference if you want, but I don't think it is necessary to enjoy."
