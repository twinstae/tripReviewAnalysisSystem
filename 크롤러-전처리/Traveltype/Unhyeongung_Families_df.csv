Compared to the main palaces in Seoul , this place is actually not bad. 30 minutes visit duration would be enough . Besides it is free to enter this complex ."
1,4.0,Right in the middle of the city near the Anguk station. We were staying nearby and stop by to visit this quiet place before check in.
2,4.0,"As others have said, this site is pretty small; you can check out everything in just a little over .5 hr. While it pales compared to nearby Gyeongbukgung and Changdeokgung, it's still a pretty place to see, especially in the winter when the field is covered by snow. You can enter and look around freely. It open at 9am."

And there are mannequins and descriptions too in almost all of its rooms that perfectly describe the history of Unhyeonggung.When we went there, there was also a free Korean folk show and we got to witness the showcase of different traditional Korean dances. Really cool. =)Hanbok dresses are available too for rent if you want to roam the palace ground in traditional Korean clothing and have your pics taken."

But it's actually just beside anguk station exit 4. It's opposite the anguk area with lots of eateries. If you have time, have some lunch at the eateries, pop into this palace then take a walk down insadong during the afternoon. It's all very close (which we only discovered after several days in Seoul!)This palace has less visitors so you can really enjoy a slow quiet time there. There's also a small room with exhibition of the wares and clothing of the royal family before. Quite interesting and as there's less visitors you can really spend time and look close up. The down side is, it's mostly only in Korean! Rather worth a visit if you have time!"
