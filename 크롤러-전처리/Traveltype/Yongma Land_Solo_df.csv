0,5.0,"Nice to walk through the neighbourhood also! Cheap enough to get in, no time restrictions. Great for photography."
1,5.0,"This is a great and quirky little break away from the hustle and bustle of the city and perfect for unique photographs. The amusement park has no limits or boundaries so it's easy to get lost in exploring. A very cold spot on winter however as it's so high up so be sure to bring some hot packs! I found this spot in a music video of one of my favourite K-pop groups and decided to look into it more. Trains and subway transfers will get you to Yongma easily and from the station a taxi would only take about ten minutes, however it easily walked to as well."
2,4.0,"A failed theme park at a corner of a neighbourhood. The walk to the entrance could send chills down your spine.The premise is owned by a man. You will be charged 5,000KRW to enter. It has become a popular place for photoshoots. Just keep your voices down as there is a school very closeby.You can choose to take a taxi from Mangu Station. I chose to walk and observe the neighbourhood.Directions:.. Mangu Station Exit 1.. Walk straight, cross and observe the blue street signs.. Turn left at Yangmasan-Ro 115.. Keep walking. You will need to cross twice till you see Mangu-Ro 72.. Turn right and keep walking.. You will walk up a slope, pass by a temple.... Up the slope, turn left.. Yongma Land is up ahead on the right at the dead end"

Why did it close down? A bigger amusement park in a better location was constructed on July 12, 1989. That amusement park became known as Lotte World. While Yongma Land is in a very random area of Seoul, between Yongma Park and hiking trails, Lotte World was placed right next to Jamsil Station.Here's a little about Lotte World and its effect on Yongma Land. Two subway stations intersect each other at Jamsil Station (Lines 2 and 9) and the station itself is only a 10-minute stop from Gangnam Station. Lotte World is also half indoors and half outdoors, so it still attracts a lot of people regardless of the weather. Finally, Lotte World was placed inside a shopping complex along with Lotte Department Store. This made it a much better option than Yongma Land. Yongma Land's fan based dipped after the 1980s and never recovered after that hence it's closure.Today, the owner of Yongma Land keeps it open for a niche group of people: photographers, video producers, people into cosplay, or random amateur photographers like me that just like unique experiences. When you go there, you just have to pay W5,000 to make your way around this abandoned amusement park. Does it seem a bit creepy? It is a bit weird when you get here, but it's also very nostalgic. You can get a piece of 1970s and early 1980s Korea at this place. That's something that you can definitely take away from this place. What was my experience like? Well, I enjoyed checking it out. I walked from Manggu Station and it was a bit inconvenient trying to weave through the residential streets and finally finding Yongma Park. Then I had to start heading up a path just before seeing Yongma Land off to the right. A hiking trail was just behind it. Just trying to find this place was great for exercise, but on a humid day, I was sweating a lot. I can see why this place went out of business. The location is very bizarre, which just makes this place even more eerie. You can get interesting pictures here, but it's definitely only a one-time event for me.How to Get There: It's about a 15-minute walk from Manggu Station, but it might be easier just to take a taxi from the station. The taxi driver should know Yongma Land but if all else fails, here's the address that you can type into Naver Maps:118, Mangu-ro 70-gil, Jungnang-gu, Seoul 02180Cost: W5,000Phone Number: 010-9671-6104Estimated Time You Will Stay Here: 1-2 hours"
