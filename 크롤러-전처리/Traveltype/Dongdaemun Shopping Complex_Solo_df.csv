1,3.0,"End up here after visiting DDP in Seoul easy to reach by subway, multiple floors that make it feel like a macys but all are little independent shops, top floors plenty of restaurants and cafeterias, another floor with bowling and srcade the looked fun,  and a complete new concept for me was a comic book store were you can be on a bumper bed laying with you couple reading comics, the rest were clothes shops that didn't seems to have the best quality but they do have interesting stuff."
2,5.0,"My ultimate favourite place for buying all sorts of beautiful fabric, charms and notions other than Nippori Fabric Town in Tokyo.Most shops are open by 10+am and take orders for collection at 1pm or 5pm. Many shops accept minimal orders of 1 yard though others don't. You can find knits, fur, crepe, cotton, chiffon, broderie anglaise, lace organza... anything under the sun!Charms and jewellery parts are everywhere. Many shops stock similar designs and prices may differ by 100₩. Best place to buy earrings here as well as they are as cheap as 400₩ where at Apm Place/normal shops they are 16,000₩.Most stall keepers are friendly and helpful and understand simple English/Japanese/Chinese."
3,5.0,"Complex contains many shopping centres or malls which have cheap goods as well as authentic goods made in Korea. It is a shopping haven for those on a budget as you can get many good clothes , bags , whatever you need by bargaining the prices . Definitely a must go if you plan on getting souvenirs or trendy clothes at a cheap price !"
4,3.0,"This is the world's largest fabric and clothing material market. You can buy the latest fabrics in Korea. They also sell accessories, bedding and hanboks here. Many vendors selling similar products... so shop around and compare the price."
5,4.0,Good bargain at Dongdaemun Shopping Complex. The shops sells mostly clothing and accessories. Variety of goods with cheap price.
6,2.0,"I found most of the shops in dongdaemun shopping area to be very disappointing. They were either very expensive, severe lack of choice for men's clothing and very cold reception from staff. Overall experience has been pretty piss poor really. Only saving grace is it's close to the dongdaemun design Plaza which is a cool place to have a walk around."
7,3.0,"If you love Korean fashion, this is the place for you. However clothes can be slightly overpriced and at the wholesale market you may have to buy more than 2 pieces depending on what you're buying."
8,4.0,"Finally a mall that has a floor for men..and is cool! I'm moving to Guam, so the clothes here wouldn't do me any help. Although I wish I could buy some..for its awesome. I suggest to make sure to find something else to do around the area as well. It's cool and all but not that exciting alone"
9,3.0,"Some of the shops in Dongdaemun Shopping Complex are for wholesale (or in bulk), it might be cheaper to buy from stalks in the street because if you buy only little from Dongdaemun Shopping Complex, the shop keeper might not even want to sell little and they don't necessarily give cheap prices."
10,4.0,I really enjoyed looking around this larger than ever fashion market area. Picked up some great shoes and boots for little cost. You have to find the treasures though. I found that there were very few tourists. Surprising because there is something there for everybody.
11,3.0,its a wholesale market for laces and textile raw materials. i saw some beautiful material made in korea and lot of stuff made in other countries but a wholesale market for it
12,3.0,5 or 6 complex mall places in the same area. opening from 10 am until dawn 4 am.many storey many shops in 1 mall building; All clothes seem good copied quality But a bit desserted on the day i went (Monday night on rainy day) So i am not sure what happened if i buy one. Shop owner seem agressive and tend to sell the lost wanderer.Still bargain skill and language problem is an incident to walk out for me.
13,4.0,"Quite an unexpected find the other day - a massive fabric market.  Buttons, zips, fabrics and nick nacks that you possibly could need for making clothing.  There is a constant stream of vendors coming and going from the market, and most are carrying long bolts of cloth.  It is quite crowded and easy to get lost, but keep your bearings and look for the letters to distinguish one building from another."
14,3.0,"I like Lotte fashion mall (the last mall along the street if you start from Doota). It sells a lot more unique fashion clothing that are designed by the locals. Prices are not at the lowest range but they are reasonable, considering the quality is better too. Train service ends around 12am, so be sure to catch the last train otherwise it will be a pain getting home because all the taxis suddenly become touts and will not go by meter. They want to ridiculously exorbitant rates (50,000 won just to go apgujeong where my hotel is, which is like a 10-15mins ride! That's my taxi fare from incheon airport to apgujeong). Thank god the tourist information center nearby is still opened so I went there to find help. That's when the staff told me that there's a nightbus service N13 that goes to sinsa station, which is the closest to my destination (my hotel is in between sinsa and apgujeong). I had to walk a little bit from the station but better than paying 50,000 won! The nightbus cost just 2,000 won.If you are staying somewhere else, suggest you ask the staff in tourist center which nightbus service is heading towards the direction of your hotel, then drop off at the best bus-stop and grab a cab. Taxis at anywhere else goes by meter, it's just touristy places like Dongdaemun that have all these touts."
