The place itself is easy to find, accessible from metro. Using #2 metro stop at Hapjeong station and you can find the shrine on your left about 500m. Since it is a religious place, it's clean and quite. We can find St. Andrew Kim Tae Gon, korean first Catholic Priest and our Church's name in Jakarta."

When I go to museum, fee was 2000 won each, but I didn't have change, so I paid 10000 won without change because the form of fee was offering."
