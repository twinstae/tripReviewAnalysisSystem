1,5.0,Eat like a local and experience how regular people eat and live.  This area specializes in grilled fish of all types. Must visit!
2,5.0,"From Dongdaemun, we walked cross several small street and finally arrived one with many shops selling fried fish.  Though these shops are usually small and local in style, the fishes they fried were absolutely delicious.  We have to repeat our orders in order to compensate for the walk.  Definitely a good place to visit for fish lovers - the price is not expensive (good value for money)."
3,2.0,"Went there because of reviews indicating that the place was great. Fish was actually quite tasteless, and left out in the cold. The owner actually re-grilled the fish despite it being grilled multiple times and close to being charred. Cost for a fish was 10000 won. Not worth visiting."
4,5.0,"I found this place on my second stint in Seoul and absolutely loved it. Its small, cramped, a little dirty, but a must see for those seeking the ""authentic"" foodie experience. You can get any fish from the East Sea grilled up for next to nothing and they've got tons of it. The beer is cheep and your total bill will not exceed 15,000 won ($15 USD). if you have any extra time in Seoul, go here. I took every member of my family who visited, everyone of my co-workers, and several Koreans who'd never been and they all enjoyed the experience."
