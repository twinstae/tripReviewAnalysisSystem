0,4.0,"This is like an antique market having things in the past. Good to spend 1~2 hours.- They have various items like Dongdaemun Market or Namdaemun Market. The difference is things here are old. Clothes, fashion accessories, military stuffs, musical instruments, toys, electronics, handcrafts, tools, etc.- They also have cafes and restaurants. There were some free concerts at the entrance, too.- Sellers and visitors are mostly not young. Often encountered shops with absent sellers.- Cheap things are cheap. Rare or valuable things aren't cheap. You may be able to find something awesome.- Aisles are narrow. Some musty smells. Rusty stuffs. Recommended to locals who are fed up with well-known places. I'm not sure foreign tourists will like this place."

Many of the goods on sale were typical flea market things, military, new stuff, furniture, clothing etc so you really need to look carefully to find hidden treasures. Baseballs caps were piled up high on the ground and were selling for 1,000 Won each, many of them originals from baseball teams and the like. Bags were also piled up high all selling for 2,000 Won each. Old watches and watch parts were also housed in large plastic containers and boxes.We enjoyed the market but have definitely been to better such as those in Japan. However, we would happily visit this place again as it is pretty huge and stretches into many of the surrounding streets and alleys."

I recommend going one weekend, just to orient yourself with all the shops in the building and in the alleys.  Then, when you have an idea of where you want to shop, go on a 2d or 3d weekend, and do some in-depth shopping and bargaining.  Beware, there is some artwork that can some nudity if you have young children (it is avoidable if you are wary).  Finally, this is a great place to find some cheap Black Yak clothing."
