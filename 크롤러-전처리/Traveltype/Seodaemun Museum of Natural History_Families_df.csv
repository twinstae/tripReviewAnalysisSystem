0,5.0,"While visiting Seoul, my son kept asking to see dinosaur bones so we decided to check out the Seodaemun Museum of Natural History.  We arrived just after the museum opened at 9 and we were the only ones there.  The entrance fee for adults is 6,000 won and it’s free for kids under 5.  The museum was fairly standard for a natural history museum.  There was a section on dinosaurs, beautiful rocks, cool insect displays, live fish and insects, some stuffed animals, evolution, fossils, etc.  Overall, it’s a nice museum and good for a couple hour visit.  There is a cool looking slide outside, but it was raining while we were there so we didn’t use it.  While we were finishing up at the museum several school groups arrived.  I recommend getting there early in order to avoid the school groups.  There was a snack shop at the museum and also a small gift shop.  We got off at the Gajwa metro station and took a taxi from there.  It would be a bit of a ways to walk from the metro station plus there is a steep hill going up to the museum."

For the little one is no a problem because he enjoying mostly looking but the others are different.   The app for the mobile so good for kids!If yours kids likes Dinos is super fun. Very interesting the earth environment. You can spend about 2 hours and it's a very good price."

There were many animals, plants, and miniatures. But if you go there, you'll be not that easy to find there because it is in the middle of residential area. But if you go there, you'll be surprised. Because the miniatures are so full of life."
