0,3.0,"I decided to visit this park as it is near my hotel. For all its rich historical significance, it is also a nice, small park from which to take a breather and quiet walk in the heart of the city. During autumn, it is also a beautiful sight with the trees lined with yellow and red color leaves. Bear in mind though that its opening hours is only from 9am to 6pm."

8,4.0,"Not a top priority, however like the Seodaemun prison, to be done after everything else has been done; Your last day in Seoul, for instance. Nice place to sit down and have a rest or a sandwich."
9,3.0,A small park that is historically significant in that the Proclamation of Independence was announced here in 1919. Also within the park is a small pagoda built in the 16th century when the park was a Buddhist Temple.
10,3.0,"Tagpol Park is a city park in Jongno area not far from the Jongmyo Shrine.  Also referred to as Pagoda Park, this is an important historical location in Seoul with several interesting things to see. The park is open from 6am to 8pm daily. Here you can see the 15th century, Wongaksa Pagoda. This is a 10-storey marble structure and an important national treasure which is encased in a glass building and supported by scaffolding. It is similar to the Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda you can see at the National Museum of Korea. You will also find pavilion covering the historic Monument of Wongaksa, a tortoise with a pillar on its shell created in 1471.  There are a number of bas relief murals lining the inner wall of the park. These are images of Korean patriots and the proclamation of Independence, which was recited here at Tagpol Park during the important March 1st Movement in 1919. Other figures, sculptures and open park space can be found here at Tagpol Park, making this a nice add-on place to visit if you are planning spend time at the nearby UNESCO World Heritage site - Jongmyo Shrine. You can comfortably see the historical attractions here in 15-20 minutes and be on your way."
11,4.0,"Found this by chance ambling around close to Insa-dong.  The park contains an old pagoda built in the 15c. and a stone turtle (15c) in another part.  The site is also the birthplace of the independence movement to break free from Japanese control.  There is plenty of information in English so it is worth exploring.  On the Sunday morning we were there, there were people doing exercises in the park while others were chilling out in the sun."
12,3.0,"There is nothing much in this park aside from the interesting Wongaksa Pagoda and Monument of Wongaksa stele.  As a temple hunter, I enjoyed it, but it doesn't have a lot to occupy you for a long time.  Worth seeing if you are visiting Insa-dong"
13,2.0,"Some of the reviews here have made this park larger than it actually seems. It's very small, and apart from the old pagoda and murals, there's really nothing much else to see. We were here just to get the bus to Nami Island (the stop faces the Starbucks cafe across the street). For those here because they are thinking about how to get to Nami, I would recommend asking your hotels to make advance reservations with the official Nami Island operator. We did so with The Westin, who assured that we had seats for the trip. Many others came and joined the queue to try their luck, but from what I saw a good 70-80% of the seats were pre-reserved, leaving many others without a ticket."
14,4.0,Not a must-see but if you are in the area it is definitely worth a visit. This pagoda is one of the oldest in Korea and is very well preserved. There isn't a lot else to see in the park but if you are nearby it is quiet place to relax and see a little history.
