TIP (For the bookish) : After or before visiting the Statue, make the most of your time in the location and visit the Kyobo (underground) bookstore."

We can find under the pedestal a small Museum . Sejong looks at the fine arts Museum, named in his honor. Kings were rarely discovered various talents, often ruled without them. Sejong is the exception. He was artistically gifted, which was highly prized in Korea and China. Most importantly, of course, that he was a talented statesman. His political successes were based on public administration reform. He brought to Korea Chinese officials, who were recruited not on the hereditary principle, and abilities. New Korean bureaucracy guided by Confucian ethics, have achieved victory over the Japanese pirates and normalized relations with both Japan and China. That's what the Koreans established king Sejong at the main square, and on the banknote of 10,000 won in addition."
