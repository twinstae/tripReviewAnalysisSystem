0,5.0,A bit far from Center seoul. But it offers many shops selections and korean brands. Reasonable prices as well.
1,4.0,"COEX is a huge underground mall, ideal for a whole day excursion. It had hundreds of restaurants and shops, as well as an elaborate movie theater, a library, and an aquarium. We recommend COEX for folks living abroad in South Korea or people on long vacations, but it isn't something you need to see if you're passing through. It's next door to a lovely Buddhist temple. Be prepared to pay a little higher prices than elsewhere in Korea - it is a mall, and it's in the heart of Gangnam. It is the nicest underground mall we've ever been to, though!"
2,4.0,This convention center is huge and you could easily get lost if you are not careful. The food and shops can be pretty pricey though so be prepared to spend a little more if you intend to eat/shop while you are there.

4,3.0,"Coex has been renovated a few years ago and now I have mixed feelings. In the past, it was way easier to navigate around and shop while avoiding the hot or cold weather outside. I like how it is much cleaner and modern but the layout is much more confusing than it used to be. The first time I visited after renovation, I couldn't find my friend because it was like a maze! We stayed for a bit to look around and when it was time to pick a place to dine...we gave up and just left to go somewhere else. There were many options but we got exhausted from walking around. They have cool shops and it is a great place to hang out but I guess you would really have to know how to get around. I'm planning to visit again so we'll see if I get lost this time. LOL"
