0,3.0,Are the floor tickets there good? Is there enough space for people to stand and see the stage or is it cramped ? Am hoping to attend a Queen concert in 2020 and was wondering
1,4.0,"Differences between baseball games at Angel Stadium in Anaheim, CA vs here: Food is much cheaper, but there are no vendors selling at your seat. A box of about 25 meaty chicken nuggets was about $10 and fed 3 of us. Water bottles were only $1, beer only $3. Cheap seats were $13. Only 1 merchandise location outside the stadium so shop before or after the game. No 7th inning stretch or kiss cam, but they had cheerleaders and contests, and even an American player on the winning team. No rap music to suffer through, but fans know their chants and fully support their teams. there are restrictions as to the size of bag you can bring in and types of bottles, so check the website before you go. We entered with ticketless entry on our friendâ€™s phone. Easy to get there by train and beautiful area."
