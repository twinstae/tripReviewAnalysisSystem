Coming to the place , it’s quite fun if you like taking pictures , it’s not that big , but bigger than few others I have seen in Europe . Ice museum is not bad either.I visited at 9:30 on a Saturday morning g and there was literally nobody in the museum , may be it’s the lunar new year or I was lucky ! As I was alone , I couldn’t get any picture of myself ! Nevertheless it’s fun"
1,5.0,"I had a fun time here, it is highly recommended to anyone visiting Seoul. Everyone would have a guarantee unique and satisfying experience.  Two thumbs up."
2,5.0,I have truely enjoyed my visit here. The staffs were welcoming and atmosphere was fun. Next year's round 2. Thank you trick eye.
3,1.0,Do not visit this museum when you are alone. You just loose your money. People working there are extremely unfriendly and not helpfull at all. They refuse to rake even a single picture for you. I payed a lot of money just to be there alone. It has absolutely no meaning visiting this museum if you cant have pictures. I left after the first room. I lost a lot of money for nothing. This museum should get rid of the present people “working” there and start over with a staff that enjoys working with people. Really my worst experience in 3 weeks South Korea!!!
4,5.0,is a fun place to visit for everyone~ strongly recommend to download the camera apps to capture photo or video
5,4.0,"Using 3D augmented application, photos and videos get interesting and live. Fun place if you go with someone together. With one ticket you can visit both Trick eye museum and Ice museum, and it is worthy enough for 15k won. Ice museum was pretty cool, but make sure you have warm clothes in hand. 26 degree outside, -2 degree inside."
6,4.0,"Well, it's fun and all but there isn't much to do in there. You'd literally be done exploring in 15 minutes. I'm being charitable with my review just because I loved their interactive 3D app. Ice museum was boring though..."
7,5.0,Many photos has been taken and it was fun in the museum. And using the app to see the trickeye picture is a fresh experience in 4D museum. I 'wow' many times while using the app to see picture. Also there is new comer that has a supermoon for people to take photo. it is beautiful too.I recommend to go with friends rather than solo because one person can't take many pictures and always ask help from others.
8,5.0,"I have been to several museums of this kind, but what made this one special was a dedicated app that made the art move or added some elements to the picture. Take someone along so you can take pictures of each other. The entry costs 15,000 won and includes the tiny Ice Museum on the same floor. And while you are here, make sure to go to Love Museum upstairs too!"
9,3.0,"So, I went here alone as I was in the neighbourhood shopping and didn’t want to drag my coworker along with me while I browsed 100 beauty stores. I quickly realized that was a big mistake as 98% of this attraction is basically posing with different scenes and taking photos through the museum’s app to create an “optical illusion”. This was quite awkward being alone as I didn’t have anybody to take my photo, not to mention the scenes are quirky and people really get into it (lay on the floor etc.). I’m honestly the kind of person to stand beside a landmark and smile (with a bad fake smile and awkward hands) so all in all not really my cup of tea. But if you enjoy that sort of thing, check this place out! The sample photos were pretty cute. I liked the mirror maze at the end, and the ice museum was a cute (albeit short) experience. This is what I wished I knew before going, so I hope it helps you make your decision!"
10,3.0,"It's quite okay, but I think the place is kind of over priced just for you to take unique and 3D photos. But if you're the type who love to have tons of photo updates in your social media, then you might love the visit to this place."
11,4.0,I went here and it was nice. There are many different attractions to see and do. Go here for some photos and fun time with your family and friends.
12,5.0,"It's interesting and I enjoyed my visit there. It's really only for photo taking so if you're not a fan of having photos taken, then don't go, as it's not much fun only looking. I went on my own and I was lucky visitors there were happy to take a photo of me when I asked them. There will be a lady who tells you to sit for oil painting photo free trial. However as with everything what's for free, this isn't for free. You will only see the oil painted photo for free, the print outs must be paid then of course. But overall an interesting experience. Make sure you download their app prior to the visit - it's even more fun :) Someone mentioned here the love museum entry is included in the Trickeye Museum ticket. It's not. You need to pay separately for both museums despite they're in the same building only on different floors."
13,3.0,"It is a nice place to visit especially if it's too cold to do something outdoors. It's pricey (much more expensive than the pass to see all palaces) and you must bring your own smartphone to ""see"" the CGI on the screen. Internet connection is sometimes slow, so you must wait some time to download the illusions to the smartphone. I think this place is more targeted for children."
14,5.0,"Great place in a wonderful location, you can take your friends and family for a visit out with great time and amassing pictures"
15,3.0,"About 14 USD for the Trick Eye and Ice Museums. Fair price for me is about 7 or 8 USD which is the price for a movie in a theater in Korea. This is very good for kids... and that's all. Not that special. I don't know why it has good review rate. In the ice museum, it's so cold. If you are sensitive to the coldness, it is not good idea to go inside. And the art work made of ice... I don't know it's worthy... seeing... It's very for the kids... not for adults.....트릭아이와 아이스 두 곳 방문하고 1만5천원인데, 영화 한편을 2시간 감상하는 것(8천원 정도)과 비교한다면 난 '영화'를 선택하겠다. 그리고 이 박물관의 가격은 7~8천원 정도가 적당하다고 본다.원래는 트릭아이 미술관이었던 모양이네... 이제 돈독이 오른 거냐... 홍대 주변 건물값 상승과도 관련되어 있겠지만....착시 효과를 일으킬 만한 작품들이 많이 있긴 하지만, 이게 정말 신기하거나 흥분을 불러일으킬만하지는 않다. 이런 작품 한두개는 이미 경험한 사람들이 대부분일 것이다.이건 결국 가격이라는 견론에 도달한다. 너무 비싸다. 아무리 봐도 7~8천이 적당해보인다.그리고 아이스 뮤지엄은 정말 춥다. 냉동고에 들어가는 느낌 그대로다. 여기 유지하는 유지 관리비(전기)가 정말 많이 나올 것 같더라. 뭐 굳이 가격이 비싸다면 이것때문이 아닐까? 그러나 그 정도로 아이스 박물관이 볼만한 가치가 있다고는 말 못하겠다. 얼음으로 만든 조각품 감상 정도다...."
16,4.0,"I found out about this place while trying to think of something to do to kill time before my flight home. I'm glad I found it, as it was quite amusing. However, I wasn't able to embrace the experience fully as I had no company with me to take those tricky pics. hahaha. If you download the TrickEyee app, you can use it to see some animations for several of the artwork. It's definitely worth going a next time with friends or family. Also, brace yourself for the Ice room."
17,4.0,"Great place for Pictures and fin with your friends, small place it will take you 20 min but it is worth it, make sure to go with your phone and friends to take los off vídeos más Pictures."
18,4.0,Came across this museum hoping it was more 3D and optical illusions but it’s more of a staged photo background. Granted the resulting photos are really neat it’s not for the selfie. The effect is lost. It’s fun to pose with friends da and family and laugh at the resulting photos. 15000w gets you in the TrickEye and the Ice museum which are cute ice sculptures in a freezer. It was fun to visit but bring a friend so they can take pictures of you.
19,5.0,"Interesting to visit place for families and couple/groups. I was there by myself and had no problem to enjoy the place. THE NEW VR section was a most amazing for me. Literarily tried out every attraction. If you are in Korea, In Seoul and around hongde the this place is must."
20,5.0,"I am glad I took some time out to visit this museum. Amongst the three museums located in the same place, Trickeye Museum is my favorite. What really surprised me was that the when you look at the art with a naked eye or with any camera, they look just like any normal beautiful painting but when you use the Trickeye App Camera, they come to life. I will definitely recommend my colleagues to visit Trickeye Museum"
21,4.0,Hongdae is a famous shopping street. There is Trick Eye Museum here. Especially love room is only for adults. It is very interesting.
22,5.0,"It's the 1st Trick Eye/ 3D Museum that has AR Technology to make you feel more fun when you are watching & posing with a lot of nice 3D pictures. It's better for you to download the App ""Trickeye"" in your mobile phone in advance. (If you did not, they also provide free WiFi for you.) Do not forget to charge your battery full and bring additional power bank along with you."
23,5.0,"This museum is one of my favorites! The museum is an interactive one, so you need to pose and get the right angles for the illusions to work! There is a lot of illusions to choose from, so anyone should be able to find an illusion to take a picture on. There is also a small ice museum across from the front desk, but it's nothing special."
24,3.0,"It's a cool museum, but pointless to go by yourself, cause the selfies are extremely difficult to get, you can't even take selfies with a majority of the scenes. You kinda have to have someone with you to take the cool pictures."
25,5.0,This place does exactly what it says on the tin and is the perfect attraction for selfie-lovers - although do go with a friend who can help you take those pictures and do remember to download the app to see your selfies come to life in sometimes quite amazing way!
26,4.0,"The trickeye museum was a lot of fun but it's difficult to enjoy as a solo traveller. It gets tiring having to ask strangers to take photos for you (and more often than not, having those photos come out poorly). I would recommend that they maybe have staff throughout the museum that can take pictures for visitors."
27,4.0,It is a fantastic place. If you wanna be child again you shoul go there. Don't forget your camera or clean your phone memory cuz you will take hundreds of picture :) Have good time from now...
28,4.0,Interesring place with trick eye and love museum. Good for a short fun time and getting some memory snaps of Seoul )
29,3.0,"This place has an entrance fee of 15,000won? or 20,000 won? I forgot... probably the first one. It will give you access to their Trickeye 3D museum and their small Ice museum. I found this place to be just a place to kill time. If you're a solo traveler, this wouldn't be good as you won't be able to take a picture of yourself hahaI enjoyed a stall's VR zone. It is 5,000 won a pop."
30,3.0,"Mostly for photo-lovers, you can made interesting shots with all this ""3D"" stuff and some of them look really pretty."
31,2.0,"Not a museum. An indoor carnival attraction to take posed silly pictures in. Maybe fun for teenagers and preteen and the instagram obsessed selfie taking crowd. Really just a bunch of perspective paintings and props. ""Ice museum"" included in the price even more lame- the highlight is a toilet made out of ice with a plastic turd in it.  Hard to imagine why this place gets a ""trip advisor top 10 places to must visit in Seoul. Skip it unless you have a rainy day in town with the kids."
32,5.0,Like everyone elae already wrote it is definitly a museum to visit. It is a museum with just 1 goal: make you laugh!
33,4.0,"This place is unlike any museum I've ever seen. It gets top marks for uniqueness alone. The best to describe it: it's just a whole lot of pictures on walls that you actually enter and become part of, and then have your photo taken as if you're part of the art! Well worth the entry fee, which from memory is only about 10,000 won.It's not easy to take photos by yourself or without a selfie stick, so take someone with you so they take take your photo while you pose.The ice museum is also part of the entry free which is quite fun for photos too, and the ice slide is worth a go as well."
34,4.0,"The trickeye museum is worth a visit and have some very interesting things inside. But I recommend to take a friend or not go alone as I did as u need someone to take a photo of u or someone. It's a 2min walk up a busy Street where cars cannot go. A little hard to find but worth it. It's fun, the love museum is above"
35,5.0,I had the opportunity to visit the Trickeye Museum my last day in Seoul and I am so glad I didn't miss it.  We laughed and laughed until our faces hurt while taking pictures.  I would suggest to go with another person for this museum.  I was on a solo trip so I was going to skip it but I was fortunate enough to meet a great friend and we went together.
36,4.0,Trickeye puts you inside unbelievable settings from classical paintings to fantasy locations. Set after set gives you lots of photo ops. Everyone likes posing and then instantly seeing the pics.
37,4.0,Visitors are able to express their imagination by being a photographer taking the most creative photographs or become an object of a realistic masterpiece.
38,4.0,"It's not usually my thing to pose in this quirky kind of way, but it is pretty cool and I had a lot of fun doing it! If you're in the right company it will definitely enhance your experience."
39,5.0,"Went to the museum alone and initially it was difficult to experience the museum without people taking photos of you as that is the main point. Luckily managed to find some people to go together with, which helped a lot.The images are very innovative and it was great fun!"
40,5.0,"Do you need a fun activity to keep the kids occupied, or are you looking for a fun thing to do with friends? The Trickeye museum is a great place to do both. The museum has many interactive pieces that allow you to interact with art and become a part of it."
41,3.0,"Busy on weekends, but nice in the summer since theres an Ice Museum component. Its a fun alternative to historical sights in Seoul.  I think it costs about $15 and took about an hour or so to go through!"
42,2.0,"It was not an enjoyable experience as they were changing the props when I went there, and the staff did not remind me that they are changing the setting, which makes me feel not worthwhile to pay for the entrance fee but didn't see much well-set props."
43,5.0,"I love quirky place like this!  It was a lot of fun, but you better bring a partner or make it an entourage because it’s no fun alone. No one to take your pictures!  There is also a small ice room, with a “house” furniture and even a slide you can slide on made entirely off ice.  In the foyer there is a hanbok (traditional Korean wear) picture studio, coffee and ice cream shops."
44,5.0,amazing and funny. trickeye museum have open in several place and easy to go. check from the visit seoul website can get.
45,5.0,fun place. this place is god for the traveller who need use half day. 2 hour is enough. delicious drink they sold is good!
46,5.0,"The Trickeye Museum is hilarious. The museum is filled with optical illusion backgrounds with which you can make the funniest pictures. Actually that's the whole point: taking pictures of each other and having fun with your friend(s) in the decor.That means that it is no fun to go there alone, unless you have a selfiestick to make pics with. And even then, it is way better, easier and more fun to be with 2 people (or more). It was very crowded inside the museum, so you have to wait for a time-window in which there is no-one in the illusion and be quick to snap your snaps, if you understand what I mean.I wrote all about it on my blog, with a lot of fun pics too. Check it out here:http://curlytraveller.com/2014/02/trick-eye-museum-seoul.html"
47,5.0,"Too so many pictures.Had so much fun taking all the pictures there. Some pictures will need some rotating and creativity to make them look good.Ticket is 15,000 Won and inclusive of the Ice Museum in the same building, same floor.Provide about 2 hours here.There is also a Love Museum on the floor above it. Looks interesting but didn't enter."
48,5.0,Really enjoyed being in this museum & I'm amazed at the artistry of the picture walls creating an illusion when caught on camera.It was also bonus that the colorful ice museum was already added to the attraction..
49,5.0,"Love it and loved it. It keeps changing and they continue to add more and more things to see and do, which makes it more exciting.the most important tip, since you'll take so many photos this day, is to dress nice. i'm sure youll be using these photos on ur fb or whatsapp or kakao, ALOT."
50,4.0,I honestly thought it would be bigger for the price we pay to get inside.... I mean you can take pics on it for 30 min tops. You'll end up deciding if yes or no. The pics are very original tho. It makes you laugh.
51,5.0,I really love to take photos here...it's suitable for kids & teens too...really have fun taking photos in this place. Thumbs up for Trick eye Museum!
52,4.0,"If you've been wanting amazing photos to show off on your instagram or FB, then this place is for you. It has lots of 2D photo tricks that will look awesome to the naked eye or the lens. I visited the trickeye museum on my last day in seoul so I was in a bit of hurry so I selected the frames that I really liked. I should definitely have stayed longer. It is located at the heart of Hongdae along with the love museum and ice museum. The place has a 15,000 entrance fee, by the way, so it's not that cheap. Perfect for friends and couples."
53,3.0,"it was very cool place to visit, the museum located underground and its a bit hard to find, because there's just small sign ( i've visited trickeye museum at hongdae).i suggested to come to this place with your friend , i was come here alone and i couldn't take a good photos, what a waste .."
54,4.0,"My first experience at this place was pretty good. But I will admit that its not very fun if you are there by yourself and trying to find someone to take a picture for you. I HIGHLY recommend however to go there with your friends and family if you like, but I do warn you that its not really a good place for young children under 12 years old since some of the pictures are a bit ""questionable"" to responsible parents, but if you are there with your buddies or spouse, or girl/boyfriend, then by all means, go there! Its a really fun place to go and take crazy pictures and upload em up on Facebook or any viral web sharing site your hearts desires. Sometimes this place has an interesting exhibits or so, but the admission at this place is VERY pricey and expensive. Sometimes, it can be a bit overcrowded on the weekends, So, I recommend, that you go there on a weekday or something and its nice, but only good to go once, unless you like to repose yourself again on certain crazy paintings."
