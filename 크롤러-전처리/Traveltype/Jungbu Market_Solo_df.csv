1,3.0,"I had worked in the area for over 12 years and had walked by the market on Euljiro many, many times.  Back for a visit i decided to walk thru the market, it was interesting...but I had to find my way out after about 10-15 minutes.  The dried fish creates dust with a strong odor.  It played havoc with my nose, and after leaving the odor stayed with me for hours.  Sadly, I will never go back.  It is an interesting place for sure but if you have a sensitive nose, be cautious.  There are other wonderful markets in Seoul to visit, Namdaemun, Insadong, and Noryongjin Fish market for example."
2,4.0,"In my opinion you can't beat a local market when travelling abroad for a true cultural experience and ""Chungbu Market"" (some say Jungbu) doesn't disappoint.  There are hundreds of market stalls selling all sorts of produce, but I find the 'fish' produce the most interesting, even though you have to cope with the fishy smells that go with it.Some great photo opportunities and the market traders seemed very friendly.  I went early on a Saturday morning (8:30am) and it was perfect as the stalls were all freshly laid out and heaped with interesting things to see and photograph.  Just a 2 minute walk from Exit 6 or 7 of Euljiro4-ga Subway Station on Green Line 2.  Well worth a visit, as long as you like dried fish!"
