0,5.0,"This is the commercial tourist district of Seoul in the shadows of Gyeongbokgung  Palace. This district is full with shops and restaurants for visitors. Some are the most trendy trinkets but some are all treasures of Korean culture. All of it can be found in this street and district. Plus, this is Korea so there are all kinds of Comic statues for you to pose with. The Koreans thought I did a perfect job of mimicking there running man statue down to my blue coat. However, we were also introduced to the candy making art of dragon beard.  It is delicious and they make it right in front of you on the street if you are in Seoul, take the time to visit."

Never updated and then you reach a brand new centre with great coffee shops and a great shopping/play area for kids!This is a must to feel you are in Korea. Once walking through Insadong you reach the Palace."

8,4.0,"Insadong is an alternative place to go to if you find Myeongdong too crowded. Unlike Myeongdong, you will not find the typical shopping items like sports wear and cosmetics but instead, it is easier to browse around and you can buy souvenirs that are uniquely handcrafted. Along the smaller side streets, there are quite a number of traditional Korean restaurants that serves good Korean dishes and also the quiet and peaceful Hanok Tea Houses where you can relax and sip on a good cup of traditional korean tea with snacks."

An embroidery store. A shop where an artisan made spinning objects of wood. During one visit there was an outdoor performance highlighting some aspect of Korean heritage, but because there was no English explanation I can't provide one either. I received the scarf below as a gift from family. A great way to spend an afternoon and purchase souvenirs."
11,5.0,"Unlike the mega-city feel and architecture of the rest of Seoul, the Insadong area includes an open compound of very low buildings which comes to life at sunset, similar to Taipei's night markets but chic.It includes many diverse restaurants, patiseries and fashion shops at a very wide price range, carefully designed to have a chic look and uniqueness to each, which contribute to the general great vibe of the place. In the wider streets you can find cosmetic stores and restaurants open until late. There are also great AR/VR places (highly recommended experience, as they are cheap and lots of fun).You will meet there eople from all walks of life coming after a rough day at school or at work to eat and enjoy together, and also especially many young people dressed by latest K-pop and japanese inspired fashion."
12,5.0,"We enjoyed a nice stroll here. The art galleries and handicraft shops were definitely worth a visit. And the cafes here... each one offers a unique experience, but the most memorable for us was the matcha cafe! We’d like to come back and spend more time here."
13,4.0,"Streets are full of a mixture of local, traditional & modern shops. The main street is shut to vehicles so it's an easy wander, with lots of side streets off.

19,5.0,Went to Insadong shopping street for lunch. It offers many traditional Korean snacks and souvenirs. Managed to find a really nice tea house that sends you back in time with it's rustic and cosy environment.
20,4.0,"A nice selection of souvenir stores, so worth the visit for that alone.  At least on the main street, more of a quaint souvenir/tourist street rather than the neighborhood feel I was expecting, but we enjoyed being able to get all of our gifts in one place."
21,5.0,"Our hotel was close to Insadong and we really enjoyed visiting many times during our stay.  The restaurants were very good, our favorite tea shop MoonBird Only thinks of the Moon was there and many very nice shops."

There is a main pedestrianised street and side alleys branching out by the side.We stopped by at a small eatery for cold noodles and mandus (Korean dumplings). After lunch we were directed by a man holding a menu card to visit a Hanok house in the side alley for dessert.There are a number of galleries, art and craft shops. I had a caricature drawn by a street artist in Ssamzigil. It was a fun place to be after visiting Gyeongbokgung and Bukchon."
27,4.0,"This area near Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung Palaces is the perfect area to stroll when one more palace is just too much. There are small boutiques, cafes and street vendors to entice you to part with your remaining won -- or just stroll and watch other tourists spend theirs!"
28,5.0,"We visited Bukchon village and after we walked to Insa-dong. There is a wide street with alleyways coming off the main drag. There are lots of craft and art outlets mixed with cafes and restaurants. There is not the hustle and bustle of some other areas which makes it pleasant to stroll, look and enjoy. A great pocket of Seoul. There were very interesting shops selling hand made fans and good souvenirs locally made."
29,4.0,"A  quiet place to leisurely stroll among arts and stores selling local handmade items, plenty of street food, restaurants, coffee shops and music. Money changer across Starbucks, a tourist Information at one end  A clean and beautiful cobblestone street conveniently located between 2 palaces – Gyeongbokgung Palace  and Changgyeonggung Palace. Plenty of benches to rest.  Also in Insadong you can rent  a Hanbok, Korea’s National Costume to wear to the palace for perfect pictures! Very easy to hail a taxi."
30,5.0,"fantastic place to stroll and wander around,buying souvenirs for home. Even a cat cafe with little munchkin cats!"
31,5.0,We came here as part of the Busan City tour and decided to come back again the next day to spend more time in this lovely area. The shops are just that bit more unusual than those we visited elsewhere and we particularly liked the antique shops.
32,4.0,Walked through this area after a visit to some nearby shrines. Some good tourist shops and galleries. Enjoyable and worth a look
33,3.0,The main “antique “ street was little more than a tourist mall but the side streets with their rabbit warrens of buildings with numerous stalls were more interesting though the items for sale looked generally to be of mediocre quality
34,5.0,"Insadong has a few street food vendors (not much really), but lots of street and sidewalk merchandise vendors and small stores, and lots of restaurants. More good people watching. Definitely should be on your list."
35,3.0,"This area is touted as a great place to go and buy artifacts. However it's more a clothes shopping places, I'd say, as the artifacts aren't all that special and look a bit fake (not handmade...)."
36,5.0,"If you are into arts, drop by to this beautiful row of shophouses. This is the place that we feel still keeps check their Korean heritage. Even the word, Starbucks is spelled in Hangul. Amazing. It is walking distance from Samcheongdong-gil though. So you can travel to 2 places on 1 trip."
37,4.0,We spent a day in Insadong taking in the sights and wandering through the streets enjoying every minute here.
38,5.0,"Insadong street was near our hotel so we walked it several times. Always something new to see, from restaurants to shops and galleries."
39,4.0,There are a lot of traditional Korean souvenirs shops you can pick and should many choices also many restaurants around.
40,5.0,Super fun to shop in this district.  Well known for its cleanliness and great for gifts.  A 'must stop' for any visitor; also great street food options.
41,3.0,"We spend about an hour and a half strolling the street. Good place for souvenirs, art work etc. There are some street food vendors. Do not miss the building - Ssamziegil where each level is connected by a spiral walkway. Interesting mix of shops - artwork, accessories, glasses, watches, handicrafts and all."
42,5.0,"The area is pretty nice, not just Insadong but the surrounding area within 15 minutes walk radius.  Recommend a visit when in Seoul."
43,4.0,"Local market! a lot of interesting places with souvenirs and street food! If you like such things, it is worth going to this place and checking it yourself! For us, it was just ok! Quite a lot of people"
44,3.0,It’s good for souvenir shopping and people watching. It can be combined with a visit to the nearby Bukchon Hanhok Village which to me is much more interesting.
45,4.0,"Insadong is a small area which is significantly less crowded than MyeongDong. We came here because our hostel was closeby and we really appreciated the tea shop there. You can get all sorts of really nice matcha teas and desserts~!The insadong area is also good for getting little souvenirs which we found to be actually quite difficult to find in other areas! You can find lots of tea ceremony places in this area, so definitely worth a stroll about, especially to get away from the hustle and bustle of other areas."
46,4.0,Loads of local shops selling handmade local goods and mass produced cheap touristy stuff. Many cafes and restaurants. Lots to keep you busy.
47,5.0,Interesting street to walk down with a huge choice of inexpensive souvenirs. Variety of different shops too.
48,5.0,"I have been there twice. In the summer, it is very crowed, populated by local visitors, which means it is not a place for tourists. A few days ago, it was less crowded but still interesting even though one can see a lot of shops selling cheap products.There is a very interesting restaurant in the area called Sanchon worth eating there. It is presented as eating monastery food. It is very spectacular, plentiful, and the service is excellent."
49,5.0,Nice shopping area where you also can have some food and drinks. We loved our walks through this area.
50,3.0,"Insadong is definitely a place of history. Souvenirs are cheapest here and aplenty. However, shops close early around 8-9pm. Ssamziegil is the main point here as the vendors are artists selling things you would not find elsewhere. The poop bread near the entrance tastes great."
51,4.0,This was our second visit to Insadong and it was just as interesting. We enjoyed the art shops in particular and the restaurants. Well worth a stroll.
52,4.0,"I felt a slower vibe in Insadong. Can't explain why, but meandering its many narrow side streets seemed the right thing to do. Many tourists and locals traverse its main street. I suggest you take the elevator to the top floor of Ssamzeigil Mall and walk down its sloped floors (skip using the stairs). It is fun to watch many male and mostly females walk around in their rented Hanok outfits, feeling like someone else from another time. I think the going rate is about 10,000 Won for 2 hours. There are lots of places to eat here. We thoroughly enjoyed our food choices at Doma, and the manager, Jun Ann, spoke English very well. You will experience the language barrier is South Korea --- but that shouldn't get in the way of having a happy and memorable time here:)"
53,4.0,"I like this place, is relaxing and enjoyable to walk along the street and see the art pieces display from the shop. There are some good eatery too."
54,5.0,"A short walk from the Gyeongbokgung Palace. This street is a nice introduction to Korean art and crafts, souvenirs and food.  The pace is relaxed and friendly. There are many street food vendors and there was street entertainment with music and customs."
55,5.0,Many shop and food have been changed to modern style but still you can find Korean special style.아무래도 한국의 서울의 대표명소이다 보니 외국인들의 방문도 많아지고 따라서 여기저기 손질이 되곤 하지만 낡음은 줄어드는만큼 청결해지고 다양해지고 개방형으로 또 개성있는 곳으로 다른 변화를 거듭해가는 듯하다. 그래도 도시에서 잊혀지는 작은 골목길 속의 다양한 풍경은 마음을 끈다. 음식이 조금 비싼 것이 흠이긴 하지만 그런 인식을 벗으려는 듯 가격 조정도 되는 것 같다.
56,5.0,This place was a great surprise for us as it was so close to our hotel honestly if you’re looking for great local food or souvenirs this place has everything and pretty reasonably priced we only had a stop over here but we definitely are coming back to Korea again and see more
57,5.0,"We stayed at Orakai Insadong Suites which have great apartments and central to all the shopping, restaurants and subway.Some great restaurants and close to Ikseon Dong alleyways which is a very trendy area for young upmarket Koreans with beautiful little shops and restaurants.Highly recommend the area to explore"
58,5.0,"Lovely neighborhood with very atractive shops where you can purchaise qualitative good especialy women clothes and souvenirs in reasonable price without need to burgain too much.Good atmosphere, clean and friendly. Prices not on the cheap side but fair."
59,4.0,I have to admit.. visiting Insa-dong was one of my favorite parts of our trip. You can find homemade souvenirs for very cheap here. Plus the street food! We tried a poop shaped pastry with chocolate in the center and it was so good!
60,4.0,Nice stroll along the insadong main street. Not as crowded as places like myeongdong. Explore the smaller streets to discover non touristy restaurants but the staff usually do not speak English nor have English menu. However the food is fantastic at these local restaurants. Tip: follow the locals who make a beeline for the best restaurants during weekday lunchtime.
61,3.0,"We visited Insadong on a busy Sunday to experience the crowds, street food and lively atmosphere. We were disappointed at how many souvenir shops there were on the main street, all selling the same cheaply made things. We much preferred wandering down the side streets and alleys, they have far more character than the main street."
62,5.0,We enjoyed this market area; lots of items to see and buy.  It was interesting seeing people in the hanbok (korean traditional clothing).
63,4.0,Loved the variety of art filled shops for shopping and you can't go wrong with your own personalized stamp.  I counted at least five shops that make them.
64,3.0,"We combined a walk through Insadong after a morning visiting the Gyeonbokgung Palace and the Bukchon Hanok village, both a short walk away. A friend had said it was a good place to look for gifts and ceramics. In fact we didn’t buy anything but enjoyed looking round the souvenir shops and galleries, and we noticed a lot of restaurants in the area. It was really busy, obviously a popular place. A couple of nights later we decided to go back for dinner but all the shops were already closed and it was also hard to find a restaurant that was still open. We did find one but they were closing at 8.30 and turning customers away from about 8pm, so make sure you go during the daytime or eat early if going for dinner."
65,4.0,"This area is more the historical part of Seoul. Old-style architecture of houses abound, but more away from the main touristy Insadong Street. Walk up the side streets for a more authentic look at this area. It is a bustling area. The main Insadong Street is full of shops for nic-nacs and art supplies. Take a look, but discover the wider area. Good access with underground rail. Wear comfy shoes as you will walk a lot!"
66,4.0,Loads of shops selling everything and lots of street vendors as well hawking all kinds of snacks. Try the local cotton candy using rice as a base. Lots of great souvenirs. Clothing is also available. Lots of fun if you like shopping.
67,4.0,"Nice area, which at weekends is closed to traffic. Lots of souvenir , antique, painting and writting shops. Above which are many places to eat and some great tea houses. Dont stay on the main street go up all the side alleys as well."
68,5.0,The area represents what it was used to be like before the whole Industrial revolution and economic boom. Me and my wife used to date alot there and the place along with Bukchon and Seochon is truly old Seoul that has been the nation’s capital for centuries.
69,4.0,Insa-dong is so nice to wander around since it’s not so crowded as other areas. You see the typical stores like artbox and lots of nice little cafes around there.I would definitely recommend going to the small mall which is in the center of Insa-dongs main street.
70,5.0,"Decided to pay a visit to this location for its historical value, and modern touches. Basically all of Korea. But it was a very relaxing walk with some good shopping, good seats, and surprises. There is an amazing restaurant located all the way at the very end of invading, you would never know its there, but it's where the celebs go to eat, it's called Buk-Mak-Gol. There are amazing jewelry shops, art works, and oh yeah the side entrance to the Presidents Blue House. Great for couples!"
71,4.0,"Insadong is a lovely place to visit. Although the souvenirs that were available here we could have also purchased in the underground markets. It’s a great place to spend a day and enjoy the touristy shops, hire a hanbock, and visit the castles."
72,3.0,You can buy many Korean traditional handcrafts and merchandise here. But the price is higher than Namdaemun and Dongdaemun.
73,5.0,"Don’t be afraid to walk through one of the many side streets in this neighborhood. Some of the best family owned spots are there. Almost all Korean food so if you’re looking for Western food, it’s not here. Lots of souvenir spots as well to browse and people watch."
74,4.0,"Insadong is hard to avoid when you are in Seoul as it's kinda between the 2 main palaces, Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung, and South of the Bukchon Hanok Village. The main thoroughfare is interesting with many shops and street stalls but it's a wander into the alleys where you will find the real gems. There are many independent galleries around and shops selling pottery. We found a traditional tea house which our friend brought us to 2 years ago which seemed to be attached to an art gallery (Dawon judging by the reviews from here?). We also found a place which sold some delicious giant dumplings. Must visit when in Seoul - Insadong has something for everyone!!"
75,5.0,"There’re many souvenir shops, restaurants, cafe along the main street. Many people in weekend. Just looking around is fun!!"
76,5.0,"Insadong is a fantastic place to look after korean art and handcrafts. Lots of galleries and shops. If you like pottery etc, you could spend hours in the street. Other then this, a huge ammount of teahouse for every taste."
77,5.0,"A nice mix of everything. Handicrafts, souvenirs, antiques, clothes, cosmetics, fashion accessories, creative artists' mall, etc. A duty free shop/mall is in the area to buy branded cosmetics sometimes at a lower price compared to the street shops. Lots of strolling shoppers any time of day but mostly from the afternoon till evening. There is also a nice traditional Korean tea shop tucked inside one of the small alleys where you get a feel of a rustic quiet, and authentic old Korean house. You can have shaved ice cream with traditional ingredients. There's street food in rolling carts in the afternoons. The tent BBQ's are also a great find here where the restaurants extend the dining area to an open space or garden for the grilling and bbq'ing setting. You'll know it's a good tent BBQ when there are a lot of locals eating and drinking inside having cheers and toasting soju or beer. You'll see the tent bbq's  get crowded after 5 PM when the locals come in to have dinner and a few drinks to celebrate or relax after office hours with their colleagues. Insadong location is near places of interest like Jogyesa Temple, Gyeongbokgung Palace, Bosingak Belfry, Jongmyo Shrine, and Kwangjang Market (sometimes spelled GwangJang), and for transit it's very nearby Jonggak train station."
78,4.0,We walked along the main Insadong shopping street. Shops mainly catered for tourists selling souvenirs etc. Quite a few cafes along the street situated on the second storeys of buildings. Many restaurants too.
79,4.0,"Along this street you can find so many souvenir shops selling south korea 🇰🇷 handcrafts and maybe there is no similar place in Seoul or at least i dont know.the products are not cheap comparing to other south asia countries ,but worth a visit."
80,1.0,Starbucks Insadong only one in Asia that wanted to charge extra for a glass of water with your $6 coffee.  Excuse me Cheap! Cheap!
81,5.0,"Definitely the place to be if you like to party and have a good time. Clubs, cafes and bars lined up next to one another and loud music playing in the street. Liked the place a lot and wish to spend more time here. Again, in terms of safety, it seems that there is relatively low crime rate in Seoul in general. We felt completely safe walking these streets at night. Plenty of taxis in the area and no waiting time to get one, even at night."
82,5.0,"We visited this place twice during our short stay at Myeongdong area. We love the vibes here, very pretty and charming and good for souvenirs shopping.The street is not very long but very lovely with shops, restaurants, cafes etc lining the street and side lanes. By the way, the Alive Museum is located there as well next to the tourist information booth.We walked back to Myeongdong area without much trouble although we could take the metro but getting up and down the stations some hard to find escalators were more troublesome. Along the way, we even had a short walk on the pretty Cheonggyecheon Stream too."
83,4.0,"You could find anything here without being too overcrowded like Myeongdong. Nice area to stay too, touristy but a short walk to the palace area and nearby there are mix of shops for Antiques, cafes, restaurants, art supply and cosmetics. You could also find cool coffee shops, craft beer at the back alley.The streets are nice and breezy with lines  of trees. On Sundays, older people hang out by the park and some church choir preaching and singing."
84,5.0,"Althogh I appreciated the vibe of Hongdae, I really felt more comfortable in Insadong, as it is more laid back. Still plenty of shopping available, only without the frenzy."
85,4.0,Walking around day or night this place is interesting. A lot of place to eat are also aaound this street! We really enjoyed it!!!!!
86,5.0,There are lots n lots of shop selling (similar) souvenirs. Strongly suggest that you:1. Know what you want then compare prices before buying.2. Don't buy in those air conditioned shop as they sell slightly more expensive.3. Visit Shin Old Tea house to enjoy traditional Korean tea.
87,4.0,Quite a quaint place to visit. Resturants galore but it's not much of a night life place. Look to the alleys for hidden gems. We chanced upon a nice bbq place in an alley and was very satisfied despite obvious language barriers.
88,4.0,"Insadong is where traditional arts, crafts and culture meets tourism. You will find some of the same kitch tourist items here that you will find in all the markets, however, if you are looking for traditional handmade items, antiques, beautiful traditional watercolour and ink paintings, amethyst (which Korea is known for) and great examples of white and green jade jewellery, leatherwork etc then this is the place. Great eating spots that are not expensive and walking distance to the 3 main palaces and Jongmyo Shrine and the traditional Hanok Village. Take the time and spend the day in the area and have a good look around. Don't buy at the first place and check your prices. be prepared to walk away if you feel the price is to high. If it can be lowered they will call you back. If it cannot they wont."
89,4.0,"There's a lot of stuff for sale that probably you don't need. Though it's crowded, it's still worth checking out."
90,3.0,"Some really beautiful artwork, pottery, etc., in upscale art galleries on Insadong but generally most of the stores were lower end souvenir or clothing.    Quite a few restaurants around."
91,4.0,"Definitely visit, stroll around, get some souvenirs or cloths/accessories or get something to eat. Visit during day time. Cool vibe, cool place"
92,5.0,"After a delayed flight due to mechanical issues in SEA, we ended up unable to make our connection at ICN to India, and had a bonus day in Seoul on the airline, so we took full advantage.  Insadong was an unexpected pleasure, easily navigated even with it's plethora of alleyways filled with stores and eateries.As a traveler, this area is ripe for the pickin'.  Lots of souvenir trinkets (some rather nice), plenty of art options, lots of restaurants and street food, and even a Starbucks if you can't stand to be far from one.  Best of all for the wayward traveler, it's an area that's part of the tourist trade, many languages are spoken, and it's just an extremely cool experience.  Interesting architecture lines the roads, and the alleyways filled with those neon signs almost beg you to explore.   Being as our time in Seoul was short, and we didn't get to explore more of Seoul within our 24 hour time frame limiting us, this area really made us want to see more of Korea.  People were nice, food was good, what's not to like?  We'll be back for a longer look around next trip through.    I've added some photos (with my failing phone camera at the time), just to give some idea of the area.  My apologies for the bad white balance."
93,4.0,This is a vibrant shopping area filled with stalls selling arts and crafts and souvenirs. There were food stalls in the area as well selling a wide variety of street food. There are also heaps of restaurants in the vicinity.
94,4.0,"This place was packed at the weekend. However it was lots of fun looking at the shops and street food stalls. It’s definitely catered for the tourists, however it’s a fascinating place to be.  Especially seeing all the traditional dress shops."
95,5.0,"Loved it ❤Quaint market street, loads of good handicrafts, food choices and Korean style clothing. Take a big bag for great purchases ❤"
96,3.0,"The street used to be something unique years ago... however, over time it became a classical tourists trap with very little of the old atmosphere remaining. It has lots of small shops with Chinese cheap souvenirs... There are however a few boutiques with Korean urban city style cloths that are truly amazing BUT unbelievably expensive...."
97,5.0,"Insa-dong is the premier arts and craft stop in Seoul.  It combines just the right mixture of old shops, modern art gallery, museums, and lots of coffee shops and eateries to make an afternoon of browsing, shopping, and eating out a whole lot of fun.  But be aware!  This area is also popular with the locals - so if you come out for a Saturday or Sunday you may be dealing with more people than you bargained for."
98,5.0,A quaint and quirky area Ssamzigil to visit for creative and original knick knacks and handicrafts to buy. We spent a good half day here. And then had traditional desserts at one of the cafe.

104,4.0,Spend half a day strolling in the area and take time to enjoy the small boutiques presenting local crafts and cheap souvenirs. Interesting Buddhist temple on the side and come back to the small alleys and pick one of the many old traditional restaurants offering great Korean dishes. Lose yourself in these alleys and you can discover great courtyards with art galleries.
105,4.0,"I've been there with my gf, the day was her birthday. We had a plan to visit a specific gallery for an exhibition, which was 'Brick Art'. The display has bee began in a couple of years ago. It was a pretty good and quiet refresh. I'm highly recommended!"
106,4.0,Not much to say. Did some shopping and eating. It was good food and good prices for the souvenirs. It wasn't busy when my wife and I were there so it was easy to get around.

108,4.0,Came for a walk - nice area for that as it is pedestrian only.  There are various art shops and places to pick up cute niche things.  We came for a walk during the day and had lunch before leaving.  Easy to reach with metro or bus.
109,5.0,"Interesting place with some traditional/ artsy shops and boutiques around. You can find some unusual souveneers and home goods made in Korea, which are usually more expensive than those made in China. I've bought some greeting cards with a paper figure of traditional Korean hanbok clothing."
110,5.0,"Take your time to go inside the narrow streets and get lost within the bars and restaurants around. Do not hurry, just enjoy being in Soul."
111,4.0,"Beautifully-laid out street, but nothing very special. Just a lot of stores and coffee shops. Instagrammable-place though!"
112,4.0,"If you like exploring stores, bar hopping, sitting in cafes, searching for antiques or memorabilia --or even bowling--this is a good neighborhood to explore. We did not have a lot of time because of other priorities.-- much to my dismay!"
113,3.0,"I think this is a good spot if you’re in the area, enjoy walking, having coffee or dinner at one of its hidden restaurants with typical Korean food.Tip, best food is the hidden streets of insadong, much better that the ones on the main streets. Try it! It’s safe"
114,4.0,"It's a reasonable walking street with some nice shops and products,  but a few will try to pressure you,  just step out and move on."
115,5.0,Very nice area and cool place to visits. Very recommend to try street food vendors. Make sure to try fried dough with noodles or honey.
116,5.0,"Every time I visit my family in Korea, I always make time to visit this area.  It’s close to one of the old palaces and great place to appreciate old Korean traditions.  Many shops selling old Korean goods for souvenirs to take back.  You can also rent the Korean traditional Hanbok dresses and take pictures around this area as well as the palace."
117,3.0,"We didn't really see anything that felt particularly ""culturally authentic"" here--essentially a strip of souvenir shops, restaurants, and cafes.  There was some traditional dancing happening at the end of the street nearest Gyeongbokgung Palace which had attracted a large crowd, but not sure if that's a daily occurrence.  Worth a visit if you need some souvenirs."
118,3.0,"This is promoted as a souvernir/tourist gift street, and it's just that. Nothing special (many of the souvenirs can be found cheaper at e.g. Daiso), however fun to stroll around and to see the little artsy shops."
119,4.0,It's just a busy short street (less than 1 km long) full of art and craft shops. Many small traditional restaurants on the alley off the Insadong main street. We came here to visit Kimchi museum (Museum Kimchikan) which is located at Insadong Maru. Stopped by a traditional tea house for jujube tea and Korean rice snacks.Spent a good 2-3 hours there including lunch!
120,5.0,"A souvenir shopping haven plus restaurants! It reminds me of Tokyo, they have small alleys that hide the different restaurants that they have.We just tried one the restaurant out of curiosity and whala, it did not disappoint at all.Would surely be back here whenever in Seoul!"
121,5.0,"So much to see in this area, particularly in Insa-dong street itself.  It's full of art galleries and design outlets. Arts and crafts abound.Excellent area to just walk about to soak up the atmosphere."
122,3.0,"If you want to buy souveniers better to go to this place. Theres a lot of items you can buy here, though the price is not really bad. you can do both shopping and food trip.. Walk from end to end there are lots of shop hiding on the sides sp make sure you go and check those small roads from left to right :)"
123,5.0,"I went here with my wife. Great atmosphere - narrow streets, chic shops, great restaurants. Really a great place to stroll thtough and have lunch or dinner."
124,4.0,"Nice shopping streets but similar to other districts for this. Make sure to try the little tea shops and Korean dessert, as this is what sets it apart from other districts. Night life caters to foreigners"
125,5.0,"If you looking for the local arts and crafts, here is the right place for you. A lot of shops selling crafts here where you can easily finds and try the local foods also. There’s a shop that u can rent the hanbok for photo-shot."
126,5.0,"Out of all of the places we shopped in Seoul, this was by far my favorite. It is the best place to find more of the traditional Korean gifts"
127,5.0,"This is the right neighborhood for those interested in art, art supplies, antiques, and very nice clothes. There are many shopping streets in Seoul but this neighborhood is unique. We bought hand made paper for our daughter and an embroidered blouse for my wife. It's also a great neighborhood to just walk about in and there is a beautiful Buddhist temple on the east side of the neighborhood. Don't miss it."
128,5.0,"There are many tourist souvenir shoos that really dont get my attention, but mixed in are many authentic traditional handicraft stores, selling wonderful handmade items.  Embroidery,  rice paper paintings, inlay boxes, ceramics and clothing.  If you look hard you can find high quality items not just tourist junk.  There are many street vendors also selling interesting small items and food. Just north of this area before the bukchon hanok village are many excellent shops and restaurants as well.  The best pottery KWANG Ju Yo, also a well known jeweler that also makes home decor items and traditional silver boxes and tea pots,  Samchung-dong.The streets get very crowded but are well worth the crowd dodging."
129,4.0,"We visited Insadong 2 times during our stay in Seoul - both on Saturday morning.  We arrived there around 10 am.  All of the store were open but not a lot of visitors yet.  To me it is the best time to avoid crowds.The whole Insadong area covers a few city blocks with 1 main street and numerous alleys.  At the front end of Insadong, there is an information booth.  We got a map there which helped us to navigate the area.  Some interesting places (e.g. Kimchi Museum, Temple Food restaurant) are not on the main street.  The map definitely helps.There are lots of stores and 1 shopping mall that sell all sort of souvenirs and crafts.  Do compare the price first as most of the stores sell similar things.  We did not bargain at all as all things are with price tags.  All the people in the store speak very simple English. There are countless cafe, snack bars and restaurants on the main street and at those alleys.  Price of most restaurants is very reasonable.  You can have a set lunch for as low as US$7.  Coffee, however, is relatively expensive compared to the food - about US$4 - 5 for an Americano or lattee.If you need to use the washroom, you can either visit the shopping mall or the information center in the middle of the main street."
130,5.0,Long wide street shopping esp for korean house decors. Some clothes shops pricey and you cam also find Korean souvenir items. Good restaurant is G Gip on 12th corner. Long line but it is worth the wait. Koreans eat as early as 5 pm.
131,4.0,"Insadong is a shopping and dining street that is interesting to visit and take a leisurely stroll.  It is not as active as the Myeongdong area but well worth a visit.  We first strolled the street, then went a few blocks to the Top Cloud Cafe which from the 33rd floor provided a wonderful place for lunch and a spectacular view of Seoul."
132,5.0,"Numerous art galleries, cafes and restaurants. Shops, museums. Lovely place to walk around but today also so many people because of Chuseok, a local thanksgiving holiday"
133,4.0,"It is a good place to buy souvenirs. Walk around shops and observe the prices before you buy something, the prices varies at the same type of products."
134,3.0,"We came here using the subway and exited from Anguk station. There were a number of shops dealing in art and crafts. As we were not art lovers, we just gave this place a short visit."
135,3.0,This used to be the area with many craft stores where the artists made their traditional wares and had a good mix of galleries and artsy shops. But many of the traditional stores have disappeared and are filled with many newer boutigues...  Disappointing.
136,5.0,The whole area is beautiful. Little alleys that lead to more and more restaurants and cafes. Great atmosphere and a thousand things happening around you. Food available everywhere. Definitely a place to go.
137,3.0,"It was very pleasant to walk around the streets, but really hard to find any good food.  Ended up eating in really tourist place, big mistake.  There are heaps of shops for souvenir hunting.  Watch out for the hills they are steep!!!"
138,5.0,"Close to the N Seoul Tower, this shopping street was on of the nicest ones in Seoul!  Lots of vendors and everything from high-end to market traders.  Jusrt a nice escape from the traditional shopping malls."
139,4.0,"It's a street with shops and restaurants, they also have art and exhibits. My girlfriend recommends the massage place on the 5th floor see pic of there business card"
140,4.0,"Hubby and i had a very interesting day . Initially we wanted to skip this part of town to checkout other places but ended up loving the place and stayed  for a few hours. After meeting a friend nearby at a cafe overlooking the palace . We were then advise to checkout the street. Without much thought we agreed for a look around. Ssamziegil was interesting but the insadong street itself was what made an interesting day for us. From people watching, cultural experience , and seeing kids wearing hanboks since its was a summer holiday time was interesting as it gives a bit of an olden time feels. Being as it was our first time in seoul, loving the sound of the beautiful language being spoken all around and its even more fun meeting locals knowing or even speaking or trying to speak the foreigners locals language base on the countries they are from. If here , do explore the small alleys that would/could lead to beautiful teahouses that has a very traditional feel's. PS: some other places tp checkout nearby- bukchon hanok village- tongin market (dosirak cafe)- Gyeongbokgung Palace- Changdeokgung Palace---------------------------------------Tips: do try the mango ice-creams u find form street vendors. Its not really ice cream but truly sweet fresh mangoes that was frozen.. refreshing indeed. Try the tea form the teahouse's and also dont be afraid to approach the kids with hanboks for a picture.. haha they love the attention as much as we love getting a picture with them.. hahah Though the boys were being a bit too macho.."
141,5.0,"Charming and authentic, Insa-dong is a small enclave of beautiful and tranquil neighborhoods with narrow alleys and full of Korean essence. We had time to kill before our tour of the nearby palace, so we decided to explore this gorgeous place. We found this area absolutely delightful. Full of charming little cafes, art galleries and shops, and unlike busy Seoul where people are less friendly and more distrustful, people made us feel welcome and comfortable. From store owners and staff to locals on their way somewhere, people greeted us in peace and well wishes. What a contrast! Even though we had the tickets bought for our tour and we were all set to go, this culturally rich neighborhood stole our heart that day to the point of choosing to forget the tour in order to stay. It was the best decision, and one we have not regretted. We loved all the rows of cute stores and traditional shops displaying all the traditional Korean folk art and crafts, pottery, dishes, tea sets and ceramics, tea houses, OMG don't go there if you love teas! We stayed for hours and eventually got hungry. So, we entered a tiny little cafe tended by one single little old lady. She was the hostess, the server and the chef, and personally invited us to one of the most memorable dining experiences we had in Korea. We still have no clue what we ate, we spoke little to no Korean and her English was nill. So, in what appeared as a recommendation, she went straight to the kitchen to labor to produce the most delicious meal we ate there. She kept coming to our table to keep us company and to tell us all kinds of stories that we did not understand. Yet, what we did understand was her beautiful soul, her charming and lovely personality that made our hearts melt with love for her. That day in Insa-dong will for ever be one of my favorite memories of any trip I have ever taken. Do yourself a favor, go! You too will fall in love."
142,5.0,"Try to discover small streets around this Main Street with lots of small local restaurants, try cold kimchi soup!"
143,5.0,Good variety of shops and eating places. Nicer stores mixed with lower end tourist types. Also some artistic shops with beautiful jewelry.
144,4.0,I like the street and there is quite a bit to do and see. BUT everything is way over priced. We bought a small bell and a small jewelry box. The next day we were in Iteawon and the same bell and jewelry box were exactly half the price. I would recommend visiting with buying your souvenirs somewhere else.
145,4.0,"Lots of little stores selling souvenirs , designer style clothes and traditional gifts. Nice to walk up and down looking at everything . We also had dinner here in an upstairs restaurant that served BBQ fish! Excellent after a long day of walking around!"
146,4.0,"Insadong is a main tourist destination in Seoul. The main street is filled with restaurants and cafes, and is probably a good place to head on your first few days in Seoul, as people are used to tourists and tolerant of language differences. Restaurants here are relatively expensive compared to other places in Seoul, but are still pretty cheap."
147,5.0,"We stayed in an AirBnB in this area, so spent a lot of time here. Lots of interesting shops and galleries to browse, tea houses, restaurants and hanbok rental places."
148,4.0,Insadong is a better place to shop and people watch than the crazy Myeongdong area. It also has some great galleries with beautiful art. Go and spend a couple of hours wandering the streets.
149,5.0,We stayed in Saerim Hotel which located on this street but a bit hidden in between the shops. Don't forget to visit the Dynamic Maze & PooPoo Land. Great experience if u are someone who enjoyed a bit of excitement & thrill AND ofcoz in a fit condition. Haha..
150,3.0,Not far from central. this area is good to visit specially for bars and restaurants in Korean style. some shops for souvenirs. I wont say it is a must visit place. you may visit if you passing from this area.
151,3.0,"Other reviews seem to describe this area as either ""quaint and charming"" on one hand, or ""touristy / souvenir-y"" on the other; I would lean toward the touristy end. More westerners here than in some other places like Gangnam, though about the same or perhaps fewer as around Myeong-Dong. So, yes, there are people walking around in traditional costume, but it seems like a show for the non-Korean visitors. There are not many big chain stores/restaurants - primarily small shops selling handicraft souvenirs and Korean restaurants, so it won't feel like Myeong-Dong or Gangnam in that regard. Come here if you're looking for ""Korean"" bric-a-brac. There are some art galleries as well."
152,3.0,"This was promoted in the tourist brochure as a street showcasing traditional Korean culture, but I find that this is another shopping street lined with the usual shops in another touristy district. Perhaps my assessment has been clouded as this is the place I dropped by after visiting the Bukchon Hanok Village, which is definitely a district with more character and personality. Nothing here is cheap, and even if you have no intention to shop, stopping by one of the cafes for a traditional Korean tea while people-watching will dent your wallet."
153,4.0,"70 minute bus ride from Incheon airport or easily accessible by the many metro stations nearby. This place is filled with restaurants, tea houses, tourist shops, bars and coffee shops. Pleasant atmosphere and excellent base to explore the rest of city.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
154,4.0,"We have always gone here when in Seoul for reasonably priced souvenirs. This time we noticed the prices were not that cheap. If you are OK with more of the real Korean market feel, shopping in the Namdaemun Market (near the south gate) is another option."
155,5.0,"My husband and I stayed 1 week in an apartment located on the edge of Insadong.  We loved wandering around there, going in galleries, eating and drinking tea!  The main street can get very crowded with shoppers and tourists but just off the main street you will find quiet alleys lined with (mostly) reasonably priced and delicious locally-run restaurants serving traditional foods: bidimbap, noodles, dumplings, rice cakes, congee, BBQ etc.  There are also a couple of nice tea houses, one with outdoor seating in a garden that is surprisingly secluded and calming...  On the main street, if you can ignore the crowds and street vendors, you will find interesting art galleries and stores selling beautiful handcrafted items along with some tourist trap places you will probably want to avoid."
156,3.0,Insadong is no longer an artists' enclave. It is now filled with cheap Korean trinkets. You can still get good food and some art materials.
157,4.0,It was only until it was too late that I made a mistake with Insadong - I thought the main street was were it was all at. Wrong. As well as so many interesting shops on the main street there are a lot of alleys with more shops. Allow yourself about 3 hours to browse the entire area and don't stick to the main street....which I did!
158,4.0,"Come here for the poop Bread and Cafe about poop. The ""dragon beard candy"" guys will also give you a show on how they make the candy."
159,4.0,"Interesting area to explore, to dine, to people watch or for taking a walk, especially after dinner.  It's a popular area anytime of the day with many choices for dining."
160,4.0,This was a pleasant shopping area with interesting stores and restaurants but not a must see.  There were street vendors selling interesting things and prices were average but there was nothing special here.
161,3.0,"Expected to see more artistic shops.  But most of them were more like gift shops.  Did manage to find a few nice art shops, so that was nice.  A couple of hours would be plenty to see this place."
162,4.0,"This is quite a fun neighborhood. For the most part it consists of one big - mostly traffic free - street with some interesting side lanes.Also you can spot quite a good amount of visitors dressed in traditional Hanbok clothes.Compared to Myeongdong this is more quiet and has a bit more space to walk. It is completely different, also when it comes to the shops. Most shops here are on the arts and crafts side. We bought some nice kitchenware here as well. And we were lucky to catch some traditional dance show (free) in one of the side lanes. Besides that there's a good amount of interesting restaurants (for good prices). And the carts selling the boiled bugs....which is totally touristy and you won't find them anywhere except in tourist areas. There's also the famous Ssamziegil Mall, which honestly was a bit underwhelming.It is a fun little area, not far away from the palace, which makes a good little walk. But Myeongdong was a place we never got enough of and we walked every night...this place here was fun. But enough to have a walk or two.A must-visit nonetheless.Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile."
163,5.0,Lots of side roads and a main shopping street . A few art galleries . And places to eat inc Indian restaurant . Avoid the cheaper eating places - the small of the food is bad . You get what you pay for ! There is too much meat in Korea but there are some alternatives here .
164,4.0,"Yes, a lot of repeated shops but varied. Visited on the weekend and had some shows and bands. Along with the shops, had street food. Walking distance from Hotel Lotte and adjacent to the palace.You could combine a visit to the Palace and Insadong"
165,5.0,Fun place to visit.  Lots of shops and restaurants and walking distance to some historical sites.  We enjoyed our morning here.
166,4.0,"We stayed in a hotel at Jongnogu (near the City stream), so could walk to Insa-dong for 10mins only.There is a main street is Insadong-gil, which is connected to a multitude of alleys that lead deeper into the district, with modern galleries, fashion and tea/coffee shops. we realized that stuffs selling here seem a bit expensive than others area, so just walked to see around and enjoyed the contemporary atmosphere here."
167,4.0,"Avoid Fridays as the many occasion we went, it is a time where schools seemed to bring their students on field trips.Not an issue but it does makes the place just that crowded.I would spent time on traditional tea houses there. No favorites but just try, they are all decent and an experienced with the nice teas and good snacks.There are many souvenir shops, I am not a fan as they are more small gifts, but if you are after good travel souvenirs, do look further than those small shops lined with the more common stuffs.Ssamziegil mall is a must go. The small shops within sells many nice goods that you can bring home. Basement has an area where you can take part in workshops and make something local. Tax refund is downstairs too.Behind the mall, there are many many good food places. Don't forget, it can be a good half day, but take time to enjoy a nice dumpling soup, Korea tea and snack."
168,5.0,"Great and buzzing shopping area. Very busy and full. Lots of traditional handcraft and art shops to choose from and very good prices. Great little eating places, teahouses or coffee shops to choose from. Recommend as a must on a visit to Seoul."
169,5.0,"Lovely rabbit warren of themed bars, boutique wineries and pre-clubs. I don't know much about Korea, but I'm pretty sure this is where it's happening. A younger seen, ranging between mid 20's to early 40's, with loud music and upbeat ambiance. One of the best night outs I've had in Asia, ever!!"
170,5.0,It's widely touted as a must visit place and for good reason because it's so close to so many other cultural attractions and has itself lots of culturally focused and specific stores that may not be selling elsewhere. Definitely stroll down the wide main street but also check out the smaller side lanes where quieter little shops reside.We randomly stumbled across a banner for Dr Fish with The Foot Shop (a local Korean chain offering pedicures and massage services) and went for it. It took a little while but we eventually found the right building and went up the elevator to a lovely and inviting spa where it cost 9000 won per person. I'm extremely ticklish but eventually I relaxed enough to stop tensing up and it was really fun. I know there's Dr Fish on offer all over the world but I'm glad I came across this place as the setting was really nice.
171,3.0,Place to visit for local hand made products. Simple street to walk through and not a huge market or maze to navigate. Good to visit if you have time but not a must.
172,3.0,This is the place one would shop and eat although nothing is special about the place. Lots of testaurants cheap and expensive.
173,3.0,"Insadong street is much too touristic, imho. Of course there are many art galleries, a lot of souvenier shops, some restaurants and shopping mall located here but it seems to be more a kind of attractions for tourists. I would say that much more atmosphere could be felt in Myeongdong district."
174,3.0,"Insadong is nice. It's got the traditional trinkets, the wide array of Korean food, etc. It does cater mainly to tourists, though, so it is a sanitised version of Korean culture. Worth a visit, but don't expect much."
175,4.0,"Only spent 3 days in a hotel right in the center of Insadong.  Full of restaurants, bars, including a couple of Craft Beer/restaurants.  Much is closed on Sunday mornings, but many open later in the day on Sunday.  People are all very nice, some English spoken at most restaurants, but not all.  2 days exploring Insadong is more than enough time to find cool places to eat and drink, otherwise not much else there."
176,3.0,This is an area with narrow alley streets with shops & restaurants. Cute for a little shopping jaunt
177,5.0,"Great little area.  Quite touristy but quirky enough to be enjoyable.  Lots of eateries, tea houses, coffee shops to sit and enjoy once you need a break from the shops!  Can pick up some good Korean souvenirs here.  Not too hard to find quality items, but the cheap trinkets are also available if thats your thing."
178,5.0,There's a halal Indian restaurant but d flight of stairs was rather steep hence d vegetarian restaurant was d next alternative. D food was very delicious.
179,5.0,"Really fun street with lots of shopping and restaurants. Always seemed busy with families, kids and adults alike. We went to this area several times and always enjoyed the experience."
180,5.0,There is a cultural ambiance with different stationery sold in the area. The streets are very clean with various types of shops.
181,4.0,We went with some local friends and they showed us a totally different side of Seoul. This area is cheaper for shopping than the main drag but our friends cautioned us to look at labels since many of the cheaper goods were actually made in China. It's a great opportunity to see authentic decor and eat at some nice restaurants.
182,5.0,It's a fun trendy area with loads to discover. just get in there and get lost. so vibrant with interesting street food vendors which offers different kinds of yummy stuff.
183,5.0,"I have been to Korea many times, when I am looking to buy some Korean specific gifts to take home to friends and family I like to come to Insadong area.  They have the main shopping area blocked off from car traffic, so there is a lot of people walking around fromall over the world.  There is a lot of the stores selling the same thing, Korean gifts, such as purses, fans, Korean Dolls, in addition this area is big on Art and has several small art studios in the area.  Of course you have a bunch of restaurants, I would say most has tourist pricing, so I personally think, better places to go eat and at better pricing.    I think this is a great area for people watching, in particular they have several stores that rent the traditional Korean clothing for a few hours.  You will see quite a few, mostly ladies wearing the traditional Korean dress called the Hanook.  A place to go and spend a few hours shopping and people watching for sure.  Recommend you go at least once."
184,4.0,"Although quite touristy, Insadong is nevertheless an enjoyable and engaging area to explore. Local craft shops, restaurants and lots of street traffic on this walking street make Insadong a must see for any visitor to Seoul."
185,4.0,We found the Insadong area particularly well suited to tourists. There were plenty of souvenirs available that we didn't see in aaaaalllll the other market areas of Seoul. Art houses and coffee shops and restaurants everywhere (surprise!)
186,5.0,"A walk or a short subway ride from Gyeongbokgung Palace is this busy street filled with shops, restaurants, locals and tourists. Loved walking down the street and people watching. Found a small underground Korean Restaurant where we were obviously the only tourists. Soup with large beef dumplings and vegetables was wonderful!"
187,4.0,"Nice neighbourhood with alot of shops and restaurants on small alleys. Very touristy, though. Constant car traffic on pedestrian areas is very annoying, though."
188,5.0,Went to Insadong after visiting the palace. There are many shops selling arts and handmade items. Do look around before buying as some shops sell cheaper. The hanbok rental is cheaper here and more designs to choose from.Do visit before evening as they close early.
189,5.0,We had a wonderful time walking through the narrow streets and alleys. Had a delicious lunch and enjoyed visiting traditional tea houses. Would definitely come back if I visit again.
190,5.0,This place is great for window shopping or buying souvenirs.  Stop at ssamziegil for a scenic winding path of great handmade items. At the top there is a photo sticker booth and cafe. Definitely worth at least one visit here !
191,4.0,We visited this place during lunch and most of the places were shut. It seems you can see a lot of action at night in this area due to variety of pubs and expats in the area.
192,5.0,Insadong turned out to be one our favorite parts of Seoul. It is a pedestrian area with lots of shops and restaurants. More upscale than Namdaemun market.
193,5.0,"Visited the Buddhist temple before venturing into Insadong. Good to wander along the streets, unfortunately the tea house we wanted to visit was closed until May, but a great experience for visitors."
194,4.0,"An enjoyable place to visit especially if you are passionate about antiques..lots and lots of great treasures..Also has fine stores..one particular store that comes to mind is called Araya. Its a very high priced boutique, mostly hats, has some clothes, extremely well made, of high quality and very pleasing to the eye.."
195,4.0,"This area is loaded with lots of shops and crafts, antiques and souvenirs.  Also lots of Hapsen costume shops so you can dress in the local traditional dress.  Neat for photos"
196,5.0,"We loved walking around Isadong. It can be a bit touristy, but it has great charm. Walk down the laneways to find charming restaurants or galleries. Great souvenir shopping! There is a large artist shopping mall. Where local artists sell their work. It's all great!! Not far is Jogyesa Buddhist Temple. Worth a visit."
197,5.0,Great place to pick up some Korean souvenirs and have lunch. Many of the restaurants are on the second floor allowing for a view of the bustling activity below.
198,4.0,Great little shops and esp. for arts and crafts and nicknacks. Great to wander around and take in the vibe. Make time to pop into shops and try the food stalls.
199,3.0,Touristy street . Good for people watching . Nothing much to explore here. Mainstream touristy souvenir and art shops .
200,4.0,"A nice place to get food or peruse small shops.  Local items, art, street vendors and other places to spend time wandering and shopping."
201,5.0,The narrow alleys and the old and low buildings give this quarter a completely different atmosphere than other parts of Seoul. It is easy to get lost in the numerous alleys enjoying the antique and art shops and strolling by small Korean restaurants.
202,3.0,fun area full of shops and cafes though it was overrun with people idly passing similar time on a Sunday afternoon. We had hoped to find wider range of antique stores and a bit disappointed that shopping seems to be for knick knacks. The children's art areas and handicrafts were fun to see.
203,4.0,"While not quite the ancient Korean experience we were expecting, the Insadong area does have a few blocks of shops....some souvenir and a few antique.  Quite a few of the souvenir shops had some nice ceramics and inlaid boxes and decorative plates.  For genuine artistic things like some brasswork, carvings, etc. the cultural shop at Incheon airport is actually worlds better even though the number of artists are quite limited."
204,3.0,"In this area, there a traditional market selling everything here, the food, clothes, souvenir, household appliance including women stuffs"
205,5.0,"During our stay in Seoul, this is the place I fell in love with. You can buy all the traditional Korean staffs here. The street food here are cheaper than Myeongdong. We paid 2000 for 1 meat ball stick here but it was 4000 at myeondong.  Korean Tradition tea is a must try."
206,4.0,"It's an ok place to walk around durring the day. Some shops, food shaks and some street food. You cand find some nice souvenirs there too..I guess it's a part of Seoul and if you stay not far from it you'll end up there.."
207,4.0,"Nice place, lots of smaller  lanes with many nice restaurants, small eateries. We just walked a couple of smaller lanes and kept to the Main street Insadong  which has many nice souvenir shops.  Pleasant walk, though nothing much to buy. Took the metro to Angguk station from Myeongdong station. Short walk from metro station."
208,4.0,"This is a good place to buy Korean souvenirs.  I liked it because the shops were great for window shopping, as well as exploring, with the heavy sales pitch you get in some countries.  And there were mostly locals, so even if there were some tourist traps here and there, it didn't feel so touristy because you're shopping alongside locals.  We stopped for lunch at one of the smaller restaurants and it was filled with locals.  The food was good and it was nice to stop and relax for a while before continuing the shopping trip.  Service was nice in the restaurant and everywhere else in Insadong.  Worth another trip on my own without my group..."

219,3.0,"It didn't live up to the shopping hype, however perhaps I didn't spend enough time there and go into enough of the large malls around it?Had some good places to eat, and the poopoo museum was there. Lots of souvenirs to buy but if you're also going to namdaemen get your souvenirs there, save 1000-2000 won per item on average."
220,4.0,"Quaint neighbourhood with traditional looking houses mostly occupied by restaurants or gallery, dotted with shops that sells Korean paper, Korean literature and calligraphy stuff, also great place to pickup some Korean made ceramic / pottery, if you look close enough you can get some really good deals and unique gifts!You can also hire a hanbok (traditional dresses) to take pictures around the palaces nearby, enjoy and have fun."
221,3.0,"It's a neat area if you have a day to spend walking around, but I've never bought anything from the area, except tea. We ate at a Buddhist restaurant near by, and I bought some tea from the O'Sulloc Tea shop in the area (we visited Jeju and I fell in love with O'Sulloc until I read the ingredients). It's a nice area, very touristy, but honestly I could have skipped it and don't plan to return."

This area is where you will find the famous toilet cafe 💩if you don't have time to sit down, there are many stalls around selling poop waffles, if your into that sorta thing, not here to judge!"
226,5.0,"We stayed here for 5 nights in Seoul. I would highly recommend staying in this area for your hotel. Pros: safe, lots of boutique shops and eateries, easily accessible to the metro and some local landmarks.

At the end of the main roadway is a tiny Korean restaurant (in the basement of a nondescript facade) that offers authentic and affordable Bulgogi!"
235,5.0,"Insandong had been our favorite shopping spot in Seoul. You will never get tired of looking around, it has so many interesting things to offer especially if you are a fan of art. Many shops within Insadong offer unique souvenirs that are not commonly offered in other stores around Seoul. It was also very interesting to see museums and art exhibits. Korean restaurants, coffee shops and street foods are also available. We enjoyed out time in Insadong, and we kept going back since it was also close to where we stayed."

241,3.0,Shopping area.  Souvenir items can be found in quite a number of outlets.  Good for a stroll and to observe the activities
242,4.0,"We were in Seoul 18-24 November. Seems that this year, autumn came about two weeks late, so trees were still yellow and red, autumn colors, when we were there.We were at Insadong on a Saturday and the weekend street protests against President Park were still going on.We started our walk near the tourist information booth (pick up your map for Bukchon here). Near the information booth is Osulloc Tea House where we stopped for tea. Then we walked across to Ssamji-gil (a shopping mall in Insadong). Do walk the shops here at Ssamji-gil. Lots is small shops selling souvenirs and trinkets made by local artisists. As you walk, you will see lots of tea houses and side lanes. We saw a quaint looking Korean house in one the lanes and walked into the lane, and discovered a small tea house selling Korean dumplings. We bought a take-away (3 fried dumplings for W3000). Yummy good!As we walked, we encountered one of the street protests marching towards us. But it was a peaceful march (see my pictures). One of the protestors was carrying his baby, so he wasn't expecting violence, else he won't have brought his baby.Towards the end of the road, you will see more street foods. We saw huge chestnuts (see my pics) on a push cart. In Myeongdong, we had paid W5000 for a small bag of roasted chestnuts. I didn't notice the price, but if cheaper, then you should try it at Insadong, We had a stick of roasted top shell. Rather inexpensive. It was a good walk. We back tracked to walk to Bukchon."
243,5.0,"Insadong has grown to be my favorite place in Seoul.  It's the experience you want to have during a visit to Korea.  Meeting friendly Korean citizens, shopping in unique one of a kind type stores and local shops while learning something new about the Korean culture.  It's well beyond K-pop, K-beauty and Cafes, this neighborhood in Seoul actually has Soul, it's a MUST!"
244,5.0,"This is a great walking, shopping and eating area.  The shops have a lot of beautiful, traditional items from local clothing, embroidery, wood work, ceramic, jewelry etc.  The great part is that most of the shops carried high end and high quality items- not the usual tacky stuff found in most markets.  One such quaint store was a store that makes stamps- Queen Elizabeth was one of the visitors to this store.  I forget the name but it is on the main drag and the fun is in finding the place.  That's what travel is all about!Added to the shopping is the eating.  This area has a large array of traditional restaurants.  Wander through the narrow side roads and peep into the windows to see which restaurant you will finally pick.  Better still do what we did.  We had purchased something in a shop and asked the shop lady to recommend a lunch place.  She pointed us in the right direction and that was one of the best dumplings we had at the Gaesung Mandu - Koong.  You can see the dumplings being made when you look through their large window.  Right across from  this restaurant is an alcove which houses art galleries and the most amazing traditional Korean tea house.  The varieties of teas and the ambience of this tea room is mind boggling- a must see visit.  All in all an amazing place.  Start walking!"
245,5.0,This is the best place to buy good quality souvenirs at cheaper prices.... you'll see a lot of people wearing traditional dress.... a must see place...
246,4.0,"The quaint and yet buzzing streets of Insadong is a lovely combination in the heart of Seoul. The place offers you local food options, souvenirs and the people and the shops are really lovely. I did not plan to spend much in this part of town - but could not resist the odd impulses from the local shops"
247,4.0,"Shopping here is knowing what to buy, but also it is trying something different- the food, the clothes, the antique art, book stores, tea houses, crafts and arts.  it can be reached by subway or by bus. We were brought there by our tour bus as it was part of a day tour. It is only a few minutes stop and so if you want to really shop then it is best to do it outside a tour schedule. We were able to buy some garments and Korean craft that were right for us. then tried some cakes sold along the gallery - it was good. It is something to be enjoyed if one is open to trying something different, something Korean."
248,5.0,"This place is just beautiful, neat and has a thick traditional element. Spending time walking and windows shopping at this place is just so much enjoyable. All shops at this place are set like vintage traditional store with korean signee if the store's name. I saw young teenage minggle with friends girls and boys wearing traditional korean dress, especially on the weekend. This place is more alive in the evening with lights and more poeple visits. Here you can shop smalls souveniers to hand made fancy arts. I like this place so much"
249,3.0,"Nice place to walk down & do a little shopping. One has to beware as the prices are a little steep but if you look carefully, bargains are to be had"

253,5.0,"It is the attraction, which I would go back to any time of the day. Vibrant, interesting, beautiful and calming at the same time. It's a not to miss while in Seoul."
254,4.0,"The entire area surrounding Insadong Gil is an excellent place to wander around discovering little trinket shops, cool restaurants, souvenir places and colorful back alleys.  Definitely worth a visit."
255,4.0,"Near to famous Palace and Temples we drop by this acclaimed must-visit area of Insadong.. It is not a small area but more attention and activates is centered around one main road with alleys on both sides. Within the charming alleys are boutique galleries and traditional teahouses, and cafes. Famous for traditional Korean fine art from paintings to sculptures there are also Korean hanbok (traditional clothing), hanji (traditional paper), traditional teas, pottery, and folk crafts.One cannot miss the new 4-storey shopping centre called the Ssamziegil (쌈지길), (double yellow upside down ""yy""). . This unique ‘enclave’ shaped by connecting in the form of a spiral-like stairway. There are small unit shops that sell various items, ranging from fashion and art to food and accessories. There are 2 fantastic restaurants in the annex building too!  Ssamziegil may be modern, but it is well blended into the surrounding more traditional neighborhood.Further down to main road of Jong-ro (Jongga Sta.) is the Market famous for Antiques of past Korean Dynasties.  There are many pop-up vendors here selling foods and trinkets. You can eat Korean traditional snacks like taffy and pancake as you shop. We find Insadon a bit different from the other many interesting Seoul streets, especially the atmosphere and ambience.  Very good for souvenirs, snacks, and just walking about, this place a must visit for tasting local delicacies. Crowded and be prepared to spend at least 3 hours browsing the stores, restaurants and little streets.  An enjoyable experience for us!"
256,4.0,"We were there to grab lunch and end up walking around the area.  There is a main road and lots of side roads.  In order to fully appreciate this area, you have to venture out to the side roads where there are lots of shops and restaurants.  I love pottery and they have amazing tea pots & cups.  There are also shops that sell other items such as hand made scarfs and misc items.  I personally thought the prices were high and end up just looking and not buying anything.  Few shops negotiate so don't be shy and ask.  Less crowded than other areas, I would highly recommend for eye-shopping."
257,5.0,"Of all shopping  place in seoul,  i love insadong the most. It is convenient and beautiful. Found some antics there which is a great find. The shops sell unique items that i couldn't find anywhere else."
258,4.0,Great place to get arts and crafts of Korea. So many different types of goods are available. We probably would have gotten lots more if not for self limits!
259,5.0,"It was pleasant to spend a couple of hours (not including lunch) walking through Insadong.  You will not be alone -- Korean tourists and foreign tourists will also be here, but we did not find that distracting.  The prices are relatively high here but you are not required to buy anything.  There are some very good art galleries with friendly proprietors."

268,4.0,"Visited on a Saturday and it is full swing with people. Lots of locals and tourist. A lot of shops and unique crafts. Not to mention lots of cafes from the beginning till end.So if you are tired from all the walking, you can stop at any cafes to recharge. The little alleys at the side has some restaurants and cafes that you.might want to explore. Exit 6 from Anguk station, walk towards your left away from the police station towards the tourist information centre and you will be at Insa-dong."
269,5.0,Visited here when we wanted to shop.  Lots of arts and crafts shops.  The Ssamzi mall is here to just as you walk in on the street on your left.  Fun to walk down the side streets looking at all the different restaurants.  A must see.
270,3.0,"It is nice but in my opinion it is a bit overrated.You can find cheaper stuffs in Namdaemun. The Ssamji-gil inside Insadong is more interesting.However ,goods are more expensive there too."
271,4.0,"This area is for tourist, there are a lot of cafes, restaurants, and shops for souveniers, nice to walk around, stop for drink, or food, a lot of people/tourist"

273,5.0,"Really liked this area,especially all the little alleys with lots of small restaurants. Best place for buying souvenirs, for sure as it offers the largest choice.Found a tiny place serving fried dumplings-fantastic for a quick and cheap lunch!There is a kind of a shopping mall with shops offering quirky, hand-made items, very colourful and fun."
274,3.0,"I visited in mid-noon.It was very crowded.Early October is very crowded.When the overlap with the Chinese holidays, and very crowded."
275,4.0,"This is another shopping street, but has a more artsy vibe. Lots of the usual gimcrack souvenirs but there are also places selling paintings, hanbok-inspired clothes, handmade silk products, or wood carvings, not to mention quirky cute items."
276,3.0,"We were taken on our way back to the hotel from the Gyeongbokgung Palace, by a Korean speaker. So rather weary and footsore. Our experience reflects other reviews - many different aspects of shopping from the high-end stores down to little curio shops and stalls run by the artist themselves. Dress for the weather - it could be very wet, or sunny and hot - or v. cold. We had a nice Korean meal in one of the many possible places in a side alley. It's essential to go with a Korean speaker who understands the cuisine - then you could have an exquisite experience in a cosy busy family-run business.Set aside a day to do it justice - but if it doesn't appeal then move on rapidly to some other Seoul attraction. The transport links are excellent.We noticed that the top end (near the Palace) seems to be a sort of Hyde Park Corner - set aside for placarding and peaceful protestors. So don't be surprised if you have to make your way through or past a group of well-marshalled demonstrators. Also the US Embassy is nearby - so came the saying 'if you want to find a policeman in Seoul, go to the US Embassy'. There aren't many visible elsewhere; but to be fair I believe that when we visited Seoul there had recently been a 'situation' involving the Ambassador."
277,4.0,"Insadong offers almost everything you would want to see, feel and taste as a tourist in Seoul within 10 minutes of walking.Yes the area is somewhat pricy but that's just how tourist areas are in general. Thst does not mean that the quality of things to do is bad. It's easy to sort out the good stuff from the bad.Don't forget to walk the alleyways you might find something surprisingly good!"
278,4.0,"I had higher hopes of Insadong with narrow old street and shops that caters to its past. The only place we enjoyed were the mask store made in the store by the owner himself but the rest were mostly designed for tourists. However, go check out the side streets where one will find amazing restaurants serving local food."
279,4.0,Bad for the guys as there are a multitude of shops selling everything from garbage to new antiques.. The rain was a problem so you had to enter the stores. We loved it
280,4.0,"There is a main road with alleys on each side, where you will see shops selling traditional stuff, cafes, art galleries. Somewhere in the middle there is Ssamji-gil, a traditional cultural shopping complex with a couple of levels. We went in the evening, and enjoyed the slow walk and soft breeze down the main road, browsing through the Korean traditional art/goods, and stopped by Osulluc for a tea and cake break."
281,4.0,"An afternoon well spent at Insadong - browsing art and craft supplies, eating 'king's sweets' and listening to their hilarious song, and watching various artisans at work. Funky area and plenty of unique things to buy, would highly recommend this area."
282,4.0,"Along the main Insadong street there are so many handicraft and souvenirs shops. In the small streets there are also lots of different types of restaurants, mainly Korean styles.

283,4.0,We went here to buy korean souvenirs and yes this is the place. Many chooses. Also we can find the kitchen utinsels made from woods. Very nice.
284,4.0,It becomes my favourite street stall. It is from the direction of Jongno-3-ga to enter Insadong. The lady has so much patience to grill the skewer. We had 3 sticks on that day.

286,3.0,I understand this place is famous for buying souvenirs. We walked passed here while on our way back to our hotel. We did not buy anything because nothing really catch our attention here.
287,5.0,"You need a bit of time to explore Insadong and the surrounding alleyways properly. Get there by metro and get off at the Anguk station.This district is also located between Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung Palaces so you may like to combine a visit to the palaces in the morning with lunch and afternoon shopping in Insa-dong, which is what we did.Get down the side streets and surrounding alleyways. We also did a nighttime food tour in this area and were surprised by what we did not see during the previous day time visit.The Main Street itself"
288,5.0,"This a delightful place for people who like to shop in small stores in a market atmosphere. Lots of reasonable priced colorful clothes and hats for women. Tons of souvenirs. Lovely restaurants hidden in alleyways. And there is a special ""Free Market"" which is a structure of at least 4 levels of tiny craft shops, some of which sell the most delightfully designed crafts, scarves, jewelry, ornaments etc. A mixture of old and state of the art in crafts...And I actually found a vegan restaurant in one of the alleys."
289,5.0,"The main street is pretty amazing. Full of souvenirs, street food, people doing magic tricks, it was pretty fun."
290,4.0,"Lots of choices, and some nice hotels in the area. Only thing really lacking were public garbage cans, which led to more street litter."
291,3.0,"The products selling are are quite commercial and not in style.  However, if you just wish to buy some traditional Korean gits back to your hometown, it is a very good place for you to do crazy shopping.  It is because almost all the shops along the shopping streets selling similar products.  Frankly speaking, not very attractive to me.  For the Korean food, of course, there are various kinds of choices around those small lanes area."
292,5.0,"Clustered along one street is a good cross section of higher quality souvenir shops and small artists and craftsmen displaying original pieces and custom fashions. This was our favorite place for small and big purchases that were useful, beautiful, and will remind us for Korea for a long time."
