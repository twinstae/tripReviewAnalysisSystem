1,3.0,"This place if for those who love makeup and everything pink. It has 5 floors i think, the first one had tons of makeup, other floors had clothes, a laundry shop and a cafe. It was cute, but not a must visit."

3,5.0,로시아 친구랑 핑크풀가페 추천했다같이 가고 사진 많이 찍었다 위치가 살짝 구석임. 디저트다 맛있고 잘생긴직원도 친절했다 추천~Cute spot. I recommend if you’re fan of pink color. Otherwise your eyes will be not so happy over there. My Russian friend took pictures every minute when she didn’t eat beautiful and delicious desserts. We also offered a tea and by the way spent a good time together. Really nice place but there was not too easy to find it :)minus: there were too many people. While we took pictures other people were waiting we finish eating and stop taking pictures :<

Didn’t expect to be so “hotel-look” and “fancy”, I totally feel satisfied with the photos and moment I got there. Come at summer will be a lot better! There is also pool inside that you can take a photo with! 💕"

Sadly we got a bad service from the staff both at Stylenanda fashion and 3ce counter. The 3ce cashier put all the cosmetic in the bag carelessly that she accidentally dropped the cheek power that we are going to buy, she looked at it suddenly she just put it back. I asked for a new one and the answer is “it isn’t broken” check it! No sorry nothing... Such a disappointment. They decorate their shop so lovely that they may forget that SERVICE is also important."

7,4.0,"I guess it is trending in Seoul now, that street shop makeup brands create a cafe inside their store. It's a nice idea to take a break from shopping all day, and also most of them are really really cute. As a girl, I cannot not take picture :pThis particular cafe has the cutest interior, but taste wise, I think the beverages are so-so. Cakes are pretty good, but too sweet for my tastebud. Overall, it's a cool hangout spot and great for taking pictures."

9,5.0,"I just loved stylenanda, it is quite expensive but it is worth a visit if you like pink :) The location is in myeongdong, there are many other stores you can visit close to stylenanda. There are 4 floors and each floor is decorated differently. I also recommend you to order the chocolate frozen milkshake <3 it was so good, I payed 6$ but it was worth it."
