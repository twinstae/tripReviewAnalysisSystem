1,4.0,"You can get almost everything at Lotte outlet mall - from clothes, cosmetics to household goods. We love the Lotte Mart. A lot of Korean snacks. The prices are reasonable too. They process tax refund at check out counters. Very convenient."
2,5.0,"Lotte Mart is a superstore where you can get high end cosmetics, snacks, groceries, household supplies and hot food. We went to get some Korean snacks and was shocked to find it packed at 6pm with mainly tourists who has suitcases to carry their purchases! Prices were reasonable with plenty of deals - 2 for 1 and ample sampling of the goods. There were instant tax refunds for tourists with purchases above KRW 30,000 (CAD35). Just outside the lines of cashiers, we saw tourists packing up their purchases in empty cartons and tape provided by the store!"
3,5.0,"We took subway from our hotel myeongdong area to lottemart seoul station. We bought korean snacks, ramen, korean tea, maskers, wine, etc. You can try a lots of free sample here. The price is very cheap. We bought 3 bottles of wine @ 5000 won. You can find many kinds of korean ramen here. We took taxi back to myeongdong ( 15min = 4000 or 5000 won ). If you buy 30000 won above you only need to show your passport then they will give you 10% tax refund at the cashier. No need to process the tax refund at airport. They will give back the 10% tax at the lotte mart seoul station."
4,4.0,"There are very affordable sellers outside the building. The location is between Lotte Outlet and Lotte Mart.The outside area looks like a temporary flea market. But, they work there almost everyday.There are apparels, shoes, bags,... Most things are cheap and decent qualities."
5,4.0,"This mall is conveniently located at Seoul Station. It sells various big name brands as well as some lesser known brands.  We did buy some items here, but not really sure the prices were indeed discounted. Nonetheless, it is place to go do some shopping."
6,4.0,"We browsed through a range of brand-name products which were heavily discounted prices at Lotte Outlets Seoul Station.  We were able to look through popular brands, such as Zara and The North Face, with up to 70 percent off.  Merged with Seoul station, this department store is a practical yet attractive glass complex with three floors full of 140 different casual, athletic, and alternative clothing lines, as well as cosmetics and accessories.  Unfortunately, you have to bring your own shopping bags.  Since I consider myself a Foody, I had to check out the supermarket, where I could shop through a maze full of thousands of Korean food products.  I bought a box load, which the wonderfully helpful staff members were happy to wrap and pack for my return trip to the States."
7,5.0,"this is a fantastic place for last minute shopping before leaving for the airport. Free luggage storage. Free boxes to pack your purchases. Lots of free food sampling in the supermarket - try before you buy. Immediate tax refund. Next to train and subway. Huge mall with a great variety of goods.  WE spent hours, and only visited the ground level."
8,4.0,Worth a visit if you are near Seoul Station and in the mood for shopping. The mall is clean and modern and large with lots of items on discount and there is also a special area that sells items on offer such as sports bags and caps when we were there.The toys area was nice because we could let the kids play with Lego while we took a rest and charged our phones and replied messages. Finally I did some shopping and bought a couple of pairs of shoes.The mall sells all kinds of brands including the high ends ones but is a relaxed place and nice for shopping. Outside the mall are plenty of restaurants and fast food restaurants as well as ATM machines and other stores.Only really worth coming here if you happen to be at Seoul Station.
9,3.0,This mall situated next to Seoul Station. Nothing big to shout bout. Just a normal mall. Discount on certain items but still consider expensive.Not worth to visit.
10,3.0,I was expecting to see a wide range of mid-range and designer things but instead found a very limited sale range at non-outlet prices.
11,3.0,"It's nice shopping Mall. Big and have lots and lots luxurious brand. Crowded. The price doesn't seems to be cheaper than anywhere else. So it's depends on your shopping preference. If you don't normally shop for branded items, then no point to go here, Better Myeongdong / Gangnam area. in Myeongdong and Gangnam, the sales person speak quite good English and lots' who are fluent in Mandarin.Suprisingly in Lotte Duty Free, the English level of the salesperson is 50% of Myongdong / Gangnam salesperson.When I went there, the for several floor were broken down. So we have to que for elevator, around 20-30 meters long que in each floor. Quite disappointed with this."
12,4.0,Good to do your last stop shopping at the Lotte Mart here cos they have free luggage and lockers for up to 3 hours. No worries if you don‚Äôt have any luggage space left cos they provide a free packing area using recycled boxes. Tape is also provided free of charge.
13,5.0,"Lotte outlet located at Seoul Station, since my apartment is just nearby, decided to check on the outlet, lots of item available here, definitely a place to go, recommended üëçüèª"
14,3.0,Large outlet mall in Seoul Station. It has lots of different outlet stores inside.  It was a nice place to look around but the prices didn't seem too much cheaper than other places.
15,4.0,"Lotte outlet is one of our favorite place in Seoul. Not only selling good quality things, this outlet also has good price. There are lots of food samples inside the mart. They don't provide plastic bags, but they provide boxes. For foreigners, don't forget to bring your passport to get the tax refund. This outlet is located near Seoul station.

16,5.0,"We stayed near Seoul Station so Lotte Outlet is just around the corner from our home sweet home in Seoul. Located inside the Seoul Station itself, offer a lot products from clothing, handbags as well as shoes. There was sale everywhere especially during weekends.The Lotte Supermarket on the other hand offer lots of Korean food, snacks, produce, cosmetics and house hold items. The price is much better than the rest of other supermarkets in the city. We went to get our daily bread, chocolates & fruits there. You should try the Korean famous Citron Honey Tea & Lotte Peppero. You will love it like we do!Please bring your own plastic bags as they charge for that. If you are a tourist, do bring your passport along for tax refund if you spend more than KRW30,000. We bought facial masks from Innisfree & Etude House there ^_^"
17,5.0,Great supermarket full of korean stuff! Great place to get snacks for family and friends back home. Many opportunities to sample food products! People are seen purchasing boxes of groceries! Remember to bring your own bag though as you need to pay for bags. Boxes are free.
18,2.0,"I don't know why it's so crowded, the items sold doesn't seem like outlet price, so didn't border to buy anything."
19,2.0,My hubs was the only one who was most pleased with this place as he bought his Le Coq Sportif apparels at very good prices compared to those in Singapore. This place ain't really worth a visit unless you are in the area. However the Lotte supermarket next door is a heaven to be in! Lots of people buying local snacks in boxes!
