0,4.0,"This little museum covers about 500 years of the Joseon dynasty's lifestyle and their contributions to art and literature. The old scrolls provide an interesting insight into the development of the Korean alphabets. The dynasty was known for its passion for record keeping through resident scribes and hence a lot of scrolls and record books. My host said that even after the Korean alphabet had considerably evolved, the scribes preferred to write in Japanese and Chinese as it was considered a symbol of high status and intellect to be conversant in these langauages. Also of interest are the arts and crafts on display and also the traditional clothing. Some foods have also been recreated for display. My host later pointed a dessert to me in a restaurant where we had lunch that the same dish was also part of the Royal menu displayed in the museum."
