0,3.0,"In terms of neighbourhood Itaewon neighbourhood is like some London‚Äôs Zone 4 and beyond. Metro is on Line 6 so you need connections to get to the more popular Lines 1, 2 and 4 destinations. So Itaewon has the basic offerings but the market is not like Namdaemoon, the underground mall is not like Hoehyeon and the shopping is not as upscale as Myeongdong. I find accommodation there expensive relative to other outskirts. The area is slopey thus unsuitable for the not so fit. On the plus side: there is direct access by limo bus to Incheon airport. The affordable food joints are aplenty and its a haven for muslim travellers with a mosque and many choices of halal offerings. And for party goers, there are plenty of hip joints. The food joints open till late. As Seoul has excellent and affordable public transport system, I would stay elsewhere for cheaper accommodation (there are also other places with connections to airport and the city) but visit Itaewon on need basis like I visit central and busy Myeongdong."

4,5.0,It's an international food galore! Its a very hilly area to stroll but really worth the climb. Lots of halal restaurant too. Nice experience overall.
5,3.0,Was told this place has good bargains... yes I agree but mostly clothing. Timberland along the main road though is worth visiting for their sale items and maybe a few local restaurants..  you need a translator to enjoy because only a few speak English.

10,5.0,"We went here simply because we went to get our lunch as we were told that there were lots of halal diners. True indeed, you can easily spot halal kebabs everywhere from The Sultan Kebabs up to any other small shops selling the same thing. We did have our lunch in one of the kebabs diner. Excellent kebabs, delicious & affordable. We also got to see lots of Malaysians there, maybe because there was a nearby mosque there. Nothing much to see other than that. It is also a walking distance to Leeum Samsung Museum of Art."
11,3.0,"Go here for the nightlife. Lots of restaurants and bars so expect loud music, cigarettes, booze, etc. Lots of shops too."
12,4.0,"Great for shopping, exploring, and eating during the day.  Also good eating and drinking at night. Whether you are searching for souvenirs or a craft beer you can find it in Itaewon. No need for a paid tour-- just wander around and enjoy the sights and smells."

I didn't like  this place because most of people  so mean and and they take advantage of tourist,Bad sewer smell and it is crowded."
15,5.0,"It was after 4 yrs we went to Seoul since December 2012. My husband, myself and our 4 yrs 7 mths old daughter stayed in myeongdong area for a week where it can easily go by exit 4. It was a walking distance to namdaemun and not far by taxi to itaewon and dongdaemun. We having breakfast at the Korean muslim restaurant EID and during that time there was 2 menu available (meat and chicken)"
16,3.0,"I have been here many times in the past myself to pick up cheap knock-offs...but with so many places to shop these days, there is no particular reason to go to Itaewon. The one exception is that this is a unique place. The foreigners here will outnumber Koreans. There are some good ethnic restaurants. Ok...I guess if you must, you can visit this unique place to see where you used to go for all things foreign. With so many GIs in the neighboring base, you can find your share of seedy bars...at least you used to in the hilly surroundings."
17,4.0,"Ive been there for lunch and prayed in the masjid. The street is very diffrent from other city, cause is little bit messy and not clean there are leftover in every corner od the street... But there are many halal restaurant good for moslem"

Not only does it cater for muslim travellers but the area also has streets of shopping too. Very hilly area but great place to find souvenir to bring back to home country. There are tourist stores that sell clothes attire like shirts, caps and shorts including socks. There are even posters and korea music CD to buy. Apart from that, there are also sport shops like Adidas or PUMA basketball shop and custom jersey stores at the area and many other shopping stores in the area. For transport, there is bus stop and the area also has subway too."

21,4.0,"This an area packed with locals and tourists alike. Lots of restaurants, bars, cafes and eateries. A good place to soak up the atmosphere or just sit around and do people watching.  Some street musicians are there too to entertain the crowd. Shops abound too but the price may be high. But I saw many shops are having promotion and sales."
22,4.0,If you wanna try different kind of international foods... If you wanna have Halal restaurants... If you wanna pray in a Masjid... If you wanna see different people from different cultures... Itaewon is the best area in Seoul...
23,5.0,I was stationed here 20 years ago and man has it changed.  Some for the bad but alot for the GOOD.  great place for foreigners if its your first time to Seoul.  It will let you ease into the Korean culture.  But don't stay here there is so much more to do in Seoul!!!
24,5.0,We came to the area to find a restaurant for dinner and man oh man- loads of options here. There's also a bunch of shops. It's within walking distance to yongsan base so we did not bother with a car. Can't wait to go back and explore some more!

Never know what you are gonna find! This area had lots of brand name stores such as: Nike, Sketchers, Crocs....."
28,4.0,If you looking for halal food especially for Muslim.. you may come here..A lot of halal restaurants with so many choices.. I went to Eid Halal Restaurant and the food is daebak!!
29,4.0,"Itaewon was an interesting neighbourhood to visit for an afternoon. There's some shopping there (international brands like Vans and Aldo) but things are pretty expensive. There are a few souvenir shops as well. The walk up to the Seoul Central Mosque was tiring but pretty worth it. Lots of food to eat here as well; kebabs, briyani, authentic Korean food and Malay food as well."
30,5.0,"Staying at Roy' white house gueshouse... Its a simple and small apartment yet suits us perfectly...Itaewon- city with multiracial communities. Food not a problem for muslim if visiting Itaewon... Clothes, souvieniers, boots, shoes, etc anything u can find it here.. Even the branded clothes- adidas, nike, sketchers to name a few."
31,3.0,"Itaewon is a great place, if you would like to see many tourists and eat the food you would eat at home. All the major brand names have a shop in Itaewon. Highlight for our kids was the Hello Kitty Cafe."
32,4.0,"When i visited this city, i felt like being in other country. It has multi cultural tastes. Arabic, oriental, European, Korean..Most of all, it' close to centre of Seoul ,CITY HALL . It means you can easily access to all the way to trip."
33,5.0,This was a very busy area.  Great to walk around and people watch.  Lots of places to eat.  This would also be the party area.
34,3.0,"We stayed at a vacation rental house in the heart of Itaewon, about 3 mins walk to the station. This area is very hilly and is good if you have strong legs ! ( reminds me of Central and Sheung Wan in Hong Kong). My daughter injured her leg and is  on a wheelchair and we are traveling now with elderly parents , hence the walk on uneven road is challenging .....by an estimate , I think there is about 30% of the road that is not too wheelchair friendly.  Seoul is generally not too handicap friendly as well. You rarely see people on wheelchair. (I saw 3 in the last 5 days) The back lanes and isles have so many great restaurants we wish we could stay and try many more ......The antique furniture street is a fun walk to look, laugh and chat with families and friends.Overall is great apart from roads unevenness .....and o yes, I should mention that , many trash are left on sides of the roads ..."
35,2.0,"Although the prices are cheap, so are the goods. Having explored a few other shopping districts in Seoul I wished I hadn't wasted my time or money on the beer flooded streets of Itaewon. Leave this district for bar crawling. If you do end up shopping here. Look for frames by Mr. Lee down on the left past the wide street stairs and his beautiful antique water color shop. Some of his prints matched exactly what I saw at Buddhist temples on our city tours. I wish I could have stopped in to buy more."
36,4.0,"Foreign brands were having a sale when we went there. Got plenty of items at Skin Food. Was actually confusing and difficult to navigate. Wasn't able to check out a vegan resto because it was so difficult to locate. When a friendly shop owner was finally able to tell us where it is, we didn't have the time to check it anymore as the hotel shuttle was about to arrive at the drop-off/pickup point."
37,4.0,"The main strip in Itaewon is great for international travelers. They have great food, bars, and places to shop. I recommend trying the Paris Baguette in Itaewon, its my favorite place."
38,4.0,Special zone for muslim. Easy to find muslim foods especially kebab. Go to musree restaurant for koreAn foods. Price a not really expensive. Go and try kimchee.
39,5.0,"Only place where you can find Indian, Bangladesi stores. Where Indian food items available easily. Currency change in this are also provide good conversion rate."
40,4.0,"Was stationed in Taegu and then Yong San (Seoul) Korea, with the U.S. Army, 1999-2001. Was in Taegu a year without my family, then the following year, went home & brought my family, since I was being moved to Seoul, following a promotion. Itaewon is an all-round district: shopping, club scene, hookers, restaurants, places of worship, etc. Seoul and very close to Hannam Village, where I lived with my family. Prices are higher, since it's in the heart of Seoul and very touristy. Better prices are found at the Moons (Nandemoon, Tandemoon, etc.) or Osan. But if you're in Seoul for a short trip, you can find everything in Itaewon. They make really good fake Coach or any name brand purses but they hide them behind the counters because they aren't supposed to sell a non-numbered purse. When they know you're serious about buying, they will bring out the numbered purses. Itaewon and most of the shopping districts aren't very sanitary (sewage problems, debris, dirty bathrooms, etc.) but if you're game, you can find very good deals and also talk the price down. It really is a shopping haven where you can get suits, boots, bedding, etc. tailor-made,.They really want to make a sale so walk away if it sounds too high and you might get a better deal, there or somewhere else. Need comfy shoes to walk and try taking public transportation, since driving and parking is a nightmare. Chejudo is not in Seoul but a nice out of town place that's very affordable and out in nature."
41,3.0,Seoul City Tour Bus will get you to this Itaewon area if you like antique stuffs and goods great for collectors.
42,3.0,"From what we heard about Itaewon, we were expecting better deals. There are plenty of restaurants and shops but, nothing spectacular. It was crowded, a little bit dirty with nothing really of interest.  If you are wanting a relaxed shopping experience take the subway or a taxi to Insadong!!"
43,5.0,"Itaewon is one place that you can see so many tourist from any other countries! It is like a tourist town in Seoul. Here you can get Halal foods easily. There is a kebab, Arabian foods. You can find a mosque in Itaewon. Lots of shops that sell souvenirs, here you can use your bargaining skills."
44,4.0,different choices of night life for foreigners plus it is a good area to have a nice dining with many options from traditional korean food to fast food .
45,3.0,"If you want a real taste of Korea DONT GO TO ITAEWON!We went to Itaewon to eat at a specific Indian restaurant the ""Foreigner Restaurant"" (named appropriately for that area in my opinion) and a bit of shopping & have NO desire to ever go back. The restaurant was ok not the best indian we have ever had but decent. If you have a desire for things Korean this is not the place for you it is totally Americanized. Granted there are people from ALL places of the world there it still felt like we were in America & not Korea. We had heard quite a bit about Itaewon therefor were excited to check it out, but sadly it was a disappointment. The BEST part of the day happened to us on chance (the ONLY reason I give Itaewon 3 instead of a 2) & saved the day. After eating we just walked down the main street when getting off the subway just to see what it was like & were talking about getting back on the subway to go to another part of Seoul when all of the sudden there were these stairs....so we went exploring. WOW were we happy we did that! Beautiful city views w/ a mountain feel. After 1 set of stair we we up a second set & walked the mountain. We crossed over a bridge to the park & it was amazing! With the fog it completely felt like we were hiking in the Smokey Mountains but in Korea.  It ended up being a wonderful day.If you are a family or someone who wants to really enjoy what it is to be in Korea this is NOT a place for you. Also if your looking to shop this is NOT the place for you. Go to the Namdaemun Market or the Gangnam Underground Shopping Arcade where you will get way more choices at way way better prices. They a very pricey in Itaewon because its a tourist trap. I bought a pair of shorts I saw in Itaewon for 10,000 Won at the market for only 5,000!!!! Same things with like the chopstick, my daughter wanted this pack of chopsticks that in Itaewon were 10,000KW & we got the SAME 1s for 5,000KW at the market. Now if you are someone who wants to party & feel like you are in the States then this place is for you.I think if you have a limited time in Seoul don't go here it is a waste of time, but if you are in Seoul for a extended amount of time hey go check it out just to say you've been to Itaewon."
46,3.0,"We visited Itaewon while on vacation recently, because our host recommended it - because they have some bigger sizes in clothes compared to other markets.First of I'll say it was cool. I enjoyed my time is Seoul and everywhere I went. There are restaurants everywhere - just like most places in Seoul, and lots of places to shop - although like most other places the items start to repeat themselves.The one thing I didnt like about this area was that it seemed like a ""tourist trap"" to me. Its known to have international food and foreigner friendly - which it was, but everything seemed to be priced higher than other areas like namdaemun, Insadong, yeongdeungpo underground shopping, etc. And honestly, there are most the same products as these other places. I would recommend going there just because you are in Seoul and of course you want to see a lot of places - but don't expect too much different. I still had a good time, but didnt really buy anything except some drinks in a pouch on the street."
47,5.0,"This area is great for the atmosphere, hotels, and variety of different kinds of restaurants and people you will find.  The nightlife is great and there is always something to do and enjoy here.  This neighborhood gives Seoul and international feel to it and is a must see for anyone visiting Seoul for a week or more."
48,3.0,"This is an area/neighborhood in seoul where you will see more westerners than in any another part aside from insadong.There is basically one Main Street with shops(quite a number of 7-11s)and restaurants on both sides,and, branching off in other smaller streets.we we there from around 11am till around 2 pm on a weekday, there were people around but not as much as the crowd in myeongdong and insadong..maybe itaewon comes alive much later?We did not get to visit itaewon on our first visit to seoul, we made this stop on our second trip. Rightly so.this neighborhood is an experience, a nice place to hang out..but,for us, not for a short first trip..for a longer trip with days to spare it would work better.We came here primarily to visit the International Clinic..a find if you need medical check ups, someone to administer vaccines/shots(like us, 40,000 won, very professional,English speaking)..get an appointment through their website first.Someone tipped us that you could walk from itaewon to a part of the Han river in around 20minutes,we didn't do it though..so can't say for sure.We ate at a Turkish restaurant called Pasha..excellent bread, excellent food.highly recommended."
49,5.0,"I went to this place upon recommendation from my friend.This is a great place to shop. Apart from them obvious sight of many merchants there, the landscape changes as dusk approaches. In the day time, shops open normally starting from 0900hrs. However as time goes by, street carts start their business and the vibrancy of the entire area lifted by another notch. Eateries, cafes and restaurants offer rest for tired feet after shopping and there are so many situated around the entire shopping belt which ensures that shopping can continue excitingly after a recharge.Getting there is easy by subway, though I find that taxis are not that expensive as well. Overall a great experience, my wife and two kids were shopping there from 1030hrs till 1700hrs."
