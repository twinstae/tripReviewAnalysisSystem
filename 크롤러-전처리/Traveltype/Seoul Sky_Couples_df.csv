0,1.0,"Very long queue going UP. Staffs keep on explaining in Korean, not even speaking in English. When we arrived on the observation deck we saw very long queues heading towards the elevator going down. Definitely not worth it. Waited for about 3 hours in total."
1,3.0,"A must spot to visit ,but very commercialised .Just shops in all departments, the main reason for going must be to see Seoul from the viewing towers."
2,5.0,"I think this is the 8th tallest building in the world, and as such, it offers some spectacular views of Seoul. We sat in the bar overlooking the old Olympic site, and it was a stunning view. From the rest of the vantage points you could see the city in a totally different light. Well worth doing! We didn’t book ahead, we arrived around 1030 and the line wasn’t too long, so don’t worry too much if you’re a last minute planner"
3,4.0,"Yes, it is a must do and see. The tour to the sky tower.It so well organized. All  in such young hands. You have to do the foto shopping tour. It was fun and you have a nice remembrance.The weather was good and clear, so we had a fine view.Our hotel was just in front of the Sky Tower, so we had also a perfect night view."
4,5.0,"It's so beautiful. We went there around 4:30pm , after playing in Lotteworld. We see the day view, sunset view and night view from the Seoul Sky Tower. Tallest in Seoul. One of the tallest in the world too. It's so beautiful !!!"
5,5.0,"This was at least 1,000 times cooler than I expected.  The glass floors, and the views are amazing.  The elevator ride itself is super cool, and probably worth doing in itself.  There are some refreshments at the top of the tower, which is pretty nice.  I am very glad we did this, and I would certainly do this again."
6,5.0,"The view was breathtaking. Dont get stuck on the first floor after getting from the elevator, as you will have to go two more... :)"
7,5.0,"Home to 45,000,000 with a modern look and lots of things to see and do.A very Beautiful country with the third largest building in the world. I call it Sky Tower and it is awesome with modern light designs that flash, dance and move around in different directions. It has a glass floor balcony that you can look down at the rest of the city."
8,4.0,Since this is top 5 tallest buildings it’s a must. Spectacular view and design of the building plus it has one of the fastest elevator I the world (8m/s)
9,4.0,"When we visited the observation deck of Lotte Tower, it was not very crowded and this made the experience fantastic. This is the third-tallest observation deck in the world and it has the highest glass floor in the world. There's also ""balconies"" which are more like a portion without a ceiling since the windows are still a storey high. Overall, we really enjoyed seeing and experiencing the tower. I wish I could rate it 4.5 because the view isn't as nice as the view from N Tower (however, the experience is much better)."
10,5.0,This tower has many angles of the city to veiw it is just incredible once you get to the top of the tower there are many places where you can get a goofd picture of the city or with yourself in it if not there are various points whete they would take them for you. There is also two step out decks where you wouls see right down to the bottom of the tower.Then you can choose which pictures you would like to be printed of the picture's that were taken...this is not expensive compared to many other places i have been too.Good Luck to you
11,5.0,We visited on a public holiday to find queues that would take a couple of hours to gain admission at KW27000 each.However KW50000 (usd44) bought a Fast Pass ticket which was literally that. We were escorted past long lines to the lift which then took us to the Sky Deck on Floor 118 which is approx 480m above ground.....the trip took less than one minute!!! You can then go up to 122 floor at no additional cost or for a small fee to 123 floor. The view over Seoul and the surrounding metropolis is superb and we were very fortunate that the weather was totally clear with not one cloud to spoil it. The Sky Deck has a glass floor near the edge allowing you to look straight down onto the ant-like people and vehicles below.The tower was opened only in April 2017 and is located within Lotte World complex in Olympic Way. Thus it is a very new attraction but one that will surely rise to #1 very soon
12,5.0,"It is something stunning!!! At level 0, after the ticket office you can see a movie from during the construction of this tower - the first shock (for the civil engineers it is very interesting). In the lift you will see a movie about ancient Seoul -  a very nice introduction of the city. When you arrive at 118 floor the view is wow!!! At the next floor it is a glass floor - stiunning view of the earth under youre foot. Next floor it is a terrace at 486 m. This visit it wort every won!!!"
13,4.0,"The observatory just opened to the public on this year April. You may expect a big crowd (including the locals) purchasing the tickets especially during sunset. Try to allocate some time when selecting the time slot because you need to pass through the security scan and wait the lift to arrive. Remember to get ready with your phone when the lift is going up to the top.I managed to see the sunset and the 360 degree of city view was amazing. However, it might be crowded (at observatory area and cafes) and need to queue again to get back to the ground floor."
14,4.0,"If you are wondering if it's worth paying W27,000 per person to go up to Seoul Sky - it's a resounding yes! I was reluctant initially but the views from the 117 - 121 floors are amazing and breathtaking. There's also a glass floor where you can step out on and you'll enjoy the experience if you do not succumb to vertigo. Definitely a recommended experience.There the ubiquitous Lotte hotel, mall, dept store and theme park within the same compound so you can make a day visit of everything."
15,5.0,You could see beautiful scenery to city view and N tower looks beautiful from so far. I loved watching sunset from its top floor lounge. Go In evening so that you can see city in day and then at night.
16,5.0,"Staff were beautiful and friendly and informative. The amount of work that has gone into building the tower and putting other electronic elements to enhance the experience is inspiring!! Visability was poor, but we could see enough to enjoy the experience. I definitely recommend this, but maybe try it at night time too."
17,5.0,"My husband and I were debating to go up, it's a little steep for admission, but we were very surprised by how great it was once we got up.  There are 4 different floors to explore as well as a restaurant at the 123rd floor.  We knew everything would be pricey, so we just ordered the cheese plate ($23 US) and were shocked at how big it was!  It was the perfect snack for us as we wanted to eat elsewhere that night but it was worth going up to the top for it.  The views were stunning that day and hardly anyone to compete with the view.  We stayed a couple hours (that is a lot for us) and just soaked in the view."
18,4.0,"Fantastic sights of the river, seoul tower and the Olympic park. Down side is that if you go at night it's extremely difficult to take any photos as even the outside viewing deck has glass surrounding it and the reflection  from internal lights spoils the photos. Busy, but worth doing."
19,5.0,"Zip to the 117th floor of the 5th tallest building in the world for a thrilling, panoramic view of Seoul from Jamsil. Continue on up to the 122nd floor andtake a short elevator ride to the 123rd floor.Lunch while drinking in the breathtaking view. It is totally worth it!"
20,3.0,"At night too much interior light glare on windows to get clear photos, and both Terrace closed for weather.  Late in evening no lineup and whisked to top, kind of sparse up there but it is new.  At Jamsil subway station, many other Lotte brand stores surrounding."
21,2.0,"I know Lotte World aren't responsible for the poor air quality in Seoul, but to build such an impressive tower with such a well planned observation area seems somewhat shortsighted (pun intended). With a viewing deck at 485 metres (double that of the shard), I would expect to see into the future, but visibility was just about limited to 10km on the day I visited which was very incredibly disappointing (but I am aware is par in this part of the world)Once you get to the viewing area (via the super fast lift - around 100 floors in a minute!), it was mob rule. Lying on the glass deck appears to be a favoured pose. Thats fine. But having to step over dozens of others to get to the edge was irking. Then repeat to exit. Walk to the other side of the platform. Repeat. And so on.I understand it hasn't been open for long so maybe with time things will settle down and some good old fashion queues will start to pop up to instil a spot of order to proceedings. Or maybe they could charge for anti social posing...In the meantime, sharpen your elbows and check the forecast for the day."
22,5.0,"27,000 may be a little expensive for this observatory but the fact that is brand new makes up for it. Long lines to get in for the same reason. A lot of good souvenirs availables. The view on top is pretty amazing"
23,4.0,"My husband and I enjoyed visiting the Seoul Sky observatory, though we would recommend checking the air quality/visibility level before you go. Visibility was only 6 km the morning we went, and though the views of the city were still quite impressive it could have been much more exciting on a clearer day. We took the subway to Jamsil station to access the tower. The elevator to the top of the tower/observatory is amazingly fast and offers smooth ride more than 100+ floors up in 60 seconds! We thought the staff did a great job controlling the crowds and were able to see everything we wanted to at the observatory. We also had the good fortune of witnessing the Korean Black Angels jets practicing for an air acrobatics demonstration while we were there! It was a great visit overall."
24,4.0,"Felt very excited and looked forward to visit Seoul Sky observatory tower (World’s Third Highest Observatory). We went on the weekend and hence really crowded (mostly locals). Number of people going up the tower per session (30 mins apart) were limited and it costs ₩27,000 per adult. We anticipated a lot on the glass-floored observation deck and the double-deck sky shuttle elevator which can move at a speed of 600m per minute (world's fastest). The elevator will stop at the 117th floor and we can view the entire city through the glass walls on all sides. It was impressive.From 117th floor onwards you would have to take the escalator up each floor. The glass-floored deck is on 118th floor. It's  interesting and fascinating as we looked down and through the floor. We could see moving vehicles on the road and feel the height of the tower. However, it was really hard to take perfect shots due to crazy crowd at the glass deck. There were souvenirs shop, ice cream shop, etc too.Overall, it was a good to visit for first-timers. Go during weekdays with less crowd to have more opportunity to take good pictures.To get here, take Seoul subway line 2, alight at Jamsil station and get out from exit 2. Walk further in and you will be able to see ""Seoul Sky"" and the tickets sales counters. The counter staffs can speak english, so no worries."
