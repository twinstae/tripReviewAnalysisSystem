Seeing Seoul from top, bathed in golden sun rays, it was really worthy went all the way to Namsan Tower against breezing wind winter. A cup of hot chocolate was enough to keep me warm during my visit."
1,4.0,"The day we arrived in Seoul, after putting our luggage at the hotel, we straight away took a bus to Namsan Tower. I booked the ticket using Klook and scanned the ticket at the entrance. The view at night is amazing you can see the whole area. If you have strong legs, you can walk up the hill."
2,5.0,I sure am a sucker for towers and tall buildings I donno why and Nseoul tower was one of the best..121 floors high I guess and the glass bottom and all the photo ops..we all had a good time!
3,4.0,"Its a pretty nice place, I enjoyed the hike up to the tower, got some great pictures. Not really worth the money to go all the way up to the tower tho."
4,5.0,Super awesome place! I really love everything from here . Would like to go back again here! Super worth it
5,4.0,"We had 1 day in Korea, so we decided to go despite the weather.  It was a lot of people, local and foreigners. We can only imagine how spectacular it would be on clear day"
6,5.0,"Namsan Tower is known for many things: the cable car ride, the nice trekking at Namsan Park, the great aerial view of the city, museums and caf√©. ¬†At a height of almost 240m, the tower has an onservatory deck that offers an amazing view of the city. The iconic letter ‚ÄúN‚Äù was the result of the remodeling of the tower in 2005. Since then, the place is known as N Seoul Tower, with beautiful bright lights at night."
7,5.0,"What a gorgeous view of Seoul at night! When we got on the bus to go to the tower, I didn‚Äôt realize that it was at the top of a hill/mountain so I was surprised that we didn‚Äôt just walk, but I was thankful as we made our way up the windy roads that walking wasn‚Äôt happening! It was definitely worth the trip and I loved the whole experience. Would definitely do it again next time I come to Seoul, but maybe during the day next time!"
8,5.0,"Amazing view from the TOP after we trekked 1.5km up . There a love locks area up the mountain . Sky tower are awesome , we got to view beautiful Seoul because the sky was cleared ."
9,5.0,This is where you can find the famous Love Locks in Seoul. Offers a beautiful view of the city during the day & a magical view at night.
10,5.0,"I recommend going to the N Seoul Tower Observatory at night since you can see a beautiful view of Seoul~ There are a lot of places to eat and shop. As couples, you can ""seal"" your memories here through the Love Lock bridge (locks are sold in vending machines which is so cool!) The easiest way imo is taking a bus to any available station near you. Also, the comfort room in the observatory is something you shouldn't miss üòã"
11,3.0,Lots of walking n sightseeing if u have time can easily spend half a day. Trick to photographing is to tilt your cell phone to adjust the background.
12,3.0,We went there upon arrival so we not dat familiar with the subway and bus - we kinda took the wrong route but ended up at the entrance near the library. It is quite a hike to go up so we wud recommend you to take the shuttle bus no. 3 or 5 which wud bring you up to the tower üòÇIt is true that the best view wud b at night but you wud want to be there before the sun goes down for photo purposes. We took the bus to myeongdong after our trip to namsan.
13,5.0,I have seen this tower so many times in dramas and couldn‚Äôt wait to see it in person. I was not disappointed.  The fabulous views from the top were amazing.  The locks and hearts were just as I imagined. I‚Äôm so happy I got to experience this.
14,5.0,"visited this place before but didn‚Äôt appreciated it much because too many people and long lines.. but this visit is so magical, 10am just about it opens, you can appreciate the place and better view, weather also cooperated, bright and clear sky even at a very cold temperature of -4C"
15,5.0,Honestly loved everything about this place..N-seoul Tower is probably the most beautiful place ive been and I live in NEW ZEALAND..Seoul is my favorite country
16,5.0,We had a beautiful day here.  You could see the whole city from the top.  It has super clean restrooms too.
17,5.0,It's an amazing tower in SeoulYou can see all Seoul from the topNice places ther is restaurant and coffee shop
18,4.0,As usual the tower Is a must if you wish to see the city from the top.Great view and location around is also interesting.
19,5.0,"One of the best viewing platforms in Seoul. Only costs around ¬£4 compared to ¬£16 at Seoul's Sky. Although the observation deck is lower the view is much more beautiful than Seoul sky and you can see all the sky scrappers which are especially nice during dusk and at night when everything lights up and there is an outdoor observatory too. Forget Seoul Sky, do this instead.Recommended"
20,5.0,"It is a tower located on the hillside, you need to take a cable to go to the hill top, you need to walk around the square where you will see lots of padlocks. But, you have to pay for 11,000 won to go up the observatory to see the whole country view.  You can also have a meal at the top before you come down."
21,4.0,"We were there on a Korean holiday so it was very crowded.  So much so, the line was too long to up up into the tower.  We went by cart as far as we could and walked around Namsan Park. Even from there buildings below looked liked a ""Legoland"".  Great perspective of the highly populated, dense city."
22,5.0,The view of Seoul city is beautiful to see from this place. I recommend to come here by sunset. There is an area where you can leave locks of love so don't forget to bring your own locks and write a message if you'd like to leave one. There are also shops and food shops. It's easy to get there by bus as well.
23,4.0,"Seoul North Tower was the final stop of our first day tour in Seoul. I can truly say that we were not ready for walk up the steep hill/incline/mountain (lol)  to get to the tower. Of course. there‚Äôs easier way to via Tram. But we decided to be brave, it was a real workout, but worth it. Our guide took care of tickets and other requirements for us to get into the Tower. What an amazing view. What was most noticeable to us was the cleanliness of the place. Well maintained (in comparison to my experience at the Tower in Paris). Although, it was crowded, walking around was easy. An highlight for me was the toilets in Tower. Our guide suggested that we should see it even we didn‚Äôt want to use it. (Pic below). There also other attractions on the grounds of the Tower as well. Well worth a visit, but be sure you are rested and ready to take it all in, ( they do have comfortable sitting areas).  We spent approximately 1hour and saw most it had to offer."
24,4.0,"There are a few ways of getting atop the mountain to access the tower but the ways are not really explained or marked properly including the time it will take to reach the top. This is my second time hiking up the hill. This time I took the stairs which were packed and it it is around an hour to get to the top with a multitude of breaks for taking photos. The hike is moderate but those with knee pain might find it difficult. I wish we had taken the other hike, not up the stairs but we couldn‚Äôt remember how to get to it. The views were nice and sunset beautiful. We took the cable car down."
25,4.0,Best place to rest and enjoy the view of seoul. Full of light at night and many places to take photo
26,4.0,"Great views of the city. Not as tall as the Lotte Seoul Tower, but set up on a hill which gives it almost as much of a commanding view. Several coffee shops and restaurants as well as gift shops at the tower as well. Spend an hour for a quick look around or spend longer and enjoy the view while drinking coffee or grabbing a bite to eat."
27,5.0,What a superb view! This is the tallest building in S Korea and 5th in the world. The glass floor will give you a fright and if you are brave enough you can walk out onto the floor and have your picture taken. Looking straight down through the glass is amazing. On the floors at the base of the tower you will find restaurants. I thoroughly enjoyed this sightseeing excursion and did it at the beginning of my trip. From the observation floor you will get a 360 degree view of Seoul.
28,5.0,"Despite it being extremely windy from the typoon, we still had a good visit. Amazing views. We had lunch at the restaurant which was amazing. You cant beat dining with a view like that. And for something different definitely use the toilet facilities, it's worth it."
29,4.0,"It's a popular place for both tourists and locals. Especially,at night, many tourists go there to look around the Seoul city with the beautiful light."
30,4.0,A new style of getting out and about.  Very interesting place .never seen anything like it..enjoyed very much
31,5.0,"I love Seoul, Koreaüá∞üá∑. N Tower gives a breath taking view of Seoul. It has the ""locks"" bridge, souvenir shops, cafes, Hello Kitty shop, cable car ride. Can't wait to see this place again."
32,5.0,"I wanted to see this communication tower as it is on the Lonely Planet's Ultimate Travel list.  The Seoul City Tour company took us to see this tower as part of their N Seoul Tower, Hanok Village and Korean War Memorial morning tour.  This tower has very nice landscaping and gardens which I enjoyed walking through on the way to the tower.The view through the windows are hazy as the quality of air is not great in Seoul.  The most fun was the view from windows in the toilet cubicles in the ladies room, as it was the same as the main observation viewing windows.  I also liked the padlocks on the deck of a lower area.  (Borrowed this idea from the Paris bridge.).  In all a pleasant way to spend an hour."
33,4.0,Nice view at the top! Stayed there for longer than expected! Very good experience and easy to redeem redeem
34,4.0,"My second visit to N Seoul Tower was tons more comfortable than my first one as I didn't have to spend hours finding my way to the tower (brief recap: we got lost, walked for almost an hour, and ended up riding a bus). This time, we rode a bus and alighted at the tower's lower entrance, which meant that we had to hike uphill to reach the ground floor of the tower. It was a bit of a climb but it provided for a beautiful view of the tower and its picturesque landscape. We arrived just before sunset so everything was highlighted with a gorgeous golden hue background. We were fortunate for clear skies during our observatory tower visit; however, the views you get as you climb uphill or descend downhill prove to be more breathtaking than the one you get on the tower."
35,5.0,"I have to say that I have a profound love for korea so coming to the famous N tower was a must. The view is just magnificent and there are many places to take cool pictures. If you go in cold weather seasons go well covered because if chilly up there. Also I don't think is necessary for you to pay the ticket to go up in the tower, the magic is outside. Is crowded as hell too and it took ages for me to leave the place so i would definitely recommend you to just go to the outside part, the pictures inside aren't good anyways because of the glass. Stay outside."
36,3.0,"This is the best place for Seoul city night views. However, the waiting time for the cable car is quite long as it is crowded with locals and tourists. Overall, it is worth a visit if you enjoy night views.p.s. speaking personally, I think that paying to go up to the viewing tower is not really worth it as it is not much differences."
37,4.0,"We rode a bus going up the peak. It was a busy day in Namsan Tower..When the bus reached the parking lot, you still have to walk about 10 minutes in a steep slope to climb to the tower itself..The place was full of people and stuffs being sold.. We were told it was nice to go up the tower in their observatory but we didn't.. There are toooo many people and very loooong lines.. If you want to go up you need to be early or stay longer.The old ""shed"" in the area has a sad story behind it, ask your tour guide (if you have one) because im not spoiling..There is an outside observatory deck which they call the love locks deck with scopes that will aid you to view the entire Seoul Landscape..And speaking of love locks, they are literally everywhere..In the park, near the tower, on the observatory, and you can find love lock trees..You can buy one if you want to leave locks there.The view is spectacular, and even more beautiful with sunset and evening."
38,4.0,"After getting off bus no 5, you have to walk 5-10 mins of upwards landscapes to reach the N Seoul Tower. You can talk a few photo of it‚Äôs famous lover lock on the wall. And you can take close up look of N Seoul Tower. You need to buy entrance ticket to go up to the Tower. The view is good and worth a visit. I attach the bus no and it‚Äôs route . So you can know which places for your next stop. Hope I can know the bus schedule so I don‚Äôt need to wait that long for the bus."
39,4.0,"We kind of got a bit lost going up there because we had a misunderstanding with the bus driver. So we took the cable car instead and fortunately it was not crowded and the ride up was nice.You had to wait for a while for the elevator though, but the view was really good. You get a 360 degree view of the city lights. There were lots of food stores below too if you get hungry. And of course the there was the famous love lock. Definitely worth a visit."
40,4.0,"I feel like a trip up the Namsan Tower is a highlight of visiting Seoul. However, make sure you are prepared to spend a long time waiting. There is a wait if you want to take the Omni elevator to the cable car station (or you can choose to walk up the stairs like we did), there is a wait to buy your ticket for the cable car, there was a 40 minute wait after that to get on the cable car, and then you have to walk up more stairs and buy your ticket for the tower and wait for 30 minutes until it is your turn to get in line and wait to go up in the elevator. The view from the top was beautiful. We had hoped to go up while it was still light and watch the sunset, but it was dark by the time we made it to the top. The only downside of this is that the lights inside the tower reflect on the glass so you can't take pictures of yourself and see the city very well. There is also a 30 minute wait to go back down the elevator. We did enjoy the view from the deck at the base of the tower and got some good sunset pictures."
41,5.0,"There are many beautiful spots to see on the way leading to the tower. There are the Locks of Love which are posted in and around the various fences of this area. You can even buy your own padlock and leave a message on it and then lock it onto a post or wherever there was space. There is also a kids play area, stores for souvenirs or snacks, obviously the observation tower, statues and figures to take pictures of, and many rest stops along the way. Although the observation tower is a good view of the surrounding area, you can also get the view when just looking from the view point areas from outside the tower which is free."
42,4.0,You can get great views from here but during peak times of the year it does get overcrowded. But definitely worth going to at least once
43,5.0,Arrived the N Tower with our group after our great lunch in the financial district of Seoul.What a spectacular 360 degree view of the city. Luckily we were able to watch an endorsement photo shoot by a well known K-Pop artist  of a Nissan Car.  We have wonderful tour of the city that day.
44,5.0,"Stupidly I agreed to walk with my friend from Myeongdong to N Seoul Tower. It took an hour but don't worry, there are several buses which go to the top. Out of the 3 towers you can have a view of Seoul, this is the cheapest and buying from Klook is 40% cheaper. N Seoul Tower has a great view of Seoul, especially of Myeongdong. There are several activities you can do - have a photo taken with a green screen and insert different backgrounds, send a postcard from the observatory deck or have a coffee or meal. The men's toilet has a great view as well."
45,4.0,"We were lucky we visited on a good weather, and we could see the views clearly. The toilet cubicle is so interesting too, with a big mirrow reflection in front of toilet seat and the glass panel at the side of it, so we could either look out to the view outside or look at ourselve in the mirror."
46,3.0,Good view of Seoul but mostly building. Went up observatory and came down to the car within 30 minutes.
47,4.0,"The N-Seoul tower is located close to the town centre and so provides a great vantage point to see ‚Äògreater‚Äô Seoul and gain an appreciation of its size.  We visited during the day and (apparently) were fortunate in that the air was relatively clear,  which allowed us to see more than is normally the case.  Nevertheless the atmosphere seemed misty and objects in the distance are observed in a haze.At the base of the tower is an open area with a small shopping complex and open space which was busy with families and tourists.  There was also a small market which according to our guide was unusual. Access to the tower us by a pair of lifts which were not busy so we didn‚Äôt wait long to get to the viewing platform.  This is on two levels, the upper having an external area.  Souvenirs and snacks are available including a self serve sweet shop which was very popular.Well worth a visit and I imagine the night time view would be even more spectacular."
48,3.0,"it's a nice tower, but personally not a must place to visit. facilities is good, the view the the tower is great, but since this is no Iconic thing you can see from the Tower, so make it less interesting. T"
49,5.0,"Great views of the city all around. Take the Namsan cable car from the Hoehyeon-dong platform to Yejang-dong platform at the top of Mt Namsan near the N Seoul Tower. The cable car is about 605m meters up hill over the road & forest with scenic views of Seoul below.  You then exit and walk up to the Tower level where they have many gift & food shops. From here you can buy tickets to go up and view the city, hopefully it'll be a clear day so you can see North Korea in the distance. Interestingly around the observatory are the names of many world cities with the distance to each one, depending which direction you are facing. The atmosphere is one similar to going up the CN Tower in Toronto but with the added excitement of actually doing it in Korea. The city is truely amazing & full of life."
50,5.0,"We were here on a tuesday afternoon and it was perfect. Stunning view over the entire city. The cable cart cost about 10,000 won, and so did the entrence to the observation deck. The restaurant on the observation deck is very pricey, but there is a great Italian restaurant on first floor with an AMAZING view."
51,3.0,"We were advised on which bus to take.  The view at the foot of the tower was beautiful.Bought ticket up to Observatory floor on 5th floor which included lunch at Hancock restaurant, cost 50,000 won altogether.  The view was nothing special."
52,4.0,"The views from the tower were amazing! The walk up the hill to the cable was not but it‚Äôs South Korea and its mountainous. I highly recommend getting a combo ticket. My friend and I got one that included two tickets up the tower, two popcorns (1 regular flavour and 1 special flavour ‚Äî we chose caramel) and two drinks all for 22,000KRW. A single ticket up the tower for an adult was 10,000KRW so if you are with someone, get the combo, it‚Äôs such a good deal!"
53,4.0,"Went here because I skipped it my past 2 visits to Seoul. It was quite a hike from Myeongdong to the cable car station to bring us up the tower (I forgot how much but around 9000 won roundtrip), but it‚Äôs manageable. After getting off the cable car, you can already see colorful ‚Äúlove locks‚Äù all over; you can place your own. (If you don‚Äôt have a lock they sell it there.) You can also take photos of the Tower from that area. Then there is an option to pay to get up the N tower itself. Since we didn‚Äôt want to eat another buffet meal, we only got the tickets with pizza and pasta meal for 2 (not at the top of the tower though), but the pizza especially was superb. At the tower itself, we didn‚Äôt need to stay long; 15-20 minutes was more than enough. It was fun to play the interactive booth game though, where you can say hi to people at the Busan tower. :)"
54,5.0,Good view on mointaintop. But the Seoul Tower is smaller than Tokyo Tower and Shanghai Tower and 101Taipei.
55,2.0,There are very few elevators. Once ypu get off the cable car it is nothimg but stairs. The veiw is beautiful but not worth the hike. Getting on and off the cable car there was nothing but stairs. Not sings letting us know. There is an elevator from the main road to the cable car stand. If yoi have no mobility issues it is worth the trek. If you have mobility issues best to stay clear.
56,5.0,I went here wanting to go up to the top but it was a very hazy/polluted day so I don‚Äôt go to the top as you can walk around and see Seoul for free. Great views on a clear day!
57,3.0,"I came here because I saw how popular it was in the Korean drama. I was a little disappointed because I thought that the outside was the elevator that can go around to the top. Well, when you get inside, it's just an elevator that takes you to the top straight up, not go around like I thought it would be. It was nice, the view up there is beautiful. I went during Fall, so the leaves changing was nice to see. You can also eat and buy a lock to declared your love to each other."
58,3.0,"I've been to many tower view points in my tours (Seattle Needle, Eiffel Tower, the Empire State Building to name a few) and here it was a bit disappointing. We're reached the tower towards sunset to see the sun goes down on the city, but as the visibility was very poor due to the temperature and the atmosphere, we decided to check the tower itself. There is a deal for two at 22K W for two tickets + 2 drinks and 2 popcorn's (heavily stuffed with butter), and upon entering it looked very strange to the team there that we (as two tourists) didn't want to get ourselves pictured for an overpriced photo set (1 for 15K W and it goes on...)Once we reached up we discovered that it is almost impossible to get a clear sight in the night because of the merchandise and internal lights that these boots are reflecting. All the surrounding windows had reflection of everything you see inside (people shopping, lights of candy stores etc.) and you could not take a decent photo with those reflections. I guess during the day it is much better, but trying to compare the pictures shown by the staff of Seoul at night makes you wonder where was it taken (on the roof top of from a different building :))...."
59,2.0,"Maybe it‚Äôs Labor Day holiday so there were many people/tourists. From the bottom of slope waiting for elevator up to the ticket station , queuing to collect tickets, to go up the tower station and finally to top of tower was long long queue and we waited for almost 2-3 hrs. I did not think the night view was that fantastic, for the wait it was not worth it for me. We also queued an hr to wait for lift to go down. Bad experience, by the end of the night, my legs were aching so much. The staff there were not doing anything to make the wait more efficient. Maybe it is better if it is not public holiday."
60,5.0,I am thrilled to find cherry blossoms in here! Good place for sightseeing and picturetaking although most of the time there were too many tourist in here.
61,4.0,"Excited. While we were in line for the cable car, I thought it will only take us a few mins to hop in. Not really. If you want to take the cable car, it will be a very convenient journey to the top~But you'll have to wait more than 30 mins looping around before you can even hop in. I guess it's a lot better than walking all the way to the top? I wish they had a warning downstairs before getting the ticket that we will have more 30 mins wait. . We were excited for the sunset but we missed it... Oh well! The view was fantastic up there though!"
62,4.0,We visited the tower at night hoping for a great view. However it was foggy and we couldn‚Äôt see a thing. It was still a fun adventure!
63,3.0,"Unsure if it was the time we went but the lines were HUGE! We caught the elevator up to the cable car, the cable car up to the tower and then the elevator to the observation deck. There are quite a number of stairs and my poor Dad who has bad knees from an old sporting injury was hurting afterwards! It‚Äôs definitely a tourist trap, you get up to the observation deck, spend minimal time because it‚Äôs so crowded and then wait longer in the line to get back in the elevator to go back downstairs, it hardly seems worth it. Good to go once but wouldn‚Äôt be high on my priority list to go again."
64,5.0,This the best view point location from which all can gaze down on the whole city of Seoul.  But our best memories will be of the restrooms.   Restrooms were floor to ceiling glass and we got in trouble when there were women in the men's bathroom.  The men face out and the women face sideways......totally strange experience.....
65,5.0,On top of the tower one will be amazed by the size of this world city. It's just incredible.Really love to go here when I am in the city.
66,4.0,"This tower used to be among the tallest in Asia. Going to the tower itself would be a steep uphill climb . You will be rewarded with awesome views of the city before you enter this attraction.  The elevator going to the observatory point is a breeze, and is quite fast. But with many people converging with tour groups, it is hard to move around inside. We later had dinner one level below , and it is a buffet highlighting Korean cuisine. If you have time, it is worth spending time here. But avoid going down at the same time with other tourists, expect a long line in doing so.  Nice to take photos of the tower at daytime and night time."
67,5.0,A cheap morning or afternoon activity that‚Äôs allows you to appreciate the scale and density of the city that is Seoul.They run a tight ship here: you are up top in no time. I recommend booing via Klook and simply scanning your pass at a machine to print a ticket; saves a line up.
68,5.0,"This is a must visit place for couples, friends, families and even singles. The place is full of love lock and the stores sell all these items. Good to read what people write from all around the world. Lots of tourists and locals. Very good vibe."
69,5.0,"N Seoul tower is a great way of viewing Seoul. Cheap, very accessible thru bus or hop on hop off bus. We used our Seoul pass to enter.  There's a restaurant, gift shop and of course their observatory viewing floor. Try to use their washroom, even in there you will be enjoying the view. You can also rent hanbok and get your picture taken thru their photographer. I forgot how much is the picture but it's a reasonable price."
70,5.0,"We visited the Namsan Tower as part of a voucher deal we purchased. The walk up the mountain looked like a lovely and peaceful hike but not an easy climb therefore we took the easy route up via cable car. Visit early in the morning to avoid the crowds however the view can still be obscured by morning mist, so beware! During the time we were in the observatory the mist partly cleared therefore we were rewarded with wonderful views. The windows of the observatory tell you in which directly many cities are and the distance. However, we would of liked to have signs pointing out the Seoul landmarks, such as bridges etc as we spent time trying to find these.The love locks are a beautiful attraction. You don‚Äôt need lock you padlock as soon as you see the main bulk of them on the walk up as there are places to lock them all over the site.A must do activity when visiting Seoul!"
71,4.0,Nothing spectacular about the tower itself however on a clear day you can see all of Seoul and the surrounding areas and mountains. It is a must to visit the toilets which have a clear glass wall and a wonderful View.
72,5.0,We took the bullet elevator all the way to the observation deck and it lasted only 38 seconds or less. One would hardly feel it because there's a video showing on the ceiling while it's going up. The best part of being on the observation deck is the ladies' comfort room. One wall is entirely made of clear glass and you'll see Seoul while you use the commode. Weird but great experience! We were also able to do the lovelocks and it was fun!
73,4.0,"The second highest point in Seoul city, this tower provides a gorgeous view of the city at night. The observation deck at the top provides a dazzling cityscape from the glass windows and houses a souvenir shop. While exiting the tower, I also came across the row of Love Padlock trees and heart shaped chairs, which seemed to be quite popular with the couples visiting the tower."
74,5.0,Although the queue is quite long but on the top of the tower the 360 degree view is just fantastic! Beautiful place for sunset.
75,5.0,Very happy we made it to this attraction. We got here during sunset and it was great. Very busy though so beware of people
76,5.0,This could be a very romantic place to visit.  Views are great although it was extremely hazy on the day we visited.  Not sure how it looks at night but I bet its very nice.  You can hike up or take the cable car.  It‚Äôs definitely a worthwhile visit while in Seoul
77,5.0,"Seoul Tower or N Seoul Tower is one of the most romantic attractions that many couples have. The couple must come to lock the keys together. And also has a beautiful view point Have convenient travel The entrance fee is not expensive. People are friendly, cute and Has a very clean place."
78,5.0,"N Seoul Tower is one of the major tourist attractions of Seoul. Considered one of the most beautiful towers in Asia. Is a place that has beautiful and varied lighting. There is a restaurant on the tower that will turn around every 48 minutes, named N Grill. When going up to the tower to see the beautiful scenery."
79,4.0,I love the cable car ride to the top of the mountain. I love the magnificent view of Seoul from the mountain. The tower is interesting and sell many things from food to souvenirs
80,4.0,"Overlooking Seoul at N seoul tower despite the very cold weather the place, the view,the scenery was beautiful. There were restaurants as well to chill out until night-time. And couples lock their ""padlock of love"" onto the railing and to dream that their love will last forever."
81,3.0,"I visited Seoul tower with my friends. It's just the view from the tower. But due to glass reflection, was not able to click good pics. Just an average place."
82,5.0,"We went there at night.....It was a freezing night, we took the cable car (1-2 min ride). When we got there, we saw the whole city and the night view is absolutely beautiful!!!! Highly recommend to all travellers, you should visit at least once in your life time! P. S. Some souvenirs shop there u can buy some postcards, ‚Äòthe couple locks‚Äô thing...also, restaurant and cafe...."
83,5.0,"From Hyatt Hotel you can hike going up the tower, there is a road not frequently taken but if you love nature you will like the view...30min -1hr hike depending on your pace.  It is best to bring water and wear proper hiking clothes. The 800m mark going left and 1400m mark going right was confusing, so in between we walked up where you will see a small trail near a house...just use gps, and follow direction where the tower is."
84,3.0,"This is one of those obligatory attractions in any city you visit to get a bird's eye view of the city & its layout. Visiting in Feb when the temperature stayed below 5 degC meant we needed to take the cable car up. It was a good experience, and not too expensive. Surprisingly, there was quite a number of visitors but it wasn't very crowded. So the cafe and various F&B places were comfortable.The only issue is that the windows were not fully clean and so it was impossible to get a good selfie picture, or any good pictures for that matter."
85,5.0,Visited Seoul tower at nite and presented with delightful displace of light show bathing the tower and lights from surrounding structures down below. Mesmerising!
86,5.0,"This is definitely a must-see attraction at night. This is no doubt about it. The views are just stunning, amazingly colorful and bright. But be aware that you when you take the cable car, the price does not include the observation deck of the N Seoul Tower. It‚Äôs only less than USD$10, but I thought I was getting a packaged deal when purchasing my cable car ticket."
87,5.0,"This is a wonderful place from which to view Seoul. We enjoyed strolling the grounds, taking in the views, trying some virtual reality, seeing all the love locks, and then taking the elevator up the tower. Do make a reservation if you want to eat at one of the two 'real restaurants' otherwise you can get a wonderful burger or coffee/dessert at one the self-serve type spots. Walking down the path at night was lovely--seeing the city lit up at night was just beauriful. Not exactly accessible for those with mobility challenges."
88,4.0,"I love that N Seoul Tower has some seemingly random combo tickets. A trip up the tower with pizza and beer anyone?It made the experience more fun and it did seem like you got more bang for your buck. Like most of these kinds of attractions (Empire State Building, CN Tower, Space Needle, Venice's Campanile) it is way more crowded than you might be led to believe from pictures, movies etc... but I still think it was worth it. The atmosphere at night was fun and the views were gorgeous."
89,5.0,"Had a great trip to N Seoul tower. We walked all the way to Shinsegae mall, turned left, and walked about 5 mins, we took the elevator provided. Because it was freezing so we gave up walking up the hill all the way to the tower.. we took the cable car instead. The view was spectacular especially during the winter. We brought our own keypad lock because they‚Äôre selling for much a higher price at the tower.  Overall, the experience was great and we enjoyed it."
90,4.0,The view overlooking Seoul is better at sunset. The tower in itself is more impressive at night with all the lights. Take the Namsan cable up to have the full experience. :)
91,4.0,A mixture of colorful love keys and skies made it nice picture. Get cable car (recommended return-way) to get there. do not forget to try yummy hot fish-cake in the winter time on the way back...
92,2.0,"I‚Äôm not quite sure what all the fuss is about. We had to do an uphill walk to the base of the cable car for $10 each, then pay another $10 each to go up the observatory which essentially gives you a city view not unlike any other big cities. Lots of stairs and walking, not worth the effort."
93,5.0,"The Seoul Tower is an absolute must, particularly at night! It gives you a 360 degree view of the city with its brilliant twinkling lights. The signs that indicate what cities lay in which direction are helpful in establishing your spot in the world. It's a treat!"
94,4.0,"Great view of the whole of Seoul but not much to do up in the tower for the price we paid (W10.000). Nevertheless, it was still a nice experience. I would recommend going up half an hour before sunset so that one can catch the view of Seoul both in the day and night view. There‚Äôs also a postbox and postcards and stamps sold in the tower so that you can write and send postcards from the top of Seoul ;)"
95,3.0,"I went here with a couple of my local friends, the queue though omgosh. We went there around 7pm and the queue was superrrr long. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm gonna revisit. The view at night is nice but I won‚Äôt spend Another hours standing in long queue like that for just looking at Seoul‚Äôs view at night."
96,5.0,N Seoul Tower is an excellent place to visit with family and friends for any occasion because offers a great view day and night to the city of Seoul. The Tower is on top of a mountain and allows the opportunity to go for a walk and observe a large forest around the mountain plus having a delicious treat before going to the top of the Tower. Once on top of the Tower you can take some pictures of the city and buy some souvenirs.
97,4.0,Visited this place as part of a tour package and spent about 1 hour here. The view from Seoul tower is amazing and we were lucky as it was a clear day. The elevator had a nice ceiling video while bringing us up and down. Worth a visit if you are nearby.
98,5.0,"I personally think the visit is worth the price. Had a hotel in Myeongdong, so all I had to do was to take a lift to the cable car place.You should visit when the sun is setting, so you'll see Seoul during night, dusk and day. The inside of the tower is really crowded during that time though.You can send postcards directly from the tower, which I recommend."
99,5.0,"There is a currency exchange machine located behind the Twosome Coffee and beside the restroom.Reminder:You need to bring your passport because they will scan it for the limit amount you can only exchange. (I don‚Äôt actually know how they do this. Wow Korea)The rate is higher than the ones we found at the Incheon International Airport. (i.e. 939/939.50 Airport, 100.05 N Seoul Tower)"
100,4.0,Nice place to visit and one of the main attractions in Seoul. Staff are friendly and helpful. From the top of the tower you can get 360 degree view of the city. Love locks is a common couple activity here. N Seoul Tower is mainly used as a broadcast and communications tower.
101,5.0,"I recommend doing this in the evening, you see the whole of Seoul lit up! It‚Äôs an amazing view, definitely worth seeing"
102,3.0,"Driving here. Car park goes 3/4 way up to the hill to the Lookout .This has a tower atop.. but the ‚Äúfree to look‚Äù version was adequate to us.A 360 * of Seoul.. the view from the tower should  be more far reaching, but it was misty,cloudy thus,couldn‚Äôt be bothered to go up!Yes , it was a view of the city, 4pm, so it wasn‚Äôt a striking sight, as there were no lights to hi-lite the scene.A  ‚Äúpadlock‚Äùfence, where U purchase a p/lock( costs money) and add to the collection of numerous others,who were expounding undying love to someone,( NOT ME!)There were movie characters, and others for foto shoot opportunities.Food and souvenirs were available for purchase?  Toilets available (free)To me... it was a BEEN THERE DONE THAT!!  As friend said,brought us here because it was expected!Came at wrong time, don‚Äôt know if open at nite?How long the visit depending upon the individual.. me.. twenty mins  enough,Wheel chair access would be difficult because of the uphill push, and downhill hold."
103,3.0,"an ordinary experience apart from the extraordinary view of the city, the restaurant is not at the price and everything was too commercial, starting from the padlocks of the lovers. I bought a beautiful t shirt"
104,5.0,"We got the tickets that included the meal in the Hancook Restaurant. The view was great and the food was excellent. Even when you‚Äôre in the toilet, the view was great! It‚Äôs a bit pricey but I think it was worth it."
105,4.0,"The place to go to see Seoul city from a higher view point. The grounds where the tower base itself is located is already high enough to see great views of Seoul, however you could also go up the tower for an unobstructed 360 view.Recommend going in the evening as the sun is about to set to see both views when it is still light and as the lights fill the city as the night darkens."
106,3.0,"This place is famous for korean drama shooting, many korean drama take shooting on this place... tons of lock key here etc... nice view of Seoul... there‚Äôs souvenir shop here..."
107,4.0,"Went with a friend last night and have to say that this place offered a stunning view of Seoul. They've also decent souvenir shops and love locks for the couples to hang up overlooking the city. We took the cable car going down and have to say while it was quick, it was awfully crowded. We didn't have to wait long at 9 pm but even then, everyone had their bodies pressed up against each other and save for those on the sides of the cable cars or those who are taller than most, we couldn't get to enjoy the view it offered. Still, it's well worth a visit."
108,5.0,This is good place for any type of tourists but there is a special place for lovers. There is place where you could buy suveniours and another place where you could buy a lock and place it on a place and lock it for your partner or lover.
109,5.0,"If you go to Namsan Tower on the weekend, u‚Äôll see a lot people there. I recommend u to come here at fall, because the weather‚Äôs good and the view really good!~Untuk mencapai Tower nya bisa naik cable car atau jalan kaki ya. Tahun lalu aku jalan kaki, dan jujur sangat melelahkan jadi ga aku saranin hehe~"
110,4.0,"There are two ways to get to N Seoul Tower ‚Äî via cable car or by foot. We went for the latter. It was less than 10 degrees but we were sweating haha I lost track of how many stairs there was but it took as approximately almosg an hour to reach the destination. Although it was very tiring (like really, our legs were so sore after) but the view while on our way is breathtaking. You can see the beauty of Seoul at night. As of November 2018, the cable car costs 9,000KRW round trip or 7,000KRW one way. Either is ok, depends on you and your time."
111,5.0,"Even though it was a very hot day, the view from the top was breathtaking. Beautiful sight of Seoul at night. Long wait for the cable car to go up (Sat nite) and we decided to walk down after. Overall its worth it. Don‚Äôt miss this if you are in Seoul!"
112,4.0,"We climbed from the foot to the top, it‚Äôs a pleasant walk though may be steep and strenuous for some. The path is well paved and there‚Äôs handrails on the side.There‚Äôs a love locks area for lovers to ‚Äúlock‚Äù their love there. Nice place for photo taking and crowded too. Though we didn‚Äôt go up the N Seoul Tower, we managed to get a bird‚Äôs eye view of the surroundings. We could see our hotel in Myeongdong and the coloured leaves around.Well worth the effort to climb!"
113,5.0,Great view who wants to see the beauty of Seoul. Every corner on the tower is picture perfect. Will be back here as soon as possible!
114,5.0,"The scenery was beautiful, from the walkway to the top of the tower to the toilet. You can also enjoy the view while peeing :)  I like this place, I wish we had time to stay a little bit longer to enjoy the view."
115,4.0,"Went with an elderly relative. There were about 30 stone steps to climb, but otherwise quite accessible. We got the free venicular train, then the cable car and finally the lift. Although costly, the views were wonderful. Thete was also a demonstration of Korean traditional soldier training in the square by the tower, all wearing traditional costumes and using traditional weapons.Back to the tower, there views were marvellous on the day we visited, bot I can imagine that on a wet or cloudy day they would be very limited. We did have to queue for a long time to get in the lifts and on the cable car, so leave plenty of time."
116,4.0,"Perfect place to get a nice view of Seoul while also enjoying a good hike. We spent 4 hours exploring the area, going up on the tower and taking lots of pictures. We went there around 3pm and it was busy but not suffocating. Include it in your travel plans if you want a good hike (going up to the tower on foot, not by cable car) with nice views of the city."
117,5.0,"A friend and I climbed the stairs all the way to the tower base and went up to the observation deck. It was a beautiful day and Seoul was bright with fall colors. There was a nice gift shop, places to eat, opportunities to purchase and leave love locks, and a quintessential Korean atmosphere. We did take the cable car down! A definite highlight of my visit to Seoul!!"
118,5.0,"N Seoul tower is quite good to go as a tourist. One suggestion is after you finished, please hike and walk to Nam San Park. The park is extremely beautiful !!! And after it, you can walk to nam dae mun market to eat."
119,4.0,"Excellent viewpoint, to get a away from the hassle of the city. A couple of refreshment points and restaurants up there"
120,4.0,"i have been visited N Seoul Tower for two times.  people can see the busy city from the top of the tower, people can take a walk from the well built mountain tracks from tower back to entrance.  i tried to walk with my friend once in March, there were cherry blossoms along the track, very beautiful and leisure"
121,5.0,"Worth visiting as part of the city tour. Great views of the City all round and for photographers, great landscape shots can be taken from various angles. It does get a bit crowded but that‚Äôs only because it‚Äôs a great location."
122,5.0,"What a great place for tourists and dates.  The combination of these two make N Seoul Tower a must visit during your time in Seoul.  I would especially recommend going around sunset.  As a tourist, I was able to experience Seoul culture because locals actually come here to spend time with each other and add to the collection of tens of thousands of locks that are clipped to fences and rails around the summit.  There are also restaurants and stores.  If you come with a loved one and are thinking ahead, bring your own lock.  Otherwise you can buy one in vending machines or the store.  Highly recommend this experience!"
123,5.0,The hike up to the tower was well worth it. Even if you don‚Äôt go up the tower there is a lot to do in the landing area. There are plenty of restaurants and gift shops in the landing area. I did not take the cable car up because the line was very long but I here it‚Äôs a unique experience.
124,5.0,We walked from our hotel. Got to a very steep hill to climb up and some stairs to get to the cable car. We waited for 30mins to get the cable car and then 90 mins to get into the tower to go up. The view from the top was worth it. An enjoyable evening.
125,4.0,Great spot to see the whole landscape of Seoul! They also have their most known teddy bear museum to visit and little memorabilia to brought home. Definitely a must visit if you're in Seoul!
126,5.0,"We went there quite late in the evening. A Korean friend guided us through alleys and we took the cable car up to the observation deck. The car can fit a large number of people so even if you have to wait, do not lose patience. We waited for about 10 minutes and our turn was up. The night view of the Han River, the busy city of Seoul with all the lights was worth seeing. I am not too sure how I feel about the locks that seems to be a trend with young couples but I am not judging. This was one of our most memorable night in Seoul. The place had a photo booth around the viewing deck. The three of us got in there and took some pretty crazy photos which were promptly sent to our email address including copies printed there. We felt like we made memories there."
127,4.0,"I would recommend walking up the trails through Namsan Park, so that you can enjoy the vistas of the Seoul fortress city wall against the towering buildings. Enroute the way to the top, you will also pass by the beacon hills which was used for communication with smoke signals in the olden days. There was renactment of the guards patrolling the fortress and opportunity to wear the traditional Korean costumes. At Seoul tower - a popular filming location for K drama fans - many locks have bedn fastened to whatever available space around the tower. It is accessible from cable car and it s worth going up there for the vistas of Seoul city"
128,4.0,Good views of Seoul. Take the public bus there. It‚Äôs easy and cheap. Shouldn‚Äôt take longer than and hour or 2 to roam around and check out the views of the city. Worth it to kill a couple hours
129,5.0,"N Seoul Tower is a landmark of Seoul because you can pretty much see it from everywhere. And it's just so beautiful! I had the advantage of staying at a hotel with a terrace that was faced right at the tower and every night seeing it was like magic, along with all the city lights. The view from its top is also very beautiful, too bad that we were there on Chuseok and the crowd and huge lines of waiting were exhausting. But still, I do recommend visiting it."
130,5.0,I like namsan tower but i think the cable car is not worth it. You can go there just by walking and have a good view of nature. You can enjoy many things in namsan tower. Just don‚Äôt enter to the hello kitty museum. It‚Äôs not good.
131,5.0,Took the 1200m ascent and it was a lot of calories burned. So I think. Bring water. There's a vending machine and convenience store and a burger place when u reach the top. Great view of the city during daytime. Even better view at night.
132,5.0,Waiting time for Namsan cable 45mins-1hr but worth it once you reach the top to N Seoul Tower. The view is awesome & there are performances like magic show & martial arts in the afternoon just before the lights of the whole Seoul turns on...wonderful!!!
133,3.0,"If you are staying in Seoul, you need to go here to get a great 360 degree view of Seoul. But beware, there are always a lot of people there!"
134,3.0,Crowded but worth the time to visit..U can buy Ur lock before coming up the cable car coz it's cheaper than the shop upstairs
135,5.0,"i came here on April, it cherry blossom seasons. Nice place to sightseeing. you can enjoy  their nice view , a place you must visit when you came to seoul. You can go upstair by walking or cable car, for cable car you must pay 8000k won per roundtrip ticket."
136,5.0,"We were fortunate enough to experience snow when we were up there. This site is very nice and a must visit when you visit Seoul. We enjoyed the Bear Museum and the Observatory also. The love-locks bridge was very so we just take a peek and did not get much photos. All in all, it‚Äôs a must on your itinerary."
137,4.0,This tower is on the mountain Having laser show here and some restaurants around And it‚Äôs famous for couples to leave a lock with wish on the Net Weather is cold sometimes so don‚Äôt forget ur jacket
138,5.0,A cable car to the bottom of the tower was a great way to go and see the city. Views from the observation deck - amazing to see the size of Seoul. The locks on the fences and trees and everything else were a sight to see in themselves. Great parkland to enjoy and although busy has a peacefulness about it.
139,4.0,"Spent an hour here and enjoyed it a lot. Nice landscaped parkland with a central plaza with shops and restaurants. The views from the tower are stunning, make sure you go on a clear day. This place gets packed at the weekends so get there early."
140,5.0,"We went around 5pm so we could see the sunset from the top of the tower. Ended up getting the 22000won ticket set with popcorn and a drink each and were pleasantly surprised by the size of the popcorn bucket!The tower itself had excellent views, and lots of good little souvenirs. We sent a couple of postcards from the top which was a nice touch - hoping they make it home! All in all, reasonably priced for good views."
141,5.0,"Must go to N Seoul Tower, it's an amazing view once you get up there, lots of photos and videos you can take, there is a long line to get up there and back down, but it was worth the wait, otherwise you can walk but takes up to an hour and has alot of stairs."
142,5.0,The N Seoul Tower is awesome. There are great views to be seen. I highly recommend visiting this iconic place when in Seoul!
143,4.0,It is a cool place to just walk around. At the top of the tower you have the distances to most home countries. When I went you could get a free photo by playing a match the image game. We also took the regulars tower photo and they emailed us the jpegs of all the pics even though we only got a printout of one. At night everything is lit up and without paying this would still be a nice experience.
144,5.0,"It's just a standard observation tower with a gift shop and restaurant, but atop a small mountain. There is a 3-minute long cable car ride that takes visitors to and from the tower. The best time to visit is at night when the sky is dark and Seoul is lit up for amazing views."
145,5.0,"More than just a photo stop, accessible by cable car or drive with ease. Houses a nice Korean restaurant that is good to dine in. Views here are wonderful"
146,2.0,"Doing a tour of Seoul tower is to expensive and not worth it in my experience. The view is fun, but I would recomend Namsan tower instead. Also the place is crowded with tourists."
147,5.0,"We went for shopping though since this was my first time in Seoul we decided to do a little sight seeing. We checked into the Pacific Hotel and walked to the Tram entrance, a short hike directly behind our hotel. The tickets were $9 each for the tram ride up and once at the base of the tower, we purchased a ticket to the observation deck of the tower. Another $9 each. The tram ride offers a great view, though I was disappointed that it wasn't air conditioned. In case you haven't heard, summer and winter weather in Seoul is extreme! The park at the base of the tower is very nice with lots of areas to sit and enjoy the view, restaurants, a bar and shopping areas. The elevator ride to the top of the Tower is quick with a fun video to keep your mind off the quickness of the ride. The observation deck has a restaurant, a bar, a candy shop and plenty of shopping. It even offers a post office with lots of fun stationary for purchase. The lines to get up/down to the park and tower are long, though it is very organized. I would suggest adding another drink machine in the staging area to the tram. There is one right before you get to the stairs. It would have been nice to have a machine as you walk into this room."
148,5.0,Nothing really special but it is still entertaining! You can take a lot of nice pictures there and see wonderful places~
149,4.0,"Got the cable car, no queue when I was there, and got amazing views of Seoul. If you go into the Seoul Tower Plaza you can get almost 360 degree views without having to pay to go up the tower.  Well worth a visit but if you don‚Äôt make it during your trip then I wouldn‚Äôt worry."
150,5.0,"We went to the top @ night.  Restaurants require advance reservations and probably that you not be as bedraggled as we looked when we arrived after hiking Namsan on a hot & humid day...  :-DWorth seeing the view from the top, particularly at night.  Can get crowded."
151,3.0,"Locations in the highlands of Seoul, you can see the sights of Seoul from here, especially when looking at the Tower.  You can enjoy the view of Seoul from a highest place. Attention for time to visit, consider about backlight"
152,5.0,"As Namsan Seoul Tower is the symbol or the icon of South Korea, this place is worth to visit. It is very well known for its love locks hanging everywhere. You don‚Äôt need to buy tickets if you only want to hang your love lock there. You can also go inside the plaza to see around, take a picture and enjoy the food. You only need to pay if you want to go to the top of the tower and to take the cable car. Moreover, there is also a performance and you can enjoy it for free. For the lock, it is suggested to bring your own because it‚Äôs quite pricey there. Overall, Namsan Seoul Tower is worth to visit place."
153,5.0,A ride up in the large cable car is the start of a wonderul journey. Once you arrive at the viewing platform up the tower the 360 degree views are outstanding. Make sure you visit the bathrooms....its worth a look too. If you part with a few thousand won you can buy a Love Lock and leave it attached to the railings with your loved ones details on it...there are millions of love locks there üíú
154,4.0,"There is a very long steep climb up before you even get to the base to go up 4 flights of stairs and then the elevator to take u to the top. Once at the top the view is beautiful. There is a gift shop, a few food places and the fences with the locks. Alot of nice picture taking opportunities."
155,4.0,"Who knew that N Seoul Tower (or originally known as NamSan Tower) is the Eiffel Tower of Korea? That being said, don't be surprised in seeing the hundreds of couples that venture out here. If you take the elevator ride to the top, not only will you get to see the great cityscapes and beautiful scenery of afar but see millions of locks that couples have locked on to ""lock up their hearts"" for each other. It's pretty cool to see."
156,4.0,Nice place to view the city view of Seoul. Just take the cable car or walk up the trail to the top. Nice view!!!
157,5.0,"This is a great experience. The tower itself at night is mesmerizing.. couldn‚Äôt get enough of it.. the panoramic night view is so breathtaking.. the best time to visit is in the evening before sunset... i would recommend to get the single trip cable car ticket and walk down as there are more nice views along the way down..Besides, the cable car has very long queues going down.we bought a return cable car tickets but ended up walking down due to the long queue. Blessing in disguise... we enjoyed the walk in cool breeze and nice scenery."
158,4.0,worth going in a clear day.  You can see even the ancient buildings in Changdeokgung Palace and Gyeongbokgung Palace from just the lookout at the ground of the N Tower.  No need to go up the tower unless you want to enjoy a decent western meal there.
159,3.0,This was a nice place to take my sister visit but I think that it is overrated. The cable car was hot and crowded. You have workers trying to pressure you to take a picture to purchase before you can actually enjoy the tower. Don't expect anything spectacular.
160,5.0,"Great view and nice place, this place is good for group of friends and lovers. The place is full of love, very romantic theme and a 360 view for seoul korea."
161,4.0,You could get a sense of the direction and whole view of the city and the main rivers in the city. A very impressive view of the city.
162,4.0,"I went there twice, one during week day day time and another on weekend night. The week day day time was great, not too crowded with good view. On the weekend night it was really crowded and the wait was 40 minutes going up and 40 minutes going down. Not worthy! We didn't pay additional to go up the observation tower level since the base level offers a good view already.It's worthy going up there, but not on weekend."
163,4.0,"I had a two hour visit to the N-Seoul tower with a tour guide miss Sue Chung, a government certified English tour guide. N Seoul tower ‚Äì the highest point of Seoul - from where you can enjoy panoramic views over the city. You could find hello kitty museum onsite. The view from the top was panoramic. SEE photos."
164,5.0,The Namsam Tower is a must see destination when visiting Seoul. It has an amazing voew both day and night and most of all it is the perfect place to lock your love with your special someone ;)
165,2.0,"This is a far away tower, so you get to see the city but from far. I'm not a very big ""seeing big cities from above"" fan so for me the time to get there and the whole experience wasn't worth it.Lots of shops, some restaurants and it's located in a park, so that was particularly nice."
166,5.0,"We do enjoy the night scene from the top, but the strong wind is too cold so we keep stay in the building itself. Due to the strong wind , the cable car is stop operating and we do need to go to Seoul Tower by bus. It is quite convenient too. The most amazing part is the toilet , is a big see through glass window, you can enjoy the night scene while poo'ing or pee'ing."
167,4.0,"Went there on a Friday with really good air quality, so the sight was impeccable! The price of 10k Won is fair. The staff was absolutely bored, however no interaction is needed to enjoy the view..."
168,5.0,I reached the foot of the tower at night and the decks there offer a spectcular view. I couldnt go to the top as was part of a guided night  tour.  Next afternoon took the cable car to the foot and then bought a decently priced ticket to the observatory deck .. awesome view i reached at around 4 pm so it was a bit early. Would recomend going around 1900 (7pm) for best of both worlds day light and illuminated beauty of the city. And if the timing is right the sunset.
169,4.0,It was a fun hike up to Seoul Tower. It had some breathtaking views of the nearby mountains. It didn‚Äôt hurt they had a deal for tickets when I went.
170,5.0,"View from the tower is spectacular. Go on a day were the pollution is low and you can see forever, there is plenty to do and eat around the tower spend a half day there and it is well spent."
171,5.0,"I have been up many towers but this is one of the best. We used the cable car, which took no time at all. We went up in the evening and the atmosphere was amazing! It wasn‚Äôt expensive either compared to some others. I.e. Burj Khalifa, Dubai.It has food outlets, shops and a very happy, family feeling. Would highly recommend."
172,3.0,"The line to ride the cable car to get to the tower is so long, it took us approximately 2 hours. In the end, we only took pictures of the love locks and didn't go to the tower itself because it was so late by the time we went up. I don't recommend this if you don't have the patience for long lines. The view of the city from the top is also not spectacular."
173,3.0,"I happened to watch a few shows and videos introducing the tower. I suppose the experience of getting there would be cute and romantic, but it didn‚Äôt give me that feeling. We went during sunset and was able to see the night view of Seoul. However, I think it‚Äôs not a very good place to look over Seoul."
174,5.0,"it is like the iconic tower in seoul that u simply cant miss. i have been to there for like 2 times already, so i didnt go up the tower. it was nov and we missed watching sunset when we arrived. still a lovely and beautiful place to visit"
175,4.0,"A great view of the city and landscape. Noting the features from past and present. Very pleasant staff at all points of interest. The restaurant is pricey 120.00 for a steak dinner, great if you go in planning such.Walking down is worth the trip many more sights to see, points of interest and history of the wall and region."
176,5.0,"I've been there in first week of May... Nice weather and cool to visit there at that time... Located on Namsan Mountain and It's not that difficult to take bus to get there.... Terrible of long queue to take bus to get back down.. It's not worthy for 10$ to go up... But great place for the moment of Romantic time with your Love !! By the way, 10$ for pad locks that was sold as souvenir to lock up on the romantic area there..."
177,5.0,"A bunch of friends went up one fine morning to the tower. We took the cable car up and down, but recommend walking down - if not both ways. We also recommend going towards the end of the day to be able to see the view with both daylight and night lights popping up. Sunset view is amazing.Enjoy the walk and the view with a bunch of friends or your loved one. Worth it!"
178,4.0,"U could choose to take the elevator or walk up to the cable car station. We wanted to take the elevator but when it came to our turn, the elevator broke down. So we had to walk up. It wasn't too bad though. We rode the cable car up to the tower and reached in time for sunset!"
179,3.0,"We took a bus from up to N Seoul thinking we have reached. Much to our horror, there was still a steep slope of 15min in order to get to the tower. It did not help that the weather was so cold and getting up there made us out of breath! The elevator up to the observatory was cool and the view of the whole city was breathtaking. Unfortunately, we went at night, and all the window panes were full of fingerprints. The place was dimly lit with several bright spots from the souvenir store that made photo taking really difficult. Was told by a friend whom went in april recently to go in the day as it is the spring period and there are sakura everywhere to seen."
180,4.0,"Instead of getting a bus up like what other people seemed to be doing, we ended up climbing up the road through the park to get here. We were a bit rushed since we still had one more stop after the tower. We used the Discover Seoul pass for the entry ticket. There is a number on the ticket and you can only line up if your ticket number is within the range on display. While waiting you can get something to eat, shop for some souvenirs, or go look at a display like the Hello Kitty one by the ticketing area.The top had really nice views of the city. The glass had cities and their distance from the Tower which I thought was quite nice, particularly since Auckland was there. We somehow managed to get there for sunset which was quite nice.The plaza downstairs had plenty of shops and restaurants. Would've like to spend a bit more time to have a more thorough look at the area."
181,5.0,"Just got back from visiting Namsan Tower and Namsan Park. Get the cable car up (Or walk, but its quite steep!) and you'll get access to sweeping to the city skyline. Afterwards (or before hand like we did), take a walk around Namsan park. It's beautiful and full of colour."
182,3.0,Easy access via bus and namsan cable. Crowded with a good night view. Two spots for love locks photo taking. I prefer the one near the cable as its not so crowded.
183,4.0,Namsan Seoul Tower  was the first tower-type tourism spot in Korea. There are performances held here with traditional Korean dancing with swords they also have quite a good buffet restaurant.
184,4.0,We used the cable car back and forth from the tower. We went before it was too dark and got to the see the city lightning up. I think at night the view is more beautiful.
185,4.0,"The place was nice, we went there at night, (sorry but Taipei101 view was better on top) I just felt kinda disappointed when we were in the observatory, but the padlocks outside are everywhere! I recommended taking the cable car to be there, but there are just too much walking you have to do that you must wear rubber shoes, no to heels!"
186,3.0,"Reaching here can take up to 5 minutes walking from the bottom, along the way you're surrounded by gardens. During my visit above you can see shops, Korean in traditional clothes, love locks and of course kindesses of Korean people :)The love locks itself is the most famous part here together with the view from above. The view at afternoon is just average so I think visiting at evening will be better as the tower lights is on with the city view at night. Visiting here as couples will be very nice, guaranteed."
187,5.0,We enjoyed the opportunity to walk the last part of the trail to the tower and enjoy the cherry blossoms.The tower gives just what you would expect - great views in all directions. It was the first real opportunity for us to realise the density and spread of this city.
188,5.0,Basically it is paradise made for couples. Nothing special just bunches of lockes. But the scenery is especially good at afternoon to night
189,5.0,"My friends and I really enjoyed hiking upto the tower. Only took us about 1,5h. Nice trails and then great views when reaching the tower."
190,5.0,"One of the romantic place in Seoul where many couples like to lock up the keys together. We saw the view of Seoul, It's pretty much and  good luck that snow falls.It make us feels very romantic although it was very cold too. Good memories to visit here"
191,2.0,I can‚Äôt tell that the view is bad. I mean of course we can see Seoul from a very high point but the night I visited the tower it was foggy (bad luck) The thing that I didn‚Äôt like was mostly about the organisation of the visit. First of all you have to wait 10 minutes for a lift that can take 15 people max and then once you arrived up at the entrance you‚Äôll have at least to wait for 1 hour or 2 jours. You have to wait standing because there is a few sits. Then once you are up in the tower you have once again to wait for 1 hour to come back downstairs. Consequently we literally waited 3 jours for a 10 minutes panoramic view. I found this not worth it.
192,5.0,"You have to take the cable-car to go to Namsan Tower, and then pay more to go up to the observatory. It's all worth it though, especially just before sunset, so you can see the sun set over the city, which is very pretty. You can also purchase postcards up in the observation deck and post them straight away, international too. I even received mine, though a month late. The view was spectacular, giving a 360 degree view of Seoul. It's a must visit."
193,5.0,This place is a must to visit in Seoul. You will see a Seoul view from a tower. I took the cable car to the tower which was very convenient. There are many spots that you can take a nice shot.
194,4.0,Went up at night and the view was beautiful. Walked on the transparent walkway which was an experience. Nice way to see the city of Seoul
195,5.0,The glass floor was a fun way to see the city. Even though it was a bit scary but a good way to view the city
196,4.0,"Its good place to go if you go seoul, dont walk go go here, the have something like cable car availabe, paid 8500 per person to return way. Romantic place with populer lock things and tower, have good store too. But too cold here if you come when winter season"
197,5.0,"I went there in december !!! It was supposed To be cold but because we  walked a lot, It was warmer ^^ I think if we go non, we  can enjoy spring !!!"
198,3.0,View from the tower is average. View of tower itself is better. All souvenirs are extremely expensive compared with other places in Seoul. Here can be visited with last priority if time is limited.
199,4.0,It is best to go there at night because the view is very nice. You can skip Observatory because the best view is in outside. The place are also nice. There's so many restaurant or coffee to choose if you get hungry or have a coffee break. We took a bus going to Tower to skip the line in Cable car and its not tiring.
200,4.0,"It was not a very clear day, but from the top you appreciate how expansive Seoul is. There are great vantage spots for pictures and of course selfies."
201,5.0,Great place. Enjoyed the hike to and from the tower. Amazing view from the observation tower. There is post office on the too that sells really nice post cards.
202,5.0,Super enjoy the overlooking view at the N Seoul Tower from riding to cable car to roaming the area.  We bought colorful padlock and put out name on it the lock in the designated area at N Seoul Tower.  Its good to visit during the sunset and night to see the lighting city of Seoul..
203,5.0,"When you go there, there are some shops you can‚Äôt miss. Moreover, there is one beautiful Starbucks.Next to the tower, you can find a beautiful place with some love lockers. Well ¬´¬†some¬†¬ª = A LOT. You should go there during the sunset."
204,3.0,It was a grey day and the view therefore was not the best. Still worth a trip to see how huge Seoul spreads. Nice view even from the toilet :-) would prefer to have a section without a window but free for pics
205,5.0,We went there last Feb and it was a freezing cold night. At the observation deck we were able to send postcards from the Namsan Tower
206,5.0,"My friends and I decided to walk from Myeondong Shopping District to the cable station of N. Seoul Tower. We did not look for the bus and just decided to walk. The line for paying for the cable car ride and even the line for riding the cable car were really long. I recommend tourists to be patient or to come early or may be to allocate longer time in visiting this place. Despite of long waiting period we spent, it was worth it. The place is just so beautiful and romantic. We ate in the restaurant in the area before indulging ourselves to picture taking sessions. We decided not to buy a love lock but we enjoyed taking our photos in the site. Since it is in the mountain expect for a colder temperature especially at night. Bring extra jacket with you. If you are a K-Dram fan, then this place is a must for you since a number of drama series were shoot N. Seoul Tower from My Love from the Star to the Legend of the Blue Sea."
207,5.0,We enjoyed our time in n seoul tower. Been there with friend. Can see seoul from the tower. A must visit. Hello kotty  is a good place for children they will loveit
208,4.0,"Located on the top of the hill with a beautiful view and one of the most favorite place for dating (though my friend said not anymore). And yet i'm curious to see the love chair and stuffs that appear on the drama, LOL. I visit there to enjoy the sunset and quite crowded in peak season. We take our time strolling to the top and take cable car to get off. The cable car queuing was insane ha3 but no choice since it was chill outside. Don't forget to visit the toilet at top, you can see fantastic view from the most unusual place, I mean it !"
209,5.0,"It opens late and offers amazing view of the city. We mapped it and ended up taking the bus and hiking to the tower. The hiking trail was well lit, clean and we'll maintained. It was an easy and good hike, however I wouldn't recommend doing it at night like us as it was a little spooky because there was no one. The other (more expensive, less time consuming) option is to take the cable car.  There are some restaurants at the tower. It wasn't too crowded when we were there and city views are always amazing (even the bathrooms has views). We paid (10,000 krw each if I'm not mistaken) only to enter the observatory however, there are other packages available. While exiting, there are lots of love locks along the pathway and 'trees'. If you wish to leave one behind, do bring your own!"
210,5.0,"Stunning views of Seoul from the observation deck - its a must see in my opinion!! We took the bus from Myeongdong to the base of the tower, but there is also a cable car. There are a bunch of coffee shops and some food places around the base, we didn't try these as the few food places we looked at were expensive. Coffee totally reasonably priced. Cost 10000 for each adult to head up the tower for some beautiful views of the city. There is also a coffee shop and gift shop at the top. I would recommend waiting for a clear day and going up in plenty of time for sunset.There are awesome views from the base of the tower too, but I would definitely tell you to head up there!!"
211,3.0,"My friend and I didn't have a pleasant experience while waiting to buy tickets to get to the Seoul Tower. Many times we were cut in line by some group of people or a grandma holding a toddler. Then later on, the whole family cuts in with the grandma and toddler. Long story short, it took an hour plus to get in line to buy the tickets and then wait another 40 minutes to get on the cable car to the Seoul Tower. After we got up, we waited another 30 minutes to be seated at the noodle house. Everywhere was just waiting! It was a madhouse. The gift shop was packed like sardines. This was during a weeknight around 6:30-7pm. It was just impossible to navigate around. We were able to get a few shot of the tower, but that was it. We waited in line for the cable car to get back down. And of course, we were cut in line again. Somehow I think our forehead said ""Please cut in front of us!"" Overall, nothing special but just a tower with a lot of tourists."
212,4.0,"We were in town for only one night so one of the sights we wanted to see was the Seoul Tower and we were not disappointed. We're from NYC and this definitely reminded us the Empire State Building in many ways. It also featured a great burger joint, excellent vantage points of the temple and the space needle is simply exquisite."
213,5.0,This is a great place to go.  It is wonderful seeing the city and surrounding areas from on high.  I would highly recommend that you go on a clear day so that you can take full advantage of the view.
214,4.0,"many photo spot, love locks, try cable car. some snack bar available not so crowded. day and night available for visit"
215,2.0,It's not a place to visit with friends. If you are not a couple it will be very boring. The view is great but that's all. The products prices are a joke. VERY EXPENSIVE. Disappointed.
216,4.0,"Challenge yourself and go up through the winding stairs to appreciate the scene and the sights (of course, there is an option to take the tram going up or down).  The experience us also different when you do it late afternoon or evening as you get to see the lights. Trivia - there is a wall situated along the footpath that has a historical meaning (more than the locks near the tower) :)Tips: wear comfortable shoes, queus can be really long, stay hydrated and bring some snacks"
217,4.0,"If you like climb but not too difficult and want to have a wonderfil view on Seouol, this is the venue to visit day time or night time, both is good. The best is to catch the sunset depending on season, you might take some amazing shoot of Seoul."
218,5.0,The view is amazing at night and would definitely recommend coming at night when the city lights up. Lots to do and wander around even if you don't want to check out the Observatory. We didn't go up and still enjoyed the amazing view and checked out the different shops at the base of the tower.
219,4.0,This is just one option if you're looking for lookouts over Seoul. Other buildings include the Lotte Sky Tower at Jamsil or the Seoul 63 Building. Otherwise not bad and worth the visit.
220,4.0,It gives you a good view of the city. I think the view at night is better compared to day time. Can easily take the Bus #5 from Myeongdong and then walk up a bit to the tower. Found out that the colour of the tower depicts the quality of air in Seoul. Blue is the best quality.
221,3.0,Having a great expectation of this place since it's very popular on korean drama lol but ends up with just okay place. It's not that bad but it's also not that good. You can't find something 'wow' you in this place
222,5.0,"Took the Cable Cars up to the N Tower and it was amazing!  We went at dusk, and as the sun set, we saw Seoul transform into a glittering city of lights and sparkle!  Well worth a night trip.  We visited the Love Locks, had hot chocolate and took in all that the N-Tower had to offer"
223,4.0,Came here twice..  But the tower itself is boring to me..  I love the love lock.. I love the mountain..  But too bad they only have two train to go up.. Or we can take bus instead
224,5.0,"Wow! The N Seoul Tower is a must visit attraction. You have 360 unrestrictive views of the entire city. In addition, each window tells you the distance to most major cities in the world. This attraction took me about 2 hours to enjoy, including lunch. By the way, if you have the chance, get the Entrance + Lunch combo. The cost was only less than $100 and it included three full meals and entrance to the tower."
225,5.0,Easy to go all the way up...spectacular views of the city...option to go up and down by foot...some restaurants and souvenir shops available...great place to take some nice pics
226,4.0,"It is the most popular place in Seoul! Easy to get, nice view from the observatory (if u only wanna take some pics with love lockets, i suggest you dont need to buy the observatory tix)"
227,4.0,"this is a good place for couple, they can hang their lock as a symbol of their love, but if you're single you can come here and enjoy the scenery, a beautiful view of Seoul"
228,5.0,"Everyone goes to the tower and you are glad you did it. The view is amazing, but try to pick a sunny day or less fog so you can see really far. I liked the cable car ride up to the tower, but you can always take the stairs. At the base of the tower is where the Locks of Love are and that‚Äôs fun to see. You have to buy a ticket to go up to the top or you can eat in a restaurant. We just went up and enjoyed the view."
229,5.0,It so amazing when I go to Seoul tower.  When I saw that place in tv.  I wish I will go there with friend.  I just couldnt imagine I can see the real pad lock.
230,5.0,"The tower was the last attraction I was keen to see and almost didn't get to as I don't think I could've found it on my own. My sister and I were able to access the tower via the cable car service, something we TOTALLY recommend. Its just a part of the experience. Also, unless you LOVE to hike, we definitely suggest taking the cable car. I had spent about 18 days walking around South Korea so decided against walking there. We arrived at the tower at 10:30PM, last admission for the cable car back is 11:00PM (otherwise you walk back down if you miss it) so we spread our time between looking at the sights, taking quick snaps then headed to see the love locks! Honestly 10-15 minutes up there is all you need. The love locks were most interesting for us.The views from the tower were absolutely beautiful. It doesnt take you long at all to do a circle before you are back to where you began. Each panel has a different country listed so we were happy trying to find ours. The Love Locks didn't disappoint. If you are a massive fan of kdramas, this is the place to visit as seen in kdramas such as Boys over flowers and My love from the star etc. When we came back down the tower, there was a wall with thousands of signatures and messages left by people from around the world who had visited so we left ours too :D Food places available there too. Overall a fantastic experience and Im so glad I got to visit before I left."
231,5.0,Everything a kdrama fan expected and received. Wonderful view of the Han river and the city at night.
232,4.0,"if you take cable car, 5K Won for 1 way and 8.5K Won for return trip for adults. Serene and tranquil atmosphere up there and they have performance too."
233,4.0,"You can take the gondola lift to the top but if you're average fit I highly recommend to walk up there. The road is sure a bit steep but not that bad that you lose breath. The whole path is green, made of wooden stairs and you can rest at any point. There are a few view points where you can see breathtaking views and take pictures.Up there there's a park by the tower and cafes and restrooms and souvenir shops. I personally enjoyed the hot chocolate in the sun as the weather in November is a bit cool.Again we walked down from another path where thousands of people were for a Sunday hike/walk. Everyone peaceful. There are monuments, buildings and traditional villages on the way down."
234,4.0,"Coming up here in winter literally took our breath away due to strong winds and the cold. However, it‚Äôs still worth it to come up here to take some shots and enjoy the Seoul lights at night. Purchasing the lock isn‚Äôt necessary but still a good memory."
235,5.0,"To Fall in love in seoul South Korea is to go to seoul tower at night time. Tho, almost every tourist spot in seoul is to be paid in thousands of won it was one of the best spot in Korea..."
236,5.0,It's so pretty at night! Mesmerising view from the viewing deck. The love locks were a sight to behold as well.
237,4.0,This is one of the perfect way to fall in love more to Seoul. You can enjoy the city view in daylight and nighttime and in every season. You better bring your cameras and your walking shoes if you want to climb the slopes but the easiest way to go up is using the cable car. You can do a lot of things in N Seoul Tower and there are restaurants and cafes too.
238,5.0,"Considered a date place by locals however there is a lot of history and plenty of things for kids to do.  The cable car ride up is fun and the view is stunning.  There are locks with couple‚Äôs names every where and a proposal bridge.  You can buy locks there if you find you suddenly needing to purchase one. There is a huge lg tv 3D area that is free, you can get a picture made with a loop Star in s holographic booth or have a traditional Korean meal.  We watched the guards send smoke signals over the city which was really interesting."
239,4.0,We went there by Bus No.3 from Seoul Station Exit 9. They have a beautiful view. We can see the city of Seoul from above and buy a lot of cute souvenir.
240,4.0,We went at dusk. It was cold but surreal. The night scenes were great. Weather was really windy and cold but was warm and toasty in the observatory tower.
241,5.0,Seoul Tower gives a great opportunity to look over the whole of the city for just a small entrance fee. I went at night time which was amazing as Seoul was all lit up. The cable car was also very good although there is a waiting time to get on. There is also lots of love locks if you want to participate in the thousands of locks attached to fences.
242,5.0,"Had a great time looking out over the city. A must if it's your first time to Seoul. Just make sure your taxi understands you want to get dropped off at the cable car on the south side of the mountain, otherwise you have a pretty steep walk ahead of you."
243,2.0,"Be ready to climb up the steep steep road. It's not recommended for senior people.  Not good to also bring infants because if they're on stroller, difficult to move up. Limited access to go up the tower, it's quick but line is long. There is no view actually because you could see the same sky-scape when you're in your hotel or in the airplane."
244,5.0,"The view from N Seoul tower was amazing. Everywhere we looked, it was filled with colour. We took the cable car to the top and walked down."
245,3.0,"Good place to see the entire city from above. However, KRW 15K/pax  is expensive. It's only a high tower, not any more."
246,5.0,"Perfect place to visit. You can see the entire Seoul City from the top of the Tower. You can lock your love story also in the special place just beside the tower entrance. Very fantastic place to visit, the view is extraordinary, the caf√© area offers great view towards the city as well. A very recommended place to visit. Note: I recommend you to bring some cash when you visiting the site because the ATM on the site charging very high tax."
247,5.0,"We walked up to the tower late on a Friday night. We weren't sure if the cable cars were running so we walked about 20 minutes along the road to the tower. It wasn't bad of a walk at all - we enjoyed the quiet of the surrounding woods. The tower complex has many stores, restaurants, and attractions. The view from the top was stunning. I highly recommend going at night but I'd love to come back during the day as well."
248,4.0,A hike to N Seoul Tower is a must!  Beautiful 360 degrees view of the city and then take the cable car going down
249,5.0,"The N Seoul tower is accessible by cable car.It required a long walking distance with slope to Namsan Cable Car boarding place after coming out from Gate 2, Myeongdong subway station, may take taxi to reach the boarding place.The fee will be charged to visit Observatory at the N Seoul Tower. But the great view on the top of Namsan tower has definitely become a good spot for photolovers. As well, the visitor is able to enjoy the performance- Namsan Beacon Mound Martial Arts¬†at 3pm."
250,5.0,"At first I thought this would just be another tourist trap, but it turned out to be well worth visiting. I went during the autumn season though, so this could be the reason why it was so beautiful. All the trees had orange, yellow and red leaves making the little uphill walk to the tower such a beautiful experience. It felt serene to be surrounded by nature while in the city. Seeing the whole Seoul at the top of the tower viewing deck was also great."
251,5.0,"We visited the tower on a nice clear day and used the cable car to get up at about midday. It was rather busy and the tower itself is a little pricey from my view, so instead we just stayed around the base and the views even there are spectacular and make for some great pictures.You must 100% visit, mainly on a clear day."
252,5.0,One of the must visit place when you're in Seoul.. Can get a nice view of the city and you can leave your signature lock here üîì
253,4.0,"our hotel was very close to the cable car station yet we tried walking. its a long uphill walk and very tiring but its worth it because you get to see and enjoy the beautiful scenery along the way. and upon reaching the tower, you get to see the magnificent view of the city."
254,5.0,"I would recommend visiting this place at night, not to late so shops are open when you go but late enough that you can see the lights. I would say I mostly saw couples at this place but even if your just with your friends, family or traveling by yourself it's still a must do. Bring your own lock or buy one there and set your mark.You can either take the cable car or the bus, transportation is pretty convenient and on a set schedule."
255,4.0,"The elevator ride is already worth it. It is just so cool to be in the heart of Seoul and to see the whole if the city surrounded by mountains. Make sure you have little sit at the toilet too, I know it sounds weird but just believe me on this one haha"
256,4.0,The place is a perfect one to unwind and correlate with nature. This place with a view of the city lights in the evening and the wonderful trees and nature sight during daytime particularly during autumn which adds wonderful experience on your visit in this place. The love padlocks scattered around the place are good way of taking a look about lovers wishes and messages to each other. The N Tower is included to the tourist attractions when you get the Discover Seoul Pass.
257,3.0,"We didn‚Äôt bother going up the tower beyond the free locations, as we find the base of the tower already offered great views of the city at almost 360 degrees angle.In particular we found the gift shop was pricey and lack variety of souvenirs.  We took the bus up to the tower and found it very convenient and cheap to commute to.  Would recommend visiting!"
258,4.0,We were here in the morning so its quiet great but I think its best at night to see the lights of Seoul City at night.
259,5.0,Come during the afternoon until dark.Enjoy the view and city lights at night.Also you can enjoy walking up and down. But would suggest to take the cable car.
260,4.0,Have a nice view...I came here at spring and the weather about 15 degree in the evening and may be cooler at night... we must prepare light coat.. love this place... romantic and istgramable...
261,3.0,"A breathtaking view awaits you! Every one will really enjoy a 360degree view of the Seoul City. There is a coffee shop and a souvenir shop awaiting for you at the top. Having a cup of coffee and overlooking the 360 degree of Seoul Is somehow very hard to describe.Once done, you can buys souvenirs for friends and family at home. You can even have your  picture taken right at the ground level, and once u are up there thru the loft, your picture will be printed. Thats how fast it is. Suitable for family and even couples whom are feeling very romantic."
262,5.0,Seoul tower is a must see attraction in Seoul. It is true that you have to climb a hill to get there but on the top your efford is paid off with amazing view of the city. It is also appropriate for people in love because there is a fence where they can lock their love with a lock foreverüòÄ
263,5.0,"The iconic landmark of Seoul. Go there in the evening so that u can get both day & night view.   Do allocate extra 1hour for the cable car queue. I suggest that you take the elevator to the cable car station. Walking there is tiring especially if you travel with seniors and kids as it‚Äôs uphill road. To get to the elevator , exit at Hoyeon station NOT myeondong."
264,4.0,"The symbol of Seoul is open from 10 am. Couples leave each other's names on the keys after they are written down. The observatory fee is 10,000 won. Hello Kitty has an exhibition hall."
265,4.0,"Visited N Seoul Tower during my visit to Korea. The walk to the Tower is very steep and a bit tiring but I'm sure young people will enjoy. In the tower, it was good view of the city. The souvenir  shop was good too."
266,5.0,Travelling to korea will not be complete without visiting this amazing tourist attraction.You need to exert extra effort to reach the top of the Tower. We went here last April 2017 and its freaking cold.This is also the place where you can see the  love locks in the area. Such a romantic place to be with your partner and or ur family.
267,5.0,"If you're in Seoul for more than a day, definitely consider visiting the tower. You can get there by subway (close enough) from the Myeongdong stops, and walk towards the mountain. Eventually you will see signs for the Namsan park and tower. At the base is a gondola, but walking up the staired path is free, and takes about 20 mins at a leisurely pace. There are good views and photo spots along the way. At the top there are some assorted restaurants and eateries, and the tower itself. Also, at the plaza there is usually some kind of cultural-related event taking place, and there is the world famous ""love lock"" wall you've seen in many Korean dramas. The walk down is rather steep, so be careful if it is wet."
268,4.0,"Went to Seoul tower as a must do/see kind of thing. We started the trail at the beginning of the steps and didn't know there was a cable car initially. Anyhow, great exercise going up the mile of steps. Great easy workout with plenty of places to pause for a quick rest and plenty of photo ops along the way. Plenty of people to include small children were working their way to the top. Once up there, you find the love lock area. Similar to Paris' love lock bridges only difference is there's not bridge and it's encouraged. The day we went there was a show going on so free entertainment on top of being random tourists. You can go inside the tower for food, toilets, gift shops, and for the observation deck. We didn't bother with paying to go on the deck as you can see some cool sights just walking around. We decided to do the cable car on the way down for another unique experience. Got to see the city from a different point of view and tickets are fairly cheap. If you can't do the hike up of the stairs, the cable car goes up and down. Just need a little patience to wait in the line. Would def go back again for the hike up."

We left our hotel about a mile from the tower at 2pm walking and returned at about 6pm.  The time is spent waiting in lines to get up the cable car and the tower. About an hour wait for the cable car and 30 min for the tower.  The observation Deck is worth the extra money.  I really did not understand how big this city really is until I was on the observation Deck.  As far as the eye can see in every direction, the city sprawls out over the landscape.  It is so beautiful and amazing.  Truly is a humbling and awe inspiring sight.  Was worth the wait and worth the experience.  My guess is that it is less busy in the morning."
270,4.0,"A was a nice and sunny day, albeit a wee bit hazy. Went all the way to the top and nice views of Seoul (11 million people are living here). Plenty of things to do and can spent half a day easily. You can walk all the way up, or even cycle, but would be okay to go to top by car and walk down. Plenty of lights to make evening visit worthwhile."
271,5.0,"If you enjoy a long walk or run, check this place out!  The views are spectacular!  The walkways get work up a good sweat!"
272,4.0,The tower is advertised as a romantic place for couples. When we reached there it was so crowded and the line to buy the tickets were equally long and took us another 45 mins to line up to get to the top of the tower. But that could have been our fault as we did not check if we could have bought the tickets online prior to us going up.Once you are up there you can see the whole of Seoul (provided it's not a cloudy day). At the bottom of the tower you can write little messages and lock it by a designated fence there <3My advise is to buy your own little lock before heading to Namsam tower because buying it there is quite expensive. Overall it was a nice and wonderful experience a part from the crowd.
273,4.0,"First on my list before coming to Seoul was the tower. And I didnt regret it at all. Seoul is huge so you better come 236m above ground to check the city from air. Also I was lucky with the weather, so I got a full beautiful picture of this huge city. If the weather is nice I would suggest going up by foot and coming down by cable car."
274,5.0,"Nice place for tour in SEOUL. Tower has different color depend on air conditions. Green, blue, yellow, red....etc"
275,5.0,It was fun riding the Namsan Tour bus to see one of Seoul's tourist attraction. It was an amazing experience. Don't miss to see the mesmerising view of Nseoul tower when you're in Seoul. #NseoulTower #Ktravel
276,3.0,"Not too bad of a view up there but we realize without paying for the observatory deck, the deck below where all the locks are, do have a nice view. The wait to head up was crazy. We were told to come back 2 hours later. But thank god we bought a package with the sensory experience and could head up the observatory right after. Heading up to this place was quite a chore. We had to wait an hour or so for the bus to travel up and down. Heard that the waiting time for cable car was worse. The frequency of the buses were slow. Would suggest them to have a shuttle bus specially dedicated for visitors even if it means charging, rather than having to take a public bus and to impose on their locals who merely want to take a bus from one point to another. Actually another good place to see the view of Seoul would be Seoul Sky Tower that is newly opened and more accessible."
277,5.0,Was a lot of lines and crowded. But very nice views!  Is obviously a great place for couples and people getting engaged. The hello kitty island and the ssentoy were a little over rated. I wouldn't pay to go back in them.
278,1.0,"Do you want to waste your time waiting for a single lift up, then a single lift back down?Do you like to queue/wait for hours on end?Then N Seoul Tower is for you!I've included a photo of the line for the lift to the bottom floor, what you don't see if that it wraps around the whole building twice.Don't bother coming up to the observatory, you'll just get back to the bottom annoyed and frustrated."
279,5.0,The tower is worth visiting both during daytime and at night. The red leaves in Oct/Nov make it a good photo spot while the night scenes  are also great. You.can find the lock chains for lovers  along the railings of the foot paths. We  enjoyed every minute of our visit there and had wonderful buffet dinner with great evening views. It was difficult to get a taxi back to the city centre from the cable car station but you can always walk down to Myeongdong. It took about 20 minute. Quite a nice walk too after a heavy meal.
280,4.0,"Ended up going for a morning jog up this hill to see the top. While I only recommend this if you are fit (the incline isn't forgiving), it was well worth the effort. The view from the top of this hill allows you to see most of Seoul. There are a few places to eat and if you're lucky, you'll even get to enjoy some live entertainment near the temple at the top. The tower is not too expensive and affords you a birds eye view of a massive city.There are a few other things to see at the top of this hill, to include the lock bridge, where young couples proclaim their love for one another with padlocks hanging from the railings. And of course, there is the gondola lift that will take you to the top and back for a very reasonable rate. I'd recommend doing this at night, as it not only shows you the entire city, but adds a bit of ""ahh"" to the ride, since you are unable to see the tree line swooping past you.Overall, this was a nice little tourist spot in Seoul and worth visiting. There are many methods to get to the top and if you have the time, it is worth exploring all the areas around the top, as you'll see some great sights."
281,2.0,no special design. You should go at night just to see the view of the entire Seoul. That's it. Nothing's special.
282,5.0,"This was our 3rd trip to Seoul and we finally made it to the tower.  We rode the cable car to the top at night.  Nothing special there.  The views of Seoul from the tower were very cool and the city lights very beautiful.  We hiked down and that was very fun.  If you hike down, make sure you have decent shoes and can walk well.  Not a place for high heels.Some thought this was the coolest thing we did in Seoul."
283,5.0,"N Seoul Tower, aka Namsan, is one of the most popular attractions for visitors in Seoul. I've been there several times in the years I've lived in Korea. The best way I've found to get there, is to take the subway to Itaewon then grab a taxi to go up the hill. If you tell the taxi driver, Namsan Tower, they know where that is and may ask you top or bottom. Why? Because from the bottom, you can take a cable car ride to the almost-top and walk the rest of the way. The view from the cable car is pretty nice to see whether you go during the day or night, you get a birds-eye view of Seoul as far as your eyes can see.When you arrive at the almost-top, it's still a bit of a climb going up to the tower. My last visit, I went with my niece and nephew (10, 7 years old). They were fine walking up the stairs to the tower. At the Namsan Tower, you buy tickets for the Tower. There are different prices for additional attractions. When you get inside, you go through a souvenir photo background booth where photographers will take photos of you with a neutral screen background. If you're interested in the photos, you can purchase them upstairs. The digital photos can be mixed with different backgrounds of the Tower: in Spring with cherry blossoms, at night with the lights, during the day, etc. The observation deck at the top of Namsan Tower also has a photo booth where visitors can dress up in traditional Korean clothes- hanbok. It's a little pricey, but fun if you're into that kind of memorable souvenir.Going down: you can either take the cable car back down to where you started or walk down. My niece, nephew and I decided to walk down. That day, it started raining, drizzling, as we were walking. When we got to the bottom, we grabbed a taxi going to Insadong- our next stop."
284,4.0,"Went for the third time.  Couple Love locks are still there. We walked to reach the top, rather than taking the cable car.  Nice area for an evening."
285,4.0,"I went to this site by cable car (admission fee 8000‚Ç©/person round trip). It open until 8am (we left on 7.30am and cable car still operated).You can just walk around the tower, see the view and there's unique spot: love chain everywhere. Besides, you can enter the tower and go up, but it needs extra fee 10000‚Ç©/person. In the tower, you can see Seoul from the sky and you can see sunset. Best spot to take the night scene (light of the city) is in outside the tower (no window).It's modern tourism you can get from Seoul."
286,5.0,Pad lock lover. Couple will write their wish in the pad lock n  lock all the way of the staicase. I had yummy pop corn in the top of namsan tower. Surprisingly the coffee price is still normal price not like other tourist attraction. I love namsan tower.
287,3.0,"The tower is surrounded by lavish natureSince it's a little old, don't expect hightech featuresThe position on a hill gives it a little edge to have a 360 degrees look on SeoulThere is a nice souvenirs shop on top and a candy shop underneath it"
288,4.0,"both of us take train then take the public bus there to seoul tower at night.realy nice view ...can see the city there...v take a lot of picture there....as v went at night,the light all seems awesome...i just feel like so romantic...so lovely nnnn sweet at this place..thus you must bring your couples there to enjoy this beautiful scene n capture the beautiful scene in korea...visit korea must visit seoul tower..yeah...üòâ"
289,5.0,"I choose to get Namsan Tower by Cable Car, due to my Hotel near Myeongdong then I need to walk from Hotel Pacific area, you need trekking to find Cable Car station, it takes 15 mins then enjoy the view from Cable car, once you arrive, prepare your feet to go upstairs and Finally you find a super beautiful Namsan Tower, enjoy the coolest photo spot, museum teddy bear, don't forget to go the observatory and also shopping cute things a lot. my suggest is buy cable car ticket for return for saving. Happy explore Namsan :)"
290,4.0,Must visit this tower because it is the iconic landmark if you come to Seoul. You can view the Seoul city from the above and it is very spectacular!
291,4.0,Very nice view and great relaxing feeling while strolling along hill. You can see distance between districts clearly and elevator ride was quick too.
292,3.0,It was raining when we went there and it was foggy. Could barely see the city from above. Nice cooling.area during the summer.
293,5.0,"Almost every place has its own iconic tower. So this is a must-go if it's your first time to Seoul, just for that ""been there done that"" picture. It's accessible from Myeongdong anyway, so why not?"
294,3.0,"This is one of the main landmarks in Seoul, the waiting lines were dredful, line to the cable car, to the elevator ..etc The view to the tower is amazing cuz it's in Namsan park, but to tell the truth it wasn't really that much you can do up there haha"
