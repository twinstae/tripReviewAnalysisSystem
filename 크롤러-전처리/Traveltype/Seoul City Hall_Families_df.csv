0,3.0,We went here because it is very close with our hotel at myeongdong area. We went here after visit Deoksugung palace. Just for photostop.
1,4.0,"The original Seoul City hall became the Seoul Metropolitan Library and behind it stands the new city hall which is a very exciting and impressive modern building made of glass and steel and where the Seoul Metropolitan Government is based. The new building was completed and opened in 2012 and is a stone's throw from several well known landmarks such as the Lotte Duty Free building, the Grevin Museum and the Plaza Hotel."
2,4.0,"Seoul has two City Halls, one old and the other new. The Old City hall which was supposed to be built in 1900s has been now converted into a Library. The new one was open in in 2012 and houses most of the government offices along with other Multipurpose halls and cultural centers including Cafes. The new City hall is a multi storied building with glass fa√ßade impressing one and all. Visit to this place can be clubbed along with Deoksgung Palace.This place is in a walkable distance from the City Hall Subway Station."
3,5.0,"This wasn't on our planned itinerary, and it turned out to be a surprisingly pleasant experience! It was around 6 PM on a weekday, and we had gone in and taken pictures of the vertical gardens, and this glowing light structure. On our way out, one of the senior guards motioned us to the elevator, and told a passing local to escort us to the basement. Upon exiting the elevator, we went out to this floor where photo ops abound! Take a picture with different wall colors, pretend to be ""On Air"" at a studio, look for the ""Lego Wall,"" admire the pastel image-covered lights, and go through a relics exhibit hall! We were only able to explore one floor, but there seems to be two floors of this ""Citizens' Hall."" Wish they promoted this more!"
4,5.0,"We stopped by here to take some pictures in front of the town hall and the ""I Seoul U"" sign. The building is impressive so yes, definitely do the picture rounds here."
5,5.0,There is a plaza in front of the building where you should get your photo moment when in Seoul. There were people setting up booths and stage for some event.
6,5.0,One of the best architectural building in Seoul. We went to see the building up close & personal on a Sunday morning. Very nice building with walls of foliage & looks like a glass building from far. A picture perfect place for tourist and architecture lovers!
7,5.0,"Honestly I had planned on going here just to get a photo with the Running Man cast in the second basement.  I didn't realize the place itself was just amazing!  It's really more than just a city hall.  It was modern, educational, fun, and just full of stuff to see and do, for adults and kids!  It was connected to the subway so it was very easy to get to.  There is an area where they had protected some archaeological finds that was seamlessly built into the building.  It was just fantastic!  I wish all city halls were like it!"
8,4.0,"It's a big city hall, the interior looks unique and modern. And it's a good spot for photo at the front of the building."
9,5.0,Great building. The combination of old and modern is perfectly balanced and goes well together. Very creative architecture.
10,4.0,"City Hall new building is in a modern design, actually futurist design, and inside the old building which part of it remain in front of the new building there is a public library. Outside of the old building the clock also remains there."
11,5.0,"This is where everythings happens right next to Plaza Hall, Westin Chosun Hotel & Lotte Hotel.  People voice their opinions whenever they want about why they are upset. It became a habit, tradition, passion to voice loud what people wanted to be heard. It can be annoying for traffic or some noise. Koreans are use to it. But I don't know about the visitors. It's a beautiful place of Seoul, the heart of Seoul, but also a place to avoid at times. This is the state of Korea, Seoul in this century reflecting its good & bad, the history, the anger & angst as well."
12,3.0,Right in the city opposite major shopping centre. Interesting building and worthy a photo.  A nice big oval in front of the City hall with market as well in certain time.
13,3.0,There are many events that occur in the front of City Hall.  We just went last week for a Street Artist Festival.  The event was fun and the building is structurally very pretty and unusual.
14,4.0,"On our last day of our Korea trip, we had a couple of hours in the morning before the pickup service to the airport, we decided to maximize our time by exploring the city hall of Seoul.As our hotel is located within reasonable walking distance to the city hall, we decided to explore the place by foot. So after our breakfast at our hotel, we embarked on a walking trail.As we walked along the streets, we were amazed by the different buildings here in unique designs and architectural themes we encountered and the greenery lanes that the city hall has to offer, a good segregation between commercialization and nature that impressed us. It's so relaxing and soothing to be able to be near to ""mother nature"" in a busy, crowded bustling city! It's a good place to experience Seoul and immerse in it.If not of the limited time we had, we would love to walk and see more here. On our way, we also came across bikes rental booths and perhaps another good way to explore the place is via cycling!"
15,4.0,"We visited the City Hall area to relax, walk on the grass and view the busy Seoul streets. This is a popular place for meeting persons. There was an art exhibit titled ""the peace of the world"" which used bombs, bullets as the basis for displaying figures that were based on hope and recovery from war.The City Hall building is unmistakable, and shows the modernity of Seoul. this is in stark contrast to the Deoksugung palace which is on the opposite side of the grassed area. The City Hall is actually built on what used to be the palace grounds. I found this an enjoyable place to stroll early in the morning and listen to the sounds of Seoul waking up. In he summer, the sprinklers are sometimes  turned on, and children enjoy cooling off here."
16,4.0,"This is apparently not beloved by all of Seoul -- however I say good job for building something that is unusual and iconic.  Remember, the people of Paris hated the Eiffel Tower when it was built."
17,4.0,"If you have any free time, should visit this place.  The location is close to the big palace. Very interesting."
18,5.0,"By a series of fortunate errors, I ended up spending over an hour at Seoul City Hall. The building itself is fascinating with sweeping glass, interesting art installations and all sorts of other things happening. This was not on my Seoul ""to do"" list but I am so glad I went."
19,4.0,"Seoul is a city well used by it's citizens and the outdoor space at Citi Hall always has something on offer. On a recent visit we were lucky enough to come across a great drumming and Tae Kwon Do show on the Saturday night and by mid-week there was a farmers market, complete with refrigerated butchers vans."
20,5.0,"Close to Myeongdong. Events at night on some night, close to stream.  Nice structured, most tour end/ drop off point."
21,4.0,A truly wonderful peice of architecture Its location to downtown is perfect. Its green idea is so cool
22,4.0,Great location and nice to spend 45 minutes. We loved the combination and integration of the old city hall with the new modern glass structure right behind it.
23,5.0,"If you like modern architecture this building is a must. Not something that we had planned though we were elated for the experience. Beautiful architecture, central sculpture and and vines climbing/descending 7 floors."
24,3.0,It honestly doesn't look like a City Hall due to its fine architecture design. Hope i was able to go inside.
