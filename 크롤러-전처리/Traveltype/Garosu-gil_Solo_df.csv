0,5.0,"After the streets of Myeongdong, Hongdae, Ewha and Gangnam I was very eager to leave those places as it swarms with a lot of people either shopping or partying. Imagine my excitement at experiencing this area with such chill vibes with same cosmetics stores, high end stores and artistic buildings. If you are looking for a chill place to get coffee or buy sports clothing or casual wears with less people and less noise. This is the place."
1,2.0,"This area used to be a trendy area with a lot of nice cafes, restaurants, and boutique shops. However, in the recent years has seen a huge number of big brands coming in and made the whole area a.... meh... not interesting any more."
2,5.0,"You need to dedicate your entire afternoon at garosugil. Over here they have unique clothing boutique that shouts 'korean-style'. And of course its selling at a higher price as the design you can't find it at places like hongdae, edae or myeongdong. Judging from the quality it definitely worth the price. My advice is don't focus only on shops located along the main street. There are many more hidden gems inside those narrow alley. If you are tired there are plenty of cafes for you to choose. Have a sip of coffee and enjoy people-watching, or you can chit-chat with friends. Also, there are a lot of instaworthy corners for you to explore. Don't be shy because they are many people posing for photos too. I hope you guys will enjoy garosugil as much as I do."
3,3.0,The street is beautiful and lined with trees filled with autumn colours. There are many trendy shops and cafes scatter around the area. The people here seems more affluent looking and well-dressed compared to other areas.
4,4.0,Much cleaner than other areas in Seoul but this is matched by the calibre of shop and the general attitude of the people wandering around even more image conscious than the regular people around Seoul.Quite a few nice restaurants and far less busy which can be nice.
5,5.0,"I went here twice because I liked it so much. They have amazing cafes and nice clothes shops (Mango, Hollister etc). I went on a sunday afternoon and I think it was a good time, because everyone sat outside at a cafe. Don't go in the morning as shops and cafes might still be closed. I would come back here."
6,4.0,"I went there on a Monday morning via subway. The ride was pleasant and not packed as I expected it to be as it was 9am at the time. People are definitely dressed a lot more trendy and fashionable here. Had a latte (excellent!) at Coffeesmith (left side of garosu-gil as you turn in and walk a few metres) before I strolled the street as most shops only open at 10:30 or 11am. I must say wi-fi was excellent in that area as I could connect to free wifi as I walked along the street. Tip : Signal is exceptionally strong in front of Sulbing (dessert shop not far from Coffeesmith) and across the street from it. The street has individual shops selling fashionable/trendy clothing & shoes of western and local labels, cosmetics, unique jewellery pieces and plenty of cafes and restaurants."
7,4.0,Girly shopping street in Shinsa dong with lots of shops selling mostly ladies' goods such as clothing and accessories.
8,3.0,"Its a good place to walk after a heavy lunch. The streets are lined with designed trees, there are a few cafes offering coffee and pastry."
9,4.0,"Garosu-Gil, is located in Sinsa district, Gangnam, means tree street. Adorned with gingo trees, Garosu-Gil stretches less than a kilometer. There are tons of stores on the both side of garosu street. Line 3, exit 8 of Sinsa Station"
10,4.0,"I had a great day with amazing food in the restaurant, yummy latte/ dessert during cafe hopping, enjoyable shopping in the boutique shops and nice walk along the shopping street. It would be a good place to go if you enjoy boutique shops experience."
11,5.0,"Shopping local designer clothes. Good food are around the area. Seems like one of the hippiest place in seoul! Especially for fashionista, this is a great place for you!"
12,5.0,"Amazing place full of shops and hidden gems, It's my favourite place in Seoul, you could just walk and wonder, eat and shop. you could basically do a lot of stuff there."
13,3.0,"Tons of cafes for you to sit and people watch or to relax. There are lots more international brands in the area now as compared to two years ago, some of the shops I remembered were no longer there. There is a stand alone 3CE store worth visiting but it was quiet when I went. Shops pricing is in the mid to high level tier."
14,5.0,"Although Garosu-gil shops are mostly tagged with brands, it's super relaxing to take a stroll along this street. It doesn't feel like I'm in Korea. Everything is so trendy at Garosu-gil and people spotted here dress really well! It's like Apgujeong and Cheongdamdong, but not as high end. Lots of nice cafes are located here too. One of the nicest places to chill in Seoul!"
15,4.0,"Lovely area , many clothes shop , make up and desserts , include restaurant and lovely coffee shop . A bit higher price but unique and not too crowded like myeongdong . Good for walking along the street , relaxing :)))"
16,4.0,"A lovely area to stroll around and relax on a weekend. Other than those common brands, there are some independent stores in this area.  My favourite Cafe Osulloc also has a store here."
17,4.0,It would be great to visit during Autumn. You will see the yellowish of Ginkgo trees along the alley. A lot of designers' shops along the street. Don't forget to drop by LINE Friends & Cafe.
18,4.0,A fashion street staple for Seoulites looking for what's hip and not ordinary. Said to be a sight during autumn with the gingko trees lining the street turning golden. A favorite venue for fashion shoots. Lovely place to explore during a lazy afternoon.
19,3.0,"This place has its own beauty, but I do not recommend people to buy something. They are too expensive than other places. Just look around, and spend some time. Food are fine."
20,2.0,"I went to Garosugil just out of curiosity but I did not enjoy being there at all. There are a lot of cafes and restaurant around and maybe some attraction like the Line Cafe but it just doesn't attract me. For someone who likes shopping, they might enjoy garosugil a lot but I don't really like shopping so it's not that fun for me"
21,4.0,"it's melting pot of those young rich, famous, artsy. For just hangout, you can find the Kirin Ichiban beer garden. Or music lover, there's small isle not far from forever 21 where you can see underground music scene of young and talented jazz and soul musicians performs"
22,4.0,"I stayed in Ibis Gangnam hotel and it took around 20 minutes by taxi. I could see the distance between them were not far but because of the traffic jam, it took more. I recommend to take subway instead of taxi. However it was full of young guys shopping around. Very crowded shopping spot with many restaurants. I wish they have more Korean brands than international one like Zara, H&M, Hollister etc.... Beside that it was good place to shop and eat."
23,5.0,"European inspired street Garosu-gil has many upscale boutiques to shop at and street vendors. Kind of reminds me of Newbury Street in Boston. There are also many restaurants to dine at on the street and coffee shops. It's a beautiful street with lots of ginko trees on it, and there are many side streets that have shops on them too. Definitely save one or two days to eat dinner at the restaurants on Garosu-gil!"
24,5.0,"This street was not the easiest to find (exit 8 Sinsa station), but was totally worth the search, it has really nice shops (upscale international and asian but still affordable) and restaurants, some bars. We went in the evening but I would imagine that it would be as nice lunchtime. We also saw a live band in a bar called 'crazy horse' , they were great! Overall compared to other areas in Seoul this was my favorite!"
