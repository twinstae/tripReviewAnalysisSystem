There was good place to had relax time and to walk leisurely in Metro city. The smell and view of tulip was very good to me. Though this park was located near my office, but I didn't visit till one year past. I'll visited sometimes after lunch. Very good park in Seoul."
1,5.0,"Early spring visit, where trees and flowers just started to blossom. This is one of the best parks I've ever visited.Fresh air and cool breeze! I call it Forest in the middle of the city. üòçüòç"
2,3.0,"It‚Äôs still pretty cold in Seoul and the park was full of dead trees and grass. The winter chill has prevented anything from growing and no one but a few elderly were walking in the park. I trust the reviews of my fellow TripAdvisor users that this park is great during the warmer parts of the year. The park has paid parking, and easy access from the subway station. Buses do also frequently stop at Seoul Forest. The restroom is cleaned regularly and well maintained."
3,5.0,"In autumn, Seoul Forest becomes magical as the various trees change into yellow, orange and red. The weather is cool so it is more pleasant to walk around.The forest is easy to reach by the Seoul subway. At the Seoul Forest station, use the lift near Exit 3 to reach the ground level. Turn right and then left into Under Stand Avenue. I spent some hours in the forest, exploring the various parts. From the entrance, I kept to the right of the forest as the trees on that side were particularly colorful.The weather was cold, so the bird corner at the far right was empty. Then I turned back to the rear of the forest where the Ginkgo Road, under the afternoon sun, was absolutely absorbing. From there I passed under two bridges on my right to reach the Deer Corner (with spotted deer). Later I returned to the entrance, passing by the lake. I spent over 4 hours there, totally absorbed by its beauty in autumn. The forest is huge hence it is important to plan your walking route beforehand."
4,4.0,"I really wanted to see a deer as I've never encountered one before. I went to the park and the weather was perfect. There were also children on a trip the day I visited. We fed the deer via a vending machine that sold food for the deer and I honestly enjoyed this experience.For a tourist though I can understand that this isn't something everyone would enjoy. My mother didn't even bother coming with me as she found it 'boring' but I really enjoy long walks and just sitting down, people watching."
5,5.0,"I went in early October. The trees beginning to change colour from green to orange. Very relaxing, beautiful and calming."
6,5.0,"This park was lovely, with beautiful greenery, landscaping as well as architecture. Managed to take some nice shots. Wasn‚Äôt too crowded on a Tuesday morning. Worth a visit."
7,5.0,"Went Seoul for an incentive trip and got a half day free on the last day.So I decided to go Seoul Forest to see butterflies.  I went there by taxi and walked around in the large park, finally got into the butterfly garden.I‚Äôve already able to see a lot of butterflies outside the butterfly garden.It‚Äôs a good experience to learn ecological in other countries"
8,2.0,"There's just nothing much to do here and a whole lot of bugs. There is, however, a public piano, if you can play"
9,4.0,"It was raining during my visit so there were no many visitors. The place is not difficult to find but it is advisable to research for it on internet before you go. From the Seoul Forest metro station, there is a lift that takes you to the ground level. From the lift exit turn right and then left into the "" Under Stand Avenue"", a short street with shops built from metal containers. If you are hungry there is a noodle shop with reasonable prices. Once in the forest, you can find the cherry blossom road on the left. The cherry blossom trees are large and they flower in early April."
10,5.0,"I took a walk through Seoul Forest in February. Despite most of the plants being brown and dormant for the winter, I enjoyed the quiet and the design of the park. I can only imagine how much more wonderful it would be in the warmer months. With all of the activity in a busy city like Seoul, this park offers a moment to walk, talk, think, and rest before heading of to the next activity. In winter, go at least to take a walk. In the warmer months, plan to stay awhile longer and sit or play."
11,4.0,"I took the train here - very easy and cheap. Train station is only a 5 min walk to park. This park is very large, I probably spent 2 hours walking around it taking pictures. There are pretty birds; trees; art sculptures everywhere; deer corral; insect exhibit and tropical garden centre and more. Give yourself time, perhaps pack a lunch (though lots of good cafes around) and enjoy the space. I was happy I went (tskuem station on line 2 is what you want for the park)"
12,4.0,"Great place for a change of scenery! The forest isn't that big, but it is full of at least an hours worth of things to look at! I was there in June and the weather in Seoul was hot and very humid but, the trees in the forest provided a lot of shade."
13,4.0,I always visited there when i‚Äôm in Seoul. There is such a calm place in a big city. It is a good place to take a rest. I can enjoyed my autumn with colorful leaves. I will go back again and again.
14,5.0,There is a food truck area upon the station exit.  You get to visit here during autumn season for the ginko leaves.
15,5.0,"One of the nicer places to visit in Spring or Autumn for its cherry blossom or fall folliage in Seoul. Visited there in Autumn and wasn‚Äôt disappointed at all. It‚Äôs like forest bathing, you get to soak in nature and spend some relaxing time in the forest. Great for families, couples and even solo travelers to visit!"
16,5.0,Some amazing colours here. Pinks and reds. Had a wondeful walk around. Can feed the deers or just sit and think.  Fresh air and clean nature. Highly recommend this. It's wonderful.  Seoul forest metro station.  See if you can find the black cat that lives here. Decent snack bar too.  Had the fried potatoes
17,5.0,Big forest. Good weather makes this the perfect place to relax. The location isn't best but is a healthy environment for families and also couples
18,2.0,"Disappointed by the 'forest' that was really an urban park. The eco wetlands were disappointing- just a little patch of water with a wooden boardwalk through it. It's a large area with different themes- there's a sports area, picnic areas, eco areas.... Wasn't what I was expecting!"
19,5.0,"Located in the outskirt of town, this forest is a great place to wind down and stroll amongst nature. It provides great landscape for photographs too. The park features a butterfly garden, deer enclosure (you can feed them too if you purchase the feed at the vending machine for 1000 Won). There are birds flying around. There are water features which works on a season with rainfall. The forest also connects to Hangang Park and river view. Follow the map to enjoy a great stroll.Bundang (yellow) train line. Seoul Forest.Entrance of forest is at the back of the carpark."
20,5.0,"It is a chance to see the natural side of Seoul but there can be mosquitoes so take your cream/spray with you. You can feed deers and have a picnic. Also there is really beautiful disabled-friendly children's park, insect museum etc."
21,5.0,"Seoul park is the perfect getaway from the busy city of Seoul. The park has everything one needs for a perfect getaway. Great for picnic, meditation, naps, biking, strolling, and even deer watching."
22,5.0,"Away from most traffic noise, Seoul Forest is a fantastic way to spend a couple of hours to stroll around and be with nature. I was there in April and the paths were lined with rows and rows of cherry blossom trees. The crowd was manageable when I visited on a Saturday. A lot of people were riding bikes and feeding the deer. There is a small corner for bunnies and a butterfly enclosure too. I think it will be great to visit during the autumn as well."
23,5.0,"I went when it was still a bit too early for the cherry blossom season. But this is a really spacious park! You can rent a bike from bikeseoul.com, with 1,000won for an hour of cycling (I think), and I recommend you sort it out before reaching Seoul Forest Station. Directly in front of the exit is a row of green and white bikes which you can rent. You do not need to be a citizen of Korea to use the system, and all of them have baskets and gears. I thoroughly enjoyed stretching my legs, feeding the deer, and watching the bunnies. I did not have time to explore the entirety of the park, so I recommend at least 3 hours if you are the adventurous sort."
24,4.0,"It's a great park! Many surprises within! Away from the hustle & bustle of the city. Initially, I thought 1.5-2 hours should well be enough, but I spent around 3h inside! The park is full of autumn colors! The disappointing part is the Hangang River, as it's filled with the traffic noise. It's free admission, and you can get a free map from the Information counter near the entrance. It's a good free attraction!"
