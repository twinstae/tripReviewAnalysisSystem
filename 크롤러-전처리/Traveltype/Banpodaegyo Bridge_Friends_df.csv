1,3.0,"I went there with high expectations and was a bit disappointed. It wasn't as colorful as i imagined, it was just a really long water fountain.The park near it was nice to hang out at night though. Lots of food stalls are open and there are live performances too."
2,4.0,"It's great for picnic on Spring or Fall. You can enjoy the fountain also at night, but it's only beautiful after the sunset. Luckily there was a firework when I visited the bridge, so it's mire beautiful."
3,2.0,"The descriptions make it seem like a place you really want to go, but I was disappointed when I saw the 'show'. They play music and the fountain moves up and down a bit and does a wave pattern and that's pretty much it. You can barely see the coloured lights. I loved the buildings on the other side of the road, though. They change colours too and look beautiful."
4,5.0,This is a fantastic way to end your night in Seoul while looking along the Han River and enjoying the water light show! The show is every night for 20 mins on the right side of the bridge. There are shops nearby to grab some snacks while waiting for the show. Be sure to arrive at least 5 mins early for good seats on the weekdays and at least 30 mins on the weekends. You can get here by getting off at the Express bus Terminal Station and walking less than a mile down to the park.
5,4.0,"Beautiful and smelly, colorful and crowded place. However, I am in love with this landmark of Seoul!Definitely this place is very romantic. What’s interesting that this place doesn’t have asian style :)I would visit this place again and again."
6,4.0,"I was just there on Saturday evening and truly enjoyed the light fountain show. We were lucky to see also the fireworks by the bridge. Even though it was raining on Saturday evening, the rain and muggy weather added to the charm of the colorful fountain show. Would recommend it to others"
7,2.0,"According to the official Korea tourism website it said that there will be light show on weekdays during this season, my friend and i arrived and waiting for the show to start at 8&8:30pm but it did not happen at all. Felt it was a waste of our time and effort to come all the way here though there are other nice views around as well."
8,5.0,I had a good time actually in this place because when i visited here there's a small concert in their area with urban zakapa there ! There's also some food bazaar and the bridge is so beautiful in the night
9,3.0,"If you are simply traveling through Seoul, this attraction may be somewhat of a disappointment but for locals or those truly interested in experience life in Seoul, the Banpo Bridge Rainbow Fountain (반포대교 달빛무지개분수) is a great spot for a date night or time out with friends/family. It is quite far of a walk from the subway station so you may want to take a taxi to get here. I came at night with some friends and was surprised by the lively festival-like vibe that I got. There were market vendors, food trucks, and live music adding to the Rainbow Fountain Show off of the bridge."
10,2.0,"After seeing photos of the Banpodaegyo, named the rainbow fountain, I decided to come here. There were quite a number of people sitting along the river waiting for the fountains so we joined them as well. I was so disappointed when it started because it was basically a fountain with white lights and music and the back. Don't come here if you are expecting a rainbow fountain, it's nothing like that. The night was saved by fried chicken delivery... hahaha"
11,4.0,"What I love in Seoul in the night is right there, I enjoyed my night time with my friends, we gathered and had some talks.. kinda night picnic. There were a lot of people there.. we can see beautiful water fountain every night.. when I went there, I ordered some chicken and cola to make up my good times there. I ordered by phone and its very close to public transportation.. the place is very wide to take some site.. its kinda picnic :)"
12,4.0,"We had a bit of trouble finding the bridge as a highway is right beside the coast and we couldn't find the way to cross the highway. Luckily we managed to find a local who could speak good english and he directed us to the bridge.When we arrived, we thought we were at the wrong bridge because it looked like a normal bridge that couldn't conduct a water show. We were on our way to the other, more lit-up and colourful bridge when the music suddenly played and we realised that we were at the right place. There was a group of people ballroom dancing while the people sitting on the steps watched. The atmosphere of the place was chill and great, but the water show average as water was just pouring from the bridge off-sync from the music that was playing. The water bank was also very dark due to the lack of street lamps."
13,5.0,"If you have no plan in the night and you still have more energy, i suggest you to visit this place. Theres a rainbow water fountain with the korean songs as a backsound. So many couple here, bcs the view really pretty. So any of you can enjoy the korean songs with a beautiful view. This place surrounded by citylight from the building around the bridge. And it was awesome"
14,2.0,"It's their daily show last around 10 min , nothing fantastic . Except the sunset on the other site packed with locals with tent ⛺️."
15,2.0,"Nearer to Express Bus Terminal station compared to Donjak station. A relaxing place to unwind. Due to the rain (well, it's actually drizzle), they planned to cancel the show but the show was up ten minutes after the announcement. Only one side of the bridge had the water fountain with display lights and out of tune music. Not that entertaining but good initiatives though to build up the water fountains on a bridge."
16,5.0,"This is my favorite place in Seoul. I visited this place twice, because the first one i couldn't see the rainbow fountain. Its is located next to Some Sevit/Floating Island/ Some Sevit is on the left side and the rainbow fountain is on the right side of the bridge.Rainbow fountain will start around 8PM and the last will be around 9.30PM.  This place is crowded with young people. Here you can just sit, watch the crowd, taking photos, cycling, etc. For me, sitting while chit chat-ing with my friends is one of the best thing i did. We brought snacks and beer cans too. After a long walk around Seoul, this place is best to relax and enjoy the night view of Seoul."
17,4.0,"The light show itself was pretty, with different colors, music, and spurts of water from the side of the bridge. My friends and I ordered food from the many delivery guys waiting around the area and ate it at the stairs (viewing area). I think most of the locals do this. Expect to see a lot of couples! Bring a jacket because it might get chilly at night while waiting for the show. The bridge is near Floating Island, a filming location for Avengers 2. While waiting for the light show, you might want to check it out. It's at the left side of the bridge! :)From Dongjak station exit 1 or 2, you will have to walk a lot before reaching Banpo bridge. Getting off at the Express Bus Terminal station might be nearer and more convenient."
18,1.0,"I was being hosted with my friend and she swore it was beautiful and colorful when she first saw it a year before. Maybe it gets better in peak season, but honestly it was very underwhelming and not worth the metro fare to get there in my opinion. Yes the water flows very nicely from the bridge but there is no color and it does not look like it does on Google. Maybe if seen from above?   Also the music wasn't even loud enough to hear."
19,3.0,"The Moonlight Rainbow Fountain is the world's longest bridge fountain[6] that set a Guinness World Record with nearly 10,000 LED nozzles that run along both sides that is 1,140m long, shooting out 190 tons of water per minute. Installed in September 2009 on the Banpo Bridge, former mayor of Seoul Oh Se-hoon declared that the bridge will further beautify the city and showcase Seoul's eco-friendliness, as the water is pumped directly from the river itself and continuously recycled. The bridge has 38 water pumps and 380 nozzles on either side, which draw 190 tons of water per minute from the river 20 meters below the deck, and shoots as far as 43 meters horizontally.This is what you will see if you visited Banpo bridge at night. Popular for film or musical video shot, its a nice place to visit only when you have time to spare!"
20,4.0,"If you think a water & light show spewing from a bridge is absurd, I would ask you to think again. They play very calming music and the water dances to the beat. The surrounding area is nice and a lot of people come here to see the show and walk around the park. It's about a 10 minute walk from the nearest station but it's something nice to do especially if you're a tourist who can't get this type of attraction back home."
21,5.0,One of the nicest place in Seoul to relax and enjoy! The fountain on the bridge was simply fantastic!
22,3.0,"If you're wondering what to do in Seoul during night time, maybe you may consider visiting this bridge. Please note that this place is quite far from subway station (the nearest one is Express Bus Terminal, CMIIW) and you still have to walk for about 1km to reach this bridge... So prepare your foot! This place is quite crowded in the night esp because I visit during spring. If you want to watch its rainbow fountain, make sure you check the schedule. Dont expect much about the fountain because basically it's just water falling from some pipes attached to the bridge with some colorful lights. And they give some familiar backsound during the fountain show (SNSD's Gee is one of it). This bridge is instagram-worthy tho."
23,2.0,"All the available information refers to it as Banpo Bridge Rainbow Fountain and suggests you catch the Subway to Dongjak (Line 4, exit 1 or 2) however, this is very misleading for the locals.  From my experience, no one seemed to know which direction it was in or how to find it.  I exited the Subway as specified and hoped to see a sign, arrow etc - there was nothing.  I asked a few locals and no one had a clue.  Then, I stumbled across some other tourists also looking for the Bridge and we went around in circles for 45 mins before we finally found someone who pointed in the opposite direction.  We started walking and it became apparent that this Bridge was a good 2.5km from the subway.  If you are not up for a walk in the dark get a cab and ask the driver to take you to Sebit Dungungseom (Floating Island in Hangang Park)...better yet, have your hotel write this in Korean for you and don't bother with the subway at all.  My fellow travelers gave up so I felt like I was on a wild goose chase...About 20 minutes later I came across some more travelers who looked lost and they walked with me for a while become also giving up...Over an hour and a half from arriving at the Dongjak subway, I arrived! What a joke. By this stage, I had lost all interest in the rainbow fountain but still had time to see it as it commences at 8, 8.30 and 9pm from April through October.The Floating Island has a large outdoor screen that was showing baseball and pathways to various restaurants, sporting areas. It was a hive of activity, as I imagine the Hangang Park would be during the day with all the bike and walking tracks.Keep walking past this as the sitting area for the Rainbow Fountain is under the Bridge across the road. There were about 50 people waiting for the fountain to start, some with professional cameras etc. To be honest, the actual show was a let down, but maybe my lack of interest was due to the palava in getting there. I stayed for 15 mins and then saw a taxi dropping off people so made a run for it.If I had kids with me it might be fun or if you were looking for a few hours to kill one night go for it but overall, I was disappointed."
24,5.0,"very close to the express terminal station... i believe 10 min from the station exit. If it rains alot, the fountain will not be activated. The fountain show during summer is around 7:30.. 8:00 and maybe at 9? at around 8'oclock you are going to be faced with bunch of tour boats near the fountain. I recommend having a small picnic while watching the fountain show. there are good amount of spaces to sit around unless during the weekedend.. very crowded."
25,5.0,"There are shows every half an hour, each lasting 20mins. Essentially it means 10mins without any activity. IMPORTANT: Fireworks on the 8pm show every Saturday only! The fireworks was a good 10-15mins long. If you can adjust your schedule, do pop over at this time!Sadly, unable to purchase chicken and beer to enjoy. However, you may wish to pop over to CNN Cafe just 2mins away."
26,3.0,"This particular attraction was not quite what I expected. Perhaps it was the timing of the sunset and light show that was off, but the colors weren't as bright and vibrant as they appeared in photos on Google. There were tons of people, and the atmosphere was great! Tons of couples and young adults, and I would totally suggest this attraction for the romantic."
27,4.0,"Rushed to see this place, it was rather relaxing but the surrounding has nothing much, no food found for me and my hungry friend. But just the view of it is amazing. Because i love rainbow so much, i give it a 4stars! :DWould be much better if there's some food and drinks selling in this location."
28,3.0,"If you just been from a long walk all day and decided to make this as your last stop for the day, be prepared for quite a long walk from subway, unless you'll take a taxi. The place was relaxing and a usual hang out for friends, families, couples or even someone on his own. I was a bit disappointed when we went there because some lights were not synchronized with the others and can be clearly noticed swaying differently. The music was so-so. Some of it were matching but some were a bit odd to be included in it."
29,5.0,From April to October you can see the longest bridge fountain in the world with 380 jets in different colors. You can also see colored floating buildings near there.To get there: Walk out of exit 8-1 at Express Bus Terminal Station (Lines 3 & 7). Walk straight 300 meters. Then cross large intersection (under overpass). Turn right and then walk 600m to entrance of Hangang Park.
30,5.0,"I went here with my friends, but you'll see a LOT of couples here. The fountain starts every half hour from 8pm. If you go here with friends I recommend you bring some pizza, chicken, beer, or anything basically. If you can speak Korean or have Korean friends you can even ask them to call and deliver to your location."
31,4.0,"It's a nice place to go after shopping at express bus terminal underground mall. After exiting from the underground, there's no more direction board but all you need to do is just walk straight along the roadside for about 10mins to reach banpodaegyo bridge. You can also buy some foods or drinks to have a river side picnic at there.(will pass by GS25 while heading to banpodaegyo bridge). If you're Chimac ( chicken and beer) fans, there's a chimac delivery service at there. The most important things is  make sure the lightshow schedule before you going. Quite crowded during weekend but nice view and very relaxing."
32,4.0,"Banpo Rainbow Bridge is not the usual kind of tourist attraction where you head there, gasp in awe and take pictures then leave. Its more of the experience of being there and enjoying the place as a whole. For a 1 liner review: Its a bridge with water jets spraying from the side with random songs playing in the background... **Most pictures you seen online are heavily contrast adjusted, lights are techically not as strongly coloured.BUT I believe its also the only place a tourist can order chicken to be delivered to you without making a phonecall. As you are walking towards the park, there will be many Ahjjusshis riding scooters circling the area like vultures handing out flyers. Pizzas, fried chicken, grilled chicken and beer is all available. Just let them know what you want, pay them and tell him where you will be seated. Everything will be delivered to you in 30min or so.It is rather a long walk from Express Bus Terminal Station, abt 15-20min. Directions are exactly as described on the official KTO site. Express Bus Terminal Station (Seoul Subway Line 3,7 or 9), Exit 8-1.Go straight for 250m, and turn right at the Express Bus Terminal 4-way intersection.Continue going straight for 400m and cross the road you were walking along.Go straight through the underpass to arrive at the parkIf not, take Bus 740 from either Seocho Station (Line 2) or Noksapyeong Station (Line 9), it will stop you directly at Banpo Hangang Park.SUGGESTION::: - Head over there if you are with a bunch of family / friends or special someone for a picnic.bring a mat (buy from Daiso) or just sit on the concrete steps!!!- Order chicken and beer from the Ahjjusshis!!! Be like how the locals are when you're there~~~ or bring your own food~~~ - Be there abt 6.30pm to catch the sunset, first fountain show is at 7pm on weekdays.** I highly suggest to stay on for the later shows, lights should be more intensed when the skies are darker."
33,3.0,"It's best to sit by the edge of the river. Bring some snacks so you have something to eat while enjoying the show since there were no places to buy food when we got there. It's a nice show to visit but I would not recommend it if you have a very tight schedule. It is really more of a ""relaxing, enjoy the scenerery"" type of attraction. If you have spare time at night, after shopping perhaps, I would recommend to visit this place just to unwind. If you don't have time, it's alright, you won't miss much."
34,4.0,Romantic rainbow fountain with great musics and lightings! Really worth a visit.We follow the directions given by the official website to alight at subway stn Dongjak only to found out that it's a 2km walk to Banpodaegyo and took us an hour to reach. Pathway is very dark and no signage at all. Luckily a helpful ahjumma walk with us to to the bridge.Later on we found out the nearest subway station is actually EXPRESS BUS TERMINAL STN which is abt. 20 mins walk. so pls do not go to Dongjak Stn.Do check online for the schedules of the showtime. It is not available from Nov - Mar.
