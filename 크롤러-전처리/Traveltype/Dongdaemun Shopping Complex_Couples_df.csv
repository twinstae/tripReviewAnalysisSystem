0,3.0,"It's a textile complex, all floors. One will go to for all textile material requirement.Definitely, NO SOUVENIRS to find here (no trinkets, key chains, nail clippers, ref magnet)."
1,3.0,"The area is strictly for shopping and you could bargain at the retail stores. The crowd was not as heavy since our last visit four years ago; due to on line shopping and less Chinese tourists. We visited couple of complexes, which on certain levels the numbers of shop employees outnumbered the shoppers."
2,3.0,"Most of the ladies clothes ranges 20000won to as high as 75000won in gd morn city, dongdaemun , apm place. Don‚Äôt expect to have big bargains thou. Discounts mostly 5-10k won. Some nicer seller might allow alittle more discount. Orelse a blouse is 40-48k won. Skirts 20k to 58k depending if it‚Äôs on sale.Gotten some cheap buys but some expensive ones that I gave it a miss. Sellers are quite firm with their last price. Quality is good for some but with that prices, we cAn easily shop in SG malls. So if ya looking for some pretty clothes yes it‚Äôs a nice place. Basically just be prepared that each clothes is estimated at sgd30-50.Hope this gives a latest update on the clothes price here^^"
3,4.0,"I could happily have spent all day in the mall which sells fabrics. There is a fantastic range of all types of material, as well as haberdashery, bedding, soft furnishings, even rugs. If you love to sew this is the place to go."
4,3.0,"Dongdaemun is a popular shopping and tourist destination where people go to because of the traditional markets and shopping centers. It has around 26 shopping malls over ten blocks, 30,000 specialty shops, and 50,000 manufacturers. The area is open for almost the whole day (10:30am -5:00am) and some stores are open 24hours but most shops close on Mondays and Holidays .  Another place to go to is the DDP complex which has a fantastic architecture composed of undulating surfaces that resemble the flow of liquid and allow the flexibility in space."
5,5.0,"located in the central. many shops, markets, malls, and whole sale market. very big area with all types of products specially clothes. there is also a night market. you need 1 full day to cover the area.must visit  place for shopaholic."
6,4.0,This place is for shopaholics who love bargain sales. We were able to buy a lot from this place and good quality products especially if it's made in Korea. We will visit this place when we go to Seoul again üòäüòèüëè
7,3.0,Another shopping mall with luxury brands that will cost you an arm and a leg.  If your wife wants another expensive bag or you want an expensive bag then come here.
8,4.0,"My wife headed straight for this shopping centre as advised be one of her friends.Lots of shops selling what most trendy young women want. A must for the ladies and The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf on the second floor is a great place for the husbands to sit, relax, enjoy a drink and watch the birds go by."
9,4.0,"we can buy all types apparels for all ages, innerwear, socks, speacial dresses etc., in whoesale price."
10,5.0,"Dongdaemun shopping district is a bomb! (according to my wife) I had to drag her outta there in the end because if I didn't she was gonna buy the whole shopping center... she said their prices are unbelievably cheap compare to other shopping centers. If you like to be bumped into by strangers, then this is place for you.. You'll run into a lot of Chinese tourists here... they have so much moola they will buy the whole darn shopping centers. I do NOT like shopping, nor crowded places but I was being a nice husband this night and endure the pain of shopping with my wife... she thanked me afterwards and earned a nice round of golf for being a nice hubby~~ yes!"
11,3.0,"This differentiate from all the other underground shopping alleys we have been.If you can't find anything you fancy underground, there is a building with many floors and endless aisles where only fabrics are sold, not the finished products. The choices would fill the spectrum of rainbow and beyond!Opposite this block, there is another monstrous building with rows of clothes--kids, adults and Korean costumes, men and women fashion boutiques filled out every floor to the nth degree.Do bargain if you intend to buy in bulk. It is hard to contemplate these hard working Koreans sitting in their little enclosure, competing with everyone else selling similar products. This is where some will stand out with their special attractive collections in this maze, the problem is having time and orientation to discover them because they are  hidden in the labyrinth. My advice is buy it immediately if you like it, for it would be impossible to compare prices and you might not be able to find your way back!Do have a break and enjoy the little food stalls just outside"
12,4.0,"Yeah this place is nuts. Perfect for ladies who need to get their shopping fix in. First time we visited, we were walking around and I was listening to their public announcement, 'Open until 5am.'5am. Usually I'm on my way to work by then! Doota seems to be the more fashionable building while the rest seem more like the apparel you see at night markets. The prices are not as cheap as we thought at first and it seems to be catered towards the China tourists."
13,3.0,"We first visited the Pyoung Hwa Clothing Market but most of the stalls were closed.  From those still opening for business, we knew that it was just a local low end shopping mall.  We thus turned to another side where there were many department stores.  Again, no surprises."
14,3.0,"There are a number of departmental stores in this area, e.g. Lotte Fitin, Dooda, Migliore, Hello APM, Good Morning City, etc.  It will be quite impossible to cover all of them within a short period of time, unless you have a lot of time in hand.  We would normally choose 2 to 3 departmental stores and spent about 2 to 3 hours looking for good bargains.  We arrived in the late afternoon and visited Lotte Fitin and Hello APM specifically for ladies clothings. We managed to buy some cloths ranging from KRW10,000 to KRW30,000.  Don't be afraid to bargain as this is normal in some of the departmental stores."
15,1.0,"First of all, we had this misconception that Dongdaemun is another street market. The area is very confusing. After several rounds of asking different people, and being told different timing of the business opening hours, we finally realised that Dongdaemun area is mainly made up of a street that is lines with a few major shopping malls!!!We went to a few of the malls and were quite disappointed that they do not have much to offer. Doota is totally over rated! There are not much to see or buy. And the prices are not cheap at all. We even went to the whole sale complex just round the corner, mistaking it for Dongdaemun market. And they sell all winter scarves, hats and older women clothes!!. Anyway, I will not recommend this place at all. It's a waste of time."
16,4.0,"Tons of clothing goods for being delivered to China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and other places. This is the shopping paradise for Korean cheap clothing shoppers! Open from 10am to 6am next day... There is always people here. Not recommend for family trips, it's crowded and it is not easy walk inside."
17,3.0,"Like its mentioned by other reviewers, I have same opinion, its not cheap at all.Size is another issue everything is UK size6/8/10. People from other parts of the world are not as lucky as locals here. They need to keep the up sizes as well for tourists.It‚Äôs like the whole building corner has something or the other to sell.Its fun!"
18,4.0,Thousands of shops from simple market stalls to boutique fashion brands available.  The place almost never closes.  Put aside a lot of time and don't forget to haggle in the market style shops.
19,5.0,"One more very important place for tourists and residents as well, is surely the Dongdaemun Shopping Complex.It is located along the one, rather, long portion of the Jongno Street (due to its width, it might be called the Jongno Boulevard or Avenue).Here we loved to go forth and back along these commercial large buildings, purposed for trading with the completely different goods. There are here the traditional markets and very modern and popular shopping centers as well. And since it shortly became a popular shopping and tourist destination, it is properly indicated as Special Tourism Zone. The masses of people are going here in all directions, making the impression of some human hives,  gazing at the products and purchasing them. And those products range from silks and fabric ,over the clothes and shoes, leather goods, sporting goods, then plumbing and electronics, toys, luxury watches, and food areas, specialising in Korean cuisine. The choice is really abundant one.We, in the group, had been in this paradise for buyers, several times and every time enjoyed."
20,2.0,"I think Dongdaemun is overrated... The malls are floors and floors of rows and rows of nearly identical clothes. Now that I think about it, It's quite similar to Platinum mall in Bangkok. The clothes styles were not to my liking, the quality isn't great, and the prices aren't very cheap! You have to bargain..once you find something you like, the storekeeper will enter the price on a calculator and hand it to you.. you enter your 'preferred price' and hand the calculator back..you go to and fro a few times until you arrive at the lowest price they are willing to sell at. I think this is a waste of time, are there really people out there who 'enjoy' this bargaining process? @_@Although it's great that some malls are 24 hours, if you really shop until the wee hours, you have to taxi back to the hotel which will cost you a fortune.Overall I think it's more suitable for wholesale/ people who operate clothing stores overseas to purchase their inventory."
21,4.0,A great place not far from the city center for shopping clothes. A wide range of quality and stylesRecommended for a rainy day in Seoul.
22,4.0,"There were lots of street food to explore, mini concerts outside of the mall, and just overall walking and shopping marathon! My best friend and her husband just touched down that evening from Melbourne and that was the first place we went to, together with me and my husband. Knowing that most of the malls closes at 2.30am and some at 4.30am, and some food joints are opened 24hours, we were just taking our own time and strolling and snapping photos away, and wondering into most of the malls. Until we were dead tired, and decided to call it a night/morning!"
23,4.0,"If you can't sleep at night and love shopping, this is a must-go place for you! I would say this give me a very similar experience to the ones in Bangkok. Do bargain!"
24,2.0,"When we visited on a Friday afternoon, we were surprised to find it quite empty. The things sold were quite pricey and language was a problem. Before of the low-traffic, the shopkeepers were either napping or playing with their phones...wasted our time going.."
25,3.0,"Place is filled with a lot of everything to shop for especially clothes. If you're a shopaholic, one day is NOT ENOUGH. The first time I came here I was overwhelmed by the place :), so I prepared a shopping list in my 2nd trip here. Made my life so much easier and I got what I wanted at a bargain (winter clothing and jackets). But then again there are so many things that are sold here so prepare plenty of time buffer, cash and comfy shoes. Downside is that I had to do a lot of bargaining - some things are not cheap..especially if they know you're a tourist ;)"
26,3.0,A ton of shopping options everywhere in the area with a lively street market open at night. Clothes should cater to all ages though they aren't exactly cheap.
27,5.0,We and my wife come here often during the day but this was our first time coming at night to attend the midnight market. Holy Moly this place is ridiculous at night. A different world of shopping. Go down the alleys by the stream and those buildings are happening. People with huge shopping bags dragging the ground. Got to save up some more pennies to take the mrs here again lol. Let her shop until she drop.
28,5.0,"There are 5 shopping centres around here. Give the ones the both ends a miss and visit the 3 in between. You will not regret, it's huge with small individual stalls that sells quality korean clothings at cut-throat prices.  If you don't like to bargain, only visit stalls that have price tags prominently displayed on all merchandise. If you are visiting stalls that don't display price tags on merchanise, the asking price is normally doubled that of what they really want, so bargain by offering only 50% of the asking price and walk away if the stall owners refuse. There will definitely be another stall selling the same merchandise."
29,3.0,"The wholesale pricing here is higher than those shops in night markets. Maybe they know we are tourists and jacked up the prices, however the price tagged states otherwise.Nothing much to see, just enjoy how business is done."
30,5.0,"My first trip to Seoul, & Dongdaemun comes up often as ""The"" shopping complex to go to for serious shopping. Before anything, please note that Dongdaemu  is NOT the place to go to for global designer brands. Instead, its the place to go to for Local Korean designer brands and for those wanting to satisfy a Knock-off craving. There are several complexes that offer shopping treats; I only got to see two buildings, Migliore and Doota. Doota is a ""high end"" mall that offer good quality Korean local designers. The pricing is up there with the global brands, but the quality is also pretty good. I would recommend to go to Doota last, since some of the items there are also available in Migliore, for a cheaper price.Migliore is similar to Platinum Fashion Mall in Bangkok. The wares are better in terms of quality over cheap China sourced goods. Bargaining is encouraged in Migliore. Cash is also king. Migliore is highly recommended for those with slim Asian type builds. Just be careful and inspect the goods first before purchasing. Lower cost means less quality control. Be patient, & bargains can be found in Migliore.The good thing about these shops is they close at 5am. Crowds are significantly less after 11pm. Good to also try the street food that crop up outside these malls. They are cheap, clean and delicious. Taxis are readily available outside."
31,3.0,The shopping possibilities are endless in this area. It might be difficult to find the places that sells items to your liking among all the rest. What I did not like was the loud music banging from each store.
32,3.0,"My assessment of this attraction as ""average"" needs to be taken into context. I've lived in Asia for many tears and have experienced a lot of markets so, coming to this area, I wasn't particularly surprised by anything.The area itself has a large number of large indoor markets and stores and, if you had the time and inclination, you could easily spend days here.Of the couple of markets I visited, looking for men's clothing, I left without buying anything. Many of the vendors are selling exactly the same stock and the variety of clothing and accessories was not  great and the quality not impressive.Having said that, there are much more choices available for female fashion and accessories, and I did not visit all the markets in the area so could have missed something really good.If you haven't been to a place like this before it is worth a quick visit. There are a lot of food vendors around the locality and, if you fancy a bit of culture there is a good cultural centre and exhibition space just opposite Doota."
33,5.0,"Had a blast shopping in Dongdaemun - this is where you should be if you want to make some serious shopping of high fashion ladies apparel all made in Korea! Enjoyed it so much! Some store owners are very friendly- they allow haggling prices - but usually their prices are fixed. If you are tight on the budget - look through the onSale racks - $10,000 items are equally good!Some store owners are impatient - when you look through their sale items n keep on asking the prices - they will start folding all the items you looked through n seem not want  to sell to you - hahahha - I bit rude I think- but that's how they are- prideful people.Lots of places to eat too!"
34,3.0,"It is the Korea version of Bugis St in Singapore. Shops aplenty but most are selling the same stuff. Not very cheap and not easy to haggle prices either, especially if they know that you are a tourist. Surprisingly I can find the exact same products online at cheaper prices."
35,3.0,"Located next to JW Marriot, this complex mainly houses stalls selling fabrics, ribbons, lace, and bedsheets etc.  To be honest, there are better options, including the underground passage near Dongdaemun subway.   For jewellery etc, you should go over to Doota or Migliore.  My wife loved these two places so much that we were there for two hours while she browsed and bought several pieces.  I must admit some of them are good, but still a little prices.   But do not leave the area without visiting the Dongdaemun Design Centre across the road.  It's a fantastic building in terms of architectural aesthetics, and also houses a design museum, a lounge and several lovely displays of furniture and plants etc."
36,4.0,"Visited Dongdaemun on a very rainy day. This complex is enormous - the building we were in was 1km from end to end. The floor we were on was mainly for clothes and accessories for the more mature. There was a huge selection, and the clothes were very well made and cheaper than the UK. There is another building selling items for the young. You can certainly spend the whole day shopping there and it is easily reached on the metro."
37,3.0,"There are a few main stores that make up the shopping in this area. First, the Pyounghwa clothing market - cheaper clothes in a street market style setup with lots of vendors pressuring you to buy. Prices are negotiable and I found you can get at least 30% off without much trouble - more if youre good. we found out the hard way that its closed on Saturdays.  Go figure.Second, Doota. More like a mall/department store feel with different items on each floor (ie. Mens, women, cosmetics, etc.). They are closed Sundays and normally open around 7pm.Next, migliore. A mix between Pyounghwa market and doota. Cheap prices in a department store setting but made up of market vendors. Also negotiable.Lotte young plaza: the highest quality and prices of the bunch. A nice department store like other Lottes but with fashion catering to younger people.  Also cheaper than other Lottes.Most of these stores open until quite late (4am)."
38,5.0,"Great place to buy local designed fashion items, wife purchased a bit within the shopping complex. You could shop all day, caters for everyone of all ages. Products are priced well, don't expect the major brands like LV etc...."
39,4.0,This place is the one to go if you want fabric for traditional costumes or just fabric in general. Make sure to go with someone who knows as it can be a bit difficult to locate. The little instant food shops in this market are well known for the pancakes.
40,5.0,"If you are into clothes/shoes/accesorry shopping then this is probably one of the best places in Asia for shop till you drop.  No other city caters to shopping in the wee hours of the morning like Dongdaemun.  Most malls start getting ready around 8pm and things kick off around 10pm all the way until 5am in the morning.  Wholesalers from around Asia come here to get the latest in Korean fashion.  Even if you are not a shoppaholic, this place is still worth seeing the surreal scene of young women hauling duffel bags and the wholesaler system they have with long-distance buses.There are 2 parts to this area.  The popular malls like Doota that many of the Chinese tour groups follow, and then the other side of the street where there are a series of malls that cater to the young hip crowd looking for the latest Korean styles.  Many young women run their own brands here hoping to make it big.  Of course you also get your ""fake"" stuff which is par of the course anywhere in Asia.Last subway train from the station here is about 12:30am so was our nightly stop before calling it a night to our hotel.  It is about 3 subway stops from Lotte Department Store and on the circle subway route.  There are some of your typical night snack stalls here."
41,3.0,"You have not been to Seoul if you have not been to Dongdaemun Shopping area. Most tourists come to Dongdaemun for shopping at night as it's open till wee hours (like 5am) in the morning.  There are actually 2 sections of Dongdaemun shopping complexes. The section that most tourists visit are located on the side of Doosan Tower, such as Yes APm, Migliore  and housed small retailers. The other section, nearer to the Dongdaemun Stadium is meant for wholesalers. If you have a few friends and would like to buy a few pieces together, then you should visit malls like Designer Club, Migliore Valley which you can probably spot better buys. I do find that the fashion at Dongdaemun a bit too young for me. I read that Jeil Pyeonghwa caters more to working ladies in 30s-40s.You do find some good buys here but you need patience, and good stamina as you really need to browse through the shops slowly. With every shopping mall with almost 10 levels, it would definitely require some stamina and patience. Another tip is to look out for stall owners who are genuine in doing your business and you can get some good bargains. You would definitely encounter some who are not so friendly, but there are also gems to be spotted. Read More:http://snewthewanderlust.blogspot.sg/2013/04/dongdaemun-cheongyecheon-stream.html"
42,4.0,"Oh yes, tonnes & tonnes of shops. But do you know that those shops that directly line the walkway have plenty of customers browsing through & thus, the staff are not willing to lower the price for you??? Besides, their customer service skill is lacking. I tried browsing at a few shops & this was what I found out, so I intentionally walked to a shop whose shop front does not face the crowded walkway. And guess what? The staff was friendlier & more willing to please customers. I managed to haggle & get a lower price for my Korean style dress.If you come in winter, the shopping complex switches off its air conditioning. So it was really warm & stuffy inside. And it is very inconvenient to walk around carrying your jacket should you choose to take it off as you will want to touch & hold your must-buy items.Do take note that you cannot try on the clothes here because they are afraid that your make-up will ruin their clothes. So you can only put the clothing in front of your body & estimate the fit.Do note that not every item here is made in Korea. Just like in AU, a lot of the items are made in China. So don't think that just because you bought xxx here, it must be made in Korea. Don't be carried away by shopping euphoria & READ the label."
43,5.0,"This is my fave place during my visit to Seoul!My BF and I came back here 3 days just to do shopping for clothes!The clothes are all of good quality!There are different shopping malls along the line, from the expensive ones to the cheaper ones. So please compare before buying!You can do some haggling.Female clothing are generally on the cheap to affordable range.Whereas, clothing for men are more expensive. If you go and notice, the stalls selling men clothing do not put any price tag. They kind of hike up the price once they know you are a foreigner. Hence please haggle if you can!My BF bought a simple long sleeve shirt for around 25,000won from Migliore and then when we went to Goodmorning city, the same design, same material, same size is going at 10,000 won.Overall, both of us love this place."
44,5.0,"Yes, you read that right...24hrs shopping! Shopping in the dongdaemun area has pretty updated fashion plus prices are on the cheaper side. You don't have to waste your precious daytime shopping cuz many of the shops in this area open through the night. That's good for people who want to squeeze in more time to visit some scenic or cultural places that are only open during the day. Definitely recommended!!"
45,4.0,"You can find fantastic bargins here, It's a virtual shopping paradise for the ladies. The guy's can find it the same way here provided you are built like the average Korean man.... However that's just not the case for most of us westerners and will find a day at Dongdaemun more like a treasure hunt.The best plan of action to find that great bargin for us chaps who weigh in excess of 140 lbs soaking wet is to go with a specific item in mind, say a nice winter coat or jacket for example. This way you only have to bother sticking your nose in the clothing racks where you have a fighting chance of finding exactly what you are looking for... Chances are they will have exactly what you want, you have to look for it, and besides, you have to be here with your wife or girlfriend anyway so you might as well make it a productive day for yourself as well....  It is very ill advised for a western guy to try and just wing it here, The place is just too massive and the lack of larger sizes too frustrating that unless you seriously narrow your focus you are very likely to come away with a happy wife, sore feet, and not a thing for yourself to make it all seem worth while..... talking from experience here :)"
46,3.0,"In many travel books the place is addressed as Dongdaemun market. So we expected a traditional type market. Asking the way, the answer was your in the middle of it. The area is covered with enormous shopping malls and must be woman's heaven... For a guy there's not much more to do than be surprised how the ladies ooh-ed and aah-ed at almost every item on sale..."
47,5.0,Hello APM was the best. Migliore was next. Should be at least one whole day to devour the whole area. Great location. But beware of expensive street food stalls.
48,4.0,"Although there are several buildings in these ""complex"" due to time constraints, we were able to only check out two adjacent buildings. We concentrated on Migliore which according to my daughter/guide has better offerings and lower price and more frequented by tourists and expats. I found that souvenir shopping here is cheaper than Insadong although looking at the total look of the environment, Insadong market prices should have been cheaper. If you will have time check out Migliore first before heading to Insadong. I could have save more on my souvenirs if I bought them here. Main problem anywhere in Korea is the language barrier. You can do your haggling by showing your numbers on the calculator and if your offer is reasonable and you are not rude you can get a great bargain especially if you are buying a lot of items. One thing I didn't like...their closed when we went back on a Monday!"
49,2.0,"I went there to get my winter clothing based on the reviews here that fashion are very inward and you can get them at a very cheap price over there. True enough, you are able to slash prices by 20-30% off at places such as Miglore and 40-50% at A/PM, i find that it's not a great feeling to shop there. The shop keepers were usually persistent and pushy, and even with the discount, i still feel like i have just been ripped off.In the end, to escape from the hassles of bargaining, we decide to get our stuffs from Doota, where the quality were thought to be better but comes with a higher price tag of course. I bought a trench coat at S$180 and leather knee high boot at S$180 as well. I know it's expensive. However, others were selling the boots at S300 at Doota. I thought that i already got a very good deal! Of course you can get boots at S$80-90 at Miglore and A/PM store for a lower quality. However, when i go to Coex shopping mall near my hotel, my heart dropped. I could easily get a better quality coat at the same price or boots at cheaper price. I never feel so ripped off in my entire life!All in all, i'm not sure if this is true only for winter clothing, you can easily get good ones at reputable shopping complexes over there. I feel that Dongdaemun has become touristy for our good, and the things there are overrated and over priced."
