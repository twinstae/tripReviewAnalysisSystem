0,5.0,"Trekked to the museum after coffee at the Hannam-dong area. The staff at the museum were very pleasant. Seeing that I was carrying a heavy bag, one of the staff shared about their free locker service which was very helpful. Caught the ongoing exhibition - Weather, which the theme is very easily relatable to all. I found myself finding familiar moments in my memory as I went through the exhibition. It was thoroughly enjoyable and well curated."
1,5.0,"很遠、很偏僻，從車站要走很久。但當天展覽很棒，覺得非常值得。也許有趣程度可能跟展覽內容有關，還有自身是否對藝術設計感到興趣，但我覺得這美術館的展覽品質很好。It’s far away from the subway station. But the exhibition was very nice. It worthies to come here. Maybe it’s depends on the exhibition and how the visitors are interested in art or design, but I think the quality of this museum’s exhibition is good."
