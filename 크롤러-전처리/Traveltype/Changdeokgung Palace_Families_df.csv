0,5.0,"It was free for the Christmas for all palaces . Changdeokgung has more intricate buildings than the larger palace in Seoul, despite the smaller sizes.Definitely worth a visit while in Seoul."
1,4.0,A huge place of Korea history in this place. Worth visiting. U can see lots of people wearing Hanbok costumes and taking photos here.
2,5.0,"We chose this palace to visit its biwon/secret garden. There was a discount if you bought combined entrance tickets and joined english speaking guide tour. After finished visiting a mesmerizing garden, we walked to gyeongbokgung palace to watch royal guard changing ceremony at 2p.m. for you to be able to do this, it is advisable for you to join changdeokgung palace tour at 9.30 a.m and subsequently secret garden tour at 11 a.m. the tour will be finished around 12.30 and you have ample time to return your rented hanbok."
3,4.0,"Visited the palace first before Gyeongbokgung.  Read reviews that this palace was designed to be in harmony with the environment and after arriving there, it can be observed as to how it is.  For a Palace, it is certainly not imposing as the Gyeongbokgung one and certainly no surprise why many princes chose to have their palace here.   Unfortunately, I did not follow any guided tour for the front part if the palace, thus may have missed much interesting snippets.  However the guided tour to the ""Secret Garden"" is a must.  Only entered with a guided tour, they are conducted at different times for different languages.  I say it's a must so when you visit, u can imagine how the palace designers have made much effort to be a environmentally harmonious building.  Do make a point to visit it."
4,5.0,The Huwon Secret Garden Tour is highly recommended for its gorgeous autumn foliage!!!  Only 100 tickets are available daily of which 50 are reserved for online booking. u need to create an account in order to book your tickets.The tour is highly restricted & u are not allowed to wander off by yourself. A guard will follow your group to ensure that everyone stays together.The guide is humourous and interesting. This tour is a must-do if u are in Seoul!!!
5,5.0,The palace was amazing and the architecture overall is really nice. Unfortunately we couldn’t go into the secret garden because the tickets were sold out. But the small lake and the rest of the park around the palace was really beautiful especially with the changing leaves of the trees.
6,4.0,Use the side entrance— no one is there and you don’t have to wait in the really long lines at the main entrance. For me and nieces it was 6k won. Game changer.
7,4.0,"We visited this place with two children.It is beautiful place and lots to see Highly recommend.Give enough time .Lots of walking .We took English speaking guide,Bit disappointed as she spoke very fast and did not allow group together to catch up.Go early as not to miss changing of guard and visit to Gardens. ."
8,4.0,"nice place for photoshoot with your hanbok.with hanbok, you go inside for free.i booked a secret garden tour and its nice but do this only if you have time. garden of morning calm is far better."
9,4.0,"This palace is huge. Slightly bigger in area then Gyeongbokgung but this is a UNESCO heritage site. A secret garden tour cost additional 5000W to the entrance fees of 3000W. The tour is conducted hourly and take you into the inner part of the palace compound with a guide who gives further insight and explanation. Here you will be able to see more pavilion, ponds and gardens. The tour takes 90 minutes and involved walking up and down the hilly path."
10,5.0,The palace has nothing special but is good for the Korean Traditional dress called Hanbok experience and photos. Just accors  the road ( opposite to this palace) there is a shop for Traditional dress rental. They charge around kRW 15000 for 2 hours rental for dress. They provide all facilities like rentals lockers within this price. Ladies hair dress is additional KRW 5000. Overall a good experience to go for this. Please also note that in case you are wearing the Traditional clothes the entry fee to palace is waived off. The place is easily accessible through public transport. The palace may be hot is summer and mostly uncovered in case of rain. So better carry an umbrella in summary or rainy season. No F&B option in palace. Better to carry your water bottles. They have washroom inside.
11,4.0,"Really enjoyed this trip, always like to tour round places like this, and this time it was a family tour, some of our members spoke Korean so we didn't need a tour guide"
12,4.0,"This is an absolutely beautiful palace, with gorgeous gardens. It is extremely peaceful and a wonderful place to spend an afternoon.We took the English guided tour and loved it. The palace is large and well cared for. You can't go inside the buildings which is too bad. I originally thought they were too  old but in fact most of the palaces in Seoul are reproductions. Every time Korea was invaded the palaces were torn down.The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the lack of accessibility for wheel chairs. They do provide wheelchairs but the one I used was not well maintained; it was extremely difficult to push and part way through the tour I had to turn back because of a staircase."
13,5.0,"This is the secondary palace, but has more sections that are authentic and not as rebuilt in the 1980s.  Really gorgeous and also like a nature hike in the middle.  The Secret Garden is a must-do part of the visit. The English-speaking guide who was assigned for everyone (you can't walk solo) was terrific, one of the best guides of my Seoul visit.  We found the palace fascinating and gorgeous, and it's not very far from Bukchon."
14,4.0,"A very beautifully decorated and in many ways a spectacular place. Old and full of history. Certainly worth a visit. The secret gardenis nice, but on the guided tour, which you must take to visit, you see mainly small temples and buildings, while the garden itself is really more a densely grown park. A little dissapointing. As is the palace surroundings which really are just grass and gravel. Very little you can see of the interior of the palace, so it is relatively quickly done unless you have a strong interest in 17c Korean architecture."
15,4.0,"Honestly by now I have gone through most of the palaces in Seoul and this one impressed me with its beauty and diversity. I do have to mention that to get into certain parts of the palace you need to pay again, but it doesn't lessen the value of the palace. It is simply beautiful to be there and very meditative. Simply go!"
16,5.0,"Visited with the student volunteers from Meteor Youth. The palace grounds are beautiful and the official hall with the emperor seat is stunning. Do make sure you book the tour for the secret garden. I would recommend you do the 90 mins tour of the secret garden first then visit the palace after. The gardens situated behind the grounds of the palace is huge and boasts many pavilions with beautiful ornate carvings, each with a different design. Do note that the tour entails a lot of walking uphill so be prepared. Another thing to note is that entrance to the secret garden and palace requires different ticket. The palace tickets also have different timings ie day ticket and evening tickets. I was glad I went with the student volunteers as they were able to provide commentary throughout the visit."
17,5.0,The different palaces and the Korean architecture is very fascinating. Very beautiful place and it feels like travelling to the past as I was walking and seeing different palaces.
18,5.0,"This palace is not smaller than Gyeongbokgung, but with the secret garden maybe the most beautiful one. Still always many tourists and local people, but not as crowded as Gyeongbokgung. Many photogenic spots, quiete enough to make good interesting instagram photos."
19,4.0,Glad that we sign up for this moonlight tour. The atmosphere at night was so different from the day where it was much more peaceful except that it can be quite scary if you're walking alone. It's so beautiful at night walking around with a lantern on hand. Get to see more of it and understand better from the guided tour despite having tour this place in the last trip.
20,5.0,"Our family went there as part of a group tour. I strongly suggest you get a guide or someone who is well versed in the palace's history. Seeing the place without knowing its history or ties to Korean culture is such a sad experience. And of course, there are so many places to walk around and gets pictures. From architecture, flora, staff in traditional costumes among others.We didn't get to rent or walk around in traditional korean clothes. That would have been awesome and probably the only downside we experienced of our visit."
21,5.0,"If you’re looking for a little history with beautiful scenery where kids can run around, this place is for you. Lots of tourists rent old Korean royalty costumes and explore the grounds like that, taking pictures. It’s relaxing and very pretty, signage is also in English but you could rent a live or audio tour if you want to learn more. A budget-friendly enjoyable experience."
22,4.0,"The place was beautiful, it was big and we weren't able to go around the whole place. There was a different payment for the palace itself and the secret garden, we decided not to go inside anymore as there were a lot of people in line for the tickets. It's a must-see if you love watching history K-dramas."
23,2.0,the hanbok renting opposite the palace offers worst experience for us for their services. did not recommend
24,5.0,"Nice place to see and understand about Korea architecture. Starting from the gate which  oposite the main gate of Green House, to the Museum and then straight to the palce. Incredible about the culture and structure of Korea"
25,4.0,I came here around 9.30 am and it wasn't crowded. The entrance ticket is 3000 Won for palace only and 5000 Won if it's include the ''Secret Garden'' area. The design is not too different with Gyeongbokgung Palace but nice to spend some time here.
26,1.0,"One of the attraction to visit, it is also close to shopping area and night market, close to train station and underground shopping area."
27,5.0,This palace is one of the Joseon Dynasty king's favorite and it is much beautiful and calmer than Gyeongbokgung since it is near the secret garden. It is the only palace in Seoul that has granted UNESCO World Heritage.
28,3.0,"Lots of building but all of the same decor, A lot of the place was destroyed by the Japanese and been refurbished. Still worth a walk around expect to spend around an hour. Changdeokgung place is adjacent to Changgyonggung Place with an inter connecting gate, there is an entrance fee for both places. So ideal to tie in at the same time. Over 65's have free entry on proof of age to both place.You can pay extra and have a guided tour of the secret garden which takes around 1.5 hours."
29,5.0,We decided to stroll through the gardens in full Hanbok.  We rented them from the little shop across the traffic lights from the front gate.  15000KW for 2 hours.We then wandered the palace grounds (free entry) taking pictures.  We were also asked to be in many other pictures from other tourists as we have very blond hair and blue eyes.   It was a great experience.The gardens were beautiful with Cherry Blossom blooming everywhere along the pathways. Well worth the visit.
30,5.0,You stroll around all the buildings and rooms where Royal family members once lived together with their own garden which is very unique in Korean garden design. You can go there via Metro line #3: Ankook station from where it takes 10 minutes' walk.
31,4.0,"Nearly didn’t come as we were already so tired from previous days including an earlier visit to Gyeongbokgung. Boy, am I glad I came! This to me is more beautiful and felt more authentic than Gyeongbokgung. As there were less visitors , we were able to wander around quietly at our pace. There also seemed to be better signages and explanation of the various venues at Changdeokgung. However some places were closed for renovation/ restoration. Could feel the weight of history on this place and to me, it felt sad and desolate. Did not manage to see the Secret Garden but will do so next time."
32,4.0,"I would recommend going here and visit it. It was worth it, and it was many things to look at. Definitely worth it"
33,5.0,Awesome to see the change over of the guards at the palace. Was a very special moment of history. thanks
34,2.0,"I have brought my family to Japan, Indonesia and Thailand... This palace is average and nothing fancy. My kids loved the changing of the guards ceremony, we went at I think 4pm. Nothing fancy..."
35,4.0,"Our walking tour of the secret garden in 昌德宫 was really enjoyable. We registered on-line to get the 10.00am slot. The weather was fantastic because it had been raining the day before. Besides the Autumn colors of the tress, our well experience tour guide told us stories and history of those traditional buildings. Our stay in insadong also gave us great convenience we can just take a 15 minutes healthy morning walk to the ticketing office of the Palace and the secret garden."
36,5.0,We went as part of half day tour of Seoul. The changing of the guard was a spectacle and all the people in traditional dress was something to behold. Our guide Jenifer was a very friendly person with good knowledge of the attractions we visited. Well worth a visit
37,5.0,Arrive early to buy tickets (or buy on-line) and catch the English Tour (other languages are available at different times). Be sure to also buy tickets for the Secret Garden extension.
38,4.0,This place was really cool - but would have appreciated it more if there were less people around! It was nice seeing an actual palace and the place was really huge! We only stayed here less than an hour because we had to return our hanboks. When you visit here it would be better if you have at least 2 hours so you can explore and enjoy the entire area! Also it would be a lot better to plan coming here not on a peak season like summer to avoid the crowd!
39,5.0,"Feel the uniqueness of beauty in Korea that does not seek glamor. Did you ever know the greatness of the Republic of Korea, which has never invaded other nations and has maintained a single nation for more than 5,000 years, despite constant foreign invasions?"
40,4.0,my mother and i visited the secret garden in autumn and it was really beautiful. i would recommend a short stroll along the palace before spending more time in the secret garden. please take note that you have to buy another ticket to enter the secret garden!
41,5.0,I went with my family   We toured the beautiful Palace and enjoyed the grounds and the Authenticity of the Palace
42,5.0,"I and my daughter walk along here, then we go outside from this palace, to  rent Korean dress 15000 Won  and more for rent 1hr or more. Many beautiful dresses with hat, handbags and ribbons."
43,5.0,"The palace and grounds are both commanding and pleasing to the eye. The secret garden tour was absolutely stunning. It was late November, and there were still leaves on the trees. Gorgeous reds, oranges, golds. Quiet walk with immersive views for contemplation and enjoyment. THE #1 highlight of our visit to Seoul, and there were many."
44,5.0,visit this palace to tour the huwon secret garden at an extra 5000W price. The gardens are quiet and beautiful.
45,5.0,"This palace had several entry points. We had to line up a bit for the tickets. There were so many tourists inside. This time, we did not have a guided tour.The palace was simple but beautiful but it was quite hard to find a quiet spot. The grounds were huge and the trees were beautiful during our autumn visit."
46,4.0,"We did not take a tour as they were all full when we got there. The buildings and the grounds are very pretty, however, they all do start to look the same if you have no idea what you are looking at. I would recommend waiting to take the guided tour if you can't speak the language so that you can appreciate what you are looking at."
47,5.0,"The palace itself is still okay. The gyeongbokgung palace is more grand than this.But the best part of this palace is the secret garden. I visited during autumn Nov 2019, it was beautiful as it truly shows the colour of autumn. My guide told me that the tickets to secret garden is not easy to get. Even he has to go pretty early to get them. This is the place we tried on the hanbok. There's 1 hanbok rental shop right across the street over the main gate. Hanbok rental is around 20,000 won and 5,000 won for hairstyles."
48,4.0,"If you are interested to see the autumn leaves in a palace setting, ensure to book the secret garden tour via online which is available one week before the actual date. This palace is not as pack as the Gyeongbukgung & has a nice garden with the autumn colors in place."
49,4.0,We miss out the secret garden but overall is a must visit place. Not bad and have a nice photo session but this is not the best palace in Seoul.
50,5.0,"We came here on Sunday and its not pack with people. The palace is huge.. We venture the entire palace only to find out that there is a visiting hours for SECRET GARDEN (another ticket is needed).We did not visit the SECRET GARDEN which i feel is better due to visiting hours (pls check on the tours for language ie. Japanese , English, Chinese etc)Must visit place"
51,5.0,The English tour guide was excellent and made the visit so much better. Worth a visit. Wish I had taken time out for the secret garden guided tour too.
52,4.0,"This was the first palace in Seoul we saw due to the Secret garden tour.  Tried to reserve online but it was closed; no problem buying tickets at the door though (you can’t visit the garden without a guided tour.) There’s a fair amount of walking and stairs for outdoors (we were fine, ages 23, 58 & 70) and it was the largest palace garden we saw in Seoul and Kyoto.  The guide was one of the best English speaking guides we heard over 2 weeks: she allowed ample time for photos but kept us moving along (a lot of ground to cover.)"
53,5.0,"Absolutely worth the trip!  When you are in the gardens it is hard to believe that you are in one of the largest cities in the world.  It is peaceful, serene and relaxing."
54,4.0,With all of the Hanbok traditional clothing rented out to visitors it feels a bit like a time machine ... well except for all the cell phones. One can picture yourself there hundreds of years in the past. Certainly added to the full experience.
55,5.0,"The grounds of this palace are quite extensive and walking through it on a very hot day proved to be a challenge. For us, it was one of the top things to do - but do pick a coolish day if you can!"
56,4.0,One of the attraction that will be recommended to you when you visit Seoul... A lot of walking and kind of viewing a lot of empty rooms..
57,5.0,"It is a very nice place and there are also Sakura trees that make the place look even more beautiful. However, you cannot enter the secret garden unless you are with the tour guide and you are not allowed to eat or inside the secret garden."
58,5.0,Great palace to visit. Summer in Seoul is hot mid day so it is a good idea to go as early as possible. Nice place to take photos.
59,5.0,Its a must go place. Travel guide explained every thing precisely. You can get a good idea about Korean dynasty.
60,5.0,"This palace isn’t too crowded and the best compared to others. The main attraction is secret garden. You may pay extra to entry the secret garden. You can entry secret garden only if you join the tour that are provided in this palace. You may book the tour one befoe, online thru changdeokgung’s website. Better you book the tour since there are only 100 people to be allowed join the tour every 2 hours (check the timetable on website)."
61,5.0,Well restored palace structures and a real sense of history palpable throughout the grounds of the site. Wife and daughter rented Hanboks nearby and toured the area while being photographed. Highly recommended destination for all travelers while in country.
62,4.0,A smaller Palace and a quiet one; not too crowded. The Secret Gardens of this Palace is the main attraction and are not to be missed out. The tour to the Secret Garden is a conducted by a Palace tour guide and these start on specific timings (please check at the ticket counter)
63,5.0,It's really enjoyable trip into the garden shown from ancient view in peaceful & joyful moment together with my lovely family~~. Beautiful sunshine made a tremendous view over the pond reflecting the shining particles from the surface made us feel like in the paradise~~.Be there & walk in slow while you're feeling the inner peace in this beautiful garden.
64,5.0,"Great atmosphere. Nice canteen, museum well displayed and plenty of photo opportunities with locals strolling around in traditional clothes."
65,4.0,"One of 4 palaces in Seoul and I would say in terms of scale the most magnificent one.  However, all of the buildings are either closed or empty inside.  Are the ancient Koreans sitting around in an empty room all the time?  I'm not sure, but the experience could of been greatly enhanced if the buildings actually have things in it for people to get a glimpse of life of ancient Korean royalty.Finally, the main palace within this palace the front door that you can see the emperor's throne was blocked off for ""Korean language tour only"".  So if you're a foreigner you're NOT allowed to get the best view to see inside the palace.  The only reason this is a 4 star and not a 5 star."
66,5.0,We love the beauty of all palaces. Hanbok costume brought us back in times. Beautiful set up & we had so much fun there.
67,5.0,"There is a lot here, and there is no way I'd appreciate this place if I just walked up independently.  We went on a private guided tour, and it was magnificent.  There are a lot of details that we would have missed if we did it on our own.  Totally worth the time to see this place."
68,4.0,"Nice place to visit once but not more. If you wear a Korean traditional costume “Hanbok”, the entrance is free ! Otherwise it will cost you 3000/person"
69,4.0,We went June 2018. Got the tickets for the secret garden tour the same day.  Highly recommend the secret garden tour.  It's the prettiest area. The landscaping is very pretty. Took us about 4 hours to tour the palace.  Much longer than I anticipated. Many tourists dressed in hanbok. Wear comfortable shoes because the palace is huge and lots of walking. Pack a water bottle because it's hot.
70,3.0,"small palace , not much things to see when compare to China Palace. not worth to go as need to pay entrance fees."
71,5.0,"You should try the traditional cloth and you will find next to this palace many rental cloth shop, you can rental and wear it and have lovely picture in side the palace( your inter will be free of charge if you wear the traditional cloth)"
72,4.0,Its history in the middle of the city. Nice place to walk around and its a really big place. The weather was good. Watched the changing of guards at 2pm and it was a nice thing to see.
73,5.0,Nice palace to spend the afternoon walking around. The buildings have been freshly painted and look gorgeous.
74,4.0,"We went for the 10:30am Secret Garden tour on a hot June day. We find the tour a bit slow for our pace. The garden itself was alright. However, we find that the morning/noon sun was quite draining. And there were some uphill and downhill that we need to climb. It might be difficult, if not impossible for people who have mobility problems. The garden itself and the scenery was very nice, but after touring the garden for 1.5 hours, we were not so keen to look at the palace anymore (as we have seen the bigger one the day before).  Overall, I would recommend this for those who likes to look at architecture and learn about history. But probably it won't be very interesting for young kids."
75,4.0,"This is a unesco world heritage site, a very huge area where several palaces were built bu kings of the jeoson dynasty."
76,4.0,"The place is great, full of historal lessons. The structure is simply amazing for it's unbelievable architectural design!!! Come on and visit to appreciate the place!!! Thanks for the enthusiastic effort from our tourist GUIDE!!!"
77,4.0,"Was a scorcher the afternoon we went and we really felt the heat and the crowd! Your bus after your bus come to the palace as well as domestic tourists alike. The palace is nice to walk around, would suggest waalking shoes as the paths are cobbled or sandy.It is quite impressive and still in good condition. Grounds are huge and backs onto the mountains. Very nice."
78,5.0,Very quiet place to visit as compare to other palace in the area. Good location to take any photograph
79,5.0,"We visited this palace on an organised tour.  There were no lines, everything was easy to understand.  The trees and gardens were amazing.  Well worth a visit."
80,5.0,we came solely for guard changing ceremony but later turn out other activities very intesting. room the area for 3 hours and a worthwhile visit.
81,5.0,"Rent a hanbok, dress up and spend a few hours here. Great free museum, good people watching and the changing of the guard is spectacular and happens every couple of hours. A beautiful piece of history. A small fee for the garden section, if you are over 60 show some ID and get in free."
82,5.0,"The real highlight is the secret garden. Do not miss it. So pretty and so worth the tour. In my opinion, far more worth a visit compared to Gyeongbokgung."
83,5.0,"Changdeokgung Palace is huge. English is on some signs. Rent audio headphones to move at your own pace - the map tells you which number to punch in. They are due at 5pm so return them before you go on the last Secret Garden tour or ask your guide to call ahead. The beautiful SG tour is up and down several hills. Scholar trees are all different, to represent the variety of academic fields. Some of these trees are hundreds of years old. After a while you forget that just past the wall is a modern city."
84,5.0,"I nearly thought I had to skip the secret garden as I missed the online booking, only fifty slots per time slot per language per day. You can not enter without buying the tour tickets. But I read that they have fifty tickets on sale on that day as well so we went before opening to queue and managed to get tickets. I would advise getting the integrated palace pass as it is more worthwhile for visiting all the palaces and Jongmyo. As long as you take the guided tour it wouldn’t seem like a blur of palaces. Each one had its unique features and place in history.In spring the flowers are lovely and the architecture layout here I feel is the best of the palaces. It is a lot of walking for old folks to do and a bit of uphill and downhill especially at the last leg of the Huwon tour, so wear good walking shoes. The guide does give breaks at each point though and there is a toilet inside. The cafe and souvenir shop in the palace grounds is really nice do check it out. No food served though."
85,5.0,It’s my 2nd visit to this UNESCO Heritage sure. It’s the more beautiful of the palaces I have been to in Korea. The architecture and placement of flora & fauna makes it a wonderful place to get pictures and envisioned what it was like living then by the the royals. The Huwon Tour took 1.5 hrs on top of the 1-2 hrs you need at the palace and go on weekdays when it’s less crowded to ensure you can get tickets for the tour.
86,5.0,I always love historical places with structures basically kept the same through the years. You get the feel of the way things were by walking through the grounds.
87,4.0,"Most palaces in Seoul look alike. Although lacking the grandeur of Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung boasts of being the most recent palace to actually have been used and of having a huge garden (forest, actually) right behind it.If you only have one palace to visit, I'd recommend Gyeongbokgung -- unless it's in the fall. They say the Secret Garden is the most beautiful during that time.TIP: Those who wear hanbok can enter the palace free. You can also avail of the Royal Palace Pass for 10,000 won that gives you free entrance to 5 palaces (including the Secret Garden)."
88,4.0,Very huge palace! You can get lost walking around in here but it was so beautiful with lots of history. nice place to take pics!
89,4.0,"If you're looking for some souveneirs for for your loved ones & friends,this is a place to consider.You'll find a lot of things here from cute korean items to trendy outfits."
90,5.0,Went to the palace with my girls and friends and we had fun going around the place and take photos. It was not crowded when we got there and we were able to go around the place easily.
91,5.0,"In case you have limited time and cannot decide between Gyeongbokgung palace or this one -> I'd clearly recommend this one (Changdeokgung) over the before mentioned. Reasons: 1. mostly not as crowded2. Wonderful garden (especially in autumn and spring// In summer more shade then Gyeongbokgung!3. A bit closer to the part of the city with traditional houses and many neat coffee shops.4. Closer to Insadong5. Closer to Jongmyo Shrine6. Neighbouring Changgyeong palace is worth a visit, too. In summer there are night tours through the beautifully lit up premises. You need to reserve tickets beforehand!What you should do at  Gyeongbokgung however is to watch the change of the guards. However you would not need to pay any entrance fee to do so. Enjoy your stay!"
92,5.0,"We were astounded by the size and the beauty.  So colorful and ornate.  It's hard to imagine the time and labor that went into creating something so beautiful, especially since it would have all been done by hand."
93,4.0,"During out stay in Seoul we had fine yes very cold days, on our last time we experienced a snowfall at Changdeokgung Palace.  We didnt get to see the Secret Garden but still was very worthwhile a visit.  Its a great historic site, to admire the architecture, and another thing i noted was some of the trees were named which is a nice also, as being winter most were dormant."
94,5.0,A must-see-visit. You'll feel the history by roaming its wide parks and corridors. You can even see the throne room.
95,5.0,"A visit to where Korean kings lived and worked, and get a sense of history. Entrance fee is only 3 usd, free if you are over 60. Better find out the times when they have free English tour guide before coming. Take advantage of that to enjoy the tour better."
96,4.0,"Not quite as grand or beautiful as its neighbor to the west (Gyeongbokgung), this palace nevertheless boasts its own charms and serene architecture. For example, it does offer a bit more history and authenticity as it is quite a bit older than the other palace which was only recently rebuilt. A major part of the palace are the hidden gardens which were closed when we were there. I can imagine how spectacular those would be on a beautiful day and how much they would add to the experience."
97,5.0,"Changdeokgung Palace is one of the two largest and most visited palaces in Seoul. They are similar in many ways - well-preserved, beautiful, with extensive grounds and many buildings to explore - but Changdeokgung has much larger grounds, which you can tour if you have a special ticket. When you first arrive, you can buy an entrance ticket to the palace, and at the same time can ask for an entry ticket to the ""Secret Garden."" This allows you entry at a specified time but doesn't cost anything extra. I've gone twice and once they just let us in at that time and we were free to wander at will. The second time, there was an English-speaking tour guide who showed us a few of the most important sights within the garden. It is amazing how quickly you feel immersed in nature, even though you know you are in the center of a bustling city. It is so quiet and serene - just the thing when city life gets too overwhelming. Definitely wear your walking shoes - the paths are smooth and wide, but the garden is very large and hilly so it requires a bit of stamina to see it all. Young children or anyone with limited mobility will find it tough to see the whole thing."
98,5.0,It's like walking in to a period movie seeing all the ancient structures where kings and queens used to live.  Korea has an impressive way of preserving their culture and this place really gives you a slice of how ancient Korea was.  It was just a bit too cold to explore though during winter as the weather when we were there was at -9 degrees C.
99,4.0,"This historic palace was the seat of power at one time and was built in the 1300's. The pomp and pageant including the changing of the guards to the palace entrance is still maintained.  The palace and various royal activity houses and the gardens is spread over a vast area which occupies the central Seoul.  The plants and various flora were in full bloom and looked stunning.  It was very tiring walking between various buildings and gardens but there were places to rest and eat.  To see it properly one would need to spend a full day, but we only had a half day so the visit felt very rushed."
100,5.0,"As part of our tour package we visited this place. It is a UNESCO World heritage site. I saw the main hall, the king residences,  the queen residences and members of the royal families where they have stayed. All buildings are in harmony with the environment surrounding them. Truly a historical site worth coming to visit. Thanks"
101,5.0,"More serene and beautiful, but less grand compared to Gyeong... palace.Make your way to the Secret Garden for series of pavilions. It was predictably dry due to the winter season.Must be a pretty sight in spring, autumn and summer."
102,4.0,"Changdeokgung Palace is greater than Jongmyo Royal Shryne, but even more beautiful, bigger and glamorous.It is right behind the Jongmyo, so it is worthy to go there as well."
103,5.0,"Changdeokgung palace is one of the most beautiful palace complex in Seoul. It s absolutely a must to visit the secret garden if you go there. I would recommend to book in advance the visit through their website as the visit is limited to 70 people, and there are only 3 guided tours in English per day. Recommended season would be fall."
104,5.0,"Changdeokgung is one of my highlights of my week long Seoul trip.  Absolutely fabulous!We were lucky that our hanok host helped us prebook the Secret Garden Tour.  I heard tickets are hard to get (especially during Autumn foliage season) and can get sold out as fast as within the first 10min the system is open for booking.Our guide was entertaining and shared many stories about the royalties, as well as the palace architecture.  Now I understand why some of the doors are built so low...The pace of the tour was relaxing.  There were some steps (upslope) towards the end but nothing difficult.  I don’t consider myself fit and/or athletic, but I had no problems keeping up with the group.  My two little kids managed very well too!You may want to visit the loo before the tour.  There is only one toilet break during the 90min tour.  No outside food and drinks allowed.  So perhaps a snack before the tour would be a good idea (if you are visiting near lunch time)."
105,5.0,"It was a very nice tourist place to visit. They have a secret garden tour that costs extra if you don’t buy the combination ticket. It’s a guided tour that takes about an hour ands half. It’s quite a bit of walking so make sure you’re up for it. Overall, the palace was nice and the grounds were very scenic. For me most of the palaces in Seoul are very similar to each other and that includes this one too."
106,5.0,"If you like watching Korean drama, you should come visit this place.  Very easy to go to thru the subway"
107,4.0,This was a backup residence for Korean Royal family. It's well maintained. The change of guests show is interesting. I think that's about all.
108,3.0,please do not compare the palace with Indian counterparts. The rooms are spacious but the furniture are not that elegant as found in India. Korean history is depicted and those have an inclination towards history may love it. Place is crowded with both foreign and local sight seers/tourists
109,4.0,This palace is located as well in Jongno adjacent to Gyeongbokgung - only a few minutes walk away. I love this palace because I feel like it's massive than Gyeongbokgung and is less crowded. It's possibly because there is no ceremony happening unlike the aforementioned.
110,4.0,"We arrived around 10.15 am on thursday.  It was easy to get there by subway. A little walk following the sign, we were asked if we would like to enter and join the secret garden Engligh tour, starting 10.30 am. We were excited to join.  The tour guide showed buildings in the secret garden with little tips of the palace."
111,3.0,"It is a Unesco World Heritage site. It is very similar to Gyeongbokgung Palace. You only need to go to one of the Palaces. However, the Palace is calm and peaceful."
112,5.0,This is a must-see if you’re in Seoul. We were lucky to visit during the holiday and got to see a special demonstration as well.
113,4.0,"It was good experience to visit the palace  (it was free for tourists because it was mid autumn festival) and the secret garden (fee applied with English tour guide). The palace has many entries and it was in in city which was good. The structural of the buildings were in good condition and very details, even there were lots of small allies that unable to enter but did not cut the fun to take selfies and pictures. The secret garden was so exclusive but need abit of walking up and down, after all not too bad because the tour guide was in slow pace allowing guests to walk slowly to see, look around and experience. The structural of those buildings were in good form and able to know how the King relaxed, the views of those big lotus ponds, trees, water and breezes..which was good experience."
114,5.0,"During our second Seoul vacation, we decided to go to this palace and enter the Secret Garden tour. It is so beautiful inside. It's worth the time."
115,5.0,"An UNESCO World Heritage Site, built during the Joseon Dynasty in 1405, Changdeokgung Palace is both a highlight of Seoul and a must on any history lovers itinerary. The gardens are beautiful with mature, think 300 year old, trees. The palace itself is historical and a good look at Korean architecture from that era. I love how the palace compounds blends so well with the surrounding nature. Recommended."
116,5.0,"A beautiful preserved palace. Authentic and bring you back to the past. We waited for the free English tour. Please check the website for timings. The guided tour helps in understanding more about the palace areas. Easy to manoeuvre around with children. If you want to visit the secret palace, it's better to reserve a place online first on the website. The secret garden is worth a visit and a very peaceful place. However, there are many steps at certain parts so it may be difficult to move with the elderly and kids in strollers."
117,5.0,"First of all, palaces in Seoul aren't something spectacular nor in fantastic sceneries. That's not what they pursued in the past. Gates might be the biggest structures. And maybe some temples on mountains or on cliffs will be better for wallpapers. Tourists expecting those might be disappointed after visits. Nevertheless, there are people who have been so impressed on them and Changdeokgung is one of the best.- location: Locating in a less crowded area and with less reputation than Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung is comparatively quieter and more comfortable to take a look. Gwangjang Market, Jongmyo Shrine and Changgyeonggung Palace are near and good for connected package in a single day.- The true beauty of Korea's palaces is a harmony with surrounding nature. Trees, rocks and even views around are parts of the palace. Sophisticated roofs of buildings are also nice.- The tour is walking outside and watching. The good weather is very important.- There aren't many buildings and visitors can't enter inside.- Guided tours only during weekdays. Free visit on Saturday. I think slow travelers will prefer visiting on Saturday.- Secret Garden: Called as Huwon(後苑 Backyard Garden) or Biwon(秘院 Secret Garden) in the history. 5,000 won to have a guided tour. This takes about 90 min and there are several buildings and pavilions in the forest. The old tree near the way out shouldn't be missed. Right next to the entrance of Huwon, there's the entrance of the other palace, Changgyeonggung.- The gift shop has tons of quality gifts comparing to most other folk shops in Seoul. Prices are high as they need to be.- Events like night specials will be also nice. They have illuminations and great performances."
118,5.0,"Changdeokgung and Gyeongbokgung are the two palace highlights in our opinion.  We timed our visit with the changing of the guard, which is very interestin to watch.  The place is not too big or crowded, and the written guides are helpful."
119,4.0,"This palace was a great place to see the Chinese remanence on Korean culture! This place is a symbol of Korea's historical culture, but if you look closely, you can see things that were influenced by china."
120,5.0,If you're going to select one palace - this is the one.Many different buildings in this palace area - all with slight differences to suit its purpose.Definitely do the Secret Garden tour - so much lush greenery and a very scenic/peaceful walk through the garden - I would have loved a study/library in a garden growing up!Look up the tour times before you arrive to make the most of your trip. A few cafes and coffee places across the road from the Palace once you're done with your trip.
121,5.0,"We walked very slow here to experience this world heritage Korean palace. It was built early 1400 & the whole place is still in good condition. It is grand, big & every corner and few steps are film killing spot. Every building has its own ancient days function & read the explanations are recommended. This is the place you should really come if you are in Seoul. Please walk slow & experience slowly.我們走的很慢的在這個世界遺產的韓國歷史上的宮殿，1405年建築的皇宮還維持的很好，很壯觀、很大、每個轉角和走個幾步都很值得拍照，每個建築物在古代都有特定的功能，應該要讀一下建築物的說明；真的很值得來，也應該慢慢走、細細體會。"
122,5.0,The Palace grounds are very beautiful and English Guided Tour fantastic.  Learned a lot from this visit.
123,5.0,"its nice to be back in spring time,try to rent thier national dress, as you can rent them for 5t won the entrance of the place is 3t won."
124,4.0,"One of the most wellknown heritages in South Korea. It's listed in UNESCO. The area is big. If you wanna enjoy more about this palace, you should go to the secret garden. Because, personally, I feel like the palace layout is quite similiar to other palace. This place is also safe for children. It's really hot in summer. Make sure you bring umbrella or portable fan with you. Wearing heels is ok for the palace, but I don't know about the secret garden. It cost 3000 won for adult. For young children under 7, it's free."
125,5.0,"sitting in the heart of the business district, it is hard to miss this little gem. walkable and within range of so many other things, it is a garden in the middle of the urban sprawl."
126,5.0,"You should not miss this place. It shows the style of Korean last dynasty at is splendor.Do not miss the ""Secret garden"": you need to make a reservation in advance and you can choose between English, Japanese and Korean guide:  it worth it because the guide gives a lot of information about the way life was in those gone days. I can imagine the garden would be even more beautiful in Autumn or in Spring."
127,5.0,"Magnificent palace with a beautiful, jaw dropping garden! A must visit iconic spot in Seoul. A UNESCO world heritage site. I was trully impressed by the beautiful landscape, pond, intricate designs of the palace itself. A unique experience."
128,5.0,"The Changdeokgung palace is a fascinating place to visit with the architecture and the Secret Garden. I went with a Hanbok I had rented from OneDay Hanbok, so I was able to get in for free (but you still have to pay for the secret garden tour even if you are wearing a Hanbok). There is wifi throughout most of the grounds, and there are a lot of nice places to take lots of pictures, especially if you are wearing a Hanbok. Just make sure to crop out others who aren't wearing Hanbok :)"
129,4.0,"A really beautiful palace, it was a lot bigger than i expected. Took the free English tour, which was about an hour. The English tour runs more often than published on the webpage. Highly recommended to follow the tour so that you can get a proper history of the palace as the design of the rooms are about the same. Go for the Huwon tour as well! The garden was really pretty.Took about 1 hour each, be prepared to do a lot of walking as well as stair climbing."
130,5.0,This palace is beautiful but do not skip the gardens.  The garden is beautiful and peaceful place and you can almost hear and feel the history of Joseon dynasty here.
131,5.0,"It's a very nice place if you're interested in history and Korean culture. If you only have time for one palace in Seoul, see this. The surroundings are more close by and in my opinion prettier than Gyeongbokgung, and you must see the Secret garden. Make sure to book a guide to the secret garden online the day before (you can book a ticket the same day at the palace itself but it's a bit risky during peak season). I would recommend getting an audio guide for the palace itself if you don't want to wait for an English guide."
132,4.0,"The palace is definitely worth a visit with many beautiful buildings spread across the palace grounds. I mostly enjoyed the Korean teenagers in their traditional clothing posing in front of the palace buildings with selfie sticks in hands. While at the palace, enter the people culture museum (free entrance) next to the palace."
133,4.0,WE were here during the early morning. Not too crowded. There were numerous buildings throughout the palace. We were just in time for the military ceremony. The colorful costumes of the guards were on display.
134,4.0,"Less crowded than the main palace Gyeongbokgung, it is the perfect place to take pictures with no one in the background. Went in late May. Also where you can visit the Huwon Secret Garden. Admission to the secret garden is separate from the palace. Tickets are limited so it is advisable to book online."
135,5.0,The palace is very beautifully preserved. Every detail has been taken care of. I love the secret garden tour and I would visit this place again.
136,5.0,"We went on 10:30 English tour of secret garden.  90 minutes of walking hilly areas well worth the effort.  Then after we went to palace which was self guided, less crowded and more fun on our own.Found some things not on the tour book such as sun dial."
137,3.0,We had already been to the other palace so we found this a bit repetitive and nothing new. So one can choose to ignore if short on time. Also do note that it is closed on Monday so if you do plan to visit plan accordingly
138,3.0,"I dont really understand what is the hype about? I'm sorry, although it is a beautiful place, I do prefer Gyeongbokgung.The great thing about this place is that it follows the natural contour of the land, so be prepared to do a lot of walking. The grounds are huge! but you would need to pay an extra ticket for the Secret Garden. For the elderly, it's not such a friendly place because of the natural topography.Recommend you to come here if you have nothing else to do. Also, get a guide to fully understand the history of this palace."
139,5.0,"This is the 2nd palace i would recommend going to , besides Gyeongbokgung. This palace was the working palace for most of the Joseon dynasty and contains a lot of history and stories. When walking around please notice the number of layers of the stone foundation. Only royalty or important nobles could have 3 layers , others could only have 2 or less. pleas also notice the chimneys at the back of the buildings ( and not on top of the buildings). They provided underfloor heating from the earliest times. Here is a tip , try to join a free walking tour of the palace , it only takes 2 hours and its most entertaining.  go to the visitkorea site to look for these tours. They are done  by volunteers who dont want tips or payment. so bring some chocolates as gifts. but their knowlege is immense and they tend to be retirees who do this for a pastime."
140,3.0,"Second palace after gyeobokgung,building structur same like gyeongbokgung.in the back of this palace there is secret garden(huwon gongwon).must buy tiket again 5000krw and must with tourguide.you can choose it's depend on time and language."
141,5.0,Recommend to join the guided tour of both the palace and the garden without which is just a stroll in the park without appreciating how the architecture changes with time e.g. Driveway at one of the buildings.  Was winter so was cool to make those walks.
142,5.0,"Beautiful & super big palace, you have to walk a lot but you can't miss.The Korea architecture is really good with use of bright colours onto the building.It's really good to see local people visiting palaces in colourful traditional dress !!Must visit place !!"
143,5.0,"The palace is lovely but the highlight is the secret garden.  You need to join a guided tour, which isn't something we usually do, but the tour guide was interesting and easy to understand.  We reserved our places on-line, which was easy to do and can be done up to 6 days in advance.  Tours in English are at 10.30, 11.30, 2.30 and 3.30.  You do need to allow yourself 15-20 mins to walk from the main entrance gate to the start of the tour.  If you are planning to visit the garden then you really should buy a combination ticket.  This cost W10,000 (less than £7) and includes entrance to the secret garden as well as entrance to four palaces and the royal shrine.  Given that Changdeokgung Palace and Garden costs W8,000 together, the combo ticket is excellent value.  You need to take your reservation details to the main ticket office to exchange it for a secret garden ticket before entering the palace."
144,5.0,"Part of our trip is to learn about Korean history, hence we visit this Palace and were glad we did. The Palace ground is huge but we managed to covered all. Worth visiting"
145,4.0,A nice place to know the history of Seoul or South Korea.  Much better if you have a guide so that they can explain every aspects in the palace.
146,5.0,"I appreciate Korean Palaces so much because it shows how much they treasure their history. It was well preserved and strictly kept clean, and thus it has become a highly respected place. I wish the Philippines valued its history as much as Koreans did. :("
147,4.0,"2nd visit to this palace. But 1st time going for the Secret Garden tour. Just have to do online reservation in 1 week advance for which language the tour would be conducted in. Reach the palace at least 20 mins before tour starts to secure booking.Went during Spring time, and trees look bare. Scenery would have been beautiful in Autumn. Secret Garden tour took around 1.5 hours to finish and there are up/down slopes to take on which might be tricky for elderly. It's still manageable to walk at your own pace, just that will be missing out on the introduction of the corners. Friendly tour guide are more than willing to share and answer queries which you might have for the sites. Would love to be back during Autumn!"
148,5.0,"this is probably the second famous palace tourist will visit. entrance fee is USD2.60 for adult and free for children below 6. the secret garden is only allowed with guided tour, make sure you book ur tour at least 1month in advance. cuz it normally sold out on the day itself. Otherwise, just freely rom around the garden is very relax too. suggest to visit in spring.. there are 2 big peach blossom tree which is very nice for photo taking"
149,5.0,A great experience as part of the Korean culture. It's interesting to get the guided tour in order to understand what each building was for. Also a tour of the secret garden is recommended. Very  beautiful but even more so with spring and specially in fall.
150,4.0,This palace not as big as Gyeongbokgung palace but its connected to Changgyeonggung palace. If you want to go to Secret Garden better use Hanbok (Traditional Korea T-Shirt) because its free
151,4.0,"This is one of the Unesco heritage sites one should visit when in Seoul. It is the palace where the last remaining members of the Korean monarchy lived until the 1980s. So you will be able to see how they lived here during the 1900s to 1980s and witness the traces of modern contraptions during that era. Although the infrastructure of most of the buildings within the palace are not original as the original palace was destroyed during a fire, the new structures (still pretty old since it was rebuild in the 1700s to 1800s) are magnificent. I absolutely love the colours and design of the rooftops of the buildings within this palace. There is also the secret garden which is really beautiful and perfect for Instagram and offers you an insight of the life of the Korean monarchy. recommended to join the free tours that is provided (subjected to different timings for Korean, Chinese, Japanese and English). Separate secret garden tours are charged at extra fees. If you intend to visit more than 3 royal palaces in Seoul, would recommend to get the Royal Palace Pass to enjoy more discount on the entrance fees to all of the palaces in Seoul."
152,5.0,"Nice palace to visit , it's huge, many pavilions, tickets are3000 won each not all pavilions are openYou can't actually enter the actual pavilionI was excited to see some furniture pieces and rooms but nothing really ( unless we totally missed) only the main pavilion you can see the huge throne where the king used to sitNice place to visit but enough once"
153,5.0,We went there to explore the unesco heritage and we were pleased to be able to understand better the Korean history and culture. The palace is really nice and well maintained and you can visit it with a free guided tour booked on seoul information centre website If you have time for only one palace maybe not this one thought
154,3.0,There are other attractions inside this palace but you have to pay for them e.g. the secret garden. Maybe this is more beautiful during spring bloom or summer. Not so interesting during winter.Bring a stroller if you have young children.
155,4.0,"We enjoyed our 2 hour visit on a sunny morning in late-March. The first cherry trees were in blossom beside some of  the palace buildings, and everyone was taking photos beside them. There were lots of visitors but the place is so big you can easily get away from the crowds. We enjoyed seeing locals in Korean dress, it helped us imagine what the palace looked like when in use. After lunch we walked around Bukchon village and had a great day."
156,4.0,"The palace was nice and was interesting.  Not sure if they do it everyday, but while we were there, a lot of people dressed in historic local attire, both male and female, were there and it was very neat.  Very friendly people and willing to take pictures with the tourists without having to pay.  When they close, they close and they have several people rounding up slow moving people pushing them toward the door..so don't plan to get there late and overstay."
157,3.0,For tourist who likes touristy and history - the place to go.Walked the palace and discovered many interesting facts too. Worth going!
158,3.0,The palace is located around the city and easy to go to there and rich the area.The palace is also wonderful
159,5.0,"This palace is across the street from the Great King SeJong. It's a long walk so take some walking shoes. There is a National Palace Museum of Korea inside on the left. We found some pretty cool souvenirs you can't find anywhere else in Seoul! You can peek over the wall, and there is the Blue House. If you book in advance, you can visit the Blue House too. We got cancelled because of the demonstration happening during our visit."
160,5.0,"1) One of the most beautiful places in Seoul. Great palace of thousand doors and windows and a Secret garden.2) Open (spring) 9:00–18:00. Closed on mondays. Best time — weekdays evening (16:00–18:00).3) Admission fee is 3000 won for palace and 5000 won for garden (require palace ticket).4) Access to the Garden is allowed only with guided tours. The last English tour starts at 15:30.5) Good cafe (no food, only drinks) and a shop."
161,5.0,"This place has a nice park. And the beautiful  buildings. The weather was cold enough, but The Sun was shine."
162,5.0,"This palace complex is a good example how Korea preservs its history. Very well conserved. Those palace are a historic mark of the glorious period of Joseon Dynasty in Korea, from 1392 to 1910. Its offer two english tours in the morning and two or three in the afternoon depends on the period of the year. For foreigners is mandatory to take the English tour."
163,5.0,"While Kyeoungbok-gung is a workibg quarters for the King, this place is the actual living quarters for the royal family.  Much restoration has been done to correct Japanese mischief during the occupation.  It's a cosy and pretty place, a palace"
164,4.0,"Really impressive from an architectural viewpoint, with a number of different palaces for the King, the Queen and Concubines. The Secret Garden is a joy (extra charge though) and should be at its best in the Spring. Great place to escape the turmoil of modern-day Seoul."
165,4.0,"Really like this palace. I bought a combination ticket but it was not enough for me, I went 3 times! Go early in the morning 9am on a weekday and you practically get the whole palace to yourself. Walk around and immerse in its beauty & serenity. Definitely join a guided tour to know more about the grounds. Check their website for timings for various language guided tours. We went for the 10:30am English tour. Very nice. It ends just in time at 11:20am for you to catch the 11:30am secret garden guided tour. The secret garden is only available on guided tour, with extra ticket, so check online for secret garden reservations or go early to book a spot at the ticket counter. It's worth a visit so don't miss out. Although many buildings are new, as the originals were burnt down during the Japanese war, it's still an interesting place to visit. Recommended!"
166,5.0,"very beautiful palace, however, you have to purchase separate ticket if you want to visit backyard garden. i personally think the garden is not so special during winter. they do provide free tour guide in chinese, korean and english. very good service. if you have time, rent traditional korean costume from shops outside the palace will make this trip more memorable. and if i'm not wrong, you can enter this palace for free if you are wearing Korean Hanbok."
167,3.0,"Interesting, but quite a walk not recommended for elderlies. Might be great on summer as flower are bloomed."
168,5.0,"We visited Changdeokgung Palace in November and the fall foliage was beautiful, especially in the secret garden area. Make sure that you get the ticket that admits you to this area, which is at the back of the palace grounds. A must-visit site when touring Seoul!"
169,5.0,Visited the palace because of the secret garden which requires a booking. The secret garden is big and spectacular. How I wish to be the emperor back in the times to enjoy the palace
170,5.0,Smaller and quieter than the other palaces.  We were travelling on our own and had booked tickets for the secret garden tour online.  This was truly one of the highlights of our trip.  You don't have to be very fit to join the 1 hour walking tour but they do expect you to stay in the group and not wander off during the tour.
171,5.0,Nice and quiet palace for great photo. Joined the secret garden tour. Good stamina is essential as there are many slopes and kinda steep. The garden is very beautiful though some works is going on at certain places. Lovely maple and ginkgo tree in the compound. Great experience to figure out how was the old times royal family life. Impressive!
172,5.0,"It is better to buy the Combination ticket that costs W10,000 and gives admission to 5 sites and Secret Garden. During peak seasons, it is advisable to book for guided tours via their online portal. The schedule for the guided tours are listed online for easier planning. You can also walk around the plalace ground except the Secret Garden. The guided tour of Secret Garden is highly recommended. Our tour guide was excellent in presenting the history and features of the Secret Garden."
173,5.0,"In this palace, there haveany trees and surrounding was awesome. I believe if during Spring or Autumn, you could see beautiful colors of flowers and red leaves surrounding this palace. A secret garden a must visit spot besides having a massive long walk to this garden of silent. A little pond and resting place will be good for a snapshot or wefie or selfie is memorable. Apart from this wonderful place, there's a little cafe that you can drop by to check out beautiful souvenirs. You can have a cuppa too! Trust me, this is really a nice palace that I love to visit again next time. Thanks to our private tour guide from Top Korea Tour, Juno who explained the historical part of this palace and we were like adventurers exploring the place in and out. Found a little secret locked place~you can find out yourself when you are there.My mom was cooling resting at the cafe enjoying the view of trees. Totally different feeling from other palaces. For those who appreciate history or architecture designs, you would love what you see. For others, just visit this place to get to know more."
174,4.0,"It surrounds with high level of wall, and locates at the heart of the city, really fusion with modern buildings around. Be alert that, it close on Monday. It is calm, scenic and comes in solid culture ambience."
175,3.0,"We visited in October 2016. It was a special day that day when admission was free for the palaces.  So we went to all 3 that day.  We discovered this at the first one we visited.  It was a cool day and overcast.  We figured it was good the admission was free because unlike other castles and palaces, all three of the palaces in Seoul are just empty buildings.  We enjoyed the walk around the lake and the forested areas."
176,4.0,"love the architecture of this palace. however there is no guard changing ceremony here. overall is a good place to visit when you are in seoul. To go here, the a subway to Anguk Station (Line 3) Exit #3."
177,4.0,This palace is neat to look around...not much on display but the area is nice with some fantastic scenery. Whilst there we learned that it is in the process if being rebuilt and so not much of it at all is actually historic.
178,4.0,The size of the Palace is average but the buildings are quite well maintained . The secret garden though  not much to be seen but can see that it was once quite a beautiful one.
179,4.0,"Our second palace to visit and a must since it is one of UNESCO's World Heritage sites in Korea.  Visiting it, we understood why.  The buildings are so colorful and well-preserved.  We even got to enjoy tea inside one of the rooms near the royal kitchen which had been converted to a cafe.We did a DIY tour which was not difficult as signages abound and there was sufficient information for all the structures.  We also visited the Biwon (Secret) Garden afterwards.  The guided tour was very informative."
180,4.0,"This property was a good tour. They have several English speaking guides and tours throughout the day.  The guide was knowledgeable and I recommend you take this tour as the guide had a few free tips that were of interest. The tour finished in 50 minute and finished just outside the entrance to the secret garden. We didn't have enough time to fit in the secret garden on this trip, but not because of the tour length as it ended near the secret garden about 10 minutes prior to that for starting."
181,4.0,Visit this place on a cold windy day. Great scenary with historical houses but most of them is the same.
182,5.0,"The palace grounds were expansive and the trees and leaves on the grounds were coloured beautifully in shades of red,yellows and orange in Early december. We have signed up for the secret garden tour which proved was great as the guide was very informative on the history and description of the area. The gardens were also equally beautiful with the historical buildings and a backdrop of autumnal flora and fauna. This would definitely be on my must visit list for Seoul.I would advise visitors to look up secret garden tour timings in their language prior to their visit as you can only enter the secret garden as part of a guided tour group. The grounds and garden are filled with plenty of steep steps and slopes - would advise those with walking difficulty to give this a pass as it would be hard to move around. There is only a small shop beside the gift shop offereing coffee and light refreshments - visitors would definitely have to head elsewhere for food."
183,5.0,"When a went to soul I know I can find to many places to visit, but this temple is a nice place to go"
184,5.0,Situated within the busy Seoul city. Lovely sight with the maple leaves turning yellow/red. Recommended the best time to visit would be in autumn and don't forget to spend a little more on the tickets to visit the Secret Garden. It would be more meaningful to go with the guides (since you paid for it) as he/she will do some explanation of the different points and the history of buildings.
185,5.0,"You should visit this palace in autumn especially its secret garden. The view was magnificent. You have to walk a lot, though hence proper shoes is recommended."
186,4.0,"We bought tickets for this palace along with tickets for the secret garden tour.  Unfortunately, the tour guide for the secret garden had somewhat stilted English (and was thus a bit difficult to understand) and the tour was quite boring, so we just ventured out on our own after a while.The palace is humongous so be prepared for a very long walk.  Also note there really isn't much food you can purchase within the palace itself except for some drinks, so be prepared for that as well.The palace does get a bit repetitive at times, although the nicely manicured grounds do make up for it."
187,5.0,There is a secret garden in this palace. This palace is less crowded than gyeong bok gong. Visitors should plan the trip ahead with perfect timing for guided tour.Entrance fee to palace:3000won (free for those with hanbok)Entrance fee to secret garden:5000wonDefinitely worth a visit!!
188,5.0,"Palaces are a must-visit attractions when we are in Seoul, Korea!We are allowed to snap photos in the palaces. Some of the palaces does charge nominal fees but most of them are FOC."
189,4.0,If your going to tour one of the palaces make it this one. Its the biggest and most scenic I would say. Make sure to time it properly so you can watch one or two of the guard changing ceremonies. Spend some time walking around and then relax a little by the absolutely stunning pond in the compound. Great way to spend a couple hours.
190,5.0,"This palace is so so beautiful in the spring with cherry blossoms and in the autumn. You can visit this palace with the Huwon garden (3,000KRW for entrance fee and 5,000KRW for the garden admission fee)."
191,4.0,"Beautiful palace, cheap price and fantastic location. Go go Insadong and Bokchon village after and then have lunch or dinner!"
192,4.0,Great location to gain insights into the history of Korea. Need a good guide to introduce the area and bring history to life.
193,4.0,"The palace ground is huge, but retained the old Josheon dynasty feel. A site where they shot some of the scenes for the famous Jewel In the Palace Korean drama. Worth visiting - I reckon it is better than Geongbokgung Palace."
194,5.0,"I visited Secret Garden which is located in the back side of this palace. It is called ""Bi-won"" in Korean, and which means ""Secret Garden"" because this place was allowed to special persons only in Chosun Dynasty.English speaking guides are available. There are several time section and Koreans can't join English section without foreigners company. Secret Garden is available only visitors who reserve it in advance."
195,4.0,"If visiting the Secret Garden, it is quieter and less crowded than Gyeongbukgong because you must book a tour to enter.  In my opinion, this is a top site to visit in Seoul.  The garden is small but pretty and tranquil.  It does not compare at all in terms of splendor or grandeur to the imperial gardens of China, but does have its own unique flavor.  It is clean and well-preserved.  If you can, plan to spend a bit of time relaxing there.  There are a number of small pavilions set up with books there to chill.  A very nice touch.  wear your hanbok for free admission."
196,5.0,This palace is really beautiful and peaceful. It is possible to see many Korean visitors with their traditional Korean dresses and that is absolutely lovely. It is a must see in Seoul.
197,4.0,"I really enjoyed the fact that this palace was within the city and near a train station. It was a relaxing walk in the palace - although most of the relics are reconstructed, it still gives a good idea of how life was in the past! My family and I decided to take the Secret Garden tour. It is really beautiful and great for photo taking."
198,3.0,"I loved the architecture, the layout of the land and of course the history of the Palace. It just seemed a bit dusty and it is very inaccessible by wheelchair or stroller even though there are ramps."
199,3.0,"We went to Seoul in June, it was quite hot, I had high expectations about Seoul but so far it was just an average trip that didn't have much attraction. We went to Changdeokgung Palace. I like places with history and story attached to it. I enjoyed the food but didn't love it. I guess enjoying/loving your travel will depend on the places that you go. So maybe next time I will try the outskirts of Seoul."
200,5.0,make sure you do the secret garden walk!we had a wonderful time!a bit hilly but we managed a buggy fine
201,4.0,"Easily access by subway ( Angguk station, exit 3). Entrance fee was 3k won and secret garden was 5k won. Closed on Monday. You can see many locals and tourist wore hanbok. Worth to come."
202,5.0,"This palace is open at night for certain period of the year.  It used to be at the center of heavy and noisy traffic with a zoo.  Now it is relatively quieter neighborhood.  Without a zoo.  One amazing development is all the walkways are accessible to wheelchairs.  It opens at 7 at night.  As it is less popular than another palace in downtown, it is less hubbub. You can enjoy a great walk feeling the spring air.  No street vendors.  Only some security guards as guiders.  It was always there, you can find.  I hope more spaces would be open and it would be connected to Secret Garden and Royal Family Garden.  It would be then two-hour walk.  As of now, it was about 30 minutes walk."
203,4.0,A nice place which you should go visit one for taking pictures. Also interesting to see the guards changing shift
204,5.0,Beautiful palace and so many stories to unfold. Rated the most beautiful palace out of the 5 grand palace.
205,5.0,"Very beautiful palace with a secret garden(separate ticket needed, giuded tour only with freindly giudes who speak English fluently). A good souvenir shop with refreshments and rest rooms."
206,4.0,We attended the 10.30am free English guided tour and it was very informative.  We then went to the 11.30 Secret Garden tour - good but we abandonded half way through to make another engagement - beautiful gardens.
207,4.0,"We saw the changing of the guard which was a lovely sight,we also got to dress up in national costume and have our photos taken with the guards."
208,5.0,"Which is smaller than gyeongbok palace but it's beautiful palace! Inside the complex, you can find Huwon, UNESCO site! That is really beautiful and you can find the finest scenery of old korean building and nature together! they are harmonized! Plus, you can hear awesome explanation from special tour guide! She was friendly and knowlegable about Korean history! For tips  to visit here, elderly is not good here, need to walk at least 2hours for changdeok palce and Huwon"
209,4.0,"This was an insightful outing.  Nice to visit and learn of anther culture, time, place etc.  A good walk in the fresh air as well."
210,4.0,"My first time to visit Korea's palace and it was amazing. We took a lot of pictures at the entrance as there was some men who wearing the tradition Korean customs.   It was a pity that we didn't spend much time at the palace and wish to try the Korean customs.  We also didn't have time to visit the secret garden. For me, I will visit this palace next time."
211,4.0,"You need to arrive fairly early if you want to do the secret garden tour after the palace tour. English-speaking guides take the tour around the palace at 10.30am and the secret garden tour kicks off at 11.30am. We turned up a bit late so although we had the palace tour, the garden tour was sold out and we had to wait until 1.30pm for that. Luckily our hotel was very near so we nipped back there as there isn't really another two hours of activity once you have toured the palace. The talk was very good at giving an insight into court life, meaning when we later went to Gyeongbokgung Palace we didn't feel it necessary to join a guided tour. Word of warning to the infirm, the garden tour has some quite steep climbs and quite a lot of older and more overweight vistors found the pace a bit intense, especially in the heat. It's also worth buying the four-palace pass if you intend to visit all the palaces in Seoul. We only did these two, but I'd recommend them both. Gyeongbokgung is much bigger and also contains two fantastic museums. A real must visit."
212,5.0,"I enjoyed visiting this gorgeous palace. It has so much architecture and history! The day we went was free entrance and we only had to pay for the English-guided garden tour which lasted an hour. When visiting you can see some Koreans dressed in traditional clothes. It can be very humid and hot so stay hydrated! Also, you can take beautiful pictures so I recommend bringing your best camera. Highly recommended if you are in the area!!!"
213,4.0,"Changdeokgung Palace is set within a large park in Jongno-gu in Seoul. It is one of the “Five Grand Palaces” built by the kings during the Joseon Dynasty. And as such, it was the principal palace for many of the Joseon kings and a 600-year-old UNESCO World Heritage Site.We were here for a visit as part of our full day city tour. We arrived at around 9.30am and stayed there for slightly over an hour. It was not crowded when we arrived (perhaps it was still early) and our admission fees had been included in our package tour. But I understand that the admission fee is 3,000 won per adult.The palace ground was massive, with many ""interlinked"" palace buildings from one to another with a big open compound. Of course what was interesting was the ancient style of architectural design and to some extent, similar to the Chinese style. According to our guide, both ancient China and Korea were good allies and thus the country had some influences from the Chinese culture. (in fact, on the roof top of some buildings were designs of the Chinese classic novel, Journey to the West, with the Monkey God, the  Tripitaka Master etc, cool!)Maintenance and conservation work of the buildings had been done here by the city authorities. So we walked from one building to another, with some being able to enter or taking a look from outside on the interior structure of the palaces, such as the King's chair and office, paintings etc!Along the way, we also saw some people wearing the traditional Korean Hanbok costumes, very nice, colourful and lovely~ And you are keen, you can try them out too!As we need to visit several attractions in our tour, we were not able to stay to visit the Secret Gardens which according to our guide, was very beautiful and nice!For us, the visit here was generally fine and interesting to learn about the ancient culture of Korea though we would love to see more like in Gyeongbukgung Palace. Weather was very sunny and warm and do remember to bring along an umbrella, hat and drinking water.Well, if you are planning to visit some palaces in your trip here, Changdeokgung Palace is also a good option besides the Gyeongbukgung, though the latter has much more to see, besides the buildings and gardens, bigger, there is also an ancient ""change of guard"" ceremony.But do take note that the former is closed on Mondays and the latter is closed on Tuesdays!"
214,3.0,"It is good maintained, large, can let you feel  the background of The country. I like Vietnam palace more so that I rate 3 points for it."
215,4.0,"Designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997, it is closed to Buckon Hanok Village, we can walk from metro station of Anguk exit No.3 around 7-10min, very easy to found, you can spend 3-4 hours on Changdeokgung and Buckon Hanok Village together. Nearby it also have Gyeongbokgung, No. 1 palace in Korea."
216,3.0,Overall i find the Palace in Korea a bit too boring.Is all a shell other than that nothing much to see and everything thing looks the same. Is a shame when you look into the room is either empty or pretty dull. You want to see the richness of it during those days.I reacon they cold do much better. Only highlight i got was the delicious cold Citroen Tea you can buy at the giftshop.That was a really nice drink freshly made lemon tea with pieces of preserved lemons. Loved it.
217,4.0,"I went there with my old parents just yesterday. Another thing to add in your must-see list. Personally, I find Gyeongbokgung more beautiful but the Secret Garden tour in this palace is something you should not miss."
218,4.0,"Best advice: Tour around with a tour guide. Tour guide is free you just have to wait for their schedules. They offer Chinese, English, Japanese and Korean languages. You can check also their website which is very helpful! Tour guides are very passionate they will make you love Korea!! <3"
219,5.0,"with my family, even though it was so hot day during Aug, but from time to time, can feel windy and it was not that huge like Gyeongbokgung, and building and history was fascinating enough to attract our attention! Something not good is only there was not enough parking space around this palace"
220,5.0,"Changdeokgung has a secret garden which makes it worth the visit. We booked tickets online the day before, which might be neccessary as it might sell out during high season. I would advise to try and go early or later i the afternoon as it was a bit too hot to go mid-day in mid-August. The palace itself and the surrounding buildings are similar to the other palaces in Seoul, however a walk around the secret garden was very nice and made it stand out from the others. If I remember correctly we were told that the lotus flowers bloom in early September so I guess this would be the best time to go, in order to enjoy the full beauty of the Secret Garden."
221,4.0,We enjoyed the Secret Garden tour.  Inexpensive tour with a guide.  This was the only highlight we liked.
222,5.0,The price was a bit too high for a family of four but we did look around and visited the museum next door which was free.
223,3.0,If you into the history you will like it. But if you not don't bother to come. It is building only .
224,1.0,Went there with my wife and son especially to see secret garden. Gosh!!! What a waste of time. Nothing to see in that garden. Mughal gardens in india are much better. Took free English tour. Felt walking in a normal garden. But totally disappointed. Guide used to show a simple hut with no great architecture and give its history. I got to know that I am doomed when they told that the 1st place we will visit iin the garden is the most beautiful place. A big no from my side.
225,4.0,"This is a smaller than Gyeongbokgung but more easily and prettier. The garden gives it a touch of relaxation and contact with nature. If I had to choose from the two, I would definitely go to this one."
226,5.0,Beautilful place to visit and take a lot of nice pictures. Try to book the secret garden tour. Dont forget to wear a comfortable pair of shoes.
227,4.0,"The palace is an expansive retreat from the hustle and bustle of surrounding Seoul.  In a few steps, you are transported back in time, especially if you or the people you are with are dressed in Hanbuk wear.  Bring water and an umbrella on a hot day.  Make sure you do the secret garden tour and at the end of the tour, don't take the stairs-- take the long way back-- good way to get photo ops along the way without the crowds!BTW, you get in free if dressed in Hanbuk!"
228,3.0,"Visitors were not allowed to enter the main building to view the internal structure. I was impressed in the very beginning, but it became boring after walking around as the exterior design of all structures looked the same. The place was well maintained and cleaned but you need to pay for entry fees."
229,3.0,"While we learned a bit about the Joseon Dynasty and the end of it, this is a tour of old - they are empty and closed off.  Since we didn't book a tour of the secret garden, we just walked the grounds.  Not a lot of relief from the heat."
230,5.0,This is a great palace in an interesting area after your visit. Beautiful gardens and a great tour for English speakers. A must visit in Seoul.
231,3.0,If you r in love with the historical place. This is the right choice for you. This palce was recognized as a world cultural heritage site by UNESCO too.
232,5.0,"I love this place as this is the heart of the korea empire culture from ages. There are lots to see and sometime if you are lucky enough, you will see some special performance. The palace include a lot of painting and there is also a library inside the palace. The presentient working office is just right behind the Palace. Many people there when this is a nice weather. Be sure to check out TravoAsia.com first, they also have apps. as they are specialize in Korea attraction ticket and may provide you with surprise discount. I have bought some attraction ticket from them and it was good. For transportation, you can reach the palace by subway, although you have take about 10 min walk from there. have a good day."
233,4.0,I have been to this palace on first day of my visit to seoul. The history of seoul is interesting and the palace is replicating it. Classic buildings are hallmarks of Korean culture. Yo can enjoy it if you have interest in history and culture
234,5.0,The palace guides have some personality...actually was fun to learn a little history about S. Korea..
235,5.0,"This is my favorite palace in Seoul. I have lived here for a couple of years and have seen all of the palaces multiple time with all the guests who come visit. I have been here twice and it is beautiful.I recommend doing both tours if you have time. I was reluctant to do the palace tour (on my 9th palace visit) but really enjoyed it. The guide focuses on telling you what happened in each building and how they were used as well as fun little stories about the people who lived there. It was a tour unique to this place and moved at a good speed.The garden tour really depends on the guide. My first time he was fantastic and gave funny stories about each place and the second he let us wander alone a bit more. No matter what you must do the tour to see the garden, which is really the whole point of this place. Strongly recommend - if you only see 1 palace other than Gyeongbukgung this should be it."
236,5.0,This one of the must do in terms of Korean tourist sites. It had vast and big grounds and a lot of palace buildings yet had an eerie tranquil feeling about it. The buildings seemed to be constantly destroyed and rebuilt - which is a bit like the psychic of the Korean history - forever under attack. It is an interesting way to learn the history of Korea and how hard it must have been. The grounds were really big so it was an impressive show - well spent the afternoon meandering around. A lot of the Koreans were also walking around taking photos in their traditional outfits as one gets free entrance wearing the traditional Hancock.
237,4.0,Enjoyed the free tour of the palace and then the secret garden. The tour guides were excellent. The secret garden wall was very worthwhile despite the hot summer heat. A good few hours - could have spent longer.
238,5.0,My daughter and I visited Changdeokgung Palace during our trip to Seoul. What a beautiful example of Korean History and Architecture. If it wasn't for all the tourists it would be a great place to sit and meditate. Really enjoyed the detail on the roofs and eaves. Take your time and enjoy.
239,5.0,Ample space for anyone to snap photo and walkthrough for a historical attraction. FOC and do not have to worry about crowds as the place is really huge!
240,4.0,"The only reason I give it 4 stars, is that like many places in Korea they don't give information or notice about how much walking is required or the terrain. I took my parents here and they loved the rich history, the large spaces, but the walking, especially on a hot day in Seoul can be a lot. Make sure to go into the Palace and see the bench where the King would sit. It still smells musty and the old yellow curtains hang low. The best spot is the Secret Garden, but note this is a long walk with many steep hills and climbing."
241,5.0,"Very historically interesting, as well as beautiful! Lovely gardens, designed to complement the natural landscape.  Good restaurants nearby."
242,3.0,"It was a cloudy day when we visited this palace of the last king of Korea. Luckily we managed to join an english tour @2.30pm to find out more about the history of this palace.We didn't join the secret garden tour @3.30pm as it was kinda drizzling and we don't have any umbrella with us today.The secret garden was where the king spent most of his time together with his most beloved concubine ( whom he couldn't make as his first wife as he wasn't allowed to choose his own wife)He built a house for her next to the garden ( something unheard apparently , showed how much he loved her)"
243,3.0,Very similar to the Forbidden City in Beijing... This place is smaller than Forbidden City but the architecture are as elaborate as compared...Good to experience once...
244,3.0,"A small palace where you can spend one or two hours. They also have changing guard with two shows a day, check their new schedule first, otherwise you will miss it..At the entrance, look for some young ladies who are wearing a yellow t-shirts.  They are students from the local school and they volunteer to be tour guide.  This service is free and they are a bunch of friendly and helpful people. Perhaps this is part of their history, so most of them are very knowledgeable with all part of the palace and can walk through each part with you.  They are very proficient with English and some times can be humor too.  After the tour, it is optional to complete a survey for them and they will bring back to their school.This palace is comparatively small with the Grand Palace, but each section has its own functionality.  The secret garden is very beautiful.We are lucky to enter for free because that week was their Golden Week, otherwise, you have to pay Won3000 per person, but the cost is worth for it."
245,4.0,"I believe you do not need to visit Changdeokgung Palace and Gyeongbokgung Palace.  They are pretty much the same, though the tour we took at Gyeongbokgung Palace was better.  The best part of Changdeokgung Palace was The Secret Garden.  You can take the tour of The Palace, and then take the tour of The Secret Garden.  The Palace tours in English are at 10:30AM & 2:30pm, the Garden is at 11:30, 1:30 & 3:30"
246,5.0,"It was nice and the free english tour is a must have to learn more about the culture and how they use those houses before.If you stay at a hanok guesthouse like we did, you can walk to this palace.  The secret garden also was nice to visit.  Its longer then visiting the palace."
247,5.0,There is a lot of walking but it's worth it. No food allowed so eat before you come. Water only. This is my favorite of the 5 Seoul palaces. The garden tour was a beautiful hike. Please make sure your camera is fully charged and you wear bug spray and sunscreen! You might want to take a lot of garden pictures.
248,4.0,There is a free guide service inside the palace. A signboard shows the timings. The guide provided us with lot of interesting facts about the palace. It was one hour of guidance.
249,4.0,"I prefer Changdeokgung Palace over Gyeongbokgung Palace. This palace is lovely, I enjoyed the Secret Garden Tour (Paid for) with my family. The english speaking tour guide was excellent, speaking in clear English and giving great details of the history of the palace. Overall, an enjoyable trip here."
250,4.0,This was the only palace I visited in Seoul and I was glad I visited this palace. It was worth it. The palace is not as big as the palaces in Beijing but it is still as beautiful. We met Korean actor Lee Dong Wok who was shooting a korean drama on our way here. He was very friendly and handsome 😉. Overall..make sure you visit this palace and then take a short break at one if the cafes nearby.
251,4.0,"I dived this area in 3 party one is the palace 2nd is old city behind it and lake area, total you need 3 to 4 hours to see, They have guard changing ceremony in each 4 hours so make sure you can see that, its really leave a historical impact on your memories. walking distance from city hall and 30 min walk from main shopping area."
252,4.0,The palace is interesting but the garden is the real reason for the visit.   The English tour was well delivered by a woman that had excellent knowledge and great command of the English language.  We timed it well during the spring foliage season.  I would imagine that it may be less dramatic during a dry season.
253,5.0,"We had visited the Geongbokgung Palace the last visit and thought we needed to view the Secret Garden and naturally visit Changdeokgung Palace. The palace is rather small and the highlight would the garden.For this you have to go on the website and make a booking. We chose to go on Christmas Day thinking it would be quiet but our group was large, at least 30 (sure reminds of my school trips!). Give yourself half an hour to visit the actual palace itself. I loved the garden as it was huge, sitting in an area much bigger than the palace. It was a hunting ground for the king in the olden days so as to give you an idea how large it was. It is an oasis of calm in the midst of Seoul! However, you can only visit with a guide and therefore cannot enjoy it as much as it should be. I love to sit and watch the world go by so that is not possible. Lovely and well worth a visit."
254,4.0,The palaces were so beautiful but practically enjoyed Changdeokgung because of the spring flowers and Cherry blossoms outside. I can't recommend the Secret Garden tour for those who are not fit or elderly though as it is really a struggle. We went there early April so the trees are still bare and there were only few spring flowers here and there. Still it was a nice experience.
255,5.0,"A very lovely palace indeed. If you are going to visit, must see the Secret Garden, which can only be accessed thru a group tour. These are in limited # so you must sign up in advance! Just sign up online at the official palace website. It was very easy! This palace is full of history and no wonder they sealed off a portion of the palace grounds to general public to preserve its history and architecture."
256,4.0,"Changdeokgung is the most unique Korean palace built in harmony with landscape. No doubt this is one of the kings of Joseon favorite palace because of the spacious and beautiful Secret Garden. This palace closed on Monday.Most stop:Injeongjeon Hall - the throne hall Seonjeongjeon Hall - the only structure remaining at Changdeokgung with blue glazed roof tilesHuijeongdang - the King's ResidenceDaejojeon - the Queen's ResidenceNakseonjae Complex - built for King Heonjong's beloved concubine The Secret Garden - it takes up almost 60% of the entire area of the palace. (additional admission charges if you want to visit this Garden), advice to visit this garden during autumn for more colorful view. Only guided tour are available in the secret garden."
257,4.0,"We did this as part of a tour, and the place is wonderful. The history and culture of the place is impressive and with a knowledgeable guide is a great way to learn about this wonderful countries history. Great day out."
258,4.0,"This is an interesting place, although not as impressive as those in other Asian countries. It is somewhat maze like, with several building scattered over a wide area. I strongly recommend setting aside at least 3 hours to visit the whole complex."
259,5.0,Great palace great history I loved going round this palace with its pinks blossoms and it's decorative work  and sculptures dragons and monkeys took me well back in time
260,4.0,We were out walking around and happened to catch the changing of the guard. It is a really interesting site to see and hear.  The grounds are also beautiful with the cherry blossom trees in bloom.
261,4.0,"The entrance ticket can be bought online. It is a bit crowded to come here during cherry blossoms season. It is better to visit the Secret Garden during the autumn, not spring T.T"
262,3.0,i went there just in time when the guards were marching with their national outfits. it was cool! the place was easily accessed when you travel by train or with the hop on and off bus.
263,3.0,"We decided to visit this palace instead of Gyeongbokgung mainly so we could visit the Secret Garden. The palace itself is not that large. It was peaceful walking through the complex as there were not a lot of tourists. However you couldnt enter into any of the buildings and only on occasion, get a peek into the rooms. If you like architecture then this is for you."
264,4.0,"The Palace and its grounds were sprawling.  To think South Korea is not huge. So many nook and crannies to explore. Interesting short and different shaped doors; sections of the palace and quarters for their staff. How many people used to live there? - uhhhmm.  It is quite a walk, so be prepared to wear comfortable shoes and recommend doing this in the morning when it is less warm/hot.  It's a shame they cordoned off going inside the rooms for a better look up-close, but I guess the government has its reason for doing so.  Famous sites including their theme park Everland via train/subway is doable; make sure you ask for directions on what train to take and inform them of your destination and ask if the place is open on that particular day.  Plan your trips so you can maximize to see the sites once you are in a certain area in South Korea specially if you are there for a short stay like us - 5 days 4 nights.."
265,4.0,This was an interesting palace but we didn't spend very much time here because we were so short of time.  I would like to be able to visit it again.
266,5.0,"Though not as huge as gyeongbok palace, Changdeokgung has a more romantic feel to me. I actually prefer this palace.Unfortunately, we missed the free English guide to this palace, so our information was limited to those written on the boards located outside the buildings.But since I'm a fan of periodic dramas, I was able to roughly put together a nice story for my family ... though there were complains about my version :)We were too late for the Secret Garden, but we did not mind it since it is still winter, so most of the trees are still bare.I definitely recommend a visit here .... it's not Seoul if you did not visit the palaces."
267,5.0,"Quiet surprise this palace still kept in good shape, a nice place for photos shooting. The changing guard show really interesting."
268,4.0,"Love this place. I saw the changing guards and have a chance to take pictures with them. I paid about $5 to get inside. The place has some young men and women dressed in Korea outfit to walk around and stopped for pictures. They are love birds and felt that I was back to the pass and was walking in the palace hundreds of years ago. Not crowded at all, and it was pleasant to walk around. The trees was so nice and the short explore was a much do in Korea."

271,5.0,"We only visited one palace during our trip to Korea. The area is huge and we spent lots of time just taking in all the grandeur. It's easy to reach the place by public transportation. Since we booked at a nearby place, it was a pleasant three minute walk to this palace. Our 7 year old had a grand time running around and pretending to be palace guard."

279,4.0,i visted Changdeokgung Palace in summer and visit the secret garden.  Feel in touch with Korean culture.  they have various language guides to give the knowledge when you visited the secret garden.
280,3.0,Be prepared for lots of uphill and down hill walking here. Lovely scenes for different seasons. Has a huge garden inside which is the main attraction.
281,5.0,A wonderful place with amazing buildings. The garden was gorgeous and the intricate work on the roof of each building was so lovely. A great tour guide who explained the history so well.
282,5.0,"Make sure you do the guided tour and wear Google shoes as there is lots of walking, the gardens are beautiful"
283,4.0,"We wanted to visit because it’s a UNESCO World Heritage Site, but what we really enjoyed was the Huwon or Secret Garden. General admission ticket to Changdeokgung lets you wander around the main buildings of the Palace. To see the Huwon/Secret Garden, you have to join the compulsory tour with a separate ticket (ticket combines general admission and tour).The “garden” is really the natural surroundings and wooded area that covers more than half of the Changdeokgung complex. The tour lasts 90 minutes so wear comfortable walking shoes. Also, check for Huwon tour times and what language you want (Korean, English, Chinese, Japanese) and time your visit accordingly to avoid disappointment.The Huwon/Secret Garden is beautiful in how it was built to blend harmoniously with its natural surroundings. Buildings, pavilions, ponds and gardens are designed around the geography of the land and landscaping is minimal, a stark contrast to the typical palace complex which adopts a grid-like plan. As beautiful as the gardens are, it’s also rich in history. Your guide will also furnish you with the history of each structure and its purpose, be it library, study, contemplation or banquet. Overall, Changdeokgung was a more serene palace complex; we wandered around the main buildings and encountered less tourists than elsewhere. And maybe it’s because we like history and nature, but the Huwon/Secret Garden tour made this place a must-see during our visit to Seoul."
284,4.0,"Secret garden is in this palace, you need a guide to access the garden. but the palace itself you don't need a guide. you can just enjoy the time yourself. It is in a walking distance with bukchon hanok village... so you can combine another attraction with this place."
285,5.0,The place is amazing. It will need lot of walking but it worth it.I enjoyed each angle and details of the place.
286,5.0,You must come here! Another favorite! Lots of nooks and crannies to photograph and get photographed in! Shows the true beauty of Korean culture
287,4.0,"The day we visited the palace, it was snowing, Turned the Secret Garden into a fairy tale garden. Beautiful, convenient for wheel chairs and baby strollers. Guides (English) gave good explanations and time to take photos. Book guided tour to Secret Garden online to avoid delay and disappointment."
288,5.0,"Smaller and more compact than the Gyeongbukgong Palace, but with access (for a small additional charge) to the this palace gardens."
289,4.0,"nicely kept palace. enjoyed taking a leisurely stroll through the palace grounds.  although not big, it provides a relatively easy walk for both young and elderly alike."
290,5.0,"If you have the time, do both the Changdeokgung Palace and Gyeongbokgung Palace. The Changdeokgung Palace showcases palace grounds in harmony with nature, while the Gyeongbokgung showcases the grandeur and of the palace structures and its symmetrical order.  Going on the tour of the Piwon Secret Gardens was a highlight, touring through the beautiful landscape around the hilly grounds.  It is highly advised to book the 90-minute tour in advance, as each tour only accommodates 50 and is usually sold out, at least for the English and Korean language versions."
291,4.0,"This is a good place to visit specially for people who has interests in local history and culture.  I was amazed by how they manage to restore and maintain the facade, color and architectural integrity."
292,3.0,A good morning and some history to mix with everything else but not overwhelmed.  Easy to get to though and close to Insadong
293,4.0,Charming palace for a quick visit.  Worth walking through the contemporary art museum on the grounds.
294,5.0,"I visited Changdeokgung Palace in Dec. and was amazed by the secret garden. Although leaves on the trees are all fallen, the buildings are stills pretty amazing. Tourists are only allowed to go into the garden at certain time with the guided tour. The tour guide was very helpful and really explained the idea behind each building and their layout. Tour is around 1.5hrs and basically hiking up and down the hill, because the garden was built on a small hill.The guide also recommended us to come back in the autumn. The palace will be much more colorful than it is in the winter."
