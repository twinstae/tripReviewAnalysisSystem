1,5.0,"Price is definitely much cheaper than restaurant in city. Good selection of meat, Sirloin is the most well liked and it cost about 30k won for a man’s palm size slice. Easy to get there. Exit 2 of Majang station, once you exit, u will be Able to see signage to guide you to the market. It’s very clean for a wet market. Vendor can discount a 10% .. so u can try ask for discount."
2,5.0,"For same meat quality, I saw the prices in Myeongdong to be almost double than the prices at Majang Market. Of course the restaurants' price are already all in, while in Majang, the meats are brought to a restaurant that has a cooking charge per person, prices differ if you use charcoal (6,000 won), or stove top (5,000 won). Charcoal is slightly more expensive and this is what we chose. Prior to going in 1 of the upper floor restaurants, I specifically asked for charcoal, because I read that some restaurants are only table top.We got several meats: beef at 1+, and 1++. The difference was only 1,000 won per 100g, and though the 1+ was very good, the 1++ was noticeably better. We also got a pork moksal with  a 1++ rating and this was quite tender, and very good.After selecting the meats, I asked the store owner nicely if they have any discount (we ordered a lot, since we were 6 the initial total reached 146,000 won), and he willingly obliged to round it off to 140,000 won.Going there, we followed the route as provided by the blog of jovenatheart dot com:  take line 2 to wangsimni station and get out of exit 8.  At ground level, turn around 180 degrees and find bus stop ID 04-134.  I forgot which bus we took either bus number 2222 or 2015 (one of them was available at the bus stop, the other is not). 3 stops away, get off at majang meat market, bus stop id 04-119.  You will get out right at the west market entrance.   After our meal, we decided to walk off the meal, and we walked to Yongdu Station, around 500-800 meters away."

Prices are about 10% lower than supermarkets in Seoul but shopping environment is certainly not as clean. Like most meat markets, there is a stench in the air. Bought some famed Hanwoo from a friendly store and made our way for BBQ lunch in a restaurant upstairs (BBQ restaurant charges apply). Meat was indeed very good, with good balance of marbling giving good meat flavours. Overall a nice dining experience for the family but I’d prefer to spend a little more to have better ambience."

Korean beef is absolutely phenomenal.There are like chargrilled on the out side, but still really soft and juicy on the middle,Mabling is stunning. If you visit Majang place, DON'T miss 팔팔황금한우, 고기랑식당.The owner are so nice and they treat you how to cook."
