There is a nice and free museum under the two statues that tells you about these two great Korean men.

A true David and Goliath story.

The Gyeongbokgoong Palace, Statue of Sejong, Gwanghwamun Square and etc. You should visit all of these together since it's near by and walking distance. The area is huge so you can take some cool photos. However, there are often strikes and protests which can interfere with the view or cool photo opportunities. It is one of the popular landmarks of Korean history so visit if you're in the area."
16,3.0,Currently there is a tent city set up around this statue so getting a clear photo of it is a real challenge. The tents are scrappy and covered in plastic and not a good look. Some political group I guess and a shrine to the people lost in the ferry tragedy. Go underground to the museum to find out about this generals life.

20,5.0,"Just before the Main Statue of the King stands admiral Yi Sun-Sin. You can spot him form far away and he stands rather proudly in the middle of a walking island. Right now the tents to remember the victims of Sewol and before you step before the admiral you are sadly reminded of the horrible accident. Around the admiral are water works where on hot days, like in July, children happily play and somehow lift the whole mood. The statue itself exudes authority and commands attention. In comparison to the kings statue, which is kind, warm and fatherly, Yi Sun-Sin shows a fierce gaze and a stance as if he is off to war."
