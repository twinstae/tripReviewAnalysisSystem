0,4.0,"We took a quick stroll with the kids before sunset, when it gets cold.The lanterns were not lit up but it was a refreshing quick stroll. I bet it's even lovelier during summer.One of the more relaxing area in this busy city."
1,4.0,We visited in the evening of Christmas Day.  There is a lot of people as expected.  The stream is being decorated with beautiful lights. People are taking photos along the way and above at street level.  Unfortunately some rude Korean speaking ladies ruined the evening as they kept pushing and squeezing towards the railings for their photos while our girls were taking theirs. Could have been a five-star experience.
2,3.0,"Second time visiting, but first time with my teen so wanted to show her, it was interesting to walk in this stream but we went there at about 6pm and it was pret dark and there was no activity nor christmas nor year end lighting so we didnt stay long and left."
3,5.0,"It was a nice stroll after food at Kwangjang market, walk all the way to dongdaemun. The kids enjoyed the stroll."
4,5.0,"It was having christmas theme, so the stream is decorated accordingly. A good stroll to take after having lunch."
5,3.0,Just another stream to me. Maybe i did not spend enough time there. Ok to have a look but nothing to wow about in my opinion.
6,5.0,"Was brought by relatives to visit this beautiful place. Caught by great surprise with the amazing landscape along the stream. We happened to chance upon 2019 Seoul Lantern Festival in Nov. There were so many featured lanterns, each lantern has a story behind it which are very interesting for visitors to enjoy reading them while walking along the river. Took us about 20 to 30 mins as we were enjoying & strolling slowly with a toddler. And there’s also water laser show around 9pm which drawn a lot of tourists and local visitors too. During one part of the stream, you can opt to place a floating lantern with light costing krw 5000, saw many young couples and families doing this for fun as well as for goodwill blessings.I think this place is very romantic too as we can take many lovely pics in the evening with all lighted lanterns as backdrop. What’s more fun is you can step on the rocks in the river to cross over the other side. This is something really quite interesting. We walked from Jongno-5-ga all the way Euljiro-1-ga station back to our hotel. Definitely recommended for those first timers and returned visitors. Will be back again next time I visit Seoul again. Thumbs up!!"
7,4.0,Such an interesting stream and atmosphere running through the city. Although the stream is in the heart of the city it is such a pleasant place to rest. You will see business people and tourist alike relaxing and enjoying the sounds and sights of nature...taking a break from their day. Love the green umbrella installation and also the spot where you throw the coins in. my kids loves running up and down and crossing over the water on the large rocks.
8,5.0,"This stream in the middle of the city is just wonderful. With walking paths on both sides, and stepping stones to cross the water, it is perfect for a walk or run. We are staying at a hotel nearby, so we have taken several walks here, both during the day and in the evening. Highly recommended!"
9,5.0,"Great idea in the middle of a big city. A shallow stream where you can sit, soak your feet and socialize with friends and family."
10,4.0,Good place to take a rest after walking around the city. You can see some fishes and creative graffiti.Also there are so many bugs and mosquitoes.
11,5.0,"Such a relaxing walk in the midde of the city, very peaceful with fish and storks, can walk from  Gwanghwamun square to at least Dongdaemun."
12,5.0,"Cheonggyecheon stream is an excellent experience. We dip our feet there and it was very relaxing. The water flow was pretty hard, so no one dared to cross the stream, even though it wasn't deep and was not a long way to cross. We threw some coin inside the well. My daughter successfully threw one inside. We stayed there for 30 minutes. It was the best foot therapy ever."
13,3.0,"A quaint and quiet walkway in city center, especially near Eulgi-ro and Dongdaemun. My husband, daughter and I were relieved to stroll along this tiny stream after a hectic meal in the Gwangjang Market, where we ate the famous Bindaetuk and Kalguksu. Actually we bought some Yut, or korean taffy, at the market and ate them while walking. There was a street concert going on, but kind of 60s style."
14,5.0,Love the atmosphere. There are plenty of things to see. Would like to go back again if I have chance
15,5.0,"The most beautiful spot in Seoul. Took the metro from Myeongdong to Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station, exited at Exit #1; walked past the futuristic Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) designed by Zaha Hadid; and crossed the street to the stream entrance. Immediately we were entranced by the greenery and quiet. There were only a few tourists, walkers, and locals starting their day. It was a refreshing contrast to the hustle and bustle of Myeongdong and all the other touristy areas we visited (e.g., N Seoul Tower). Total distance back to Namdaemun-ro and Myeongdong was less than 2.5 miles; under an hour."
16,5.0,"Man made, below street level stream. After a long, hot day of walking, it was nice to dip our feet in the cold stream to cool off. It could be better maintained in terms of trash and weed removal. It was cool to see a heron stalk and pluck a small fish out of the water and eat it whole."
17,4.0,Our family visited this stream and enjoyed the photo moments. We enjoyed our stroll along the stream. It was a short and easy stroll for us. A worthy experience for my family.

18,5.0,"We came here on an evening and the scenery was quite beautiful. The wind was blowing it was a bit cold, but nevertheless we had a pleasant time relaxing at the stream enjoying the murals and the flow of water across the stream. The kids enjoyed this stream so much as well. Truly recommend this spot to those who loves peace and tranquility."
19,4.0,"Nice view for photo and nice place to visit. Good to learn about the historical and community environment. In the past, this area was a railway. But in the present, this is a nice park in the central of Seoul."
20,5.0,"We got lost while looking for this place but every step we took was worth it. The place was quiet and beautiful. It was serene and you can just sit there and relax. The place was a little smelly though, I think it was from the water. But the place was clean and I see a lot of people just taking the scenery in. If you are in Korea, you must visit this place."
21,5.0,"When to the section near Centermark Hotel. Although the weather was very chilly, and the path a bit slippery, it was greater and relaxing just hearing the flow of water. Different Scenery in different sections of the stream."
22,5.0,We walked from Gyeongbukgung palace and found ourselves resting by the stream. It was a soothing experience. We admired the fountain and had a look around the stalls set up near the shell statue called The Spring.
23,2.0,Located in the center but not really clean stream. There is a bad smell from the water of this stream.Not worthy to visit
24,5.0,We were probably there at the wrong time.  But we still enjoyed the walk and the environment.  We actually walked almost the entire length of the stream.  It was very cold (end of March) and the water was icy but the pathway and rock paths were lovely.
25,5.0,"Fantastic water feature right in the center of the city.  Made accessible and interesting, and thoroughly relaxing the busiest part of the city.  Walk for 10 minutes or an hour, you will love the experience."

33,5.0,"I really love how the city have transformed a once eye-sore into a beautiful and clean place for both locals and foreigners. Our visit on this place was made even special because of the Lantern Festival. Though we are a day late for the festival we are still greeted with meaningful and wonderful works of art. The displays showcased the things that make Korea - Korea, from the old day to the modern day. I love how peaceful the place is despite the busyness that's surrounding it. The place is landscaped beautifully. It's also a walking distance to Gyeongbukgong, Gwanghwamun Square, to King Sejong and Admiral Shin's monument."

43,5.0,My son and I did enjoy our walk. It was great to be able to relax in this little sanctuary far away from the noise and the traffic.  It's worth the walk.
44,3.0,"The stream is a very pleasant alternative to walking along the normal path.The stream had been covered over but was discovered and brought back to its present condition- search the history.I walked along it a couple of times, the second had a heron in the middle. The plants are kept and replanted so it is very pretty too.Can be a bit noisy if events going on above, but generally a lovely bit of calm in the middle of the city."
45,5.0,"We started at the Cheonggye Plaza end to admire the fountains. When at the plaza facing the stream, there is a ramp to your right that leads down to stream-level. It was nice and cool in the evening, and there were a lot of people just relaxing on the steps, some with their feet in the stream. There were musicians playing, and it seemed that every tunnel or wall had its own theme. Would love to go the entire length of this stream someday."
46,5.0,"The famous Cheonggyecheon stream which pass through the Seoul city centre is beautifully cool, clear and clean. It really helps in the hot summer season. We can sit on the rock and relaxing our feet in the stream while watching some fishes swim around out feet."

51,4.0,"A lovely way to get through the city, walking by the stream. There are little rocks that you can use to cross the stream and you can take shelter from the sun under the bridges, just like the locals. At the end is a waterfall with a wishing well. Along the wall is a mural depicting South Korea's history."

55,4.0,"We were staying at a nearby hotel and just outside was Cheonggyecheon Stream beside the Dongdaemun Shopping Center. My wife had reminded me that this is a favourite place for so many Korean soap opera shoots. The stream is really long, but we only descended to the strwam beside the Ogansugyo Bridge and then walked along side the stream just past the Beodeuldari Bridge. The great thing about this place is that there are many people walking and talking photos or just sitting and talking and relaxing.One side of the stream had lush vegetation while the other side was more of a wall and wide lane. There are large stepping stones every so often so that you can cross the stream safely, we saw an elderly couple manage it without problem, and the stream is actually full of fish, some quite large, which was really great for the kids to see.There are both steps and ramps (for wheelchairs) up to the street level so that anyone can walk beside the stream."
56,5.0,"This stream is honestly so peaceful and relaxing, that i would go back every time I had the opportunity to. The water is full of fishes, the side with chirping birds (and pigeons). We even saw an egret hunting for fish."
57,4.0,Cheonggyecheon Stream is in the middle of big city - Seoul. In summer it look like a small forest. It’s really good to walk there in the morning or evening. But you should be careful because there are lots of tine tiny mosquitoes. And you should be ready to make photo because you can see Asian bird. It’s nice place for walking.
58,4.0,"The stream is a quiet respite from the busy streets above, popular with local couples and those desiring a peaceful moment. The stream is accented with lights and stepping stones, and we found it to be clean and pleasant."
59,4.0,the stream is a great place to rest after a whole day of walking went there around 5 pm rested before heading to dinner... you can see a lot of locals there as well and the place is clean. the stream is long so if you plan to visit better check with tourist information... we almost went to seoul station just to see the stream while we were in insadong but it crosses insadong as well so after asking tourist info we were directed to the stream
60,5.0,"Ever since I watched the Korean drama, this place has always been flagged out as one of the filming site. I am intrigued to see a place right in the city, with stream and rock, you just feel that that is the perfect getaway after a long day of hard work. See it in the daytime and night time, the feel is different."
61,5.0,Understand that this is the original river which flows through the city. It was slabbed over by the previous city inhabitants and was uncovered in modern times. This is an open river which is set below the road level and can be accessed at various staircases along its length. The water is clean and locals seem to like to sit along the river and enjoy its beauty. There are also some buskers when we were there. Worth visiting.
62,4.0,"We weren't sure which area exactly to walk by the stream. We were at DDP and decided to check out the Cheonggyecheon Stream. We walked down and crossed over the stone tiles. My kids were particularly happy and crossed over it many times. I was expecting more people to be hanging out by the stream, so I wasn't sure whether we were at the right spot or if there are better areas of the stream to explore. Overall, it was a nice leisurely relaxing walk by the stream and we enjoyed."
63,4.0,"I went there on an afternoon before the spring lantern festival started. It is very peaceful, you can take off your shoes and go down to the water, or just stroll, sit down, and relax. And take good photos. There were a bazaar happened as well, but the bazaar started at 6, and I think it was only temporary. Depending on when you visit, check out if festival or bazaar are happening, it'll be worth to visit."
64,5.0,"Go for a night time walk, do a few kilometres and look at the light show, fountains, art displays and people. Lovely place for a stroll, safe like all of Korea, great innovative art installations which change constantly."
65,3.0,"The stream is supposed to be very lovely with loads of greenery and flowers in spring. But the weather was rather freaky when I was there in early April and even the locals I chatted with said it was too cold at -1 and 0 on some days. The stream was a good way to get back to Myeongdong with the help of google maps. However l, there wasn’t much to See when I was there."
66,5.0,"As can be seen in some K-dramas, this stream is famous for couples to sit around with some food and drinks in hand.If you are lucky, there will be lots of street food van selling along the road sides. I’m not sure the frequency of the food stalls open and I guess it might be on Fridays and Saturdays night only."
67,5.0,"despite going at night and not being able to see the fish, my 3YO still loved it - especially crossing the stream using the stepping stones. loved the stony paths, trees and pockets of flowers along the stream which made me feel like walking in the country side. wonderful place for picnics."
68,3.0,We have reached the place by chanceAnd enjoyed itIt is a river like place were u can enjoy the momentThe only disadvantage is that you can not get down with a stroller you have to carry it along with your toddler/ baby
69,5.0,"So relaxing walk along the stream. Enjoy the scene of Clear water, bird flying, fish swimming in the stream."
70,4.0,We started our walk from gwanghwamun.... It was a very nice stroll and relaxing. In between the walk you can choose to exit to street level attractions or night market or bars..... Really a nice walk and place to be after a heavy Korean dinner
71,5.0,Great place to stroll and jog in the morning. You will see many older couples or groups walking along this stream. It becomes quite dark once the evening sets in. This reclaimed stream is long with many access points to the surface streets via stairs and cuts across a few neighborhoods. Certain areas of the streams sometimes have stages set up for concerts/performances. A lantern festival is held here every year towards mid-November.
72,5.0,"Even  though there aren't many attractions nearby, only fast food restaurants and the street with the statues of the most important people in Korean history (king Yi Do and general Yi Sun Shin), I highly recommend you to go see it. I was there at noon and I wasn't disappointed even though it wasn't night time when the lights are turned on and it's probably even more breathtaking. I will surely come back here if I'll be back in Seoul. P.s: it's a common place for dates in SK so I think it says a lot about this place greatness and popularity ;)"
73,4.0,"The stream forms the centerpiece of the urban park, with pathways and plants all along the stream. The stream stretches from Gwanghwamun all the way to Yongdap area. We passed by the stream few times throughout our trip. There was one evening where we took a stroll along the stream from the starting point, Gwanghwamun. That cold winter walk was peaceful. We felt safe to walk along the stream even though not many people were there at that time. We walked all the way to Gwangjang Market to have some local snacks before continuing our walk to Dongdaemun Shopping area.It was impressive to see how the Koreans managed to rehabilitated the stream. A stream that was once being buried under the Koreans very own process of Industrialisation. It was the success of that same Industrialisation that help the stream resurfaced to see the light of day. Koreans Industrialisation success brought them to have better standard of living, thus rehabilitating more nature to be part of its urban landscape.Recommend to visit to enjoy a great urban green space."
74,4.0,I have visited this place with my family in new year and it was amazing...all decorated with lights it's better to visited at night ...u can get great pictures. It's a nice walk that gets you to other neighberhood always crowded and alive where you can also get great street food and local goods.
75,5.0,"I stayed at Venue G Hotel. my hotel located just next to it. In the morning, i always enjoy the view of cheonggyecheon stream. The water is very clear and clean."
76,3.0,"We found the place just average. There are some benches next to the stream and pretty much that's it.We went at night and the streets were well lit with nice Christmas decorations. If short of time, just skip this place."
77,5.0,"This stream is a must visit place when you are in Seoul. It has a great view, not only at night but also at daytime. You can see the rainbow light under the bridge and the waterfall."
78,4.0,"We stay around myeongdong and we walk up to the stream.  It is just around  15 mins walks. During the day , it will be more peaceful to take some pictures while night time you can enjoy the light up of the lantern and decoration."
79,4.0,"We went on Christmas Eve and it was so crowded! Despite the stream was beautifully lighted up, the crowd was too much to handle and hence we cut short our walk at the stream. If you wished to take some pictures without strangers in it, perhaps should come in the morning or not on a festive eve or day. Nonetheless, it was a fun walk tho short."
80,3.0,"We went to visit the place since it was listed under the top 10 places to visit in Seoul. Honestly speaking there was nothing much to see...it was almost winter season so it was very cold to walk along the stream. The walking path was nicely decorated, not many people were there when we visited the place. However, if you are looking for a romantic place to spend time with your loved ones then this place would fit nicely for you....quiet & peaceful walk in the autumn cum winter season. Get ready to cover yourself up ^_^"
81,3.0,"This stream existed a long time ago but had a highway built over during the country's rapid industrialization period after the Korean War.  However, it was reopened in 2005 as part of the city's urban renewal.  There are walkways on both sides of the stream but I'd advise you it any other time than winter because the walls on both sides act like a wind tunnel, so it was really really cold after just being inside for 10mins."
82,4.0,"A great improvement from the overpass that was here when I was last in Seoul! Well lit at night, was a bit too cold for an evening walk though."
83,3.0,"It just like usual stream.. but you can walk along the stream and see some statue and lantern.. It depends on what special event that was held there.. when i was there, there was lantern festival.."
84,4.0,"My family were here both day and night time in November since we were praying at KTO prayer room. Clean stream with Koi fishes... my father loved it a lot since he pet fishes back at home.There was Korean Lantern festival at night time during our trip so it was beautiful. Koreans were promoting Pyeongchang Olympics 2018 heavily here. There was also wishing lanterns at the price of KRW 1,000.The stream is strategically locates as it is situated in the middle between Dongdaemun, Myeongdong and King Sejong Statue place so you can either walk around or hop on the city bus."
85,5.0,Go here during the afternoon/sunset. Nice place to just sit down and hang out on a cold windy autumn day.
86,5.0,"A vibrant 15m tall Claes Oldenburg sculpture in the shape of an upside down spiralling pointy mollusk shell marks the entrance to the stream.  When you walk down into the stream at the elegantly designed entrance plaza, the urban noise is overcome by sounds of water, the stagnant air becomes refreshed with a breeze rustling the trees and the tall grass along this manmade stream.  The further you walk down the stream towards Dongdaemun, you begin to see the fish getting bigger in the water.  A crane is perched on one leg like in a 15th c. painting at the National Museum.  Every 100 meters or so, you can cross the stream from one side to the other via a series of bridge follies.  It is playful down here.The best part of the stream experience is that you can take the steps up and have a culinary experience at the world famous  Gwangjang Market that is on every Youtubers visit to Seoul or go see Zaha Hadid's architectural marvel at Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP)."
87,4.0,"From Sicheong(City Hall) to Dongdaemun, there's a good trail along Cheonggyecheon Stream. Nothing much to do. Just walking and relaxing. Getting into the water is banned.- Fishes, herons and some other birds.- During Lantern Festival in November, there are nice illuminations, too."
88,4.0,"This is a man-made stream within the city that also serves as a diversion of rain water during wet season. After a day's walk or work, it is quite relaxing to just sit down and enjoy the flow of the water."
89,5.0,"This place is near from Gyeongbokgung. So If you go to GBG, spare your times to go here. Just take a walk at the path side of the river, see people dating, children playing around, and ahjussi & ahjumma soaked their feet. The water is so clear, you can see fishes there."
90,4.0,"We visited when there was an art exhibition taking place, very interesting! Just be careful if you are not steady on your feet there are lots of uneven paving areas, but it was a great little bit of countryside!"

94,5.0,"The Cheonggyecheon Stream is a very clean stream that is 11 miles long, it is famous and really known because a long time ago it was VERY polluted and it was SO dirty so they were about to close it but they tried t fix it and now it is SO clear and very clean but it is cold. And it is ok if you want to take of your shoes and put your feet in the water or you can just put your hands in the water. Very nice place"
95,5.0,Although we only walked a short distance across 2 blocks it was actually great and lovely journey. There are some similarity between Cheonggyecheon stream and regent canal in London and both are very relax and great experience.
96,4.0,"Go in the late afternoon to see the difference between night and day. At night, there are lights. The stream is clean and you can even see fishes swimming and birds standing in the stream trying to catch the fishes. Around this area, there are many restaurants. It is a happening place."

98,5.0,Cheonggyecheon Stream is part of a contemporary recreational area in central Seoul. This is one of the best evidence of the modern urban renewal of the South Korean capital. Walking along the shores of this city creek is a relaxing and worthwhile visit.
99,4.0,"From the ancient times, there was an inner stream that crossed the city center of Seoul. The area that was covered with garbage dirt in the surrounding environment was rebuilt from the Han River which was reapplied several years ago. It was restored from the city hall to Ganghwamun It is said that the temperature in the city of Seoul has fallen by 2-3 degrees due to the construction of the new city. In addition, the meeting with the young people has led to the fall of the plaza. As a result, It is now time to say that the ecosystem is alive with the fishes over the years, but it is unfortunate that the natural water is not flowing but the water is drawn up by the artificial pump.,예로부터 서울도심을 가로지르는 내천이있었다 주위환경으로 쓰레기오물로 더러워진 천을 복개공사로 덮여있던곳을 수년전에 다시 복개한곳을 재탄생 한강으로부터 인공펌플르이용하여 시청과광화문사이에서 마장동까지 재단장을 하여 새로탄생한 시내천이다 이공사로하여 서울시내온도가 2-3도 내려갔다고한다 또한 젊은이에 만남에광장 휴식터로 탈바쿰되였다 매년치루는 점등식도 개최하며 서울도심에 명소로도 한번가볼만한곳으로 추천한다 이제는 세월이지나 물고기들도 생태계가 살아나고있다한다 다만 자연물이흐르는게아니라 인공펌프로 물을 끌어올리는것이안타까움이있다"
100,3.0,"My family (2 adults and 2 kids -6/7) went for a walk in a Sunday afternoon hoping to see some activities for kids but was a little disappointed by how little to do.  The only things we did were soaking feet int the water and walking alongside the river/jumping across on the stepping stones... it was superbly designed with ecological considerations and great for city residents to walk around after dinner perhaps, but not for parents looking for a place to spend the kids' energy.  If I were a biologist maybe I would have a blast educating my kids on all the diverse plants/animals you see alongside the river... I am considering visiting back during the lantern festival however after seeing other reviews - that might be a unique cultural experience."
101,5.0,"Hard to believe this stream used to be polluted and bad environment. Look at this place today, it becomes a nice place that people can walk around. Thumbs up for the people who did this. They must have put big effort."
102,4.0,The stream runs through the middle of the CBD and is a cool place to find refuge on hot days. The locals like it at lunch time. There is a tiled mural that runs a long way along the stream about the history of Korea which is interesting but there is really not much else.

105,4.0,Cheonggyecheon Stream is adorned with wall art with the nature like greens along the stream filled with rocks and small waterfalls that lights up in the night. One will not know the surrounding city and buildings until you look up. Quite an experience. Definitely take a stroll.
106,4.0,walked along the Cheonggyecheon stream. Relaxing and calming. Many people and children sit along the streams. Something different instead of walking along the pavement.
107,4.0,"came accross this area by accident looks like its in bussiness area has a more western feel with wonderful pastry shops and cafes etc ,threw in a coin...has nice feel"

110,4.0,"This river in the heart of Seoul affords a pleasant stroll for singles, couples, and families. One suggested itinerary is to start in Insadong and walk south on Samil-daero past Tapgol Park (on the left as you walk south) to the river. At the river, turn westward (to the right), and follow its course towards the deeper heart of the city. You will get a nice perspective of natural beauty blended in with modern cityscape. Follow the river all the way to Sejong-daero at which point you can come up and either turn right towards the Gwanghwamun area or left towards the City Hall area. Feel free to sit on the river's edge and dangle your feet in the flowing stream, hop across it on the large rocks, sit in the shade under a bridge, appreciate the flora, eat a picnic, and snap some lovely photos."
111,3.0,Worth a visit just to see where Hello Monster and Lie to me was shot (and other dramas). You can sit down but nothing much to do but just walk and take pic.
112,3.0,It is a large palace - lots of building. Enjoyed the walk around the palace grounds - best to follow the guide starting at building 1 and not the crowd. Very little display in the buildings except at the main hall.Interesting floor heating system in all the buildings.
113,4.0,"This place is like an oasis in the city. After you walked all over the places like Changdokkung palace, Kanghwamun square, this place is good to take a seat , take off your shoes and put your feet in the water! The light breeze chased away the heat and we listened to music from the buskers...before we headed out to explore more places in Seoul.."
114,4.0,"You will appreciate the pretty stream that runs through the city more if you understand the history. If you were living in Seoul before 2005, you would not have been able to see the stream because it was covered over with concrete and asphalt since the late 1960's. Many people and businesses had to be displaced when the stream was opened up. There was much opposition when the massive project was started by the government. Now, it is hard to imagine that this pretty space and the water that flows haven't seen daylight for close to 50 years."
115,3.0,Just a nice little river in the middle of the city but nothing to do. It's a pleasant place to go for a walk but will only take about 10 minutes!!
116,5.0,Peace and calm in the center of town.  Waterfalls and Herons wading..truly an oasis of calm.  If you need ot walk thr
117,5.0,Really did not think initially this place is a car park that was changed into an artificial river that divides in the middle of the office and shopping area so as to provide an entertainment
118,5.0,"This was lovely! Our hotel was very near and loved walk by the stream as we walked to the subway. Many people hanging out and one day we even stopped to put or feet in after a long hike in Bukhansan National Park. On Saturday there is a really fun market with lots of yummy food truck. I'm not sure if this is worth a visit if you are staying really far away, but if you are anywhere near it is great."
119,5.0,"This stream is such an oasis of peace in the middle of a busy city. It has been designed well to allow a walk along both sides with rapids, fountains and waterfall.  Night or day it is a beautiful place to enjoy a break."
120,4.0,Anice place to sit and rest.Water very clean and quiet placeA lot of tourist goes there to take pictures
121,4.0,"We continue our journey from Gwanghwamun Park with Hanbok outfit.go straight ahead,and then you'll find traffic light,cross the street and ho ahead 100m and turn left.you must take along this street until you find the river in the middle.it called Cheonggyecheon Stream.at night it is awesome with lamps and the atmosphere is excotic one.you can take a pict over there,watch out dont make your outfit is wet..so i take a picts above the stream (from the bridge)There's a place to sit and watch the stream.you can enjoy with coffee,take a pict of the scenes,chat with someone,etc.if you're hungry uou can buy meal at 7Eleveen..not far from the stream."
122,5.0,"My kids love Cheonggyecheon.  The couple of times we have stayed in the Dongdaemun area they have looked forward to feeding the carp found in the stream and watching the cranes that feed there.  It is a wonderful respite from the hustle and bustle of Seoul.  It is also a great spot for people watching.  Near the Dongdaemun main intersection, there is a runway and stage where the city holds cultural events such as concerts or fashion shows.  The sunsets can be stunning and make up for great pics."
123,5.0,Best way to end your day in Seoul is to take a leisurely walk along the stream. Water is very clear and the sound of it running through the big rocks is very relaxing. Will try to walk to whole stretch next time we visit.
124,2.0,Nice river to walk along but that's about it. A place to talk rather than a place to enjoy the river.
125,3.0,Banish your thoughts and hopes for a romantic evening stroll hand in hand with your loved ones! We were there in early June and we were bombarded with swarms of pesky little flies as we walked along the river. We had to take quick snaps and move on to the next photo location. The evening sunset in the background really made the walk romantic however the flies were really a let down. So put on your mossie repellant and make the visit snappy!
126,4.0,It's a nice water stream with flower arrangements on both sides . Honestly I expected a bit more activity and fun around the steam but it was relatively quiet. One can take a nice long stroll along the stream which is nice and calm .
127,4.0,"This was the main stream /river which ran through old Seoul or Hanyang as it was called. it s a lovely park to relax in if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city.  Progress came along and the stream was overlaid with a major road and a highway on top of the road as well. Due to one former President's foresight the highway and road was taken away amidst much political wrangling and the stream restored. Its is a nice and pleasant walk if you have a few hours to spare . walk from Gwanghwamun square , the start point to Dongdaemum Design plaza. when you pass an ancient bridge be aware of its poignant history. Its made of blocks of hard and large granite. These pieces came the second wife's cemetery of King Taejo. When king Taejo died , the normal succession was the first wife's sons to take over . but it was overruled and the second wife's son became king. But he died young and so the first wife son took over. His first act was to banish all Royal tombs from being in the city and thus had his stepmother's remains moved out and her tomb used for a commoner's bridge. It was to humiliate the stepmother and to quench some of his bitterness. The stream is beautifully decorated during major festivals like Buddha's birthday in May. there is also a night market which runs on Friday and saturday during the summer months by the stream ( nearer the start point- from Unjeonguk ro to Samil Daero)  There s a lot of upmarket street food and gift stalls to entertain you."
128,4.0,"We enjoyed a wonderful stroll along the stream during the morning. Was amazed this stream use to be covered by roads. They uncovered it several years ago. Nice to see the fish and birds in the middle of a bustling city. Many local artists have painted murals along the ways. One of the things we noticed throughout South Korea, they add little extras every where, just to bring beauty into their lives. This definitely brings beauty in."
129,5.0,this stream begin near gyeongbokgung palace and i think the best view of this long stream was here at the beginning of the stream. there's a fortune coin holes where people throw their coin to the hole to make wish and luck.when i came here there's a festival going on at the street alongside the stream. many food and merchandise were sold. a good place to take photos and relaxing your feet after strolling around the big palaces
130,4.0,"We enjoyed taking a stroll by the stream, it was a beautiful day but not many people out. What a lovely idea to add this where a street used to be. We saw a lot of fish and many birds, flowers were blooming and it was a nice place to relax in the middle of city life."
131,4.0,"There was really nothing much to do here, but it's a good place for photoshoot and for soul searching!"
132,3.0,"From all the reviews and pictures I thought it was going to be like on the reviews.  I was glad that it was not far from our hotel, so is about a 10 minutes to 15 minutes walk.  It is actually a long river area under the city but only one part of it looks pretty.  When we went to see it there was no lights or anything to see at all, I can not denied that it does make a very unique picture, but no decoration where happening during our visit.  I guess is because it was still cold."
133,5.0,The path is great to escape the noise and the cars. You can enjoy a nice walk with some pieces of art and see some birdsYou can go out at every bridges although the numbering is not chronological be careful
134,5.0,"Nice, relaxing, and good for a walk in downtown Seoul (especially during the summer). Would recommend as a free outing or pitstop."
135,5.0,We took the subway Line 5 to Gwanghwanun Station and steps away from the station is the Cheongye Plaza and the colourful blue & red Spring Sculpture that is the icon of the Cheongyecheon Stream restoration project. Just walking by the stream is so relaxing even though we're there in the afternoon. Not many people were around and we had a wonderful time taking lots of pictures. Just enjoyed the sound of the running water which is very clear. We walked for about half an hour and passing by many bridges.
136,4.0,"Such an charming place, waking from Dongdaemun to Myeongdong at the stream level was so peaceful, oblivious to the traffic just a street above. Ducks, cranes and fishes... It's like walking in a forest and yet, we were in the middle of town."
137,5.0,"We went during Christmas, so it was packed! They only let you in from one area and out another. The line was soooo crazy long, but the place was decorated with many hearts and Merry Christmas sign. Fun atmosphere with a concert, street foods, with tons of people! Again, this was during Christmas so if you visit during another time of the year, maybe less people and chaos."
138,5.0,"This is a very interesting project which got criticized a lot at the time, but is such an enchanted escape from the crowded city, in the middle of it!"
139,4.0,"A historical place, one can walk along the stream and enjoy the nice breezy atmosphere during autumn."
140,5.0,This is actually a monsoon drain converted into a stream and decorated into a park. The stream is at a lower level thus you will not see the roads at the stream. Nice to go during theme festivals as they will put up lightings.
141,3.0,"My bro went there over Xmas and he said there were lots of lights. But our family went during the lunar new year period and there weren't many lights. Only some rainbow lights at the beginning part of the stream. You can also throw coins into one section of the stream (try to aim into the center for good luck) and the coins would be donated to needy children. Quite a good cause, and a fun activity. All of us tried to aim for the center but it's not easy!We took a stroll down the stream (we just had a full dinner and needed a walk!) and there's some artwork along the sides. I think it would be nice to walk around here and play in some shallow parts of the water during summer time. You can also try to cross the stream by the rock placed. But we dare not try since it was a cold winter day and we didn't want to get wet!A fun outdoor activity with kids too."
142,5.0,This is a small river in the heart of Seoul. It was fully renovated 15 years ago and it is a special place to walk on the walkway beside the river. The water is extremelly clean and lantern festival takes place there on autumn season.
143,4.0,"The best time to go here is at night because that's when all the lights are turned on. Cheoggyecheon is very long that it passes through a lot of famous tourist spot such as dongdaemun, myeongdong, and gwanghwamun. This place is good if you want to walk at night while seeing beautiful lights lit up the stream. You can also discover Korean history there because some of the walls are painted with Korean history."
144,4.0,Although it was very cold and we visited during night time I could see why this was an attraction. An urban stream placed in the middle of the city is quite beautiful in sight.
145,4.0,"It was our second time to visit this stream. A very relaxing view of the clean stream in the middle of the busy city. It is best to stroll at night when there are wonderful lights  reflecting on the watermake sure to grab a cup of hot coffee to keep you warm especially when the wind blows in winter. Lots of food stalls, market and shops nearby, 10-15 mins walk to Dongdaemun Design Plaza, City Hall, Bukchon, and other tourist attraction"
146,5.0,Right in the middle of the city you can see this stream. We were there on 23rd January 2017 and it was still winter and there was snow. It was beautiful.
147,4.0,"The 2nd time I go this place, this time to me is the best view with Christmas decoration along the river, but cold wind make us can't go further to see the another view, this place are good for take a picture with all decorations."
148,5.0,"Our family visited in November during the Seoul Lantern Festival. Larger than life paper lanterns glow in the night and reflect off the water, creating elaborate scenes to take in. A highly recommended outing if you happen to be in Seoul during November."
149,5.0,Visited the lantern festival. Beautiful lanterns. Clean and well-maintained stream. A relaxing place in the middle of bustling city.
150,5.0,"We would often come here to eat lunch. There was a market near by and we would just eat and walk down the river. It was a busy place, but at the same time it was very peaceful."
151,4.0,"Its a nice place to walk during the cool day.  Can be very cold especially when the wind blows in winter.  Walk slowly and you will reach Gwanjang Market from the City Hall station.  If you have not been there, then you should make time to walk along the stream."
152,4.0,"I was walking south from Bukchon, passing through Insa-dong and came across this stream. It was during winter and Christmas decorations were everywhere. It was a good stroll at night towards the end where the man-made waterfall was.If this stream is along the way, it's good to visit and take a stroll. Grab a hot cup of coffee or egg-bun during cold winter, that would be fantastic. However, I don't recommend to come all the way to see the stream though unless you are passing through. I assume it's best to walk at night where the place starts to light up, even though I've not been there during daytime."
153,5.0,We used the stream as a great way to walk the city.. get a local map look for the bridge closest to the attractions you want to visit and then pop up when you come to the bridge.. it is a lovely walk and it cuts straight through the city
154,3.0,"An interesting way to present a drained area. Well though out and easy to walk along, free to enter and you can get some good pictures."
155,4.0,"Visit the stream, especially at night. To go here, take a subway to Dondaemon station (Line 1 or 4) Exit #8 or #9. There’s also shops selling Grill Fish (Muslim can go here to eat as well) and there are  lot of places to shop around this area (Dondaemon)."
156,4.0,Cute little stream cutting though middle part of Seoul. Pick it up near city hall and walk to the east. Take some pennies and make a wish! You can walk just above the river on the main street or descend some little steps and walk right next to it. Some nice decorations and features
157,4.0,nothing much to do except strolling and walking down the stream enjoying the atmosphere. there's a lot of stalls selling street foods for u to enjoy while walking
158,4.0,"I recommend taking a walk here when there are local events.  For example, recently my family with young children visited in the evening when there was a festival of night lanterns.  It was very pretty and the kids enjoyed all the lights."
159,3.0,"This stream have nothing special during the period I stayed. The water is clean and it provides a sort of nature flows in the busy CBD area. If you are going, look out for dates that the stream will be decorated, if not not worth going"
160,4.0,"It was colder out when we visited. Not as pretty as in the photos of summertime, but still a neat walk.  Less busy than the street and a different view. You can see small fish in the stream and the kids loved walking across the rocks at multiple locations.  Easy enough for a 6 and 9 year old to cross by themselves."
161,2.0,I do not see any things spectacular about how the  Korean created art in a sewage water stream. I would not visit it if I have nothing else to do.
162,5.0,When I travel to soul I was lucky because they have to many different lights in Cheonggyecheon street I am not sure but I think the lights are only 2 times a year
163,1.0,"this was an ok park. but probably not worth it. if you really must, just make a short trip. best place to see it is near jongno 3... other areas have not lighting at night"
164,4.0,Visited during the lantern festival which was amazing since they decorated the place with lanterns. Very nice to walk during evenings. Nice place for photos.
165,4.0,"Without much thoughts, you might be think it's just like usual canal. It's was their Lantern festival. The whole stream was filled with colours & sound of stream until the end. Even had a drawing done. Impressed & definitely satisfied. Free admission. Event changes from time to time. Beside stream there's an area which is similar to Ximending @Taipei or  Shibuya @Tokyo."
166,3.0,We popped by on our way to Dongdaemun. It is a refreshing spot in the busy city ... but you don't have to make a special trip there.
167,4.0,"It's really just a stream. Worth going to once if you're in Korea. If it's hot, you can even dip your feet in."
168,5.0,"We walked with kin pleasure. Kids were running and enjoying. River is very clean and nice. There are several a activities such as panting, creating some traditional masks, etc. The kids (and not only kids) are involved in that activities and it make them happy. I would recommend to everyone."
169,5.0,"One of our highlights in Seoul was the simplicity of the lovely stream. We visited by day and went back on our last night to see the beautiful lights which at the time included a rainbow arch. It was a stroll of only a few hundred metres from near our hotel to the Plaza but it was a lovely and peaceful walk with many photo opportunities. There were a lot of people out enjoying it - couples, groups of friends and visiting tourists. We felt very safe."
170,5.0,We took a walk along the Cheonggyecheon stream and it was very serene and soothing. The sound of water flowing in the stream makes it very pleasant to walk along and enjoy some calm time in the middle of Seoul. It's a really good place to walk for couples or families with young children or even if you want to take a quick run. There are shops around the stream but you've to take stairs to access those. I recommend this place if you're visiting Seoul!
171,4.0,Enjoyed walking along the stream around 4pm and then finishing off with some street food in MyeongDong.  Such a lovely peaceful place in the middle of a busy city.
172,5.0,"Discovered this gem in one of the guide books.A beautiful walk for miles,you would never believe you were going through a busy city as it is below street level."
173,5.0,"Very relaxing part of the city. The entire family enjoyed the walk along the stream. It was great to cool off our feet in the hot weather.If your into photography, there are many chances to take some great pictures.Or do some people watching.Saw a great mix of people there from families, dates, friends or people out for exercise.All were quiet, respectful of others and generally well behaved."
174,4.0,"good to walk around at night after shopping, can seat there with some local food and enjoy the quiet moment inside this busy city."
175,5.0,Longest walk I've ever done! It's nice to go here and start your walk on the afternoon until night time.

177,5.0,"Fabulously stream to walk. Sees the local family having picnic,the senior citizens gathering and exercise there. Wonderful place"
178,5.0,This is a awesome place...u can release the stress while walking around there...the surrounding are quite and beautiful
179,4.0,"Cheonggyecheon Stream is actually quite small in terms of size but very long as it flows into the heart of this bustling city and is considered one of the iconic and must visit place for visitors.Honestly, the best time to visit this place is at night, with its special and nice lightings, it presented a ""romantic"" atmosphere for married or dating couples. Its lovely and nice.Well, for us, as we were around the area (Dongdaemum) to do shopping and walk-around in the morning, so we dropped by this place after our shopping and it was almost noon time. It was not crowded then (as compared to the evening) perhaps due to the warm and sunny weather.One could walk down to the stream (from the road level) through a flight of metal stairs and can choose to sit along the stream to enjoy some calmness and tranquility away from the busy human and road traffic. Actually its not as warm there especially if you go underneath the bridge, quite cooling and its a good place (besides dating or catching up with friend) to relax, shelter for rain.So dropby this stream if you are in the city and remember to come at night and you will see another but more beautiful and lovely aspect of the stream.Highly recommended.* Actually I have recorded some videos of my travel trips but no way to upload here to share. Do contact me if you want to see and can catch them in my Youtube account!"
180,4.0,"The person who decided to create such a clean and great place in Seoul city, he deserves a medal.  Just imagine having to filter a polluted dirty river into a clear running stream through the city and creating such a pretty and unique place for people to walk around or to sit around on a good sunny day.  It is great to visit at night when the lights are on.  A must visit place when one goes to Seoul."
181,5.0,"Walking along the stream we enjoyed the trees, butterflies, fish and refreshing water.  During a very warm day it was perfect just to sit in the shade and dip your tired feet in the water. At nights colorful lighted."
182,4.0,"This is a great place to hang out at night, but beware of mosquitoes since you are near bushes and trees. I suggest finding out which part of the stream is the most lively since the part I went to was really quiet and the plants were really over-grown it's not as pretty as the pictures. The stream is quite long so I assume there are more ""popular"" sections than others.TIP: use mosquito repellent"
183,5.0,"great place to escape the bustle of the city, but yet remain in the city. Can paddle in the hot summer days and evenings, impressive light show at night."
184,5.0,The place is great to stroll around and have a bit of peace and quiet in the middle of the city.....
185,5.0,"This stream is amazing. It is so lovely to walk along, especially in the day because when it is really hot, people just sit along the edge and dip their toes in to cool down. There are also stepping stones across which are really cool. Definitely worth a trip if you have time!!!"
186,3.0,We walked by during the day and it was ok.  everyone had their feet in the water but was not allowed to walk around in it.  Maybe nicer at night or festival.
187,4.0,"This is great place for a stroll in central Seoul. It may not be terribly remarkable depending on where you come from, but certainly unique enough to add to your itinerary."
188,3.0,Its a nice place and cool too.. too bad i came at the wrong tiem as the sun was blazing hot that summer noon. Couldn't enjoy it that time. But it's nice just choose a different time. Lots of people hang out in there too.
189,4.0,"We were already in the area but we relied on Google - so we were brought to the other end of the stream - love wall  However, the more popular end with water falls and wishing well is at the other end.  If you are already in the Palace (I think the Gyeongbokgung), it is just at the end of the park (near an intersection).  Get a tourism map and review with your google."
190,5.0,"The stream is a great place for having a walk along the path and getting your feet cool in the water. Walked for many kms and loved every inch of it. Liked how locals come with children for story telling, reading and getting together. Do not miss."

194,4.0,"This is the place to watch the locals enjoying themselves watching the stream goes by and to do some brisk walking. My family took off our shoes and soak our tired feet in the cool water of the stream. Prior to the entrance leading to the stream there are booths selling snacks and drinks. If you decided you want to leave the stream, there are many  staircases on either side to exit and climb up to street level to catch up on your shopping and feasting."
195,3.0,"This stream is more than 600 yrs old. It's a public place where u can sit down to relax all day & all night. It's considered one of the best meeting point, there r lots of couples & friends hanging out. It's also walking distance to duty free shopping mall."
196,5.0,I was most impressed when I learned that this area was a swamp before and received a face lift to become a beautiful attraction.  Nighttime is especially pretty.
197,4.0,"It's a natural stream that goes around Seoul City Center, below the street level. I heard it used to be dirty and neglected but was nicely restored by the government with stair access at many locations, boardwalk.  It's well-lit at night.  Locals like to hang out there.  I strolled along part of it one evening and found the walk very refreshing after a hot, muggy day.  The water is very clean with fish if you look closely.  There are stepping stones at points where you can cross to the other side."
198,4.0,Pretty hot in summer to walk although still pleasant enough.  Best time to enjoy is during the Light Festival in Fall but be prepared to rub shoulders literally w the massive crowds.
199,5.0,If you are down by city hall you can't miss the steam. Honestly it's beautiful at night especially at sunset. Sit down put your toes in and watch the people go by. Especially nice in the middle of a Seoul summer!
200,5.0,"We walked by the Cheonggyecheon Stream every day from our hotel. It is a truly korean experience. Watch the locals and tourists enjoy the site all day long during their daily outings. Do not miss the light and sound show at night, free of charge. Take the time to sit under the bridges and just enjoy yourself. Safe and entertaining. Just do it!"

Around the stream there are often families and couples walking, especially during the weekend! The stream provides with the calmness the city doesn't have.Under a bridge you will come a cross if you continue walking there were a lot of people gathering and relaxing in the calm environment with their feet in the water. If you continue walking down the stream you will find how it just gets calmer and calmer. When you find the end, you can just walk up some stairs and there you will meet the whole civilization again.  During night you can just sit back and relax in the luke warm air and listen to music playing while watching the evening light dance in the water."
205,4.0,"This destination has caught my attention for every long time. I am impressed by the effort of the city that wanted to create such a wonderful public space in the heart of the city. It would be nice if we got there when they have some events or festivals. Would like to visit again, but I have to check the canal's schedules year round."

211,4.0,"If you're looking for some place to just sit back and relax, then Cheonggyecheon would be a great place to go and dip your feet in the cool  stream. I went just before sunset, so I got to enjoy both the stream during the day and the lights at night. It's nice for a quiet stroll, and you'll even come across street artists if you want to do something touristy and have your caricature made. When you've walked enough, there are plenty of coffee shops and restaurants lining the street so you can stop for a bite to eat as well."
212,4.0,We visited this place when it was the lotus lantern festival and it was amazing!!! We saw a lot of big size lanterns in different shapes. We an my kids love the time we spend there.For this festival is a must!
213,5.0,"This stream runs over a long distance. We enjoyed just a small part of it. It was beautiful. Next time, we will try to cover a much longer distance. It is beautifully maintained. Calm and peaceful!"
214,5.0,We walked along the stream during the day and at night - loved the area.  Lots of locals relaxing at lunch time.
215,5.0,"The place is perfect for taking photos. You can get on some pedestals in the middle of the stream, and there are some interesting decorations by the wall as well. A short visit will be sufficient, or you can just walk by the place."
216,4.0,"Lovely place for a stroll after a walk at Myeongdong street. If you are lucky, you get to see fishes around. We were happy they have lift to go down as we have a stroller with us."
217,4.0,a good outlet of relaxation in the middle of a busy city. the stream is so beautiful and serene. a must visit place in Seoul.
218,4.0,"Was quite surprised to see this in the heart of the city, which was apparently an initiative by one of the former mayors of the city. It's a lovely feature, and a great walk away from the congested roads. Well worth a visit."
219,4.0,"Cleverly functional and beautiful as well, this walkway joins a few shopping areas where you can come up from the side stairways bypassing the roads. Amazingly serene pocket in a sea of highly populated neighbourhoods. Enjoyed the evening walk."
220,5.0,Its actually water that comes down from the mountains. Its incredible to see how well lit abd decorated the place is. Also adds a natural effect in the middle of the city .
221,4.0,Nice little stream with a small light show.  Great photo spots.  Kinda stuck under the bridge and lots of small flying bugs in some areas.  Nothing too troublesome.  They had an OMAN exhibit around the middle of the stream.  It is worth a visit.
222,3.0,"After walking along Insadong we walked along the stream to get to the next market, was not too crowded so walking stress free, some nice nature, fish, birds surrounded by some highly concentrated markets"
223,5.0,"I love Cheonggyecheon not only because it's a pretty place to stroll, but because it represents Seoul's modern approach to the city. This linear park submerges you along the river where you can hop from one side to the other on large stones. You can see the city sky line and marvel at Koreas modernism. You can often see families out for a walk, and lovers trying to find a romantic place to pause. I like to walk westward after work on Fridays  - it's a peaceful and place to watch the sunset."
224,5.0,"The water is crystal clear.  At night, you can see big fish just resting behind the stones.  The place makes very nice pictures and it is really pleasant to just sit on the side with coffee, even on a cold day."
225,3.0,"I suggest starting before dusk at the City Hall end of the stream, tossing a coin in the wishing well for charity and then strolling along the river as long as you wish. Heard from my sister that sometimes bands play music along the river.. As a sightseeing destination it is just ok.. don't expect too much."
226,4.0,Fun trip and a beautiful area in the downtown of Seoul.  Demonstrates their cultural values and a relaxing place in a crowded city.
227,5.0,Try walking along this stream to understand the beauty of nature away from the city and technology. Its a good way to understand korean culture.
228,2.0,"i just like this place because of what they did a stream that became a tourist spot. they said it used to be dirty, but now it is really clean you can walk there and have a date with your love one. But still nothing so interesting, just go to a park near by it is better."
229,5.0,I highly recommend visiting this place as the river is very clean and has no foul smell. Very close to train stations and shopping areas.
230,5.0,"Only two years to tear down a highway and restore the river that was buried underground for decades. Do some research into the history and you will really appreciate what you are seeing. Bring your kids and let them waddle int he water, but remember to bring towels and fresh clothes to change them and not catch a cold!"
231,5.0,Cheonggyecheon stream is one of the major attractions of Seoul. It is worth visiting during the Lantern festival (During mid-November)
232,5.0,This is my 2nd times visited. Both times we visited are different in decoration. This place is very relaxing & clean.
233,5.0,"The lantern festival was beautiful on the stream. The line was really long, but moved quickly. The lanterns are just beautiful & it was a perfect location."
234,5.0,It would be the best if you come here chilling with your friends or even by yourself in the evening just before the sunset. Nice spot for chilling and walking at the heart of the city
235,5.0,"This is one of the ""must-sees"" in Seoul and one of the favourite relaxing spots for locals in the very centre of the city.The stream itself is few km long, so you can have a nice walk and chill-out. When we visited, there was some kind of ""eco-food"" festival on Cheonggyecheon Plaza, but steam had not any kind of ""festival"" (often there are lantern festivals and then it looks amazing). Nevertheless, Steam at night is highlighted and looks very nice. Perfect place for romantic walk or other family/relaxing activities."
236,5.0,We found this by accident and really enjoyed just sitting by the stream watching children play in the water.  We were among many just relaxing with our feet in the water on a hot evening.  Totally recommend it!!
237,4.0,Visit in the evening where the christmas lighting decorated the plaza and along the stream. Unfortunately the lighting decoration is only around 350m long and after that we found the regular lighting of the stream with a bit rough walkways.Still interesting to visit.
238,4.0,"My family and I visited Seoul in autumn. Thanks to our friendly vacation rental owner, we found out that there was a Lantern festival being held at the Cheonggyecheon Stream during our stay in Seoul. We really enjoyed our walk along the stream as we stop to admire each lantern piece. The lanterns were all very pretty and creative."
239,4.0,"Visited on a cold December night to view the special Christmas Light Up. it's beautiful,  a nice place to go for a stroll at night with friends and loved ones. The stretch that is lit is about 1 km in length. bring a good camera."
240,5.0,"Refreshing hideaway from the hustle and bustle above. The stream is beautiful at night because of the lights, tranquil in the day amidst the sounds of flowing water."
241,4.0,"This is a peaceful walk along a stream right in the middle of town. Easy to walk to while visiting the palaces. Lots of shopping and food along the way, just  take one of the many stairways up to the hustle and bustle of  Seoul."
242,4.0,Visiting here around 4.00 p.m and it was windy. We felt amazed because they can change the stream from the worst to be the best. Lights were everywhere and christmas decorations were being prepared. Definitely worth to visit this although it was very cold.
243,3.0,Nothing special and only walked along the stream.  Near to Myeongdong and therefore you may walk there when around the corner.
244,4.0,"Having read many good reviews of this environmental success of rejuvenating a heavily polluted stream, I have high expectation of see it. While it is indeed very clean and pleasant to walk, it is a bit too artificial and man-made with nothing really ""nature"". The source of the stream is just 100% city tap water, that is why it is so clean!"
245,5.0,"This place is absolutely beautiful, most especially nice at night. There's a spot there where they have a laser light show set against sprays of water. It's really nice to take a stroll along the banks, and its history is also pretty interesting."
246,4.0,Went there because I heard that there is a lantern festival along the stream. Love the place so much.The latern display was good and the breeze to just slowly walk along the stream was relaxing.This is a great place to go once the shops closes at night.
247,4.0,"I can say this is the first stop I did in Seoul. Despite the demonstrations that day, I found this quite nice because it coincided with the lantern parade where lantern and models showcasing Korea and other countries light up the stream. It is a nice walk through and ingenious idea of fusing urbanization and environmental consciousness."
248,1.0,"We went at night for the start of Lantern Festival.  They had a ceremony with VIP seating and they got to walk along the river first.  Down by the river was closed to the public for about 30-40 minutes, but you could still see well from on top.  The first few lanterns on display were great, but then they had so many that were there as advertisements and we didn't enjoy them as well.  Lots of street food and vendors."
249,5.0,Little stream made in such a beautiful way that I couldn't enjoy hopping around and have my own fun. It is something must see for people who come from outside. We heard Christmas Choir outside as we visited during December.
250,3.0,"Cheonggyecheon is a stream that flows through the streets of Seoul, not far from other attractions... unfortunately there's not much else to say as that single sentence tells you all you need to know about the stream.If you're already in the area for different activities, it's worth a visit as a water feature in the middle of a busy day of sightseeing can prove to be relaxing, however, it's nothing you should plan your day around for.The stream is beautifully lit at night, though, and that may prove to be a better experience.If you're lucky enough to swing by during November (or any other festivals that may be going on) you would be treated to some beautiful decorations and festivities.But again... don't expect too much as this is still just a stream."
251,3.0,"We went there at night and it was just too dark. Although it was very refreshing to walk at the sidewalk and enjoy the calmness of the water. I think it is better to visit it in the morning especially if there are no events at night to make the place livelier.The stream is near the market where you can enjoy korean food such as kimbap, soondae (blood sausage), odeng (fish cake) and tteokboki."
252,4.0,"We rested here a bit after the palace and Gwanghamun square. It was a good immersion to the Korean population since a lot of locals spend their time here, some with family, some with lover.Take a stroll too, since this stream is a bit long. Don;t forget to make a wish at the head, too!"
253,4.0,"This is near our 1st hotel so we walked to this stream early morning after breakfast. We had a good weather cold and breezy but not raining, we were able to take pictures of the stream with the artworks, and also the cute artsy benches that were there. I think everywhere in Seoul is just picture worthy, they always have unique stuffs for tourists. The stream is long and clean but it looks better at night with those lights. That's why I thnk many couples were there during the night cause they find it more romantic."
254,4.0,Cheonggyecheon stream is a place that can we fulfill the leisure time...Besides is the place that need to visit when u traveling to KOREA....
255,4.0,An unusual attraction in the middle of the 2nd largest city in the world.  They just need to keep the grass trimmed more often!
256,4.0,This little stream that runs through the city of Seoul is really long and we were only able to visit a small portion of it. Nevertheless it was a cool and refreshing pit stop for our family on a hot summer day!
257,4.0,"This was a cleaned up stream in the middle of skyscrapers which offers you a place to rest your tired feet during your shopping or sightseeing. It's near the city hall station, U.S. Embassy and king Sejong square."
258,3.0,"We passed by the Cheonggyecheon Stream several times during our week in Seoul, it's close to a number of other attractions. Not sure what I was expecting, but I found it slightly disappointing, the busy city roads and businesses are close to the stream and the path alongside in the channel. It is free and the construction and operation are impressive though. The path by the stream-side was closed on one day as adverse weather was forecast.It may be better to visit at night."
259,5.0,This stream is a nice area for a short rest and relax - the stream actually is a middle of some of the places of interest in Seoul as well.
260,5.0,"Nice stream with in city, behind Seoul city hall. Nice for everyone with in family, soak your feet in stream, talk, lovers, family.Maybe better to go after sun down."
261,5.0,"This stream is just beautiful at any time of day. The Korean's have done a fantastic job in bringing this stream back to life. It is very relaxing to walk along and the stream changes from open areas to trees, waterfalls, rocks to cross the stream. The locals also love to dip their feet in on a hot day and have a picnic beside it. If you are nearby it is a great way to divert from the busy sidewalks at street level."
262,4.0,"Surely make sure to visit this stream and start from the citi plaza side. You can wet your feet, relax, ..."
263,5.0,"What amazed me more was how can Seoul people turned this stream into a clean & stunning spot from the polluted stream in the past. Better to come here at night after dinner to enjoy your own time to the max. I've been here 3 times in my previous 3 visits to Seoul & each time they had different lighting festivals (very coincidently), which brought me even more surprised & of course, have to keep visiting again & again."
264,4.0,"A nice escape in the middle of Seoul. There are lots of places to sit and relax. It's great to hear the water sounds and enjoy some trees. Conveniently located near businesses, shopping and restaurants. A great way to walk between Tongdaemunand Kwanghwamun. It's a huge improvement over the ugly street that used to cover it and rather than increasing traffic by taking away that busy street, I think traffic has overall been reduced in the area."
265,5.0,Have visited the stream several times in the last few months. My kids love to go down and stick their feet in the water and see the fish. Very relaxing and no crowds to speak of once you get down on the path.Nice fountains scattered along the way as well.Go and you will love it!
266,5.0,"A great way to escape the heat by dipping your feet in the water with the fishies. Great for all ages but children love watching the fish. Easy to find, clean and a great escape from the noise of the city."
267,4.0,Our friend took us to this stream for a walk and it's a refreshing change to the rest of the city. There's even an art gallery under one of the bridges. Worth a look.
268,5.0,"A quiet and peaceful green haven in the heart of the city. The further away you go from the Gwanghwamun end, the wilder and greener it becomes. Stepping stones add fun and whimsy. You'll see only dog-walkers, old men feeding the fish, joggers and lovers.  A great slice of Seoul life."
269,4.0,"Really nice place to take your significant other. It has beautiful lamp festivals during certain times of the year and is always good for a nice walk and a beer. Be prepared for horrible parking arrangements they may cost ₩20,000 plus for a couple hours. Additionally avoid that lotte duty free traffic if at all possible haha. Enjoy."
270,4.0,"Cheonggyecheon stream is a beautiful and clean break from the hustle and bustle of Seoul. Before coming to Korea, I was really amazed with how the government took the initiative to rehabilitate the stream. Seeing it first hand showed me how successful that gamble was. In our trip, I visited it twice. My first first visit was in early Sunday morning. I expected more people when I went there but I guess it was time for people to rest. The stream was very clean and relaxing. I seemed like a good place to do a morning jog too. I was delighted to see a huge bird hover across the stream as well. My second visit was the section near the plaza in front of Gyeongbokgung palace. It was section with a wishing section and had floats and displays. There were lots of people, locals and tourists, just enjoying the park. If you're an old soul like me looking for places to relax and sightsee when you travel, this is a good place to go to :)"
271,4.0,"Best time to come during autumn and cherry blossom. Recommended for evening walk to release energy drain. Don't expect any cultural show, street performance or busker."
272,5.0,I've visited the Stream many times throughout the year and almost every time it has a different theme or display up.  It's such a peaceful spot in the center of the city. This month is has lovely lanterns strung all along it in celebration of Buddha's birthday.  There's fun shopping nearby and a ton of coffee shops to help you relax!
273,4.0,"This is a lovely place for a walk, especially when the weather is good. While many people walk along Cheonggyecheon stream, it doesn't get over-crowded. There's always a calming, relaxing feel when you walk along this clean, clear stream, watching the leaves sway in the breeze, the fish swimming against the flow of water, ducks paddling happily, and here you'll find people of all ages, from the very young to the very old. If you need to relax and clear your mind - this is the right place to go to! The mural along one of the walls is very long and extensive - with several information boards explaining what is depicted along the way."
274,5.0,"Just walking along the stream there is so much to see, at night there is a light exhibit that is great. It is a must see in Seoul."
275,4.0,"This place is great during the lantern festival at night when it's full of dozens of lit up, huge lanterns.  Other than that there's nothing special.  It's a nice break from the continuous streets and sky scrapers of Seoul, but that's it."
276,5.0,This is my favorite spot in Seoul. It is beautiful and there're are several spots where you can cross the stream. I would like to see similar reclamations of other lost wonders.
277,5.0,A walk down Cheonggyecheon is always beautiful and romantic. so much so that i proposed on the crossing stones here. She said yes.
278,4.0,"I really like walking along Cheonggyecheon Steam. The last time I was there was during the Seoul Lantern Festival and it was just amazing! I didn't mind the long walk because my eyes were feasting on the beautiful lanterns. Aside from that, the sound of the water running down the stream was pretty relaxing. One of my favorite places in Seoul to just stroll around and chill."
279,5.0,I want to sit and relax here. Not minding my work or anything. Just experience the cool breeze of this place is perfect for every moment.
280,3.0,The place is good but nothing to do much there. I see some couple spend their time together apart from that i think it's just a normal place to visit but nothing much.
281,4.0,"The Cheonggyechon (Chon-Gi-Chon) stream was a big issue on local public debate since created during the recent decade. Some argue that this is a ""fake"" nature, as the water are actually recycled by pumps and filters. Others blamed mayor (and president to be after that) Lee BK in wasting public money. However, this project created a nice spot in the center of  a busy area, attracting many tourists, local and foreigners alike, One can stroll for lunch time with friend or colleagues, families spend here some hours, letting their kids run in a safe environment. Occasionally there are exhibitions and events, such as the Lights festival (I forgot its real name...)."
282,4.0,"My family went during winter, so the stream was really quite picturesque as there were snow banks on both sides and also not many people crazy enough to brave slipping on the ice to try walking on the stepping stones."
283,5.0,"In the middle of a large asian city it was a surprise to find a clean, unpolluted stream. There are landscaped walkways alongside the stream with regular opportunities to cross the stream on conveniently placed stones. Locals were picnicking on the banks of the stream under the road bridges so as to keep out of the sun. My son happily played in the water. Seoul puts many other cities to shame; Seoul has turned a city stream into an asset."
284,5.0,"A really nice place to visit in the evening.The stream creates a boulevard, where on each side there is a road, and in the middle there is a sunken area, where pedestrians can stroll on promenades on both sides of the stream.A lot of young people, romantic surroundings (the soft lights of the promenade, the trees around and the lights of the skyscrapers on the street level), away from the noise of traffic and people on the streets, pleasant atmosphere. It has different areas designed in many styles and designs - some maybe look too colorful, some more romantic, but it's very nice to stroll there.It became my favorite place in Seoul.For wheelchair users: there are several places where you can use an elevator to descend to the stream level. There are maps on the street, where you can see where they are. But if you go from Cheonggye square (which is also nice to visit, at least at night), near the Candle fountain, you don't even need an elevator - you can descend via the moderate slope.By the way, somewhere in the middle we got back to the street level and found out a nice pedestrian area with local foods, but I don't really know its name."
285,4.0,"The very existence of CheongGyeCheon is stunning. If you happen to stumble upon it without nothin such a jewel actually stands there, you will be in awe with this amazing urban project. The two most impressive things about the water stream are its length: 11km (7 miles) perfectly restored ; and how peaceful it is. To fully immerse into CheongGyeCheon, you have to walk by the river. You will hear the water flowing, enjoy the plants and the lighting, and completely forget that you're in the heart of one of the world's busiest cities. I""m not rating it a 5* because no matter how perfectly designed this project was, it still is ""only"" a small river/stream, and has little else to offer behind enjoying the walk. A must-see nonetheless!"
286,5.0,Was a nice break in the middle of the city to have a walking path along the man-made river. Small art display in one of the overpasses.
287,5.0,"This is a nice place to join the locals in the evening where the stream looks magical with the lights.  The waterfall is an ideal place for picture taking.  It is a very cool place in the evenings, a very nice respite from the summer sun.  You can sit on the bank with your feet on the water while listening to the music.  Or you can drink coffee in a cafe along the street."
288,2.0,"This 3 km long fountain of artificial stream is a typical example of complete failure of bureaucratic policy that was politically motivated for the presidential ambition of then-mayor, Lee Myung-Bak. Ineffective and environmentally unfriendly, it cost millions of dollars to build and another millions of dollars to maintain ever since.However, there is one thing that compensate for your disappointment. Go to the subway exit no. 8 or 9 at Dongdaemun station(Line 1 or 4)  to reach Beodeuldari Bridge where the statue of Jeon Tae-il is located, who burnt himself to death in 1970. He was a poor garment worker when South Korea was the bottom of international hierarchy of garment industry, and his wishes upon death were heartbreaking: reduce working hours from 14 to 12 hours per day, and have Sundays off at least twice per month. He was the beginning of labor union movement, and he was the one who brought people together to fight for democracy in South Korea.Low-profile as his life was, his statue is not even mentioned in the official tour guidebook or website of Cheonggyecheon in Seoul. Still, if you are the kind of person who is aware that most clothes we wear are made by garment workers in hideous working condition in Bangladesh that is the bottom of international hierarchy of garment industry today, why don't you stop by and pay tribute to this unsung hero? His dreams remain unattained as millions of people in Korea still work more than 12 hours per day for a living below poverty line."
289,5.0,"Be it day time or night time, the Cheonggyecheon Stream is a must visit...it has its own charm where in summer you can see local couples sat by the stream just to be with each other and it is a very unique place to be...do visit the stream if you have the time plus it is very near the famous shopping district(Dongdaemun) if you happen to be there"
290,4.0,"I believe the stream is about a mile long or so.  It is near the Myeong Dong (popular for shopping and local eats) and walking distance from the subway station for ""Uljiro Entrance"" and City Hall.  It is a relaxing place for many workers in downtown, and we saw a lot of them eat they lunch or just chill out during lunch hour.  I would have been sorry if I did not visit."
291,5.0,"I went on a day time and start at the start of Cheonggyecheon which is near to Gwanghwamun Square. It was a lovely walk with view of the stream, fishes, wind and greeneries. There are a total of 22 bridges if you walk all the way to the end. I walked until Samilgyo (bridge) and went up the stairs and continue my journey to Insadong."
292,3.0,Went there in the morning. Not very crowded. The place looks more like long and big drain with pavement on both sides. Statutes were placed in the water area for display. Not so decorative or beautiful in the day. Maybe more beautiful and decorative in the evening.
293,4.0,"Cheonggyecheon is probably a testament to what the Koreans can do. If you look at it's history, it used to be this dirty little stream but now, it's so clear and probably clean enough to drink!! It's a wonderful place to just hang out with friends, sit under the bridge and relax. Or you can choose to just walk down the stream all the way which comes up to about 6km I think...not too sure but only attempt it if you have lots of time and don't mind breaking your legs :p When I was there, they were gearing up for Buddha's Birthday celebration and they had all these displays along the river. On a more somber note, they also had a section where people could write messages on yellow ribbons and tie it on fences along the stream in memory of the Sewol tragedy. There are plenty of cafes around this area for those who wants to enjoy a cuppa. This is a place to go if you just want to have a relaxing day in the city and to sit back and watch the world goes by."
294,5.0,Cheonggyecheon is a whole community area that has been created around the river that flows in the city centre of Seoul. You will find all kinds of events and activities throughout the year. There are also a number of restaurants around the area.
