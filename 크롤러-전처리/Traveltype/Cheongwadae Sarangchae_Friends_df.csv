There are some cool spots for you to take photo like president's car with body guards surrounds you. I also admire some old ancient things at the exhibition room on the 2nd floor. You can buy some cute and meaningful souvenirs at the souvenir shop then have a drink at the coffee shop beside and chatting with friends. Have fun their! I took so many fun videos here"

You can also see the gifts that Korean presidents and other countries exchange with each other. In front of the memorial hall you take a scenery picture with the mountain, and couple of minutes from there you can take a look of the front part of Blue House."
