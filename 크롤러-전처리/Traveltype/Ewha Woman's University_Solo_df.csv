0,2.0,It's disappointing because it's closed for tourists because of corona virus pandemic. Come when corona virus ia gone
1,3.0,"C ( 18.10.29 )I visited there on my way to promise. There was good to foreign traveler, but for Korean there was just normal street. Once upon a time, there was crowded by traveler and shopper, but now just so-so."
2,4.0,"Great for shopping, targeted at the younger generation and ladies. Less crowded than Myeongdong so walking around was more comfortable. The street food carts also sells at a cheaper price. Not so much of skincare shops, it has mixture of clothes and accessories (socks, earrings etc). There is also a LINE store and I visited Ewha Woman's University.Visited here last year..."
3,4.0,"There are many korean brands cosmetics shop everywhere,  Ewha university is so close to the station, street foods are delicious."
4,4.0,Yes myongdong has more to offer but this is a university district and the clothes here are comparatively cheaper than dongdaemun and myeongdong area!
5,4.0,I was able to find a few relatively cheap coats and sweaters in a few shops along this street but must really dig deep for it. I like the general style of the clothes sold here.
6,4.0,"Ewha Fashion and Shopping Street can be an alternative than Myeongdong for cosmetics and fashion shopping. You can drop by Ewha Women University, take pictures in front of the famous Ewha main gate and explore the shopping street after. The main shopping street filled with mostly cosmetics shops. They have a wide range of brand options with reasonable price. You can also find street food vendors in the main street. Out of the main street, you can stroll to find fashion outlets also with a cheap price. That because their main customers are college students. However, for your notes, the clothes they sell here are not type of clothes you can wear for a long time. They are kind of clothes that keeping up with mode and season with short cycle. Also the reason for a cheap price. Line Cafe also available on the same street along with fashion outlets. I will truly recommend this place for everyone who wants to avoid the crowded Myeongdong."
7,4.0,Right next to the Campus. Lots of Coffes and some restaurants to choose. Good shopping as well around
8,5.0,"Lined up with major beauty product stores such as Etude House, Missha, A'pieu, Laneige, Tony Moly, Holika Holika, Innisfree, Skin Food, etc. I got most of my beauty haul here. Not too crowded and some promos are better than the ones i found in Myeongdong."
9,4.0,Fairly easy to get to- didn't have any expectations because I went here on a whim. Not as big as many other places but it's quite affordable and there's a lot of stylish trends here. You'll find many in style shoes and accessories as well as some food places!
10,4.0,"There's just so much you can buy here because of the affordable prices! You will be able to see many shops selling similar design of clothes and bags and shoes in other places but much more expensive. But here, price is good! Street food is good too:))"
11,4.0,"The streets & alleys around Ewha Womans University have tons of fashion & girly things in the affordable price! You can get cloth, bag, shoes, accessories, cosmetics, gadget, etc. More over, there are a lot of salons with reasonable price."
12,4.0,"This area is a great shopping area for young ladies as it located close to Ewha Women's university with lots of the cosmetic, clothing, cafe and some street food, but there are not many restaurants in the area."
13,4.0,"If you think Myengdong is too big and takes too much of your time shopping, go to Ewha's Fashion Street. It is not as crowded and Myengdong nor it has as many shops, that just makes you feel lost... Whenever I go to Myengdong I feel lost and I walk all around the same place many times, some of the streets even looks the same with the same shops around the place!! but Ewha is different. It has a few streets that are filled up with different stores/stands. You can easily find what you're looking for and you do not have to spend too much time. Also, there is enough of street food and cafe's where you can rest or meet someone. Other than that, make sure to visit the University campus, especially during Spring. it is BEAUTIFUL."
14,4.0,"Less manic and chaotic than Myeongdong although there isn't quite as much choice (understandably).I strongly recommend you visit a cosmetics store Baviphat that sells numerous Korean cosmetics brands - I've read some reviews/posts suggesting that they sell fakes but the items seemed genuine enough. I am a big fan of a brand Too Cool For School and I got several items from there for 2/3 of the price that I would have paid in a regular TCFS shop. I recommend you have a look in Baviphat before purchasing cosmetics elsewhere. Beware that not all items have testers, but if you get pally with one of the sales assistants, they'll open a sealed item for you to have a look and try. I have 'saved' about KRW 20,000 by buying my Too Cool For School cosmetics here. Also bring your passport to get the items tax free.There are some cutesy shops selling Korean jewellery and many clothes and shoe shops. Most shops don't let you try tops on - it's 'free size' hence you can't try it on. I don't see the logic behind this, I've asked the sales assistant why and even explained that, as a Westerner, I am a different shape and I wasn't even wearing makeup so I wouldn't stain the tops etc but it didn't work. I stumbled across a cute clothes shop called 'Banana +' where I picked up a beautiful embroidered blouse and so inspected it for loose threads etc (KRW 39,000) but as I went to paid for it, the shop assistant didn't let me have that one - she just whisked another one off the shelf (that wasn't on a hanger on display) and put it in the shopping bag. Needless to say, the one she sold me, as I found out once I got back to my hotel, is full of loose threads and a seam is falling apart - check the item before leaving the store as most places don't accept returns.I've spent about 3 hours here and came back a lot poorer but most of the shoes and fashion items sold here are not unique to Ewha - you can see the same items in Hongdae and in numerous underground malls. Still, a successful shopping day and I'm glad my husband decided to stay in the hotel as he would have hated every second of it."
15,5.0,I wish I spent more time here. I went to Sinchon for a hair cut at Lucy's Hair and then walked to Ewha. It was busy here especially in the evening. I came across a restaurant for anchovy noodles which was so cheap! Lots of bars and cool stores for young people.
16,4.0,I came here to shop after visiting Ewha Women's University. Some of the prices are similar to things to buy in Myeongdong but some of them are cheaper!! I prefer the environment here compared to Myeongdong too because there are less tourists and not so crowded. Definitely recommending the girls to go!
17,4.0,"Tons of clothing, accessory, shoes and makeup stores lining the whole area. Great place to shop on a budget, prices are relatively cheaper here than in Myeongdong. There are a lot of cafes and casual restaurants too. Set aside half a day for serious shopping."
18,5.0,"This place is absolutely girl's shopping paradise. Bags, clothing, accessories, cosmetics and etc.You can find cheap buys at most of the shops. Starting from ₩10,000 - ₩30,000. I recommend IT GIRLS  (the shop name) their apparels are affordable and fashionable. The retail assistance are friendly and they can speak little English.   Food around the vicinity are affordable as well. Probably because cater to the university students. Explore the narrow alley there are several quaint cafes. Coffee, soft serve, waffles etc.Kindly take note shops close at around 10pm or maybe earlier during weekdays. While weekends it depends on certain shop's operating time. I recommend you to drop by in the day for your shopping spree. And hop over to Hongdae in the evening for your barbecue fix. Just 2 subway stops away."
19,5.0,"You can easily find clothes 5000 krw onwards and shoes 10000 krw onwards. There are also several cosmetics stores like laneige, nature republic etc. The shops along the main road are usually slightly more expensive, while the shops which are hidden inside the street are cheaper. The shops and street layout is more spacious compared to Hongdik, every shops are cramped very close to one another."
