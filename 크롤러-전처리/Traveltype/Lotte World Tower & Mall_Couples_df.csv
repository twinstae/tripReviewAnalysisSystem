0,3.0,"I enjoyed the view of Seoul, but given the sometimes foggy/smoggy local air you need to pick a good day to visit.I was struck by how similar the observation decks of really tall buildings are.  If you have been to the Empire State Building or Sears tower then your experience will be very similar here, but it will be a different view."
1,3.0,"Incredible views, no doubt. However, zero information about the building. A 2 hour wait in a boiling, non air conditioned room will suck the excitement out of the activity. Nothing to do upstairs and the terrace is totally closed off so it’s not any more interesting than looking from the window."
2,5.0,"I am puzzled by the review I just read.  I thought this was a great observation deck, and they spoke English very well.   They answered all of my questions.   And most observation decks I have been to have very few elevators.  And some sort of wait.  It took all of 10 minutes to get to the top for us, and it started out with a bang.  The digital wall reveal is amazing. The outside deck  was scary fun.  All of the electronic assists, in letting you know what you are looking at was great techA bit on the pricier side, but still cheaper than The Empire State Building or 30 Rock."
3,5.0,This is a very beautiful building from the outside. You can then take the ride up to the top for about $25 each. Give yourself at least an hour and preferably two hours. It was not very busy when we visited but there are multiple queues that take at least 30 - 40 minutes to get to the elevators even on a slow period. You can book ahead online to insure faster entrance. The views are awesome and there is a glass floor. This is a must do.
4,5.0,"Great view around the lake nearby lotte tower. The nearest toilets can be found on nearby restaurants.  Best view at the park on left side of lotte world facing lotte world from this picture. Use naver to navigate when commuting.  There are mopeds, scooters and bikes thru applications too if you want to go biking, it is located near bus stations, 500₩ / hr use.  You must install app first e.g.mobike"
5,4.0,"You’re probably here for the tower, it’s the 8th tallest in the world and offers some incredible views of what I consider to be a beautiful city. We didn’t spend much time in the mall, only making our way to and from the tower, but it seemed a shoppers paradise!The tower itself is incredible! Well designed and a good experience for patrons, we had a seat at the bar over looking the 1988 Olympic site. Drinks were expensive, but we were on top of the city so we didn’t mind. Coming down from the tower we managed to get lost going to the duty free area. It was somewhat difficult to get back to the regular mall as the lifts didn’t indicate which building you were in!"
6,4.0,Being the 5th tallest building in the world this is well worth a visit. At the top of the Tower there is a glass floor allowing you to see all the way down. Bit pricey but worth it.
7,4.0,"It was really beautiful inside. Lots of duty free shops for cosmetics (worth a visit) and cheaper than the regular market. went on top to the sky deck as well, beautiful city views"
8,5.0,We took our grandkids to Lotte World and couldn't believe how special this was...it is literally a mini-Disneyland within the mall.  Terrific (some scary) rides and plenty of options for many age groups.  Everything is run efficiently and there are plenty of food options for all.
9,5.0,This wonderful place to shop or spend your evening strolling around at the lake just outside the mall. Blessed with good weather and cherry blossom last week. To get here was easy with the subway.
10,5.0,"Lotte tower, The 5th tallest building in the world. Amazing feeling when you get on top with scenic view of Seoul. there is also a big shopping mall in the building with a lot of shops and food choices."
11,4.0,"We visited the Lotte World Tower in February, only visiting the Mall as a means of accessing the Tower.  Quite a pricey visit, although we were pleasantly surprised to receive a discount for using a Mastercard to pay for our tickets, which then worked out at 48000 KrWon for two of us.  There are a number of corridors to walk through, with images screened on the walls, before you arrive at the elevator - a double decker and very fast. You also have the opportunity to have a photo taken with a chosen image on a green screen behind you, a similar opportunity is in place at the top of the tower, but there is no pressure to take part.It was all relatively quiet at this time of year but the length of corridors and screens indicate that they are there to keep visitors engaged during the busy season and that queues could get extremely long.The lift ride up to the 117th floor was rapid, ears popping en route, and more images being screened on the walls of the lift as we travelled.The public floors at the top of the tower are more compact than one would imagine, well organised with plenty of seating around the central section. We felt it was far less commercialised than Taipei 101, with plenty of staff available but a pretty much hands off approach.There is a glass floor section for the brave, where you can look out or down over 100 floors.  Not for the faint-hearted but a good photo opportunity.  There are also two 'observation decks', which have a double door arrangement to maintain temperature within the tower.  A member of staff regulates entry and exit to these decks. It was dark by the time we accessed these, the buildings were all lit up and car lights blended in along the roads out of the city and it was spectacular.Views are wonderful.  I don't think Seoul is a particularly attractive city, but this was a good way to see it and the height added something.  The skies had been clear blue when we entered the Mall but, unfortunately, by the time we emerged at the top, everything was rather misty and cloudy, hence our best photos came after the sun set.  Any visit is at the mercy of the weather and, particularly in February, you do take a calculated risk if you are hoping for good photos.There are a number of retail outlets at the top of the tower with, as one would expect, Tower themed souvenirs, ranging from postcards to much more ambitious items.  Prices not as hyped up as one might imagine.  Bizarrely a 'pick n mix' sweet counter and a cafe, an ice cream counter and a bar lounge.We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and would recommend it."
12,2.0,"It's huge , super cool. Many VR games/ rides. BUT... for almost all the main rides and popular rides, the waiting long is super long.  It takes about 1.5 hours to 2 hours waiting in the queue per ride.... I didn't get to do much... only a couple. I waited for a roller coaster for 2 hours... and realized... all other rides are like that too. And, i arrive at 9:30AM early... still need to wait ."
13,5.0,"So Lotte World is an indoor amusement park. I was a little burnt out on the malls in Seoul, but I did see a guitar shop which was neat. The amusement park was pretty cool, lots of English everywhere, and the rides were fun, but the highlight for me was the folk museum.Maybe it was just because it was quieter than many of my experiences in Seoul, but it was a welcome break from the cutting edge tourism experience. The folk museum presented Korean history in engaging dioramas and excellent placards explaining the different historical periods of Korea. The highlight of the highlight though, were the huge handmade dioramas of traditional Korean life. The care and thought that went into them is enough reason to visit the museum. One of my trip highlights!"
14,5.0,This rather large collection of figurines showing scenes of the ancient life in Korea is very beautiful and worth spending one hour.
15,2.0,My wife and I have travelling through Asia for last 3 months and I needed shaving supplies. We stopped at Lottie’s for some supplies. When the clerk helping understood I wanted travel size products she suddenly could not speak English. I made my way down to the grocery store where the staff bent over backwards to help.  Perhaps boutique staff could learn a thing or 2 from them.
16,4.0,"It's 121 floors, about USD25 to enter but worth the view.  Seoul is often foggy/smoggy, so if you can choose a time to go would recommend, but worth the trip."
17,5.0,Lotte World Tower with its Seoul Sky should be on the list when visiting the city.It gives you a nice view over the city and is reasonably priced compared to other similar viewing platforms in other cities around the world.It was also surprisingly empty when we visited and the fact that it is stretched over 3 floors further gives you more space to roam around.They also have a small restaurant with a few selected dishes on the fourth floor.
18,5.0,An awesome experience by all. The whole area adjoining this huge megaplex is fantastic and classy. Top floor was great and worth it.
19,4.0,I love to visit sight seeing towers whenever I go to a new city. It gives you a wonderful view of the city and this one was great. Being able to see a lot of the Olympic facilities was really awesome.
20,4.0,Coming from the malls of Bangkok this mall feels about normal. Nice and clean and busy. We wandered for and hour and it was fine.
21,5.0,"A large mall with lots of American and Korean labeled retail stores. There was a Mac store, North Face store, Apple store, and etc. The high end stores are there as well such as LV, Chanel, Burberry, Gucci and so forth. There were several restaurants to choose from, including a P.F. Chang’s and other local favorites. The Hard Rock restaurant just closed."
22,5.0,The Lotte World Tower & Mall is the perfect spot for tourists who are in Seoul for the first time. With 28.000 KRW per adult it’s a bit expensive but in my opinion it‘s worth it. You can easily get there by metro since there‘s a station right beneath it.The view up there is amazing and you‘ll get a hint about the massive size of the city.Definetly a recommendation.
23,5.0,"This is one of the tallest buildings in the world where you can have a panoramic view of Seoul and the famous Han River.  On 118/F, it's time to show your courage!  The glass floor is there waiting for courageous men to step on it!  Looking down through the glass can make you shake and worried if the glass breaks at any second you are staying on it!  I was just so amazed how kids fear nothing - they lay on it and they even jumped up and down!  ""STOP PLEASE!!!"" I screamed in my heart!Tip: Check the sunset time and plan your trip.  It admits limited people in each time slot so reserve your ticket early.  Sunset view on the glass is the definite thing you want to try!"
24,5.0,"Upon entering this building your taught all about the building with some cool effects and oleds screens the size of the room. Stunning. Then you finally get into a double decker elevator that rockets you to the top, fastest in the world. The effects inside the elevator also cool. Then your brought to the observatory floors and you start to act like a kid. 360 views of the city and also below your feet. Both sides have glass floors, so there really isn't a line to wait to walk on glass. Theres a cafe, wifi, and some cool museum pieces. I got to to look at Napoleans hat and some hand written letters by him.. who would have thought while touring in Korea I would get some french history under my belt. Great for all types of tourists! And theres a theme park in this mega mall too, and a hotel so i suggest booking a few days here."
25,5.0,This is so huge that its is impossible to completely traverse the whole place. One can get almost anything here. The lotte mart below is also very nice and reasonable price wise.on the top is the lotte tower which gives the entire city view from the 123rd floor.Good places to eat as well.
26,4.0,"We went early, and they have an early bird special so before noon it was a few thousand won cheaper. Since the building is on the east side of the city, if you go in the morning the sun will be behind you and you'll have a nice view to the rest of the city of the west. It turned out to be a really good view. I would also assume sunset is the other best time to go. Most of the floors are the same and it's your standard ""going up a tall building"" experience with a fancy elevator ride and an expensive gift shop up on the top. Seoul isn't really gorgeous from this eastern part of the city and the view consists mostly of endless rows of apartment blocks, Lotte World, hills, and the admittedly impressive Han River. There is no Hong Kong-or-NYC-style standout skyline feature of Seoul to see from here because you're standing in it."
27,5.0,"Located in the southern region of Seoul below the Han river, Lotte World Tower is one of the city's must-see attractions. At almost a half a kilometre tall (over 1,600 feet), on a sunny day it can cast a shadow in the sky and provides stunning 360 degree views of the vast metropolis. Taking only around sixty seconds to reach the multi-level viewing deck, you can step onto caged outside balconies, stand on a glass floor looking down onto busy traffic, take photos with ubiquitous kawaii mascots and marvel at the flawless overall undertaking and accompanying production (LED screens, computer graphics). Unlike other sky-high decks visited, the attraction doesn't have add-on charges for other experiences once you're up there - a welcome change to the usual tourist up-sell. Visited on a weekday, the number of visitors was relatively low and allowed ample opportunities to take the perfect photo. Entry is via the basement, which is part of the larger Lotte World mall.The mall itself offers plenty of local and international fashion brands in addition to a vast variety of retail, loads of food and beverage options and can be travelled to and from via the complex's underground railway station. The mall is spread over two buildings, one of which is the glamorous home to upscale couture boutiques. While unvisited, adjacent to the mall is the Lotte World theme park."
28,4.0,"We accidentally came across this mall. A mall is a mall, so nothing special about the shops. However, the basement where the supermarket is located, there were heaps of food stalls. It was food galore for us. Koreans delights and great food for lunch!"
29,5.0,"Awesome vista point. You can see for miles. The elevators are incredibly fast, and you reach the top in no time. Your ears my pop because it's so high. Once up top, you have an awesome view of everything. They have a glass floor on the edges that you can see through allllll the way to the bottom. Super scary if you're scared of heights. Cool place to visit."
30,5.0,"For one thing, it was so quick to get inside and to the top of the tower. At the top, views are 360 and you can stay as long as you like. Couple of coffee shops but we came down to enjoy the Mall afterwards. Both fantastic with the choice you'd expect in Seoul."
31,5.0,"There is an expression, “You’ll know it when you see it”.  It could also be said, “You’ll know it when you feel it”.  From the second we entered the Lotte World Tower, a sensation came over me as I looked up at the endless high ceiling.  Before I go any further let me state, for you to truly experience this magnificent hotel you should have the option to experience the elements of surprise.    Therefore, I will present only basic facts enough to peak your interest without giving away all the unique features you will experience. If you were to google a map of Seoul the most obvious feature you will notice is a building towering above all other structures.  The Lotte World Tower is the tallest building in South Korea, reaching 123 floors at a height of 1,819 feet.  It is the fifth tallest building in the world. Just for the record, our room number was 9882! That is correct the 98th Floor!  The view was breathtaking and certainly the highest floor we have had the pleasure of staying for the night. The hotel is connected to the Lotte World Mall. The Mall is exceptionally large, modern and beautiful offering a host of famous brand names with numerous places to eat with a variety of delicacies from around the world.  In the basement of the hotel is an outstanding Aquarium truly worth visiting.  Their specious lounge, is a place we frequently visited to relax and enjoy the panoramic view of the city located on the 79th floor.  There is an outstanding observation deck located on the 123-floor overlooking the city. From our room we could see the river that was incredible especially when watching the city lights at night. The hotel of course offers all the amenities found only in the top luxury hotels. Wait until you see your uniquely designed room especially the bathroom!  I highly recommend you take advantage of their outstanding breakfast.  Everything is fresh and with a variety of choices that are professionally served.  My suggestion is order their smoothie, the combinations of taste is exceptionally delicious.  Of all the highlights offered by any hotel it always comes down to the quality of service by the staff. Having travelled around the world the personnel at the Signiel hotel we would rate above outstanding. Their kindness and efficiency is second to none and they make you feel right at home. We consider the whole complex a “City within a city”. Seoul has hundreds of top end hotels to choose from but, if you want to truly experience something from a fancy world, the choice is obvious. It certainly captured our hearts the moment the doors were open.  On a personal note, when visiting a new hotel, I always make a concretive effort to try and find flaws.  Paying particularly attention to the smallest details to challenge their efforts to put their best foot forward. I can honestly say without hesitation; this hotel is truly a Perfect 10!"
32,5.0,Absolutely my favourite place in Seoul. Very nice area and the Mall beside is amazing. I miss this place! View Sublime!
33,5.0,"The Lotto tower is a must to visit.You feel as a little thump when you are near the towerThe area around the tower will also surprise you, so you will find the van Gogh bar, you will see the wealth in the special shops.People will arive bij car and chauffeur to do their shoppingOh yes you can also to the top of the tower to enjoy the view over the town"
34,5.0,supper mall if you are in Seoul this is something you need to do and go to the top the rest you will figure out
35,4.0,"We traveled over to this side of town strictly to go up the tower and see the city. We went up in the afternoon and there was no wait at all. The elevators were really cool! View at the top was nice and the windows were clean (a pet peeve of mine when taking pictures).   There is an area that you can stand over a glass floor, which doesn't have any additional cost. We walked around the mall afterward, which had some cool stores and places to get a snack."
36,4.0,"Quite a distance from mid town, and the entrance fee was $28 for an adult.  We saw the sunset and the night view, very nice.  The final stop was the restaurant which we didn't know until we got up there.  You wont be able to see anything unless you order.  So we left.  I wish we didn't have to go up to that floor.  The floors below had marvelous view already."
37,5.0,This is amazing. It is a place for all.Centre for shopping  and dining . Also best place for kids and there is full division of game zone. Aquarium is worth going.
38,5.0,"I love skyscrapers, so this one was a must. Very impressive when you first lay eyes on it. Plenty of shops in the mall, and plenty to do around it too. Go to the Seoul Sky (117th floor I think) or have a drink at the hotel (81st floor bar of Signiel hotel), amazing!"
39,2.0,"We went here expecting to spend a few hours or so here, but with the smoking and dirt every where we did not stay long.Things were also not good quality or cheaper than at home in Australia."
40,4.0,"This is one of the tallest towers in the world, so we decided to pay the exorbitant entrance fee to see it for ourselves. You can pay by cash or by credit. After you pay your entrance fee you are taken to the lifts which take you to the observation platforms. The lift in itself is a bit of an experience – there are screens on all the walls and the ceiling which display a short show about the tower while you are riding up.The towers are impressively tall, and from that distance you lose perspective of how high up you actually are. There are several observation deck levels, and each deck has something different on offer. There is a level that has a couple of glass floor areas where you can look down to the street below (that's a bit freaky at first!), there's a level where you can go to a balcony area, there is a cafe and when we were there there were displays commemorating the winter Olympics and some statues of the Olympic mascots that you could have photos with.We got there at sunset, which was really nice. We stayed for long enough to see the sun go down and the lights of the city come on. We were there for about an hour all up."
41,3.0,"If you want high-end good, this is the place. Otherwise, skip it as this mall is nothing special and is devoid of any character. Limited dining options too. Coex is a better choice."
42,5.0,"The Lotte Tower Seoul Sky observatory should certainly be listed as one of the highlights of a visit to Seoul.   The views, especially of the Han River, at sunset, and just after sunset are breathtaking.  You can also see the Olympic Park very well.  Admission at 27,000 won is reasonable compared to other World Class towers.   There was no wait when we visited on at 6 pm Monday evening.  The surrounding area is also of interest, for example Lotte World.     There was a haze but it wasn't too bad.   Seoul is a fascinating mix of its ancient civilization, the devastation and its unflinching remembrance of its bitter first half of the 20th Century, and the current relentless vitality, affluence and modernity of today.   Along with the frenetic shopping districts, the Lotte Tower is an iconic symbol of the latter. Don't miss it !"
43,3.0,"Busy but interesting food court with many varieties of Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese foods. The prices are amazing, with basic sneakers going for around $250 and above. OK for browsing, but don't buy!"
44,5.0,"You could easily spend a full day in the mall itself. The tower is amazing and definitely worth a visit. Even if you have an hour or so free time, I’d recommend a visit just to see it."
45,5.0,"The Tower was finished 2016 and has a beautiful architecture inside and outside. If you want to get an Impression of Seoul and the development of the city after the civil war go there. With 555 m it is as far as height is concerned building number 5 in the world. You can go up to 486 m with the elevator. From this floor you have a perfect view of the Olympic area right below you, the skyline and the river. For us it was the number one sight in Seoul."
46,4.0,"This is the tallest in Korea and 5th in the world. It was a sunny day and the view was great. You have to pay 27,000 won as entrance fee and it’s worth it. They have a cafe and a souvenir shop at the 121st flr. Still worth a visit."
47,4.0,One of the tallest buildings in the world. Was interesting to look around the shopping centre and then go up the tower. There is also a theme park and numerous restaurants.Worth a visit.
48,5.0,"We took the trip to the top of the tower on a reasonably clear day,  and could see for about 15 kms max.,  but enough to experience the panorama that is Seoul.  The elevator in itself is a memorable experience,  and on a whole is well managed and arranged.  Definitely worth doing.  Book online in advance if it's a busy time of the year,  and with the Seoul Visitors map there is a discount for the ticket pricer (see ad on the map available from Tourist Info)"
49,5.0,"It's -by far- the highest building in Seoul and one of the highest in the world.For a sky-scrapers lover, it really worth a visit. There is a hotel on the top of the building, so, the best way to enjoy the view is, while drinking your drink at the bar of the hotel."
50,5.0,Fantastic views over the city and beyond.Go at sunset and have a beer on the 123rd floor.Wonderful.
51,5.0,"We visited the tower on a weekday evening and there was no crowd at all.  I guess it was the absence of tourists that made the entire visit so pleasant. The view at sunset seems to be one of the better time to visit too, as the sun set the building and street lamps came on. Simply spectacular."
52,4.0,"This shopping mall is new, in connection of the Lotte skyscraper in Jamsil. The most surprising finding was the DIY juice place on the second floor worthwhile to test."
53,5.0,I loved this mall! We spent an entire day there. There were two different sections. One had more high-end shops like Chanel while the other part had more affordable stores like Uniqlo. There were also lots of great food options. The only downside is that there are long lines for all of the restaurants. We had to wait 45 minute to be seated for dinner.
54,5.0,"I went just to see the tallest building in Asia.  I was gasping with joy as i experienced several floors, especially the see through glass floor.  They did a wonderful job of creating different experience by integrating tech media.  I didn't get to try yet but i heard their food somewhere in the middle of the tower is very good too.  I will definitely try the restaurant when i go back."
55,4.0,"There are too many people in this  area. The mall is divided into luxury brand section and non-luxury brand section and basement restaurants are connected for hundreds of yards.This place has Lotte theme park, subway station, Lotte Hotel, mall, and business district all connected into one place. It is a megs shopping district. On the 6th floor there is a movie theater."
56,4.0,Located close to lotte world park. this area is full of LOTTE building and malls. big mall mostly expensive products. beautiful mall. good restaurant. you can visit this place after lotte world park.
57,4.0,"At the time of review, this is South Korea's tallest building and the world's 5th tallest building at 555m and 123 floors. Naturally, one would not want to miss out on an opportunity to stand at its observation deck on one of the top floors, and it is with this determination that I have to part with a fairly hefty KRW 27,000 entrance fees. The top draw in the observation deck is undisputedly the glass bottom which truly tests your fear for heights and is not for the faint-hearted. The 360 degrees view from the top is spectacular but only if the weather is permitting. The Lotte World Tower is attached to a modern shopping mall and an aquarium which will easily occupy your 1-day itinerary. Make no mistake, this towering skyscraper is the epitome of Seoul's push towards modernity!"
58,5.0,"Lotte Tower can be found outside the Jamil Station that is also close to Lotte World amusement park.  After buying the tickets, there is a short walk through a security check then into rooms and corridors that have great video and pictures on the walls and sometimes on the ceilings.  The elevator/lift is rapid and also has a video display on the upper walls and ceilings.  The view from the tower is spectacular even on a misty day like the day we went, There are more levels to go up and a small cafe that sells mostly ice creams.  A great place to visit, if you have the time for some spectacular sights of Seoul and would be good around twilight."
59,5.0,downstairs is the aquarium. great shopping in the mall with lots of places to eat. make sure you go to the observatory at the very top for spectacular views of Seoul !!
