There are many shops selling typical stuff in a mall - clothes, shoes, bags, cosmetics, fashion wear, accessories, souvenirs etc. Expect the crowd especially in the evenings. One benefit of shopping underground is to enjoy the air con and avoid the sun, rain or cold above ground."

They can speak english enough to get the trade.Items are cheaper here compared to the Myeongdong Shopping Street.A lot of stuff to choose from. but sometimes some get sold out.Don't forget to bring your shopping bag because most likely you'll gonna buy a lot of things.Very accessible by subway. Use the Subway App."
4,3.0,"A lot of noise made about this place by some foreginers like me and visiting there was a must but I was more than disappointed. Nothing much but some poor quality goods from souvenirs to clothing, bags etc. If you're looking for quality goods, don't bother because you are not likely to get any"
