0,5.0,Very fun place! Both our kids (4 & 9) had a lot of fun taking pictures and exploring the digestive system.The location at TripAdvisor is wrong. It is about 250 to the south at the SM duty free Mall next to running man!
1,5.0,"We visited on the 25 Jul 19.  It’s in a high rise building on one of the floors, it’s signposted everywhere so very easy to find.  To get there take line 1 subway from Janggak station exit 3, it’s a three min walk from there. Prices W7,000 each.  The children get a quiz sheet with they can fill in all the way round which they loved. What we enjoyed about this attraction was that every room was a different room which explained the digestive tract, until you get to the poop.  There were rooms with bouncy balls, intestines which were like bouncy castle walls That you had to squeeze through. Once you get to the end you can go through a door to do it all again, you don’t feel rushed to leave. My children did the circuit 3 times.  They also give you coins that you can throw in a poop wishing well at the end, google translate had us giggling at our fortune.  I would say it’s an interesting hour of fun tops, not the three hrs advertised but It was a good, I would recommend. When you purchase your ticket you can buy a package to enter the running man next door. This looked fun but the queue was massive and it was very energetic, one of our party was sporting a leg injury so we couldn’t participate but we could hear loads of giggles. I would recommend!"

But we were here for running man, and poopoo land right beside running man is a great complement.This deals with the unique experience of anything to do with the word ""poo"". This is actually another version of those trick eye museums but exclusively for the poo."
3,4.0,"We came over here from Dragon Hill Lodge with our 13, 7 and 5 year old. It’s very much appropriate for little ones as my 13 year old just giggled about it the whole time. Only takes about 20 min to complete but you can complete the trip again. Lots of places to take silly pictures!"
4,5.0,"Me and my family just went today. My family thinks farts are funny, so we really got a kick out of this. All the photo opp's are great for Facebook, when we get back home!"
5,3.0,"Not sure on how to initially react when I saw this place. It was odd but fun for young kids especially when eveything your child say is “poop”... hahaha! This place was hard to find, I saw it while I was walking around Insadong. The entrance is not bad, the inside is full of rubber poop in different colors and toilet seats. Price $6."
6,3.0,"I think part of the allure of this attraction is that it's not readily visible. It's in a little shopping plaza off the main (on weekends) pedestrian zone, and even once found, it takes a little bit of time to be sure that it's the right place (To be fair: I speak/read only a little of the language. There might have been big signs saying ""PooPoo Land this way"" for all I know....).It's great for kids and adults who still giggle at farts. There are a lot of stations for funny poop/fart/toilet photos. It's not huge--- if we would have known, we probably would have taken a little more time at each station.  Also, once inside, the only easily-skipped thing is the slide. I only mention this because I crawled through the ""digestive tract"" features while carrying my coat, my kids' sweatshirts, a camera, my purse, and a few bags we collected while shopping on the way....that was a mistake. Travel light.All in all, it was a fun, silly, probably-one-time thing. I don't see myself rushing for a repeat visit, but we all had a good laugh and got some great pics and memories!"
7,4.0,"I think that Poo Poo Land is really funny place, but if you want to go slowly and have fun go there early. Because small kids can be little bit dangerous and tiresome.Poo poo Land jest naprawde śmiesznym miejscem, ale trzeba tam iść rano."
8,3.0,"Enjoyable place for kids. In fact it is quite narrow inside, difficult to move, especially when crowded. However, kids are enjoying. Location is easy to access. Entrance fee should be much less in my opinion, as there is nothing special in terms of fine arts or history, compared with so many and cheap museums in Seoul."
9,4.0,"My girlfriend and I visited this for fun and we had a blast. It was fairly cheap and pretty short, but all the sounds and ""art"" was hilarious. The real negative was that everything was in Korean, so any info/signs I couldn't read. Great for a little stop by though!"
