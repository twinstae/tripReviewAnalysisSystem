0,5.0,A superb show filled traditional rhythms of Korean cultural drumming and a brilliant nonverbal comedic performance! Great incorporation of the audience in every act! A must-see during your first visit to Seoul!
1,5.0,We went to the evening show which started at 8pm and it was absolutely amazing. One of the best thing we have done in Seoul. We would reccommend everyone to go but make sure you book tickets in advance. Enjoy.
2,5.0,"I was quite sceptical at first, although reading lots of good reviews about the show. I was thinking it would be comical and stuff youâ€™d see on TV, but this was by far the most hilarious thing Iâ€™ve watched. In fact Iâ€™ve never seen my 69 year old mum laugh like that for the longest time and my wife was literally in tears with a little headache from all the laughing.We got the slot which was performed by the blue team who were full of energy, very skilful and very talented. Donâ€™t want to give too much away, but would definitely recommend it to anyone of any age to check this show out if theyâ€™re visiting Seoul."
3,5.0,"One of my best experiences in Seoul! I booked the ticket online 1 week before the show, and the ticket was ready at the counter when I went 10 minutes before it started.It is a funny show. And the energy of dancing and drumming and jumping and chopping for almost 2 hours- wow!!! The cast worked really hard and I mean really hard to give a good show.And getting the audience involved made it more fun. I love all the characters!!!I highly recommend itðŸ˜˜"
4,3.0,It is real entertainment and the show is good to follow even when you donâ€™t understand what they are saying. Only thing I didnâ€™t like was the less interactive with the crowd at the row above the theater.
5,5.0,Very good performers with a funny story that involve the audience. There is no problem if you didn't speak Korean.
6,5.0,"If you havent seen this show, you must go watch it!Their website has early bird discount for those interested. Show is hillarious. Drumming and some simple english really make this work. The skills of each individual performer is amazing. Food flying to the audience, korean drumming, audience participation included."
7,1.0,I am sure it would have been a fun show to see... if they honored their cancelation / change policy. We ran into flight issues ahead of time and requested change to a later date (we didn't want to cancel). Their Web site gave errors trying to cancel / change (convenient for them) and my e-mails were ignored. VIP tickets lost.
8,5.0,"Loved it! My girlfriend had no idea what this show was about going in but I told her we had to watch it while we are here in Seoul. It was hilarious! My favorite character was the boss, his facial expressions and hand gestures are hilarious. I can't find a single thing that I didn't like about the show. I liked how I was able to bring in a snack during the show as well :) The staff is very adamant about recordings and I would be too because these actors work very hard and want their guests to experience it the right way, plus, the show is VERY affordable! Any seat in the theater is great BUT beware the ones sitting in front might participate in the show, which is actually a good thing because they are very friendly and the audience is of course supportive. Have a great time and dont worry if you dont speak korean, the show does not have dialogue! Comedy is a universal language :)"
9,5.0,"I had no idea what to expect and I was crying laughing. The actors are great, really engaging and high energy. There is audience participation which is always unpredictable and in our show, really funny. I was really nervous when they were working with knives and fire. Go with an open mind and enjoy. The area of the theater is very lively so plan to also walk around and get some food or drink. If you don't want to part of the audience participation, don't buy a ticket near the isle! There is no intermission but it goes quick. Pick up the ticket down a few flights of stairs (no lift). There is a bathroom. You can bring your own refreshments into the theater. No pictures or video."
