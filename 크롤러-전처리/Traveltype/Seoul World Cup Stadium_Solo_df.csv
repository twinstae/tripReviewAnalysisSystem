But that wouldn't bother much as there're more much interactive VR experience game that you can try! Staff was helpful and spoke good English so he took me to every zone to try the games out!Then off to a FC Seoul game in the afternoon on the same day. Atmosphere outside and around was great, despite the team was underperforming. There's also a fan shop and fan cafe to visit too!"
1,4.0,"South Korea and Japan jointly held the FIFA World Cup football tournament in 2002. The World Cup Stadium in Seoul was built for that tournament. It is shaped like a traditional Korean kite. When viewed from above, it looks like a rectangular shield that is being flown like a kite. It is said that the shape of the stadium represents the flight towards victory. It also combines the hopes of the World Cup games and spirit and traditional culture of the Korean people. South Korea did very well in the tournament and reached the semi finals when they were knocked out by Germany. South Korea did well to knock out Italy in the round of 16 and Spain in the quarter finals. The stadium is a 60,000 seater stadium. It is a very large stadium. There are also large screens on either side of the stadium for people wanting close-up view of the games. There are a variety of parks near the stadium. There are also five theme parks around the stadium including Peace Park, Nanjicheon Park and Noeul Park. There are many beautiful trees - and together with the modern street lights, and lovely fountains - gives you a very attractive place to stroll about. The stadium is open from 9am to 5 pmThere is a World Cup museum (Faentasium) as well. The stadium now has a department store."

I ended up in another park (the World Cup Stadium and Park comprises several parks), It's a nice place for taking a walk or biking with family and friends.The stadium was closed when I visited. Next time I'll go, it's because I'm watching a game."
3,4.0,"Yes!I was here watching Seoul FC vs Suwon Bluewings FC in this historical former world cup stadium.Having a good football match, friendly-passionate-cheerful supporters, well-managed area, and easy to reach.Felt the vibe of the passionate supporters on my way to the stadium; young-old, man-woman altogether wearing their lovely Red-Black jersey supporting FC Seoul.The Suwon supporters did also.The access to the stadium is easy, you can get subway train or bus.Snacks & drinks were sold in certain booths as well as merchandise items.I got one..yeah!Toilets are available, need to bring your own tissue for backup, during the events."
4,4.0,"There were no matches on as I went in the middle of winter meaning a lot of the area was closed. The videos were not playing in the museum and I was pretty much the only person there. However, the opportunity to see such a stadium and read about the history for the small price (about 50p, GBP) was massively worth it. I got to stand in the stadium completely alone looking at the pitch and stands, which for a football nerd like me was a beautiful experience. I also got to see the changing rooms, press rooms and the non interactive parts of the museum. Overall well worth a visit, and either in summer for the exhibits or winter for the serene experience."
