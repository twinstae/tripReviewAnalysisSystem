0,3.0,While the university itself might not have a lot going on.  But it's near the shopping street so a lot of bargains to be found and a lot of people and energy. Located at Hongik university station.  Walk around and soak it up
1,5.0,Very crowded due to the university...many shops and cheap...of course many coffee shops .... After 6.00 pm it's completely different..you can see someone sings
2,3.0,"+ Location  (Youthful, lively a lot of shopping and clubbing)+ A lot of art close to the university- Boring groundsBasically everything inside the university itself is boring (unless you're a student), outside of it it's great."
3,4.0,"With many university students passing through, the area is known for its youthful culture and atmosphere - at night there are many clubs and nightlife which one can enjoy. In comparison to Myeong-dong, the night markets are smaller - but sell similar things, like accessories and fashion. There are some very nice cafes around - even a Hello Kitty themed one."
4,5.0,"One can see many art projects and if you want to study somewhere but don't want to pay for an expensive coffee, there are several study halls that people can use.  Technically they are for Hongik University students only but there is no one checking id."
