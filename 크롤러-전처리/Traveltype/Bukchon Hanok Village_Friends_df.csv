0,4.0,This area is so beautiful. Perfect for taking loads of pictures while wearing hanbok. The only thing is you need to keep quiet and do not make loud noice as there are people still living in it. Please respect the locals.
1,4.0,"I first got so lost trying to find a certain restaurant (turns out it was closed), but once you let go and just wander wherever you want, you'll be fine. Walkable distance from the Gyeongbukgong Palace. Lots of cute traditional shops and cool eateries. Be prepared to trek up and down the hills. Be respectful of people's homes of course."
2,4.0,Often people come to hanok village to see the houses... But there's more to see. Hike up to the vilage and be amaze by the view!
3,4.0,We can rent hanbok for an hour before taking a walk. The area is residential area so we need to walk quietly to not bother the residents.
4,4.0,"I went up to Hanok village with a couple of friends, prompted by Trip Advisor’s recommendation. I would say i found it to be slightly less glamorous than in the pictures one finds online. And also it’s not big. Like 3 blocks. One has to be super quiet while walking up those streets; there are signs everywhere mentioning that. It is also very crowded with tourists; people who are having an entire photoshoot in the middle of the street. The Bukchon observatory is underwhelming: just a tall house towering over the others. One last thing: if you are tired of walking already or are having back/hip issues (like i did today), you will find this climb up those streets challenging. I was in pain and it wasn’t fun."
5,4.0,"The traditional village of the Korean old house. Beautiful place for photo and can feel the life of their old way. The new experience to be felt. During winter the weather was cool, quite difficult for us to explore the village. Other seasons must be more Nice"
6,5.0,"Great place to take photos, come early to avoid the crowd. Hanbok rentals are available at the entrance, but the ones below the street are cheaper."
7,5.0,"Korean traditional residence Village.I Only have 5 minute to take some picture and explore in the mean street only. I need more time to explore it. Keep quite and take a picture in every corner..... do not make sound. Just enjoy the ambiance. Better go to this place in the morning, or your first destination before crowd  coming. so you will have a clean area to pose. I give you examples..."
8,3.0,This traditional Korean village is beautiful but is somewhat destroyed by inconsiderate tourists who talk loudly and make too much noise in a residential area. Pity.
9,4.0,Good to see and enjoy the walk with many house in its original architecture. There are also some souvenir shops and coffee to stop by.
10,4.0,"The hanok is a type of housing once popular in Seoul, in this cillage you can get a glimpse of the past architectural wonders of Korea."
11,5.0,Although I did not stay very long at this place I really enjoyed going there.  I like the contrast of these old Korean traditional houses with the Seoul building.  if you are looking good you can find cute little cafe and have quieter places where everyone gathered to make pictures in hanbok.  I recommend this place by staying there for several hours does not really interest.  thought to also respect the tranquility of the inhabitants (the houses are not empty but well inhabited).
12,4.0,"Just behind where we are living (itself in Bukchon).  The village is very pleasant.  While we were there, the place had tourists who, except for one, maintained the pleasant quiet of the neighborhood and the respect for its residents.Because it was a Tuesday, the “museums” we wanted to see were closed.  However, just walking around and seeing the old buildings , which are juxtaposed against new magnificent villas, was a pleasure.The prospective visitors should be warned of the topology: it is inevitable that you will climb and descend some steep inclines; sometimes using steps and sometimes without. Tiring but definitely worth the effort."
13,4.0,"Its a long alley filled with Korean traditional houses. It just gets crowded with tourists. As i know, there are still people living in them so visitors are discouraged to make too much noise. I didnt go walk further because there were too many people."
14,5.0,"We visited as part of our Seoul full day tour. Stunning houses and streets. If you visit you need to be quiet. The residents love their little community, but it is popular with tourists as it's so stuuning."
15,4.0,"This village is an area in the city center of Seoul very famous because you can find there the traditional houses, where nowadays people live. Actually I expected them to be more authentic, but in fact those houses have been renewed and they have just tha appeal of a traditional building! I went there on a Saturday afternoon and in the streets there was also a handmade market with lot of jewellery and artisanal products. The place is also full of bar and cafes where you can have a break dipped into this tipical atmosphere."

18,5.0,We did a tour here of the village. I loved it. It's a beautiful historic site with lots of interesting history and it has been apart of different KDramas. Lots of walking but worth the trip.

20,4.0,"Good to visit the place and see the traditional houses.Try to find EGG DROP sandwiches, they sell really good sanwiches. It was very sunny in summer, so pls bring your necesseties. I think qinter is the best time to visit the place. Bec we wanted to try thr traditional costume but it is too hot so we have to pass."
21,5.0,"This is a very nice and quiet area of Seoul. Well conserves streets, you can imagine the old Seoul walking among those streets...but is a real neighborhood so be respectful!!!"
22,5.0,"Fascinating area, still inhabited by regular people not just kept as a historical landmark. We stayed at one of the guesthouses in that area. Authentic hanok house. Amazing experience. Highly recommend to anyone. The only downside - streets are never empty, crowds of tourists are everywhere. Unless you wake up really early. Crowds take away some charm from this place."
23,5.0,There are many houses with the traditional Korean architecture. It is worth to wall around. Koreans are respectful and they expect tourists to be respectful too. So it is nice to keep voices down while going around the neighborhood. ;)
24,5.0,Beautiful village with interesting architecture. It’s a residential area so it’s important to be quiet and respectful when walking around. Cute little shops and lovely views.
25,4.0,"It's a nice traditional village that located in a big modern city. Here, you can admire korean traditional architecture through hanok house. There are some cute souvenir shops here. It takes time if you come here for the first time because there are many corners so that you have to explore to looking for nice spot for photos. Be quiet because it's residence area. You can rent hanbok outside and come here to take some great photos. And don't forget to check Baek Je In museum house. You can enter the house. It's really nice"
26,2.0,"It was nothing like in the pictures, and way more smaller. If you come here, you won’t be able to understand what is a traditional Korean village. It looks like it just visited to be the perfect instaspot, but even for that, you’ ve to be in the perfect position, otherwise it’s nothing."
27,4.0,A super place to see some traditional Korean architecture but it can get busy with tourists taking photos. Be sure to get there as early as possible to avoid the lunchtime rush and enjoy the cultural alleyways in peace.
28,4.0,"Try walking around this area maybe around 1pm for you to be able to enjoy every traditional practice they can offer, including weaving, doll/crafts making, paintings, house scents and even food because it all closes at 6pm. They also offer wearing of Hanbok for only 7000KRW in one day.The area is a community, with people living in the old houses so they have these signs which tells you to minimize your noise. But when you walk around, it feels like tradition meets modernization. Roofing of houses are still old but there are newer buildings which conforms to traditional architecture. And try to spot the house of their ""national"" artists (or so i thought) living in the area.The people in the neighborhood are friendly too, they will tell you which way to go and what to do on the area, and there are also Tourism officers dressed in red where you can ask questions."
29,5.0,"if you would like to experience old Korea, I strongly recomend to go Bukchon rather than Insadong. Bukchon is less commerciallization."
30,4.0,Nice place to visit when you are in the area. You can find nice traditional houses but of course you can only take pictures outside since people actually live in them.You need to be quiet too.
31,5.0,A must do when in Seoul.  Make sure to rent a hanbok before walking through this area to have a complete experience. Just make sure to respect the residents of the area and keep your noise at a minimum.

33,5.0,"if you are looking for traditional Korean building, but not a theme park? Bukchon Hanok village is the right place to visit. It is close from palace and samcheongdong. you will see tons of tourist around this area, but you will find out why so many people visit this place when you actually see the place."
34,5.0,Take a walk thru this residential area with beautiful korean style buildings  - whispering is necessary as the residents should not be bothered. it is a steep walk but worth it. At the entrance some nice souvenir shops to visit.
35,4.0,"Bukchon village is actually a private housing estates prized with traditional Hanok houses. Hence, there will be volunteers to ask you to not to make too much noises to avoid disturbing the residences. It is located near the gyeongbukhung and changdeokgung palace grounds and within walking distance from Anguk station. It is just an area with lots of traditional houses where you can rent Hanboks and walk around the area for photo taking. It is a very tiring climb and not recommended for older folks with knee issues. But the hike up is worth is for the magnificent view. We did not pay for the observatory as the view up on the hill was good enough. Worth a visit but only if you are in the area."
36,5.0,It was amazing the way it was built.  Have a hard time walking to the top and we made it. I am impressed with structural design even though the buildings aged with the passing of time.  Great place to visit.
37,2.0,Nothing much to see except some old houses and nice ice cream. Go if you have extra time. I won't go again.
38,5.0,"The area nearby to the palace has some of the traditional Korean housing as well as some interesting shops.  It is a residential area, so visitors are exhorted by signs and uniformed monitors to keep their voices down in respect for the residents.Set in the side of a hill the streets are narrow and winding and there are some cute houses that evoke another time.  Shops include art galleries and unique crafts - a great place to find that special souvenir."

40,3.0,"The houses look great and it's nice to walk around here, but it was absolutely packed with tourists."
41,3.0,"Bukchon Hanok Village is situated in the middle of modern part of the city.  Once you find it, the area is beautiful and you can enjoy a walk through the hillyneighbourhood of traditional Korean houses.  Because the houses are occupied, all you see are the outside.   Below the village, there are restaurants and shops catered for tourist.A 'must' visit attraction in Seoul, no sure."
42,5.0,This place is a good visit with great view and peace Cos the there are residents leaving in those houses.  There’s a nice cafe on the way to the cafe.  Can have it before or after
43,5.0,"This place was great to see such old homes, however some have high tech door bells from Samsung so old meets modern! I would highly suggest visiting here"
44,4.0,"We expected to see something else, so slight disappointment. But many people around with traditional dress for photo shooting, interesting architecture make it enough sexy to take the walk."
45,3.0,"I'm not sure if we went at a bad time, but there were signs posted everywhere about how the people who lived there were suffering from tourists, and asking tourists to stay away for a while. Near the the entrance, it looked like there was some kind of filming going on (for a news station). We entered, but upon seeing the signs, we left, since we didn't want to disturb them."
46,5.0,"A very nice place with steep slope. The area is occupied with residents and offices, good to be there with Hanok to get pretty photos with nice background."
47,5.0,"The place is about 10-15minutes away from the nearest station. If you are lost, there are friendly tourist guides along the way, who can explain how to get there. Be sure to rent any traditional Korean dresses (hanbok) for that Instagram worthy pictures before going up the hill. Because it is a residential area, tourists are adviced to keep quiet and to not make any noises. There are also lots of coffee shops and cafés nearby for people to rest while taking photos"
48,4.0,"Quaint area, love the details of the houses here, and I’m not disappointed with this tour. This time of year is the best time for me, weather is cool, needed to wear jacket. We had a great time, slow paced, totally relaxing tour."
49,3.0,We explored an alley which is famously known for traditional korean house/street. It is located at Bukchon-ro 11-gil street. It has view of namsan tower. We went there around 8pm (weekdays) which less crowd and manage to snap some photos. Just to remember not to make so much noise as the resident might be sleeping. #instagrammableplaceinseoul
50,5.0,"If you're looking for a  place you can stroll around,  this is it.  We were there in mid March, there were no sakura blossoms that time. It could have been perfect scenery with the blossoms.  The village has the old houses but not as many. It's more like a big park that's a bit hilly with sakura trees. Some people  go there for a jog. I recommend this place for those who want to see sakura flowers in April. There might be some event show sometime as I've noticed a stage and benches."
51,5.0,"It is a residential area where you can see old traditional Korean Houses on a hill. Some are more than 500 years old.  Many foreigners rent a Hanbok which is traditional Korean attire and take pictures there. Also, take a picture at the street museum in the urban core. Furthermore, there are many small Korean restaurants and coffee shops in the area...a great place to have lunch.  And a great viewing point"
52,4.0,This has been kept as a heritage place with all sound boards in Korean.Get a local to explain the details.Have tea and time cakes at a traditional tea house.
53,3.0,"If you're going to Bukchon, best to go in the morning because it gets crowded in the afternoon. The streets are quite a climb so its not recommended for those who tire easily."
54,4.0,Interesting to visit the outside of the houses in that village. Quite unique as compared to city dwellings. Reminder of done K drama scenes.
55,4.0,"This is less of a village, but more a collsction of old buildings dotted around with one or two streets where the whole areahas been preserved. There is also a new, reconstruction of a hanok building showing their construction. It's interestng walking around the larger area as it's got some nice little shops, coffee bars and food shops. It's also a large residential areas with noise wardens to keep the tourists no use at wispering level. A great idea as it's people's homes and their local street we're walking through.Well worth a visit."
56,5.0,"The place is easy to reach by using public transport, it is a traditional Korean houses in the middle of Seoul, it nice to see the old Koreans lifestyle, it is best to visit after 10 AM, befor that the shops are closed, there is a small coffee shop serves tea in old traditional way, good thing is that you can rent a Korean custom and walk in the village."
57,4.0,It's an old valley with old houses that's still preserved til now. It's a residential area so the tourist can't make a loud noise but unfortunately some tourists can't understand that and stil make some noises.

60,5.0,Rent a hanbok in here with a very cheap price. It was so nice to got to experienced walking around the 'village' while wearing a hanbok in a beautiful and artistic design of house and shops
61,4.0,"It was super fun to walk the narrow roads past beautiful buildings. Especially in Hanbok, which I highly recommend. It is up and down, so if you have knee problems it can be a little challenging. I had lunch at a great little restaurant and did some traditional sweet shopping. They have these lifesaver type lollies that whistle when you blow or suck through them. Entertaining and well annoying, but fun. I also did a Korean knot tying experience. It is really for beginners and available on a walk in basis. You get to choose from two types of bracelets, a key chain and two types of necklaces. Most of it is done for you, it is just a matter of choosing colours, and tying the macrame type knots. No Korean is needed as most have basic English. It was fun, but too simple for me. You can book a class for the more intricate knot projects. Which I will do next time. Just on the side, you sit on the ground, so with my dicky knees this was a little challenging. Also fun in Hanbok as it puffs out around you when seated."
62,5.0,Experience 600 years of history at this village.  They have a lot of restos and ingenious shops and it's just nice to get lost on the alleys. You would certainly find something nice at any corner.
63,2.0,This Hanok Village is pure tourist attraction without soul. Area consist several street or alleys with mostly new build look like old style buildings. I didn't really see point of this place? BTW. Hanok Village observation place is somebody's home at third floor.
64,5.0,"Being close to the center of Seoul, There are many traditional Korean houses(Hanok). This village is definitely a must-visit Seoul attraction for its unique architecture and the traditional Korean streets.Before the trip, I heard that there would be too many people, which would ruin the scenery. So I chose to visit it before the sun rise and hoped to enjoy the golden hour of photography. There were only several people when I came to it, which save me a lot work when taking photos. Walking down the empty streets, I saw many traditional houses and found many unique features of the houses. Generally, the village is a wonderful place to explore the traditional Korean residence and a instagrammable photo location in Seoul."
65,4.0,"Had a good experience walking and finding for this famous tourist spot. From the Angguk station it takes 15-20 mins to reach this place. Overall, it was a good trip."
66,4.0,"Lots of small shops while making the way up.You can use your google maps and it will lead you there. Great photo opportunity! 15min walk from Anguk Station. In case you get lost, shop owners are kind to show direction"
67,4.0,Visited the Bukchon Hanok village on a cold Friday afternoon. We enjoyed the very pleasant walk through the sands of time. Nice friendly shopkeepers along the way too. We really loved the views of old Seoul juxtaposed against views of modern Seoul in the background. A must see.
68,3.0,"It's a village with actual people living there. There is nothing to do besides taking pictures, and the village is actually pretty little so don't expect to stay here for long."
69,5.0,"Back to old times. Enjoy the ambience of old Korean dynasty, old houses are well maintained and be quiet when roaming around because its a residential area"
70,5.0,"Please feel the traditional beauty of Bukchon Hanok Village, where people still live. And please refrain from any action that interferes with their lives."
71,4.0,"I don’t think have to write long review for this place since Bukchon is one of the most tourist spot in Seoul. Tips from me that you have to come here earlier if want to take many pictures because this place will be very crowded if you came later. Also, please be quiet. There’s some places also not allowed you to take a picture so mind the sign."
72,4.0,"This is a picturesque neighbourhood where a large cluster of privately owned traditional Korean houses has been well preserved for a long period. The village used to be an upscale residential area for wealthy aristocrats and court employees. The traces of old roads and waterways, as well as the stones and timber dwellings, rewind the present to centuries long past. The village has retained it's original shape and feature historical sites and cultural properties that tell the history of Joseon and modern Korea."
73,5.0,"I have visited this area about 5 times. I just love the boutiques, the dining is great. One finds beautiful little stores with wonderful items from great shoes, coats, scarfs to tea and coffee places. In addition the Village delights the visitors with ancestral architecture. I just love this place!"
74,3.0,Here this place for many many korean drama shooting... very famous for everyone... you can see beautiful scenery about palace etc from up up here... you can rent hanbok if you want... with local house that you can use to take photo
75,5.0,.... great to eat stuff but stuff. Look at stuff. There is an amazing traditional woodworking museum round the corner up the hill close to palace. Not on the map but great!!!!!
76,4.0,"This is still a residential area for the locals, so we should respect that and be mindful how 'noisily excitable 'one can be when in throes of wonderment of the beautiful and authentic style of yesteryear homes. These are quite amazing to look at and a good area to get lost in. Unfortunately, precisely because it is a residential area, there are no public facilities ( other than the shops). Good for a half day walking tour."
77,4.0,"If you have the time, make sure to walk through Bukchon Hanok Village. The houses are absolutely beautiful and you feel as though you have been transported to hundred of years ago.While there, also be on the lookout for restaurants serving traditional Korean food. They are the best finds!But please be conscious that there are people living in this area so to please keep your voice low and other noise at a minimum. 😊"
78,3.0,"This was my third trip to Seoul and first visit to the Bukchon Hanok Village.  As I walked through tne neighborhood, I saw the banners of the residents living in the area and felt a great deal of sympathy toward them.  I felt like an intruder!  We did visit one restored mansion in the area.  A lot of the shops and small galleries were closed for lunch time.  While it was picturesque to see many tourists dressed in hanbok, I felt I did not have a deep cultural experience."
79,5.0,"Very nice place for photos of Seoul, definitely recommended this place for soaking in the Korea atmosphere here. There is also shops for u to rent the traditional korean gown to take photos around with quality gown and cheap price. MUST NOT MISS!"
80,5.0,"My friends and I visited Bukchon Hanok Village last year. The place is so picturesque. Of course by wearing the Korean traditional hanbok,  we can blend in with area well 😊"
81,5.0,Village that is picture perfect. Careful that you should be a little quiet while entering this premises because there are actually residentials living there.
82,3.0,A good place to take pictures but mainly along a few alley and a main. Saw a couple taking a wedding shot there. Keep quite as the locals dislike the noise tourist makes.
83,4.0,"When we visited there were many buses taking student on trips here. So it’s a good place to learn about Korean culture and way of living in the past, because it’s even popular among the locals. A drama was being filmed at the village, there aren’t many tourists (few) according to our guide tourists visit the Palace more. I only didn’t enjoy the equestrian show - I don’t like shows with animals in it (personal opinion). But the farmers drums and dance was good."
84,4.0,Wearing hanbok and  taking  pics here bring you to the olden days . Although this place is  not huge. If you want to have a whole town with this kind of building.  Do go to jeongju
85,4.0,"Actually, once you have exit from Anguk station exit 3, it is consider bukchon hanok village. This is what the nice local mobile volunteers told us & gave us a map. Nice scenery but a bit taxing on your legs, especially if you have been walking for the past 5 days as there are a lot of uphills & downhills. Very hard to spot the photo op as per recommended. It would be great if they could put up a sign to mention this spot is for photo! Sigh"
86,4.0,"We stayed in a guesthouse in the village, so had the opportunity to wander the streets both at night and during the day. Lovely traditional old houses and craft experiences and many many coffee shops! It is primarily still a residential area and the majority of visitors were being respectful and keeping the noise down, although you can see why some residents are less welcoming to tourists! For the best photos, you need to be there early in the morning (before 10)."
87,4.0,"The village is located about 10-15 min walk from Anguk station. The station itself is one of the most artistic station I have ever visited in Seoul. I must say that the village is a good place to get to know Korean heritage through its traditional houses (you must know that some people still live inside those houses). There is this one house that you can enter so that you can experience living like a Korean. For those who loves learning about different culture, this is the place to be !"
88,5.0,"When I was here, I felt like I traveled back in time. The village is very homey too. There are nice like shops and I get to wear a Hanbok."
89,3.0,Nothing much to explore here imo as everywhere sells basically the same things. All you could do there is to take pictures and enjoy the building styles?
90,4.0,"This is a lovely place to reflect on the past while respectfully walking the streets. As this is a residential area, it is very important to remain respectful and quiet while visiting their neighborhood.Near the neighborhood are little shops and stops where you can look for souvenirs or grab a bite to eat."
91,5.0,This seems to be the only place where you can get a sense of tradition now that Insadong has been ruined. We wandered the alleys looking at the beautiful buildings. There are buildings you can visit and nice places to stop for tea. A must see.
92,4.0,"A place for old korean houses. You'll have to walk the stiff hill just to get to the top. However this place have restricted tourist from entering already because homeowners no longer want their village to be disturbed. So no longer interesting, but below the place/village there are still some restos & shops"
93,5.0,It’s a definite must on your trip to Seoul. Please be respectful and quite as it is a neighbourhood. We rented costumes and it was hot so we sweated the whole time. But it made a few memorable photos.
94,5.0,It's amazing how they managed to keep the traditional houses. It's like you have traveled back in time. What's even better is if you are wearing a hanbok. You will truly belong.
95,5.0,"This is an area where people live in. Nothing commercial hence respect the neighbours when visiting. Shhhhhhh... there are, somehow, a lot of rude tourists who would chat loudly and walk in to people’s homes."
96,4.0,"We visited during the cool autumn weather . We walked through the traditional village wearing their traditional Korean costume . With all the awesome backdrop for the photos , it was an awesome experience!"
97,5.0,This is a must visit place for someone visiting the city. Beautiful traditional architecture where you can probably shoot one of the best photos in the city. Don't forget to stay quiet as this is a residential area!
98,5.0,"Very interesting original buildings demonstrating the history and architecture, if you really look in detail some amazing artisan drawings and local needlework can be purchased"
99,4.0,Good for educational and sightseeing and photo ops purposes. Gives you ancient koreanovela feels if you watch K-dramas.
100,4.0,"How about seeing an old village in the busy heart of Seoul? Interesting, isnt? I was really happy to find a place like this because, even though Seoul is an economic power, Koreans still preserve a little piece of their heritage in a their very advance and modern metropolis."
101,4.0,The place is quaint and easy to navigate. It is a brilliant idea to preserve the village! Many shops and cafes around too.
102,5.0,"I loved the village, got to see abit of history , long walk around the village, need a map to get around, but will definately go back again."
103,4.0,"Bukchon Hanok Village is a traditional residential, Most popular tourist spot in Seoul, most of them very well maintained, very nice place visit. do respect the residents there and enjoy the place in a quiet manner ☺️"
104,4.0,What a beautiful place but must be ready to walk.  Also a must visit if you want to feel the history of Korea.  Beautiful old buildings and you can envision the Josean Dynasty time.  We travelled in the beginning of Summer but it was still memorable.
105,4.0,A good place for having a feel of what old Korea is like. Authentic food and beverage also served here along with souvenirs galore. All ages welcome
106,3.0,Only good if you like taking pictures with traditional Korean houses. I felt it was too intrusive as there were noisy tourists everywhere even though the signs say “Please Be Quiet”. A quaint little area but pushed slightly beyond my comfort area.
107,4.0,"This is a popular scenic spot in Seoul. It is famous for the Korean traditional houses and streets. Many tourists are here experiencing the traditional Korean costumes. It is ironic that you can see a lot of angry banners reading “no more tourists, we are suffering from noise” from the local residents while tourists still take photos and chat loudly around."
108,3.0,"This is a a place with nice buildings and architecture, but as it is also a residential area, the residents were not happy with tourists visiting this place and had banners and signs put up saying they dont welcome tourists. There were also signs to say we have to speak softly. There were guides nearer to the main street, you can get a map from them to aid in your walking"
109,5.0,"Hanbok rental can be a bit more pricey than at the Palace around 10,000krw for 1 hour, however, It’s better for pictures here and you wont have to do much photoshop to cut out strangers from your photo :D go there around 9am, no one and no tour is there yet! Btw, keep the noise at the lowest level please, I did feel really bad for those people who lived there since there were a lot of tourists around after 11am."
110,3.0,One of the tourist attractions that offer Korean culture. Many historic old buildings of Korean cultural heritage sometimes have art performances here.
111,5.0,"Step back into time, the architecture in this village is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen.  The streets are a little bit hilly so I don't recommend going here in the summer like I did, it was super hot."
112,2.0,"I expected more, but wandering through the streets it wasn’t very impressive and definitely not a must see for me."
113,5.0,"Seoul is a cosmopolitan city where you can still see traditional buildings. You just need to be able to manage some streets with incline. Since the area is a residential one, tourists need to respect the privacy of the residents. It’s a good place to take pics of the facades of traditional houses."
114,3.0,"First, you should get a map from the tourist info guides (wearing red t-shirts) and follow the recommended path. Don't rely on Google Maps as it will lead you to the wrong place.While visiting this area remember that this is a residential area. Enjoy the area quietly and respectful towards the residents."
115,5.0,"I was amazed by this place, because it was preserved by the community/the people living on this village. It was a nice experienced roaming around with the Korean Traditional costume."
116,3.0,"Went on a late afternoon on a cold  day. Very hilly be prepared to walk. Enjoyed it though, will coming back."
117,3.0,Went early morning with a friend of mine and the place is already packed with tourists with millions of selfie sticks. There are a number of quieter streets to walk around and there are also houses that converted part of their living room to a cafe. I recommend spending sometime at the home style cafes to get a feel of the interior. There are also people with information walking around (they can speak different languages to accommodate the tourists) and it is a good idea to get a map off them so that you know where to go. The streets are very narrow and be sure to stay quiet for the residents.
118,4.0,It was an interesting walk to see the different types of traditional Korean houses.  Would love to walk around more had it not for the hot sun that my friends could not take the heat.
119,3.0,"We were a little lost when we went there because we thought it was a specific place but it turns out it was a whole neighborhood. It is a residential area and has signs everywhere reminding tourists to be quiet. There are many hanbok rental shops around if you want a more authentic experience. We stayed there for only an hour or less since there aren't many things to do aside from taking pictures. My tip is to go there early and find a nice, hidden spot if you don't want pictures where there are a lot of people."
120,4.0,"The hanok houses here have been restored, very lovingly, and have attracted many visitors. These days the people who actually live there are starting to resent the constant stream of tourists gawking at their homes - but it is still worth a visit. Stick to the museums and main street and you will see wonderful examples of Korean architecture."
121,5.0,"You can experience the real Korean narrow, inclined street and so cute traditional house... Such a great place to enjoy the view for photographers and feel the stunning view of sunset over the city... It's must place to visit and feel the taste of up town life... But privacy of Residences is destroyed by tourists and locals... suffer from littering and noises... :("
122,4.0,"An area where the traditional Korean houses still well maintained with lots of them housing residents and/or specialty art craft shops. As it is a resident area, the whole place is serene and peaceful, even though it is near to the main road. It was drizzling when my friend and I visited so made it even less crowded to stroll around."
123,4.0,Instagram for more food and travel @oppakulinerI love this place because you can see how the architecture of korean traditional house through this village. It's like I'm living on the same era that i watched at Korean drama and it's exciting for me
124,4.0,Bukchon Hanok Village is home to traditional wooden houses called Hanok that dates back to the Joseon dynasty.
125,5.0,You can smell the history of South Korea in here. People still live in this village and you have to be quite when you walk around the streets.
126,3.0,"This area is a residential living area, so it is great for photos. Don't expect to find food or shops here. If are looking for that there are a few streets outside of this area for crafts, art, and food."
127,4.0,"Having been to Bukchon village at least 3 times in the past 2 years, my recent trip showed more newly opened cafes and pop up stores. Overall it is still a nice estate to wander in Spring, watching people dressed in Hanboks, sitting in old tea houses, visiting the remodeled traditional houses. For 1st time visitors, you can get a map from the tourist info booth. Coming here by subway is easy too, Anguk station"
128,4.0,There is a nice route for tourist to walk around.Not many of the traditional home open to public.Took us less than one hour to finish the route including photo taking.You do jot need to join a tour if you just want to stroll around.The rental of the traditional costume is just at the beginning of the village.
129,4.0,The place has undergone quite a change as was told by my local guide. As the local find it worthwhile to do preservation of their property even without the support of their government. Thus I do see some construction going on within the neighborhood.
130,5.0,"Fun to wander around and take pictures. The tea houses are really expensive over there, but the village itself is fun to see. There’s some uphill walking but it’s not too bad."
131,3.0,"I had high expectations before the visit but left a bit underwhelmed. There is a suggested trail with 14 stops starting from Bukchon Traditional Cultural Centre. It can be reached from Anguk metro station by foot via Exit No. 3 in less than 350m.I was lost when I arrived so I only started from Point no. 6. There are shops that rent traditional Korean garb, and you’ll likely see many visitors (mostly ladies) wearing them. Photo opportunities along the picturesque paths will depend on the number of tourists. But chances are, it’s going to be a challenge to get a clean shot without others in the background. It was not that crowded with tourists when I visited, but enough to make the place feel cramped.Follow the tourist signs as some of the paths are dead ends leading to residential homes.Be prepared to walk upslope along some of the paths (something most able-bodied visitors should have no problem with, as this is a residential area).At the end of the suggested trail, you can continue walking to Samcheong, where there are eateries, coffee places and souvenir shops.There are also other tourist spots within walking distance, including Insa-dong, Gyeongbokgung Palace and Changdeokgung Palace, etc. Overall, be prepared to spend at least 1-2 hours wandering around."
132,5.0,This is a wonderful place which I haven’t seen in before. The old building and lots of tourists really let this place cheerful. I like it.
133,4.0,A lot of steps up but view was amazing. What was nice was the area surrounding it with small cafes and shops.
134,4.0,This is traditional uptown of Korea located close to Kyungbok palce. Powerful families used to stay in this area in old days and some of the architechs are well maintained still now. You can have rental hanbok and enjoy traditional tea enjoying the atmosphere.
135,3.0,"Thank to good weather it was pleasure to take a walk there, but village itself just bunch of old time building and you cannot get in there"
136,5.0,"A really beautiful place in Seoul to enjoy traditional architecture. There are many cafes and restaurants as well as souvenier shops, so it's a good tourist spot. +you can rent a hanbok to walk around and take cute photos! Recommend!"
137,5.0,I like this place.Its so quiet and the villages we visited was very clean.They even let us use the comfort room.Nice walkway and a lot of shops within the area.
138,5.0,"Got to see how Korean maintain their heritage house. Tourist guide can be found easily in the street and can able speak English, Chinese and Japanese. Some tourist rent Hanbok and take pictures with houses."
139,5.0,The view is fantastic! You get to see a lot of traditional houses and there are a few good traditional restaurant next to the Hanok Village
140,5.0,"This place was part of my check list before arriving in Korea, however due to time constraint and prioritization of sites this was initially deleted. I prioritize museums, after visiting the National Palace Museum, on our way to National Folk Museum we found ourselves walking on the lovely streets of this beautiful village. Rows of well preserved traditional houses, coffee shops, souvenir stores as well as stores offering hanbok rental can be found in the village. The walls that surround the village makes the place more beautiful. It was really like walking down memory lane. I wish I have longer time left to explore the village and to walk in every alley. I only spent 30 minutes here but I was in awed with its charm and beauty. I will surely visit this village again once I return to Seoul."
141,4.0,"We walk here from Gyeongbokgung palace using naver map and also the free map of bukchon provided by the red clothes tourist information were helpful . Some of the houses here have converted to tea house , b&b, etc . It was a steep walk and needs good stamina walking up the hill ."
142,4.0,"Quaint village like area in the heart of Seoul, this is a real residential area and not made up for tourists, lots of little side streets and some are quite steep to walk up. From Anguk station take exit 2 and follow the signs, there are also tourist information people around to ask as well."
143,3.0,"It was kind of disappointed when we finally arrived the village; but it was too late and too dark.  We could not see too much.  We started the day touring the old Sejong Village and the Tongin Traditional Market on the other side of the palace, had late lunch then, walk around top of the Palace to the other side.  We tried several pathways shortcuts into the Bukchon Hanok Village area; but not successful.  Finally we had to walk down further and cut back in.  The better way to the village is from the south end, subway station near the Japanese Embassy."
144,5.0,"The traditional houses at Bukchon Hanok Village is extremely beautiful. There are cultural centers, guesthouses & tea houses at the village providing visitors with an opportunity to experience Korean cultural."
145,3.0,"From the Gyeongbokgung palace, you can just walk about 1-2 km to this village. Please get a map from the information counter. If not, you will lost. You cannot make too much noise because this is a residential area. I don't recommend you to buy souvenirs from this village, it is a bit overpriced."
146,4.0,"Great for photos but other than that, not much to do as it's a residential area with a few converted to galleries or shops."
147,3.0,"A little lost would've been an understatement as my sister and I followed the original Google maps & Naver direction but ended up quite far from where we were meant to be. Whilst lost, we also caught up with another 4 tourists who had the same directions as we did and were completely mistified on how we could've missed a whole village. After 25 minutes, we caught up with a local who advised us to walk down the complete opposite way for another 8 - 10 minutes and we found it as per our map screen shot below.All in good time and only good things come to those who are patient Right? Sure enough we found it along with a Michelin star ginseng chicken soup restaurant. #win."
148,3.0,You can see alot of traditional house of korea in bukchon hanok village. The vibe is good. Remember to keep voices down as there are people living there. Wearing a hanbok to stroll around seems like a good activity.
149,5.0,"Traditional houses, designer shops, houses architecture and nice cafe! Suggestion: Walk around with your hanbok 👘"
150,4.0,Bukchon-ro 12-gil: A Row of Old Korean HousesThe architecture is unique. Glazed roof tiles to protect the house from the bitter winter of Korea and the torrential rains that regularly visits the country during its rainy months. The wooden walls of the main house is to keep the temperature inside as constant as possible.Just by walking down the road where these row houses were built makes one wonder and appreciate at the same time the conceptual design and construction of Korean houses. It is a traditional Korean village with lots of alleys and narrow streets. It was the residential quarters of traditional Korean people and was preserved to show the world a 600 year old urban environment. Tourists as well as amateur and professional photo enthusiasts crisscrossed the street taking as much pictures for posterity and what have you. Visitors experienced the atmosphere of Joseon Dynasty. These houses are simply a sight to behold. Bukchon means “north village.”
151,4.0,Very beautiful and authentic place to visit to see the old traditional houses of the locals. Beautiful designs and very photogenic place especially with some snow on the roof of these houses. Place to visit. 10 mins walk to subway station and palace so can kill 2 birds with a stone.
152,5.0,"i love the architecture of this village, lovely place to take a picture... i love walking and sightseeing here"
153,4.0,"The villege are well build, some foods and shopping along the way. Recommend to walk from Angkuk station along to the Bukchon villege to Kyongbokgung palace. This will consume around 4-6 hours in total (uncluding brief cafe hopping) to see it all around."
154,4.0,Was lucky enough to have a local Korean friend take me walking through this area. Worth the walk to see the traditional architecture and visit the homes.
155,4.0,"Beautiful Hanoks, the street view was very nice. At the time we went, several Hanoks were under construction. It could be more picture perfect."
156,4.0,"I went there with a friend and was amazed by the traditional houses - i mean the whole area was actually filled with those type of houses like those you saw in their dramas. But Its a bit disappointing as it was actually a real residential area and you can only see it from the outside. We manage to go in one of the residence - Baek In Jae House. It was really huge and he even have his own reading pavilion! the house were well kept but...we are not allowed to step in the house, so we just stroll around. But i like the environment tho! Along the narrow road you can find few souvenir shops, but its a bit pricey as it was unique and not like those souvenirs we buy in bulks. Most of the items sold were those made in small quantities and they look very precious and artistic to me. I end up buying their Korean biscuit - unfortunately I forgot the name... Its super yummy!!!!"
157,5.0,"Well preserved and maintained traditional housing village. Rather hilly to walk around but absolutely fascinating place to visit and stay! There are many traditional style inns with modern setup for your convenience where you can even cook your own meals. Many cute stores, where sell handmade jewellery, good quality leather goods and so much more!"
158,3.0,A NICE TO PLACE TO VISIT. has nothing to impress you its just nice. to hang out and see how old days houses and suburban's in Seoul lives. I wouldn't vistt again if I had the chance
159,5.0,If you want to just chill with your friends i do recommend this place. It’s 10 min taxi drive from anguk station. They have very interesting Cousins and cafe with comic books
160,5.0,Absolutely serene neighbourhood with traditional style homes. It's a bit of an uphill climb but worth the view when you get to the top. You'll need to be quiet though as people still live in the village. There are shops + restaurants lining the climb that are also worth visiting.
161,3.0,"Mixed old and new residential buildings, including some of few left traditional Hanoi houses. Many restaurants. Several workshops and one hanok house converted into a museum. Easy to access by metro, a nice one hour walk giving an idea how Seoul looked in old times."
162,3.0,"We took a trip down specially to this village. To be honest there wasn’t much to see except a few streets with some older looking architecture. There’s shops renting hanbok, which adds on slightly to the experience. Wouldn’t recommend a special trip to this place unless architecture and history are your thing."
163,4.0,"I visited Bukchon Hanok Village, with a friend and it was really interesting to see a traditional style village, which is actually still a residential area. Lots of people walking around in Hanbok. Nice observation point where you can have a glimpse of the city."
164,5.0,"Lovely street to stroll around and admire the architecture of the houses. It's also a residential area so it's recommended to not make too much noise. However,  there are a lot of tourists taking the opportunity to take photos in every building which can be annoying. Also, it's very near to Changdeokgung Palace and Samcheong-Dong."
165,4.0,Great place for an afternoon walk. Lots of cafes and what not to stop for break. Very enjoyable with good views
166,3.0,"For me it’s nothing special. Just some small street with old fashioned house. Anyway, it’s quite historical as new building are everywhere in the city. Not a must-go in Seoul."
167,4.0,"Always we seen from TV drama, should drop by to see. Subway can reach. But need a walking distance, about 20 mins. If happen you lost, there is a tourist person. Who dress in red t-shirt & black pant & with a hat. They can guide you to the area.Once you reach ""Bukchon hanok village:, must be quiet . That location still is a  resident area. Of course, you can enjoy the place and houses."
168,3.0,"This place is some neighborhood that full of Korean traditional house. It's full of cafe's and some craft studios. The architectural and structure is amazing, but for you who visit this place just for taking nice photo's you better visit this place in the morning, because it will full with tourist that you will hard to find nice spot to take photo's. And because this place is a neighborhood which is people still live in the house, so you can not walk loudly, and you need to mind the person who live in the house if you want to take photo's in front of their house door."
169,5.0,We really enjoyed touring this village as it had old world charm and showcased the traditional homes and the korean style charming village. It’s a wonderful place for the foreign tourist to get a quick intro to old Korea. We had much fun people watching and enjoyed some traditional hot tea at the tea house. We highly recommend this place as a destination in Seoul.
170,5.0,Not so crowded and many hip independent shops among Korean traditional houses. Good place for walk! I highly recommend here. My favorite place in Seoul
171,4.0,The Bukchon Hanok village is a lovely area just next to one of the big palaces. The traditional architecture is interesting.
172,5.0,You will see traditional style houses preserved like in the old days situated not too far from the urbanized Seoul:) I felt like I time travelled in an instant:) There are people walking around on their hanbok dresses so it’s so fun and educational at the same time!

176,5.0,Nice area gives nice scent of traditional Korean-style. Many cafes and nice places to have a cup of tea or snacks.
177,4.0,"Its a sight seeing area where you can see traditional Korea  housing. Just a short distance, with 10 minutes walk you can see everything in this neighborhood. Don't forget to take lots of pictures."
178,3.0,We were lost looking for this place as it is spread out and not very well signed.  I would have enjoyed hearing about the place through a guide.  Go when you aren't tired.  The teriyaki chicken stick and beer saved the afternoon for me!
179,5.0,"Loved how everyone were wearing hanbok. Village is full of cute shops, where you can spend all your money on beautiful Korean made clothes. Prices are little bit cheaper than Myeongdong shopping street. From village you can walk to the Palace."
180,5.0,"Love walking this area because it really feels like you are walking inside a real life Korean drama scene in the olden times. Do wear comfortable shoes though as there is alot of walking to do. You can also rent a hanbok for an hour or two to walk around the area. It's definitely worth a photo shoot. Also, you can visit the high school that was used for filming in Winter Sonata (yes, it's a long time drama, but still worth a visit. We all love Korean dramas don't we? :))."
181,4.0,"I suggest you include this in your itinerary if you are interested to see traditional houses in Seoul. Get a map from the tourist information center. Not sure if seeing students in their hanbok is common but it was truly a nice scene when they are around the area. Wear comfortable shoes and I think it is nicer if it will be done in the morning or during sunset. It has 2 different areas and you can easily get lost in the small alleys and small stairways but never fear because there are a lot of tourist around. You must schedule this on a day where you won't feel pressured walking around. The more you pay attention to the details of the houses the more it will be interesting.Before you go, check what else you can do because I noticed that there are cooking classes or some sort of art classes around there too. Also, if the news shows that there are a lot of people on streets on rally/picketing around the King Sejong statue then avoid this area as no cabs will take you there or pick you up if it is late at night.I also recommend that you stay around this area, its quite a good place to experience traditional houses and it is also close to the tourist hot spots. There was one area with a lot of good food and office workers are actually dine there."
182,5.0,"A popular tourist spot where we can see a lot of traditional Korean houses. Good for taking photos but some tourists are quite noisy and might disturb the residents there. It will be great if one or two houses can be open to the public.,"
183,4.0,"One of the ancient village in korea which a lot of tourist come ,see ,explore how the old Koreans lived before.This village are open all year round for free admission You can also wear a traditional dress if you want,there's a store before you can enter the village It cost 20$ I think for the rent and free photo ,"
184,5.0,This place has its ancient Korean look which will give all photographers chances to have their best shot. Visitors will have a chance to experience how a korean person live back to half of century.
185,3.0,not really ancient thou. It's good for photos. That's it. You can rent hanbok there but I suggest you should do so at some palace.
186,1.0,"This place is a 15 min walk from Gyeongbokgung palace and another 15 minute walk to Changdeokgung and  Cheonggyecheon palace as it is in between the palaces. It is cheaper to rent Hanbok in Gyeongbukgong as they only charge 15-18k KRW for for hours, but in bukchon hanok village it costs 10 KRW per hour so places offer rentals from 30 - 40 k KRW. ALSO DO NOT RENT HANBOK in the rental shop inside the Bukchon-ro 11 na gil street (after Etude house and can be seen as soon as you enter the street left side). THE LADY THERE ALMOST SCAMMED US! first she said that the rental for four hours was 30 KRW, as we didn't have any choice left as we didn't want to walk 15 mins back, we just agreed. And then when we already had the hanboks on they were offering hair clips, bags etc. They just put it on our head and gave it to us. Good thing we resesrched that these things have additional charges so when we asked she said yes we needed to pay extra. So we returned it and said no, we just wanted to pay for the Hanbok rental. So after putting it on and paying for it, she sat us down and pointed at the headband. She said ""already included"" and then braided our hair and gave us bags. We said, no no we just want the hanbok rental. And then she said ""sorry I made a mistake, already included."" Ok then we let her do her thing. And then after braiding our hair she was asking for 41 k KRW! because she said that she made a mistake as 30k KRW was onky for 2.5 hours and not 4, plus the braiding services bag etc. We said no we only wanted the clothes and we were refusing the add -ons since the beginning. We stood our ground and almost got very angry until she said ok. But we should've just removed the Hanbok and embarass ourselves in the store because WE SHOULDN'T have continued to rent that hanbok there! My friend sprained her ankle just minjtes after rentinf the hanbok and we adked if we cpuld just return it since we were going home and we will pay for 1 hour worth of rental fee. SHE DID NOT agree despite the situation being an emergency. Given everything she put us through she wouldn't budge even in this situation. She honestly ruined the experience for me. Bukchon Hanok Village is not worth the effort and hassle we have been put through. I feel really disappointed because the people were very accommodating, kind and agreeable until we reached Bukchon Hanok Village. So no, not worth it at all. Just go to the palaces if you would like to see and take pictures of historical architecture."
187,4.0,Lovely traditional Korean architecture. You get a view of the city and it's a lovely way to walk off the lunch. A natural stair master! The houses are situated on hills and some parts are quite steep. So be prepared for the climb. Also there are many tourists dressed in traditional Korean outfits so it may be sometimes hard to take a photo without others inside.
188,5.0,"My friend Dimitri insist that we must visit Bukchon Hanok Village, many thanks for him for that, this is a wonderful and amazing place, it's a must visited place in Seoul, the beauty of this place is that showing Old city of Seoul, the streets are so clean, tourist guide informing you where to go, shops, resturants and coffee shops are there for you with reasonable prices, houses are for rich people (may be second house for them) or big families have houses there, you can see very luxury cars inside the houses, you can meet as well Korean with there heritage and tradition dress, they are so friendly, you need to walk for 30 minutes between the houses, I was there with my friends, Dimitri from Greece, Faten and Rana from Lebanon."
189,5.0,Wanted to rent a hanbok to take photos with the beautiful houses but the summer weather doesn't allow :( awesome place for ig worthy photos!
190,4.0,"This place is known for its traditional housing images of Korea. It is interesting to see and walk around because cars hardly go through there. The downside is all the tourists are also there like tour groups, families, friends, and couples all walking throughout. So that means getting a shot of an entire empty street is not easy especially if you want the best views. It's a quiet area and there are no shopping stores within so its not like modern areas taken over by all the lighting and music."
191,4.0,"the best moment to visit this place with hanbok experience. you can rent it out for 2 hours or more for around 15,000 won. There are alot rental shop surrounding this area"
192,4.0,"Feel the place, live like local. after going to Gyeongbokgung Palace, I plan to go to this place, walking around 20 mins then you can taking a deep breath and see the surrounding area, just imagine you live in Bukchon, feel so happy to get here :)"

194,5.0,"go early. very very early. things may not be open yet, but you can get your drinks/meals/souvenir somewhere else. it's a lovely place to walk around wherever your feet takes you, take in the atmosphere. by 9.30 the area will be buzzing with loud tourists taking selfies although there are many signs to warn people to be quiet because real people still live in the area. be considerate. it will be great of you can stay at one of the hanok so you can be there before/after the horde."
195,5.0,"If you are interested in seeing a traditional Korean house, so this is the right place to come. Bukchon Hanok Village is the neighborhood area with traditional house. There are also have coffee shop, boutiques and many more shops inside this area. Worth it. I suggest you go to every 8 spots to take a amazing pictures."
196,5.0,"If you're interested in seeing some traditional homes, this is your spot. Lots of tourists line the streets, so getting an early start definitely works to your advantage. Since it's in one of the hilly areas of the city, you can walk up to the top and see all the traditional roofs surrounded by more modern buildings surrounded by mountains. It's quiet and beautiful and harbors lots of cute boutiques, mini museums/galleries, and food spots along the way."
197,5.0,"Gyeongbok palace & SamCheongDong & Bukchon Han-ok village are close enough to walk around. Looking around Gyeongbok palace, having lunch or dinner in SamCheongDong and then walking along Bukchon han-ok, it is more like a timeslip, experience tradition and modernity at the same time."
198,3.0,"It's still a housing estate so you shouldn't be making a lot.of noise there. The houses are quite pretty coz of their roofs. If you wanna see prettier and much more bukchon houses, go to jeonju, outside of seoul , 3 hr bus ride.If you wanna see even older houses, travel back.in time, visit the Korean folk village at suwon. traditional Performances included. About 2.5 hrs away from seoul by metro. However, it's just a remake of a village not an actual one"
199,5.0,"There are not many culturally unique place in Seoul to visit, beside the palace, this hilly Korean tradition houses are unique and great to roam around in Korean traditional costumes (recommend to rent one, the price is reasonable). It's not very close to the station,need to walk for a while, do take exit 2, if you come by metro Angu station.  Recommend to stop by tourist office to get a map."
200,5.0,I love this area very much. It is very traditional. Just walk around and you can imagine yourself dressing in Hanbok! This area is also a walkable distance to Samchongdong which is full of shops and cafes. It is also very nice to walk in fall.
201,5.0,"I like this old style village in Seoul.  It is nice to have a look there, get a drink in one of the cafés and take some photographs."
202,5.0,Beautiful old and small houses. Just take a slow stroll between the houses. Many tourists though. Since there are locals living there you have to be quiet to show respect for them. Unfortunately some people dont seem to understand that.
203,5.0,"Loved my visit to the Bukchon Hanok Village! This is the only place in Seoul which still has traditional korean hanoks around. It's amazing to see traditional houses right in the middle of the otherwise cosmopolitan city, almost like taking a time machine back to Joseon era!"
204,5.0,"If you never been to a traditional Korean ""village"" this is a place for you!  The village is not far, and when you walk in you feel this is very different from the city - you can see the old architecture, building, culture.  If you love those old style building, don't miss this place."
205,5.0,"If you don't get the chance to get outside of Seoul during your trip and want to see a Hanok village, this is a good option. Our Korean friend was super excited that we were finally visiting Korea and wanted to show us around, Bukchon was one of the places he brought us one afternoon. It's a very pretty, quiet place to walk around for a couple hours, and there are some nice little shops there, especially if you are interested in Hanbok clothing or crafts. If you have the opportunity to see other Hanok villages on your visit to Korea, you probably don't ""need"" to visit this one, but if you have an interest in them, this is a very nice place to walk around and take some photos."
206,4.0,"Probably worth visiting once but not as good as the traditional streets in Kyoto, Japan. Many resturants."
207,5.0,"Bukchon Hanok Village is a Korean traditional village in Seoul with a long history located between Gyeongbok Palace, Changdeok Palace and Jongmyo Royal Shrine. Just go to Anguk Station and. Just drop at Anguk Station exit 2 and walk straight. However, if you like you can visit first Gyeongbok Palace and after walk to Bukchon, at Bukchon you can also find the best Korean Ginseng Chicken Soup going to Insadong area.  There are so many traditional Korean houses here and if you are a Kdrama fanatic, you can see the house of Lee minho in Personal Taste drama , House #3. Enjoy your visit at Bukchon hanok village."
208,4.0,I found this overrated but good nonetheless as it gives you a glimpse of actual Korean residence without the trappings of highrise living. When visiting this place be mindful though that it still a residential area so keep your voices down. Just take good photos.
209,5.0,"If you want to see traditional Korean houses in Seoul, the best place may be Bukchon Hanok Village. But, someone live here. You need to watch your manners in public places."
210,5.0,Bukchon has really old traditional houses that people live in actually. On the hill you can see Seoul N tower. A bit hilly but nice to take a walk
211,4.0,A lovely place to visit in the city. Nice area and walking routes through a residential area featuring the old style of houses. Great photo opportunities and views across the city. The quaint shops lining the streets toward the station were interesting and nice to pop in. Nice away from the real hustle and bustle of the city.The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I currently live in Jeonju and we have the infamous hanok village.
212,5.0,"Such an adorable little village and a must to visit during your trip to Korea.  If you can, book an Air BnB and stay in a hanok for an amazing experience."
213,3.0,"Small ""village"" which is basically a few old houses (representative of traditional Korean houses) on the hill overlooking the city that has not yet been demolised to make way for tall towers. If you really don't have much time in Seoul, can skip this."
214,5.0,Very unique place. This is the traditional place to take picture.  You can find many place to rent a traditional hanbok
215,5.0,"Enjoyed the walk up the hill and taking photos of the beautiful houses along the way.  When you get to the top of the hill, you can see a great view of the city all the way across the N Tower.   Great place to just take a walk and enjoy the neighborhood."
216,3.0,"Warning: Bad English! Bukchon is the perfect area to explore real Korean culture in the city center. Though this area is very touristy but still a quick way to observe the real Korean while enjoying shopping and eating.Go to the tourist information center and grab a map to guide your way through. Without the  map it is pretty easy to get lost as all houses seem to look the same! There are 8 photo spots where you can get the best photos of Bukchon, especially number 5 and 6 on Gahoe-dong alley are the most popular spots (and of course most crowded). Actually number 5 and 6 are the same spot but one is from the upward view and the others is downward. Bukchon is surrounded by souvenir shops, cloth shops, restaurants, tea houses and hanbok (traditional Korean dress) rental shops. In every minute I saw women in hanbok walking around and take selfies, that's cute. Be quiet and respect the locals since this is a residential area. There are signs telling you not to disturb the locals. Just a few hundred meters north of Bukchon, it's Samcheongdong-gil road where there are heaps of nice restaurants. And if you walk further, you can find Gyeongbokgung palace, Changdeokgung palace and Jongmyo shrine. So come in the early morning to complete this walking route. It's an easy and joyful whole day trip. I visited Bukchon in mid April and I saw some cherry blossoms. I think if you wish to see them in full bloom, you need to come in early April."
217,5.0,"Hanok is a term used to describe Korean traditional houses. Beautiful place to stroll around.  Authentic Korean houses with a lot of nice souvenir shops, coffee shops and also restaurants. You can rent hanbok here and you can also enter some of the houses for free."
218,4.0,"I'm a big fan of Korean dramas, so this place is gold for me. My friends and I found joy in just walking around in very cold weather (less than 10 degree Celsius), we stopped for photos every 5 minutes because every corner of this village look great in photos."
219,5.0,This area is beautiful. Seoul is one of the most interesting cities because of its ability to mix new and old architecture. The village is very fun to have a walk in.
220,5.0,"nice walk around traditional homes - you need to keep quiet because it is a residential area. for an added flavour, rent some traditional clothes to wear on your walk. great photo opportunity if there weren't so many tourists."
221,3.0,"We walked the main street as per the map, & although not sure what we were looking for, we didn't find it!!  With some help in translating, we asked some police officers, they couldn't tell us where the village was either!It's an older area, & well maintained, although we didn't find anything ""traditional""."
222,5.0,"You are surrounded by houses built in the traditional Korean style. There are places where you can rent Hanbok, traditional dress, and it's lovely to see people walking around wearing them, taking photos! We found a nice tea house where you can enjoy some authentic Korean tea and snacks!! A place you must visit!!"
223,5.0,"One of my American friend wanted to visit Bukchon, so we took a trip here on sunny sunday. It was a good choice. If you visit Bukchon, walk along ""북촌팔경(8 views of Bukchon) and see the city's skyline from the top of hill. There are signs pointing it everywhere, so it's easy to find the way. Also, there are plenty of free galleries around this village. Their sizes are humble but pieces in them are quite good and modern. Most of the exhibitions are held in Hanok houses, so you can actually get into the houses to see them. For rooftop view, there's a good spot at Old Bath House building. Now it is changed into eyeglasses shop(""Gentle Monster"") and its rooftop on 3rd floor is opened to public."
224,4.0,"Great visit to Bukchon Hanok Village. There two places you can go around. from the National museum, you can cross the road and go straight along the streets. you can wander around the but you need to careful because there are people living there. There are signage that tells you to ""shhhhhhhh"". You can take a pictures here and there and also you can see the view of Seoul from here too.Aside from the architecture, nothing much you can do here. To go there : you need a courage to climb up the stairs. Prepare some water along your way."
225,4.0,"This area of the old style houses is very interesting.It's still lived in so there are the ""Shhhhhh...."" signs which is a nice touch.The small streets & architecture of the old style Hanok Houses is very interesting.Recommended viewing if in Seoul."
226,5.0,One of best... area we visited. We love to go back and stay more time. Great place to see the old house... Great place to take photos.
227,5.0,Another great spot in Seoul. Im jealous of the people who get to live here. The architecture is beautiful and there are an infinite amount of spots to take great pictures. There are also plenty of stops to eat and have a beer. Definitely worth a few hours of your time.
228,4.0,A place where you can see the distinction of old  to modern houses. They preserved the legacy of the past. Enjoy walking and you can feel the tranquility of the village especially If most of the visitors know how to show respect by not too noisy. Most of the houses are privately owned and they need privacy. Visitors should take that into consideration. We should be thankful because they open their village and they allow peoiple to step along their historical place.
229,5.0,You will see how Seoul looked befaore the civil war and can sea the dramatical changes from traditional to modern western city
230,5.0,"This place gives you a good insight into how Korean people lived in the past. Luckily, people still live there today and you will come across a open house for you to explore.You have to remember to be quiet when you are waling around, people still live here and go about their daily lives.Great for photography. So many alleys and streets to explore with some little hidden gems to discover. I think a review is useful to highlight what this place is all about, but I really do not want to spoil it for you. Put this on your list of must see places in Seoul. You will not be disappointed."
231,5.0,"I rented a hanbok from a shop in the village and walked around. The hanbok rental shop opens at 10am and it costs 15,000 KRW for a 2 hour rental! It was a very fun experience and I took many photos at the hanok village. There is a museum there where you can actually walk in and see the interior of a hanok. There are also many shops there where you can engage in some craft works, like embroidery or knot tying. However, these workshops can be a little pricey."
232,5.0,Me and some friends rented Korean outfit and walked the streets for about 2 hours.  I highly recommend doing this.  We had a lot of fun.
233,4.0,"15 mins walk from Anguk station Exit 2. It's actually a residential area so you can't go inside the houses to see. It was hot when we went so the fruit flavoured soft ice cream was a wonderful treat. Love the grape flavour best, tastes just like grape bubble gum! It's uphill walking so wear comfortable walking shoes. We dropped in to a traditional Korean tea house for a drink and to rest. The cold drinks served were really refreshing. Quite pricey though."
234,5.0,I love the fact that seoul still preserve the traditional houses quite well. Tourists still able to stroll sround the neighborhood and enjoy the scenery while being lost in the trace of Jeoseon.  Sometimes I feel like I'm time travelling.Be reminded that real people live in the area as it's a real neighborhood. So please be mind of your voice while strolling around.
235,5.0,Visited Hanok Village. It's a nice 1 hour stop over to visit traditional Korean houses and take some great photos. Theres one house towards the beginning of the street where you can walk around inside.  Make sure to grab some photos at the top overlooking the village with the city back drop.
236,4.0,"Quaint place to go..Anguk Subway Line. Be prepared for a long walk and absorbed in the atmosphere. Here one can see many of the young & tourists will dressed up in Hanbok (National custume) and walk around here. A very lively pleasant scene...and they do look very good in them. Took us half a day here, Absorbed in their culture, there are people still living in the Hanok Village, thus one need to be aware and try not to disturb the neighborhood peace & serenity.There are also some nice shops here too...quaint local restaurants too..Seeing the Hanboks I get the feel of being drifted into their period dramas...One get free entry into the Gyeongbokung Palace. This is the original Palace , the other Changdeokung Palace is the UNESCO site. Both palaces situated around Bukchon Hanok Village...but rather far away from one another...Once you are around here, one can get to Insadong as well.Thus one need a full day of energy to do the whole area outside Anguk Subway!"
237,3.0,"Nothing much in the area except to see the traditional houses. There is a famous lookout spot for you to overlook Korea, but the view is not great. Headed to the palaces shortly after."
238,4.0,"Bukchon originally was just a small residential village and due to the exposure of the K-dramas and became a tourist spot. The village preserved the traditional house structure and design of Korea. It's actually nice to walk around the area. There're nice cafe and restaurant around that offers traditional teas and dishes.And you can see staff walking area with a ""quiet"" sign, cause Bukchon is still a resident place."
239,5.0,"The Bukchon area spreads around Anguk Station. The area is quite large, so it may be a good idea to plan in advance based on what you would like to see. I chose the area where you can see the palace and traditional houses, since I had a limited time in the afternoon. If you have more time, you could walk more and see more. I found a free map/area guide along the way from Anguk station, and it was quite informative as well. People live in those traditional houses, you'd better not to disturb them."
240,5.0,I visited Bukchon hanok village with my friend. I like those beautiful traditional houses. Eventhough they were old but those owner maintained them very well. Unfortunately we cannot enter those because they are private residence.
241,4.0,Cant be here for long coz this is a private house for some peoples. And please be quite here if you dont want to makes the 'ajumma' with a board angry ;))Better you take a pic here with using hanbok !!
242,3.0,basically im not impress with bukchon hanok village. it waste my time for 1hour. it walking distance to gyeongbokgung palace & national folk museum.
243,5.0,"Make sure to spend time wandering the streets of Bukchon while in Seoul.  There are guides and a route, that takes you up some lively streets with cute little shops and artist galleries, and also quieter neighborhood streets.  We very much recommend trying to do the whole loop, as it is a great way to see the beautiful old Hanoks and neighborhoods. Make sure to leave time to pop in and out of places that intrigue you, and if you have an extra hour to try your hand at learning some traditional Korean arts from the many workshops tucked into the streets."
244,5.0,Beautiful place to take a walk along the traditional Korean houses which there is people staying there.  Will see alot of silence sign on the door.  Still a good place to walk and take picture.
245,4.0,"The alleys brings you back to the past. The beautiful architecture of the structures there are affidavits of the history. Bukchon Hanok Village preserves South Korea's traditional art by offering activities with trainers to everyone. In the small room, one could feel the passion of the trainers with the intricacy of the handicrafts made. It was a wonderful experience for a first timer with clumsy limbs."
246,5.0,We were lucky to enjoy the beauty of the cherry blossoms while we were strolling the area which has many little shops offering interesting finds.Nice place to spend your day in a relaxed atmosphere.
247,4.0,"We came to this place by subway, stop in anguk station (orange line) and walk by 700 meter.This village is beautiful, there are some traditional houses, shops, small but cozy cafe, alleys with unforgettable memories.In some shops you can borrow hanbok, traditional dress with many color. Local people and tourist like to spend their time here.One fine day, we stroll along the village, this village also residential area, so we have to keep silent.If hungry, there're a lot of snack seller. I tried toppoki (traditional snack), strawberry mochi and enjoy them so much."
248,5.0,At least half  day tour. Must try Hanbok at only 5000 won rental. Many shop. Wonderful  scenery. Also have a lot of restaurants. Free enter.
249,5.0,"An awesome place to walk around and feel the old Seoul, with gorgeous traditional houses.Great place for photography. the streets are narrow, downhill and uphill. Wear good walking shoes."
250,5.0,This is an awesome cultural place with beautiful architecture. Very nice walk with many old traditional houses. You will run to many visitors in Korean traditional hanbok. Such a wonderful place to visit in Seoul.Surrounding this village is a number of small and cute boutiques.
251,4.0,I love the look of the buildings. The architectural and colors are very captivating. A good place for photography and you can also rent the hanbok (culture wear) and take photos around there. A lot of nice buildings. Good for half day tour.
252,4.0,Walking along the street with nice architecture seen @village. Lovely place with a typical touch of Korean culture.
253,5.0,"This small village really takes you back to the Emperial era in Seoul, with its traditional homes and the nearby residential areas."
254,5.0,"Loved walking around here. The main street is all modern, shops and restaurants.  Up the side streets you find traditional homes and residential areas. Some hills are steep.  Really great to see the contrast. Many Chinese tourists hire hanboks and pose for photos here! Funny to watch. I think this is a must visit place."
255,5.0,Stroll through this area to see the traditional hanok homes/buildings. Some have been restored and are much more modern looking. I enjoyed chatting with a local shopkeeper that invited me to stay and enjoy a baked sweet potato with her. This was another favorite area of Seoul
256,3.0,"There are a lot of Hanok Style homestay around this area. Besides sightseeing , there are some food stall and local made craft around this area as well. Generally it is a residential area ."
257,5.0,"Stay between 2 biggest palaces in Seoul, Bukchon Hanok village is so awesome pretty with all traditional  architect designs. You should borrow Hanbok and walk around to visit Bukchon and take many many colorful phótos. The air's so cool and fresh to enjoy your day here. Tips: 1. Borrowing Hanbok in Insadong street ( oposite the way to come in Bukchon) with 15.000 won/ 4 hours. I checked some other places, the price is more expensive than in Insadong.2. You can also visit 2 palaces beside at the same time when wearing Hanbok and you will got a FREE TICKET 🤗"
258,5.0,"In a top 10 ""must see"" list, I know to visit Bukchon in the palace district. It was a pleasant surprise to be in a cultural preservation section in the middle of downtown Seoul. My only mistake was not to plan to eat there. There're many little restaurants along the alleys, which I vow I will go back next time I visit.  Although not many people speak English, the vendors graciously point seemingly lost tourist like myself in the right direction. Definitely bring a good camera, if you love taking photo. I wish I have mine, but I have to content with my camera phone.  Enjoy the exhibit at the visiting center; and read the history of the village at the front. Seeing modern shops w/in the well-preserved traditional structures was simply incredible. The pride of the community is hard to miss. You won't be disappointed."
259,4.0,"Great to spend an afternoon walking around. It'll take about two hours to go round the neighborhood where you can see the old houses, do some shopping or sit and watch couples/girls in their traditional costumes ""Hanbok"" walking around. They have maintained this residential area making it a very pleasant place to hangout."
260,4.0,"If I come here again, might try to stay in one of the guest house here. Like many old town in the world, it fill with modern shop, coffee house, sunny and relax.Like some local student, I rent the traditional dress and took some photos, loving it."
261,4.0,"Bukchon Hanok Village is not really touching about traditional that much some of hanoks are renovated, new building designed to be the original but i did not disappoint it"
262,5.0,really very nice place.. although a very long walk..it features real houses in the middle of the city that reflects the early culture of korea.. alot of young people even rent Hanok and walk up the hill to take pictures.. scenery was scenic but it was really a long walk and because we went in winter.. the walk doesn't end up in sweats.. :D
263,5.0,It was so memorable to take picture there. This place is located near Gyeongbukgong so I can go there by walking.
264,5.0,"Bring your camera as there is a lot of photogenic spot here. Yes, it's a very touristy place so you might want to go early in the morning to avoid the crowd. This place located 10 minutes walk from Anguk station."
265,4.0,Very crowded and many traditional korean house. You can enter old house for tea ceremony but not free.
266,4.0,"we walked around the area, lots of boutique stores along with the traditional housing architech. Nice area to spend about 3-4 hours wondering around but keep in mind its a tourist spot!"
267,5.0,"This is such a beautiful area where people actually still reside in. The area is hilly so be sure to wear comfortable shoes. On a day where I walked a lot, scaling the hills was a bit of a challenge. The architecture and the doors are so very beautiful."
268,5.0,Dont forget to try hanbokI believe there is a lot hanbok rental hereI endedup going to place that I cant used it to far from the rental area
269,4.0,There are 8 tourist spots to take beautiful photos in this area. Just make sure u ask the cute guys in red who are from the tourist information centre where are the spots and you will get to take spectacular photos in the alleys between the houses. There are also shops offering hanbook experience where u can rent the Korean traditional clothes and walk around taking photos. These will be a good destination for bridal photo shooting.
270,5.0,"It was packed full of tourists, but understandably so.  Some of the most charming streets I've ever walked.  Beautiful, intricate architecture on every corner of these homes (private residences actually) make for lovely stroll and great photo ops.  What I found particularly striking was as you walk down these streets that sort of take you back in time, you look up and see the modern skyline as a backdrop.  The Samcheongdong area is also a must visit.  It is small, but very historic and the mountains in the background are so beautiful."
271,4.0,"I highly recommend a stroll through Bukchon. It is very quaint peaceful, at least when we went (late afternoon after it stopped raining).  Thee traditional Korean houses are very beautiful.  If possible, go with a local who can point out interesting tidbits about the area (if you watch K-dramas some of them were filmed here, and certain celebrities also live here).  Make sure you respect the residents there by remaining quiet and do not trespass onto their property by going off the streets."
272,4.0,"This place is filled with lanes and lanes of traditional Korean houses. Like my friends said, this place is totally Instagram worthy and we took at least 3 hours walking around the neighborhood taking tons and tons of photo. You can easily rent traditional Korean Hanboks at only 10,000 Won for 2 hours just outside the neighborhood.1 thing to note is that, the neighborhood is filled with steep slopes, so it might get abit tiring after awhile as you have to constantly climb the slopes."
273,4.0,"Traditional houses, well maintained, and a lovely place to walk around in good weather.  Good photo opportunities as well."
274,5.0,It's a great place to see traditional style of Korean houses. Local people live in the house so it's not too touristy place. It's quite close to Samcheong dong with cool shops and restaurants and many Korean people hang out there.
275,3.0,"We nearly got lost finding this area if it wasn't for the help of those 3 policemen. Located between Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung Palaces, this street lined with old houses is a great place to visit for those interested in old korean architectures. Please note that visiting this place involves a bit of an uphill climb."
276,5.0,We spent an hour or so walking around and taking pictures before we got too cold to continue and had to go inside for mulled wine. You can go to the bukchon culture center and get a map that suggests a walking route and where to take the best pictures. There are also museums with art activities like making bracelets or kites or weaving but it seemed like you needed to have booked them in advance
277,4.0,i've been there to discover more of korean traditional architecture but i actually think it's a nice place to walk and have a coffee with your boyfriend/girlfriend. Atmosphere is really calm.
278,4.0,Well preserved traditional houses. Good for photo taking. There's a lot of walking so be prepared. Very nice ambiance as the places are pretty quiet (other than a lot of students walking up and down as there are universities around that area)
279,5.0,So the concept of the Buckhon Traditional Village is to showcase the Korean tradition and architecture and preserve it by means of creating a residential place around that concept. There are people actually staying in the houses and there are tours organised for visiting the place and looking at how the homes used to be constructed. However we had less time in hand and did not go for detailed exploration. Still even the outside view and walk around this place itself is enough to give you an idea of what a beauty it is!!! The culture is reflected through this place. Best Views and Scenic Place for photography. . .  get your cameras out!!!
280,5.0,"Not much to see  when we were there, just the houses. But it gives you a glimpse of old Korean culture."
281,4.0,"I considered Bukchon as one of Seoul's historical sight seeing place to go. You can still enjoy the old Korean Village vibe through the houses architecture and narrow streets. I took the train and stop at Anguk Station, it's a walkable distance.If you happened to visit during fall -winter, I recommend getting there in the morning where the streets is still empty (some stores might as well). But it's the perfect time for you to actually look and enjoy the environment. The area is loaded with food, crafts, coffee & tea shops (Ossuloc Tea!). It's a huge area, so bear with the walk. If you're tired, take a stop at the nearest shops if you wish. There's a great Coldnoodle & dumpling restaurant near the road entrance (closest to Anguk St). It's in the narrow street. If you have problems with wanting a clean bathroom there's one in the Museum (near the bicycle parking area. A bit of a walk if you're around the north area. Might as well spend the whole day walking around if you love a good walk as much as I do."
282,3.0,"The Bukchon village is really pretty. However I wouldn't get carried away. It's a small area, it's a very organized tourist experience and everything there is expensive."
283,5.0,"This area was amazing to me in America we don't have whole neighborhoods that are 500 years old. I didn't feel bad because there are many signs telling you to be quite people love here, so don't take your LOUD friends. ;)"
284,5.0,"There is a good amount of exercise involved- narrow alleyways, very steep slope and stairs. A good time to go would be in the afternoon. At the bottom there are a few shops and boutique stores. Dolls wearing traditional Korean dresses also found here."
285,4.0,"The road below the Bukchon Hanok Village had clusters of private galleries, cafes and shops which makes it fun to explore and just have a cuppa in. To get to the village - follow the brown signs and be prepared to climb up a steep flight of stairs. Once there - just walk freely and you will eventually come across the popular slope where people like to take photos in. There are free maps along the roads so just grab one and explore on."
286,4.0,"This area has rows and rows of houses that are in traditional Korean style. There are signs that post recommended paths to walk through. It is residential area with people who still live in the houses, so being quiet is a must. Very nice views from the higher streets. Many of the streets are fairly steep, but it's not extremely strenuous once you get to the top area and walk back down. There are a few smaller boutique style stores near the bottom area, some small eateries, and some small souvenir shops. There are also some cultural buildings that are open to walk around in and some paid activities to do, such as wearing era appropriate costumes or making little trinkets to take home. Nice way to spend some time walking around. Beautiful views from the top and great architecture you won't find anywhere else."
287,4.0,Good place for photoshoot... but sometimes theres alot of visitor and its hard to take a good photo...
288,5.0,A very beautiful place that presents the old architecture. Don't miss the artist-name difficult to remember- who has wonderful collection of his paintings-the swans and horses ; a few to remember.The people who live there even now get the credit of maintaining the past so meticulously. A wonderful place.
289,3.0,A charming place to visit and experience walking through traditional Korean houses in the neighbourhood but also very touristy. Do take note that this is a residential area so keep your volume down!
290,4.0,"i went to this place with my friends at summer holiday, we waste some times to find this place because it is not very easy to find, so i suggest people should find some information from internet. I think the view is good and those building is special. There are so many stores which can rent some korea traditional clothing for people to take photo, but you should decide it carefuly, because some of it is expensive. We can feel the korea culture and the history at this place. We chage our clothes to korea traditional clothing and take a lot of photos at this place, the korea traditional clothing are very match with that environment. we feel like we are back in the korea old time, the feeling is interesting."
291,4.0,"Bukchon Village is still a residential area and despite signs asking people to be quiet, many inconsiderate tourists still natter on at the top of their voices. Otherwise a quaint area with many houses still boasting the wooden beams and eaves that mark the architecture of a past era. A little bit of a hike through the hilly streets. Good to start with this before heading to Insadong"
292,3.0,Very subdued old neighborhood where you can still see what Seoul used to look like before modernization. Takes about an hour to walk through it. It's nothing spectacular but a convenient location to add to your list of sightseeing if you're visiting the palaces nearby.
293,4.0,the hundreds year old houses nicely retained and still inhabitant. make sure be quiet and be polite while taking photo. Of cause surrounded by souvenir shops and cafe for tourists.
294,4.0,"I took the metro to Anguk and took exit 2. Heading up the road there are some quaint side streets and coffee shops/cafes that align the road. I managed to pick up a free guide of the area from a stand that had a useful map and a basic route that allows you to circle round the area going up hill area to the main area where the streets are lined with traditional Hanok houses.It's good to take your time and enjoy the area generally. The walk up the hill isn't too onerous and there are plenty of opportunities to take photos. There are quite a lot of people wandering around seeing the houses so be patient if you want to take photos as most people walk along the same route. As the houses are actual residences there are many signs asking people to not be too loud and be respectful. Some houses were open for visitors for a fee however I didn't take that option.The route down from the hill also presents itself with many opportunities for those who like to shop. There are also a large number of quaint and traditional looking tea houses plus the more modern coffee houses so take you time, wander the streets and sit down for a drink if you want to rest up!"
