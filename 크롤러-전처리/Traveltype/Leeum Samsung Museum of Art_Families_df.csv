0,5.0,"A beutifully designed art museum, containing both a section of modern, contemporary art and one with classic Korean art. One of the best art museums I have visited. The museum, slightly tucked away from the main street is superbly designed and every item in the museum has plenty of space and is exhibited with outmost respect. It is delightful to walk around and watch modern classic western art mixed with modern Korean art. And for a European, just fantastic to see new artists and new motifs, rarely on show in Europe. If interested in art, in my view a must see. If not for the paintings then at least for the design of the museum."
1,5.0,"It is located around the Namsan area and the surroundings of the museum is picturesque with well-considered landscaping that can be seen from the inside of the museum. It is as though the exterior is part of the modern art installation. The best part of the learning journey was the Audio Guide which is a Samsung handheld device with a hook-on ear-piece which is way better than eat-pod types in terms of hygiene. The device operates on blue-tooth and will be activated at each exhibit Automatically. The curator’s rendition of each art work is meticulously crafted in a precise and concise manner that triggers our curiosity of each art work. If you prefer to read, the written version stored on the device is easily accessed. While the written and spoken form do not correspond word-for-word, the essence is captured similarly. There are 2 museums - Museum 1 focuses on Korean art historically, mainly Celadon Ink paintings and Calligraphy. The details captured in the audio guide feeds the mind and it is as though from one exhibit to the next, the storytelling is integrated as one whole. Museum 2 focuses on Modern Art by Korean artists and artists from different parts of the world. It has a great balance of variety from installations to fine art, paintings and art forms that might not mean much to the viewer except for visual and aesthetic appeals. But once the audio guide is tuned in, our minds start to sponge up the incredible meaning behind each creation including art trends, artists’ developments and societal influences...which speaks volumes into the depth of research and understanding of each art investment. We spent a total of 4 hours and it was time well invested! We lap it all up and hope that more people will enjoy this too! My son is a teen and he was totally intrigued - no WhatsApp nor IG during those fulfilling hours of discovery. Thank you Leeum Samsung!  Kudos to the Curators and Writers."
2,4.0,"If you enjoy art, this museum is nice. It has two sections, traditional art which was mostly ancient Korean pottery, and a modern art section which is mostly paintings. It is not a very large museum and the pieces are quite spread out so unless you really enjoy taking time at each piece you can go through quite quickly. Just note you are not allowed to take photos here. At the time we visited the entry fee was 10,000 won."
3,5.0,Stunning museum. The architecture is splendid. The modern interpretation of a spiral cathedral-like staircase a highlight. The light entering modern museum number two. Collection small but perfectly formed. Highlight for us were the 4th floor museum number one - celadon pieces.
4,5.0,"This gallery was a real treasure to find. The modern art work was just beautiful. Please note that the “spider” is not at the gallery anymore, although it is still on the website. Plenty of other great works to view in an amazing building. Very pleasant afternoon viewing."
5,3.0,For me it was boring. I have visited lots of museums and some of them were awesome and interesting and some of them were boring and not so interesting. Some of exhibits were really interesting and unusual. But generally it was like average. In this museum was absolutely quiet. I would give for this museum like 2 stars and half.
6,5.0,I highly recommend getting the audio headset which is very inexpensive compared to other museums and adds a lot more context to the tight descriptions on display. Good variety in the collection with a bit over balance on pottery and ceramics. The structure itself is breathtaking and overall worth a 2 hour visit. I suggest skimming through the areas to focus on those that are more suited to one's interests as the collection is quite large.
7,4.0,"Samsung Museum is very nice place for people who are interested in arts. It is possible to visit two different sections, one on traditional arts and second on contemporary arts. Location is easily accessible. Audio guide is available. Entrance fee is reasonable. Especially contemporary arts section has interesting artistic creatures from both Korean and non-Korean artists."
8,5.0,"Originally funded by the Samsung heir family, the museum is a collection of three buildings designed by internationally-renowned architects.  Located along the hilly street in posh Itaewon, Rem Koolhaas designed the Temporary Exhibitions musem which features interesting exhibitions several times a year.  Adjacent to the outdoor sculpture garden is a two storey structure designed by Jean Nouvel housing the modern arts permanent collection.  Tucked in back in terra cotta cladding is a Mario Botta designed pavilion housing Korean antiquity.  All of the permanent collections are substantial in their own right and worth a visit.  Cleverly connected at the entrance via a vast underground lobby, the facility is modern and tryuly world class."
9,5.0,Spectacular collection of all of the Greats in Contemporary art.There is also charming exhibitions of Korean antiquities.
10,3.0,"We went to visit the museum since my husband is an architect. The building is really nice & has an architectural essence that would definitely attract those with an eye of perfectionist and into art. There are 2 exhibition halls to visit. We were too tired to go to all so we just ended up visiting one hall. There were lots to see if you have the time. Our advise is if you want to visit the museum, get there by car since there were a lot of walking uphill & narrow lanes...very near to the Namsan Trekking Trail."
11,4.0,"1) Museum is not so big as it seems. Admission is 10000 won2) Open 10:30–18:00. Usually it's closed on Mondays3) Buildings and space around the museum are one of the main things to look at4) Children are welcome! Koreans love children, so don't be afraid if your kid is loud5) Small and quite expensive cafe, good shop full of stuff made by designers and artists, clean WC, elevators"
12,5.0,"I thought this would be a mostly-modern art-museum but they had amazing historical collections of Korea. We got audio guide and spent more than 3 hours..I didn't have much time and energy left to focus on their modern art but they were really good too! Samsung being so successful, yes they can have whatever they want..many of their colletion was much better than the ones I saw Korea's National Museum. And yes their souvenior shop was..great too."
13,4.0,Great architecture . Great place to spend an afternoon in Seoul. Beautiful collections from the Samsung group. Lovely houses & shops to walk around the museum areas well.
14,5.0,We were given a 1/2 off discount (not sure why!) for all of the exhibits when we went (a Tuesday morning) and we thoroughly enjoyed the art.  Spent about 1.5-2hrs with 4 young kids.  The current special exhibition is awesome (olafur eliasson).  The pottery wing is skipable if you don't care about pottery :)  they are very strict about how you walk through the museum- and our kids made them a bit nervous- but overall it was great!  Kids 7 and under are free.
15,5.0,The museum buildings and landscape are worth mentioning for their artistic styling and interest. Rent an audio guide which syncs up with the exhibits as you wander around looking. The museum is minimalist and easy to navigate. I look forward to my next visit.
16,5.0,"Nice and pleasant art gallary. I usually don't go to art gallary, but I visited here because this art gallary has good reputation. I enjoyed various arts and it was calm and clean. I want to revisit here. I recommend this place."
17,5.0,"You'll be pleasantly surprised at the quality of the collection at this museum. It has a good mix of both western and Korean artists in a well designed modern building. The entrance fee is a modest 10,000 for adults and 6,000 for children. We were able to comfortably view the two main wings in just a little over an hour.The audio tour is very inexpensive and you'll appreciate how it automatically updates based on the work you are standing in front of. The museum is about a 5 to 10 minute walk from the Hangangiin station on the number 6 line. Use exit #1 from the station and head straight. Take the first right and walk up the hill to the museum. You can combine it with a trip to Itaewon on the same subway line."
18,4.0,"We were provided a free visit to the Leeum museum for Samsung employees, so I jumped at the chance. The museum has a variety of artwork from paintings, sculptures, pottery, sketches and metal work. With both historical and modern art fixtures, there is something here for everyone to appreciate. The inclusion of digital guides and interactive displays actually enhance the experience. This is unique because often the inclusion of modern electronic devices takes away from the calm introspective feelings that come from a museum visit. The staff are very friendly, and most understand English, making it a very foreign-friendly place to visit."
19,2.0,"This museum was quite disappointing from what we expected. To start with, the exhibitions in the lobby, were the most interesting. The staff wasn't so friendly. Sort of resembling the old ladies working in the louvre or in a Russian tea pot museum. You are watched all the time by the staff. If you move to look closer on an object, the alarm will sound. Then I'm not really into modern art either. Or I was, but prior to this museum. I mean, there was literally a totally black painting. And it was slightly overpriced as well. But the building was appealing and futuristic and so was the art in the lobby."
20,5.0,Nice Cafe within the building...superb art pieces and of the old and new...wonderful mix..take your time...do not rush through it..worth hiring the digital guide....personalised tour within...a place not to be missed.....
21,5.0,"Came here with my brother and mom who aren't huge fans of art, but we all ended up enjoying it. The space is very clean, modern and the artwork is chosen very well. A great mix of some well known artists in Korea as well as some emerging artists. The place is very tranquil and was a great break on a hot, summer day."
22,5.0,"This is a top-notch art museum you'll encounter in any part of the world. The collection simply exquisite, the ambience pleasant and sleek, and the technology really cool! I loved them all, and one of the highlights of its technological part was the 360 degree image you can see while watching the displayed item. Even if an item is displayed on its own, it's not easy to look both the top and the bottom, if not the front and the back. This technology solved the problem and you can see through magnifying glass as well. So cool!!! The gift shop was nice and my only complaint might be the cafeteria, where I couldn't find a single item that I can eat as someone with gluten, soy, and dairy allergies."
23,5.0,"It is so easy to enjoy a visit to this place as the layout makes it so easy to see it all as the curators intended.  Rather than quantity, they've chosen some of the best examples so yu really feel like every piece is worth a look.  Finally, the audio guide is the best ever as it starts automatically as you approach an object (via sensor in the floor I think) so you walk up and look while info plays in your ear.  If you move on before it finishes, it keeps up."
24,1.0,"1. So many guards - in many areas, there were three times as many guards as visitors.2. Very little depth in the background to the artworks.  There were small placards and a digital guide you can rent for an extra KRW 1000 (about one US dollar).  The placards for each piece have very little or no information about the piece.3. You cannot approach anything - an alarm goes off at about a foot and a half from each piece (50 cm).4. They have a ""children's museum,"" but the children are not permitted to touch anything in the exhibit except for one small workshop area where the children can use a pen to draw something that ends up on a computer.  Not even as good as any typical free app for iOS or Android.  How can you have a children's exhibit and have guards following children around to make sure they don't touch anything?!?5. No photos.  Not even out the windows at the view.  The guards enforce this policy with extreme prejudice.6. Entrance fees were KRW 10000 per person (about $40 for a family of four), and the exhibits are quite disappointing.  The digital guides are another KRW 1000 per person (why not just have QR codes next to the exhibits for you to browse or listen to from your phone?!?).7. The ancient art was OK, but there are better exhibits (see below).  The modern art was pretty crappy and had almost no integrating ideas.  The children's exhibit was particularly barren.As to the exhibits themselves, you are better off going to any normal museum in Seoul, such as the one at Kyeongbokkung Palace.  Apparently, this is the Samsung chaebol's personal holdings, and apparently the daughter lives in the upper floor of the building.  I wonder if this whole thing is some kind of technique to avoid taxes."
25,4.0,"Right in the city with easy access by subway and a short walk to the museum in a residential area.  The museum offers a striking and creative facade.  I liked the audio guide powered by Samsung mobile phones with a specialized application. The digital guided tour was well paced throughout the museum with a well balanced description of each piece on display.  There are 3 different sections, 1 section offering ancient pottery and art, a 2nd section for contemporary art and a 3rd section for child education and culture.  It is a very interesting combination.  There is never a dull moment.  I was treated to interesting displays throughout my 3+ hour visit."
26,5.0,"Small but excellent museum of art, over six floors.  The top floors are Korean traditional art and artefacts.  Our favourite floors were housed the international collection including Andy Warhol, Anish Kapoor, Damien Hirst and Jeff Koon's extraordinary smooth egg with bow sculpture.  Highly recommend"
27,4.0,"Leeum museum is nice and in many countries it would a star but in Seoul it's main advantage is a location. It is very central and one can see a nice art by taking a short stroll, if staying in a central area. Gates of Hell are located right at the entrance and we really liked them. Do not forget to ware goggles provided by the museum. It makes a huge difference."
28,5.0,"Great museum but there is basically no information inside the museum so if you enter without the audioguide, you will just go through the museum with no idea about what you're seeing.The audioguide is just 2000 won and is really great, it's a samsung phone with a lot of info. You can also select a highlights option which will show you a map with the main things to see. And when you arrive in front of a painting or sculpture, the audioguide will automatically start, explaining you what you're seeing. Pretty awesome.The museum itself is really well designed and you will see various pieces, from ancient korean art untill weird modern art. Closed on monday, entrance is 10 000 won."
29,4.0,"Leeum Museum is a quiet oasis near the hectic Itaewon surroundings. It is a cosy space and has a beautiful collection of works of arts, especially of Korean ceramics. The Western collection is not so impressive, except for the huge spider bronze sculpture outdoors, whose author's name I forgot, but belongs to the same series of the one in front of Roppongi Hills in Tokyo. They always have very nice rotationg exchibitions. The architecture is quite pretty and the place is well worth a visit as a welcome respite from the busy activities in the internationalized Itaewon area."
