0,5.0,A liturgical church with many devotees. I had the opportunity to hear the monk’s divine psalms and feel part of the world. It’s an oasis in the daily madness. It’s worth visiting and praying regardless of your religion!!
1,5.0,Jogyesa Temple was one of our first stops on the first full day tour in Seoul. The lotus garden/the pagoda tree and baby Budda were the highlights for me. Our guide Kasey was very accommodating/ and patient while each member of my family made their private wishes while rubbing the famous Pagoda tree n taking pics. It was surprising to find this temple so close to the big city not to mention to lotus garden. This temple was the precursor to  our other temple visits. Because of the size and time of day we only need 30 minutes to tour and hear the history of this temple. Definitely put it on your list if you are in the area.
2,4.0,Came here by accident as I was following my map back to my hotel. The smell of incense and the beautiful buildings made this chance discovery one of the highlights of my stay in Seoul.
3,5.0,Just wow. You must visit. It’s so gorgeous and peaceful. Small so you don’t need long there but the colours are divine.
4,5.0,This temple is located right inbetween officebuildings and daily life - it has 3 majestic buddhas to see and you can catch a ceremony if you are lucky! So go for it.
5,4.0,Must see part of any Seoul tour surrounded by modern tall buildings. A relatively small temple compared to other major temples in Asian cities but still in a nice setting with a peaceful  and reflective atmosphere.
6,4.0,Great tourist attraction taking you back to the Joseon Era! Lovely place to take great photos and to learn about their history.
7,5.0,"I didn’t know what to expect when my friend took me here, it’s beautiful and colourful. I arrived when a service was happening which was really interesting to watch and listen to."
8,4.0,"The main hall looks very nice, both inside and outside. The whole temple was decorated because of Buddha's birthday so it looked great."
9,4.0,"There were numerous lanterns handing with papers from them. It is a small temple grounds but still has much to offer. They still had prayer areas, theater, shop, cafeteria, and a few other things. Like many other reviewers, I have been to larger temples but do not compare temples due to size. The colors on the temple make it more than worth the trip. Despite its size, it is one of the most important temples in Korea for Buddhism."
10,5.0,"It's a pretty small temple, not much to explore, but it's so worth the visit. Inside the main temple building you can see 3 big golden statues of Buddha (pay attention on where you should take off your shoes). Yet, it's most worth visit on around the end of April, during May, and beginning of June (around the date of Buddha's birthday), since they decorated the whole temple with the most festive looking lanterns! Guaranteed to take the most mesmerizing pictures!"
11,4.0,"If you find yourself in downtown Seoul and want to see a Buddhist temple, this one is your obvious, maybe only, choice. In my opinion you can find much nicer temples in the Korean countryside, but for those with only time in Seoul this is the temple you will find most easily. I like the concrete Buddha statue next to the main building the most."
12,5.0,It's a very serene temple with amazing interiors. There was a large prayer going on when we went there. The giant Buddha statues inside leave one with pure awe. The grounds of the temple were very well decorated.
13,5.0,"come with our friends before flying out the country to try out new working experience . it is must do / it is very nice and beautiful Budha , the garden is amazing and the temple have very well setting and great design with High Architecture"
14,5.0,"For first time visitor if u wanna have a glimpse of the Buddhist religion for the South Koreans, this temple is a highly recommended venue to visit. A very sacred place with locals saying prayers in their offerings to the golden buddha statues. A thumbs up!"
15,5.0,"We happened to find this little gem on our walk around town. The first thing that hit us was the overwhelming smell of flowers. The area is covered in small pots of flowers donated by people. Surprisingly it was very quiet considering how close to the streets it was. When services are going on, do not enter the main temple without removing your shoes and avoid snapping photos during this time out of respect."
16,4.0,Visit at night to see the gardens lit up and lanterns on display - a magical wonderland! Only needs 1/2 hour tops so check out on the way to / from shopping and dining in Insadong.
17,5.0,We were lucky enough to be here for the annual flower festival and it was amazing. (late October). This can be a quick stop visit if you need filler in your schedule. Worth seeing!
18,5.0,"Yes that's what hit me first, the abundance of colour. Beautiful flowers outside the teample that were so delightful and welcoming."
19,4.0,"We came across this by chance when visiting Insadong Street (also well worth a visit!) and were charmed by the lush display of flowers surrounding many Buddhas at the temple. Very busy, but a calm and peaceful atmosphere."
20,5.0,"We discovered the temple by chance, but, by all means, try to go there if you are close. Situated in the city center, easy to reach."
21,4.0,"This is a nice temple in seoul  i loved visit tempels, every temple is special in it's own way. this one you should do if you are in insadong"
22,5.0,"I always pass by and take a walk around the temple when I visit to Seoul combine with walking through Insadong. Beautiful Buddhist temple in the middle of city center with trees and flowers, this time exhibition of lotus flowers in the square. Take a break and enjoy."
23,3.0,"This temple is in the middle of Insadong.  It's easy to find and small in terms of the grounds.  We found it on the way from Gyeongbukgong Palace to Insadong shopping area.  There are good photo ops and you can pray there, but that's about it."
24,5.0,"also very peaceful considering it is in the middle of the city.  I walked here and the surroundings were beautiful.  A lot of nature in the midst of a busy city like Seoul.  Also across the street is a church that serves a vegan meal buffet, Amazing in case you are around this area, go eat across the street"
25,4.0,I have always been amazed of the Buddha and the blessings it can bestow to people that prays and believes. We went there and the place is so crowded but you can still feel the serenity of the place.
26,4.0,"A Buddhist temple with many people going here to worship, flickering candles, paper lanterns, the gold Buddha's all add to the atmosphere."
27,5.0,A place of calm to allow a break from the bustle around.We enjoyed a calm hour in the middle of the day just walking around the temple surrounds.
28,5.0,"I love Korean temples in general but Jogyesa is really good about all year activities. They have lotus flower festival, Buddha birthday celebrations, English speaking staff and of course temple is amazingly pretty! It's so easy to find it and you don't have to climb any mountain to get there. Exactly in the middle of Seoul!"
29,4.0,"After exploring the palaces near our hotel, on our way back we saw this temple, located just along the street. At first we hesitated to enter, but it has a very inviting ambiance. The temple is huge, quite and relaxing despite of having a number worshipers on that day. The decorations on the ceiling are bright and colorful. It has sculptures in the area. This place is has free entrance fee and no dress code. We enjoyed touring around the temple and was fascinated with its decorations. It was indeed a great unexpected finding! One of the benefits of walking."
30,2.0,"Not particularly a Buddhist myself, I would not recommend any tourists going out of their way if only to visit this temple. As it isn't particularly unique compared to temples in China (and this one is quite small), you should only pass through this temple if you're coming through from Anguk station, through Insadong, the temple then perhaps making your way to Geonggbukgong temple.As it is a temple, you will need to be a bit more respectful. Eg: going into the main temple with 3 gold Buddha's, you will need to take off your shoes and maintain peace and quiet. I would not recommend taking photos here due to the nature of this place. Outside, where there is a pavilion/tower, if there is a Buddhist conducting prayer, they may be chanting whilst circling round the pagoda. It may be a good idea to ensure you're not in their way. Despite all that, if you're interested in writing out your prayer/wishes, visit the tourist information office near the gates where you may take one of the wishes card to write your wishes on. Right next to the gate, you will be able to hang your wish card and also take a postcard back home as souvenir.All in all, a quick visit that may not take you more than 30 minutes if you can navigate your way. (Recommend you downloading the Navermap app as it took us everywhere we wanted easily)"
31,5.0,This temple’s design every autumn is very beautiful. It never fails to amaze me every year. This year the design was for autumn flowers in the shape of tulip. How was that? You don’t need to pay to enter Jogyesa. It accessible when you are already in Insadong - a place to find and buy traditional culture and crafts.  Please enjoy the beautiful pictures.
32,5.0,"Love to visit while I am staying in Seoul.  A peaceful and respectful spot.  Please see my previous review for exactly how to get to Jogyesa.  Also tip for wheelchairs.  No major exhibition going on this trip and no major flower presentation, but a calming and stress free stay.  It is free to enter."
33,4.0,"They keep changing its decoration every season. Couple of years they were full of chrysanthemums in fall, so I took my friends this afternoon. Today, I found the main four heroes in the journey to the West(西遊記). They are surrounded by pretty chrysanthemums. Good to visit!"
34,5.0,"Small temple with a difference. Plenty of flowers and lanterns, still rather peaceful. Bought some black sticky rice with brown powdery covering from the Korean lady - like a sweet and very tasty."
35,4.0,This Buddhist temple is a must visit. Its situated right in the middle of city hustle bustle . The most striking feature for me was its magnificent lotus garden. Just fell in love at the first sight with these flowers. Past the garden u reach the temple gate where one can offer prayers and sit for a while. Adjacent to the temple is a small souvenir shop with beautiful collection of candles and bells.
36,2.0,"I love visiting temples, and I took a trip to Japan earlier in the year visiting a lot of temples and shrines and fell in love with them - I was disappointed with the size of this temple and it is situated in not the nicest area. I would suggest visiting Gyeongbokgung palace and missing this out if you're rushed for time."
37,5.0,"Conveniently located in between Jonggak and Anguk station, just opposite the Templestay information centre. I'm sure this place is not unfamiliar to many. The main temple every year during Buddha Day events. There's a vegetarian food fair during Buddha Day period too. The famous vegetarian restaurant Balwoo Gongyang - 발우공양 is located in the Templestay information centre building too."
38,3.0,"I fins this place alright. I saw many koreans praying at the 3 buddhas. There were some nice lanterns. But I think it is worth an hour, at most since there is nothign much to see. I think it's meant for worship rather than for tourists."
39,3.0,A typical Chinese temple. I and my friends joined in a worshipping ceremony and experienced some peaceful moments.
40,3.0,I have seen better. Maybe we went here at the temple's most bland days. There was nothing much to see. Didn't even see a single lantern..
41,5.0,"We ran into this temple while venturing around the busy walking street of Insadong. Nestled right between the palace and the busy walkway, Jogyesa radiates with colorful lanterns, enormous Buddhas, and meditating locals. Despite its enormous size, Jogyesa is quiet - it's the perfect place to rest your feet or take a break from the busyness of Seoul."
42,5.0,What a beautiful Buddhist temple. We were lucky to visit during the celebration of Buddha birth as the temple was covered in colorful lanterns. Remember to hug the 400 year old tree for good luck.
43,5.0,We visited at night time in May and there were thousands of colorful lanterns for Buddha's birthday. Beautiful! Recommended.
44,5.0,"Magical place in the heart of Seoul, the multicolor lanterns make this temple an incredible place to visit at whatever season."
45,5.0,"There was ceremony there, so we heard nice voices singing. The temple was full of people. The interior is beautiful as well."
46,5.0,"We were there the day before Buddha's birthday, filled with brightly colored lanterns, and lots of monks.  We got to see the ceremony of bathing baby Buddha. They fill a ladle and pour water over the small buddha statue 3 times., 1 wash to eliminate all evil thoughts, 2 to cultivate good deals and 3rd wash to save all living beings,"
47,5.0,"I went on May 3, 2017 for the Buddha's Birthday. Though there were thousands of people, I really enjoyed myself. Seeing all the beautiful colorful lanterns hung above our heads; the performance, and cultural events on the side was fun. Jogyesa is also minutes away from Insadong and walking distance to Cheonggychon and Myeongdong. If in the area, I would recommend to visit."
48,5.0,"A very beautiful & sacred place Kind of relax and quite , everybody is worshiping and doing what they believeThere is some kind of misterIous energy around :) I liked it very much"
49,5.0,"This temple is a stunningly lovely example of the architecture, design, decoration and care put into a worship site for  practitioners of Korean Buddhism. Glory in the beauty both inside & outside. Inside, do take care not to disturb the practitioners as they worship. Absolutely worth a stop, you need perhaps 15-20 minutes in total to view everything."
50,4.0,"I was greeted by three wonderful, friendly ladies serving hot tea which I really appreciated on the chilly, rainy day that I was there. The multi-colored paper lanterns fluttered in the breeze. I was able to observe the Buddhist service taking place in the temple, and look at the other buildings on these grounds."
51,3.0,Visited it on my way .. and it was fantastic. . Although small.. there are many bigger temples than this one ..No entrance fee.. there is information Center specially designed for tourists
52,4.0,Small temple but many people prayer there and my tourist too. Beautiful place n located at city centre.

55,4.0,"Big compound. Working temple, worshippers in meditation Beautiful period architectureNice to walk around - 20 minutes in temple is enough"
56,5.0,"I visited this temple as part of an evening tour I took around Seoul. We spent about 15 minutes walking the grounds. The properly around the temple was decorated with thousands of mums in many different types of arrangements including tunnels, trees, and altar shapes. The central temple (we did not go in as a service was in progress) was enormous and beautiful from the outside. Through the windows we could see the worshipers and the enormous Buddha statues inside. A beautiful lantern illuminated tree was also on the property. I assume some of the decorations were seasonal but some of them are permanent. No matter your religious beliefs, or lack there-of, you will still find peace in this place just by visiting."
57,5.0,"The temple is beautiful at night with illuminated flower beds. The 3 large buddha statues are impressive . The buildings are old korean style ,as are the surrounding buildings."
58,4.0,"This is quite a striking and tranquil temple in the heart of Seoul. It is also an important temple in Korean Buddhism.The gardens are very nice complete with an ancient tree.There are numerous, colourful and artistic floral tributes."
59,5.0,"It's amazing both inside and outside, and it also gives you a break from the city. Really recommend it!"
60,4.0,"This place is a temple near the palace in seoul. In the tempel, it‘s decoration by a lot of flower and tree. The admission for enter this place is free."
61,5.0,"I happened upon this temple, seeing all the people milling all around.  Inside the buildings it is beautiful and peaceful."
62,5.0,I absolutely loved this temple!! I would definitely say it's even better than the palaces. Didn't make it to the other temples but this one was great!!
63,4.0,"good place for take a photos and walk around to see a different religion and culture ,the people there very friendly ,I was in this place at night during worshiping time so we step out the main place the  Buddhist place because the police man told us to don't take a photo inside the place , so we just hang around ,this place need 1 -2 hours to visit it"
64,4.0,"The temple itself was very nice. It was very hot and humid and hard to spend too much time outside that day. Cooled down in the gift shop, there were tons of beautiful bracelets. I love the one I picked out, but would have loved to purchase even more, if I had a bigger budget."
65,5.0,"Love to visit this temple, the oldest Buddhist temple in Seoul.  This trip, not much in celebrations taking place as has been the case on previous visits, but always there is a good feeling walking around, watching the people praying, lighting candles, and refreshing there souls in a relaxing and calming atmosphere.  Please see my previous reviews for directions, locations and more info.  Entrance on the Main Street has many steps, but if you take the alley just before, and enter from the side, or from the museum side, there is flatter ground for wheelchair access.  Right near Insadong-gil so easy to reach."
66,5.0,"While I am not Buddhist, it was still an awesome experience to take some time and visit this temple.  Very easy access as it is in the middle of a bustling touristy district but also very quiet for being in such a place.  Take some time to walk around, observe the people and enjoy the quiet.  It really adds to your understanding of the people, the city and the different cultures you experience while traveling abroad.  The colored lanterns seem to only be up during the Month of May to celebrate Buddah's Birthday but the temple is still worth a visit any time of year.  It is so close to Insadong shopping area and Gyeongbukgong Palace that it is very easy to jump over for a visit!"
67,5.0,"There s a gentlemen at the visitors center who does tours in English. Although we did not do a tour, he spoke to us about the history of the temple and was very friendly and helpful."
68,4.0,"Breathtaking! We're just strolling around at Insadong and found this temple. We didn't expect much, but this place just wow us. Peaceful and colorful. Is a good place to sit down and relax"
69,4.0,"Easily accessible as it is within close proximity to cheongyechon and insadong food street. There are so many lanterns of varying colours hanging above which make it a stunningly photogenic view. 2 words: ""Beautiful"" & ""Peaceful""."
70,5.0,"Came during the celebration of Buddha's birthday, very beautiful temple!  Beautiful gold Buddha's in the alter area.  Free to walk in and participate in prayer, if you like, or just watch.  Not too far from Gyeongbokgung or Insa-dong if I remember correctly. One of my favorite sites on my visit to Seoul!"
71,4.0,"We went there on may 7 th 2016. there are holding lotus lantern festival, the streets all full with beautiful lantern, very beautiful festival with many people and countries are participating."
72,4.0,After seeing Buddhist temples in China and Tahiland I was not impressed with this one. It's nice if you have never seen any but nothing really amazing
73,4.0,"I personally felt overwhelmed in this place, I did not go inside as there was a worship session taking place at the moment i arrived. Buda images are really impressive."
74,4.0,"Buddhism seems to make people friendly, and lets them speak English better - may I add. We met super nice folks there and loved the layout and the nighlty illumination."
75,4.0,"The temple is located in one of the busiest streets in In-Sa-Dong. We stopped by as one of our group suggested who was a Buddhist. Once you walk in you'd feel calm and peaceful in no time. Couldn't stay long because of our rough schedule, but we truly enjoyed:)"
76,5.0,"recommending, nice place to visit, save at least 2 hours, not so crowded as some others temples, lovely gardening as well"
77,4.0,"Contrary  to the reconstructed palaces that serve just a reminder of the old past, this temple is alive and thriving with spiritual life. Certainly worth visiting"
78,4.0,"We got a pleasant surprise when we visited the temple. I have been to quite a few temples in Korea, but none of them showcased flowers the way Jogyesa does. Autumn is the season for Chrysanthemums, and the whole temple is adorned with them. It was a cold, gloomy and wet morning when we went, the colorful and lively flowers glistened and sparkled in the rain, made us cheerful and excited. The temple itself is full of morning praying visitors, and this added serenity to the whole temple. The friendly temple volunteer at the information center welcomed us with hot tea, and taught us to do a simple lotus flower using paper cups and Korean paper."
79,5.0,"We were at the Buddhist vegetarian restaurant across the street, and decided to visit this temple.  It was so beautiful - the grounds had so many pretty flowers ... it was amazing.  I have never seen any place quite like this."
80,3.0,"There is a lot to see in this area but the temple itself is small. Definitely go if you are near by (Gyeongbokgung palace, Gwanghwamun square). Covered in flowers and very pretty but only took 10 minutes as we went past."
81,5.0,"another hidden gem right in the midst of downtown Seoul.  Lively look at Buddhism.  Inspiring and special place.  The architecture, the deity figures, the lotus flowers blooming in the courtyard are all special"
82,5.0,I don't think you can travel to Seoul without seeing some local history. These temple are beautiful  it is crowed but work going to any temple to view and see different cultures
83,3.0,A beautiful temple that we stopped by to visit on our Seoul City Tour. It was beautifully landscaped with many flowers! One of the most important Korean Temples with the largest Buddha shrine in Seoul. It was an easy stop.
84,4.0,The location of the temple is very nice with nice lanterns decoration. The temple is small with a lot of people. Nice to walk around and view the area
85,5.0,I really liked this temple because it had a nice central location in Seoul and was impressive with the Buddha statues.  It's free to look around and you can spend 30 minutes to an hour taking pictures before moving on to the next site.
86,4.0,This temple just seems like it belongs in the middle of Seoul. Something about it  seems so natural and calming. Really worth a stop during your busy day for some quiet reflection and to bring you back into the moment. The golden buddhas are stunning and the coloured painting on the outside of the temple is really unique to Korean buddhism. No photos inside the temple.
87,3.0,"We visited a week before Buddha's birthday, the place is very festive. Colorful lights and lanterns hang outside the temple. The temple is small but interesting, it is also nice to visit temples and learn how people pray and how do they practice their religion. The 3 Buddha's inside are temple are really big and beautiful."
88,4.0,"I just came across this temple. It's located in the center of the seoul. When I visited on May 1st, there were many colorful lanterns up above. My friends told you'll see the view only on May."
89,4.0,"Ok after visiting so many temples I'm always interested in what is different. In late March or early April they have some kind of lantern festival. There's are super cool and colourful, defiantly worthwhile."
90,4.0,"Even if you are not into Buddhism, this place still worth visiting when you are in the town. The huge buddha statute inside of the main building, people studying and praying in front of it, the pretty garden, and the architecture...i can't list all."
91,4.0,"A sacred Buddhist temple. Although tourist are welcome, you are expected to observe silence because a lot of people are praying. An english speaking guide can explain to you about the temple at no cost. Cameras are not allowed inside but you can take pictures from outside."
92,5.0,Entrancing chants.  Beautiful flowers at the chrysanthemum festival!  Loved seeing tranquil setting in such a busy city!
93,4.0,"If you have spare time, you can visit this temple.  It an ordinary temple with no distinct feature except for the three huge Buddhas.  It is located in the city of Jongno-gu, Seoul, that is why you can add it to your itinerary.  However, if you already included Bongeunsa in your itinerary, you need not go here."
94,4.0,small temple but definitely worth visiting if you're walking around downtown. You can see colorful lanterns outside the temple.Drop by the souvenir shop and you will see very nice bracelets...
95,3.0,"No, this is not the most elaborate or massive temple you will find; but what struck me was the fact that it exists at all. Seoul is a bustling metropolis where every square inch of real estate is put to use; so, it was nice to see that this sacred ground had not been desecrated to build a high-rise or hotel.The first thing you will notice is the rainbow of colorful lanterns that shades the entire temple area.  I've heard some people saying these are being taken down - I'm not sure if that's to put new ones up or because fall is coming, but if you can get their in time to see them you won't be disappointed.  They're beautiful!There is a 300+ year old Chinese ""scholar tree"" that shades a large portion of the temple's courtyard; which is pretty incredible.  While we were there, the monks were leading people in chants and prayers.  Incense was burning, and it was magical.  I'm a Christian, but I still enjoyed this peaceful little stop on our way to Insa-Dong (this temple is within walking distance of Anguk Station, Insa-Dong, and Gyeonbokgung Palace).  I highly recommend taking a break from site-seeing to relax for a moment in these serene surroundings."
96,4.0,"one of the most important temples in seoul, particularly nice around holidays and a peaceful retreat from the hussle and bussle"
97,5.0,"If you are in the Insadong area or even if not, this a great place to visit.  It is not a large area, like some of the palaces you might visit, but rather an Old Buddhist Temple.  Please see my previous review for more details about the temple.  But every time I visit, they are decorated for a different theme.  Last time a huge flower and plant exhibit was presented.  This time a lantern festival.  There were literally hundreds if not a thousand colorful lanterns hanging over the entire grounds, side by side, one after the other.  It was literally a roof of brightly colored lanterns.  A wonderful sight.  There is no admission to the temple.  The huge Buddha statutes are spectacular.  See my previous review from more info and directions."
98,4.0,"I went to the temple in the morning, while the people was actually doing the prayer. The chanting felt so surreal. Hands down, it is indeed a very beautiful temple. check the prayer time before going so that you can enter the temple itself. I just got to witness from the outside."
99,4.0,The temple is well kept and pretty! Nice get away from the busy city of Seoul. In a good location to other tourist spots so a must see if in the area.
100,5.0,"We were incredibly luck to be able to visit Jogyesa 2 days before Buddha's birthday and shortly after the lantern festival where some of the floats that were on the water were there in person. The lantern colors and design was mesmerizing and we got to experience a 15min buddhist prayer session which is a once in a lifetime experience. Also, the head monk was out talking to folks and offered to take a picture which was also a great memory we will never forget. They have a temple experience where I think you can stay and experience if it you are interested. Otherwise, it is a great place to stop in, people watch, pay respects and it will only take you about an hour or less."
101,3.0,You can skip this place and go visit other temples.  Its small and very very busy and i just like my temples serene.
102,5.0,"I have to say that I was completely blown away upon entering into the outside gates. The gardens of the grounds and the flowers are so vibrant and intricately manicured. The inside of the temple has one of the lightest energies to it and is beautiful to even just sit quietly in.My favorite was the gift shop as there were tons upon tons of trinkets from various types of temple incense to protective jewelry sold... that jewelry shop literally has something for everyone, even if spirituality isn't their thing."
103,4.0,...just a short walk from insadong. Smaller than anticipated but gorgeous all the same. Notice how the whole temple is water-themed
104,4.0,Surrounding is relaxed despite the city center location. An information center and stores for souvenirs or food are available. Intricate hand painted design on the walls and ceilings are noticeable. Colorful lotus lanterns are displayed in their doors. The temple has three huge Golden Buddha. Guests are allowed to enter the temple even during their worship.  You are requested to take off your shoes. Visiting the temple is worthwhile.
