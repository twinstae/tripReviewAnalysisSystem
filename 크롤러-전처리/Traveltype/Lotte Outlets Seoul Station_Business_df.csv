0,4.0,"I could not access my stop [City Hall] because of the Pope's appearance, so I got off the subway at Seoul Central to walk to my hotel, and there was Lotte Outlets. My guess is a good number of the items here are seasonal clearance from the massive Lotte stores. Some maybe brands that live here at the Outlet. Now, Department stures in Seoul are massive and breathtakingly expensive. All Lacoste and Polo tennis shirts are well over $100. But, at the Outlets, prices are more reasonable. They had a great selection of Le Coq Sportif [French] tennis and t-shirts for $20 to $50 dollars. The seasonal reductions on North Face were causing a minor mob scene. I was in and out in well under an hour but it was fun and lots better than going to the main line, expensive department stores."
