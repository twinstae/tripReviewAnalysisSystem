0,4.0,"I leave the Exit 2 of Hyehwa Station (420) and go to the east on the way of the MarronnierPark side. Because I go up the scarp, shoes comfortable to walk in are necessary.Just walk along the road, it is possible to see the famous Art such as flowers of stairs.There are guide plates here and there. When there is the mural you want to see, particularly you have no time, you can look for it in pinpoint.However, to stroll in the old residential area is fun. You may find an unexpected wonderful picture on the wall of the house when you go through the small alley. Let's enjoy stroll."
1,4.0,"I visited in late May 2015 with husband and parents-in-law. I didn't know it was on top of a hill, so required quite a bit of walking and climbing from the subway station... My parents-in-law are in their 60s and in good physical shape, but it was still tiring for them. So I recommend taking a taxi to Yulgok-ro 19-gil (see map attached) if you're going with older folks.This is a popular place for young locals (many are here with selfie sticks and are obviously here on a date), but can get quite crowded with tourists. When I visited around 4pm, a small Chinese tour group arrived, so that created a bit of a wait for the major murals, but luckily for us, we were already moving on. The area is also just really nice for a walk, if you don't mind climbing up and down some stairs."
2,5.0,"Took Line 4 until Hyehwa station, and walked up the hill after exit 2. It was autumn when I was here - spent a few hours waiting for evening sun around 4 or 5-ish to shine through this place - definitely worth the wait for pictures!! A lot of wall paintings around the neighbourhood. Isn't many cafes/restaurants here though. Good thing is that the park is free - would come here again for relaxation and pictures"
