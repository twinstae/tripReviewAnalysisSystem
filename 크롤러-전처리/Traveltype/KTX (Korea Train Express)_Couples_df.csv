0,3.0,"Compare to Japanese train, KTX has room for improvement.  Luggage space is limited, toilet are not clean."
1,5.0,"If you don‚Äôt like long lines at the airport and all the chaos then I highly recommend taking the KTX Train around Korea. It‚Äôs convenient, fast, clean and comfortable and priced just right. KTX is always my first choice ‚ù§Ô∏èüöÑ"
2,4.0,Time taken to travel from one place to another was very fast! Pressure keeps building up in my ears. Instructions were clear. Information on train tickets and at railway stations are easy to understand for english. Train rides are very quiet despite being full. Some places need to book tickets earlier as they run out of seats e.g. from jeonju to busan (through osong) and trains from yongsan to jeonju. Some time slots were already fully booked when we tried to book about 4 days in advance.
3,4.0,"Booked the ticket online for Busan to Seoul sector, well in advance. The process was smooth as there were instructions in English. The train was punctual and the compartment was neat and clean. You can pick up packed food from counters at the station. There is a place at the entry point of the compartment where you can store your luggage"
4,5.0,"We took the KTX from Daegu to Seoul, but this time the one that made several local stops. It took 1 hour and 45‚Äô, but better to take the non-stop that takes only 1 hour and 15‚Äô. It is definitely faster than regular train and bus."
5,4.0,We used the KTX a couple of times and in overall very satisfied with it. Be aware that if you try to get a last minute tickets you might not find it on rush hour.
6,4.0,"Very efficient way to travel through Korea ,fast and very punctual.Very fast loading of passengers."
7,5.0,"My previous opinion hasn't altered.KTX remains terrific and the best way to see South Korea internally.Buy a KORAIL pass and soak up teh savings, plus upgrade to 1st class 2 plus 1 seating and free snacks for about KRW15000 extra one way Busan to Seoul.My train on that route was 18 cars and full capacity about 1870 passengers.  Heaps join enroute on the stopping trains.it's essential to reserve seats in advance.Stations have lots of food and shopping options, and are clean."
8,5.0,"Foreigners are able to buy a variety of travel pass options.Check your travel plans to see if it's cost effective or just buy tickets as required.Trains were amazing. Clean, punctual to the minute."
9,4.0,We got the train in the evening down to Busan. Getting to the tracks was fine in Seoul station and getting tickets was easy. Actually it would have been cheaper and less time to get a plane but the timings didn‚Äôt work! We were glad though we got to experience Korean train journey! The seats were comfortable in first class and we were given a small snack (a cake and some nuts). Comfortable journey.
10,4.0,We had the earliest train! I really liked that it wasn't crowded. KTX is on time and clean. What i didn't like was that the tv was quite loud and it didn't have airco
11,5.0,"Clean, spacious,  easy to book and very comfortable seats . All that you need to travel from  City to City. Can highly recommend."
12,4.0,"This is so nice. Just book your train and seats in their portal, you can easily change your tickets and get a refund in case you made a mistake or just want another train, trains are very clean and always in time. Staff shows big respect for their clients. Example for the rest of the world. And there you go, with 300km an hour, as fast as a F1 car."
13,5.0,"What a fast and efficient service, we could learn a lot from the way that they run their transport system. It got up to 300 per hour, which was a delight"
14,5.0,"Find your car# and then your seat within the car. From Seoul to Busan seats 9-16 are forward facing and 1-8 are backwards facing. From Busan to Seoul seats 1-8 are forward facing and 9-16 are backwards facing. Easy and comfortable way to get between these 2 cities. Get to the platform 30 mins early if you have big luggage and stow in between each car. Book tickets online at LetsKorail.com. If you get a seat facing backwards, just refresh the browser/restart the process again so a new seat# is assigned. To get a non-stop train, check the times to make sure that the train travel time is 2.5 hours. The stops don‚Äôt really add much time though and it‚Äôs still quick and efficient."
15,4.0,"it was like any other train, much faster that the other local trains. expectation was of a super fast train but this was not even close."
16,5.0,"We traveled from Busan to Seoul. Our first class seats were comfortable. Though we had the help of local friends, the process of checking in and finding the right location seemed easy. We were hoping to see a lot of the countryside, but we quickly discovered that South Korea is a nation of tunnels, and much of the ride is inside tunnels."
17,3.0,"Taking the train from Seoul to Busan now.After having taken 6 trips on China's High Speed train, this Korean train is certainly not a high speed train. It is just a normal train with limited stops. Trains are a bit dated although the cabin is clean. But toilet outdated. Average speed is about 100 kmp. A bullet train speed in China is between 200 to 310. So don't be mistaken the KTX for a bullet train."
18,5.0,"I love traveling by train and our experience on KTX was exceptional.  We traveled from Seoul to Busan in southern South Korea and it was a dream.  The train was inexpensive, fast and clean...I would rate this above any airline any day of the week.  You get to see the countryside and relax in comfort with your assigned seat...a terrific way to travel."
19,3.0,"I've struggled to book a ticket online from the US (east coast) as the website kept throwing reservation errors. It turns the transactions only go through during Korean business hours. If anyone else had this problem, simply wait until it's late (like midnight).  But you will not be able to choose your seat."
20,5.0,Quick clean fast and comfortable and only 41 minutes from the city centre and at around ¬£6.00 per journey it‚Äôs a real winner
21,5.0,"It was a toss up about traveling from Busan to Seoul. Glad at chose Korail KTX.I was but certain about booking online so went to Busan station to book the tickets 2 days ahead of the journey. Short queue, questions answered, train selected.I chose the 935 am train, economy class. Cost me about usd 63 for the trip. 2 tickets issued by a printer and charged to credit card.  Couldn't be simpler.  Coach number and seat number assigned. Arrived half hour before the departure time. Checked out the track number. Mine was track 6.15 min before the, an announcement was made to go in. Do check the lighted signboards.Walked to coach 15, boarded and relaxes for the 2 1/2 hr trip. No one e checked my tickets.Smooth ride all the way.Highly recommended."
22,5.0,We took this train twice from Seoul to Busan and Busan to Seoul. It‚Äôs nice to have WiFi in the train and charging points since it‚Äôs around a 2 hour trip. The train is not new but it‚Äôs in acceptable condition.
23,5.0,We use this train to go to & fro Seoul - Busan. Its really fast which only using 2h30m for a distance of 329km to travel to the destination. The train is clean and comfortable. Highly recommended if u wanna travel to busan or Seoul for sight-seeing view.
24,3.0,"We had a pretty bad experience taking the KTX train from Seoul to Busan. We did some research prior to our trip to Seoul and all reviews said there were multiple and regular trains to Busan. When we reached Seoul Station at around 1 pm, we were told by the counter staff that the next available direct train was at 5 pm plus. As we did not wish to waste our time (4 over hours) waiting for that train, we took the next offer to go on another train departing at 2.45 pm but there were NO seats left and we have to stand all the way to Busan and there were 6 stops before it reached our final destination. The worse nightmare in the train was that there were actually NO standing space. We have to stand outside the toilet and or near the space for putting the lugguages. Besides us, there were also others standing around too. One guy literally sat on top of the toilet seat throughout the journey when nobody used the toilet! üôÑLesson learnt: make sure to buy the ticket online prior to your trip if you wish to take the train to other cities in South Korea. The reason why we did not buy the tickets prior to our flying there was, we read a number of reviews and all these reviewers said there will be NO hassle getting the train tickets upon arrival in Seoul! That is definitely incorrect information! PLEASE REMEMBER to buy the tickets online from Korail‚Äôa website prior to your trip!"
25,4.0,"We have used the KTX six times now, always between Seoul and Daejeon, which is an hour out of Seoul on the Seoul to Busan line.Tickets can be booked online, where you can select an English language version of the website and it it VITAL to pre-book, well in advance, because trains fill up.  Bizarrely, once booked, you are unlikely to be asked for your ticket as KTX employees patrol the carriages making a note of occupied seats, hence, as long as you have a ticket and are sitting in the correct seat, you are fine.Seats are comfortable, in pairs, although there is an option when booking to request a group of four with a table between - few in number, very popular and sell out quickly.  You have a foot rest and a lap table which folds away into the back of the seat in front.  There are toilets in each carriage, together with mother and baby  facilities, and we have been given bottles of water by staff asking through the carriage, although not on every occasion.Etiquette on the train, of which you will view various videos on the subject on the overhead screens in the carriage, is that passengers are quiet whilst the train is in motion.Announcements regarding the next station are given about five minutes in advance.  The train does not stand in any station for very long, so you do need to be prepared. Announcements are given in Korean and English.There are luggage racks overhead, but these are only really suitable for hand luggage.  If, like us, you are catching the KTX after a long haul flight and have large suitcases, you will need to store them in the luggage area by the doors of the carriage and this is my biggest gripe with the KTX trains - they are sadly lacking in luggage storage for large pieces, which is unusual for a service which is running outwards from the capital city.  The step up and down into the carriage is also high and steep and requires some effort with a large suitcase, although the Korean people are exceedingly polite and helpful and I have had many incidences of help with getting on and off trains.When arriving at Seoul station and potentially progressing onto the metro system, you will also find that it is not always user friendly for those with heavy luggage, with stairs being the only option at some stations and some quite lengthy walks between stations.Because of this, we are planning to use the bus in future.  But, if you aren‚Äôt loaded down with luggage and are young and fit and strong, then this is an excellent way to fan out from Seoul to the regions of Korea."
26,5.0,"KTX is an excellent option if you are traveling in Korea served by this rail line. Super clean, efficient reservation system, free wi/fi, overhead t.v., quiet and fast. Busan to Seoul in 2.5 hours! Of course you will pay for this privilege but it is well worth it. Great value for the money."
27,5.0,"Get to Nami Island from Seoul and return is fast using this one, just have to know where to find it because it only found at particular station"
28,4.0,"A comfortable ride, although not as fast as you would expect or as hyped (not as fast as Shinkansen). Coach seats are comfortable and the view from the windows is good. Limited food and drink on board (just a few vending machines), so bring your own (lots of choices in the station). Arrive early to avoid the last minute rush of boarding the train, especially if you have large luggage over 21 inches. As seats are reserved, pretty much exclusively, buy on-line ahead of time. Note that KTX website in English can be frustrating and make sure to read the entire page before submitting. View out the windows is good, but your neighbors may put the shades down and block your view. Train was clean and well maintained."
29,5.0,The KTX was a great way for us to get from the airport to our destination and back at the end of our trip! Easy to navigate and enjoyable and clean.
30,4.0,"We traveled round trip from Seoul to Gyeongju by KTX train. The KTX Train was timely and and priced reasonably. The cost was about 50-60 USD per person for economy and took about 2 to 2 1/2 hours each way to travel the 275  to 280 km. The ride was comfortable, the seats were similar to economy class by air with more room. There is also space for luggage. The KTX trains are designed to provide timely transportation and they do. The KTX car was was one of 18 on our train, the passenger compartments were a comfortable temperature and there is no smoking, both of these features were appreciated. Having never ridden a ‚Äúbullet‚Äù train we were pleased that neither acceleration nor deceleration was too noticeable. The train did not have a dining car so if you wish food or drinks you need to bring your own. Lastly the KTX train‚Äôs have many convenient  terminal locations . Met our desires as transportation and was uneventful in a good way."
31,5.0,"Its very efficient and comfortable, but we suggest you book online in advance if you are expecting a long trip so you don't go through standing."
32,5.0,"I purchased a KTX ticket to Busan from Seoul Station a few days prior. The tickets are fairly expensive, but in the end the ride was quick and convenient. I arrived at the platform about 15 minutes before departure and the train left on time. It was about a two hour, give or take, ride to Busan. The train was quiet, smooth, spacious, and comfortable. Overall, great experience!"
33,5.0,"We used KTX trains to travel from Seoul to Jeonju, Gyeongju and Busan. The KTX network is fantastic! The tickets are relatively cheap, much cheaper than Japan's high speed trains. The trains are so fast and smooth with comfy seats, travelling is a pleasure instead of a chore."
34,5.0,"KTX is the Korean version of Japan's bullet train that whizzes you around Korea at speeds over 300 kph. Our journey from Seoul to Pusan took just over 2.5 hours which was far quicker than flying, considering we didn't need to get out to the airport or check in early. The carriages were clean and the seats comfortable."
35,5.0,The KTX is a fast and efficient way to go to Seoul from the airport and vice versa. The seats are very comfortable and there are plenty of space to put your luggage.
36,5.0,I enjoyed using the KTX to go from Seoul to Daegu.  It was a quick 2-hour ride in a clean and peaceful train car.  Will do every chance.
37,4.0,Comfortable.  Clean.  On time.  Limited staff.  Easy to use. Efficient.I would use the train system again.  Overall a good experience.  We traveled from Busan to Seoul with no issues.
38,4.0,"Train on time slightly expensive, Seating arrangement is not realy spacious. Overall the distance is not far so its ok."
39,4.0,"Definitely the way to go - buy tickets in advance online. Pros:- FAST (300kph) modern & comfortable trip. - Recommend 1st Class - roomy seats- GREAT scenery!!!- Both stations easy to maneuverCons:- NO WiFi - wasn‚Äôt working!!- No food - bring your own snacks, food & beer."
40,4.0,"10 million people living in Seoul means the KTX underground rail system is used by a lot of people as an alternative to using cars and buses to get around this busy and vibrant city. Buy a re-loadable ticket at the subway (or I believe 7/11?), then load up on fare before you go in. Fares are reasonable. English can be selected on auto machines too. Easy to follow to load money.Subway is very busy esp in Peak hour. We were very frustrated when lifts and escalators were not working due to having a painful foot injury. Each stop is announced in Korean and English. Most trains have a screen to display upcoming stop too.Expect to stand up most times. KTX is a good reliable system to reach many places in Seoul and outlying areas. Good for tourists too."
41,4.0,"We took KTX to go to Busan and also because of the legend of Train to Busan. We enjoyed the ride - it was fast, clean and efficient. We got our tickets few days before the date and on our way back we got the train from Shingyeongju, which looked like a relatively new station. Coming form a country with weak transportation systems, KTX blew our mind."
42,5.0,"Trains are always the best way to see a country as you travel long distance through it. We went from Seoul station to Gyeongju ( the meseum without walls) . Tickets booked in UK, no issues. Chose 1st class only ¬£20 extra. Seats very comfortable with trays and recliners. Tip:  if you want to sit together ( the wife insists on this!!!!) seat B and C are together with A across the isle. In first class they do come round with a complimentary pack,containing.......bag of nuts, a cookie and a wipe. Suggest you buy provisions at Seoul station before getting on- prices normal. Train departed platform 6 from Seoul. Carriage numbers are on the platform floor and on side of carriage. Journey to Gyeongju was two hours, believe Busan is 2 hrs 40 mins. Taxi from station to the town Tumuli Park (  by the kings tombs) was 17000. Great tourist info centre at station people very helpful. Train has charging points, announcements in English as well as Korean"
43,1.0,"i am an asian and had to change to earlier train. my original train was scheduled at 10Ôºö00.i arrived at the desk 9Ôºö10. the lady told us we could catch the 9Ôºö35. when she was about to change the booking, two europeans came in and wanted to buy tickets for trains departing at 10Ôºö10. the staff chose to serve them first, while i was in a hurry to catch 9Ôºö35  train. it took them 10 mins to finish up, and it was 9Ôºö20, the staff said sorry for making me to wait.it was possible they could screw me up if it took 5 mins more. it was so rush because if the delay. i cannot accept the explaination from staff that changing tickets is more complex than buying. the time took her to change my tickets was just the same as serving that two europeans.this is discrimination. i hope staff could have some courage to tell every single customer to queue up, and make professional decisions at work."
44,1.0,"I had similar experiences with some of the other travelers here, which clearly shows that yes there is a problem with the KORAIL ONLINE TICKETING SYSTEM!We tried to book the tickets to Busan, and upon clicking payment, the system hang showing an error message. With no email notification, and no reservation number, we figured that the booking didnt went through, so we clicked to purchase the second time. After we show up at Seoul to exchange the tickets, the officer also didnt inform us that we had 2 tickets bought... It was only after we came back from our trip that I realized I was charged twice for the tickets! We tried to call their customer service hotline, but with their limited English, they couldnt really understand me. Also no email or online messenger to contact them, and the only way is to attempt to speak to their staff via the hotline. So after explaining everything, the stuff still didnt understand and just kept telling me no refund as it's pass the travel date already. Even after I explained that it was due to the error on their website, yet they still insist that there's no error on their website, so no refund. SERIOUSLY?!!!! The mistake was from your own website yet it has been incurred to so many customers innocently. For those traveling to Korea, I would suggest that you buy direct from the station and not from online. Also, good luck too as I remember that the staff could'nt really speak much English at the station too!"
45,5.0,"they speak english at the ticketcounter, so you can get easy to a ticket (seat number). Good connections Soeul to Busan."
46,2.0,"Clean and fast is the only positives. But pointless WiFi. Pointless air conditioning and uncomfortable chairs. Honestly they say South Korea is the most wired country in the world!!! In most of Western Europe, China and Japan the availability of WiFi far passes Korea!!! Just a general warning."
47,5.0,"For our second visit to South Korea the best, fastest and easiest way to travel from Seoul to Jeonju and Busan to Seoul was to take the KTX.  The service was always on time, clean, seat comfortable and traveled in near silence.  As we were on a schedule I purchased our tickets online one week in-advance, an easy booking and payment process.  The ticket price never changes, always a fixed price not like in Europe.  I purchased second class tickets which are significantly cheaper to first class and just as comfortable for a 1.75 hour and a 3 hour journey respectfully.  Seats are assigned and tickets issued immediately online ready for printing at home.  We always take water and pick up snacks in the subway or nearby train station for the journeys, but you can purchase on-board."
48,4.0,"Traveled from Busan to Seoul in about 2 hours.  Very quick and convenient.  You are given an assigned seat, and it is better to stay there, even if the car is half empty, or risk being rapped by the attendant and told to move.  Very interesting view of South Korea, mostly green mountains, fields and clusters of apartment buildings.  Less suburbanization than you would think."
49,4.0,Traveled from Busan to Seoul on the KTX. Price was approximately 80000.00 KRW P/person for first class. KORAIL was very helpful at the Busan station and obliged to change our tickets to an earlier train. The train trip was excellent and quick and within a very short time approx 2hr 42 minutes we had arrived at Seoul. Traveling at speeds to a maximum of 299 klm/hr. They are very efficient and punctual on timings. Easy trip!
50,5.0,"The most commonly used mode of transportation to Busan. It was super convenient - we purchased our tickets online (the site is in English thank goodness), printed a copy of our tickets and brought it along. On the day we only had to show the print out to enter and nothing else. As simple as that. Arrive 15-20 minutes before and you‚Äôre good to go."
51,5.0,It was surely the most convenient train ride Ive ever experienced. It also offers a nice view of the country
52,4.0,"Used the Busan to Seoul service and was happy with our experience. You have plenty of space in your seating, there are power outlet for charging and you can choose whether you want to sit facing the driving direction or backwards. The train left on time and arrived on the minute. Very efficient, only the price was the only concern. Same as flying, however, you end up in the city centre with the train which can be desirable for some."
53,5.0,"Easy to purchase tickets for a necessary seat.. clean, quiet, and peaceful.  timely, punctual, and stress free"
54,5.0,"Coming from Australia I can only say our Government have a great deal to learn about public transport. We took the ITX to ChunCheon and for 7300 won each to travel each way it was not only cheap but comfortable and actually on time. The ride was so smooth you forgot you were on a train. Book online at least one day before and select your date and time and you will travel cheap. The Korea Travel Pass is also a great idea but about an 81000 won initial outlay (but you do get greater flexibility). We left ChunCheon earlier than expected (after gorging on Dak Galbi at Dak Galbi Street. and with the help of the wonderful young lady at the tourist information booth, were able to get on an earlier train at no cost. But be beware, if you buy at the station on the day you risk not getting a seat and standing room only."
55,5.0,Seoul airport is a good 45 minute train ride away from the city centre so it is best to get the express train from the airport for a direct route to the city. Leave the airport departure and walk to the information centre to buy your tickets which at the end of your ride you put in a machine to help recycle your tickets and get some money back. The information desk is wonderful and directs you to the platform where you wait for your train to arrive near the door that will open according to the carriage number on your ticket. The trains arrive promptly and you need to get on promptly so don‚Äôt hang about! A great resource to enhance your travels
56,5.0,"Took the KTX from Seoul to Busan. A 2:15 hours journey. The experience was great. A combination of speed and comport, its a great way to travel around South Korea.And the free WiFi on board was a plus!"
57,4.0,"After spending many years dealing with the UK rail system, it was an enjoyable experience to catch trains which seem to always run on time!   Easy and convenient, it made train travel pleasant!"
58,5.0,"Comfortable, convenient, easy to figure out, totally terrific mass transportation system.  We took it to the Olympics. You can turn the seats to face another pair, so our foursome could talk."
59,5.0,"With the addition of the east-west KTX lines, it is now possible to go between any major city in South Korea in about 3 hours.  The KTX lines have revolutionized how Koreans live and work in  Korea."
60,3.0,"The train seats are clean and comfortable. However, the ticket system can be improved on. From Seoul Station subway, you need to buy a ticket for entry to the KTX terminal. Then when you arrive at the airport, you need to get a refund on the subway ticket. Not very friendly for tourists."
61,5.0,We took the KTX from Seoul to Daegu (and back) and thoroughly enjoyed our experience.  We chose first class to get a reserved seat.  They offer a small snack and free bottles of water in this section.  The high speed service was on time and is a great way to travel to the major cities in South Korea.
62,5.0,"We took KTX from Seoul main station to Busan. It was hassle free, convenient and very user friendly. All the train staff speaks decent English and we have no trouble at all to secure tickets. There are overhead space to put your luggage bag but from observation - it might fit the Medium large luggage but Large size could be a bit darn heavy to lift. The seats are comfortable for the almost 3 hrs ride and they have free Wifi on board. Highly recommended."
63,5.0,"We always prefer taking KTX Train when traveling from Ulsan to Seoul reasons being It's fast, convenient, clean, spacious and very comfortable. It's fairly priced as well. They offer Free WiFi while and provide free bottled water machines for First Class ticket holders. Highly recommend for anyone looking to avoid airports and save some time!"
64,5.0,"Do not be afraid to organise your own day trips out of Seoul and fall prey to the organised tour operators who prey on the nervous traveler. We got the KTX from Inchelon Airport to central Seoul and then a taxi to our hotel, no problem. A few days later we went to Jeonju Hanock Village by KTX, again taxi to Yongsan Station, easily booked KTX seats on the day, heard all announcements in the clearest english I have ever heard at a train station, kept an eye on very informative Departure Board and even checked with the friendly information desk. The most pleasant journey there and back. Do things yourself."
65,1.0,"REALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH KORAIL, the website was not good, there is no email to contact and the staffs suck.We have tried to book ticket to Busan on Jan 12, 2018, the website malfunctioned, did not issue nor give us the Korail pass number, and also did not charge the credit card on the purchasing day. Hence, we thought the ticket was not successfully bought and we ended up buying the ticket from the ticket machine at Seoul Station.Yesterday, we realised the charge was there (but without ticket issued from your website bcos it was malfunctioned at that time we tried to buy) We called the company, the staffs were not helpful. The lady who I just talked to did not understand what ""malfunction"" means. She even said to me ""I cannot understand Chinese, talk English please"". WHAT THE HELL I was talking all the time in English and you were the one who was less knowledgeable to understand English. This is really humiliating to talk to customers like this, They refused to help us even the fault was from their error website and we have to pay for the charge that was not on our account.so for WHOEVER IS TRAVELLING TO KOREA, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS."
66,1.0,This is terrible to reserve a ticket on the internet site for foreigners. The web site does not work for reservation without a KOREAN PHONE number at all and call service with #1577-9999 does not work either. It is a hassle for any non-live Korea person. You practically have to go to buy a ticket at the train station and it sucks if there is no ticket left.
67,4.0,"Took this train to Pyenchong thinking that we could see something of the 2018 Olympics...wrong...only construction, I do  hope they have it finished by February.  The train, was clean, fast, and quiet. Great tripi althouh we saw no Olympic city we saw the country side"
68,5.0,"Busan to Seoul 2 hours 10 minutes. Quieter than Japan's Shinkansen, but not spacious enough. Every car has a luggage storage but it's too little. You'd better go there early and put your luggage before others doa little less than 60000W per person."
69,5.0,"We pre-purchased our tickets (Seoul to Busan) on the KTX website prior to arriving in Seoul. Website was easy to use and we requested seats together.With our printout in hand (with QR code) and passport we got our tickets at Seoul station without any trouble. Having ridden the shinkansen in Japan, we arrived an hour ahead of departure to ensure we were on the right platform and station. Ride was smooth and fast and the train was clean and comfortable. There were hot water dispensers and a canteen on certain trains. Luggage stowing area could potentially be a bit limited if travelling in a car where everyone has big suitcases. Outside snacks and drinks were allowed on board."
70,5.0,"These trains are a delight to use if you are travelling across South Korea. We travelled to Busan from Seoul and it only take 2 and a half hours, and was probably the most comfortable train ride I've ever been on. Buying the travel pass can be a bit complicated, which is my only complaint but once you know what you're doing it's fairly straightforward, and really useful. The price is quite decent considering the distance travelled, and was really happy with the condition of the train itself. Luggage storage can be a bit tricky to store so keep this in mind if you have a lot to travel with."
71,4.0,"I did not expect to sit going backwards for nearly 3 hours from Incheon down to Daegu.  I wish all the seats sat one way.  Also, there is limited spots for larger suitcases especially those traveling for more than a few days.The ticketing was easy and boarding was easy.  The seats were comfortable.  It is REALLY nice to have a restroom right there."
72,5.0,We took a trip to Busan from Seoul first class. It was very nice and quick. Highly recommend over the internal travels by plane.
73,4.0,"KTX bullet train is very popular both with locals & tourist. And is usually full.Advance booking is allowed only one month from travelling dates. We booked online one month in advance & reserved our seats both ways Seoul-Busan-Seoul.Its a comfortable ride & moves on-time . Normal class is good enough for the 2.45 hours one way journey.But please buy some food before you board the KTX long journey. Only drinks & light snacks are sold onboard by pushcart staff - its limited & expensive!Take note that Busan KTX station is not linked directly to Busan Metro. You need to exit KTX station & walk across about 50 metres to a ""plaza"" where Busan Metro is."
74,5.0,"Booked to travel from Busan to Seoul. Booking process was simple, but there is no option to choose the seats. The system automatically assigns the Car and Seats. Ample space at the back of the car for luggage. Train ride was quiet. Toilet was available, but it stank a bit, as if it had not been cleaned. Free wifi on board. We booked to travel by First Class, and free water and snacks provided."
75,3.0,"We took the KTX from Seoul station to Busan station. The speed was nowhere near 300kph which we expected. Although the ride was smooth, it was disappointing as we wanted to experience the high speed. Service was punctual and stopped at several stations along the way. You get to view the countryside along the way. The fare was much more expensive than our airfare for the flight from Jeju to Seoul. Unless you wish to experience a KTX train ride or see the countryside, you might be better off taking a flight."
76,5.0,Staying in Seoul we booked first class seats on the KTX to go to Busan for the day. Well worthwhile.The booking process was easy. The trains leave regularly and on timeSeats were roomy and comfortableNot a lot of choice from the food cart but you can take your own food and water is provided via vending machinesAt 300km per hour a great way to see the South Korean countryside
77,4.0,Good comfortable experience Nice picturesque view from Seoul to yeosuFree water & has vendors selling snacks Wifi is free & good connectionOne can keep working since one is on line all the time View from train attached in pictures
78,5.0,"Very impressive.  Trains run frequently, and the ride was comfortable, quiet, smooth, and very fast.  No usual train noise at all.  Passengers are advised to stay quiet and even refrain from cell phone uses (this was a bit much, but nice still).  So well mannered people all around.  Recommend people to use this train system by all means."
79,5.0,"This is our second experience of a return trip out of Seoul on KTX. Like our first time, we booked online at Korail English website. The earliest you can reserve is 30 days in advance, with credit card and passport details, which we did for our ride out from Seoul to Busan. Since we planned on staying in Busan for 4 days, we booked our return trip later 4 days later, as it would be on a Sunday, and that would be peak travel time. Would have preferred to be able to book for return trips on korail rather than single trips though each time.We printed both our reservations and on the actual day, we came about an hour earlier to get our tickets at Seoul station. By the way we don't speak Korean but it should be fine as long as you have the printouts, passport and credit card. I obtained our return trip tickets then as well as we were sure of our return trip back from Busan to Seoul, which on hindsight, was a good thing as otherwise we would have to queue with the rather large crowds with luggages on our return trip back from Busan Station. Our KTX back to Seoul had Incheon as the last stop, not Seoul, hence there were many passengers with luggages as they headed for flights departures at Incheon airport.We were glad we decided to board the train early as we did not have much else to do at Busan station, despite having given ourselves time to have a light meal at a delightful cafe that offered a variety of Korean porridges and mouth watering traditional rice cakes there. As we were early ( 15 minutes before departure) we could place our luggage at the rear of the car that we boarded, and soon there were luggages stacked even in whatever space available between train cars. Both our train rides were comfortable, barred the occasional difficult landing loud passenger but nevertheless firmly and professionally handled by the train staff in the return leg as the train was full throughout. We helped ourselves to the free mineral water at the vending machine and the English language papers, and other magazines, on the Seoul to Busan ride, as we paid for first class seats. There were no English language papers on the return leg though. We did not use KTX wifi as we had our own wifi rental. On return leg, we passed through numerous tunnels for a good part of the initial journey, so there was no network during those times. All in all, the KTX  rides were pleasant, not as thrilling as the movie perhaps, but who would want it to?"
80,3.0,"We travel on Korail Pass. You still need to book seats beforehand, but there is nothing else to pay. Seoul-Busan, vice versa, is very full on weekends. If there are no more seats available, you can still get on, but you need to stand. Or if you are lucky, you may get the ""extra"" folded seats (jump-seats) just by the door. There is no need to reserve seats if you are willing to stand (if you have Korail Pass). It would have been better if they have a couple of carriages for unreserved seats, similar to Japan JR system, instead of allowing people to just get on and stand when the train is full without any control. You will find lots of people just standing around the doors. There is no barrier to enter the rail tracks, so anyone can get on. They only check tickets on the train.Pros: There is also free wifi and USB charge on each seat. Cons: you may get a backward facing seat, as the seats are fixed and you cannot flip over."
81,4.0,Arrive at the airport late in the night and glad that the train station was still in operationto bring us to city. Staff was very helpful although they are not very well verse in English for communication. Train was superb and comfortable. Impressive.
82,5.0,We took the KTX from Seoul to Busan. Then again from Busan to Gyeongu. And the again back to Seoul.Always in time! Comfortable and not expensive considering how fast you arrive to your destination.Good service and helpful staff at the train it self.
83,4.0,"It's fast.   Seoul to busan in 2 hr 40 min.  Reserve the ticket online but still had to wait at ticket counter for getting the ticket.  So make sure you allow extra time for lining up...  I waited 15 minutes.  We took first class, seat was wide and comfortable.  Free water and free wifi...  wifi is a bit on and off.  Door opening and closing is loud so try to get the middle of the train seats."
84,3.0,KTX to Busan was okay. It was speedy but nothing too special. We spent close to 100 dollars and plus to get there. Recommend taking the bus because they also have very comfortable seats which go all the way down which adds comfort to the ride. Travel early in the morning and save money & time! The service on KTX needs to improve. The front desk personal plus the staff on board needs more training.
85,4.0,"We took the KTX from Busan to Seoul, and would recommend this train for any traveller who need to travel between major cities in Korea. There is at least 1 train per hour, free wifi on board and comfortable seating (similar to an economy airline seat) in economy class. Refreshments can be purchased on board. This train also provides a direct service linking Busan with Incheon airport in Seoul. It is easy enough to transfer from the KTX stations in Seoul/Busan to the local subway too. It is pretty much the same as the Shinkansen trains in Japan, although the ride was not quite as smooth."
86,4.0,"On a trip to Japan, I had to get to incheon pretty early to beat the chuseok traffic. Bought a train ticket online with relative ease. And when we got on the train, it was a pretty simple ordeal. The only down side is that the metro in youngsam does t get up and running until 5a. So, plan your flights/trips accordingly. However, the station is insanely accommodating and you can sit and relax, as best you can, without any issues.Happy travels!!"
87,5.0,"Consistent with most reviewers here, always a fantastic experience. Punctual to the dot, super fast,  clean and has free wifi connection throughout the journey. Ktx station in Seoul is really awesome and convenient with lots of stores everywhere. It also connects to AREX and other local subway stations. One of the hallmarks of excellent korean infrastructure."
88,5.0,Can only add to the list of positive reviews Booked online at the official website. Collected tickets at Seoul station with passport number ad reference Trains are spot on time Speeds are around 280 to 290 kmph on average and is shown on the screen inside Free WiFi inside the train Drinks and light snacks available for purchase Scenery is average with many tunnels as well Perhaps the best way to travel between the 2 cities
89,3.0,"The KTX rail pass is not as easy to use as Japan's JR Pass. Here, you NEED to reserve your seats whether you're taking the KTX, ITX or any of the slower trains. It's not easy to reserve seats if you're going to popular touristy places round trip on the same day. But it's pretty easy if you're just reserving a one-way trip (i.e. Seoul-Busan). People at the tickets windows are not very accommodating given that there's always a long line of people waiting to purchase tickets. They can hardly speak English so you'll have to tell them when and where you want to go. They won't offer you any suggestions. I suggest you go to a less busy station to book your tickets as they are more accommodating there. Everything becomes easy once you have your seats reserved. All you have to do is to be at the KTX station at the appointed time, board the train and relax."
90,5.0,"For people from other countries- Check into Korail-- You can buy a pass from 1 dayup to 7 days-  The High Speed KTX and the other trains are included. Not Busesor local subway lines.    Very easy to travel the whole country. We went from Seoul to Mokpo,Yeosu,Busan,Pohang, Daegu, Daejeon, on our 7 day pass. VERY EASYTO USE.  We stayed in the center of the country at Jeonju. 1 Day trip to Mokpo.1 Day trip to Yeosu. Then on to Busan. I day trip to to Pohang--A MUST.I night in Daejon and back to Seoul.. Very comfortable on the KTX. Check the Korail website.--It must be reserved at least 7 days before you arrive. The clock startswhen you exchange your voucher for a pass. If you are just going to stay in the Seoul area only, this is not for you."
91,5.0,Took this speed demon to Busan from Seoul and it was a pleasure to ride. You really don't feel the speed at which you travel. Sit back and enjoy the experience.
92,4.0,"We took the KTX from Seoul to Busan. Easy purchasing process at the train station, staff understood English and used a calculator to communicate the price. Trains departed every 10-15 minutes so very convenient. Very smooth ride, can hardly tell how fast the train is moving. Most people fall asleep.There is little space for luggage so if you don't get on early enough then you just keep your luggage with you near your allocated seat which can be a little annoying if you have heavy bags."
93,5.0,"I took the KTX from Osong station to Ulsan and then return from Ulsan to Gangnam.  The KTX was great, I bought my tickets online and just had to pick them up at the ticket counter with my reservation number.  It was comfortable and fast.  It may have been a little pricey, but well worth the time savings and not having to deal with busses.  Both stations were also easy to figure out where to go and were nice.  You get designated cars and seats, and the platforms are labeled so you know where to wait.  There is WiFi on the trains also that is free and bathrooms.  A food cart goes around also, but all the stations I went to had little convenience stores you could buy magazines or food at.A big point, some people have said theres no luggage storage for larger bags, but its actually in the area in between the cars near the bathroom.  There were 2 spots for larger luggage, but I think you can put extra bags on the floor in that area.  Smaller bags go up top.  Initially I put my larger bag up top and it stayed up there very well though either way."
94,4.0,"I enjoy the KTX. It's usually faster than plane when you consider the distance and time to get to airports and check in. There is no hassle from attendants unless you are in the wrong seat for some reason. They Engilsh website and reservation system for tourists sucks, though, but that's country wide with almost every website. I dislike the 4 seats in the middle are kit strictly for families. My friends and I used to love those seats. You can drink openly on the train, too, just don't be loud."
95,5.0,"we only had 8 nights in Korea but with the train system we were able to get down to Busan from Seoul in no time.The KTX,was effecient,on time and comfortable.We just rocked up and bought the tickets on the day no worries."
96,5.0,This has to be the best way to go. The ticketing and booking is very easy. The trains are spotless and a pleasure to travel on. You travel at 300kph and the free wifi is faultless.
97,5.0,"We booked a three day korail pass. With this pass you can travel around by train as much as you want. The KTX is the korean bullet traim and the fastest available choice. Took us 2 1/2h from Seoul to Busan. The train is french build and quivalent to the french TGV. It is the fastest (250km/h) and most comfortable way to travel in Korea. You get reserved seats. The train and the toillets are very clean (much cleaner than in europe). You can use wifi which is quite fast and for free. There are beverages and snacks sold on the train. Prices are fair (Stabucks frappucino 3.000 won). There are different korail passes 1,3 and 5 days I think. Our 3-day group of two pass was around 80.000 won per person. If you want to travel the country take the KTX!"
98,4.0,"It's on time, gets you to your destination fast and has wifi (huge plus). But it's honestly just not that nice of a train. Old seats, and looks a little dingy. The bullet trains in Japan are WAY nicer."
99,1.0,"If you don't care about the money you spend, you might want to buy the Korail Pass. But it is a huge waste of money. We got the online reservaton for a 7 day pass, but we didn't exchange it after all, because it is so much cheaper to travel by bus or even by train without the pass. If you don't want to go back and forth through all of Korea about 4 times a day, it is not worth buying it. There is a great bus network, that is cheap, fast and punctual and in most cases you don't even need to reserve the tickets beforehand. We found this page www.ga82.com, which proved to be very helpful and shows you all possible connections by bus or train. If you don't believe me check the prices there, a small calculation will show you that you properbly won't have t spend half as much money as they want to have for that KORAIL pass. Still before heading to the bus terminal ask again at the hostel reception. most of the times the page was correct, but the hostel staff was always very helpful and it is good to varify the information. So don't be scared, travelling in Korea is cheap and easy and don't buy the KORAIL pass, it is enoumously overpriced!"
100,3.0,"We booked our online reservation 3 days before our travel to Korea. When we arrived at Korea, we went to KTX seoul station to get out actual ticket. We booked a day before our trip to Busan to ensure that there are still seats available to our preferred time. We got the saver ticket (120,000 won for 2 persons) which is available for foreigners only.The train left exactly 6:25AM as per trip schedule. It has few stops. But overall its quite comfortable. Just small leg room compared to NOZOMI bullet train of Japan. Its efficient and fast transportation going to Busan."
101,5.0,Travelled form Seoul (Seoul Station) to Busan via the KTX. Efficient and Fast way to travel. Seats were 'airline style' without reclining and were comfortable. There was a trolley service if you were hungry or thirsty. Booking the train was the longest part of the whole trip - Foreigners have to book and pay online no more that 1 month in advance (it won't show you the train schedule more than a month out from your date of travel). Once in Seoul you exchange the online receipt for real tickets before you travel.
102,5.0,DMZ tour  it was set up thru OSAN and it was fantastic and took all day.  It included lunch and several different stops.  Also the JSA tour and view
103,5.0,"We took the KTX from Seoul Station to DongDaegu Station, Dong Daegu Station to SinGyeongju Station and SinGyeoungju Station to Seoul.  We purchased tickets and got seat selection on line at korail.com prior to making the trip.  We chose first class since we weren't sure what to expect but might not next time.KTX is extremely punctual arrive and departing on time, not like US airline companies.  Take off, cruising and stopping were very smooth.  Hard to believe we were travelling at 300 kmh.  KTX is a must for saving time while traveling in Korea.  Seoul to Busan is less than three hours."
104,5.0,Rode the KTX from Seoul to Busan.  Very comfortable ride. The trip was about 2-1/2 hours with about 6-7 stops along the way.Nice way to see the country.
105,4.0,Travelled Seoul to Busan. Very scenic. A couple of notes - End seat rows on right side (eg 1C and 1D) have less legroom and as mentioned in other reviews you are booked to your seat (there is no moving to another seat).  As with most rail systems in the world the onboard snack and beverage is pricey. All in all a very civilized way to travel.
106,5.0,Booked online and get ticket from seoul station.  Passport is needed for getting tickets from counter. Seats are very comfortable. There was no any ticket checking inside the cabin. Snacks are available inside the cabin. Paid Cell battery charging available. I think speed was around 250-280 kph. Was on time without any delay. Excellent option for seoul-busan route.
107,5.0,"My first time took the KTX is yesterday . Arriving Seoul Station 30 minutes before my departure time , no need waiting for ticket because I already have the Confirmation and Pass. In ticket you can see which number your train tracks , train carriages and seat number , very convenience for foreigners who dont understand Korea languageTime is very punctual ... Not delay even for 1 minute , so come earlier is the best way. Free wifi during your trip . You also can buy snack and drink in your trip with KTX . Will Stop around 2-3 minutes in  City before your destination. Seat , cannot complaint because i only try Fast Train in China and Taiwan which is new than KTX . But clean , on time schedule , comfortable and free wifi are the most when you choosing KTX , the best transportation in Korea."
108,5.0,"Amazing rides, fast, clean and odorless train..It runs around 300 kmph , and you can reach Busan in only around 2 hours.Tips :1. You can always purchase your ticket in advance. Major Int'l credit cards are accepted.2. On weekend, Seoul-Busan route might be a little bit full, so if you're planning to travel on weekend, it's recommended to purchase it online.3. Keep your ticket with you, but it's quite weird as there's no one was checking the ticket.. (my personal experience)."
109,5.0,"The KTX is a great way to see some of fascinating destinations in South Korea.  The train station is huge and well planned, and signed for English speaking people.  If you are unsure, there are KTX workers that are able to speak a little English and they did help us.  The KTX has two classes - First which is very comfortable and quiet.  Economy class is fine but a bit noiser and is available to book online and view your reservation once booked at http://info.korail.com/2007/eng/eng_index.jsp.  The train goes at up to 300km on the straight parts/tunnels and you see the travelling speed on a tv screen. There is space for suitcases when you get on the train.  The carriage lines up exactly with the number when you walk onto the concourse. There are glass waiting lounges for the KTX in Cheonan Asan station so you are not exposed to the weather.It was easy, comfortable and highly efficient. Nowhere in South Korea is further than 3 hrs from Seoul on the KTX. On the Korean Rail website there you can see the train routes, different passes and online booking.We went down to MOKPO which is a fascinating port city and we enjoyed a visit to the Maritime Museum which was brilliant!  We enjoyed the experience which is world class and would highly recommend to any tourist."
110,5.0,"I travelled from Busan to Singyeongju and back by KTX to visit Bulguksa + Seokguram at Gyeongju. The journey was so pleasant. I like it very much. I turned around within a day. Purchasing of tickets was very easy. Short queue at Busan and virtually no queue at Singyeongju. I think you can also buy ticket at the self-help machines. The counter staff speak English. First class ticket costs 14,800 won one-way from Busan to Singyeongju and the ride was about 20 minutes.Seat arrangement for first class coach is 2 and 1, 3 in a row. All seats facing forward. Very comfortable. Lot of leg room. The cabin is well lit with facilities e.g. toilet, water dispenser, snack trolley, coat hanger, TV etc. My ride was smooth and quiet. Highly recommended. I prefer it over other mode of transport."
111,5.0,The rent car was expensive so I took KTX from Seoul to Busan and I was great choice. I loved it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will take it again.
112,5.0,"We bought saver ticket (if travel >2 pax) cost about 52400won per pax. From Busan to SeoulThe free wifi provided in KTX train is excellent, however the wifi only last for about two hours"
113,5.0,"if you are going somewhere the KTX will take you, I recommend it.  Smoother than air or car travel, easier than going to the airport because there's no security or really any boarding hassles to worry about, faster than car or bus, cheaper than plane, more comfortable than almost anything, it's worth it.  We bought first class tickets back and forth from Seoul to Busan and they were only about $80 apiece.  It took all of two or three minutes to get our tickets at Seoul and Busan stations, after reserving them online (website in English, takes American credit cards), and it took all of two or three minutes to board.  They never even checked out tickets; this operation is so efficient that they probably have a machine that reads your mind and knows whether or not you paid.  First class is very comfortable with a lot of leg room and free water, bathrooms that are a little nicer than airplane bathrooms, and drinks and beer and snacks for purchase.  The entire trip took only about 3.5 hours with three stops because the train gets up to almost 200mph.  But you don't feel a thing, it's much smoother and more comfortable than the Seoul metro or any other train I've ever been on, or an airplane or a car.  You could easily drop off to sleep.  We loved it."
114,5.0,"It is very fast, you could transport from North Korea to its South in may be 3.30 hours and you couldn't feel boring because there is WiFi inside it, sure with youtubes and online videos your amount will finish quickly but if u didn't use videos you ll have amusements and it s very clean"
115,5.0,"No matter how old I get, I am still fascinated by trains. And bullet trains are as awesome as they get. OK maybe Maglev would be more awesome if I ever get to try that.For around $80 USD, we took the 07:30 KTX from Seoul to Singyeongju and took the return trip via the 20:58 train. The ride each way is barely over 2 hours. The trains reach 300 km/h in certain open stretches. That completely makes a day trip to Gyeongju manageable. Note that the Singyeongju (literally New Gyeongju) station is about 15 minutes outside of Gyeongju. A 1,500 KRW bus ride will take you into town or you can take the 700 bus directly to Bulguksa Temple if you want (we did). T-Money is accepted.Back to the KTX. The seats are comfortable and the 2-hour ride was not a problem. They even have wifi for every two train cars. Simply connect to the one that has the strongest signal.They will soon have new lines opening to the airport and to other regions of Korea. These high speed trains really make seeing more of the country easy, convenient, and fun."
116,5.0,"traveled from seoul to busan.comfortable seats.quiet during motion and braking.space for small luggage in rail above seats.compartments @ ends of each train car can hold larger luggages/packages.worth the extra money compared to bus fare or regular train tix.they sell snacks, soft drinks on train during travel.u can bring ur own food and drinks.safe.other passengers are generally respectful of others and not too loud during their conversations or phone calls.can reserve ticket @ Korail web site or go to KTX/Korail ticket counter to make your purchase."
117,5.0,"Have lived in Seoul for 9 months. First trip on the KTX. Just like the Seoul Subway System the trains run on time (to the minute) and is a fast economical way to travel in Korea. You can purchase your tickets online, or at the station. We traveled in Economy to Busan, and First Class on the way back. First Class had more leg room, wider seats, free drinking water, newspapers (they did have English language newspapers available), crackers for a snack and free wifi. The price difference was about 20,000KRW one way between the two classes. There is plenty of food available to eat at both stations, and you can get almost anything to go, so don't worry about eating before you get to the station. Unlike Airports, the food is the same price in the station as it is on the street. I would be remiss not to mention that there is a great food court at Seoul Station. It is on the second level (one level above the main station and two levels above the tracks). It has 17 different food stations, with each station offering about 10 items each. Each order is prepared fresh and is a great way for everyone in your party to have their own type of Korean food."
118,4.0,"The KTX is the best way to travel in Korea, but don't talk.  My boyfriend and I were chatting in low voices, and were were told no talking, at all.   I could understand on a night train, but this was during the day."
119,4.0,"I bought the 3 days KR pass travel from seoul to yeosu and back to Yongsan stationi started with online booking and the system is easy and friendly to use. Upon arrival to seoul station, i make payment and collected my KR passWith the KR pass, i made my train booking at the ticketing counterDuring travel day, i missed my train and the ground staff assisted me to make ticket change to the next fleet at no additional charges. Overall, it is a more comfortable experience to travel within korea as compare to bus. Travel and arrival time are accurate and punctual and this allow us to have a better control over the travel journey."
120,5.0,i loved using the train to travel all around South Korea. i used the bus to get from ICN to KTX my final destination was Daegu.
121,5.0,"We used the KTX Train from Busan to Seoul. We booked the ticket on the internet, exactly a month before our travel date. The web site was very easy and quick. We picked the ticket up at the station and the seat number and wagon number were clear. We bought a sort of hot Bento Box at the station and found the platform easily. We boarded the train about 15 minutes before departure and had no problems in finding our seats. We had two large suitcases and there was ample space for luggage at the end of the wagon. The train was clean and the journey very smooth. The stops were well indicated and there was a trolley service with hot and cold drinks and snacks. The seats were comfortable and nice big windows to look at the view. The train departed and arrived exactly on time."
122,5.0,"Fast, efficient and on time. Trains were clean and very comfortable. Only advice - BOOK ONLINE IN ADVANCE!!!!!!! We thought it would be easy to just buy a ticket at the station and because we weren't sure what time we would be leaving we just left it, however, I think because it was a Friday afternoon it was very difficult getting a ticket - ended up having to wait 2 hours and be seated on separate carriages - which we didn't mind since we got on the train - but in the future I would always book. KTX staff were very helpful."
123,4.0,"We've traveled by KTX from Mokpo to Seoul. It all went smooth, on time and comfortable. And here's a useful tip for those traveling this year; because of 'Visit Korea Year', you can get a 30% discount coupon here: http://english.visitkoreayear.com/english/benefit/benefit_08_01_01.asp. (or simply Google, KTX 30% off)"
124,5.0,We had two trips on the KTX - Seoul to Busan (normal tickets) and Yeosu to Seoul (first class).  The KTX left on time and was fast - up to 300 Klms (190 m) per hour.  Clean and well staffed.  First class has bigger seats and for the price difference worth it if tall like me.   Buy your tickets in advance if you can.
125,5.0,"The Airport bus staff was so unhelpful and unpleasant that we chose the train. Not as good as Hong Kong's but fast, clean and spacious. The buses might take you to your hotel, but they are old,  cluttered, and the traffic can be awful.Take the train!"
126,5.0,"This method of travel beats air travel hands down! The prices for a first class seat are reasonable, and there are no lines for security.  Buying a ticket online, even for an English speaking person, was an easy process. The Seoul Train Station is centrally located and there are taxis aplenty in that area."
127,5.0,"We recently caught the KTX from Seoul to Busan, it was a comfortable ride, we had not booked our seats in advance, rather purchasing on the day as we were not sure if our flight to Incheon international airport would be on time and how long it would take us to get Seoul Station, in fact it took us 2 hours from landing(@1410) to arriving at Seoul station (@1610). Once at Seoul station we tried to purchase our tickets at a ticket machine, there is the option for English, and we were able to get to selecting our tickets but in the end the machine refused to accept our notes, apparently this is a common flaw, and we had to head straight to a ticket office for our purchase.  We went first class on the next available train(@1700) only because we didn't want to wait one hour for the next available second class seats(@1800).On board the KTX to Busan, there is a food cart that comes through selling Korean snacks and drinks, but as we were unfamiliar with Korean food at this stage we did not purchase anything.  The announcements on board are in Korean and English.  Our journey took 2 hrs and 45 minutes, a great travel solution."
128,5.0,i love this train. the signboard is clear for travellers and it is easily accessed from the airport. It is considered cheap for me as conpared to taking a cab from the airport
129,5.0,"I'm a huge fan of trains in general, so getting on the ktx was a must for me.  It was comparable to the kodama shinkansen we took in Japan, although the seats in the KTX were smaller (we took the green car in Japan, which is the equivalent of a business/first class).  The KTX is much cheaper than the shinkansen though (even the discount tickets we got for the kodama were comparably more expensive) so if you just want to try a high speed train this may be the one for you!If ever we go back to Korea I'm planning on taking one of the slower trains, the Saemaul(sp?).  It take a little less than twice as long as the KTX, but the seats are supposed to be much nicer, and it's also cheaper than the KTX.If you're coming departing or arriving from Busan station, you might like to try out the Bon Hola cafe.  It's got a great view of the port area and a salad/sashimi buffet for 13000 won each."
130,5.0,Loved the fact that we could catch a train and travel at a reasonal rate and in good time!
131,2.0,"KTX is marketed as comparable to Japan's Shikansen. NOT! We took the KTX to Shin-Gyeongju to visit Bulguksa and it was just like a regular train. Maybe the better trains run on other lines. The seats face backwards and forwards and the direction cannot be changed. Luckily, we had the forwards facing seats or I would have puked :-( The pitch of the seats was not spacious. Overall, it was kind of pricey for the quality you get.Seoul Station was also very disappointing. Again, cannot be compared with train stations in Japan. In Japan, there are all kinds of shops selling food and stuff. Even department stores! In Seoul, there was only Lotte. The food court was sucky too. Nothing nice to eat/see/buy."

133,5.0,"We took the KTX train from Seoul to Ulsan January 20. We booked first class seats early as it was the lunar new year weekend, and seat were limited: good choice. The Korean staff were very respectful and helpful, bowing as they entered and left our train car. The total fare for two was around $100 USD. Top speed was around 200mph, and so smooth!Although the subway links with the KTX at the Seoul station, too many steps are involved if you have large suitcases, as we did. We took a taxi from the Metro hotel for about $5 and were dropped at the station entrance where sloped ramps lead right to the check-in/waiting area.We reserved and paid online, and picked up our tickets at the Korail  Dorasan Station near the DMZ to avoid the lines in Seoul: how convenient!"
