0,5.0,"I love being out there especially in the crips morning, maybe mostly to avoid a lot of other people. It is also quite interesting to walk on elevated wooden roadways. The signs say it will take between 2-3 hours you can easily do it under 2 hours I believe."
1,5.0,The Jarak-gil trail of Ansan is a very well developed fairly easy trail to hike. It is crowded on the weekends but less so than some other mountains such as Bukhansan (also worth hiking but on a less crowded weekday). I recommend going off the trail to really explore the mountain places such as Beacon hill and the water wheel the first time you hike Ansan. When the sky is clear you can get some awesome views of the different parts of Seoul. It is also worth exploring Bongwonsa Temple and Independence Park at the base of the mountain.
2,5.0,"Totally enjoyed myself here. I like hiking, but have little opportunity to do so. Came here with no expectations except a 4.6 out of 5 rating on google. Totally satisfied.The park centres around a peak of approx 280-290m height. most trails are under the shade of trees, which is great for hotter weather. The trails which go around the park are mostly concrete, and have a meandering gentle up and down. Trails which start heading uphill can get steeper, are a mix of concrete steps, dirt inclines, stone steps. Towards the peak, you have to scramble up some rocks and some ropes as railings.You can get a great view of Seoul and soem surrounding peaks from Ansan Jarak-gil. Can also get some relief from the city noises like cars as well.  On the Thursday I went, there were many people. I'd say about 75% were 50-80yo .There are a lot of features in the park. There are some pagodas with older Chinese/Korean style roofs. Several areas have parks with exercising apparatus like chin up bars, benches for sit ups, and even multiple weight machines that you see in gyms that you can pull out pins to choose different weights. In addition, there are some water springs, which have water running out of a hose (ok...they could simply be piped water running out of a hose, but they call it a spring, ) from which you can drink by using the ladels in the area, or, refill your water bottle like I did. I liked the park. The peak had good views, but wasn't too tall for me. You had many options for trails.it was very well signed, with directions not only showing what was where, but the distance in metres, including nearest train stations. There were 3 train stations, I think. When I returned home, I went on instagram to search this park- a few had pics from winter, and everything was covered in snow- it looked beautiful. I'd love to see this park in the winter as well one day."
