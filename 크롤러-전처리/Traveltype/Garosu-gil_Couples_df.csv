0,2.0,"Yes this is a fancy area, where locals shop, but sales assistants are just rude or don't offer you any service. It's a stark contrast to shopping in Myeondong, and after visiting Garosu-gil, I actually prefer it.  Even a restaurant we had dinner at a couple of streets back from the main strip gawked at us."
1,4.0,"If you're looking for unique stuff, then visit this place.Pretty pricey area! This is where Korean local elite class go."
2,4.0,famous and exquisite stores are lined up through Garosugil. You can enjoy window shop and walk the way thru after you have dinner
3,4.0,"Lots of plastic surgery clinics here. It's a hip and trendy shopping street. I came here to shop at Lapalette, but I couldn't find it. Overall, a nice neighbourhood and is less crowded compared to Myeongdong."
4,2.0,"This place is only good for restaurant options. The hype for the brand name that I do not even know of is not worth it. Also, it is disappointing that certain stores do not even let you try on shirts and you can not return or exchange it. Not a good spot for shopping in my opinion."
5,5.0,"I went to both Garosu-gil and Myeongdong shopping streets and I have to give Garosu-gil 2 thumbs up! As a cafe / coffee lover, I recommend exploring this place! You will find unique and hipster coffee houses as well as the usual coffee houses (such as Line Cafe) you will commonly find in Korea. Moreover, you see people wear really trendy and fashionable clothes here than in Myeongdong. Another bonus point is there are quite a number of insta-photo spots where you can take nice photos :)"
6,5.0,"We stayed in this neighborhood as a base for exploring the rest of Seoul. Advantages are that there are numerous small streets on either side of Dosan-Daero 13-gil to explore filled with boutique cafes, restaurants, bars, karaoke, and shops. Although Dosan-Daero 13-gil has lots of western name brand stores, the streets to either side seem to mostly have one-offs that are currently under-represented on trip advisor. There are very few western tourists on these side streets but it seems very popular with local 20- and 30-somethings. Restaurants range across Korean, Japanese, French, Italian, Mexican, Indian, Thai, Vietnamese. Especially enjoyable for walking around in the early evenings when it is cooler and the shops are still open (generally until 9 or 10pm). A little harder to find restaurants for breakfast before 10am, though there are some. Arrive using the Sinsa metro station, take exit 8, and then turn down any of the streets to the left to access the area."
7,5.0,"If you enjoy cafe hopping, this is a must visit on your list. Don't forget to wonder off the main road as that is where many cafes are located and don't forget to look up as most cafes are not located on ground floor.If you live shopping, this is also a great place to visit. Prices here are not like those underground subway shopping, it is more expensive here. However, the style here is different from those sold at the underground subway shops... So it's not apples for apples comparsion."
8,4.0,"Short shopping street, come here to find some designer clothes. It is a kind of boulevard located not far from the metro station, full of interesting shops (small) with designer clothes. Several cafes are located here also so if you are not interested to buy anything just sit on the terrace with your espresso and watch Korean chicky-micky hipsters ;-))"
9,4.0,this area is quite a hot spot for fashion loversso many small shops and caf√©sreally nice to spent some hours here
10,4.0,One of the lovely Cat cate located at Shinsa Dong. Its worth to go to take a rest to visits lovely cats overthere. Especially where there is cold or hot outside or you have been too tired after shopping.
11,3.0,Another overhyped area called a tourist attraction for a reason that's beyond me. Shops for luxury brands or just simply local ones that's been gentrified. Cafes and restaurants here and there. There's really nothing outstanding here.
12,3.0,"Relax walking street with many Korean cosmetics shops, ladies boutiques & the popular LINE store.Found a nice cafe opposite side of the shopping area."
13,4.0,"Apparently this is the 'it' street where all the cool people go.It's a cute area, the street itself is only about 700m or so with shops on both sides including Forever 21 and the Line store. It reminds me of Chapel St in Melbourne or Bleecker St in New York, small but fashionable. The side streets offer alot of more upscale restaurants while the main drag is mainly boutiques.Nice area to visit but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here."
14,5.0,"Despite some of the other reviews, this is a great area to walk around and slowly drink your cup of coffee.  Enjoy the people watching of this ever-so-trendy neighborhood.  Take in a bite to eat if you have a chance.  Yes, the shops are expensive but it's all about the experience.  If time permits, this area is in close proximity of Hangang Park.  With your second cup of coffee, take a walk over to the river."
15,5.0,Lovely place with lots of nice cafes and good restaurants filled with fashionable people. A shopping haven for girls at the Main Street.
16,4.0,This district is nice if you just want to get a cup of coffee/tea at a trendy cafe and watch the beautiful Koreans or go shopping.
17,3.0,We went there late around sunset and we send nice time walking around. It is good to spend three hours.
18,4.0,There were a lot of small interesting shops. But I found nothing special compared to Myungdong. Good place to walk around and check out nice cars parked on the side street.
19,5.0,"If you like shopping and cafe hopping, this is the place to be! If you go, don't forget to visit Banana Tree - it's a tiny cafe, but has Instagram worthy drinks and desserts!"
20,3.0,You wouldn't miss this spot if you start your walk down Insadong street from the Anguk station. Interesting shops and cafes as you walk up the building from the ground to the top level.  You get a good view of the surrounding areas at the top of the building.
21,4.0,"Love the buildings, unique cafes and restaurants, beauty outlets minus the myeongdong crowd. Can spend the evening here strolling the streets and chill with good company over wine or beer"

24,5.0,"There are lots of restaurants, cafes, clothes shops, and so forth along the avenu, which are very good to browse. You can see many tourists, couples, and students walking aroun there. The parking fee there is a little high."
25,4.0,This place is really posh. You can see a lot of clothes shops and cafes here. There are many pretty and stylish girls on the street. You can also see quite many girls and boys who wear masks. I guess they just finish their plastic surgery.
26,5.0,Also look for Hyundai department store walkable from here - higher quality then Harrods Nice quality shops in this street it is also near the famous gangnam area
27,4.0,Come with a loaded wallet.  You'll want to spend days shopping here.  We found some great deals at Aland and other chains stores.  Lots of fun fashion to bring home with you.

31,5.0,"This district is all about what is hip, happening, and now. See and be seen! Shop for trendy clothes and eat in celebrity chef restaurants. Grab a cocktail and watch the BMW's and Mercedes roll by. This is where the young, rich, and want-to-be K Pop stars come out the eat, shop and play!"

34,4.0,"Adorable, hip shopping area in Seoul.  Loads of cool shops and boutiques including a number of chain stores.  The dessert cafes are a must for a delicious stop.  My husband I stopped at ""La Eskimo"" for some other-worldy cake and iced coffee.  It's definitely the perfect way to relax after a nice walk through these beautiful streets!"
35,3.0,Active mode. Recommend walk. There are many cafe and restaurant. But very similar.
36,2.0,"This is very much a yuppie street for the young and rich, with unfortunately (or unsurprisingly) a slightly pretentious vibe. After you are done pushing past the scores of women with face masks (fresh from a visit to the plastic surgery clinic), you have to prevent yourself from keeling over at the sight of overpriced labels and price tags. While I can accept the place of local high-end boutiques, there are only a few of these here; many of the other shopping options are by your foreign brands.Unless you want to hang out with the crowd here, or need some new clothes to fit your new nose or new chin, I don't think this place offers much for the casual traveller."
37,5.0,"A 5 minute taxi drive from the Ritz Carlton hotel in Gangnam, where we were staying, found us on a very popular tree lined road at 11 am along with the first shoppers of the day beginning to see what might be of interest.This street is popular with tourists and locals alike and provides a great range of high street names and local boutique fashion and accessories shops.There are a lot of coffee shops and restaurants in the area and quite a few 'outlet' and ""pop up"" stores with - when we visited - some really good prices.More than the shopping, however, a visit to Garosugil is well worth the trip for the people watching alone. The style of the local fashionistas being very much on display."
38,4.0,"Good place to shop along a pretty ginkgo tree-lined street. This street must be extra beautiful when autumn sets in and the ginkgo leaves turn into fiery red. Garosu-gil has nice cafes and boutiques. Do take time to wander around the backstreets because there were plenty of interesting corners to see. Oh yes, since it's an upscale shopping area, be ready to spend more money than you should have (a small cup of fresh orange juice from Coffee Bean & Tea Leaves, set me back around KRW80,000)."
39,5.0,"Considered the ""cheaper"" version of Apgujeong, Garosugil is the place for younger, trendy crowds and those who wants to see and be seen. Has tons of artsy cafes and stores ranging from the usual fashion house (Forever 21, H&M) to those one of a kind vintage boutiques (9 Owls, Maki). There's an awesome small restaurant/cafe called Table Star (turn right after Smile Market, it will be on the left) which has a superb lunch set for only ‚Ç©12,000 that includes a salad, fries, a main course and a drink. Really delicious and worth it, we had to come back a few days later. The lunch set is only available weekdays but their other menu options are great too.Definitely worth going as it is such a laid back place and it's a pleasure just walking around. Be sure to explore the little alleys as that is where most of the gems are."
