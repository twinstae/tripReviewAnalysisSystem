0,4.0,This is a small amusement park in the bottom of SM Coex (somehow fit there) where you can learn about digestion. Unfortunately some of the information is in Korean only but there are lots of photo opportunities for you to have when you go in and explore. The discover Seoul pass gives you a 1000 won discount on the entry fee making it 8000 won. You also receive a question sheet to answer (in english). The park has a few staff walking around so if you need someone to take a photo it is possible. There are lockers nearby. The park is mostly a pleasant walk through various areas including photo perspective exhibits and it indicates in each area which question is answered by which area. Unfortunately the numbers dont quote match up near the end but you can figure it out. The final area has a small slide you can climb up to and a little house which you can enter. Theres also a funny little dance club. It doesnt require much physical fitness but one should be aware that there is a rope type bridge in the middle of the park so if you have trouble walking you may struggle. If you answer the questions right you get a little gift. I had a lot of fun with my friend at this place but a couple of the exhibits were worn out and old. The name in Korean is also a pun about poo lol.
1,5.0,It was a unique experience for exploring poop's world. It a really nice place for children and fun place for adult.
2,5.0,First of let me just say I recommend this place for any person who laughs at anything related to poop üí©. There is a nice view of a huge poop emoji and everywhere you go you hear moaning and farts üêò üí®. In all if you love poop and get a laugh out of it this is the place for you my friend.
3,3.0,"I was kind of excited about seeing what this thing was all about. There weren't many clues about what it is online and it looked like wacky fun. It still was wacky fun, but I was a little underwhelmed. The museum is very short. It's a handful of fart noises, badly translated poop wisdom (which probably made it funnier), and a few photo ops. It culminates in a trip through the intestinal tract in which you throw some exercise balls over your head and back at your friends in a series of dark hallways. At the end, you go down a near vertical slide. The attraction ends in about 15 or 20 minutes. It's worth checking out, but don't have high hopes."
4,5.0,"My friend and I were walking around Insadong, and literally followed little pictures of the pop emjoi on the floor/the sounds of farts into ""Poo Poo Land"". Most random, unexpected & hilarious place ever. This place is ridiculous and amazing. Seriously - just go. Most fun I have ever had at a ""museum""."
