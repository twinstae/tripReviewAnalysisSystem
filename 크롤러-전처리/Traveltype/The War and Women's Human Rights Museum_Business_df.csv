0,5.0,"First, be aware that some people refer to this as the ""Comfort Women Museum.""  That is the topic of the museum, but not its official name.  Also be aware that this is a difficult place to find.  Considering how little English most cab drivers in Seoul speak, you may want to get detailed directions from your hotel concierge before going here.  The museum is small, but well done.  Most of the displays are in Korean, so I really appreciated the audio tour that was included in the admission price--the audio is available in several languages.  I certainly knew a little about the topic of ""comfort women"" before visiting this museum, but I learned so much more after my visit.  What a tragic period of history.  Because the museum is small, you will not need more than one hour to visit."
