0,5.0,"An interesting bridge that attracts photographers, families and couples in love. You can watch the fountain show from a special area on the river bank, from the bridge, or by choosing a river boat trip."
1,4.0,"If you have time, it is worth enjoying the fountain show. It is very beautiful and there are a few different times it shows. It is easy to reach here by metro."
2,5.0,"Banpo bridge has 38 water pumps and 380 nozzles that could draw as much as 190 tons of water per minute from the Han river. The Rainbow Fountain operate between april and june and also between september and october every year. The show of water, lights, and music is very nice and has a duration of 20 minutes, running 4 to 6 times a day. If you are near the bridge at 8pm, 8.30pm, or 9pm, you can witness the show."
3,5.0,"I went to the south side of the bridge, by Banpo Hanggang Park, so I am not sure what the north side has.  On the Southeast side, there was a night market with food trucks and small vendors.  On the Southwest side you have “Some Sevit”(aka Sebitseom) and a lot of seating area.  There were plenty of food trucks.  Options included, fried chicken, steak, skewers, fries, pork belly, shrimp... I can’t recall if there were any desserts... my mind was centered on the fried chicken. 88chicken(??) had a truck there.  There seemed to be a never ending line, meaning it the line never went away.  The price was really fair for what you get. Though it was nice and crispy, there were some pieces that where the meat was really dry but a majority were the right texture and moisture level.  The vendors were your typical vendor that you see all over Seoul.  There was one performer while I was there but i did stop to watch as I actually didn’t even see where they were,  there was an area where it was dark where people could sit down so I think the performer was there...In front of Sebitseom, there are several areas that you can sit. There is an amphitheater-like area, which would have made a great stage for busking, but was completely underutilized.  There was an area with a some kind of structure that people used as benches, along with benches all over the park.  There was a nice open area that people used to do a little skateboarding.  Sebitseom has beautiful lit buildings with a nice backdrop.  It is nice to visit during sunset as the sun sets behind the three buildings. There was a beer garden and a convenience store with some tables setup outside to get a nice view of the rivier and Seoul(north of the river).  There are also some restaurants and a CNN cafe if you need something more."
4,4.0,"It takes some efforts to get to the park to watch the evening light-shows. From the Express Bus Terminal Station (Metro lines 3, 7 or 9), you walk out of Exit 8-1 and then straight for several minutes. At the junction (with Reborn City building seen on the left) you turn right, continuing for another 10 minutes or so towards the riverside. In the middle of the walk, you cross the road and enter a walk-tunnel which brings you to the riverside park for watching the light-show. Please research on internet for the show schedules. Each show lasts for about 20 minutes. Best to go there when the wind is not too strong as the water sprays get blown left and right by the wind ie not forming a uniform pattern."
5,5.0,"It's a 10 minute walk from Express Bus Terminal train station. Make sure you have a pocket Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi. Just in case you get lost--google map it. I got lost on my first try taking the bus from itaewon last year (for me, buses in Seoul is hard to figure out). This year I took the train. So much better. I stopped by a cafe in one of the modern buildings beside the bridge. The light show was cute. It was not spectacular, but it was good.

Next time I visit, I'll try the snack bars/convenient stores by the river."
6,2.0,"I took the bus over to Banpo Park to see the ""rainbow bridge"".  I like musical water displays so I definitely wanted to visit.  Unfortunately, it seemed like one side of the bridge was broken, then once it started it was rather disappointing.  The water sprayed out and each nozzle seems to be controllable to move up and down and change colors.  However, the colors don't really affect the water stream so they all look the same and you can barely see it.  The movements didn't seem to go with the music very well either.  The photos I saw online looked much better so maybe it was broken."
7,1.0,"It doesn't worth seeing. Luckily it was just a part of the river cruise, cause it would make me sad if I went only to see the bridge from the promenade. It doesn't look like a rainbow at all."
8,5.0,"I went there because it was rated No.1 night market of Seoul. The left side of the bridge is a large exiabition hall well known for its colourful rainbow lighting. The right side is the night market that providing delicous snacks and street food. Meanwhile, you can also seeking for some hand-made accessories such as ear rings and brackets. It is full of youngs and visitors. For me, it's the best night stroll during my stay in Seoul."
9,2.0,It's near Hangang Park. It's a place where youngsters go and chill out after work/ school. The musical fountain itself was a letdown. You could not see the lights at all and it was just streams/ jets of water with music. I stayed from the first show (8pm) till 9pm and I decided not to waste my time trying to see if the third show would be better.Shows are 20 minutes long.
10,3.0,"The riverside park was nice for picnic & hangout, also good place to watch sunset.There was a 'night market' when I went there. I think it's in conjunction with festival. a lot of food truck with various type of food. The water show somehow not as great as I expected but still enjoyable."
11,3.0,"The show or picture is not what you seen in google.  You know why? Because you are using your phone to capture it. However, i do manage to take some nice shots with my phone. First, you have to manually setup your camera setting. Lower the ISO and make the shutter time longer. Then it will have nice image on it.Instead of bring jacket for yourself. Hug the one who beside you( your friend or your lover ) while having beer and fried chicken( Korean delicacy) Dont you think it is a special moment while watching the rainbow waterfall?"
12,2.0,"I've seen the fountain show a couple of times and it just never lives up to anything resembling entertaining, inspiring, or majestic. It's just some water spouts and colored lights with crap orchestral music straining through the mist."
13,3.0,"A long walk from the subway stations. But the athmosphere here is lovely in late warm evenings, pack up some picnic food with you! I was unlucky because the show was cancelled due to bad weather(?) which I didn't notice at all - in my opinion the weather was perfect, but maybe the wind was too much?"
14,3.0,A bridge that have Rainbow Fountain. Should visit around late evening to see the fountain. Best place to see & shooting photo is at Hangang River Park.
15,4.0,"The bridge by itself is nothing much to behold.  It's just one of the many bridges that span the Han River and links the city's north and shores.  In fact, during the day, it's really a boring looking bridge.  But at night, the light and sound water fountain show makes it for a magnet for locals and tourists alike.  The show's not bad but don't expect it to be mind-blowingly spectacular.  Having said that, it's free, so pick a good spot on the shore and enjoy.  But if one has the time or inclination, watching the show from an after-dark river cruise boat provides a different perspective on the same performance."
16,5.0,"I went to Korea by myself.  So I came here by myself.  I might have been the only one that went by myself lol.  There are tons of people.  Families, friends and couples enjoy the park while waiting for the light show.  The light show was nice but definitely not as pretty as the pictures in google.  But still worth a visit."
17,5.0,"A place of music, community, and fun.  Happens on the last Sunday of the month, so fortunate to go!!!"
18,4.0,"Walked from Itaewon to see this bridge and was not disappointed. Beautiful sunset at the river then all the lights/fountain show. Lots of bridal couples taking pictures, very romantic."
19,5.0,"A beautiful site, visible from many locations on both side of the river.  We were on the south side of the Han River at Hangang Park, which is a lovely space with greenery, an amptheatre, other seating.   Since it was Chousek, we are also treated to a fireworks display.    Families, friends gathered, brought picnics and enjoyed the musical from the bridge fountain and the fireworks.   The bridge ""plays"" broadcasts many songs and the fountain  (which runs the length of the bridge on both sides) changes the water spray and the colors in time with the music.  The bridge has 38 water pumps and 380 nozzles on either side.Very pretty site.   There are also lighted ferry boats cruising the river and under the bridge.  These seem to be available from the northern shore, so we didn't ride one.    We could see Seoul Tower at Namsam in the distance.    Very enjoyable way to spend the evening and wind down after a long day of sightseeing.   Definitely recommend."
