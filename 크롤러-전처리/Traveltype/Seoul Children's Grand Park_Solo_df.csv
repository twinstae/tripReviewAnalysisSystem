0,4.0,"Last March I went there on a rainy day but the place was still beautiful, with cherry blossoms and tulips. Went there this time in early Nov. and the place was lit with autumn colors (maples and ginkgos). It was a sunny day. There were many children, mainly young students on school tours. Seoul children are so lucky, to have a lovely and huge playground with a zoo. For adults it is also great to spend some hours walking in the beautiful and tranquil park. The internal amusement park is located at a far corner hence it does not disturb those who love quietude. If you like children, this is a place to see them bursting out with joy and laughter."
1,3.0,"The zoo here is small but free, the one at Grand Park is much better. The greenhouse is nice. My favorite part of the park was the art collection made of recycled metal, it is a creative use of rubbish and fun-even for adults. There is a fairy tale area but probably non-Koreans will not appreciate it so much (it only explains the Korean fairy tales in Korean)."
2,4.0,It was raining so there were not many people in the park. Early April was the cherry blossom time and the visit was quite worthwhile despite the difficulty of taking photos (with the lens getting wet every few seconds). The amusement park was not in operation in the rain for safety.
3,4.0,"The park is huge with a bit of everything. The zoo is free and is a good size for small children to meet a few new species.When I was there, there to be a show (not free) but since everything except the price was in Korean, I have no idea if I should go see the show or not.If I only have a day or two Iâ€™d skip the park, but if you have time, the place is very relaxing."
4,4.0,I have visited this place several times during my years in Seoul and had to get in one more before leaving. The questionable rides with their knockoff paintings are a trip to check out.
