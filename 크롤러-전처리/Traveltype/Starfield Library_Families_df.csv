However we stayed for a longer than expected time, taking in the tall structures (3 in all) and how they have been categorised.There’s a whole lot of movement and noise (not your conventional library) and obviously Korean books make up 95% of all the books here.  Interesting to see that there are donated books -both by large corporates/ Foundations and by individuals.There is a very short write up to the library in Korean with a smithing (subtitled mainly) of English -which i had fed back to the information counter, was insufficient.Spoiler alert: middle to TOP layers are “fake books” according to the lady at the counter... don’t quote me coz it could be lost in translation; but frankly, it didn’t make much difference if that was the truth ;)"
1,4.0,The library is probably more for photo taking then books reading. Undoubtedly very instagramable. While it isn’t totally silent yet it is not noisy. Problem is that it is very crowded. Still glad that I came.
2,4.0,If your staying around the area in the hotels this is a good place to meet up if you lose each other. I came her with my family with 4 kids. Ranging from 9years to 7 months. We rested on couches and read some books to the kids so they could take a break from the heat.
3,4.0,"This library is very inviting as a place to sit and read for hours, or take photos.  Not sure if there are any English books, but there were all kinds of Korean books.  It's worth visiting if you want an Instagrammable travel photo."
4,4.0,"How books became an element of decor ? Well, that place is probably showing the way. If you are looking for literature, pass your way. But if you want to see people reading ""for the dummies"" while shopping, you won't be disapointed."
5,5.0,The library is located in department store so it's easy to find. It's really beautiful place and cool to visit. It's a instagram hot spot that you shouldn't miss.
6,5.0,"Smack in the middle of COEX mall, with no doors and all open access, you will find this monument to printed books. Natural light filters in from the ceiling and the sides of the mall (the largest below-ground mall in Asia), illuminating the gigantic bookshelves with carefully-placed books, giving a first impression of wonderment and spaciousness. Part library and part tourist attraction, it is likely that the tourists taking pictures outnumber the actual library patrons, though the patrons linger with a book in one of the many seats arranged in the hall, and the tourists snap pictures and move on. A cafe is conveniently located in the premises, for those who want something sweet with their reading. The concept is very interesting, as it appears like a space for boundless access to information. But in this day and age, when printed books are quickly being replaced by electronic media, this library is a work of art that could be interpreted in many ways by the diverse audience..."
7,5.0,"A library with giant bookshelves, what do you expect? Certainly an iconic place and must be visited! You can relax while reading a book here, of course you can also take dozens of photos. Its location inside a shopping place makes it quite comfortable."
8,4.0,"this was the main reason to why i went over to coex starfield mall. and boy was i disappointed. i was expecting like multi-leveled library but it was just a two floor library. don't get me wrong, it is quite the sight but i was expecting too much. it is good to see see, but that's about it. every around is using the spaces like a library"
9,5.0,"Being tourists in Seoul, we went to the Starfield COEX Mall primarily to to see and take photos of the huge Starfield Library. And, indeed it was huge, and photo-worthy. 5 stars."
10,5.0,"We stumbled upon this library inside the Starfield Coex Mall and we were quite surprised  with its eyecatching design and thousands of available books that rose all the way to the glass ceiling.  That ceiling also greatly added to the ambiance and let in lots of natural light during the day. Both Korean and foreign books were displayed here covering many different subjects and all could be retrieved for your reading pleasure.During our visit, it seemed more tourists than book readers were present.  However there were a lot of different places to read and enjoy your book or sit back and people watch."
11,4.0,"The shopping mall is not close to the downtown area. It took almost 45 minutes to reach there by metro. The shopping mall is nice, with all sorts of shops one would die for in Hongdae (but a lot less crowded). The Starfield Library is as photogenic as it is shown in the photos available online, but most books are in Korean."
12,4.0,"The high rise bookshelves are very popular among instagrammers. The design of the bookstore with the high rise shelves is indeed interesting. Enough space to walk around, many chairs to sit and read books, a good place to relax in between shopping in the biggest underground mall in south east asia or maybe in the world."
13,5.0,"A very popular attraction in Seoul, this is a giant library in the middle of a mall - Coex Mall. It is an open public area where any one can go in freely, sit down have a break and relax, immerse themselves in books and other related materials. In the middle of the library is a tall art installation made of books? You don’t have to worry because there are lots of seating areas either on the ground or 2nd floor. There are even long tables on the ground floor and small cozy tables on corners in the 2nd floor where you can have a quiet moment to yourself. But with the thousands of books available you may think it will be difficult to find the book that you prefer. But each section is properly named as to the genre of the book. Don’t miss this out!"
14,4.0,simple and yet unique design must pay a visit to have a close up look into the concept and overall view
15,5.0,"We stopped by this library for only a few minutes to see it, but it was very impressive! Everything feels so open & it is very bright. There was abundant seating available for anyone who wanted to sit and read, or even just relax. Being in the mall, it wasn't as quiet as most libraries but it was very warm and inviting."
16,4.0,"Starfield library located inside Coex Mall. This mall is really big. Well, I can't say I enjoy my time here but still good to visit."
17,5.0,"We walked into Starfield COEX Mall and came across the usual shops, boutiques restaurants.....all very nice and attractive, and then we saw this truly amazing place. This huge library at least seven or eight levels high, stacked with books...books...and more books!! These days when bookshops are disappearing fast, this is really the place for book lovers. One can easily spend the whole day – there are places for sitting and reading as long as one wants. Wish there were more books in English – for tourists and visitors from abroad. It really hits you the first time you enter – definitely worth a visit."
18,5.0,"Headed out to Lotte world and walked through the library without expecting it and we were all blown away. It's one of the most beautiful library that I've set my own upon. It's not your average library because of it's art deco look, if B & N could have a book store like this in the U.S they would have a harder time getting people to leave. You can literally spend quite some time being there and enjoying the view and what it has to offer in it's selection."
19,5.0,"I've  never been in a library that is soo huge. We didn't get a chance to read nor look for books, but this is a place you don't want to miss if you will go to Starfield mall."
20,5.0,"Unbelievable to see thousands of books kept in this ""open"" library with awesome coffee shops in between."
21,5.0,This is an impressive library for the local. All the books are in korean but worth visiting. Have a cup of coffee and enjoy the decor and take lots of pictures.
22,5.0,amazing library inside the CoEx mall where tourists and locals gather to read and sightsee. there are tables for visitors to read through out the library. highly recommend.
23,5.0,"First of all how cool was it to have a multi storey library with elegantly stacked books in the central atrium of the CoEx Mall! and the mall itself houses the pricier brands, and so if you want to just do something indoors, this place aint bad at all!"
24,5.0,"This is unlike your typical solemn library. Given it is inside a busy mall, you can expect lots of folks walking in just to take pictures of this unique designed library."
25,5.0,We did not know its existence until we accidentally walked into it at the CoEx mall.  Initially we thought it was a book shop.  Later we realised it was a library with unusual display methods.  We spent 30 mins. admiring and taking photos at the ground and upper floors.  A must see in Seoul.  Entrance is free.
26,5.0,"This simply stunning library is situated in the huge shopping mall the Coex Shopping centre situated in Gangnam ,(famous for the song Gangnam style) it's such a picturesque very well stocked library.The whole experience of the Coex is very memorable and worthwhile."
27,4.0,this a gigantic high end mall with many levels and a wide variety of shops. But it is the central atrium - aka library that is amazing. With books stacked so high covering the walls for - i believe purely aesthetic reasons only. How would u browse the shelves if they were 3 metres high?
28,5.0,"We love to visit Libraries every time we visit different countries. This is one of the best so far, love the open concept of the Library and the setting too. You can casually walk in and feel free to sit down, they provide different types of sitting area to fit everyone needs."
29,5.0,"Beautifully designed library located within the COEX Shopping Mall. Nice to walk through and/or spend some reading or quiet time, and then back to shopping if that’s your thing."
