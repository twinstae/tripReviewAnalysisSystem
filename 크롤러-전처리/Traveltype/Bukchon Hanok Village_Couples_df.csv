0,4.0,Around half an hour walk from the major Palace. Its literally a private residence area. Quiet and the buildings are ancient built. Nice to tour but be careful it is a bit maze puzzle. You could easily enter into the village but not sure where and how to get out haha.
1,3.0,"A stone throw away from Changdeokgung Palace. Thus if one is nearby the vincinity, then perhaps might as well pop by for a look. Nothing much though except for some traditional looking houses and if short on time, its perfectly fine to give it a miss. Do keep the volume down as there are residents there."
2,5.0,"Nice place to walk even during winter with their cafes posted with pictures of owners. All vintage preserved houses become cafe, restaurant or coffee but some still occupied by the owners as houses."
3,5.0,Went here for the first time just to check out the place. It was a nice and serene place and not too hard to walk around (for the elderly and disabled). Highly recommend a visit just to take in the authentic culture of Korea.
4,5.0,"Just about 1 mile north (I think) of Insadong, sits a village you think whose time has passed. You would be wrong. The Village is a mix of shop owners, home owners & people who dress in period costumes while strolling through the quiet streets."
5,3.0,"This is my 2nd Hanok village in Korea. It’s not quite as immersive as Jeonju, it’s a lot smaller but it’s very cute set in steep streets with sweeping views of the city.People live here still! It will probably only take you 30 minutes to explore the village."
6,4.0,"Nice walk and interesting as well but as much to see as I thought,  in part because it is so popular making it difficult at times.Do stop at the Onion Cafe just before the start  - great little place."
7,5.0,"Bukchon Hanok Village is home to hundreds of hanoks, traditional Korean houses, that date back to the Joseon Dynasty. Love the cultural village and the architecture of the houses here, it is said that certain areas are to be kept quit when visiting as the people in this village love to preserve their serenity. There are some rich people whom stay here in this village. Many great scene and pictures with lovely scenery not to be missed."
8,4.0,"Good place to visit to see authentic houses (local people still stay there!). However, we visited on a monday and the traditional house for viewing (free admission) was closed. Pls also take note of the hours for walking around as it is residential area e.g. no walking around on sundays and only within a certain timing (9.30 to 5.30pm? Need verification- cannot remember the details). Look out for Chinese and English speaking tour ambassadors in the area who would be helpful to assist you."
9,5.0,"This is a residential area with hundreds of traditional Korean houses called hanoks. The area is open to visitors between 9 am and 5 pm. There are a number of alleys in the village through which you can take a walk. Though there are sign posts requesting tourists to keep their voices down so as to not disturb the residents, we found many tourists disregarding this. There are guards in the alleys who also keep making this request. There are lot of boutiques, souvenir shops and food stalls in the village. The walk was a very pleasant one and the architecture was unique. It felt like being a part of their homes and culture. A must do if you are in Seoul"
10,4.0,A nice quaint district to walk around observing the hanok architecture.  About 1km or 20mins walk from Gyeongbokgung Place.  Slightly hilly and good walking shoes are best.
11,5.0,Went to this residential neighborhood and learned about the history of the locals. The neighborhood has hills so be prepared but it’s not too challenging. Make sure to drop by at the coffee shop called onion. Fantastic baked goods and you can see the architectuee typical to this area.
12,5.0,This is one of the most wonderful suburbs in all of Seoul. You can get lost in the many streets up and down Bukchon. Check out the many trendy cafes and stop in at one of the delightful pubs or drinking spots. I’d recommend everyone visiting Seoul spend an afternoon in Bukchon! Love it!
13,1.0,Cringy tourists taking ridiculous photos here for their Instagram. Don’t waste your time here. More historic views/buildings elsewhere.
14,5.0,"Beautiful traditional Korean houses lined up this village, which is free entrance. Touring this Village, one has to be silent as these are residences and they don’t want to be disturbed understandably."
15,5.0,Well worth a walk up these streets of old South Korea. Interesting finding out people live there and how quiet it is. Great views of Seoul aswell
16,5.0,Love this area! I appreciate its calm and peace and the detailed architectural design of the houses. If you move out and head on to the roads you’ll see modern shops and cafes. Really cool place!
17,5.0,We had a couple of hours and we went there Hanok village for a relaxing stroll. We were not disappointed! The old houses are super well maintained and the view of the city's skyline mixed with the old houses was breathtaking!
18,5.0,We spent two hours and took lots of pictures. One day it will disappear. A very pictoresque area. A purely walking area.
19,4.0,Had a nice walk here. Full of shops and tea houses. Some sold traditional handcrafted items. Would recommend it.
20,4.0,Narrow streets with more traditional korean houses. Very crowded with many tourists though. Few souvenir shops and a couple of cafes.
21,5.0,"The village is close to the main palace, set close to some trendy shops and cafes.It's a great place to wander and get lost.It attracts a lot of tourists so worth remembering this is a residential area and the locals deserve to be respected. There are people around trying to get people to keep the noise down and stop you from entering the doorways of houses."
22,5.0,This was really enjoyable walk to the top. There's a lot of unique shops at the bottom and a Cafe at the top that has a 5000won entry fee as it doubles as an art gallery. Be careful not to slip if it's raining and note there are a lot of signs to keep quiet as it's a residential area and even people enforcing the silance. Families with loud kids take note
23,5.0,"We rented the Korean traditional outfit, Hanbok and wore it at Bukchon Hanbok Village. It was a scorching afternoon but certainly a great experience  of being like a Korean for an afternoon. This activity is recommended to people who are looking to immerse in Korean traditional culture!"
24,4.0,"Lovely neighborhood with privately owned hanoks.  Start out at the Tradional Cultural Center and pick up a free detailed area map.  The Cultural Center has restrooms and displays of typical hanok houses that you can peek inside.  Shops and restaurants are along the way although on a Tuesday morning there did not seem to be many places open but the crowd was also sparse.  Signage is good at helping one find the way.  Some of the streets are steep.  We took the metro getting off at Anguk Station, exit 3."
25,5.0,"This is just gorgeous, it is worth the steep and long walks, a lot of empty, narrow and cute sidewalks and streets great views and great spots for photos. This is an amazing area to feel the traditional Korean culture."
26,3.0,"We went on a very hot day, after reading our tourist guide we found our way there very easy , but how disappointing, the normal cheap tacky tourist shops at the entrance , and then what looked like new houses trying to look old , very steep hill going up , nothing really to see, big disappointment .Glad I never paid a guide to take us there ."
27,5.0,"According to data by the Bukchon Traditional Culture Center, 30,000 people visited the area in 2007. However, after the village was featured in television programmes, such as 1 night 2 days and Personal taste , the number rose to 318,000 in 2010. In 2012 the figure is expected to double to more than 600,000.During the Korean War, in between 37°N and 38°N was totally destroyed particularly Seoul and this old village was the only refurbished and awarded by UNESCO for their effort to resurrect the Korean Cultures.Due to too many tourists overwhelmingly the neighborhood, Sunday was closed. Although this is a must place to visit but is not worth the while for hours of walking around. However, there are a number of good restaurants nearby that you must try and perfectly blended into your tour schedule."
28,3.0,"This was part of our tour of South Korea and Mongolia..The village a good spot to see traditional Korean homes, but it does involve a fair amount of walking.  These are occupied dwellings, so one can only see the facades and roofs of the houses."
29,4.0,Bukchon Hanok Village is located to the east of Gyeongbokgung and I guess in the olden days the houses here would be likely to be owned or occupied by people who worked in the palace.This is a charming village with old Hanok houses and some modernised houses. It is a residential area so there are signs and staff reminding tourists not to talk loudly.Some boutique shops offer hanbok (Korean dresses) for rent so you could take pictures wearing the traditional dress.Some sections are quite steep so be aware.
30,4.0,Wandering the streets and alleyways of the Bukchon Hanok Village is both entertaining and educaitonal and helps one appreciate classic building methods.
31,3.0,"I heard so much about this place I had to go. The issue for me is I was expecting a self contained village of original traditional style. The buildings are styled in the traditional sense but they are mixed between modern apartments and houses. There is really only one street with the same style of housing and the sight of air conditioners, wiring and hot water services detracts from the traditional aspect. There are attendants at each end of the street holding signs asking people not to make noise as this disturbs the residents. There are a few souvenirs shops and some very modern cafes in the village. Pleasant to look at overall but nothing like the promotion given to the area."
32,4.0,Beautiful place to be. Great view from the top of the hill. I heard a the place is popular for filming Korean TV dramas.
33,3.0,"There’s no clear path to follow through this traditional village in a sense that, you just wander through the streets but aren’t told where to look or what to look at. We found this didn’t allow us to properly engage with the location, and as a result we most likely didn’t get the most out of our visit. Some of the houses you see will be the most beautiful in the entire city, but it’s still hard to distinguish what’s what here."
34,4.0,"Really enjoyed the walk around this hilly neighborhood. Clearly it’s gone thru changes and you’d need some money to live here, but the mix of new and old and the views made it a great tourist experience"
35,5.0,"Beautiful area on the hill with small alleys, many still inhabited traditional korean houses (Hanok). Need a bit of hike and from the top of the village we can see good view of Seoul. A must visit attraction in Seoul. Quite crowded with tourists, but still can find some quiter areas."
36,5.0,We like it here nice and relaxing and quite too you can walk around here and outside have a lot restaurant and shopping too
37,5.0,A nice romantic local korean village. Walk in korean costume to have great photos!!Also has lots of small restaurants to try.
38,5.0,"We were lucky enough to walk through the streets to the less crowded ones and come across the Bukchon Observatory ... when no one was there. It was 3000 per adult, which included a beverage and a balcony to sit and contemplate the scene and passage of time of the 600 year old village below. We enjoyed tracing our way up and over the hill and admiring the detail of the homes while respecting the privacy of the residents in the area who are constantly faced with the selfie stick / Instagram crowds chattering away and blocking the streets or posing with private property rather than simply enjoying the architecture and vibe of the area."
39,4.0,"Was glad to have been accompanied by a guide who explained the background to this “preserved” area and the various anomalies of ugly, more modern buildings whose time, thankfully, may be up soon"
40,3.0,"There is ther famous 8 views of the village. You can definitely skip most of it. Or at least i did. Be prepared to climb slopes. The place is still a residental area, so keep your volume done. Too many tourists to take nice photos."
41,3.0,"I read from previous review that some people got lost when they walked to Bukchon after visiting Gyeongbukong Palace.I suggest that after visiting Gyeongbukong Palace, head towards Subway Gyeongbukong Palce, leave exit 2 and head to Tosochok for the famous ginseng chicken for lunch. After lunch taking the subway 1 stop to Anguk and take the exit to Bukchon. Walked on the main road northwards for about 5-10 mins. You will reached the obvious entrance of the village on the left. Do remember to cross over to the other side and see the other parts of the village. By the time you walked over the other side you will be near Anguk station again. Please use Waver map in Korea. Goggle map can still used but not accurate."
42,5.0,Perhaps a 30-minute walk from Gyeongbakgung Palace is the historical village of Bukchon Hanok Village.  This extraordinary village is made of up homes from the traditional style of Korean homes.  It is still a living village where people live so when you visit you must be respectful of the fact that you are on their residence.  The homes are gorgeous and truly bring you back in time.  Where comfortable shoes are the streets are hilly and you need to be in good shape.  Well worth a visit for a few hours.
43,5.0,"This is an interesting area to visit, especially on a Sunday when many local people dress in their national costume.The walks are easy and there are some cafes etc on route."
44,3.0,The village is not so great. Only a small part is beautiful and good for taking photos. Other than that nothing much. I think Jeonju will be much better.
45,4.0,"Is about 10 mins slow walk from Anguk Station Exit no. 2. Is a residential place. Therefore do keep your voices low so. as not to disturb the locals. Not suitable for elderly as there is quite a fair bit of uphill climb. We went in early afternoon and there was not much crowd. There were little shops, cafes along the way. Is a serene walk."
46,5.0,This place is very popular because of the renowned korean moviescenes. Very interesting to see. Along this place are great food and restaurant.
47,4.0,"Lots of uphill and downhill slopes. The buildings are old school. There are many little shops and coffee/dessert restaurants. It’s a nice stroll around the area. I got a nice fedora for 10,000."
48,5.0,Really enjoyed the scenery at this village as it encompasses the traditional houses built during the Joseon dynasty. The area is really large and some of the houses are open for public viewing.
49,4.0,"it was a nice walk at 8am in the morning before tourists starts crowding the neighbourhood (we did not know that tourists are only allowed to visit after 10am, sorry)."
50,4.0,"According to the 1906 data, it was a gathering place of houses of 'yangban' and bureaucrat.높은 곳에서 한옥들과 저 멀리있는 빌딩을 보고 있으면 묘한 기분이 든다.실제로 주거하시는 분들이 있으니 큰소리로 떠들거나 쓰레기 버리는 행위는 삼가시길.."
51,4.0,"If you’re into history and old traditional buildings, you should add Bukchon Hanok Village to your travel itinerary. Imagine yourself walking through the streets of Korea dating back 600 years. The houses are well maintained with various gift and coffee shops if you need a break from all the walking. If you’re into Instagram, this is where you get the iconic picture of the traditional streets of Korea. There are no cost to visit this destination. However, bring you’re tennis shoes as there’s lots of walking involved."
52,4.0,"Beautiful place with a view!preserved in very good style! very much watched by tourists because for every building there is a sign ""do not enter"" the fact that people live there makes people find it more interesting!"
53,5.0,Buckchon meaning North Village is in fact a residential area with all those traditional Korean old houses. It’s amazing and looks like a film set. We managed to get hold of a map of the area and explored it on our own.  There’s a few uphill streets to climb but well worth it.
54,5.0,"Had a nice Sunday walk around Bukchon Hanok Village. Being between the two palaces, you can do all three in the same day. Would come back and would recommend to friends."
55,5.0,"To have less awkward walk towards the village and Gyeongbokgung, better choose the hanok rental place near here. You need to be quite around this village to respect the people living in the area."
56,5.0,This is a very nice place to visit and I like the architecture and the feeling there. It is still a residential area for the locals. I love to take pictures here. Except there are many tourists and hence lots of photo bombs ：）
57,4.0,"We took the subway to Anguk station to Bukchon Hanok Village after visiting the Gyeongbokgung Palace and enjoyed an uphill stroll into the traditional village. All the homes are built as low rises with unique roofing characteristic of architecture from 600 years ago.  Unless waiting for a unique photo opportunity of the horizon during sunrise or sunset, I would not spend too much time here as there isn't that much to see."
58,4.0,"This is a traditional village close by the centre of Seoul. Whilst it is quite nice to be able to walk around these traditional houses, it is clear that the hordes of tourists have ruined this area. There are guides around that make it clear you should not be disturbing the peace of the people who live there. However, it is a nice place to walk around as you will be able to get some awesome photos of the unique architecture of Seoul. If you get a chance to find them, there are lots of little tea shops around and you can enter to take a breather from walking around!"
59,5.0,I liked this village because of the old houses and relaxed atmosphere. Lots of little galleries and activities to stop at and learn more about the Korean culture and history.
60,5.0,"Very much enjoyed walking around. Very pretty, so many  unusual doorways, locks etc to photograph, so I took lots of photographs, many enhanced by young people in traditional dress. Not to be missed. I felt sorry for the residents, as despite notices everywhere asking people to be quiet, not many people took any notice. With three days notice, you can get a free guided tour from a volunteer from Seoul city government.Can reach by Metro line 3 to Anguk, exit three"
61,4.0,"A place where you’ll see a glimpse of Korean traditional houses called “hanok”. There are actually residents staying in the houses so tourists are advised to lower down their voices. It’s a steep walk so elderlies may tire walking up the lane..most of the houses have walls so you can only see the front gates or doors and rooftops.. if you’re in a tight schedule, you can skip this place."
62,5.0,"You can rent traditional dresses and visit the neighbourhood dressed with it. It is a very good idea. We saw very old and pretty houses, well renovated. And the area also offers stylish shops and restaurants which we visited during our 60 minutes there."
63,3.0,"It is good to know the infrastructures and culture of the old seoul but it is quite tiring to walk through the slopes, not really suitable for old people. Snaps some nice photo and have some tea at the tea house will do."
64,4.0,"I took the subway to go to Bukchon Hanok Village. Stopped at Anguk station and walked around 300m to reach the village. This is where you can find hundreds of beautiful traditional houses which date back to the Joseon dynasty. These traditional houses operate as guesthouses, restaurants, tea houses, and souvenir shops. A good place for a calming evening stroll."
65,5.0,This is a place where visitors should visit. It has a very long history and located in between Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung. This village was traditionally the residential quarter of high-ranking government officials and nobility during the Joseon Dynasty.
66,4.0,"It was pretty nice seeing the people were able to preserve the styles of their houses, and the vibe of the street even though south korea is a first world country. Fitted along antique doors however, are electronic doorbells and other high tech gate control systems, which parks the residents' kia and hyundai vehicles."
67,4.0,"Well, touring Bukchon on pedicab is quite interesting but seeing the young chap peddling so hard somehow made you feel a little awkward. It’s not cheap so I hope he is well rewarded for his hard work.Apart from that feeling, seeing the village on pedicab is quite enjoyable! You could see things in slow pace as the “cab” weaving through the alleys where cars are not allowed!"
68,3.0,Toured the village with a group of students.  They provided some interesting tidbits on the buildings.  Generally all you can see is the outside of the entire village as the area is actually the homes of the local population.  Interesting visit but nothing spectacular.
69,4.0,"Great area to visit and walk around. Really pretty and close to the Gyeongbokgung Palace, Insa Dong and Jogyesa temple. Great free activity and would allow 30 min - 1 hour to walk around."
70,3.0,"There are multiple Hanok Villages scattered across Seoul. This was a convenient stop for us as it's near the downtown palaces and a ~20 minute walk to my hotel. Getting to the top most vantage point is quite a steep vertical climb, and footfall here is high. Many tourists will invade the residents' front porches to take photos for the 'gram, such that the residents have put up CCTVs and signs to protect their privacy. There's another on the Seoul City Bus Tour that may be more comfortable and convenient to get to. The architecture there also seemed nicer there from street view."
71,5.0,"Just walk along the road deep inside the Village.You will find traditional Korean tea houses, restaurants, and item shops.However, be aware of the residents. They dislike too loud voice."
72,5.0,Went to Bukchon and be amamzed bybthe traditional houses still situated in the city. A lot of famous korean dramas and movies are made there as the palace is still well maintained. Nice sunset if you go at the right time.
73,4.0,Strolled through the village following a recommended walking tour provided by a tourist info center. Charming traditional houses. You could go inside a couple of them. Some areas with shopping & restaurants. Many people wandering about in traditional Korean dress added to the experience
74,4.0,"People actually live here, so it's best to mind your manners and your volume. If you reside here, you wouldn't be pleased with noisy uninvited tourists either.If you have time, check out the Baek In-Je House Museum. It's worth the time and it's free (with clean toilets by the entrance)."
75,3.0,Bukchon Hanok village is confined to just 2 streets of main bukchon. It is limited Hanok houses as compared to Jeonju Hanok village which is world UNESCO site. Some of these houses are converted to guest houses for rent.
76,3.0,"Well there are some really nice old houses in the area, but there are hundreds of tourists as well. As the area consists of just some little streets it is absolutely overcrowded. There are several people from the tourist bureau holding up signs „quiet please“ because it is a residential area and people do live here. Well, I am sure on one hand it is an expansive neighborhood, but I would not love to have a house in those streets with hundreds of tourist passing by each day.So basically: as described by someone else already: overrated, not really worth to go."
77,5.0,"You probably know what you're expecting to see when you get here. We also came here to shop at Gentle Monster's flagship store at Gyedong-gil. The store has been converted from a bathhouse. They have preserved the history by merging the design. Tiled floors, bathtubs and the fragrance!! Must visit and shop at if you're a Gentle Monster fan!"
78,4.0,"I really enjoyed my time wandering the streets at Bukchon Hanok Village, but I felt it was a little to touristy. There were crowds of people walking up the hill to get here, and shops near the entrance, with groups walking all over the place. Sometimes, I actually felt bad for the people that live in this village. Put that aside, the majority of the small houses here were traditional and cute. Some of the hills and alley ways were a climb, but made for great photo opportunities. I did not have a plan and just walked around the village looking at the interesting architecture. This village is well worth a visit, but don't treat it like a tourist destination."
79,4.0,Yeah our tour guide took us here and it was great to see how the old houses were built and you have to great view of the city
80,4.0,We appreciate walking through the streets of the village and visting the traditional houses. we did it withto a guide from seoul city for free and it was really interesting to understand how south Korean used to live.Nice photos from there. Recommend it during a stay in seoul
81,4.0,Its a very nice and little village of Bukchon where you can still see houses of the old times. Stroll along the streets of bukchon village and take a beautiful picture around
82,4.0,Always nice to walk but it does get very crowded nowadays... Lots of tour groups. Nevertheless I love walking up from Anguk side and finishing in Samcheongdong.
83,4.0,"Great for leisure walks, there are different activities offered. You can rent Korean dresses and walk around the village."
84,4.0,"The Hanok Village is an old heritage village. There are a few very old houses remaining.The village is a 20 minute walk from the Palaces and Museum .The area has become very commercial with a lot of modern ""made in Korea "" shops and a lot of restaurants.A good way to spend the afternoon ."
85,3.0,"Neighborhood that has a right to limit the tourists. After wandering for an hour and seeing the area overrun by tourists and tour groups, I feel sorry for the locals. To experience the Hanok Village there are better when you won’t be a bother to people trying to live their lives."
86,4.0,"This area is a short walk from the Gyeongbokgung Palace and can easily be combined with a trip there. There are many interesting little back streets with craft centres, workshops, ceramic shops, and traditional architecture, as well as plenty of places to eat. Do visit and see another side of Seoul."
87,5.0,"Lovely charming village with lots of photo opportunities. Bring you away from the city of Seoul back to the old traditional houses of Seoul. Very residential, thus should be  sensitive of one's surroundings when walking around. First stop - go the Bukchon Traditional Cultural Centre to understand the past and present of Bukchon Hanok Village and get a walking guide map. Follow the walking guide on the map and it will bring you to many lovely finds.Be prepared with lots of walking and go with a pair of good walking shoes to go upslope, steps and down-hill.Throughly enjoyed the visit !"
88,5.0,"Crossing the street to this area transports you to another world. Slow, prim, old world charming.  Enjoy the small stores around"
89,3.0,"Rated highly as a must do but I didn't really understand what all the fuss is about. Bukchon Hanok village is a pleasant place to explore for an hour or so. The house are pretty and situated on a number of steep hills, with a main street selling refreshments including some great non-dairy ice cream. The village does feel too touristy though and it's not that easy to photograph, unless you have a wide angle lense."
90,4.0,"Beautiful traditional Hanok village but very hilly! You need strong legs, good walking shoes and lots and lots of water!"
91,5.0,Very well preserved historical village. Lots of selfie opportunities together with hundreds of other tourists. Try to spend a night here in one of the traditional house. It is memorable.
92,4.0,A residential and tourist area full of Hanok (Korean traditional houses). Good place to take picture in Hanbok (Korean traditional clothing)
93,4.0,"After reading some guide books I have made this village a priority in my Seoul itinerary because this is a real village resided by real residents. Only when I read some TA reviews about real residents don't like interruptions by tourists did I start to hesitate. But our Korean friend who lives in Seoul said it's ok to visit during daytime on a weekday so off we go.A few alleys on a small hill make up the village. Two alleys are particularly pretty, and thus full of tourists. Yes there are signs asking visitors to keep quiet, some even say do not take pictures of the house or touch the door. I think this is understandable because this is a real neighborhood. I may do the same if I live there.I only took pictures from a little distance away instead of leaning on someone else's door. Nonetheless, I enjoyed a quiet stroll to admire the very well maintained hundreds years old traditional houses and soak in the atmosphere.Be considerate and enjoy!"
94,4.0,"We took on Bukchon Hanook on our hop on hop off bus tour. Was a lovely look into an ancient style village. Be aware this is a replica village, for some reason at first we thought it was a real village lol. Definitely Worth a look though. You can see a Taekwondo demonstration at about 1pm."
95,4.0,"We took a free of charge walking tour, from Seoul walking tours. We met at Unhyeongung Palace at 10.00 hrs. Spent some time in the Palace then walked up to the village, lots of nice tradditional houses and street views, bit hilly.......but you do need to work off your holiday food. Lots of art places, and good value restaurants. Lots of Koreans in traditional dress. Rained while we were there, dont bother with a rain coat get an umbrella like the locals."
96,4.0,The Hanok-village Bukchon is a traditional korean village in between the skyscrapers of Seoul an right next to the Gyeongbokgung palace. It‘s nice to walk around and see the traditional housing there. You can rent a Hanbok there and with this you‘ll get free admission to the palace.
97,4.0,"When visiting the Hanok Village, it is almost necessary to have a guide take you around! The hanok village is actually a residential neighborhood, and from what we learned, in recent years, the residents have not been happy with the increase in tourists visiting the area. The neighborhood is actually completely restricted to tourists on Sunday - but you wouldn’t know it unless you had a guide to tell you! Definitely hire a guide to take you through the hanok village - it’s definitely worth the money and you will get some great pictures out of it! Our guide, Matt from This is Korea tours, took us through the village and showed us the best spot for pictures!"
98,3.0,"This place was cool but there are lots of banners up saying tourists not welcome, as a protest from the residents. This made us feel a little uneasy! I preferred Gamcheon cultural village in Busan as it was more welcoming and had a stamp collection element which made it fun"
99,3.0,"The view points of Bukchon Hanok Village was not as scenic as I expected. Perhaps I started in the wrong direction and it was a long day after my 4 hour visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace. I gave up looking for some of the view points. Anyway, I’d like to share with you the route map of Bukchon Hanok Village. I think if you start from Exit 2 of Anguk Station and head to “View Points” 3, 4, 5, 7, 6 and 8 first, then View Points  2 and 1 you may have an easier time to find the View Points and will be walking downhill. I started with View Points 1 and 2. From View Point 2 to 3 was a rather steep uphill climb. Anyway this is just a suggestion. View Point 1 - Panoramic view of Changdeokgung Palace was a disappointment."
100,5.0,"Close to subway Anguk station (line 3). We spent 2 hours walking around ancient Korean houses . Very unique style of the buildings and amazing atmosphere. We traveled in the mid of August and the weather was super hot, but still enjoyed our trip to see this village"
101,4.0,"Perched high above the more modern streets below, Bukchon Hanok Village is best visited during the summertime at dusk, basking the low buildings and their details in a soft glow. Per other reviewer comments, some locals don't like the attention and have signs begging people to be respectful and quiet; a request I was happy to oblige. However, given the world's most populous nations have yet to travel to Seoul en mass, my best advice would be for those unhappy with the noise some tourists can bring to sell up now. Regardless, there are plenty of great photo opportunities for the curious traveller, as well as some shopping opportunities and cafes hidden throughout. A good access point is from Samcheon-Ro, which runs north-east from the eastern side of the Gyeongbokgung grounds. Follow the sidewalk maps and signs until you find a narrow, steep staircase disappearing between the cafes and houses (Google maps: 37.584644, 126.982128 .) Climbing the staircase you'll soon reach a street overlooking Samcheon-Ro below, with views back to Gyeongbokgung. Follow the signs carefully and you'll soon find yourself amid streets of stunningly restored and maintained homes. Follow the streets in an easterly direction before gradually following the twisting, turning narrow streets downhill in a southerly direction. A dusk visit will also avail you to some great dinner opportunities as you approach Yulgok-Ro."

Take a map from one of the guides and guide your way through.Along the road once you are out of the area you can find the famous O’Sulloc cafe where they sell all things green tea."
103,3.0,"Bukchon which means ""Northern Village""  is found north of two famous landmarks in Seoul,  Cheonggyecheon stream and Jongno. The Palaces surround this village (Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung and Jongno Shrine). In this village, you would be able to admire hundreds of Koreas traditional houses, called Hanoks. Aside from this Hanoks operating as cultural centers guesthouses, restaurants and tea houses for tourists to get to immerse themselves in the Korean culture, a lot of this Hanoks are still residential homes so make sure not to loiter and be too loud while going around the village."
104,4.0,"what should I say, yes it's old and traditional houses but imagine that a hundred year old house with a Lamborghini inside. nice house but not a must to see in Korea"
105,5.0,"Beautiful and good photo op. Nice quaint cafes and tea house along the roads. Go for this teahouse in the picture, offers some serenity & serves flavorful tea"
106,4.0,a village with amazing folk houses used by local Korean as dwellings; I agree that the residence were disturbed by tourists.  I would suggest tourists visiting Namsangol Hanok Village instead.
107,4.0,"We found this place thru Air bnb. Very traditional lodging from the Jeosun dynasty. Reminds me of the traditional ryokan of Japan. The property is situated on a hill slope and built like terraces. There was a cellar basement room, 2 bed rooms, sitting room end a kitchen and toilet. It was made mainly of wood.We slept on futon mattresses. Quite comfortable. The place was comfortable with air con in each bed room plus the basement. The home was in traditional renovations of main wood and wooden floor. The modern part was the bathroom toilet and kitchen. The feel and experience is really authentic and we are happy with the choice of having this accommodation in our first of 3 segments to soak in the korean culture and history. From this home we can walk to gyeonbakkung palace which is anotger historical sight within the city. There is also the subway station. Around the whole village, there are many little shops offering a wide range of shopping and food beverage options.The only downside i believe is walking back to the home after a full day outing! It's quite a climb but manageable on paved little roads. Take a look at some of the pictures posted. This place is really very popular with many tourist and even TV crews spotted outside our home. Some tourist even thought we lived there and asked if they could come in but we had to decline as it was not our but someone's private property."
108,3.0,"Really liked Bukchon the first time I visited but not this time. It was very touristy both times so nothing new but it was the banners around the village through which locals expressed their anger at tourists and how they are suffering through tourism which put me off. While I understand how constant flows of noisy, disrespectful visitors can be oppressive, it's really something they need to work out with the tourism authorities to find a solution rather than hang out insulting messages. Also at the end of the day, it's no big deal. It's quirky and quaint but the hanok buildings can be seen in other areas outside of Seoul. So if you are going to be going off the beaten track in S Korea it's not really worth visiting Bukchon. Its location between the 2 most popular palaces in Seoul make it an inevitable stop though. So if you do visit, be prepared for an unfriendly reception and try not to piss the residents off more by talking and laughing loudly (as we saw some inconsiderate visitors do)."
109,4.0,"Seoul must change a great deal from the old days, so it's kind of fun to walk among the old building from the bygone area, narrow streets have some interesting cafe and shops, Korean folks still live here, please speak low, try not to make any noise, not to disturb their daily normal life."
110,5.0,"There are many shops, cafe, restaurants in this area and the pretty old houses!! People are actually living in the old style houses, so you should have a respect to residents when you are going around. There are some overview spots which you have to pay but the view is pretty!! The streets are up and down, so it will be better to wear comfortable shoes!!"
111,4.0,"When in Seoul, you must visit this lovely village. Clean , neat , well laid out. The houses of era gone past. lovely botique shops. You may be lucky to spot women dressed in traditional wear strolling on the roads & lanes.An enchanting experience"
112,5.0,"Walking there was a fantastic experience, for ambience and architecture. Lots of people rent traditional hambok clothes and stroll free there (this gives up an interesting flavour to te scene). The owners of the houses are not happy with the huge ammount of tourists every day,. but have definitely to cope with that.."
113,5.0,The walk was a beautiful but left us bit in down as on many places one can find posters asking tourists to leave - it is a residential area that is crowded by people yelling and taking pictures
114,4.0,Small remnants of a village can be found here in the center of Seoul. Try to have a Seoul map with you because korean people are not able to speak even a little english but they are extremely kind and polite.
115,3.0,"Although it was nice to see the village and the houses, I personally didn't think it was a must see or do. If you have a limited amount of time in Seoul then you can skip this village. It's just a  bunch of traditional houses that most locals still live in. If your really into taking pictures at a traditional village then go ahead but be aware that not everyone's house want people in-front of it. I only recommend if you have a lot of time or extremely interested in an old town."
116,3.0,"Typical old village with ancient houses, not many activities to do here. The view is also not really impressive. Can skip if you don't have enough time"
117,4.0,"Stayed just next to Bukchon Village which I can highly recommend as you will not have a ton of tourists there early morning so if you are an early riser and wants to get in some nice photos before the crowds come, you should stay here. Overall, the traditional area is pleasant, and scenic. plenty of small cafes and craft shops. Taking a stroll here is a must if in Seoul."
118,4.0,Went there from gyeongbokgung palace and the village was lovely but beware of steep hill. Lovely place to live but they suffered a lot of noise from tourist and now banning tourist from entering their village since they live there and lots of ppl means noise.
119,2.0,This place is so adviced by hides but I was actually a little disappointed by it. The place is residencial you walk around houses and go inside but it doesn't feel so traditional compared to other place in Korea.
120,3.0,"Surely you must visit to get a good impression of the originaliteit houses of old Korea.IT can be crowdy, thats also the reason that the inhabitants are not happy with all this visitors.Korean people can hire orginal cloths to dressed up.It is a nice view"
121,5.0,We thought this place was near or in Insadong but we were so wrong. The nice folks at the tourist Info sorted us out so we legged it there and carried on legging it. It's a nice mix of old albeit refurbished and new. Lots of photo ops around so let the inner photo maniac rip!
122,4.0,"We caught the Subway Line 3 to Anguk Station (Exit 2), walked straight about 250 meters to the village. Walking up the hill you will find many traditional houses that appear to have been kept in very good condition. Well worth the walk up to the top of the hill where you will see a nice view over park land and the city toward the Changdeokgung Palace. I'm pleased we made the effort while visiting Seoul."
123,4.0,"There are signs all over that this is a residential area and to please be quiet, refrain from,smoking, etc.   Charming old style houses set within the city.    There were a couple places which had, for a fee, traditional art workshops.  A number of tourists chose to rent traditional outfits, hanboks, at nearby stores, to walk in costume thru the area."
124,3.0,"I will admit the neighborhood is cute and the houses are beautiful. I’d like to say go there if you have time but the local residents are very opposed to the tourism and have hung a huge banner stating tourists are not allowed and are ruining their community. As we walked around I could understand their point. Despite the signs to be quiet and respectful, most tourists weren’t. There were crowds of people talking loudly, being obnoxious, kids were running screaming down the street with parents yelling after them. Worst of all, people were climb onto the doorsteps of the houses to pose for pics. I’d be mad too if strangers were literally at my front door everyday."
125,5.0,"This is a nice area with beautiful old traditional houses. But many visitors do no behave properly. Remember, this is a residential area. Be quiet and considerate and respectful. Come on your own and spend 1-2 hours. Don’t book a tour. These kind of things should not be exploited commercially. Big groups block the roads and the front gates of the houses. Just imagine how you would feel if hundreds of visitors would walk around in your street, taking photos of your house and blocking you? Be considerate, it’s easy and rewarding. If this was helpful in any way, we appreciate a like. Otherwise we’ll never know whether anyone reads this."
126,4.0,Enjoyed walking in this neighborhood.  Not as commercialized.  Very nice visiting those old courtyards.
127,3.0,"Actually not a very fantastic place to visit. Can go take a look if have the extra time and energy, but do not expect too much from this tour. As this is a residential estate, be careful not to be overly excited or speak too loudly, or you risk getting scolded by the locals. There are residents patrol to look out for tourists especially those behaving badly. When we were there, we saw signs put up by locals to remind tourists not to speak too loud, not to touch their properties, and some prevent you from taking photos in front of their house."
128,4.0,"Bukchon village is a lovely area to walk around in this arts and crafts shops along with a nice atmosphere and pretty, old hanoks. Go to the information center for the area to get a map of the area showing where the good spots are."
129,4.0,"Very nice quaint neighborhood with lovely traditional houses, but there are signs at most of the doors saying 'keep out', 'don't touch', 'silence please', 'this is a residential area, muted talking' etc. I could not imagine living like this, I feel very sorry for the residents. This should maybe be a paid attraction with limited number of people, otherwise too much noise, but beautiful! Please keep your voices down when visiting!!"
130,3.0,"This arts and crafts area is about 15 minutes walk from Gyeongbokgung Palace. We walked through narrow streets and into grand old buildings that had housed traditional craftspeople for hundreds of years. The buildings were pretty nice, so we presumed the area must have been pretty wealthy. There were people that dyed fabric, people that gilded gold leaf items, people making traditional Korean knotted items among others. We were allowed to enter the buildings to look around and if we wanted to take a class there was a fee. It was interesting for a quick look around but not really our thing."
131,4.0,We went up to Bukchon Hanok Village and was really worth it.After visiting the main palace next door just take a stroll down to this typical Korean village were people like to dress up with the tradition Hanok and you can take amazing pictures.Lots of restaurants and shops will recommend to spare 2-3 hours to visit.
132,4.0,"Jst eats of the major palace complex, they have info guides on hand and maps to direct you to the major sights. Be prepared for uphill climbs. Also fairly steep downhill stairs to get back down (if you do not retrace your route up)."
133,4.0,"Hard to decide whether this is a touristy area that would rather not be or a homely village that gets invadedThe old houses are lovely to see in the narrow streets but our is people's homes and there are signs everywhere asking for peace and quiet, no peeping etc, so it felt a little uncomfortable at times knowing who behind the closed doors wanted us there and who didn'tThere are some that are 'open' to tourists, typically as a retail outletBut there is also an enormous number that are freshly refurbished"
134,5.0,"This is a very lovely area of the city, which is a nice walk from the palace. Here you can see an active neighborhood that has preserved it’s old housing. There is a steep incline, or stairway, to get to the heart of the Hanok village, but it isn’t too long and worth it."
135,4.0,We enjoyed 2-3 hours wondering around the streets in this area.  We started with a map but then just wondered down whichever road looked the prettiest! It does get busy but it is worth seeking out the quiet streets to enjoy the architecture without masses of people.
136,4.0,"I loved the walk in the Bukchon Hanok Village. It is such a peaceful and quaint and picturesque place. The place is residential and hence it is advisable to maintain silence. You can get amazing views of from the observation point. Make sure to collect the map at the information center. There are a few museums, Perfume gallery and tea houses and cafes along the way. Make sure you try the Korean tea at one of the cafes. The place where we went was a very cute little cafe / guesthouse and the hosts were so warm. The place was very old fashioned and antique looking. The hosts were very warm and friendly. They welcomed us warmly and the menu has variety to choose from. We went in for the traditional raddish tea and the berry tea called omija. The prices are pretty decent for the ambience and the experienc. It costed us less than 10000 KWr in total. The hosts are more than happy to take pictures for you and also suggest you good photo spots. The cafe name was in Korean language. I have attached the card for your reference. It was HoeHwaNaMu GuestHouse. It is a traditional Hanok House."
137,5.0,"If you want to see and feel real Korea, go to Bukchon village. It’s within a walking distance from the main palace. Wander the narrow streets, pass by traditional houses...find a hidden observation spot in one of them."
138,5.0,"Bukchon Hanok Village will bring you to the latest year of Seoul, the village here was so cozy and clean. many shop provided for tourist to learn the traditional way."
139,4.0,"This whole stretch of traditional houses nestles in between of busy roads. It can get very crowded though and very hard to get photo opportunities.When we went in december, one section was closed for filming (maybe it’s some korean drama) and the annoying part was there were cars passing by the narrow street. If you’re going to the palaces nearby, may as well visit here as it’s within walking distance (quite a long walk though).Not recommended for eldery or family with young children as the walk can be pretty tiring."
140,5.0,I really enjoyed this historic village as there are a lot shops that offer numerous choices for me to rent a hanbok and also they offered items with a good price. There are certain place and area that is very picturesque as a good choice for a tourist to take a good photo in this place.
141,5.0,It was facinating to visit a traditional village that has been so well preserved. There are many interesting exhibits as well as live performances of Koreans in traditional costumes.
142,5.0,So cool to see all those old houses. It is possible to peep into some of them and see what's inside. Also many old coffee shops
143,3.0,"If you are a lover of old architecture, you would love this place. It is also a nice place to capture lots of photos if you are wearing a Hanbuk bt overall it is just stroll to see the old village that has been modernize. We spent 1-2hours here while crossing from Gyeongbukgung to Changdeokgung."
144,5.0,"Happy to be able to visit this village. It was a great experience to walk thru the village and see how the older homes used too look like! It's such a beautiful place that, it is still home to families, so respectfully, do your best not to make any loud noises or try to open any doors, they also have signs on their homes that say the same thing."
145,5.0,"traditional Korean village where you are able to learn more about some of korea's history.many places of interests, gift shops and restaurants nearby.walking distance from subway so it's pretty convenient.quite a fair amount of walking required if you want to see more sights.tourists or locals can rent their traditional outfits for photo-taking.not sure on the rental prices or the duration cause my wife didn't want to wear them.but you can see many people wearing them along the streets."
146,4.0,first it is quite a distance to walk from subway..please board a village bus if you have difficulty walking.secondly it has a slope so high that one must rest on and off..very nice views of the old traditional korean villages.please note museum was closed on sunday when i visited..wasted trip.many tourist ambassadors wearing red helping tourists on how to reach destination.but i have problem looking for the observatory.gave up eventually..should try the other namsangol hanok village which is easier to locate.
147,5.0,"I loved wandering the narrow alleyways of the village.  It was great to see the traditional housing.  On the down side their were lots of tourist doing exactly what we were, but we found by ditching the map and just wandering, rather than following the crowd, it worked better.  It's an area of new and old houses, all in keeping with the traditional style.Important to be respectful as these are peoples homes and there was a lot of publicity about noise levels etc.There are some great cafes in the area, so we had a good mix of exploring versus coffee, food and wine!We ended up going down some steps and ending up in a really hip cafe/bar area which was a good find as well."
148,3.0,"While we visited the Gyeongbokgung Palace, we realized it was only a short walk to the Bukchon Hanok Village so we thought it would be a good opportunity to look at the traditional houses. First off, even in the middle of winter it was very crowded. Since the area is essentially just a neighborhood of new and old houses which keep the look and style of old Korean dwellings, to walk around is free. This attracts a lot of people as expected. What I personally found is that you don’t truly see much while you are there. Because you walk in and around streets and alleys you only really see roofs, walls and doors. Don’t get me wrong it was interesting but not what I expected. It is also more visually stunning than what pictures will ever be able to capture, so in my opinion take a few photos but don’t be worried about photographing a ton of structures. You can go in a few places that are now shops, but we decided to forego that process since they were mostly tea houses and I’m not a big tea drinker. Also the touristy shops on the main street are nothing to get excited about. The one thing we did do is find some great food in the neighborhood. We ended up at a great noodle and dumping house where we partook in both delicacies. It was amazing and for only 15,000 won (or a little less than $15 US) we were both stuffed."
149,3.0,It is an area to visit once and only takes about 10 mins since not too much to see.  The Ginseng Chicken Soup Restaurant is definitely a pass.  Not worth dining there.
150,4.0,Charming small streets in old town of Seoul. Easy to walk. Nice craft shops and cafe's. Close to CBD.
151,4.0,"It is like time stood still in some areas, a look into traditional Korean housing. Many Koreans walking around with traditional outfits make it even more authentic. Remember to keep your voice down as people live there, but provides great views and takes you around eventually to some nice shops."
152,4.0,This place is incredible beautiful. Even tho it was super cold we had a great time. Korea is not just kpop. A must go!
153,4.0,"It was something nice to see. There’s not a whole lot to do here except to see the old traditional houses. It’s possible to do a “korean experience” here, but was too cold when we went so didn’t stay too long."
154,5.0,"This is a very unique place to visit, but a little strange to be wandering in a neighbourhood and snapping pictures of actual peoples homes. Some are not too welcoming, but that is understanding. Be mindful and quiet as this is an actual community... Don't be the guys we saw, LOUD and posing for multiple pictures, etc. Great views when you reach the top too! One tip? There is a paid observatory, avoid it. Instead, walk around the corner and see the beautiful sunset for FREE!"
155,4.0,"Not a large area such as Jeonju, but an authentic living space. Easy to get to from the central Insadong area."
156,4.0,A great place to walk around and look at traditional houses for a couple of hours.  Make sure you get a map which takes you on a guided walk all around the village.  We got ours in one of the museums.  Lots of little shops and cafes around.
157,3.0,"The walk through the village was nice, but not much more than a stroll through traditional Korean homes.  Gives a good perspective of traditional homes, but very little shopping. A few places for tea."
158,5.0,The shop is a bit hard to find as it is located at the underground floor. It’s only three minutes walk to changdeokgung palace. Their service is very good and friendly. Price ok and have many types of hanbok for rent.
159,4.0,"One of the top tourist attractions in Seoul. Small houses with decorative roofs, traditional tea houses and small gift shops. A Korean TV show was filming when we were there.  Nice view of the city from the top of the hill."
160,3.0,"There's really not much to see here except houses in traditional Korean architecture. I went before lunchtime, so there weren't a lot of people, and the area was exceptionally quiet (there are signs all around saying to not make a lot of noise since families actually still live in the houses)."
161,2.0,"We were here as it's one of the must visit places in Seoul and we were anticipating to visit this village. We followed the map, and unfortunately couldn't find the exact location so we kept walking up and down the slopes until we saw a lot of other tourists and yup, that's the place. It was crowded with tourists and signs boards were everywhere asking passersby to be silent as it's a residential area. Wooden structures of the traditional houses were interesting but the crowds, the over expectations of this place and weariness of finding the right place just put off the excitements of visiting this place.Good for first timer to Seoul but don't expect too much."
162,4.0,"I was looking forward to seeing the old building. BUt this is actual residential homes, so you can only see it from the outside. And have to be mindful to keep it quiet. IT was also hilly, so walk is quite tough."
163,3.0,"There is no much to do but to walk and take pictures.  It was confused for us to find the starting point.  So we just walked from where we were, still not knowing if we have missed part of the route.  The houses are traditional and well maintained.  Must come here one time if you visit Seoul."
164,3.0,A nice village with old traditional Korean houses.  People live in them so it is advised to walk quiet. The roads are nice to walk along but it feels very touristy with many tourist aimed businesses at these houses.
165,5.0,We picked up a free map in the area of the Bukchon Hanok Village.  I would advise getting a map.  You don't need a guide.  The map and the staff will tell you the best route to walk.  It is pretty popular with tourists and some even rent the traditional costumes for photography.  Keep in mind this is a residential area so refrain from talking loudly.We enjoyed walking around and seeing the historic architecture.
166,5.0,"we could see really peaceful and traditional village in the middle of Seoul. It was fabulous to see skyscrapers in Seoul from the traditional village, such as a combination of modern and traditional one.I used the map I got from the entrance well since without the map, it is probably easy to get lost or miss some spots to see.There are some shops to buy gifts or beverages at the beginning of the village, so it was quite enjoyable!Also left side of the village, there are restaurants and cafes, so we could have a nice meal at there!One thing I was uncomfortable was that there wasn’t any trash bin on the street"
167,4.0,"Beautiful streets, but walking here is quite annoying because it's either uphill or downhill. They have stores here as well as food stalls."
168,3.0,"This neighborhood is close to Insadong, and approximately 15min walk from Gyeongbokgung palace.It was well-signed, so feel free to wander and appreciate this cute little neighbourhood. The contrast of old and new, busy and peaceful, modern and traditional of Seoul  It is an active residential area so there were signs to keep noise to a minimum.Cafes and little souvenir shops were aplenty. There were several public toilets too. The stroll can range from normal straight level to several hill slopes depending on which route is taken."
169,5.0,"Had a great time by taking a Seoul City Walking Tour of Bukchon Hanok Village - in total the duration was around 2-3 hours and the guide spoke extremely good English. We enjoyed it a lot, and definitely think we enjoyed it more than we would have if we just walked around on our own"
170,5.0,We have visited this village through a free walking tour and it was great. Tour guide showed us few unique architectural characteristics of the Korean buildings.
171,5.0,"Excellent in every way; especially if, like my girlfriend, you have a lifelong interest in wearing a Hambock dress which you can hire for around 20,000 KRW for 2 hours.  The buildings are mostly private so enjoy the authenticity in a respectful manner."
172,5.0,"My wife an I spent several hours wandering around here. A brief flurry of snow at the start of the day added to the occasion. We went to the museum first and the helpful gentleman there furnished us with a map, which was useful. We followed the suggested route. There are lots of nice old buildings, and plenty of photo opportunities.There are also several places where traditional Korean clothing can be hired, if you are that way inclined.Overall a wonderful experience! We loved it."
173,5.0,Such a cool thing to see while in the city that there are still old fashioned looking homes. They’re out of the way and somewhat easy to locate. They’re real homes that people still live in so make sure you’re quiet while visiting the Bukchon Hanok Village.
174,5.0,This is our first time exploring this place. We love their house building & their culture. They also have nice cosy cafes & restaurants. It's a must go if going to Seoul as we don't always get to see traditional house building & structure.
175,5.0,"This was a very pleasant area to walk around, lots of craft type shops and many smaller clothes shops. There a number of small museums in the village area including a typical Korean house.There were many local tourist guides around offering free advice and maps. Each time you came to a fork on the map a guide seemed to magically appear with directions, so efficient.Plant places to eat and drink in the area.Well worth a visit."
176,4.0,"We used the a Lonely Planet walking tour plan which was quite successful as we are both good walkers and not afraid of hills. The village is well preserved with many old houses with original roofs. It's sort of upmarket touristy, with not too many tacky souvenir shops, although several tourists were wandering around in traditional clothes they had hired taking selfies."
177,3.0,Small houses have been ‘preserved’ according to korean tradition. Beautiful handicrafts and aesthetic architecture but apart from that horde of tourists clogging up narrow alleys does actually take away the charm. Understably local residents would like tourists to be quiet as possible but the cacophony of increasing decibels can be unbearable. Definitely not for a second visit.
178,4.0,"We were welcomed by a very sweet and professional volunteer . She explained about the History of the village with so much fun. Then were brought to a room where she promoted their products. Wow, very expensive! Even the bottle of honey costs more than RM100."
179,5.0,"We loved visiting this street. The little shops are cute, and it is a great place to get a tea. Would go here again."
180,5.0,"This beautiful traditional Korean neighborhood is worth a walk through. It won’t take but maybe two hours or so out of your day, but is a quaint little place to see"
181,5.0,This is a great hilly area to walk around.  You get sweeping views over the tiled roof tops and also many traditional craft workshops and stores are to be found here.  Take the walk and also the area just south and east of it is worth the stroll as well.
182,5.0,"An  interesting sreet full of people during the Chuseok. Restaurants, cafes shops, life on the street.  This time also beautiful Korean national dresses."
183,4.0,It is good to see how living conditions were many years ago. Our tour guide was able to explain for better understanding to tourist. Many locals in the area due to holiday season. It a nice small village reach in history.
184,5.0,Recent history of Korea has been very tragic and many things have been destroyed by nearby nations throughout history. As such being able to view Bukchon through the eyes that this village allows us a glimpse into something that has been destroyed is enlightening. Going on a day in fall where the weather is nice and it is not busy is awesome. You are able to take many pictures with the scenic spots and there are quite a few cafes and shops to drop by as well. Overall I thoroughly recommend going here and keep in mind the tragic history of this area as well.For more on Bukchon check out my website in my profile.
185,3.0,"Nothing interesting, it just a few houses with korean traditional architecture. Prepare for lotsa walking."
186,4.0,It's a quaint set of alleyways where you can get to experience Korean lifestyle and architecture. There are quite a few street performances which is well worth a pause. A lot of shopping too from the general souvenirs to the more niche hat shops. A good place to while away an hour just to experience South Korea.
187,5.0,"A place worth visiting as it consists history of village residential, truly fascinating when walking and climbing the steepness hill along the residential. They're people living in that village, though its name as a village, rather, more on very much developed small town as compared to my hometown. There are a lot of steep climb along the residential area, I was just lucky because I've carry manfrotto along as had it setup steadily to avoid and beat the uneven road surface, gradient and etc. Spotted one of the houses' walls stacked up by raw bricks inside the village, taking advantage to make use of this wall to do our couple shooting. Many tourists doing their own smartphones shooting too, they were laughing why the hassle where smartphone already sufficed for the photography. I don't blame them, indeed smartphones' quality could be very good for photography, just that maybe I am still old school fella who still doing photography in an old fashion way."
188,2.0,"Located far from subway station, walk 15 minutes go uphill, and nothing than houses.. not my type of tour,"
189,3.0,The area was fine... seemed to be a popular area for white collar lunch break. We just walked around and took in the hustle of resident life.
190,4.0,"We walked here during our walkabout in the area. It is quite near Changdeokgung Palace. We arrived in the evening before it got dark.  Even then, there were lots of tourists.  As this was a residential area and people were still living here, there were signs asking people to keep their voices down when visiting.  There were several alleys you could wander about. It was quite interesting to look at hanok houses in the city and compare them with the many skyscrapers and modern buildings nearby. We left when it go dark."
191,5.0,Such an adorable neighborhood - charming with no commercial chain stores and love the local independent boutique business mixed with neighborhood charm.  Actually shopped much more in this neighborhood than others too.
192,4.0,Take your time and watch these beautiful houses very carefully.Most of them are really very beautiful.
193,2.0,"As a tourist looking for interesting places to visit, this area seems to be just old houses and narrow streets."
194,5.0,"It's a quaint little area with streets lined with houses from the olden days. We saw many people in Hanbok and decided to try. Inexpensive, starting from 10,000 Krw an hour plus optional add ons. As the streets were lined with Hanoks (traditional houses), the walk in Hanbok was made even more memorable."
195,5.0,If you are interested in historical architecture this is the place to go to.A large area of traditional Korean housing and buildings. Most are occupied so there are only a few that you can enter and they are either retail outlets or in one case a small museum. If you can go inside do so as it gives you a much better feel of the layout of these unique buildings.Gave us a great feel of Korea
196,4.0,"A shop owner where we had just bought some Korean tea highly recommended we come check out this area. Not sure why, we began our hike, I mean exactly that, a hike, because of the steep grade the streets are on. It didn't take long for us to see why it was essential we come see this place. Right next to busy, loud, modern downtown Seoul, you can find this magnificent old town where things appear to not have changed much for centuries. What beautiful homes, this is truly an architectural jewel in the middle of Seoul. Ladies, don't wear high heels! Wear comfortable shoes and take a jacket. Even it it's a warm day, it can get very windy and chilly once you reach the top. This is not appropriate for parents pushing strollers! We loved all the narrow alleys, the old homes that still look today as they did hundreds of years ago. It's wonderful to see how the locals take such excellent care of this old neighborhood. Just lovely! Take lots of photos, if the crowds let you. That was the only negative part of the time we spent here. It's so crowded at times, sometimes you have to wait long periods of time to find an alley or a façade with no crowds to take a decent photo. Enjoy your time here. It really is a must see! Pay attention to details in the craftsmanship of the structures, the wood carvings, the designs, everything! Absolutely stunning!"
197,5.0,"This is amazing place to discover while walking along the small streets, it is in the area of Gyeongbokgung Palace and Changdeokgung Palace, if you like to spend a night there you need to stay in guest house."
198,4.0,"It took me back -- way way back to my childhood.  I was very happy to see that the city tried to save the neighborhood.  Maybe because the weather was too hot, i didn't enjoy it as much as i would have.  There were some charming tea cafes which would have been good stops if i had more time."
199,4.0,Bukchon Hanok Village is a great place to visit to see when\\at Korean looked like in the past. The homes are beautiful and well kept. It's important to be mindful of the fact that people actually live in these homes. Wear comfortable shoes because it mostly narrow walkways that go up and downhill. Expect to see lots of people taking photos is tradition korean outfits.
200,4.0,This village provided a wonderful insight of traditional Korean life.  They were very clean and the local people were friendly.  It was really nice to see beautiful traditional clothes being worn.
201,4.0,While the houses here are the historic ones they are actually real houses that people live in so be wary not to make too much noise. Worth a visit if you are visiting the nearby palaces (can walk by foot). Check out the information centre to hear about the free house museum that's worth going to.
202,5.0,We stumbled upon this street while walking around the palace - it's a must-do. It's super cute and just wander around the streets and stop for a bite or a fun drink.
203,4.0,Good for a quick visit and to see genuine hanok houses that people still live in. Close to palaces so can wander through the village on the way to or from them.
204,4.0,The tourist infomation centres can provide maps to the more photogenic parts of the village. We also noticed map stands placed at various locations within the village.The tourists were out in force on the most photogenic street. Nearly every door and every wall had a sign reminding people to be quiet as these beautiful old homes are lived in by normal people. I don't think the signs were working.It was quite obvious that the hanbok rental places were doing very well in this area as we were vastly outnumbered by the hanbok wearers.Be prepared for some hill climbing.
205,4.0,This area is a great contrast to the modern city. Lovely old characteristic houses. Good for a nice walk around.
206,4.0,"We stayed in a Hanok in this ""traditional"" neighborhood. It is also a bit touristy but in a relaxed way. It is a sort of open air museum. A lot of houses are restaurants, shops or hotels now but it is one of the best places to relax and escape the frenetic pace of the city."
207,5.0,Need to climb small hidden stairs. Beautiful quite little traditional village. Must try their tea houses.
208,5.0,We went to this village on 29 June. It was awesome. Lots of cosmatic shops. We also had a local lunch at a Hanok Resturaunt. the food was delicious. Within Seoul it gives a flavour of village life. lot of school children were running here and there.Full of vibrant life!!
209,5.0,This would a must visit destination for those Korean drama lovers. To avoid crowds go in the morning as the tour groups tend to arrive by 11am. Please avoid making too much noises as these houses are still resided by residents. The top of the hill has a great view of the city. Also enjoyed traditional Woojeon tea at a traditional tea house. A street vendor also sold amazing fresh fried dumplings between Anguk station and Bukchon Hanok Village.
210,5.0,So nice to walk in this neighbourhood with those old traditional houses. Many people do hire the traditional korean outfit to visit this area. A pleasure for the eyes to see those coloured Hanbok in the streets.
211,4.0,"Tip #1: Download maps.me app as you will need this to walk around BukchonTip #2: Download Seoul subway and bus app so you can see which transportation can get you thereTip #3: I took taxi from Seoul City Hall for 10 000Won (A$11)Tip #4: The little streets have no semblance of logic. Road 1 is cut off and suddenly appears somewhere else. Maps.me could help but you just have to mosey around a bitTip #5: Great cafes and places to sit and watch the world go by hereIf you go to Hanbok-Nam, for A$20 you can rent a hanbok and walk to the palace and take some cheesy fotos. This is good fun. Or wear it and have some selfies taken in this quaint ballina which hides cafes, restaurants. Its is about 10 min walk to the palace. Go early so you don't get the smattering of tourists, say 11?"
212,3.0,"We walked through the village after having visited the palace - a 10-15 minute walk.The village was very interesting although we weren't fortunate enough to get into one of the houses.Lots of souvenir and finger food opportunity as you stroll the streets.Some great views at the top of the hill, the village houses with the city views in the background.Worth a visit."
213,5.0,"The best thing about it was the traditional Korean houses which the people actually lived in. Very instagram-able and photogenic place. The modern shops were nice to know, but not so much different with others in the city."
214,4.0,"Seoul is obviously a very metropolitan city, so it was nice to walk around an area with very traditional Korean houses for a little bit. We should have looked up beforehand because we ended up joining the ""trail"" halfway through. But you get the gist of it pretty quickly. The village is now dotted with cafes and artisan shops that are worth stopping by if you're in the market for some souvenirs. If you want a nice break with a view, go to the cafes at the top of the hill."
215,3.0,It was awkward wandering living neighbourhood which was clean and well kept. The building design are interesting to look at. There are none to go in and I spotted to drink stops on the outskirts.Worth a look if you have time but Seoul has so much more to offer.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful
216,3.0,"A nice enough place but nothing too impressive about this area.  You see some nice architecture and some nice houses a lot of which have been modernized but have been kept in the same Hanok style.  This is an original area.  Just remember before you go mooching around that these are peoples homes and some have very big dogs so beware!  About 20 min leisurely walk from the metro, shops and restaurants along the way.  If you want to hire traditional Hanbok dress for male and female there are plenty of shops around the area to help you walk around like you were back in the day.  You will see lots of people walking around in the traditional dress with the vibrant colours."
217,5.0,"It's amazing that this traditional Korean village even existed in the middle of the modern metropolitan city of Seoul. Start at the Bukchon tourist information centre, get hold of a walking map and follow the recommended walking paths, which will lead you through numerous residential alleys - uphill, downhill and through stone stairways. You will be feted with picturesque views all round, from prettily preserved traditional houses to scenic views of the surrounding hills and palace rooftops. Oh, since this is an actual residential area, be respectful to the residents living there."
218,4.0,"We enjoyed taking the walking tour through Bukchon.  The walk goes up into the hills a bit and can be steep in some places (kind of uncomfortable in hot weather!) but you will wander along some beautiful and photogenic streets and see gorgeous hanoks.  The lower level areas are more commercial with restaurants, coffee houses, ice cream places and nice shops."
219,4.0,"This area of traditional hanok houses - and new ones being built - is full of arty crafty workshops and tourists dressed in hanbok having their photos taken. It's a pleasure to wander round the lanes imagining a less frantic way of life, if you manage to go at a quieter time. You can get a map at the visitor centre showing where a lot of the workshops are. We visited a gold leaf workshop where a lovely man took great pleasure in explaining his work and showing examples to us with no expectation of selling anything. There are also quite a few residential buildings with notices outside telling you to be quiet - not much chance of that!"
220,3.0,"This is a neighborhood with traditional Korean houses, many of which have been converted to shops and museums when the residents were bothered by the tourists. Strict laws require that the traditional architecture be maintained. Due to the destruction of the Korean war, this area provides an uncommon view into the old style homes of Koreans, and is therefore worth the visit. In our case we included it in a private tour we arranged with Sweetrips, an excellent tour company which is the subject of another review."
221,4.0,This village makes for an easy duo with the large palace beside it. But please be quiet and courteous to the residents!
222,5.0,"Nice area for a walk. Hanging around the traditional style house and street is making it really nice.Enjoy the architecture style, the wall, the door. Every step is a bit different.Just get yourself lost in there and don't follow the crowd.There is as well an observatory which is just a 5th floor flat that gives a view over some roof top."
223,3.0,"It took a while for me to find this place, because it isn't easy to find. We ended up following a tour group to find it. We walked from the palace to this place, probably 15 minutes walk, but we got lost several times, so it actually took 1 hr. The surrounding area between the palace and this village is very hip, so lots of shopping and eating. The village itself is small, aside from photo-op, not really much to do."
224,4.0,We took the walk ourselves and in the evening. It was lovely to see the narrow streets and traditional houses with traditional roofs. There were many cultural experience places but were closed because we went in the evening. It's a walk up hill and at one spot we could see all the way to Namsan Tower.
225,5.0,"Beautiful neighborhood in the northern part of the city.Surrounded by beautiful mountains, it is peaceful and traditional, but you can still find shoppibg and nice cafe"
226,5.0,Take your time to admire the architecture and some home allow you to walk into it to see it. Wear comfortable shoes as it really take time to admire us sering the city skyline. There are foodies and souvenirs. Do not discard waste after eating & drinking it plus no loud voice so as not to disrupt the home owners. Enjoy it with patience.
227,5.0,This place is very good is you would like to see how the houses look like in the ancient times. It has the unique looks of the past and closet to Gyeongbokgung Palace. You may want to plan your itinerary to visit this two places together if you are keen on both attractions.
228,4.0,Please remember these homes are all occupied and it is a residential neighborhood. The homes are just spectacular and the area is wonderful. It's located in between the two palaces so I highly suggest you make a day out of it and visit all three sites. If you're up for some fun rent traditional Korean dress and go to the village and palaces. The outfits are beautiful and the rental places do your head to toe look. There are great local coffee places and we both enjoyed sipping on coffee while admiring the traditional architecture.
229,3.0,"We went there, but only because every SK guide book we owned told us too! It was beautiful and if you like the historic scene then give it a whirl; I personally found it boring and intrusive to the people that lived in the area. There's not a lot to see or do there; however good shopping, coffee shops etc in the lower levels and Parallel to the Hanoks! Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have made an effort to find it!!"
230,5.0,Walking thru the village took us into the past...quite a contrast with the modern buildings in the background.
231,4.0,Lovely place to explore. Old and traditional architecture and a few cool shops located there. Not a place for shopping but gives you an idea on how housing districts were like 50 years ago.
232,5.0,"This is a very pleasant neighborhood to visit, with lots of little shops, restaurants and tea houses. It gives you the opportunity to feel like you have left Seoul to enter a small village. Lots of tourists in the main streets, so you might want to go through the side streets. That is what we did and we were often alone."
233,4.0,"Not far from the Gyeongbokgung Palace you'll find this interesting neighborhood. I couldn't stop comparing it to the absolutely lovely ""Sannenzaka Ninenzaka"" in Kyoto. And that was probably a mistake....because Kyoto wins big-time.But on its own it is actually a nice part of town. Unlike Kyoto, where the area is filled with lots of shops, restaurants and tearooms, this area here is filled with actual houses where people live in.There are the occasional shops and a few tearooms, but for the most part is consists of residental buildings. And these are very pretty, authentic, traditional Korean houses....the Hanoks, hence the name of this area.At times it is quite a maze of narrow streets, some quite amazing, some a bit less interesting. If possible, pick up a road map from the tourist guides. They wander around this area.Some parts have really stunning views, check some of my pics for that. It is also nice to see people wander around in traditional clothes (Hanbok)....even though mostly rented (free access to all palaces if dressed like that). The combination of the Hanoks and the old-school dressed pedestrians give this area a lovely charm.Since people do live here, be a bit respectful. There are signs everywhere with a few ground rules. Even though many tourists completely ignore these, especially when it comes to the noise. Too bad.So, it's not as great as Sannenzaka Ninenzaka in Kyoto. But a lovely part of Seoul nonetheless. And in walking distance from the palace. Be sure to visit both.Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile."
234,4.0,"One of the places that is a must go if you are in Seoul. Coming from a place where there are no more villages, this is very interesting to see how the houses are uphill and stacked next to each other. Recommended"
235,4.0,"You can really have the feeling of old Korean here.  I love the atmosphere. But,  it will be great shall there are more information about the area.  No tourist information there."
236,4.0,"I just loved walking around this place, its a little slice of old world Korea stuck inside a concrete jungle, LOVED IT EVEN THOUGH IT RAINED ALL DAY - just a good excuse to stop and sit in a cafe for an hour"
237,5.0,Step back into time when you visit Bukchon hanok village. Very nice place to see easy to get to. It's about a 10 minute walk from the subway.
238,3.0,"We enjoyed seeing the old neighborhood, but not sure it was worth the walk up the hill to do it. Lots of posting about ""Private Residences"". Combination of residential and small shops."
239,5.0,It has much photogenic spot inside so i suggest you to take the mapAnd it has some store that sell clothes with cheap price..What a surprise
240,4.0,It's nice to see where locals live although there are so many tourists that many locals are moving out. There are lots of signs asking people to speak quietly. Walls are thin in Korea. The old architecture is a great photo op.
241,5.0,The stroll their is definitely a great one. You ahloud definitely go in the high streets that are in the north part for more original buildings.
242,5.0,This Village was nearly wiped off the map during the occupation period in Korea's history but the residents set about rebuilding the Village in the same manner as was previously on the site and they did a great job a unique wander around 'a historic village' albeit reconstructed some 50 years ago. A great job done
243,5.0,"Next to the Gyeongbokgung palace, this village has great cafes, restaurants, art galleries and shopping. As a tourist destination it is promoted as streets of older style Korean houses, so all the delightful shops and art work was a bonus. Loved the Interesting murals on the walls of the village. I would enjoy going back there again for a longer time."
244,4.0,It's worth seeing the Hanok village but (honestly) it's a pleasant hours walk nothing more - you'd struggle spending a whole day there...
245,4.0,"It was great to see the five different houses in one place. English interpretation is proved, both on the signs and in the pamphlet. You can view all the rooms and there contents, unobstructed , but not access then."
246,5.0,We went there and walk around the village. There have many couple weared the traditional korean dress and took a photos and The best thing is Bulmakgol hahaha that is a delicious big cow ribs I ever had.
247,3.0,Did not really sure what to do here. Too crowded to take a decent pic. Lots of cafe and art gallery. A maze of old buildings.
248,4.0,"This is a great activity to pass a couple of hours in Seoul. It's a beautiful little walk, and interesting to see the replica houses on the grounds. An excellent choice for families with younger kids!"
249,4.0,Beautiful gardens and a lovely place to spend an hour or two just strolling through the gardens and the traditional buildings.
250,3.0,"Nice area on a hill, and very touristy, with small shops, some restaurants.  Surprisingly many new buildings inbetween old ones (or old looking ones)."
251,5.0,Old town Seoul.  Lots of shops and restaurants.  Many pedestrian walking streets.  This is where the palaces are.  Good way to get a sense of Seouls history and pleasant area to spend half or a full day.  Make sure to visit one of the palaces.
252,4.0,Decided to visit this part of Seoul as it appeared in some Korean drama before . These traditional Korean houses are actually with residents inside so the tourists have to keep their voices down as not to disturb them . Great for photo shooting especially with Hanbok ( Korean traditional attire)which you can rent from a few shops around. Can see some couples have their wedding photos taken here. Leisure strolls along the narrow alleys while admiring this historical architectures is fun & relaxing.Worth a visit if you want to learn about the ancient culture of Korea!
253,5.0,"You get to see how the traditional/ older houses were and you can enter some. It would be interesting to live here. These houses are actually lived in, so be conscious of where you step and keeping the noise levels down."
254,4.0,I do feel sorry for the residents in the area. The crowd were just ignorant to the fact that they are really noisy even though there are signs everywhere asking them to keep the noise down.I still think it is still worth visiting the village. The hanoks are pretty and the area is safe and pleasant place for easy stroll. Try to avoid the crowd and come early in the morning.
255,4.0,"A nice area to walk for a couple of hours. Lots of places to have coffee, tea and food. Interesting little stores scattered among winding narrow streets. Lots of other tourist but lots of locals too!"
256,5.0,Must visit! And take lots and lots of pictures.Every spots are picture spots. Don't ever miss coming here.Period.
257,5.0,"Loved the vibe of this place. Great picture opportunity and a few places to rent Hanbok. This area has lots of small cafes with nice earthy feel to them. We spent about two hours clicking some memorable pics in this beautiful part of the city. Please keep about 20 USD for renting a hanbok , locker and other accessories. Do visit early as it can get crowded with visitors who are here mostly for pictures in the traditional outfits."
258,5.0,This is a beautiful and interesting part of Seoul with the old-style architecture faithfully preserved and renovated. Many great photo opportunities as you walk around. There are a number of nice shops in restaurants as well. Arrive early to avoid the hordes of tourists in period costume.
259,5.0,"Strolling along the quaint old houses of Bukchon village was relaxing. It is a residential area so one needs to take note not to be too rowdy. The residents seem to be used to living in a tourist attraction and a few of them even sold drinks like barley tea.There is also a row of cafes along a main road beside the village. I had a green tea latte at Osulloc and I'm still missing it. The cafes are beautifully renovated and nice to walk along them. If you are in a group, you could also try cafe hopping."
260,5.0,"Hign on a hill, many steps to climb but well worth the visit. From the highest point you can see the roofs of these homes and also their open courtyards in the middle of most homes, a unique architectural point. One word of advice: please enjoy it in silence or talk softly since it is the residence of many people. Please do not litter.  The residents are nice enough to allow us to traverse in front of their homes to take a peak into their historical culture so please do be respectful."
261,4.0,"The first time we set foot at Bukcheon Hanok Village, we fl in love with the old traditional houses with a modern twist. Fast forward today, we went back to the same place to have our wedding photos taken. Highly recommend anyone to visit this place of interest and to take time for a slow stroll to absorb the beauty in it."
262,5.0,Beautiful old houses here really nice to walk around almost car free. Lots of people wear traditional dress while hoing around
263,3.0,Historic Japanese homes from the early 1900s preserved and restored to look as they did originally.  People still live here so there are signs all over asking for quiet as loads of people wander the narrow streets and paths up and down.  Interesting to see but not a whole lot you can really do here..
264,5.0,Loved walking through this historical area.  Many young people were walking around in Native Korean attire who were glad to be photographed with us.
265,5.0,"Bukchon Hanok Village was #1 on my list of things I was excited to see in South Korea. We stayed at a wonderful Hanok Guesthouse (check out Raon Guesthouse) and were able to explore the area with our host as a guide. Honestly wish we had spent the majority of our time in this area of South Korea, and less time in the more city areas in the city-proper. Take your time exploring the quaint shops and restaurants here and being part of the village's authentic lifestyle."
266,1.0,Unless you're into olden days architecture there is nothing much for you to do or see here. It is like walking around outside of people's houses and taking pictures as if we (or they) are aliens. I don't understand the hype about wandering in a housing area.
267,4.0,"Nice area to walk. Old Korean houses, smaller streets, souvenir shops. Nice place to escape from cosmopolitan Seoul."
268,5.0,"Similar to the better known Insa-dong, Bukchon consists of many small winding alleys with the typical Korean buidlings. Although it is very crowded it is great walking through the streets and enjoying the atmosphere"
269,5.0,"If it's your first time visiting Seoul, this village is the perfect area to go right after Gyeongbokgung Palace. It's just right next to the palace, you just need to walk a bit.In the village there are a couple of guides walking around in uniforms. You can ask them where to start, where to walk, they'll guide you happily and give you a map. There are a few cute cafes to hangout, they look cozy. We did a good one round of the village in around 45 minutes included stopping for ice cream."
270,4.0,It was ok but not really great. If you have extra time or have exited angkuk station; why not. The walk from the Angkuk station was quite long so you're legs will be a little sore when you actually get there. The alleys were ok but not thay great for me because they didn't look that old and there were signs of modern living like plumbing and electricity
271,3.0,"I visited the area with the free walking tour provided. Our guide, Miss Kim, was a funny and charming old lady. Unfortunately the area was crowded with tourists. So it was impossible to get a good picture. Moreover they were very noisy so there was no serenity there. I felt pity to the residents who live there. I enjoyed the visit to Dr. Baek In Je's beautiful historical house, which is located in the area. It was less touristy too."
272,5.0,"Sandwiched between the 2 main palace complexes in Seoul, this village is quintessential example of a traditional Korean village. It has numerous streets (uphill/downhill sometimes) and they run through traditional houses and quaint estates. It has great photo opportunity and best time is to visit during dusk. Please keep in mind that is primarily a residential area.Must visit in Seoul!!!!"
273,4.0,Felt like it was in the past walking through the traditional houses.  There is also one house which was open to view for free.
274,5.0,"A little flashback to how Seoul used to be before the sky scraper jungle.Nice houses there and nice walk. Shame that some tourists were very loud although many signs ""please be quite"" are scatterd in the area. After all it's still a residential area."
275,3.0,came here as it is recommended by a few friends but i dont think its worth visiting unless you really interested to snap a few photo like me..
276,5.0,"If you want a cultural experience into the olden days of Korea, definitely check out the Bukchon village area out! There are a lot of cute side streets to go into, as well as areas where you can attend and take part in workshops. We went to an area where we were able to learn a lot about the actual etching on Korean traditional clothing and it was awesome to just get a better understanding of everything. Really cute homes designed with how it was back in the older days in Korea!"
277,3.0,nothing much to see here except hiking up this small residential arealots of tourists sometimesthere are also info guides in the area
278,5.0,These are residential streets made up of the original types of houses. It's on a hillside so there are also a number of good viewpoints of the city and you get old/new contrasts. Some of the streets are steep.
279,4.0,"Bukchon Hanok Village is home to many traditional houses, called hanok, that date back to the Joseon Dynasty. The name Bukchon translates to ""northern village"" Today many of these hanoks operate as cultural centers, guesthouses, restaurants and tea houses, etc. that give you an opportunity to immerse yourself into the traditional Korean culture. It's lovely to wander around here and take lots of photos. The doors and entrances are very photogenic.Let a cab take you up here and then walk mostly downhill."
280,4.0,"Bukchon Hanok village - the place with the remained of traditional Hanok houses in the alleyway, where there are different upward & downward landscape scenery to see. Also, around Samcheong area, not to miss the art galleries & museums. Nearby is Gyeongbokgung."
281,4.0,"Here there are some beautiful traditional houses, with many people walk around in the traditional clothes. Be aware it can get a little crowded!"
282,5.0,"This is a great culturally-preserved area. It's nice to walk around and explore the different houses built and preserved. Gives you a feel what the ""Old"" Korea looked like in the days of past."
283,5.0,"This is a walking trip. You just wander around the streets of Bukchon appreciating the traditional korean style architecture of the houses here. People actually live in these houses so there are a whole lot of signs asking you to keep quiet, which ruins the look in my opinion but I can see how the locals might get annoyed with all the tourists walking around everyday here. It's a great photo spot to say you are in korea. There are lots of side streets and we took random turns and headed towards samcheondong to eat lunch."
284,5.0,Very ancient mixed with modern ambiance which is very fascinating as you walk along the streets and corridor the village. Perfect to reminisce what does korea looks like way back those old times. Very impressive how they keep this attraction in a clean and modernized environment.
285,3.0,"The old houses all seem to have ugly store fronts. There are a couple of old residences, but there are more houses with new construction using the old style - lovely wood but new."
286,3.0,"In its heyday, I'm sure Bukchon Hanok (Village) must be quaint and nice.  Since it's becoming one of the main attractions of Seoul, and that tour companies have made this into one of their compulsory stops, you can imagine the hordes of tourists that are been thrown into the neighbourhood.  Roads here are built hotch potch and they zig zag all over the place.  I'm sure that occupants of houses along the main route would be annoyed with lots and lots of people overstepping their boundaries and taking selfie pictures of themselves in front of houses with any kinds of architectural merits.  Most of the signs that I witnessed are more or less around the same theme:  keep it quiet, don't step on our stairs, keep away.  What does that tell you - not welcoming indeed.  There are also user friendly signs all along the path to ensure that you are not swayed from your original path.  In other words, some occupants are affected more than others.  The vista of Seoul has changed over the years and so does Bukchon.  Trendy boutique shops such as Gentle Monster (glass frame that's opted by K-Pop stars) and other designer shops have also set up their stores here.  Therefore, historical village feel is gradually been interspersed with clean line edgy shops that you get to see at Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills.  Whatever it is, this is Bukchon now, and no longer the endearing Hanok.  It's worth your while to visit but don't keep your hope high.  Come out from Gate 3 of Angguk Metro Station."
287,3.0,"Bukchon village is sold to tourist as the typical Korean Style Housing area. However, it is actually not really a old korean bulding style."
288,4.0,"Traditional houses in the center of capital city. Need to be a little bit fit to climb the road, but worth it."
289,3.0,"still largely a residential neighborhood, not particularly interesting to walk around on your own.  not very large, perhaps 15 minutes was all I needed see most.  but could always add samcheongdong which is close enough."
290,3.0,"The expectation of Bukchon was that it was literally a village that has remained in traditional Korean lifestyle despite its proximity to the city. Realistically though it is old buildings and a bunch of touristy sideshows. Expected to be here for a long time, stayed for probably ten minutes. Venture out of Seoul if you're looking for traditional. Bukchon Observatory is worth a look if you decide to visit (and if you can find it)!"
291,4.0,"Walking the narrow winding streets flowing up and down the hills is like being in a time machine. It's not a museum, people do still like in there. You can visit some of the homes or check out local shops and restaurants. Great vistas from the streets in both daylight and night time. While in Seoul, If you can visit the Bukchon area!"
292,3.0,"Unlike some entire cities that you visit (think Rome or maybe Krakow) that are filled from pavement to the sky with historical sights, you'll get at best a few streets to visit. So not really immersive nor impressive. And because there's not much to see, you'll be sharing it with hundreds of selfies sticks, like medieval standards, waving through the air. It's primarily a residential with a few shops and you'll see some nice house frontage and cobbled roofs - a couple of streets are nice photo ops."
293,5.0,"I love the architecture, and what's more fascinating is that there are people still living there! There are a couple houses that are set up for tourists and you can pay to go in for some special activities. I also saw a house that is available for homestay."
