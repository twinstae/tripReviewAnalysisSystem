0,3.0,"Nothing special about this particular market, probably a bit more exciting at night but none of the stores are particularly unique or interesting. I am sure you can find more lively markets out there."
1,3.0,We came here thinking it would be more like the Myeongdong shopping area. It‚Äôs not terrible but just wasn‚Äôt what we expected. It is a great place to buy souvenirs for cheap.
2,5.0,"Cruising to the evening in the night market if Namdaemun Market, where they are lots of cheap soveniors yo buy. There are many souvenirs from winter clothings, socks, magnets, light snacks and even cafes around the corners of this night market. There are many locals handmade crafts and design made in here by the korean itself. Lovely stroll in the evening. ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è"
3,4.0,1. 40 minute wait in mid- afternoon for savory vegetable hotteok located just across from Courtyard by Marriot NDM was worth it! Greasy but oh so tasty. Likened to Chinese Scallion pancake. Nice. 2. Shop for prescription glasses or sunnies in the many spectacle shops at the market. Prices and styles are very competitive. We settled on Polaris Spectacles shop where we found the English- speaking Mr Kim to be very patient and attentive. A pair of Varilux progressive lens which would have cost me SGD 350 back home cost just half the price here. And it took just 4 working days to get them ready for me.
4,5.0,A must visit for the food. My partner tells me the shopping was overrated and expensive. May aswell ship in the stores for better quality.
5,4.0,"Food, clothing, knock offs and everything else you could think of.  Fun to walk around and even with a lot of people, you'll feel safe."
6,4.0,"üéã‚ô®Ô∏è‚úàÔ∏èNamdaemun MarketNamdaemun Market is in the vicinity of Myeongdong Market. A conventional shopping hub where one could buy from an assortment of goods ranging from food, sports wear, bags, clothing, textiles,ginseng, accessories, cosmetics, kitchenware.Who knows one could strike a bargain or get a great discount. A must visit."
7,3.0,"The market is big and bustling. It is more about lower quality, cheaper and fake goods. We thought it might have had more hand crafted things but it didn't."
8,2.0,"Big market selling lots of souvenirs and cheap wares. Plenty of food stalls to try, but avoid the alley restaurants displaying their wax dishes and calling you in - we tried one and the dishes that arrived looked nothing like what was advertised, tasteless and we got only half the dumplings displayed for the same price - was then told the front displays were ‚Äúsamples‚Äù only. Then they pretended they didn‚Äôt know what to do with a credit card - asking for cash - when there‚Äôs their machine right there and finally put it through on the card to give us a proper receipt. Really dodgy."
9,3.0,"It's a market . . . many stores sell the same merchandise all at the same prices . . . lots of junk, very little treasures . . . food stalls which are mostly less than appetizing (and some with very questionnable hygenic practices) . . . and less appealing on a hot,humid, odiferous day than on a cooler, less smelly day. So, you either love it or you hate it -- it's an individual preference."
10,4.0,This is a huge market selling different items. There are some maps saying which street sells what but we just took a wonder around. We saw a lot of shops selling shoes or hats or phone accessories. There was also a home-wear section. Some shops selling Korean souvenirs. We visited a second time as I really wanted to try a corn dog and there was a whole row of venders I think it was near gate 4 (if from here you walk down into the centre of the market). We also got some Korean sweets and found a postcard!
11,1.0,"Went during lunch hour under the hot mid day sun. The market in general is covered but the stores are quite cramped and it gets pretty heated. Was looking for the counter seats eating area like in Gwangjang Market, but walked a few rounds and still cannot find it. Ended up in some mediocre Korea ‚Äúrestaurant‚Äù that sells a range of Korea food. So they say jack of all trade master of none, the food was not fantastic and they expect one main dish per pax. If you are there, please walk into a small alley which u see ppl queueing for grilled fish and steam egg. May be a better choice for authentic Korea food."
12,3.0,I love Namdaemun more than Myeongdong because the goods and the foods here are cheaper. But the market is a traditional one so it's a little bit dirty and crowded.
13,4.0,Typical Asian market. Very nice to visit and get an impression of how people live eat and dress. Every time we are in Seoul we visit this place.
14,4.0,"This market is worth a visit. Many curious things are traded here. For example there is s shop that sells gift packaging materials, so if you are looking for a special wrapping for a gift this is the place."
15,4.0,"Remember this is not the Galleria Mall here...we are talking huge quantities of cheap mass produced items. They have. clothing, furs , suitcases, food (massive food market starts at 4:00). Look for the candy vendor that makes candy from cornstarch.  They insert a filling that tastes like a snickers!  No kidding. Easy to take home and they last for weeks. Good for GF folks"
16,1.0,"Went there for street food but it is almost inexistant and scattered all around the huge market.If you are after something similar to markets in Thailand, this is not the place"
17,3.0,Saw a myriad of stalls and large numbers of shoppers but was disappointed by what seemed to be quite average items being sold
18,5.0,I visited Namdaemun. I could feel the traditional market of Seoul. The grilled fish restaurant inside Namdaemun was delicious. I recommend it. It was nice to walk to Myeongdong after eating at Namdaemun restaurant.
19,3.0,Food and clothing stalls in the middle of the road and stores along the street. Place for cheap clothes and local food.
20,4.0,"Namdaemun Market is a must when visiting Seoul.  Nighttime visit is a lot better than during the day.  My wife always finds several things to buy every time we visit.  Remember where the restrooms are, sometimes they are hard to find.  Tourist information teams can be found throughout the market.  They will be dressed in all red.  They have free maps of Seoul and the market in English.  No need to dress up for the visit.My favorite are steamed pigs feet.  The vendor will a small bag containing onions, sometimes garlic and one or two other items that compliment the feet.  I always get a couple to take back to the hotel room.Recommend wearing of tennis shoes because you will definitely be doing some walking."
21,4.0,"Do go to the information booth to get a map of the place first so that you can plan which section to explore.Good for buying cheap clothes, currency exchange with attractive rates.We came here to buy children's clothing."
22,3.0,"We came here on a Friday night and it wasn‚Äôt anywhere near as hustling and bustling as we expected. It was around 8pm and most stalls were winding down. A few tourists were around, but we didn‚Äôt get the buzz a lot of the other reviews mention. We found a quiet restaurant for dinner and then left. During the day I can see this being an incredible atmosphere!"
23,5.0,I'm not sure if anyone knows how many stalls there are in Namdaemun Market! The street food stalls are interesting and it's worth trying a few to get into the spirit of things. They have a fried pancake which is then stuffed with either meat or vegetables that is absolutely delicious. The steamed dumplings with either pork or kimchi stuffing are also very good!
24,4.0,Prices don't get any lower in Nandaemun market.  Traditionally they cater for wholesale but some do entertain tourist buyers.  Be prepared to use sign language as many don't speak English and jostle a bit as the alley can be quite narrow and cramp.
25,3.0,"Shoes, apparel, souvenirs, kitchen utensils, kids clothing, handicrafts, bags, street food - you can get all of these in this huge market. There are shops in the building right next to the market as well. We went in early afternoon so the crowd is not too bad."
26,4.0,It is a good experience here to shop at the open air market for a variety of items such as food and clothings. There are also plenty of wholesale shops here but they cater only to businesses and does not sell to individuals. You will need time to go into the alleys to explore the variety of shops that sells household items and many other types of things. Namdaemun market is said to be the largest in Korea.
27,5.0,"This open air market was across the street from our hotel and is mostly hidden through many lane ways , it‚Äôs amazing that from street side you wouldn‚Äôt know how much market is there until you start walking through it. Lots of good vendors but this market mostly clothes. It‚Äôs a must on your list. On a side note the currency exchange in this market have the best exchange rates all very good and clean."
28,4.0,"Of the two markets I went to, Namdaemun and Gwangjang, I prefer Gwangjang. Namdaemun doesn‚Äôt have near as many food stands as Gwangjang. For me, most of what was for sale at Namdaemun is junk. I didn‚Äôt buy anything. Still, Namdaemun is worth the time. Wouldn‚Äôt go again, but would recommend to friends."
29,5.0,Weekday night is not too crowded and going here before getting dark is also a good idea to avoid the crowd.Try the local street foods of Namdaemun.
30,5.0,Woke up in the early hours looking for some noodle in the area. Came across a small food area in Namdaemun Market that offers hand cut noodles. So yumm! Approx. 5000 won.
31,2.0,This was supposed to be an old established night market of Seoul. However we found it quite deserted with few stalls. Our disappointment was saved some what by nice pork knuckle sold by a small Chinese restaurant located within the market.
32,4.0,A perfect place to buy souvenirs with bargain-able price. So many items to look at. Huge area and requires lots of walking. Must try to famous food stalls.
33,5.0,This is the opposite for the fancy and expensive shopping streets. Lots of little stalls selling all sorts of stuff in cheap prices. Couple of interesting food vendors as well. Nice to look around :)
34,4.0,We went there a few times.it is very big and sells everything from food to fashion you can eat good cheap korean food there aswell as good street food can get very busy in the evening.you have to go if in seoul
35,4.0,We happened across this market while searching for a restaurant. It was a fascinating place to wander.
36,2.0,"I read about good review of Namdaemun Market. But for me, as a shopper for good value stuff, this place is not great. Yes, plenty of shops and many many choices. But it's mainly for reseller. I stopped by one of the store and wanted to find out the price.  The sales lady asked me if I'm a seller. I gave up and walked away."
37,5.0,"There is nothing you can not find in the market. It extends for blocks on end. Street vendor food is great, especially the hoteok and there is lots to buy and bargaining is part of the fun."
38,4.0,"We enjoyed the assorted food stalls - interest and different Korean fare. The shops offer a variety of clothing, luggage and other items, some, like tools, for locals."
39,5.0,"Everything you could possibly need is available in this incredible market.  From army clothing to jewellery, fish to bedding.  Get a map from one of the friendly guides and just follow your nose and experience the authentic Korean market. Granted there‚Äôs a lot of tat on the stalls but there is in any market.  I would recommend seeing the fish part of the market, and the food stalls.  At the end of our walkabout, we saw this food cart with a queue.  As everyone in the queue was Korean, we thought it must be good so lined up not knowing what exactly they were queuing for.  15 minutes later we bought two deep fired veggie pancakes for 2,000 KRW - about ¬£1.40.  We walked up to Sungnyemun Gate and tucked into them.  They were absolutely fabulous."
40,4.0,"Very central and walking distance from the metro. There are hundreds of shops and stalls.  The usual are available, shoes, clothes ,souvenirs etc, etc. There are dozens of food stalls. Worth the visit for budget shopping."
41,3.0,"Came here two days ago around 3 in the afternoon.  Pretty big and busy.  It‚Äôs very similar to a flee market.  Lots of cheap looking clothes, some K-pop merchandises and street food.  All the sellers were older people.  Seems like if you stop to look, they expect you to buy.  My sister got yelled at by one of them because she was looking at some food and was still deciding if she wanted it or not.  Ended up not buying anything there.  Still a good place to explore but prefer Myeongdong instead."
42,3.0,"This market was just opposite our hotel so we wandered over there on our first day, but have to say it was very underwhelming. Many of the goods looked to be straight out of China, not particularly good quality, the sort of things you can see in markets anywhere. There were plenty of street food stalls but nothing that really appealed. Most of the shops were packing up from 7pm and nothing much was open after 8pm, so visit during the day, or just head to Myeongdong instead."
43,4.0,We visited this market on our last day; my husband got a good quality souvenir t-shirt for just $4. There‚Äôs a lot of junk but it‚Äôs fun to look around and plenty of places to eat or grab a coffee.  The information center near Gate 5? turned out to be two people standing around handing out maps which were very useful.  There‚Äôs a good stationery store on the aptly named Stationery Street and a ton of camera stores all on one street.
44,5.0,I did buy some fruit and fried snacks from the stands. They were pretty tasty. I was able to buy several hats and scarves. I did find some good deals. The sellers were willing to bargain on some of the items. The prices are were okay overall. I did find purses cheaper at other markets.
45,4.0,"Looks like this is the best market in Seoul as it‚Äôs been going for a very long time. Street food here is great, lots of options and the donuts were unreal. The clothing is pretty terrible and there is a lot of supreme stuff that is clearly fake. Worth a visit tho for the atmosphere."
46,4.0,"This is the place.  We buy golf wear and other clothes (women's, men, children).  Great selection at great negotiable prices!  Everything from pants, shorts, jackets, suits, sport coats.  Careful, you'll probably get asked about brand knock offs too so just ignore them."
47,4.0,"So much to see, buy, eat,. These markets are huge with something differnt to see around the clock. Food cooked fresh and served quickly by friendly staff. Lots of food choices whether it is something quick and easy by a street vendor or a sit down meal in one of the food alleyways."
48,4.0,If you a looking for lots of choices for inexpensive items this is a good place to good.  Good place for souvenirs.  Also found a currency exchange booth with very good rates.
49,3.0,"It is a place I think everyone should visit, but this thing is over hyped big time. Yes there are lots of vendors, most of them selling the same ‚Äústuff.‚Äù I went because I wanted to try some street food, but I didn‚Äôt.. I understand Kimchi is the most famous dish in S Korean, but the smell of it makes me sick, which is weird because I love cabbage. Needless to say with the lack of shopping for anything worth buying and the constant smell of Kimchi, we didn‚Äôt make it long."
50,5.0,This is a great place to try the street food of Seoul. I also enjoyed walking around and viewing all the shops and the folks buying and selling.
51,5.0,Definitely worth a visit! One of the great market's we have seen.  Try not to get lost as you stroll endless stalls.  Something for everyone here.
52,5.0,"Compared to dongdaemun, namdaemun market feels much more local and authentic. I went in the late morning and both locals and tourists were bustling around doing their daily chores or shopping for souvenirs respectively. Check out the small alleys (stew alley, hairtail fish alley) for a claustrophobic but fun look at ajummas serving up their best food. Burdeng mall and Mama were great malls for childrens' clothes and accessories (way better than dongdaemun) but the streetside kiosks and stalls offer better prices (2000krw for 1 piece of clothing!!), that is if you manage to find pieces you like in the jumble of clothes."
53,3.0,"If you have time for only one place - Namdaemun or Myeongdong - I would highly recommend the latter. Because Myeongdong is still very much bustling with activities past 8pm, whereas Namdaemun is a dead town by 8pm.I would only presume that because Namdaemun is closer to the downtown area, therefore it might be more convenient to the people working in that area. As for tourists - head down to Myeongdong. You won't regret it."
54,2.0,This area is older and smaller. Many small stores filled with stuff. The inside of the buildings are even worse. People have crammed their wares into a small area and sit like a flea market for you to come by. It‚Äôs neat to see but nothing seemed light to buy. At one point I used the bathroom which was a hole in the ground. Cool to walk through but lower quality options.
55,4.0,Namdaemun is pretty extensive so we didn't visit every nook and cranny though we did manage to get quite a few of the souvenirs and gifts we brought back from there. There is also a good street food scene and we had really nice tteokbokki from there and sampled some fish cakes. There was an interesting stall owner who would play the clarinet between sales which was cute. We also chanced upon this fairly hidden food alley which might have been kalguksu (noodle) alley. A good place to visit if you like to shop and eat! Also not too far from Myeongdong so easy to wander over if that's your base.
56,2.0,"Went to visit Namdaemun Market late night. Got 5 small dishes and 2 sodas with my wife. The bill came out to ‚Ç©111,000 or $109.00. Are you kidding me? That price is more than our food bills for 3 days combined. A ver bad experience indeed."
57,4.0,"There are many alleys filled with shops selling a variety of things ranging from food to tshirts to fashion accessories. Quite a number of buildings with wholesale accessories (earrings, necklaces etc) shops. The Alpha stationery building was a letdown. At a small alley selling bibimbup and noodles, we ordered 2 dishes and got a number of other dishes for free! Truly authentic Korean food!"
58,5.0,Doesn‚Äôt matter how old you are but you will have a good time here day or night!!! And I think they keep most An Korea old style trade and have a lot new thing too !! They sell everything here and lot a good food too I mean all kind of food west or east what ever!!! We love come here to eat and walk around
59,5.0,"Visited twice one time on a Sunday. Shops were closed but streets were lined with hawkers and clothes sellers. Prices were very good too.During another weekday visit, the place came to live with shops all open and streets were still filled with foodstalls and clothes sellers. Plenty to see and do and buy as well.Shopping here is good and with more competitive prices than Bangkok for clothes as well. Tourists Guides are positioned on the streets to help tourists with questions and information. Nice place to visit near Myeongdong."
60,5.0,Look for the alley with fish stew... There are many shops there and they serve simple food. Did not disappoint even when I‚Äôve tried a few different shops. Prices are not that expensive too - 6-8k per pax could give you a wonderful meal.
61,4.0,"Big, big and more big. A lot af market stall.Walk, see and buy. IT takes you  a lot of time to walk around the whole marker, but no problem, you can visit this market every day and iT is naar the centrum and the grand station"
62,2.0,"Namdaemun Market is busy and filled to the brim with great street food, cheap souvenirs, and a general variety of goods. If this is what you're looking for, then it's definitely worth a visit. There are so many vendors that you could probably spend the good part of a day if you wanted to visit them all. However we spent less than an hour because it just wasn't for us; the crowds were extreme and most of them tourists, and stall owners would be calling us from every side trying to sell this and that - most of it things you would find hard to explain a real need for.I do have to praise the food. It is cheap, and most of it is fresh and made before you. It's also eaten by locals which is always a good sign. I just didn't see much value in the shops' stock and didn't enjoy the busy tourist crowds. There are other markets I would rather frequent."
63,5.0,"Loved the assortment of shops here! From the street stalls to the stores inside multistorey building, every shopper should be able to find something to take home! Besides clothing and cosmetics, there are entire levels selling ladies' accessories, clothing, cooking ware, home decor, artificial flowers, etc. If you are a keen shopper, you will need to plan easily 2-4 hours here. There is also at least 2 side streets selling local Korean dishes."
64,4.0,"Our guide said this was the best  market in Seouk for shopping.    Many vendors have their own factories to produce goods for sale at better quality and prices than elsewhere.   Certain types of goods are concentrated on named streets.    Lots and lots of shops and places to eat - some just stalls, others are full service sit down.    We spent almost 2 hours strolling and eating in the neighborhood."
65,5.0,"When you love bargain items, this is a must visit market. You can find korean made clothes, accessories, kitchen utensils and many more. Many coffee stalls too. Easy to access."
66,1.0,This market is full of counterfeited goods and just junk in general. Myeongdong and Insadong are both much better.
67,4.0,"Great place for shopping! There are many shops selling fashion accessories and many eateries. Very much accessible by metro and public bus. As the roads there are much congested, getting a taxi can be quite challenging. Very much a crowded place with locals and tourists so be very careful when there. Take good care of your belongings."
68,1.0,"Namdaemun Market is very large and repetitive. It is a dense maze of uninteresting clothing and trinkets. The street food in Korea in general is not very interesting considering how accessible and varied the restaurants are; mostly variations on fried things all breaded in the same batter. In terms of absolute number of food stalls in the entire Namdaemun area, it might be a large-ish number but they are sparsely scattered between an astronomical number of all-the-same clothing/textile/trinket stalls, all of which just look kind of depressing."
69,3.0,Our guide allowed 45 minutes to stay in the market which was not enough However we bought nice local products and souvenirs with good prices
70,4.0,"We spent a couple of hours here, having great fun just wondering up and down the aisles of stores.  So much to see, so many wonderful smells.  Plenty to eat and plenty of cheap market goods to buy."
71,5.0,"Unlike any place we have ever been, the food was amazing and so many shops and stands to go through.  You could spend days and not see everything.  My wife flew here to visit and was highly impressed by the culture and how nice everyone was.  We loved Seoul and taking a taxi from our hotel to the market was a breeze.  I highly recommend that if you visit Seoul, you hit up this market.  We went early (0900) on a Saturday, and it was good we did because when we left at 3pm it was packed!!!"
72,4.0,Not so upmarket but there are nice earrings and souvenirs to buy.. need to find your way around as the roads look similar
73,2.0,"My point of view that is a market for locals not really for tourists, you can explore shops selling clothing, hardware, home necessity, sewing, cheap and average price. Overall, market is too big but not a tourist attraction."
74,5.0,i went to take a photo at namdaemun.most important is to buy a pair of gloves.there are few streets dedicated to sales of different commodity..eg shoe street souvenir street and food street..the prices of souvenirs are the cheapest here.but still must scout around as different stall offer different price.the famous almond nuts i bought at 5000won.the other places are selling at 5500won or 6000 won.many choices of souvenirs eg keychains pens pouches..great to buy all you need from here.will come here again for sure.
75,3.0,"If you're game for street food, this is your place.  I'd arrived with a tummy upset and after day 1 in the hotel, I wasn't being too adventurous.  There was lots of clothing, shoes and junky souvineers that didn't take my fancy.  The other half enjoyed the street food.  We were out and about early and it was Monday, I suspect a quiet day for the market as it didn't seem that busy.  I was a bit disappointed really, I'd been expecting better quality stuff."
76,5.0,"They have tourist lounge gate two next to ginseng shop. They give free snacks and coffee. Food is cheap if you eat in small alley place, 8t for grill fish 4 fish rice n steam egg. A lot of places selling ginseng don‚Äôt know if real or fake. Almonds and seaweed sold everywhere."
77,5.0,"There‚Äôs everything you could possibly want to take him in this market from your typical souvenirs to delish food and prepared food. It tends to get busy after lunch, but this when the best food vendors come out :)"
78,4.0,"This is basically a pedestrian shopping mall.  Spread out over a couple blocks, it first opened in 1964.  It was interesting to see some of the different food places with donuts, fruits, etc.  We saw lots of shoes, and some squiggly root looking things in water jars.  There were also lots of shoe stores.  It is probably a good place for souvenirs along with Insa-dong street. We did meet people here who spoke English to help us."
79,5.0,"I've been there with my gf, around a month ago. We've eaten various street food and seen lots lots of shooping area. I think it will be a super great experience, if it is your first visit in Korea :)"
80,4.0,This market is the largest market ) we were walking üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è for 1.5 hours. Looked around. Here we can eat traditional Korean food sitting inside a small ‚Äúcafe‚Äù with heaters look like a fan üòÇ. Price for everything is cheaper than outside of market. This market has a lot of buildings with clothes and other things. Inside a hot airüò¨üß£üå®
81,1.0,"I thought that markets stuff would be a lot cheaper .. But NO! The ppl tries to grab ur arm tightly so u couldnt escape or walk pass their items, most of the bags there are expensive they tried to sell me a small makeup bag ( a simple one ) for 32 000 won like seriously ?? I had to give them an uncomfortable look and just pull my arms from them, i was so nervous to even look closely to the items sold there cos they can be grab u by the arms and its hard to let loose. ( NOT COOL) The items sold there isnt any unique either, cos u can find similar items at myeondong underground shopping, or the street. You dont have to come to namdaemun market trust me its expensive! Unless u are there just to eat or take photos However u can find  a store that sells international groceries around the market. If u are looking for Halal food."
82,3.0,"Had been to S.korea many times, Namdaemun stall owners from China rather rude..She supposed to pass the foods pack to me instead she just throw at the table, however some.of the stall are pretty kind and introduce some street foods to us. But expensive but just try it if you are looking for their local foods.."
83,5.0,Best place to get fresh and reasonable priced strawberries. Saw some tourists bought boxes of it to be brought home. Definitely cheaper than department stores and myeongdong market
84,4.0,"If you want to see the real korea visit namdaemun or the gwangjang markets. bustling with culture a real hotspot for not just tourists but locals alike, authentic Korean street food and a variety of market stalls. Great food, great atmosphere!"
85,4.0,"Namdaemun Market is more of a traditional style shopping area. It open early morning and close late night. The retail streets are divided into several categories like Children's Clothes Street, Watch/Jewelry Street, Fashion Street, Military Uniform Street, Bedding Street, Mountain Climbing Equipment Street, Camera Street, Stationery/Toy Street, Food Material Street. Food streets include Chopped Noodles Street and Fish/Stew Street. it a must place to visit if you in korea.ps: ( there visitors information booth if you need any assistance )"
86,4.0,We enjoyed this market a few times.  They don‚Äôt hassle you. Street food entertaining and good. Tourist help there as well. We were told when we went to Korea to buy socks.  We bought many pounds of them! You pay basically $2 a pair but you buy in packs. There is a ton of modernism in Seoul so this market was a treat!
87,5.0,"We stayed at Aloft hotel Myeongdong, which is quite near to Namdaemun market. We spent appx 3 hours in Namdaemun tasting different street food, and had a good walkaround. This market is abit messier than Myeongdong but it's really authentic Korean! Don't skip the small dark alley as those are the places that you can possibly find the best and most affordable korean food! Absolutely enjoyed it!"
88,4.0,"This is a street market concept, unlike Myeongdong or Hongdae.Street stalls, street food carts, messy looking shops - all part of this street market atmosphere.Prices here are cheaper no doubt but don't expect to find branded or high quality products here.There is a building within that sells wholesale accessories but purchases has to be in bulk. They don't accept 1 or 2 pieces buy.Atmosphere is nice though especially if weather is cooling. Worth a visit. This place is within walking distance to Myeondong Shopping Street, Namsan Park & Shinsegae Department store."
89,4.0,"We arrived about 19.30 at the market, but we saw that many stands already had closed down (we visited in autumn). The food stands however were still open and we enjoyed some street food from a local elderly couple (who kept on giving us more and more samples for tasting). The dumplings at the corner of a cross road were additionally excellent!"
90,4.0,"If you like shopping, this is the place to go.You can easily spent 3-4 hours in the market. From clothes, shoes, souvenirs and street foods.Must visit in Seoul."
91,5.0,We walked from Myeongdong to Namdaemun Market. It is just opposite and walking distance to there. It is always very crowded for street shopping & foods.
92,4.0,"Our favourite haunt while we were at Seoul. Crazy in the day and crazier at night. Close to seoul station, meongdong and hoeyeon stations.Food, clothes, bags, belts, accessories - anything for a cut price. Happy shopping."
93,4.0,A great place for the food hunter. A lot of choices for shopping also. Nearby subway for easy access. A must go place when u visit korea!
94,5.0,A great place to come visit with hundreds of stalls selling all types of clothes and souvenirs.Saw some of the food stalls on a YouTube blog and had to give the dumplings and hot dog on a stick a try.This market is also very close to Myeondong so definitely check it out.
95,4.0,"Namdaemun Market is just a few blocks from Myeongdong.  Myeongdong seems to attract the younger generations whereas Namdaemum attracts all age groups in general.Namdaemum covers a few city blocks with a few main streets and a lot of alleys.  I found that the whole area is quite confusing.  Most of the stores and vendors sell similar things: clothing, handbags, socks, street food, produce etc.  It is difficult to find a landmark.  If you happen to find the information booth, get a site map and it helps to navigate the area.We visited the area on a Saturday afternoon,  Surprisingly it was not too crowded.  May be it was their National holiday week.  We had a hand-made noodle lunch at a tiny alley which is near the information booth.  The space of that vendor is really tight and it can only seat 4 people.  For US$5, you are served with kimchi, 1 bowl of cold noodle and 1 large bowl of hot noodle soup.  The noodle lady was very friendly and she refilled the kimchi once we finished.  The noodle was very good.  A few days later, we visited again on a week day around 5:30pm.  a lot of the vendors have already closed and only those along the main street were still open.  So if you plan to visit, choose a day visit on the weekend.I didn't see any public washroom in the area"
96,4.0,Market has a great vibe and definitely worth a visit. Beware the grumpy vendors though which seems to be quite common.If you are after tourist souvenir or fast fashion this will be the place to come.Also some great street eats around!
97,3.0,"I expected a much larger variety of goods and food stalls at this market which we did not find.  Most of the shops also close quite early, we arrived after 8pm and very few stores were still open."
98,5.0,"Lots of shops. Eating carts and restaurants. Market is full of clothes, socks, bags, toys etc. nothing much traditional or hand crafts. A good experience though."
99,5.0,"The Namdaemum market isnt as big as the one on Hongik University Street or Ewha University Street or Dongdaemum but it has everything you need. It is quieter than those mentioned above and have cheaper food there. So if you want to just avoid the crowd, I would recommend this place to travellers out there."
100,5.0,"We enjoyed wandering through the various lanes full of shop and barrow vendors. Plenty of casual clothing here, with food, gifts and souvenirs. In the evening there were a couple of streets with food barrow vendors, we ate (standing!) here a couple of times (we found here to be cheaper than the street food vendors in the more up-market Myeongdong area), the vendors were very friendly."
101,5.0,"It is one of the most famous market place in Seoul but I can not say it is real authentic or traditionally local stuffs there.  If you want to see traditional market, buildings or foods, you can go Minsokchon which is abour 1~1.5 hr from Namdaemun market by car.     However Namdaemun sijang(marketplace) provides a lots of street food and inexpensive shopping stuffs.   Near Namdaemun, you also can find out many department stores and find dinning places, if you want to have a different level of shopping/dinning."
102,5.0,"This is the largest market in Korea for clothes, household items and food. We visited here twice, once during the day and once in the evening. We used the subway and exited at Hoehyeon station. We had a very cheap local dinner here and bought some warm clothing for very cheap prices, but quite good quality. You get value for your money here. Nice place to visit. Recommended."
103,5.0,This place is ideal for those who want to buy souvenirs etc.The price here is also cheaper esepecially the fruits.I was amazed by the clothes they are selling for winter because of the fur they've used.Ideal place for wholesale shopping.
104,5.0,"Namdaemun market has a very central location in Seoul next to the Namdaemun gate. It's walking distance to the Seoul station and enxt to Myeongdong.The market is open every day. With many stalls outside that cater for everybody, one shall not forget to visit the many 2/3story malls with fashion accesories, cameras and lenses (new and used), foreign food, flowers, kitchen crockery, stationary, eyewear etc etc.Once at the market, don't forget to view the Namdaemun gate right beside, one of the beautiful gates left from it's earlier citywall."
105,4.0,"This place is the place to shop, lots of good deals and the variety of merchandise available are endless. One can find anything that you need from Korea on the street vendors and the side stores. There's also an underground shopping area for specialty items and Imported merchandise. There are Daytime and Nighttime Vendors on the streets of Namdaemun market."
106,5.0,"On Namdaemun market, the part next to Namdaemun gate, there are some shops with photographic equipment.  They have a lot of stuff, new and used.  Many of the shops are on the main street but do not forget to go to the street behind, there are 3-4 shops visible from the backstreet in a old low building.  If you enter the building you will see that it is kind of a market inside and there are may more photographic shops inside.  So for photographers who are hunting for something old or new in Seoul this is the place to visit.   In other terms the market is just one of many old type markets in Seoul and every visitor should visit at least one of those markets for the experience and fun of it."
107,4.0,"It is a great marked located near the hotel we were staying at.They had street food and some restaurants in the alleyways.The market had everything from socks to pans and souvenirs.It opens in the morning, and closes around 10 o clock."
108,4.0,not far from central. this is one big area with many wholesale market for all types of products. there is also a night market. you need 1 full day to explore all the markets. must visit for tourist.
109,3.0,A few minutes walk from Hoehyeon station. This market is closed on Sunday's and when it rains. We unfortunately chose to go on Sunday and it also started to rain. Lots of street vendors still open but didn't really see anything appealing and left empty handed. Would visit again in hope for a better experience
110,2.0,"This market was directly across from our hotel.  We walked a couple of blocks looking at the shops and carts but was not impressed.  Maybe if we were interested in low scale trinkets, it would have been worth it. They all sold the same stuff also.  We ended up heading to Myeong-Dong market which ended being better. Not Recommended.(To Travel Is To Live)"
111,3.0,More of a local market with a few tourist shops. Not very photogenic in my opinion and we did not stop for long.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
112,3.0,"We strolled the Namdaemun Markets yesterday and took in a little Korean culture.Plenty of bargains to be had, not sure on the quality.  Lots of local foods to sample as you walk the many streets.An easy walk and worth the visit."
113,4.0,A nice market to visit when staying near the Namdaemun Gate area. Good for a kimchi fried Pattie. There is a stall near the south entrance of the market where there are always queues of people during and after work. They sell good fried stuff. Loads of places to eat and buy clothes here. If you are after a beer on the way back to your hotel there is a seven eleven or across the road is a G25 store which also sell reasonably priced good wine. Enjoy ‚ù§Ô∏è
114,5.0,"Be prepared for an assault to the senses.  Frantic market.  Packed, noisy, surprising.  A must see if in Seoul."
115,5.0,"This market was only ten minutes walk from Fraser place hotel. They sold Korean made tshirts, 3 for approx $12 Aud, great value, quality good and they've washed well.Lots of souvenir shops and great prices.Guards from the sungnyemun gate, also close by, parade through here in the afternoon then stand around for tourists to take photos of and with them.Also a small section of fresh produce which was great, strawberries so cheap but oh so sweet!"
116,5.0,This market area was near our hotel so we took a stroll through it.  What fun!  They sell lots of different things.  It is a very colorful place.  Make sure to stop for some steaming hot dumplings or at one of the other food carts.
117,5.0,"Absolutely eye opening and breath taking as a foodie. I live in Singapore, where they practically own the word ""Hawker Centre, but this place is another level. You have to be a little adventurous, however there are some really good eats in here!! I'm highly recommending any of the Kimichi Pancake and Sausage Patty stalls... don't be worried about language, I found it easy ordering and each stall specializes in their own dish, so you can pretty much see what you're ordering... just point and smile!! Loved this place!!"
118,5.0,"We visited the Gwangjang Market two days earlier, which was pretty fun. But this market here is better on every aspect.It is quite a huge area and you might get lost or confused between all the lanes and stalls, even though with a map.The market has sections. Some for jewelery, some for clothes, food, kitchenware and much more. There are one or two bigger streets leading through the bustling and colorful market. Most parts are outside, some sections covered and some parts of it - especially the jewelery - are indoors. Getting a bit lost and wander the lanes are part of the fun. You might find some stuff you want....and never even knew it before. We enjoyed the food here. There is one big food lane and then there are a good number of small stalls and carts selling food. We enjoyed getting a small snack here, another one there....good fun!What we liked best here was the huge selection of clothes. Nice loungewear for low prices and some nice spring/summer dresses. It's not all of great quality, but the prices are really low. Some stalls have fixed prices (like all for 10$). Many have similar products and similar prices, but if time permitted you still might get it cheaper around the next corner. We bought lots of clothes and and turned out to be not bad at all even after a bunch of laundries.We came back two days later to get some more clothes. It's a fantastic market, so bright, lively and colorful. On sundays there is a bit less action and the stalls close a bit earlier, some are even closed fully.So, if you have limited time and only wanna visit one market in Seoul: make it this one!Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile."
119,5.0,"After fruitlessly looking around Dongdaemun market area for clothes (found lots of fabric for sale but few clothes) we headed to Namdaemun and had a great experience. There's lots of jewellery, hair clasps, clothes and bags. I bought some cheap dolsot bowls too. Best of all the guards from Deoksugung end their 'patrol' here after the changing of the guard ceremony at Deoksugung palace (best to follow them from the palace, we just bumped into them). It was very striking to hear their distinctive musicians in unfamiliar surroundings."
120,5.0,"If you got time,  you may stroll around the area.  Good place for cheap shopping. Fashion wise,  it cater older customer I think.  I got some Korean cutlery here,  but actually Daiso have it cheapest"
121,5.0,"Superb touring n informative experience shared by d two (2) staff.We were guided to d South Palace, location of d first (1st) market place, d antique buildings which was built with beautiful flowers carved from d ceiling (Standard Chartered Building) and d Korean Bank.Also the location of d Merchant's Building whereby previously it was used to b notorious for illegal activities."
122,5.0,"I stayed near Hoehyeon Station so I was a few minutes walking distance from Namdaemun Market.  This place has tons of vendors selling a wide variety of items as well as street food and restaurants.  Don't forget to bring cash when you go to the markets.  I think this is a must if you visit Seoul, but Dongdaemun Market is a little better/bigger IMHO."
123,4.0,"Namdaemun offers a wide range of goods and services. You will 3 hours to walk around. Notable specialty shops were florists, jewellery, optical shops selling sun glasses and prescription glasses at very good prices while you wait. Also bags, clothings and accessories. Quite a few traditional Korean foods stalls just in case you are hungry."
124,4.0,"I love shopping and this is the Mecca of shopping. If you want good prices for your stuff then this is it. Everything is in this place. And when you get hungry just turn around and food stalls are everywhere. From bags to shoes to clothes to toys, everything is sold here."
125,4.0,Namdaemun is heaven for souvenirs.... side by side there are selling various souvenirs... price are slightly different .. if u bargain u can have a better price... and make sure to asked for discount.. if u are lucky u can have a huge discount... be friendly and learn hangul little bit to hugle the price....
126,3.0,"Not as exciting as I expected it to be. Certain items are cheap while some are not, especially if you are a tourist. Definitely need bargaining skills if u must shop here. Other than that I would give it a pass"
127,5.0,"Namdaemun Market is a must experience! There are dozens of street and allies with literary hundreds of shops. Cloths, shoes, belts, hats, jewelry, accessories galore, restaurants, spices, Korean food a plenty! You name it, you'll find it here!"
128,4.0,"We went by The Metro to Namdaeumun Market to be confronted with Street after Street of shop sellers displaying their wares.The area was packed with tourists & locals alike - All looking for a bargain or two.Haggling over the price is one of the better reasons for going to any market.An excellent travelling bag was purchased after 25 minutes of haggling over the price with a keen seller & a happy customer.The price of : A$70.00 - was : A$30/40.00 cheaper for the same bag than any where else in Seoul & much cheaper than comparable bags in Toyko.The market covers a wide area offering an amazing range of goods - some really good & some very ordinary.Sellers were friendly & loved a bit of banter & tourists & locals all chimed in to make it an exciting afternoon.A cup of tea & Wifi access @ a nearby Starbucks rounded off a great afternoon,followed by another Metro ride back to our hotel.A visit to the Namdaemun Market is highly recommended when in Seoul."
129,4.0,"Did not know many shops and even building closes on Sundays.  Fortunately, this place is near our hotel so we could go there again. Not a bad place to shop for snacks and accessories.  Can plan to spend 2 hours or so there."
130,4.0,This sprawling market is huge and easy to get lost in. Sells everything from handbags and clothes to street food. Vendors were not pushy it was fairly relaxed.  The prices were good so I bought lots of my souvenirs here.
131,2.0,"If you want to go to the market to buy stuff what you can get at home, fine. There is nothing here to get excited about, shoes bags,clothing,, same as everywhere else. ."
132,4.0,Its not true that they give tax refund or receipts in some stores and be happy when you get a fair price. Lesson is go around before you finally purchased so not to discover higher cost in another stall. Not able to haggle even some discount as fixed prices.
133,4.0,"While you may go there with nothing in mind, you would still come out of that place buying something. Or perhaps eating something. This Market is better in the evening and it has a wide range of goods one can buy. Street food is also a-plenty here and great for a snack or two. One would get a flavour of the local scene here. Defintely worth a visti."
134,3.0,"Namdaemun Market is located in a central location within Seoul. It is easily accessible via subway; alight at Hoehyeon station, exit 5. Be warned that there is no elevator or escalator, but once you walk up the flight of stairs, you are already at the entrance of the market.A good place to get Korea souvenirs, clothing and other fashion items, children's toys, camera equipment and accessories etc, and also to try local food. Note that the prices of the souvenirs here are slightly more expensive than those other markets you find in outlying areas, but the price difference is not huge. There are at least two tourist information booth counters where staff can speak in English and provide you with a map of the market which is divided into different zones selling different items, so do go and make use of these counters before exploring the place."
135,3.0,"I personally did not find this place to be worth visiting. Perhaps for a first timer yes, but I wouldn't visit again. There is not much food. There is supposed to be a noodle Street but I did not try the noodles there thus I cannot say much. Shopping wise, it was quite limited. If you are an avid hiker looking for hiking stuff then you may be able to find some useful things here."
136,5.0,"People are selling everything possible - knick knacks, shoes, clothing etc. The food stalls are plentiful and have all types of deliciousness, we loved the doughnuts and dumplings."
137,5.0,"This market is just across the Courtyard Seoul Namdaemun and it was so lively with street food, ginseng, luggages, flowers, shoes shops, almost anything you ask for."
138,5.0,"I went here for some exotic seafood snacks. Im quite impressed that they have dried octopus. To include raspberry, cherry, squid, pumpkin seeds w/o shell, kiwi, and a looot more. Nature Republic is just like on the street. For 5000 won per pack. Plus you also have free taste. Just bring enough cash (won). Its hard to find money changer. Will come back for more."
139,4.0,"My wife and I visited the Namdaemun Market twice because we found the place so fascinating. The atmosphere there is very similar to the London markets like Camden Market where a wide variety of goods are sold like clothings, jackets , shoes, toys and spectacles on the several streets which make up this market place. In addition, there are many buildings here which house department stores and shops which stock mainly ladies' dresses and apparel. For tourists looking for economically priced clothings and shoes, this is the place to visit . Do allocate about two hours to make your visit worthwhile. I highly recommend this Market ."
140,4.0,This is a great place to stroll through just to see everything that's offered! Best value is the street food. Our favorite was the sweet pancake - so good!
141,3.0,"Having been to many bazaars, street and night markets etc, we were curious to see Namdaemun Market. It's a sprawling market to the southwest of Namdaemun and offers some interesting insights into Koreans' shopping habits (with a focus on electronics in this particular market). But it's no comparison to Istanbul's colourful bazaars or Bangkok's lively night markets."
142,5.0,This is a very huge market and it can take up several hours walking the streets full of shops. I am heading back there the second day just becuase there is so much to do here. A must visit for anyone who likes to shop and eat.
143,5.0,"If you visit Namdaemun, go into buildings and underground to the many arcades they have.  You will be overwhelmed with choices for just about everything you can imagine.  Buying certain items in bulk will give you the opportunity to haggle the prices a bit... if you are only buying one item, you are limited in this department."
144,4.0,"Probably the best place to buy souvenirs. Lots of cheap clothes, all types of accessories. Decent quality stuff, not cheap and nasty. Some good food places, and street food too. Socks 1000won a pair (imitation tommy and polo as well as cartoon characters) Ladies knitted jumpers from 5000won.Hats/beanies from 3000won(Just recalling what my wife bought)"
145,5.0,"Don't just walk the main streets and lanes, duck into the doorways along the side and you will find a whole rabbit warren of shops. Often so closely packed that there is not room to pass someone coming the other way. We found some of our best bits on the second floor after going into one of these doorways. They love to put the price on everything in the market, but this is just the starting price and you need to haggle. Look slightly interested and something can drop 20% in price just to keep your attention. If someone doesn't want to haggle, move on there are plenty of identical items sold in the next shop."
146,4.0,"We always love to try food from different cultures so it's not a surprise that we ended here at the market. We were able to taste bacon wrapped hot dogs, fried dough in many flavors, and more. If you're coming to explore and do a little shopping here is the place.  Do haggle for better prices for souvenir pieces."
147,4.0,This is the place to visit on your last day to Seoul to buy Korean art pieces and souvenirs for your loved ones and friends back home. Relatively cheaper than those seen in Insadong. I suggest buying your souvenirs at the 2nd floor of the Mall/Building (which name I forgot) as they sell products at wholesale price as compared to the stores outside. Other local products can be bought here. There are also food stalls all over the place (Some were featured in SBS or MBC) so you can also have a try. Banks can also be found within the market so you can always get extra cash just in case you fell short.
148,5.0,"Namdaemun Market is a fun place to buy anything and everything as well as to eat lots of traditional Korean street foods such as hhotteok (pancakes), spicy rice cakes, dumplings (mandoo), etc.  Korean market sellers are never pushy or aggressive and one cannot really bargain anymore.  I always get a few new pairs of Rx glasses  (while I wait!) and some small leather goods (very good quality) inside the market buildings.  This market is much smaller than Dongdaemun so much more manageable."
149,4.0,"Went to Namdaemun market and it is a combination of wet market and shopping streets. The shops here are older than Myeongdong and they sell items almost similar to those shops in Myeongdong. Apart from popular brands, shops in Namdaemun also sell masks from not-so popular brands and a mask costs as low as $0.30 to $0.50. Do ask for free gifts if you purchase in a bulk."
150,5.0,Wonderful trip in South Korea. We are so lucky have a very good guide to show us aroundüëçwe hope we be back soon for shopping and beauty care.
151,4.0,"This is a big area where you can find bargains in food, shoes and clothings, amongst other things. You could also do a bit of bargaining if you are buying in larger quantities, but do not discount too much or they might just ignore you."
152,5.0,If you want to see true local market and the cheapest prices.. go to this place....my wife had a blast... she bought fur coats and jackets while a bought a few camping gears... street fooda are also different but also good in this market...
153,3.0,"Yes we were told it was so, so we dropped by and see for ourselves!  Just outside of Hoehyun subway is the famous Namdaemun market.Dating back to 1414 this Korea‚Äôs largest and oldest market is a huge retail place with over 10,000 stalls!! Indeed countless shops and street stalls lined the many main/side alleys. Famous for lower-prices and hospitality; you can literally find anything you want here. From Fashion wears like clothing, jewelry, bags, etc to Food (Chinese & local). There are both street food vendors in carts and also shop houses. Great place to walk around and explore looking for that ideal sweaters, fur coats, kids wear too. We bought local snacks and also some light korean kitchenwares, good value. Prices are competitive though not exactly compelling.. :> . We also load up some local products like seaweed, kimchi powder, ginseng sweets. . We dropped by here twice once after visiting the SHINSEGAE Mall.  Indeed a great shopping experience very unlike the equally famed Myeongdong (also nearby).  However this area is lesser hype to the youngsters so we saw more elder and family purchases. A good way to immense with the locals, and be prepared to be treated like one too!!"
154,4.0,"This market is a mix of regular outdoor market and small shops that stretches for several blocks of this neighborhood. Many locals and tourists shop here for food, clothing, souvenirs, etc. Bring cash and be ready to bargain a bit. Many stalls sell street food to go. Beware of some knock offs."
155,5.0,"This is a great place to Christmas shop.  Lots of vendors and food, you find some of everything at this market. Easy to get too, right down from the train station.  Requires a visit at least once while in Seoul."
156,3.0,"I dont find it special, just a market on the street, especially having been to Gwangjang market earlier in the day.You can get the same stuffs in other places as well."
157,4.0,"Namdaemum market is a great place to shop for anything you need, may need, and stuff you thought you never need at a discount prices. My wife and I spent few hours looking for traditional Korean gift items as well as grab a quick meal at one of those hole in the wall (but so good). If you're looking for Korean Jewelry box, etc., then you should find a multi story indoor shops/mall rather than those lining the streets at Namdaemum. You'll get a better deal."
158,4.0,"Locals and tourists alike shop here for anything and everything.  It's fun and busy and you can definitely find something to buy.  I suggest trying one of the food shops ...the food is as fresh as you can get..they cook it right when you order.  I noticed that the vendors cut the tags off everything..so, you don't know the size (typically one size fits all) and more importantly...how do you launder it!?We bought trinkets for the grandkids and not much more."
159,4.0,"We were staying at the nearby Westin Chosun Hotel, and as Namdaemun Market was part of all the tour itineraries and just a short walk away, we decided to see what all the fuss was about.  I'm not sure that it qualifies as a cultural site, but it is a refreshing contrast to the nearby upmarket department stores and the youth-oriented Myeongdong shopping strip.  The emphasis seems to be on clothing (there is a wonderful children and baby's section, and my husband thought that the silk ties were outstanding), but there are also plenty of traders who deal in jewellery, luggage and bags.  Although some items have a similar look to name brands, it was reassuring that we didn't encounter any ""knock-offs,"" with dealers competing on price and quality rather than by using a fake logo.  Unless you are a very dedicated shopper you won't want to spend more than a couple of hours at the market, but you should come away with a bargain."
160,4.0,"This market was right across from our hotel (Tmark Grand).  It's definitely an older style market which they sell thing such as socks, clothing, hats, home things, etc. They also have food stands. The one food stand that stood out to me was these bulgogi vegetable buns that cost 2000 for the meat one, 1500 for the vegetable one. They taste amazing fresh!  It is a must try but sometimes the food stand isn't there! She works some days. They also had some good coffee stands there if you were looking for a cheaper coffee place in the morning as oppose to the $6 (Canadian) coffee you find at your hotel or the local Starbucks. This market dies down around 10pm.Do NOT go to the massage place upstairs on the Main Street with the pink banner. Very disguising and dirty. They did not wash the sheets as someone else came out of the room after a massage session."
161,2.0,"It feels like Ladies Market of Hong Kong and Chinatown in Malaysia and Singapore. They have street food like the spicy rice cakes, meat dumplings, pig trotters etc.For a taste of Pasar Malam (market), you can try. Some stores starts closing at 6pm."
162,4.0,"recommended by my Korean guide that this is wholesale market for children stuff. Bought shoes , clothes and toys for my kids. We bought at Myeongdong before and cost much more. So this place is the right place for kids stuff. U Can buy ginseng too"
163,3.0,"Rustic feel and shops. Good for a walk and you may also discover small alleys with local foods. We had spicy fish in stone pot. Cleanliness is ok, but pretty tight spaced alley. If you like some kind of adventure this might suit you."
164,5.0,"I like it too much where you see a real Korean culture, food, shops and lifestyle. In Mamdaemun Market you are going to touch the Korean lifestyle. Dont miss it."
165,2.0,"Went there, saw lots of clothes, no place to eat. The place is small and crowded. If you like markets you might like it."
166,5.0,"According to my travel guide, this is the largest market in Korea.  There are rows of shops and stalls where you can buy food, clothing and home goods.  Since I'm not a big fan of seafood or meat, the smells turned me off and only made me walk even faster through those sections.  Travel is about the experience.  This is definitely one you should do!"
167,4.0,"The market is a great place to stroll and see what you might want to buy but depending on what you are looking for. If you are looking to buy clothing or souveniers, this will be a great place to buy them. Note:  The market is a very big place and there are many many shops to shop.  It is probably good to go around lunch time that way you can enjoy some of the street food and shop at the same time.  You can bargin here too and if one shop does not meet your spending point there are many more shop to go shopping.  Overall, it's just a good stroll around the market and enjoy the view and food."
168,4.0,"Namdaemun is always worth a visit.  Give yourself at least a half day or more.  And if you are really looking for shopping bargains, we'll go after dark (that is what my Korean wife tells me).  I visit Korea at least yearly now and we always go to Namdaemun.  We both enjoy it, she shops and I look around and eat.For anyone visiting, there are information personnel located throughout the market.  Usually a younger man and woman, dressed in red with a big ""I"" on a hat or jacket.  They are very helpful, especially if you are traveling alone or don't have a Korean speaker with you.Have fun, bring a camera and enjoy this market place.DDS"
169,4.0,This market had the best prices. There was a variety of food and merchandise. You  can bargain with the vendors. Lots of interesting stalls.
170,4.0,I found it a bit to pricy and depending where in the market you are it a bit of a tourist trap. It's definitely worth a visit but if your out for streetfood I would recommend Myeongdong instead.
171,5.0,"Plenty of shops and food.  Good market food.  The other stuff seems overpriced a bit, but it is souvenirs in a touristy spot, it is expected.  Still worth going for sure."
172,4.0,"This is a large market covering a large area. Unfortunately, if you don't look like or speak Korean, prices tend to be high and negotiating is not usual."
173,4.0,If u wanna find souvenir in seoul u need to go here because it its the cheapest market. But its close in sunday. So make sure u come in week day
174,5.0,Loads and loads of Korean food stalls. Huge variety to choose from. From fresh seafood to intestines and blood sausage. Locals come here for family dinners in big groups. The food all gets freshly prepared whilst you sit down. Foreigners would love this as you blend in and eat with Korean families.
175,5.0,You could happily spend a couple of hours exploring this market...whole areas devoted to ginseng for example. The food alleys were great - a health and safety free zone with plenty to tempt the more adventurous diner!
176,2.0,"I was expecting it to be better. I bought a couple of belts but I saw them at other market stalls around other parts of seoul. We walked for hours, and really it was rubbishy and not particularly cheap (you can haggle down to about half price). I wish I'd gone some where else as didn't have many days there."
177,3.0,Old market sell a lot of souvenirs here. And many restaurant.. near heoh yeon subway station. Big place. Close at 9 pm. Not so intresting for me...............
178,4.0,"The shopping on many streets in Korea is exciting and fun. Once you've seen one, you've seen them all. I didn't find anything uniquely special about this market. However, if it's your first time visiting Korea, definitely go and haggle with the vendors about price. Street shopping in Korea is super fun!"

The other day we had noodle soup and bimbimbap...very tasty must try and visit...."
180,4.0,"This market is a good one to explore, but it is a maze with more trash than treasures. However, there are some gems, especially if you're looking for unique kids clothes. Follow the maps to the sections that interest you."
181,2.0,I had no luck trying to find a time these markets were open. Monday night - closed - Wednesday morning (around 6am) closed.  We were looking forward to street food and a wander through the wares in Korea - however this wasn't to be the case I felt like I kept missing something obvious! So I wish you much more luck than I had!
182,4.0,"Namdaemun Market is one of the largest and oldest retail market in Seoul. Most of the transportation of goods in the market are by motorcycle and hand-drawn carts. You can reach this market by using subway or bus and closest Subway is Hoehyeon Station.Much of the market is outside, but there are also many stores which line the streets. You can buy anything and everything in this market. Clothes, Shoes, Food items‚Ä¶ all are available in this market and each category of items has section in the market. There are also multistory malls all across the street so you can shop on street as well as on malls.Even if you don‚Äôt want to do Shopping.. I suggest do find time to visit this market. Also, try local food on street specially Pan cakes. No doubt why this market is rated as Asia‚Äôs Greatest Street for shopping & food. Give yourself about 2-3hrs to go around and enjoy shopping culture of Korea... I am sure you will like it."
183,5.0,"Local markets are the best way to experience a culture !  Food, clothing, daily goods, and tourist souvenirs are just a few of the goods on offer.  We spent two hours there and didn't even know that there was more on the opposite side of the main road."
184,4.0,"Ok, I've read some of the other reviews about Namdaemun. You need to be informed what you are getting into so your hopes are not to high or expectation to low. This place is a DIVE!!! It's multiple buildings all joined together with individual sellers selling their various wares. The ones on the outer edge are much more expensive than the ones a little further in. Do not be afraid to walk away if you do not like the price! Many times they will call out to you as you are leaving and sell the item to you for your offered price.I found that Korea has beautiful little items, trinkets for the females back home you want to get souvenirs for but the men folk, nothing. Most Korean tourist items are very feminine. Someone else may not have that impression but that is my impression. Namdaemun is mainly a clothing and textile market. Many buyers from all the Asian countries come here to make clothes orders and to buy textiles to export for their own clothes making operation. The food is good and most places are relatively inexpensive. You can easily spend all day in this market however, it is only closed for 24 hours during the whole year! So you can use this as a place to go on a late evening excursion if you wish. Unless your luck is like mine. My first time to go was on the one day it was closed!"
185,3.0,"It's the usual fare of clothes,  food,  jewellery etc.  Crowded,  I went to have a look did not find anything that particularly got my attention,  spend about 10mins there was enough for me."
186,3.0,"Due to my hotel being located on one of the streets where this market sprawls, it was a must visit. Unlike traditional markets that tend to be specifically a market location, this market shares its surrounds with local stores and food places.The market is advertised as being open from 8.30 but realistically I think it has most of its stores opening after 9.30. It has an large array of shops selling cheap shoes, clothes, souvenirs and plenty of food.I would say a visit to Seoul without spending time here would be like going to Paris and not visiting the Eifel Tower. It's a must place to visit even if markets aren't your thing."
187,4.0,"Lots of people shopping and snacking. Huge crowds checking out the street vendors wares. Mostly hats ,T shirts, clothing, wallets, purses, cell phone cases, jewelry etc interspersed with snack food vendors selling octopus, squid, vegetable snacks, crepes and assorted deep fried Korean snack food. Very popular with tourists from Japan and China. Don""t miss this big market as it really provides a unique market atmosphere."
188,4.0,Walk around the market. To be honest I didn't have my meal there as we were too full from our lunch.After lunch we went there. Found out they have alot of food.ALOT!!!different kind of variety. Like chinese food. Korean Street food.They have plenty of stall. Selling food and fruits and many other hardware/ traditional item. Some stall are repeating.Surrounding that area they have alot of shop selling cheap fruits. Don't go buying at supermarket as they are the same buy supermarket are expensive. When I compared.
189,5.0,"If you want to see what a Korean street  market feels like, I would make this your first stop. You'll get a mix of clothes, jewelry and food vendors. Be adventurous and try all the unique food stands, they're all delicious."
190,5.0,"When I first came here 4 years ago, I enjoyed the street food and atmosphere thoroughly. 4 years on, I still love this place and make it a point to spend a morning here during my annual Seoul ""pilgrimage"". What's awesome here? Food! Hotteok, toast and basically any street food that they sell here. If you enjoy fish, there is a famous  small lane with tiny shops that sell grilled fish (called galchi jorim or scabbard fish) in either stews or whatever that fish can go in! Galchi meat is really sweet but it has like a gazillion small bones that probably only Asian fish-lovers would appreciate. I know the husbands hated it LOL. Still, it was pretty cool to sit with the locals and just order anything off the menu even though nothing was in English and you don;t know what you just ordered. Other recommended food and a must-eat in my humble opinion - the toast. If you like Isaac Toast, pls try this version from this old ahjumma and you will never feel the same again. Thick toasts pan fried with butter, vegetable omelette, mayo, sugar, ketchup. It's really awesome and other versions we have tried in different parts of Seoul pales in comparison. This old lady is located just behind the main info counter in the centre of the market, opposite a big The Face Shop outlet. I also enjoy buying socks, wrapping paper and ribbons from the market. The designs are so pretty and they are so cheap compared to what we get even from the wholesale shops in Singapore. The quality is really good too and hard to beat. There are many shops selling seasoned seaweed as well. You can bargain and negotiate for better prices but I've since learnt to load up at the Lotte Mart instead. Great fun to be here, try it and come with an empty stomach!"
191,4.0,"With entire streets dedicated to similar offerings (from womens wear, shoes, toys, arts supplies to childrens wear) this is a very nice market to visit."
192,4.0,"The market offered food, clothes and souvenirs, a good place to walk around and look for cheap stuffs. We liked this place over Dongdaemun market."
193,3.0,Wholesale quality products .You should not expect the trendy or good quality products.But might be suitable for the person to find big amount of souvenir back to the others.
194,5.0,Good place to buy souvenirs but make sure you bargain! The vendors will jack up the price if they suspect you are a tourist.  Be careful.
195,4.0,"There are literally, hundreds upon hundreds of little shops and stalls.  Anything you want is here.  There is clothing for all ages, cosmetics, facial products of all types, footwear, backpacks, purses, brollies, kitchen ware, jewelry, watches, etc.  All kinds of food stalls as well.  Don't know what half of the food items are but they look and smell delicious.  You can easily spend a couple of hours in this market.  We did twice.  Prices are good and you may be able to haggle a little bit on the price."
196,4.0,Very typical Korean market place. Wide selection of shopping and food options. It does get confusing walking around and is easy to get lost. Lots of the stores look alike and sell similar items. One tip especially looking for souvenir type gifts. Don't limit your search to the vendors on the ground floor. There are vendors in the structures on the 2nd floor. You will find better deals.
197,3.0,"A lot of shop offer a various things: clothes, watches, bags, shocks, souvenirs, event ginseng..the prices are reasonable, and you can bargain too. The sellers are friendly."
198,4.0,The whole area is filled with variety of stuffs to buy. Though beware not all are made in Korea but nonetheless a chance to bask in Korean community market and also for some people watching too
199,5.0,"We went to Namdaemun Market as part of our full day Seoul City Tour. It was the last stop, so we were pretty tired. We enjoyed ""window shopping"" through the neighborhood. Definitely worth the visit to pick up a few gifts for family."
200,3.0,"Quite nice to have a general browse, however a lot of the stores sell the same tat and can be found all over Seoul in other shopping areas and underground malls. It was nice to walk around an authentic Korean Market, but I felt there was little to really see."
201,3.0,"The market was OK, nothing wrong with it,  just seen many bigger and better ones across Asia.  So if this is one of your first,  it will be awesome. Also not as cheap as China."
202,4.0,"Easy to get to via the Seoul subway, this is your typical Asian market place - plenty of fresh produce, cheap clothing, bags and luggage, toys, street food, etc.  There are numerous free and relatively clean toilets, modern coffee vendors, and street money changers.  Some haggling seems to be allowed; others wouldn't be in it.  It got busier as the morning went on.Good for a visit if your are looking for cheap stuff or like this style of market."
203,3.0,Thought u should visit this place since i have heard quite a bit about it. There's many street hawker selling local produce. Not really my cup of tea but nice to visit just for the experience.
204,3.0,"Namdaemun Market is one of the traditional markets your local guide would want you to visit on your stay in Seoul. Although it has a lot of selections in store for different kinds of people, you can't avoid some snobby shopkeepers who would get angry if you try to bargain. The reason why you'd bargain in the first place is that most shops in Namdaemun sell items at very expensive prices because of their tourist attraction status. Most of the items they're selling are made from China, but you can also find some reasonably priced items located near the outskirts of the market. I wouldn't suggest going here if you're looking for souvenirs and on a budget, but for foodies however, you'll be pleased to know that they also have a fine selection of streetfoods you couldn't find in other places such as Myeong-Dong.If you're looking to buy great quality clothing for a reasonable price, I would suggest going to Migliore across Dongdaemun Design Plaza. As for hand bags and trendy backpacks, you'll be able to find great deals at Insa-dong as both of them are priced for the locals."
205,2.0,"I have been here a few times and nothing has changed since which is good but I never felt like this is a place I like. The streets are small and during the peak period, it is crowded and the things here are not exactly cheap as they say. I only came here to buy some socks and thats it I am gone. It might be better for some others."
206,5.0,"Awesome place to choose whatever your soul desires. Got lots of small things that make a big difference daily. Moderate prices, kind people and bargains that you can make with shoppers. Overall a great experience."
207,4.0,I really like to get inexpensive souvenirs since I have a rather large extended family and I haven‚Äôt found many places with decently priced souvenirs as of yet in South Korea. I sure found them here. Maddaemun market reminds me very much like a Chinese nightmarket without the multiple food vendors. Many of the stalls have the same material but that is to be expected at any market of this type. They do have backpacks and clothes but I wouldn‚Äôt rely on its quality. I usually just buy souvenirs and food at these types of places. I recommend you come to Namdaemun before you visit Myeongdong otherwise you will feel a little scummy. It‚Äôss not bad but Myeongdong is just that good and again they are very close to each other in distance. This is also a great place to exchange your money.
208,3.0,Place to go if you need socks. Besides a lot of cheap stuff. Some food stands. Don't more than half an hour.
209,5.0,"I bought a jacket which is 10,000 won here. And food here also cheap . If u want to buy bag , jacket , souvenir, blanket etc here is cheap . U can see at here a lot old ppl , ppl selling thing also is aunts n uncle . They are friendly and nice . I bought a lot souvenir here bring back to Malaysia . If u want buy jacket pls come here . üëçüëç"
210,5.0,"Great shopping area to spend time, You can get lucky if you are good at bargain. Don't miss the best tasting Dumpling shop around the corner, not easy to miss, since it will be crowded with people waiting online to buy dumplings."
211,5.0,We go to these markets each trip to up date our fur collection. Its all there at all qualities and prices.  This trip I bought a neck warmer for about US$30 in Rex (like rabbit). And a white fox neck warmer for about US$100.
212,4.0,"Easy to find from the station, you practically walk into the market from the station.   Clothing, a huge jewelry area, food, great dumplings, souvenirs.  There are stores inside buildings as well as outside.  Some places will bargain others won't."
213,4.0,Pleanty of shops and merchadise for good prices. the people are very nice too. The are a lot of things to buy too.
214,4.0,"Some reviews already told the story - night market selling local products (fashions, shoes, socks, gloves, hats, snacks with food stalls.  We found one that cooked knife slice noodles plus sticky rice in a narrow lane - yummy yummy.  However, when compared to the MyeongDong shopping street that is with more modern feel to the younger generations, you will find this one bearing more local Korean feel and has more products suitable to relatively matured customers.  Remember to bargain the price as you may achieve good rewards.  If you don't speak Korean language, use the calculator to tell your desired prices.  We also went into the several shopping buildings and found some shops were wholesale in nature."
215,5.0,You can see the frozen dogs in the fridge inside the food market for sale that it was really scary............But don't miss the sliced salty pork legs
216,4.0,"The market is an awesome cultural experience, and it is definitely enjoyable whether you intend to buy anything or not. We sampled some of the street food, all of which was delicious (but definitely not healthy). Definitely a worthwhile activity while in Seoul, and it's quite close to Deoksugung, one of the palaces, so it's easy to pair the two like we did."
217,3.0,Nothing much for us to shop on more fashionable items. This place is more traditional and more for the locals. Food stalls are aplenty.
218,5.0,"It is a wholesale and retail market. It is open at regular hours but some shops, also through the night. We went at 2:00A.M. and it was interesting."
219,4.0,"Well worth the visit and 1. A unique way of looking into the amount of marine life we humans eat,  and,  2. A unique way of looking into the Korean culture and their way of living,  by seeing,  unprocessed,  their unique eating habits.The sheer amount of fresh marine life that is consumed fresh is mind boggling. And a credit to the Korean dedication to good healthy food. We didn't see many or any obese people in all of Sth Korea."
220,5.0,"This is a great market with local flavors. There are heaps of restaurants and stores. Depending on what entrance you enter, you will see different kinds of goods sold. Clothes, shoes, hiking sticks, camera stores, luggage, uniforms, underwear, watches, eyeglasses etc. this market has just about anything. The area is huge. Budget some time to walk around and try local food."
221,2.0,"I thought this would be more fun than it actually was. Most of the stuff seems like old people things. Lots of winding paths. The shops are overflowing with stuff. Lots of people there too. Cars and motorcycles still squeeze through the crowds and they expect you to move for them. It won't bother the, one bit if they hit you. We ended up leaving pretty quickly because it was all just too overwhelming. Tips to note: when I was researching this place before our trip the Internet said that it was open 24 hours. With this in mind I planned to go here to end our evening. However when we arrived, it looked like a ghost town. The next morning we asked the desk at our hotel why it was closed. He said that Dongdaemun market was the one you should go to at night and that you should go to Namdaemun market in the day. And like I said, it was packed in the day.Also there is an information booth where you can get a map and there are also information people in red walking around you can ask if you get lost."
222,5.0,This place is unbelievable. From food to clothes to whatever. It is really fast pace. Good if you are hungry. Hundreds of vendors so get your cash ready.
223,4.0,"Although it was a rainy Sunday morning, the market was coming alive with many options for purchases. A cheap and tasty breakfast of dumplings (both sweet and savoury were on offer), lots of ginseng products, clothes and souvenirs. Worth a stroll through and I'm sure it's much more interesting at night and when it's not rainy."
224,4.0,"Excellent food, candy, fruit, fresh sea goods, kimchi, and all ingredients required for their tasty food. Recommended for couples and thrifty / adventurer travelers."
225,4.0,"It's easy to get there, it's just near the station. There are shops lining the roads that sells sporting goods especially fishing, skiing stuff, optical shops etc. The market starts from the lanes leading to the main area at the bottom of the road where there are shops and shops selling clothings from children to adults. Didn't shop much as most of the shops carry winter stuff but did some shopping at the stalls selling tee shirts, track bottoms and track tops. Managed to shop for some ginseng at the wholesalers, only realised it's cheap after browsing at the airport duty free shops, it's twice the price at the wholesalers. Buy at the wholesalers, it's worth the trip there ..."
226,5.0,"Lots of places to eat, but not much variety. There are a few spots that cater to north Americans but overall this is a great place to bounce around and take in all the excitement (or drinks)Night time is especially exciting with huge flashing lights. Bars don't pick up until around 9.Make sure to walk through the alleys. It's quite an experience."
227,2.0,"Big market with lots of duplicated stores, the a regular night market in Taipei or Bangkok.Big area to see. I did not manage to comb all the area as it was too boring i spent less than 45mins"
228,3.0,"Popped by Namdaemun Marker to have a look. Was disappointed that there's not much to see. Shops were mainly selling pots and pans, socks, Korean ginseng. Inside the market were also shops that sold fresh food. Might be good if you were going to cook."
229,4.0,"Well worth the stop if you have time, a mix of chaos, modernity and action. Its fun to walk through and take in the sights while also experiencing the hustle and bustle. Don't expect a traditional market but rather a working market."
230,5.0,"Having grown up in Korea (5th-12th grades), Namdaemun was always a great place to go shopping.  The prices are good, but you still can bargain a bit.    Make sure you go into the buildings, especially the one that has jewelry... stall after stall after stall...  and you will often see women gluing tiny stones into jewelry pieces."
231,4.0,"One of the biggest traditional market‚Ä¶. Affordable especially the whole sale stuff like clothes, kitchen ware, toys, sporting equipment‚Äôs, accessories, ginseng and much more.It‚Äôs a place to see."
232,3.0,Quite disappointed because I reached there only around 1030pm and all the stalls were closed. The only stalls there that were open sold souvenirs at a hefty price and did not allow for negotiations!
233,3.0,"We took the 4 line and got off at the Hoehyeon station which left us just a short one block walk to get to the market. There weren't any items at the market I couldn't get anywhere else but the atmosphere was busy and exciting. We went on a Sunday morning but the pace really picks up in the middle of the afternoon. We purchased some Korean string candy and some shoes. I didn't feel like prices were cheap but prices weren't expensive either. We were able to haggle the price of our shoes down 15k. Paying in cash as opposed to using a credit card will give you more leverage for haggling. The highlight of the afternoon was our lunch. We stopped in one of the Korean food shops in one of the side alleys. There were displays of all of the menu items out in front of the restaurant. We got some kimchi fried rice and kimchi chicken, a 20oz. beer and all the side dishes for 17k. The waitress was very nice and gave my wife a few  free facial masks to try. Overall it was worth the trip. There are nicer shops within walking distance if you don't prefer the street market style."
234,4.0,We enjoyed meandering through this market shopping for souvenirs. It's  a grittier version of Insadong street. Also contained household goods and clothing shops. Some of the stalls were willing to barter on pricing.
235,5.0,"This is a mix of touristy and local deals crowded into a side street. This market is pretty famous, especially for the night market, but we went for the deals during the day. Closely located to the Myeong-dong market nearby, Namdaemun definitely has more locals and better deals. We picked up everything on our list for presents/souvenirs (ex. Tshirts, scarves, bracelets/accessories) and also a good stop for lunch. Lots of children here as well because many of the deals are clothes for children, very stylish. Caution on bringing strollers or kids though because it is very crowded."
236,4.0,"Clean and traditional market, friendly local people. A lot of traditional food can be found here. Tourist gift shop sell Ginseng drink too expensive, better buy in local pharmacy shop or provision shop. It's cheaper."
237,4.0,"I've been here a few times now and still enjoy it. Sometimes I'll go for something to do and walk around without buying anything. But it can be very HOT and STUFFY in the summer so watch out for that.This place isn't ginormous but can feel like a maze and is broken up into sections. I suggest going to Google Image (Namdaemun Market Map) and printing one out to bring with you. Some of the sections and items include: stationary, clothing, accessories, watches/jewelry, kitchenware, shoes, food, etc.I think it's a good market with reasonable prices. The typical souvenirs you'll find everywhere (shot glasses, coin purses, magnets, etc.) were the same price here (if not a little cheaper) than in the rest of the shops around Seoul. I suggest walking around first before buying things. Like most markets, you see the same thing over and over again.Tips/Notes/Advice for Haggling/Bargaining:-Walk around first and ask for prices on things you're interested in. Depending on the item, the price will usually vary between a couple of won (about $1-2) to about 5,000-15,000 won (about $5-15). -I'm a tough bargainer. When I go to buy something I usually offer half (or a little more than half) of what the seller is asking (this way I can work my way up). If I can't reach an agreement with the seller I start to walk away, they usually cave and give into the price but if not I just go to another seller and do it all over again.-I usually don't haggle/bargain when there's a price tag on something UNLESS I am buying more than one. Sometimes the seller will give you a discount on something if you're buying more than one or they might even give you a little something for free depending on the total amount you spend. This doesn't always apply but a good rule of thumb is ""the more you buy, the bigger the discount.""-If haggling/bargaining isn't your thing, don't worry. Just pay the amount the seller is asking (if you think it's a reasonable amount) and go on your merry way. -Some of the sellers pay no attention to you until you ask a question and some will stand right next to you saying ""you like this one, good price, you buy?"" If you feel smothered or uncomfortable don't be afraid to walk away. Are you getting here by subway? Take Line #4, get off at Hoehyeon Station and use exit 5, 6 or 7.Looking for a bunch of skincare and makeup stores? Namdaemun Market is within walking distance of Myeongdung (this area has a lot of them). Just walk a couple of blocks East. You can use Google Image (Myeongdong Shopping Map) to find specific stores."
238,3.0,"we just signseeing things at Namdaemun Market, there's a stuff to sell but not to interesting. maybe this place for locals and grocery shop. I just buy a korean soccer tshirt for USD 4. it's cheap."
239,3.0,"If you have never seen an Asian outdoor market, this is a great beginners version since it's quite safe, clean, and near multiple subway stops to prevent getting too lost.  Most everything is low end in quality.  They don't seem too thrilled about bartering.  Definite variety of clothes, shoes, watches, purses, bags, dishes... just lots of stuff.  I don't think it's quite a destination in itself, though."
240,4.0,"It seems most people will wander through here at some point, even if you don't need anything. There are friendly people ready to answer questions or give you a guide map to the market as there are different areas for different items (women's clothes, sporting goods, kids clothes, housewares, cameras, etc). You can get some fun socks for KW1,000. Plenty of food options, too."
241,3.0,"If it's your first time in Seoul, by all means pay a visit to observe the 'culture'. Honestly if you're looking for shopping, you'll be disappointed. Basically, most of the stalls sell socks (yes, socks) and souvenirs. The seaweed and ginseng are extremely expensive (suggest to buy seaweed at LOTTE mart). There are no decent indoor sit-down restaurants, only outdoor stalls with plastic tents over them. On separate occasions I took my mum and my husband and both times we left after less than 1 hour. In my opinion, it is like a crappy version of ladies' bazaar in Mongkok, Hong Kong."
242,5.0,"We spent two days in this area and we loved the diversity of goods here. It's huge and seems endless and yes, it may seem redundant after a while. But the vendors are nice and friendly. During the day it's shops and by night it's food court haven. Definitely a place to see if you're in the area."
243,4.0,"A very nice street market. The variety of merchandise was limited, but prices are pretty good. Recommended for every visitor in Seoul."
244,5.0,"I would only recommend the Namdaemun Market area to people who genuinely likes the traditional Korean/Asian street scene. You will find the place packed full of people and street stands with vendors selling various items from clothes, bags, traditional goods to a very interesting mix of different street foods. If you are like me; use to living in a suburbia environment back home, then you might find the place confronting and even intimidating. Please give it some time and you will find your favourite stall/section. The place really feels like its coming alive and you will be overwhelmed with all that is going on around you. Definitely a place for singles or couples. If you have young children beware! motor cycles and small trucks often move through the area. Make sure you keep a tight reign on the young ones."
245,4.0,"Reputed to be the largest market in Korea. There are countless shops and street stalls lining its alleys selling clothes, bags, shoes, household items and food. The prices are reasonable and haggling for the best price, to get a great bargain would be an enthralling experience."
246,2.0,"Unfortunately I cannot post a good review and also unfortunately it was one street food vendor that forced this review.  Obviously not everyone in this area is a crook, so it's unfortunate, but I feel I can help others not get cheated.We decided to eat outside in a street food stall and the woman was very friendly(now I know why).  Honestly, I am partially to blame for being naive.  I lived in Vietnam for 5 years. China for 2 years, and Japan for 2 years.  In Vietnam it's common practice for street food vendors to rip off tourists who can't speak Vietnamese.  I was only ripped off in Vietnam when I first arrived.  After learning some basic Vietnamese and costs, it never happened again.  In Japan, I was never ripped off, not once.  I expected that since Korea somewhat looks like Japan and ""feels"" a bit like Japan that the culture of merchants would be similar.  I should have asked for a price of the food up front, so that's a mistake I made.  However, I don't feel like this is a valid reason to charge triple price.  I would advise anyone eating in a street food stall to agree to a price before they cook it.Basically, we got a few dishes and 2 drinks and it ended up costing 92,000 won.  Obviously we knew it wasn't right, but I didn't know how to handle the situation.  The place was full of Koreans and in my experience, questioning a native's integrity in the midst of other natives doesn't end well.  So basically we swallowed it and paid and then when I paid with 100,000 won she had the nerve to give me back 10,000 and say ""discount"".  She was a thieving, rotten person and I don't want to judge all the people in this area, but I'm sure this is a common practice, so be very careful when dealing with the street food vendors.I was honestly very surprised that this happened because I really thought that my experience in a developed country would be similar to other developed countries.  Lesson learned.We did go to the Tourist Police and reported her and the location and showed them photos and a receipt, so hopefully she received some type of fine."
247,5.0,We went to this market and were amazed by the selections. There were lots of good quality korean design items at bargaining price. 3 hrs were not enough for us to explore. We came back a few days later to fulfill our shopping desires.. U can shop till u drop here without much worry being ripped off..
248,4.0,"For a fascinating day out or just a couple of hours, you will be mesmorised by the action packed markets which have a sometimeslowkey feel but is a bustling market place. Whether you want lingerie or hairbands, childrens clothes or hiking gear, this is the place to go to. I found it intriguing and colourful, with quality clothing for reasonable prices available and experienced a buzz just walking through. Great for photographers!!"
249,4.0,"Namdaemun Market is near Naddaemun Palace gate-reachable from Hyeleon and Myeongdong subway stations on Seoul trains line 4.It is not one market but a place for many commodities-ladies purses, luggage bags, office bags,leather belts,shoes for all ages,stationary, garments , traditional Korea handicrafts items, winter wear, foods-Korean, Chinese and Western style- Ginseng all are bargain able- no price is fixed- compared to big shops and malls prices are genuine 50% less-cards are accepted but tell the shopkeeper in advance."

251,5.0,"It's one of the best market I been visit on the world due to many and many things you can buy with good price and a very good Korean made quality.  I brought so many things clothes,  silver,  bags,  electronic devices. .and so many there which personally recommend and must visit this market and I I'm sure you'll never forget it and feel sorry about it.Regards"
252,4.0,"Huge market with everything what you may imagine and even not,stalls of clothes, shoos,souvenirs, here is place to buy some charming things with shells incrustations ,here it much cheaper then in special shops in malls, but at all prices higher then in Taipei's markets,for same items.After noon you have there much stalls on passage with food,it cheap,and it worth to test it."
253,4.0,"If you are into bargain hunting for shirts, souvenirs, good street food, and a lot more, then this is the place to go.It isn't that big for you to get lost, but with so many things to see, we found the place very interesting. Around late in the afternoon to evening, the food carts arrive and it is a must try.They offer from waffles, to donuts, to fried octopus, and of course coffee!If you want branded items, Myeongdong is the place to go. However, if you want bargains and have a feel of Seoul's street market, then head to Namdaemun."
254,4.0,We had a long lay over at Incheon Airport and we took the Express train to Seoul station so we could visit Sungnyemun Gate and Namdaemun Market. It was very easy and much more fun than sitting in the airport for seven hours.
255,5.0,Totally a must go for all kinds of shopping. I don't know when it closes though because I got there at 4ish and some of the shops where closing so look that up ahead of time. Good place for souvenirs or any other trinket. Try your hand at haggling for a better price.
256,3.0,"I went with my wife - she loved all the things that you could buy. It is something for the ladies, not so much the men, however it is nice to walk around (not for 4 hours though...). Most of it is the same stuff and to a male it all looks the same :PThere is a tourist information desk there and they will point you in the right direction for whatever you want to buy."
257,4.0,"A huge area of shops and eateries. There are many street access into this market and the nearest subway station is Hoehyeon Station, exits 5, 6 and 7. Kalguksu Alley is at Gate 6 of the market and can be reached via exit 5 of Hoehyeon Station. Do note that souvenirs may not be as cheap as other places."
258,5.0,"Spent a few hours wandering around here during our visit. Lots of stalls to browse through. Don't forget to wander down the narrower alleys and check out sometimes the stores downs stairs. If you get tired you can always stop and have tea, coffee or try out the food on offer before wandering off again. Much is what you will find at home but there seems to be something different for all tastes. It's not too far from the subway and easy to reach."
259,5.0,"A paradise for cheap shopping! Forget about high end brands and trendy thins, here you will find useful and cheap stuff and decent prices.If you are into street food, this is also a great place to go. Even that you won't eat nor shopping, worth a visit to understand the culture behind the locals of Seoul."
260,5.0,Namendam Market is wonderful.  Lots of stores and restaurants with plenty of space to walk around.  Stop at the information booth to get a map.
261,5.0,A must see experience for the first time Korea visitors. I bought a honey - nut candy and the way they make it s amazing.
262,4.0,"I love Korean markets and this one did not disappoint. Knowing that it is the oldest market in Korea added to the experience. As usual, great photo and video opportunities were everywhere. It was a perfect place for people watching as well when we could find a spot to hang out and not be in the way of the shoppers. The stall owners were all very friendly. The highlight was our lunch and the included photos are from our lunch spot. It was down an alley with several little restaurants lining both sides. There was a large bowl of kimchi on the table and it doesn't get any better than all you can eat kimchi. Bring your own napkins."
263,4.0,"Once I discovered how good the street food was in Seoul, that's all we ate.  The market itself is good if shopping is your thing, but I preferred sampling all the different foods.  All very tasty & all very cheap!"
264,1.0,"The businessmen there is so demanding, forcing you to buy after you try to haggle the price. And for the same stuff, it is cheaper in myeng dong."
265,3.0,"I went to Namdaemun after a nice walk in Myeongdong, it was nice to see a totally different shopping experience, lots of clothing, bags, shoes, and home needs, and bargain is acceptable for some products on the streets."
266,5.0,"Its a great place to buy souvenirs, socks with you Kpop bands or Kdrama actors, the street food is quite expensive..we spent 70.000 won and did not eat much more that a regular restaurant where a Sangyopsal will cost you around 12.000 Won including the alcohol beverages, but you must paid it a visit if you go to Seoul. Where else are you gonna get cute socks for just a buck?"
267,4.0,"One of the largest markets I have been to. Clean tidy well set out. Also lots of little ""shops"" running off the market street. You can get anything you want here. Some bartering. No hassles no one grabbing you or berating you to buy. Street food available, hygiene standard was high. Also some department stores within the market. The limousine bus from the airport has a stop and pickup area by the market. Not far to walk to Lott store and Shingle store. Very handy to metros and underground shopping."
268,4.0,"Namdaemun market is the place to go if you want to purchase Korean souvenirs e.g. magnets, Korean money bag, Korean snacks. Korean snacks like the famous chocolate brownie are abundant and cheaper, if buy in bulk. There's also shops selling toys, jewelry and art work materials. Prices of cosmetic is the same as Myeongdong, but here in Namdaemun, they will give more free samples. There is a tourist information booth at the market, where you can ask for a free map, which tells you which area of the market sells what goods. At the market, one can also get a good view of the N Seoul Tower."
269,4.0,"Surely something for everyone within this close net series of streets. From fruit and veg, fish, meat. clothes to souvenirs it was a bustling hive of activity. Bought some trousers and a local wood carving. Negotiated both for a lower price which seemed quite acceptable. If you want to try clothes on to check the fit, be prepared for a very makeshift changing room to ""appear"" ... made from packing boxes!"
270,5.0,"Wandering through the mazes of alleyways, amongst mainly locals, finding everything from artwork to antiques, food to foot ware, literally hundreds of storekeepers packed into one tiny shopping metropolis.  A fabulous place to find the unusual gift or souvenir.  One could spend hours fossicking through handbags, clothes, shoes, scarves, you name it - it was all there.   Slightly easy to get lost amongst the myriad of alleys or to lose one's sense of direction within them.  Overall - fabulous!"
271,4.0,"We went on a Saturday lunchtime after completing the Namsun Circuit. We only ate from the stand up stalls, not the sit down ones and most items were priced (unlike what some of the reviews have said on here). Typically items will cost either W1000 or W2000. After doing the walk it was welcome to get hot, tasty and filling food. No, it won't win any awards and it's not as good as e.g. Thailand (and pretty much all of it is fried) but for a relatively cheap lunch outdoors I thought it was quite good. Compared to market eating in the rest of korea it's at the better end of what we've tried, which is why I've given it a 4.We didn't buy anything else - most of the clothes looked like cheap tat."
272,5.0,"One of our favorite places to visit.  Great souvenirs, food alleys, clothing, cute umbrellas, knockoff designer jewels (like Chanel), shoes, socks, hats....you name it, you can find it.  Vendors are set up on the streets and there are many buildings to wander through.  Prices are very good and often you can bargain for a lower price.  Many locals shop here so it has to be a good place! You will enjoy your visit!"
273,4.0,"We had a 12 hour layover at Incheon so we took the high speed rail to Seoul Station and asked the cab driver to bring us to ""where the locals shop."" The vendors can be a bit pushy but overall we had a good time and got some interesting souvenirs. Also, the people in Seoul were very friendly to us which was nice."
274,4.0,"A lot of the traditional Korean market places have given way to supermarket chains owned by the monstrous Korean chaebol‚Äôs (south Korean business conglomerates) like Samsung or LG. Luckily, a few of the traditional market places still survive and thrive to this day. One such traditional market place is Namdaemun Market.The market is located next to Namdaemun, the ""Great South Gate"", which was the main southern gate to the old city. It is the oldest and largest market in Korea. It is also right next to Hoehyeon station (line 4). Exits 5 and 6 are practically in the market. Tips-Be prepared to haggle on the price.-Bring cash.-Don't visit on a Sunday or a public holiday. Many of the stores will be closed.-Wear good walking shoes. There is nowhere to sit and rest. -Every store has a number above it, like a street address. It makes finding your favourite store easier in future.

275,5.0,loved this area...lots of street foods to choose from. Shopping on every alley from fruits to clothes... i loved the food the most..
276,3.0,"After visiting Myeongdong, the Namdaemun Market is very low key and quite a bit smaller.  It also has more of a local flavor and few high end retailers.  Like Myeongdong, there's a steet version and an underground area.  The outside section at Namdaemun seems to have a lot of local food type eateries.Because it was pouring rain, we spent some time in the underground shopping area.  I was surprised to see several optical stores.  Some had reading glasses for sale for 20,000 won and others for as little as 7000 won.And tie stores!.  I've never seen a shop that sells nothing but ties, tie clips, and cuff links.  You'll find women's clothing stores, as well as men's, children's shops and housewares retailers, cosmetics/skin care retailers, luggage, and on and on.  Only one storekeeper glommed onto us to try to pressure sell when we were browsing.    My favorite was shoes.  In one shop I liked probably ten fabulous pair of funky, glittery shoes - over-the-top styles I haven't seen in the US.  I could have bought a pair of black boots with a large crystal cat on the side - would have looked great on the motorcycle, but they didn't have my size.  Some shoes were sale priced at 20000 won or less (approx $20 US).   Prices in general seemed to be lower than the Myeongdong area.Namdaemun underground wasn't very busy, but that might be because few were venturing out in the rain.  If you're looking for inexpensive, you might want to check this out."
277,4.0,"Namdaemun market is labyrinth of shops interconnected by little lanes and roads (generally closed to traffic) with the roads and lanes hosting various stalls. You will be jostling for space with locals looking for a bargain, tourists and shop/stall keepers creating a lively environment. Sample the local foods at very reasonable prices and check out what's on sale - knock off clothes and bags, utensils etc. Most things on sale aren't labelled. If you're not happy with the price quoted, you can ask for a discount or just move on. This market is less than 10 minutes walk from Myeongdong. By comparison, things for sale in Namdaemun are not as ""up market"" as Myeongdong."
278,3.0,Went there twice and did not manage to find the things I wanted to buy as the shop owners were busy packing to close shop even at 4pm ish. The booths on the main roads were selling around the same things and I notice women's wear tend to be for the 40-50s+
279,4.0,This place is amazing. There is vast amounts of stalls selling very cheap clothes and food. The best time to visit is in the evening where the market is buzzing with lots of people.
280,5.0,"The market is said to date back to 1400s, though I guess the stalls have changed since. Still it's a fascinating place to walk through and snack at. Oh yeah, you can also buy cheap stuff there."
281,4.0,"Great place to go and see and shop like a Korean. Big place with a lot of Chinese made products and mix of Korean produce too. Korean Ginseng shops are plenty here but hard to decipher which are the good quality ones and which are just plain infused-tea. Korean ginseng can be very expensive and you might not know what you end up paying for!Had really nice seafood pancake in a small shop toward the Shinsagae end of the market - you will see a lady frying pancakes outside and the aroma is so appetising! 10,000 won for a pancake but was worth the money. Have it with the Cass beer - amazing pair! Good place to shop for Korean chopsticks and kitchenware - various quality and grade with the titanium chopsticks getting quite expensive at close to US$20 for 10. Can bargain and we got ours for US$16 - good luck!"
282,4.0,"Lots of shopping at Nandaemum market.  Great place to see the daily life's of locals unfold as I arrived early in the morning.  I did what the locals did. I ate breakfast at one of the many noodle shops. I had a bowl of noodle , a bowl of red bean rice and seaweed.  It was fresh and hot. Tons of stores selling everyday ware, veggies, shoes etc. Definitely a fun way to experience the local's life."
283,3.0,"We visited the Namdaemun market during a weekend and it was crowded and busy just as we had thought it would be. I found some tacky souvenirs and few good mementoes to bring back but by and large it is not a place where you can find good quality stuff. There are lots of fridge magnets and nail cutters and purses and small bric-a-bracs that you can carry back for friends and family since they all come in sets. But, if you want something that is unique then you must scout around Insadong to find it."
284,4.0,This place is a lot of fun! Locals and tourists alike come here. Good prices (but not sure about the quality though). You are not pestered here which is very nice.
285,4.0,"We went to Namdaemun Market and entered at Entrance 4. We immediately found a building called Simak. This was several floors  selling clothes, accessories, etc. The clothes were very well made and cheaper than the UK. In the street were lots of shops and stalls selling various items. It is well worth a visit."
286,5.0,"This is a great place to shop! You will find clothes, fashion, jewelry, cameras, sports stuff, army stuff, souvenirs, home-ware, food stuff, and the list goes on and on. Do not fear if you get lost (like we did) as there are ""tourist police"" stationed around the market to help you get your bearings and find your way. When we were confused where we were, we approached one of them and she whipped up a map of the market, marked where we were and the direction we were heading, and we were on our way again! There are also things to eat as well.My wife and I walked into a building where it was all filled with workers making costume jewelry. It was a huge place. You will also be able to find souvenirs and Korean food stuff that you can buy as gifts of your trip. Many tour groups also make a stop at this market, so expect it to be crowded."
287,4.0,"Went here after visiting the Sungyemun Gate. You can access it from the gate via underpass & that is the safest way to get there as crossing the road could be tricky. Usual fair of clothes, food & appliances. I would time it either early morning or late arvo/evening as when we were there in September the day was hot (28 Deg C) & the heat made conditions a bit uncomfortable. Use the subway line 1 & get off at Seoul Station & walk up towards the gate. No black market (knock off goods thou)"
288,2.0,It's just a market full of people selling fake brands clothes of terrible quality. No deals there. By the way you can enjoy some nice fried food. No special artisans neither manufacture.
289,3.0,"this market is pretty expansive, and moves between outdoor street sellers and indoor air conditioned market stalls.  goods on sale range from curios and tourist trinkets, shops selling leather jackets, shops selling only umbrellas or hats, to pyjamas and shirts and toys and fake bags. the mix is very eclectic but not very high quality. its good to meander through and excellent for people watching."
290,4.0,"Namdaemun street market offers a large selection of Korean gifts, food, clothes and around 10 shops that sell reputable camera and camera gears. Namdaemun is also next to Shinsagae for top class brand names as well as walking distance to Myeongdong cosmetic shops. A must visit if you are into Korean street food, souvenirs and cameras."
291,5.0,"Great local market. We've been to lots in Asia, and this is by far the cleanest and safest! My husband and I got new glasses - my eyes tested, husband's off his prescription, done in half an hour. Picked up some hot stone bowls so we can enjoy bibimbap at home.Delicious street food. A fried fritter thing with veggies - a must have. Ventured down the side alleys and stopped in for some yummy bulgogi and seriously hot Kim chi! Topped it all off with a large slice of fresh, sweet watermelon.All in all, a good couple of hours. Highly recommend stopping in here."
292,5.0,"This is such a fun marketplace filled with all kinds of shopping opportunities. You will find some neat items and lots of accessory shops. I had so much fun walking around and shopping here. They sell a lot of interesting clothes, jewelry, korean souvenirs, food, etc. You must stop by Namdaemun for some interesting finds. Very affordable items for all budgets."
293,4.0,"Loved walking through these markets. You can quite easily get lost in there. So many different roads and walkways to go down. The street food is great and the people are super friendly. It's really cheap and you can get anything you want from shoes, clothes, food, cutlery, crockery, nick nack's, linens. EVERYTHING! No one shouts at you to buy there things and negotiating was petty easily, though its so cheap you don't really need to."
294,4.0,"Mostly I go to Namdaemun to buy souvenirs and craft items. If you want hassle-free experience, Insadong has things nicely laid out, but if you want low price and more whole-sale experience, go to Namdaemun. There are a lot of shops that face the street which are easily reacheable, but those places are not the ones to go to. Make sure to go into the buildings where shops are all close together and mostly doing wholesale. But, usually the tea sets, souvenirs, and artisan items can be bought non-whole sale. Be sure to go early as they start closing in the afternoon.If you want to get accessories, expect to buy in bulk. For clothing...do some research ahead to find which building to go into. They have a website that lists types of stores.If you want textile or traditional clothing, I would seek out Dongdaemun market."
