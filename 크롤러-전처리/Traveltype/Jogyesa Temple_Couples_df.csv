0,5.0,Jogyesa Temple is an oasis against the chaos of Seoul's bustling streets.Near Insadong this temple is the center of Korean Buddhism. Temple garden is very pretty and colorful.Come to Jogyesa temple and get a taste of monastic life in the city center!!!!Jogyesa Temple is open daily and admission is free.
1,5.0,The temple was absolutely stunning. We visited it during the afternoon and then again in the evening to see the lights lit up. It took our breath away and the photos really can’t do it justice!
2,5.0,We went to the Jogyesa Temple and were glad we visited.  The lotus flowers all over were lovely and the entire temple area was very colorful.  It was interesting to see the active worship going on.
3,5.0,"I haven't seen a temple quite like this one before. The multi-colored lanterns strung up in the skyline are mesmerizing. You'll find yourself staring up there, unable to stop yourself. The temples are beautifully painted and decorated. A must-see in the Insadong area. However, be respectful. We went on a Sunday morning and it was filled with local worshipers. Please treat their beliefs and ceremonies with respect and do not try to pose in front of their statues as they're trying to pray (which we saw on more than one occasion in our brief time there) Also, refrain from entering the main temple as a ceremony is going on. It's allowed, but how would you feel if someone entered your church in the middle of worship, loudly, and began taking pictures everywhere?"
4,5.0,"A lovely, serene temple in the midst of Seoul with three giant Buddha statues inside and a 10-story stupa in which is enshined a relic of Buddha which was transported to Korean in 1913 by a Sri Lankan monk."
5,5.0,"Preparing for Buddha birthday celebrations meant that the temple was covered in coloured lanterns and there were ladies pracising their dance in costume, absolutely stunning!"
6,5.0,"Fortunately we were here early May when they celebrated the Buddha’s birthday. Lighted lanterns strung all over the street and at the temple. Three Buddha’s each having a different function. There is no organized tour as far as I could tell. The first ever post office in Korea is also located on the same grounds. Tip:  If you want to really get a lot out of touring South Korea hire a private tour guide from VIP Travel (Susan). We had the concierge from the hotel organize or for us. Car and guide 500k Won plus fees. We really developed an understanding for their culture this way and saw a lot with the car whisking us around town. No more than 6 hours is my suggestion. She also took us to a local place for lunch. Again, a cultural experience."
7,5.0,It was worthwhile visiting to see this important temple and our visit was enhanced by the various displays of lanterns and offerings for Buddha’s birthday. But it was more moving still to see the many faithful showing personal devotion in their prayers
8,5.0,"On our trip around South Korea with my husband we visited many temples and so we almost didn't visit this one- but I am so glad we did.On our last night we walked around the area and found ourselves so close we thought we should pop in. It is beautiful. An incredibly tranquil, peaceful place in the heart of Seoul. We visited quite late at night & would highly recommend.(sorry- we visited the year before but I really wanted to let everyone know that it is worth a visit for sure!)"
9,4.0,The Jogysea Temple is a very beautiful and peaceful place. If you are in the area take the time to visit here.
10,5.0,"We loved this temple. It happened to be a great time to visit during Buddha birthday celebration, they have a tour and it is just an overall peaceful place."
11,4.0,"We have mixed feelings after visiting this temple. is beautiful, in a typically Korean style, kept in a modest style, but ... she does not fit there! around huge skyscrapers, busy city and the sound of this modern Korea! There is a lack of peace and quiet to appreciate this place"
12,2.0,We went there in the morning.is a small temple we were there about 20mins.good for photos.and a message on paper and hang them up on part of the tenple for luck and make a donation.not like the tenples in thailand but ok.
13,3.0,Enjoyed our visit to this temple and was also close to Insa Dong and Gyeongbokgung Palace. Free to enter and look around. Recommended time 30 minutes.
14,5.0,went late October as a side trip before visiting Insadong on a Sunday afternoon.  the temple is a short distance from Anguk Station and Insadong with no entrance fees. this was a very worthwhile 1 hour stroll among the dazzling mum displays around the clean manicured grounds. the flowers were in full bloom and the temple structures are equally colorful.  the visitors were quiet and respectful of this peaceful environment.  this is a good attraction if you are in the Insadong area.
15,5.0,"Visited the temple during prayer so didn't go inside out of respect, but the gardens around the outside are beautiful. The flowers had such a lovely smell, and the buildings are traditional and oozing history."
16,3.0,Walking distance from City Hall if you are okay to take a slow stroll.  On the way you will see a lot of shops selling ornaments and the place was really beautifully decorated.
17,5.0,Beautiful and vibrant temple.2 stalls in the temple that sells very simple local delights too. Good to visit if you need a peaceful and yet centralised place
18,4.0,"The Jogyesa Temple is must a visit when is Seoul. The temple with a great history, with gardens and the number small buddhas arranged within the plant life Go first to see the  main atrraction of the three large gold buddhas. Allow enough time to soak in the atmosphere and feel the vibration of the Temple and Buddhas .This is a busy temple, so is a great place to observe people and appreciate some wonderul Korean temple architechture at the same time."
19,5.0,"We just loved the ambience and appearance of this lovely temple and surroundings. Meticulously maintained and obviously lovingly attended to, this temple was a delight to explore. Colour abounds with flowers, and sculptured tree decorations. Wonderful Buddha statues to see. This is an active temple for Followers to pray, and a great place to visit and enjoy."

21,5.0,"The Jogyesa Temple is definitely worth a look in if you are nearby. It's a fully functioning temple with a great history, with a number of differnt components to explore. Start with the grounds, admiring the gardens and the number small buddhas arranged within the plant life. Then head to the back of the complex to appreciate some of the older parts of the temple before heading to the main atrraction of the three large gold buddhas. This is a busy temple, so is a great place to observe people and appreciate some wonderul Korean temple architechture at the same time."
22,4.0,"This was a little break from shopping in Insadong, nice Temple with a path constructed from lotus plants in large pots when we were there. Didnt go in as people were using the temple for what it was designed for, and didnt want to impose. Looked in through windows and impressed by the statues. Like how old and new can live side by side in Seoul."
23,5.0,"You will never imagine how a modern city and history got together in this city, you can walk anywhere, you feel safe and peace in Seoul."
24,5.0,It is not so big but is really cool to be there. I went at the ceremony time and it was really cool to see. I recommend it
25,5.0,"It is a small, but an important temple for the believers and for the tourists to experience the atmosphere"
26,5.0,We visited in mid-April and the courtyard was already being decorated with colored lanterns for Buddha's birthday in May. We walked around taking pictures and were able to catch a glimpse of the magnificent golden statues inside the temple. It was beautiful!
27,3.0,Jogyesa is not as beautiful as Bongeunsa or other temples we have seen in SK but it's perhaps the most accessible - a short walk from Insadong. There was scaffolding around the main building when we visited the first time but it was removed when we walked past at the end of the trip. An oasis of calm in the frenetic city. There is an impressive pagoda in the courtyard and the Buddha statues in the prayer hall are pretty stunning. Worth a visit if in the area.
28,4.0,Gorgeous buddhist temple in the heart of the city. The 3 buddha statues inside temple are totally worth seeing. Loved the energy of the place. Must visit when you are in seoul!
29,5.0,The Buddhist temples here were all roofed with brightly coloured lanterns which made for quite a display.  Each one was the mark of a family donation and wishes for the future and then there were some areas with plain white lanterns which were prayers for the dead.  The buildings were brightly painted and the whole site was quite spectacular.  Admission was free and photos were allowed as long as you didn't take them in the shrine itself. There was a bus stop just outside so the site is easy to get to.
30,5.0,It’s beautiful temple I love to visit temple it’s feel so special and wonderful place to relax and see art you can spend hours here to walk around and see a lot of thing and rest if you want too !  Will come back to visit!
31,4.0,Visit the Buddhist temple whilst watching the lantern festival of 2018.  Don’t forget to take your shoes off before entering.
32,4.0,"The grounds of the temple aren’t terribly exciting accept for during the lantern festival. At this time it is absolutely beautiful, especially at night all lit up. The interior of the temple is impressive and opulent and definitely worth a visit."
33,4.0,"Just over 1 week until Buddha’s birthday celebration.   100s of colorful lanterns.   If you want to add your note on to a lantern, it will cost you 30,000krw.   500 year old tree in front of temple."
34,4.0,When we were there today they were only days away from the Buddha Birthday celebrations so the place was looking really good.Hundreds of lanterns and more being madeThe outside was beautifully decoratedRegrettably when there we couldn't see inside because it was packed with worshippers but then that's what it's there for
35,4.0,We loved the small grounds of this temple.  The colours were amazing and there was an extremely serene atmosphere here.  Free to wonder around but some areas are restricted if services are happening.
36,5.0,"Beautiful temple in the middle of Seoul. We went in October when there was some type of flower festival and they had huge ""sculptures"" made of flowers. It was so colorful and impressive. I loved this spot!"
37,3.0,"I’ve been to various Buddhist temples in Asia, this one was very small and not much to see. The main hall for prayer is really the only building. There are 2 other buildings but not much. The store had bags of rice for an offering. Maybe it was the day of my visit but not much was happening. Done in less than 1 hour"
38,4.0,"Jogyesa Temple is close to Insadong, about 5 mins walking distance.  The temple is not big.  The garden of temple is the nicest part.  There are trees and lots of flowers with various colors. You can see the high-rise building around the temple, which makes an interesting contrast.The temple itself is built with traditional Korean building / temple style.  The ceiling and roof of the temple are painted with bright red and green color with a lot of flower design.  You can find these designs in a lot of old temples and palace buildings. There are a few buddha statues inside the temple.  People burn incense and worship there.  You have to take off your shoes if you want to go into the temple and taking photo inside the temple is not allowed.  We took a few pictures of the interior of temple  from outside the temple and it was ok. There is a book store / souvenir shop and a washroom in the temple garden.  We spent about 45 mins there then we strolled to Insadong. Along the street where the temple is, there are lots of stores selling temple wear for monks and nuns, restaurants for vegetarians.  If you go to Insadong, you can spend an hour in the temple and the surround area to experience their religious atmosphere."
39,5.0,"Very beautiful temple. It is located walking distance from the Gyeongbokgung Palace, so one can walk there. Highly recommended."
40,5.0,"Our daughter lives just south of Seoul and we visited her last summer.  First I was in awe of the mandala of Lotus flowers.  But as I stepped up to see the 3 gold Buddhas, I was speechless.  I must have stood there for 30 minutes. My husband I went inside and chanted/prayed/meditated with those inside.  I'll never forget this experience.  I've seen many Buddhist temples in different countries, but this one so resonated with me.  Such spirit it has.  Visit the gift shop too for some wonderful items.  I bought a CD of one of the Monks chanting the same chant we heard and I play it in my yoga classes.  Everyone loves it."
41,5.0,This is a beautiful working and living temple complex very close to Insadong and absolutely a must-visit for anyone interested in Buddism. Not recommended for those expecting a themepark experience. This is a place for respectful quiet and somewhere to appreciate the still deeply held philosophical beliefs of many Koreans.
42,5.0,"If you get tired of the shopping at Insadong and palace sightseeing, this temple is a nice little respite to stop and have a rest. Spacious peaceful yard which we were welcome to sit in, perhaps you will be lucky to chance upon the prayers and chants. You can take photographs of the building and garden landscape but no photographs of the inside. One nice Korean lady invited us to go into the temple where the prayers are happening in what I assume to be the main hall so it must be okay to go in and sit respectfully, but best to double check if you really want to go in."
43,5.0,"Beautiful temple buildings, nicely painted decoration and plants. In October-November Chrysanthemun festival. In the area also a Memorial hall for the history and culture for Korean Buddhism"
44,3.0,Excellent opportunity to see normal koreans praying and carrying out buddhist rituals in the center of the city
45,5.0,"It was surprising to find such a temple in the middle of Seoul, it was set back from the road and not so easy to see at first, but well worth the effort. The temple was very busy at the weekend with worshippers, with only a few of us tourists! The place comprised of the temple itself plus what seemed to be a separate building for study on the ground floor (with the 2nd floor being inaccessible). Although not a lot to see, what is there is well worth the trip, and so convenient to reach. We visited the temple after visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace (within walking distance of this)."
46,4.0,We had a great spiritual experience here. The monks and hundreds of local Buddhists read the praying in both Sanskrit and sometimes Korean. The red and green theme decoration on the wooden structure is beautiful. The lovely lotus pots in front are so nice and aromatic. I highly recommend this temple in Seoul.
47,5.0,"Not only did I feel privileged to have been able to see this magnificent temple, I was also able to be inside and participate in a ceremony. I felt in awe of the warmth people offered us to be with them and to join them in prayer. We were offered cushions by many who welcomed us inside. This exquisite site should be in everyone's list of things to do in Seoul. We happened to be there for the celebration of Buddah's birthday and we're invited to join a large group of volunteers, all Korean locals, to design the paper lanterns to be used in the celebrations the following day. My friend and I were really moved by this amazing experience. So beautiful!"
48,5.0,"This temple hidden in the city is a little tough to find. Once we got there we were mesmerized by all of the beautiful colors of the lanterns that create a canopy over the grounds. The Buddhas themselves are beautiful. In contrast to temples we had been to in Japan, there aren't too many tourists, and you can enjoy the sights without too many people around fighting for the perfect picture."
49,4.0,I set out to find this temple while walking in Seoul. It is somewhat hidden and out of the way. It is not particularly large as compared to many temples in Thailand. I arrived during a prayer service which was very well attended. There is less economic activity on the grounds of the temple than what you would find in Thailand also. It is interesting and worth the walk but don't expect it to be the same as some other countries.
50,5.0,"Absolutely beautiful,soo colourful and rows of Lillie's in bloom ,stunning features ,and you can see the huge gold Buddah inside the magnificent temple ,great place for pics ,feels soo calming here within the sights of huge skyscrapers ,and just around the corner great shopping area ,selling anything and everything such a fab place to visit."
51,5.0,"Jogyesa Temple, the bastion of Korean Zen Buddhism, is an important landmark in Seoul, attracting many visitors from all over the world. In late Spring every year, this temple is decorated with sea of beautiful lanterns. As the highlight of 3-day festival celebrating Buddha's birthday, impressive Lotus Lantern Parade unfolds along Jongno Street ending at Jogyesa Temple. If you visit the temple in late April, you will be immersed in the spectacle of thousands of beautiful lanterns floating in the air surrounding the temple. Since the temple is not far from Insadong's main shopping street, visitors can combine their visit to Insadong with visit to Jogyesa Temple."
52,5.0,A peacefull place near Insadong ... the golden Buddhas are impressive. Last year I was there during the festival for Budha's birthday and there were so many bright lanterns all aroung the temple. Nice templs restaurant on the other side of the street
53,4.0,"An important Buddhist temple which attracts worshippers near and far, so you need to be respectful. Bright colourful exterior with 3 dominate status inside. In the heart of Insadong so easy to combine with our place to visit nearby.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
54,5.0,"Jogyesa temple is open to everyone and a lovely place to meditate. You can enter the temple but remember to remove your shoes and respect the other people who are there to pray. It appears that it is better to wear socks so you aren't walking barefoot in the temple. Usually, there are Buddhists outside the temple as well (as least in warm weather). You should not take pictures inside the temple. There is are a restaurant and a number of Buddhist supply stores that are very interesting to experience. If you are there in May during Buddha's birthday celebrations, you will be treated to a beautiful lantern display."
55,5.0,"My girlfriend and I went to Jogyesa and wanted to try the temple stay at the best temple in Korea, but then decided not to due to time constraint, because we also went to Nami Island and other fun places in Taehan Minguk.Established back in 1395 during the Joseon dynasty, it changed its name back to Jogyesa Temple after the Japanese were defeated in World War II.Inside the main building, there are three Golden Buddhas, I assume made of pure gold because they are very shiny, and people were either prostrating, reading sutras, or just meditating on their mats.Surrounding the three Golden Buddhas, is the most famous Buddhist Sutra, originally in Chinese Characters, but now also available in Korean language: The Great Diamond Sutra, translated by Kumarajiva, an Indian who also know the Chinese language better than most Chinese Monks.We spent around 2 hours, and recited the Diamond Sutra in Chinese, including the ending Mantra, which is not commonly seen in the Mandarin version.Overall, the temple is amazing, and Buddhist Monks ring the bell and chant sutras that calm the mind every hour, and there is a nice store that sells many books and Buddhist itineraries, and I happily bought a copy of the Prajnaparamita Heart Sutra in Korean.Aje Aje Para Aje Para Sam Aje Boddhi Satvaha ^_^"
56,5.0,We happened to be in Seoul in May so the temple was adorned with colorful lanterns to celebrate the Buddha's birthday.  It was beautiful and we were able to hear the monks chanting. Definitely worth a visit. Plus the nearby shopping area of Insa-dong is next too it so you can shop for souvenirs too!
57,4.0,A nice Budha temple in the center of th city very coulorfull outside and very impressive inside with lots of people.
58,5.0,They were setting up celebrations for Buddha's birthday and there were thousands of lanterns everywhere. It was an incredible sight to see and the volunteers working there were incredibly helpful and friendly.
59,4.0,This is a colorful and interesting place near the palaces and Insadong. If you can arrive during a Buddhist service it is even more impressive.
60,5.0,We were in Insadong and the temple isn't that far away. It was a day of worship with the monks chanting which was a huge highlight. The temple was getting ready for Buddhas birthday. Just wonderful being there!!
61,5.0,"We are a couple in our 30s from Florida, USA. We enjoyed visiting this temple. The grounds are very big and there is no admission fee to enjoy the scenery and service. We stayed at Lotte City Hotel Myeongdong and it was walking distance to this location. In fact, we walked everywhere."
62,3.0,Low key sight which was quieter in the evening but attractively light with lanterns. Lots of atmosphere. Worth 20-30 mins.
63,5.0,"During our city tour this was one of the stops, and thank you!  When we entered we found the place full of worshippers praying for the peace of the country.  We were offered free tea and encouraged to walk around at our leisure.  There is a monument which is reputed to contain a fragment of `Buddha's remains, and The statuary is awe-inspiring.  This is a very worthwhile stop if you want to take a little time to center yourself."
64,5.0,Very nice Temple in city center. Very colorful around it and surrounding. Our guide was very informative about the temple.
65,4.0,Religion is very important to Koreans. Korean culture and respect for beliefs is interesting if you visit the place
66,5.0,"I really enjoyed this place, it's beautiful from inside out. You can enter in, however please make sure you take your shoes off, and that you bow once on entry and once on exit. As people pray here, recording and photo is not allowed. These are the biggest indoor stages of 5 m and are really beautiful to look at. We came and sat on the cushion for 10 minutes soaking the atmosphere, recommend to visit when you are in Seoul."
67,3.0,"We were specifically looking for this temple, while we were walking there found this and realized it was one and the same. Anyway if you are around the area you should go, but not something to go out of your way for. Found the single most cutest Buddha statue ever though!"
68,5.0,Beautiful and well cared for temple in the middle of Seoul. Highly recommend stopping in. It is a spot of tranquility amongst the towering sky scrapers.
69,5.0,The beautiful Jogyesa in the hart of downtown Seoul is e beautiful and peaceful complex. I was a little bit shy to get inside the temple as locals were praying and I did not want to disrupt but enjoyed seeing it.
70,4.0,"A lovely, active temple for those in-town.  Many were praying there, and visitors were welcome as long as they took off their shoes.  There are two prayer options on the site and both are worth checking out.  Lovely roof decoration and the juxtaposition of old and new makes for a great photo."
71,4.0,"1 of the few established Temple in Seoul it is easily accessible via Anguk station. Jogyesa Temple is the center of Zen Buddhism in Korea and the main temple of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism. The temple is at its present site since 1937.As we walked along the street around Jogyesa Temple we noticed the many Buddhist specialty shops selling related items like the prayer beads, Buddhist writings, calendars, incense, as well as souvenirs such as dolls and key chains.  We din buy any but find it so interesting…The first things you will notice at the temple are the lovely trees and the ‘explosion’ of the garden brilliant colours!. These baeksong trees in front of the Daeungjeon, the main temple building, are about 500 years old. One of them claimed to be above 20-meter high. The temple area has several buildings. The entrance has large pots with planted lotuses. The area is festooned/hung with lanterns which made for a wonderful sight too.The temple is spacious and crowded with worshippers.. There are three large, golden Buddha images inside the temple. A real good place for taking photos and just walk around. Appreciate the wonderful sight and sense of calmness (mind), where the bustling streets is just outside. Do look out for the Beomjongru (Brahma Bell Pavilion) is a colorful building, the The Chinese Scholar Tree and also the not to be missed The Ten Story Buddha Relic Stupa Definitely recommended to drop by.."
72,4.0,"On our way to the Jongmyo palace and old Seoul neighborhood, we saw this temple from the street and decided to stop. There was a ceremony with singing monks inside the temple and it was surrounded by flowers arranged around different shapes and statues and many plants everywhere in the garden. Two of the big statues covered in flowers and leaves had the shape of 2 dragons which were more than 10 feet tall. The monks celebrating the ceremony was playing a drum and singing and repeating a short prayer verse over and over in a mesmerizing way. Inside there are 3 big golden Buddha statues. No photos allowed inside like many other temples."
73,5.0,"This is a lovely Buddhist temple.  We were there in the midst of autumn festival.  Flowers were everywhere.  The place is very well maintained, and the guide at the Information was most helpful.  In the evening the temple is lighted up.  Opposite the temple, across the road is the Temple Stay organisation.  On the 5th floor there is a beautiful Temple Food Restaurant.  Well worth a meal there."
74,4.0,"I saw this place during some buddhist fest so it was all covered in many colours, people were praying and all this made this place magnificet. Its really unusual place. You should go there if you are around."
75,4.0,"A 2 minute walk from Insadong puts you at the main gate of this temple. Buddhism, having a long history in Korea, leave, like a bird in the sky, little physical trace of it's history. This is a bright reminder of what once was, and still is, though to a dramatically lesser degree ( Christianity has been winning the battle big time ).A typical temple, but a great visit due to it's accessibility. It is both lively and active, and offers a temple stay to boot."
76,4.0,"This temple in Insadong is the main temple of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism. The temple is at its present site since 1937.  There is a free foreigner tourist information centre with facility for a temple stay experience.  We were welcomed with free lotus tea and given a free stamp of the temple.  There is a white pin tree in the premises which is supposed to be very auspicious. There are three large, golden Buddha images inside the temple.  There is a temple food centre close by.  Very peaceful place, soothing to the nerves."
77,5.0,As our hotel was located close to the Temple we stumbled across it on our first night.   The place was beautifully lit with lanterns and has pretty grounds for photos.   People were in prayer so we were respectful and did not take photos inside.  Worth a trip to visit the Temple if you are near to Insadong
78,4.0,"Buddhist temple among others, you will find the old times atmosphere. Take care of other tourists who can visit at the same time."
79,4.0,A usual must see in all Seoul visits. The temple area has several buildings. The entrance has large pots with planted lotuses.  The plaza is festooned with lanterns to commemorate the dead or make wishes including many fish shaped ones.

81,4.0,This is a peaceful and beautiful temple located very near to Insadong. We passed by this temple while on our way to Insadong.

83,5.0,"A small temple area with some gardens and trees around it in the middle of the city. It will easily go unnoticed during daytime, but at night it is just a gorgeous view with all the colourful paper lanterns lit.Peaceful and not crowded at all when we visited it around 8 PM."
84,4.0,so many temples but this one is good with a large budda plus many smaller ones hot to walk around in the summer
85,5.0,The temple is a working temple so monks and ordinary people still come here. There is a large drum that the use at certain times which is how we found the place. There is a special white pine at the temple and there are shaded seating areas. They ask not to take photos of the inside of the temple. Its free to visit.
86,5.0,Another peaceful getaway in the middle of the city within walking distance of Insa Dong Art district.
87,5.0,"It s not a big temple, located in in the city but you can feel the peace. There is an information desk providing info in English. They are very helpful. They gave you free tea. It s a good idea to get into the hall to see the Buddha triad. You can take a photo without using flash. Please be quite as some people are sitting to mediate. The staff said to walk 3 rounds around the octagonal ten stored stupa which they kept relic, then make a wish. They believe your wish will come true. If you are hungry, walk across the road to try vegetarian food in Balwoo Gongyang on level 5. Staff will explain each dishes if u order set menu. Food are delicious!"
88,3.0,Beautiful architecture and gardens. While we were there we especially enjoyed the lotus blossoms which were in full bloom.
89,4.0,The temple is the center of Zen Buddhism in Korea. The locust and baeksong trees located outside are around 500 years old. The colorful lanterns are to celebrate Buddha's birthday.  Each represents a prayer and celebration wish by a local Korean. The temple is very active with the locals who offer their prayers and gifts to Buddha.
90,5.0,"Located conveniently in downtown Seoul, the Jogyesa Temple is both serene and colorful with the lanterns adorning the temple in a rainbow like manner. There was a calm and peace in this place which is to be relished."
91,4.0,"Unfortunately we seemed to be visiting on a day/time when the temple was in use by worshippers - nevertheless it was fascinating to see local people praying and following their religion. As the temple was in use we had to stand and observe respectfully from outside but the buddhas were amazing even from distance and as it's not too far from other attractions in the city, it was worth dropping by."
92,5.0,"We visited Jogyesa during Buddha's birthday celebration so the whole space had thousands of colorful lanterns hanging, creating this beautiful and peaceful canopy. I would really recommend stopping by. It's very close to Insadong"
93,5.0,"I only wanted to visit 1 temple and chose this one, it's very nice with 3 large buddhas inside and people actually use it. Outside is also very nice as is the area in general. Well worth a visit."
94,4.0,The temple is centrally located in Seoul and easily accessible. It was decorated for the Lantern festival and was so beautiful. Such a beautiful place. Ended there after the Lantern parade and saw dancing and singing. So great!
95,5.0,"I'm in Seoul around Budda's birthday (mid May), which makes it special as Temples such as this one have lanterns everywhere. I learnt from a local that people donate to the temple and then can have their name hanging from the lanterns. If your in the vicinity of this temple, have a walk past at night time when the lanterns are all lit up. It is just magical. There will also be people praying in the temple and it was wonderful to witness that culture."
96,5.0,"I visited the temple twice. The first time was during the week. It was peaceful and quiet. The main hall had people praying and reading sutras. I tried the temple's vegetarian lunch buffet restaurant across the street. It was fresh and tasty. The second time I went was for the Lotus Lantern Festival Parade. I signed up beforehand to be a parade participant. There were about 40 participants in the parade. We were given uniforms to change into. The temple was transformed into a sea of lanterns days before the parade. All participants met on Saturday afternoon. We were then given lanterns to be displayed. All of us migrated toward Jongno 5 ga close to Dongdaemum. When the parade started, all groups walked back to Jogyesa Temple. It was magical to see the temple lit up with all participants' lanterns on approach. The celebration continued in the central court area at the temple after the parade. The atmosphere was happy and full of life. Lotus Lantern Festival at the temple and the celebrations are all registered as intangible cultural property.  I highly recommend this activity. It was a memorable experience and a great way to see the temple."
97,5.0,"We visited about the time of the birthday of the Buddha. There were many people putting up decorations, bringing bottles of water, flowers and gifts to the temple. I was offered water while visiting. There is a museum next door for which there is no charge. It is possible to donate to both the temple and the museum."
98,3.0,"We stopped here on the first stop of our tour. Our driver was late picking us up ao we did not get much time to look around (time was offered, but our group was done and waiting for us). Didn't get the opportunity to read about the sight. Bongeunsa was definitely more picturesque."
99,4.0,"This is a beautiful temple in the midst of a bustling part of the city. Definitely worth taking the time to walk through it, especially if you are temple hopping!"
100,2.0,Visited on our way back from the Changgyyeonggung palace. Don't waste your time and skip. Far from spectacular; Ladders and ciment bags all over. Need I say more ?
101,5.0,"Beautiful temple located in the middle of the busy city, very peaceful and it has a great old trees. Easy to cover this in 30 to 45 mins."
102,4.0,"Not far from Infamous Insadong, lays the quiet peaceful temple, Jogyesa. The buddha are huge. Its a real treat, Good for couples. I don't recommend little kids go, they would disrupt the prayer."
103,4.0,We enjoyed our visit to this temple. We were welcomed at the door and even though people inside were worshipping we were permitted to take photographs. Well worth a visit.
104,3.0,"The temple itself is also nice but I think the garden around is way more interesting. Worth to stop here for 10-15, not much more."
105,5.0,Well decorated with flowers. Beautiful even its a small area but well decorated. This is even suitable for elderly since the area is small and concentrated.
106,4.0,"Autumn colors of Seoul include the colorful chrysanthemums that decorated Jogyesa Temple in Jongno, Seoul. It was a 10 minute walk from our Fraser Suites Hotel in Insadong. Get there via Jonggak Station, Subway line 1, exit 3.  It would be easy to stop by after a tour of the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Huge floral displays using various colors of chrysanthemums decorated the temple grounds. Jogyesa Temple is the chief temple of modern Korean Buddhism and people go there to pray. As visitors, it was interesting to see the beautiful architecture, temple areas and the special display of flowers and bonsai. The Chrysanthemum festival is held every year for about a month.  Nearby, the shops sold a variety of comfortable pajamas, calendars, tea ware, and Buddhist art."
107,5.0,"I pervasively lived in Korea for 10 years and never visited this temple.  In October 2015, I returned to Seoul for a visit and stopped by to have a look.  Wow!  It was impressive.  The grounds and garden are gorgeous.  It is a very busy and active working temple so there may be multiple activities happening.  This temple also participates in the Templestay Program.  I will take advantage of this the next time I visit Korea."
108,5.0,"Millions of flowers adorn the outside, the building itself is like a palace, just as beautiful. Very close to Insadong area to combine the 2. Make sure you take your shoes off if you go inside. Stunning."
109,5.0,"My visit to the temple was one of the highlights of an Asian tour.  We arrived on a Saturday during the chrysanthemum festival, so both the outside and inside of the temples were just exploding with color.  There was a worship service going on in multiple buildings with chanting and drumming.  The main sanctuary, with the three gold Buddhas was full to overflow capacity, and some worshipers were outside.  I was immediately greeted and offered a mat for kneeling.  I felt welcome and enjoyed participated in a portion of the service.  If you ever doubt the value of a lifetime of yoga and meditation, think no further than the older women of Korea, kneeling and standing and kneeling over and over again for an hour or more during worship.  It was beautiful to watch.The temple itself is spectacular - so colorful and well cared for.  A true community center.This is a must see in Seoul!"
110,5.0,"We have lived in Seoul for the past 4 months and we are lucky to be living behind this temple.  We go through the temple ground or past it at least 4 times a day and still find it breathtaking.  It a working temple and you can tell how important it is to the people who come here.  It is always has beautiful displays in the temple grounds, it really is a must see.  Its very close to 3 different subway stations so very easy to get to."
111,5.0,Came here as part of a tour.  This is a quiet reverent place.  Mostly women and a few men here to practice their Faith.
112,4.0,"Visited as a part of a City tour. Great location for Buddhists for praying and a beautiful Lily pond, and Lotus flowers.Great paper mache art and beaurtifully painted walls, ceilings in incredible detail. Stuff you just don't see now. It's a nice still feel and worth a visit.  A must while in Seoul."
113,5.0,"Stopped by here to visit this rather small temple complex just west of Insa-dong.Took a free guided tour from the ""foreigners'"" office and received a free postcard with commemorative stamp and refreshing lotus tea. Very informative tour by a friendly Buddhist.The lotus were just finishing their blooms, but must be lovely when in full bloom!Very peaceful place right in hectic Seoul.Temple Stay is available here for a reasonable price (meals included)."
114,5.0,One of the most beautiful places I've ever been. Really spectacular and breathtaking. You can also do a tea ceremony there (we decided not to) which would be a unique experience.
115,3.0,"If you're there during a festival or event (such as Buddha's birthday), the place is covered with amazing and colorful decorations.  Overall it's a nice, peaceful refuge in the middle of the city. Clean and well maintained, it's worth a walk around to check it out.But if you do have the chance to be there during a festival or event, then this rating would go up to a 4."
116,4.0,"This lovely temple is located very close to Insadong tourist vicinity. We were greeted with lots of colourful lanterns along the road leading to the temple as well as in the temple ground itself, apparently to celebrate Buddha's birthday in the month of May.There are huge Buddha statues in the main hall where you can see devotees are having their prayers inside. Visitors are invited to celebrate the Buddha's birthday by sponsoring the colourful lanterns for 30,000 won each which will be lit up every night, apparently for good wishes. We had our lunch at the temple's canteen which serve delicious and cheap vegetarian meal where you have to purchase the meal coupon @ 4000won at the souvenir reception at the front of the temple. Overall this is a nice temple to visit if you are in the Insadong vicinity and it's easy to reach as the lane which is directly opposite the famous Ssamziegil Mall directly leads to the temple. Just walk till the end of the lane and you will see the temple is just across the road on your right."
117,5.0,"This is a very charming temple with a lot of action. When we were there there was a prayer, many, many people and lots of colors. When you're walking through the city anyway this is a nice place to stop."
118,4.0,"If you are unsure about visiting a temple, make sure you stop by the information office which is located immediately to the left once you enter the entrance gates.  An elderly gentleman will explain what you need to do when entering the temple (prostrate and make a donation).  While we were informed, we still felt out of place and as if we were intruding.  Still worth a peak inside the temple to see the three large buddhas.  The lantern festival was taking place while we there so were able to take pictures of a canopy of colorful paper lanterns."
119,4.0,This is some what of a small temple by comparison with the other famous temples in Korea.  But around the time of Buddha's birthday (around May) there is a lantern festival on the street in front of the temple and the temple itself get decorated beautifully.
120,3.0,"This is a lovely Buddhist temple, neatly tucked away in Insadong.While the temple itself is not that big, the structure and its surrounding are rather charming.There are always loads of people inside the temple, most of which seems like tourists.Do try to keep quiet inside the temple, as the locals try to pray and will rarely tell you to hush, being oh-so-very-polite."
121,4.0,"This is a really nice temple located amongst a sea of modern buildings. The grounds are well kept and the shrines inside are jaw droppingly large.  They are by far the biggest we've seen in Korea so far.  It not our favorite temple, but it holds a solid place in the middle of the pack.  I actually enjoyed this place more than the neighboring palaces and Insadong.  We walked around the temple a few times just admiring the paint work up on the eves."
122,3.0,"Its really small but really beautiful and peacefu, is filled with vibrant lanterns..........................."
123,5.0,"Its really small but really beautiful and peaceful. The main building has 3 big golden buddhas that you have look at, I didn't go inside as others were praying however stood outside as could view in. There were paper fish hanging from the walk way which were really pretty. Felt a little like the locals were staring - however this didn't bother me!"
124,3.0,"Lovely little interlude in a day full of shopping and bustling activities, Jogyesa Temple was visited after a visit to nearby Insadong. While the grounds are small, the centerpiece of three large buddhist statutes and an active temple where folks were streaming in and out to observe their beliefs make it a very peaceful place in the hustle and bustle of the neighborhood. It doesn't seem to be geared towards tourists...which in a way, makes it more endearing and probably why it there weren't that many other tourists there. As someone who's just starting to get interested in Buddhism, it was one of the more memorable sights of Seoul."
125,4.0,"If you are not very familiar with Buddhism, you should definitely visit Jogyesa Temple. It's very interesting and touching. Unfortunately there are not many information about the place and Korean Buddhism available in English, so you need to do your research before visiting it."
126,3.0,"If you have never been to a Buddhist temple in Korea, this may be worth visiting.  However, the grounds are small and they were in the process of taking down a bunch of lanterns.  It's neat to check if you feel like walking from Insadong, but it shouldn't be made a central place to visit."
127,4.0,This temple is a short walk from Changdeokgung palace and is ideal for a quick visit. There was a chanting session going on while we were there which adds a nice touch to the Buddhist atmosphere. It was rather busy when we visited but still quite an interesting spot with its beautiful lanterns and Buddha statues.
128,4.0,"Impressive, especially if you arrive at around 9.30am when you can join the large congregation singing prayers with a monk. The three gold buddhas are imposing and there are some side temples to view as well. To easily understand the life of Buddha check out the beautiful simple paintings on the outside walls of the main temple"
129,5.0,"Take train to Anguk station exit 6,walk straight and turn left at main road. Beautiful coloured lanterns hanging everywhere and wonderful people who helped us to organize two prayer lanterns with our names and our daughters before we left.Temple inside is absolutely beautiful and anyone is welcome to enter."
130,5.0,An amazing temple!  I've never seen so much gold in one place!!   I very much liked that we got to visit a temple that is currently in use.  Being able to see ritual happening was special.
131,4.0,"This is the main temple of some Budhist order, and is quite colourful (though the side-temple is currently being re-constructed). The temple (and Budhism in Korea) was thoroughly de-Japanised, which led to some interesting differences. A temple information center is across the road from the temple."
132,4.0,"Very cute find walking along the street. Would prob not go out of my way for it, but it was a cute find on the way back to the hotel from the palace. There is a free English guide service."
133,3.0,"I finally got a chance to check out this temple and i had heard from alot of friends that it was well worth the time to check it out. Well, they were right.. it was really well kept and was nice to see the ancient temple. Soon after we arrived, many tour groups arrived from other countries and completely took over the whole area.. I was not happy at all and then the rest of the experience was ruined.. I felt like i was pushed from one area to another.. My advice is to chose a time to go when you can actually enjoy. I know that every place is trying to make money but..I will go back and check it out again when i can enjoy the whole area."
134,5.0,"I was going to Gyeongbokgung when we found this place. A really magical place! It had a lot of flowers and incredible figures. It stays between the Changdeokgung Palace and Gyeongbokgung. Why 5 stars:1)	No fee. In front of the street. Easy access;2)	Religious site. Different experience for westerns; 3)	Incredible flower decoration (4 stars without the flowers; I was luck, though); and4)	Amazing contrast between the serenity of place and the skyscrapers surrounding it."
135,5.0,"We stopped by early in the morning and pleased to find a Chrysanthemum Festival ongoing. Gorgeous flower displays and the Mum plant bonzais being displayed. The Temple has 3 giant gold Buddhas inside - you can peek in from the open windows/doors. Being respectful of the many worshipers, we did not take photos from there. We stopped back by the next Sunday as Service was going on, the courtyard was filled with people and the Buddhist priests/monks in their robes chanting was a powerful sight. I recommend a visit here, doesn't take long. Just a block west from Insadong."
136,5.0,Attended the temple twice on our visit to Seoul &it was good for me as there isn't to many places like this is my region of the world. Very quite & I spent over an hour there each time praying as I am learning the ways of Buddhism. Everyone is welcome & there is temple stays if you have the time to do so. Please remove your shoes if you want to enter & have reasonable skin covering & no hats.Sorry no photos as I don't think its the right thing to do. Enjoy the visit to the temple & reflect.
137,5.0,"Upon entering the Main Hall, one will be awed by the three huge Buddha statues. The positive energy and the religious atmosphere will immediately captured your mind such that you just want to enjoy the present moment and temporarily forget everything else. The Western Paradise Hall is a quiet and solemn place where devotees can be found meditating or reading. I went in and closed my eyes in meditation. It is so easy to focus on your in-and-out breaths after a few moments. Definitely a recommended place for Buddhists."
138,4.0,"Jogyesa Temple is the center of Zen Buddhism in Korea, and is famous for being located in the city. From the busy streets of Jongno, it is near Anguk Subway Station. In the courtyard there is 500 years old locust trees and baeksong trees in front  the main temple building.  The Daeungjeon building is a stately building built in 1938 with all the different colors painted on it with inside the large buddha statues. Just in front, there is also a seven stories stone pagoda.Good for a short visit."
139,5.0,A lovely temple that's well worth a visit and has an excellent & very friendly English speaking tourist office who'll be happy to explain everything to you
