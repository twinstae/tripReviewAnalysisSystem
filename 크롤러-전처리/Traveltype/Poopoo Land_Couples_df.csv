0,4.0,"If you are easily to offend this is not for you. This is good for weird photo opps and laughs or farts. They have little quizzes but not all are for English speakers. However, it was fun to experience bowel movement or different farts. It is a great indoor activity and for sure something to talk about at home."

It wasn't the cheapest place to visit but it was a bizarre and surreal experience which was full of laughs! It probably only takes around 10-15 minutes to get through but you can go through the course as many times as you like. We went in the evening and we had the place to ourselves."
2,3.0,"I was stoked (perhaps overly so) about visiting Poopoo Land. And at first glance, I was not disappointed. The entrance is graced by a large backside that you walk under, and the short flight of stairs inside plays various fart noises with each step. But this is geared toward kids who might not mind spending money on a 10 minute excursion through the alimentary canal. (Be aware, parts of the attraction are completely dark and a tight squeeze. Might be an issue if you are claustrophobic and/or afraid of the dark.)It's kind of cool to go down the ""colon"" slide at the end. You essentially become a piece of poop. LOLI'm not sorry I went, but wish I had known more what it would be like so I wouldn't have been as disappointed. It was just too brief for the money they charge, and largely populated by children."
3,5.0,It's cheap to get in. You don't stay long. But it's a laugh. Some funny photo opportunities. The slide at the end is a thrill. They don't offer any lockers and we had a backpack each which was a pain to carry around. Kids under 5 not allowed.
