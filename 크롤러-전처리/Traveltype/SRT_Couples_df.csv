0,1.0,"We booked a trip from Busan to Suseo on the SRT. About halfway through the trip, the train stopped due to a power outage. “Ten minutes” the conductor said. They continued to promise “ten minutes” for over three hours.Meanwhile, the tanks in the bathrooms filled up. Sinks starter overflowing with human waste. As I write this review, I am somewhere on cold, dark train with fecal matter all over the floor. Great system you’ve got, SRT!"
1,5.0,"I had a lot of questions between KTX and SRT before I went so I did some research everywhere.It turns out that I cannot purchase the tickets online as they don’t have an English page yet. We bought it as we arrived at Busan station. It’s the same station where the KTX train arrives so you depart from the same station too.The reason we chose SRT is because our accommodation back in Seoul is at Gangnam so it makes more sense to go back to Gangnam instead of Seoul Station. The SRT train is less busier and Suseo train station is not as packed too which was the major difference. Price, about the same to me so this shouldn’t be a factor to consider when you decide between both providers. Another major observation is the train looks a lot newer and cleaner."
