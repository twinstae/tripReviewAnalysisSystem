0,3.0,When you are healthy and don't have kids or older people with you: Save your time and money and walk up the hill. You will wait at the queue longer than you need to walk up. And you save some money.

I'm sure the view was great but being short, I couldn't see a thing as I was jammed into the middle. Make sure you push your way to the windows, where you can see the view, and you get some fresh air. There was either no air conditioning or it wasn't working. Made for an uncomfortable journey. Thankfully it's a short one!!"
