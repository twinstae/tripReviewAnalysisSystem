2,3.0,"We went here instead of paying for Lotte World's skating rink experience. We had some photos taken of Super Junior's, Kin Hyun joong 's etc. memorabilias, we had our little dubbing experience for You are beautiful, we had our compatability test with our favorite Suju members and we.... we were a little disappointed because we thought it was a big place but not at all. We felt that we wasted our money. We spent for a 15 minute of enjoyment. They should have made it bigger to maximize the fun. Although we had our chance to touch their hand prints, it was not enough to say that it is worth of our money."
