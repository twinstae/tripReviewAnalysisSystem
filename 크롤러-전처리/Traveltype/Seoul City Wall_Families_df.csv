0,5.0,"Maybe like a lot of people, we just stumbled upon this wall while looking for KIM MISO's house (Secretary Kim KD Drama).  the trek is entertaining as well as exhilarating.  The wall crosses all types of neighborhood so you can always stop to get refreshments in one of the many restaurants and convenience stores. Please wear comfortable shoes as cabs do not pass that often so you end up walking past your targeted number of steps.TIP: the trees are wonderful depending on the season. I think Autumn is the best"
1,5.0,Walking up from Naksan park then down towards DDP is definitely the preferred route. Pleasant uphill but would have been more difficult the other way round due to the terrain. Decided to skip the mural village considering the residents prefer it that way.
2,5.0,"Seoul City Wall (also called Hanyangdoseong) is an 18 km structure surrounding the city.  Much of the wall has been preserved or rebuilt but there are sections that are absent.  My wife and I hiked along the wall from the Heunginjimun (East) Gate in Dondaemun to the Changuimun Gate.  It is 7 km long, took almost 4 hours, and was our favorite part of our stay in Seoul.  Beautiful, moderate hike.First, bring your passport as the last half of the hike from the Malbawi Information Center to the Changuimun Gate is a restricted military area on account of it overlooking the President's House.  You need a passport to enter.  This section of the wall opens at 9 AM.  It is closed on Monday.  Second, I would follow our direction from the East Gate counterclockwise as the end of that route has many, many, many stairs - down going counterclockwise, up if you go clockwise.  I would not have wanted to start the hike with hundreds of stairs.From the start at the East Gate, you can choose to take the path inside the wall or outside.  I would recommend starting on the inside where you will pass the City Wall Museum and have access to a side visit to the Iwha Mural Village and the Naksan Gallery as you ascend Naksan Mountain.  Once you pass the peak of Naksan Mountain, you will start downhill and soon reach a street that traverses the wall.  At that point, I would switch to the outside the wall path.  We went on the inside path and got a little lost as we lost sight of the wall.  We eventually made it to the next Gate (Hyehwamun) but it is much easier to find from the outside the wall path.  Just past this gate you will come to the Hanyangdoseong Exhibition and Visitor Center.  You can stop, get a rest and get a map if you do not already have one.  They open at 9 AM.  If not open, follow the signs (or the little medallions in the street) to continue the hike to the next part of the wall - fairly easy to find.  Then you follow the wall to Waryong Park.From this Park it is a gradual climb along the wall to the Malwabi Information Center where you will be given a pass and enter the restricted military area.  From here, no photos to the South are allowed.  A fairly steep incline leads you for about a kilometer to the summit of Baegaksan Mountain.  Then down many steps to the final gate.  Again, you can enter the hike from that gate (Changuimun) but have to contest the many stairs in the up direction.  We stopped here and walked back to our hotel in Insadong or you can take a City bus. Or you can continue along the wall over Inwangsan Mountain (closed Monday). The hike was beautiful with great vistas, pine forests, interesting views of the wall up to 8 meters high, and other flowers and birds.  We started on Sunday morning at 7:30 AM and got to the restricted area around 9:15 AM. Not very crowded. Dondaemun Subway station, Line 4, Door 9 brings you right to the East Gate (Heunginjimun).  City Wall Museum opens at 10 AM.Bring some water and enjoy.  Just keep to the wall and follow the signs.  You will be glad you did."
3,5.0,"This place is amazing. Would recommend it to anyone going to Seoul to stop by and take a hike around the fortress. To get to the wall, we decide to walk through the old village instead of taking the bus."
4,4.0,"Depending on where you have started your walk, you will see different parts of Seoul walking along this wall. Although it is not as majestic as the Great Wall of China, it is a beautiful historical site. As the route span many kilometres long, I would suggest that you do a bit of research before setting off to see this Wall. I didnâ€™t do much research and started my walk from the Seoul City Wall museum.  It was along the way up the steep slope that I came across a map directory showing the whole length of the wall. Recommendation:Wear comfortable shoes, do your research to decide where you want to start your route."
