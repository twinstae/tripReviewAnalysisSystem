0,4.0,"An interesting museum dedicated to the presidents of Korea.  We were guided here after the Blue House tour and the museum ended up being a lot more interesting than the tour.  As most Korean presidents were corrupt, there isn't that much information.  But some interesting displays including gifts they received from other heads of state and the presidential guards.  Try to avoid going in at the same time as the large tour groups."
