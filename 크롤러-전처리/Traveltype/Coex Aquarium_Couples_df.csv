0,1.0,"Wasn’t aware that they had manatees before my visit. Manatees, seals and penguins all in VERY depressing enclosures. The manatee tank was completely bare and far too small for these animals. I found it quite upsetting and left swiftly after seeing these poor animals. Better conditions needed, this is the 21st century - have some compassion."
1,3.0,Tickets are over priced.Will not visit again.They had a decent variety of Marine life on display. Perhaps good to bring kids there.
2,5.0,"Not a fan of aquariums but this one was really great! Huge variety of amazing fish is never seen before, very curious and strange aquatic creatures. Huge tanks so lots of room to see and makes me feel at least a little bit better about the fish being kept captive. It’s got a lot of crazy stuff to see and the price is worth it."
3,3.0,"Don't get me wrong - if you have kids, it's a great interactive activity.As adults, having seen other aquariums, this is average. The exhibits are catering for children, so instead of trying to replicate natural habitats in the tanks, a lot have childish toys in them like a kids gold fish bowl.The aquarium does cover a range of different environments in the world - there's an Amazon rain forest including large otters. A desert area with phararie dogs. A section with manatees & then penguins. The viewing tunnel with sharks & rays doesn't have the larger species, but there is some impressive sharks.Overall, a good few hours if rainng or for the kids.Not the cheapest option so use your Discover Seoul pass to pay."
4,4.0,"Nice place for a rainy day. Very cool sea animals.Cost 28,000 each. If you have kids they will enjoy"
5,1.0,"This is an overly commercial exploitation of living animals. We have visited many aquariums in the world and this one was one of the worst, the tanks were way too small for the animals within them, especially the larger animals like manatees, crocodile, and the larger fish that were swimming around the tank in circles, bumping into the glass walls and clearly very uncomfortable with the small size of the tank. There was a section where you could handle and touch sea creatures, and within this section, were dozens of tanks and no staff around, with little children poking and squeezing the creatures continually, whilst the parents sat on phones.The entire aquarium is overcrowded with tourists too, many of them are very pushy and disrespectful and will literally push you out of the way to get themselves in the front of the glass, there is no information about conservation or how to protect these animals, the place was very clearly set up to be a commercial hub.Just please dont do it, it is heartbreaking to see the animals trapped in such small and overcrowded tanks. AVOID"
6,5.0,My husband and I decided to visit the Coex Aquarium when we were in Coex mall and it was one of the highlights of our trip to Seoul! You can see many different interesting sea animals! Highly recommended!
7,3.0,Not a lot of information on display. Might be better for kids. Not really somewhere you NEED to go to when in Seoul.
8,4.0,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Coex Aquarium - the first aquarium I have ever seen inside of a shopping mall. It was a bit overpriced, even with the tourist discount we got thanks to a travel brochure we picked up at the airport. The displays are quirky and unique, and even boasted some sea life, such as manatees, which we hadn't seen in any of our aquariums back home. Overall, a fun experience and a lovely outing if you have kids or if you are looking for something to do indoors on a very cold and/or rainy day."
9,4.0,"The aquarium is huge, and many interesting exhibits suitable for a trip with kids. The place is also quite spacious and not crowded on weekdays."
10,3.0,"We have visited many aquariums around the world and to be honest we found this one quite bizarre - plastic toys and cartoon characters in the fish tanks, video game machines next to the displays, the mermaid/clown fish show, rabbits and prairie dogs, vending machines everywhere so you were constantly trying to avoid bumping into people who were eating and drinking. The otter, beaver and penguin enclosures were really depressing. Having said that  it was very busy the day we visited and there were many families with young children who seemed to be enjoying it, but I would find it hard to recommend to anyone else."
11,4.0,"Went here on a weekday around 1pm. They have special shows which are usually done in the afternoon starting at 1:30pm. We bought our tickets online via Klook which was about $2 cheaper than buying it in-store.Overall experience was great, although there were a number of tanks that do not contain the species being described on the signboards.We spent more than 3 hours there because we tried to watch all the available shows and read almost all descriptions shown on the tanks."
12,3.0,"We saw great reviews about this Aquarium so stopped by. I guess if you have small kids, it's a great place for them to wander around. If not, well, don't expect Sea World. It's a pretty compact (& a bit handmade) aquarium that is part of the mall."
13,5.0,"Surprised how big this place is once we were inside.  Great collections, and children's program.  Nice and clean. Enjoyed it."
14,4.0,"My boyfriend and I went to the COEX aquarium over the weekend and it was one of our best days in Seoul. We spent quite a bit of time here exploring and reading about the many different types of fish and mammals.The draw card for me was the manatee enclosure, you're able to get quite close and observe them. There is a seating area in between the manatee and seal enclosure so you can chill out for a while and watch them.  The aquarium also has feeding times, so if you're lucky, you can see your favourite's in action or at least plan around that. All the enclosures are well looked after and the staff are friendly and helpful.I also found the first part of the exhibitions interesting, as it had a full history of Korean fish, which my boyfriend enjoyed a lot too. While they're not as pretty as the tropical fish, they're interesting to learn about.The cost is 28,000KRW each for adults which was worth it in my opinion. To get to COEX Starfield Mall you need to catch line 2 (green line) on the Seoul Metro and disembark at Samseong station. There are many signs in both Korean and English which will guide you to the Aquarium.All in all I definitely recommend this aquarium!"
15,5.0,I've done some Aquariums but this one is really well-done. There are a lot of animals that I didn't have the chance to see before that day. The visit will take you around 2 or 3 hours. The entrance is around 20 euros but it's totally worth it :)
16,5.0,"This is a must see for visitors to Seoul. Wonderfully laid out, allow time to see all the exhibits. They are diverse, and children are especially catered for with interactive games. One of the best laid out aquariums we have visited. Many species to excite interest with waterfalls and ponds an attractive addition."
17,4.0,Its a very big aquarium with so many separate sections for fishes and animals. Saw different and unique varieties of fishes and sea creatures. It took 2 hrs approximately for us to finish the tour of aquarium. Overall a good place.
18,5.0,"Spent 3 hours here one afternoon.  Well worth the price; make sure you take a picture at the poster in the mall for 10% off.  It's inside the mall, and a little hard to find, but once inside, it is a blast! So many different fish tanks, and so much to see.  The shark tank at the end is amazing, and big enough to really make you feel like you're inside the ocean!  Well worth the price."
19,5.0,"Best aquarium I've ever been to.Not normally one to visit aquariums but we visited after a full day tour of Panjumeon and the DMZ and needed a change of pace.We only had 90 minutes here as they were closing..easily could have spent more time here.The themed areas are very cute and I loved their inventive displays - especially the area with fish displayed in phone booths and fridges! Great wee bit where you can lie on a bed and just watch fish. Enjoyed the musical fish who interact with their space creating random notes. Impressive shark tank, and installations and the English translations of the different fish are very cute. Only down side - some animals need larger enclosures."
20,4.0,"well designed in the center of an underground mall adjacent to the COEX conference center and the Grand Intercontinental hotel. Rich in items, especially nice for children."
21,5.0,We bought the tickets for 25k each. Well spent.We where in there for about 2-3 hours. There were alot of activities for both adult and children to enjoy.They had a good variety of different fish.
22,4.0,"I enjoyed this place with my wife and we had a fun time checking out the fish and it was a lovely place and when you are done can you eat lunch in Coex. It is not a must see, but fun place if you lived her for a longer time or if you have kids."
23,3.0,This was a nice sized aquarium where you could get close to the fish and exhibits.  It would be a great place to go with kids.
24,3.0,"Frankly speaking the value for money is not so good in Coex Aquarium. There are not so many animals here, this attraction is more for chldren than for adults even though there were some interesting spots. However I will not recommend a visit to this aquarium and if I could come back to the past I would save 25000 Wons/ticket and skip this attraction. COEX shopping mall itself is not very interesting also, however it is a kind of must-see in Seoul as it is considered to be one of the biggest in the world."
25,4.0,"This is one of a good places to visit during in Seoul, especially for the aquamarine lovers. This is definitely a cool place with the very nice decorations but a bit expensive. But overall, it's such a lovely place to visit either with family, partner or friends."
26,2.0,"This aquarium caters to families with small children.  If this isn't you, go elsewhere.  If it is you, you and your children will have a very nice time."
27,5.0,"Some people might balk at the price, but it's worth it if you go as a group. It's a very nice aquarium with plenty of English information for visitors. We went as a school trip for students who were mostly English speakers and they really enjoyed it."
28,3.0,"The place is overrun with children and definitely geared towards them in my opinion.  We were 3 adults, and we of course still enjoyed all the sea life, but we did not enjoy the crowds.  I would avoid weekends if possible."
29,4.0,"This is a standard aquarium in that there are lots of tanks of fish. However they had one room laid out with tanks showing what would be from the beginning of the Han river to the sea. It also has what lives in a paddy field. There are unusual fish tanks (one uses a refrigerator ). There were also otters, beers and manatees."
30,4.0,"This a nice aquarium in the middle of the city and about five minutes from the nearest subway stop.  However, it is far too crowded, making it difficult to view the exhibits in a relaxing manner.  The exhibits are modern and professional."
31,2.0,"It's not that it's bad, but don't waste your time in Seoul on this attraction.  If you are travelling with children it will be a nice thing to do, but don't expect something special."
32,3.0,"Not as big and impressive as other aquariums in the world, you can spend some pleasant times to visit."
33,3.0,"It is located inside the Coex mall but it is closer to the Bongeunsa station. The aquarium is definitely geared more towards kids. You can stick your hands in one of the tanks where they keep those small fish that munch on your dead skin. The aquarium is not that big, but they have penguins, otters, manatees, sea turtles, beavers, sharks and rabbits (???). It's a nice place to chill on a hot summer day."
34,4.0,"This aquarium starts off like any other aquarium but then you get to the area of tanks that are shaped like a telephone box or fire extinguisher (same size a real one). The are also some rabbits, chipmunks, prairie dogs and Guinea pigs. It was quite crowded so it was difficult to see sometimes. There is a touch pool with some cool things like the sea pineapple and sea slug. There is only a small cafe which sells ice cream and a small selection of drinks inside the aquarium area, but a lot of good places around. Some quite pricey. You can get line number nine right to the door on the subway. Get off at Bongeusa station. This station wasn't on the map I picked up so I guess my map is old. As i didn't know about this station we caught line 7 to Cheongdam and walked down past the temple."
35,5.0,"We were very impressed with this attraction overall. Great care and planning, fun design elements and a variety of animals (including native species you'd be unlikely to encounter) made for an informative and entertaining experience. As a pair of adults (no kids) we'd recommend 1.5 - 2 hours for a leisurely encounter. With kids, perhaps adjust time expectations. This being Korea, great selfie opportunities abound and the tanks also lent themselves for some great pix and video to share w/ friends.  -- A tip for couples: we went late in the day on a weekday & that cut down on the kid-traffic, making the trip through a peaceful and soothing chance to unwind."
36,5.0,Very nice aquarium with a wide variety of animals. I will post more photos later. Lots of interactive things for children to do to make learning fun.  The mall was HUGE.  So many stores and places to shop and eat. Really good day but wear your walking shoes!!!!
37,4.0,"Loved the aquarium it starts with little tanks than gets bigger and better as it progresses , there are alot if things to see you can do this and explore within 2 hours"
38,5.0,"At first glance, i thought an aquarium in the middle of a mall, but i was very pleased. It had a lot of great aquatic creatures and was a good way to spend an hour"
39,5.0,"We were pleasantly surprised by the quality and size of this aquarium.  Lots of great exhibits with a variety of species from around the world, as well as many tanks highlighting the fish of Korea.  Exhibits were cleverly displayed, most signs provided in both Korean and English.  On a weekday late morning, we had the place almost to ourselves with very few other visitors in sight.  This would be a great rainy day activity; as it was, it filled several hours before we had to leave for the airport at the nearby CALT center neighboring COEX.  Great family activity, although my husband and I enjoyed it even without kids.  It might be considered a bit pricey after the low cost entrance fees to the royal palaces and free entrance to the War Museum, but once inside we had no regrets over paying the $20-22 fee.  Well worth it!"
40,5.0,"Very interesting place. We have really enjoyed. A lot of fantasy, a lot of imagination.We would like to have English guide."
41,5.0,While staying in Seoul my fiancee took me to this Aquarium and I loved it. I loved the way it was organized. Happy to say it has English and Korean on the explanations of each animal (I was quite worried how to understand it). My favorite parts were the sardines and the huge shark tank. Oh almost forgot... and I loved Doctor Fish. I recommend if you are in Gangnam to not miss it.
42,4.0,"This is a nice aquarium underground in the COEX mall. Definitely good for little kids, but also adults who love the marine life!"
43,4.0,Went on a Sunday and it wasn't that busy. Really wasn't expecting the aquarium to be this nice. Had a lot of animals and gave a discount on parking. Weekdays have more shows than weekends. Really happy and it was well worth the price of admission.
44,5.0,"This aquarium was a lot of fun. Even though we weren't coming here with kids it was a very enjoyable. It took us about 2 1/2 hours to get through all of the exhibits, but with kids I would plan more time. We really enjoyed the exhibits with the fish in random object such as a coke machine, and a fridge. That exhibit also had rabbits and guinea pigs in a bathroom setting that was quite humorous. It wasn't too crowded even though we went there the day after Christmas."
45,5.0,"One of the best aquariums I've been to. From the outside it looks like it is going to be a small aquarium, but inside it is very well done. A lot of time has been taken to decorate this aquarium. Spent a lot of time walking around. Would be great with little kids. It is great for big kids too :)"
46,5.0,The wife and I just so happen to be walking around the coex mall and saw signs for the aquarium so it peaked our interest. Was not expecting so much. It had a lot of different exhibits and provided places to make some great memories.
47,2.0,The Coex Aquarium is small and had a stale fish smell starting from main entrance. Not much fish to see but many parents brought their children there to watch the fishes.
48,2.0,"COEX was supposed to be a big center considering the reviews I have read. Well, it is not. Small shopping mall and unimpressive Aquarium. There is a Budhist temple just in front of it that is much more interesting"
49,5.0,"Located in the Coex Mall, this aquarium is entirely underground. When we started out I was thinking it looked like a fish store which didn't make me happy. However as we moved on, this turned out to be a most wonderful aquarium, it matches any worldwide large aquarium easily. I really enjoyed this."
50,3.0,"A small aquarium in the shopping mall Gangnam. Can try to put your hands in the water tub which is full of small fish to nibble away dead skin on your fingers. The best part is at the end of the aquarium, therefore if not much to tour around, then move faster to see the most instresting views at the end of the route."
51,5.0,I love coex aquarium!  Located within a mall there was alot to do even after u left. The aquarium itself is separated into different sections and now includes a touch and see section and where you can actually touch the fishes (its actually more like the mussels and etc type stuff) as well as dip your hands for the doctor fishes (known to eat the dead skin off your hands/feet). Theres also a science laboratory section where you can see the growth stages of the sea creatures. Best thing is that they made it so that you can easily take photos without it reflecting light off your pictures. Whole thing should take a bit over an hr. Hope u enjoy!
52,4.0,"I really didn't want to go to the aquarium, but my husband insisted we look at the fish so  I went with him. The price about $20 usd was a bit steep I thought, but none-the-less we entered. Never have I been so pleasantly surprised! The place was well layed out, with arrows pointing the direction so you didn't collide with other observers and just enough light to see, but not so much that the place seemed artificial and gaudy. Not only does the aquarium house fish, but it also has turtles, rabbits, alligators, beavers, and prairie dogs. In some cases, I saw creatures in person that until then I had only seen on Animal Planet or the Discovery Channel. I must say, the Coex Aquarium is a wonderful attraction and a must see if you visit Seoul."
53,5.0,"I visited the COEX Aquarium today and I really enjoyed it. The themes are good, with ample species of fish and wildlife. It is the first time I saw penguins and beavers in captivity. It was also the first time I saw a living corral.  The show was also good, and it did not involve petting animals.Overall a good two hours well spent."
54,4.0,"I was under the impression this place was going to be a really cruel place with no room for the animals to move but I was pleasantly surprised. The rabbits (yes they have rabbits) had heaps of room! Most fish tanks were relatively full for the smaller fish but nothing horrendous! The tanks for the larger animals such as sharks, stingray, manatee etc were huge and they had heaps of room! The only cage that I didn't like was for the monkey :( he needed more room. Otherwise the place in general was very exciting and fun - even for older people! The 'doctor' fish that eat dead skin cells off your hands and the Sharks were definitely my highlight! In my opinion overall worth the money and recommend!"
55,4.0,"We thought the COEX Aquarium looked modern and was imaginatively laid out.  To us, it was better than most, not as good as some others.  It had enough of interest to keep us occupied for a little over an hour.  It is located in a large shopping centre."
56,4.0,"Yes, it is an aquarium in a shopping mall, but surprisingly well done:  clean, well-organized, well-labeled (sufficient English signage and labels), well-lit.  The animals all appear to be well-cared-for and displayed in suitable educational settings.   That said, there are also humorous and creative goldfish tanks in washing machines and other unexpected setups.  I would call this a must-see stop for kids and aquarium aficionados.  We saw the sardine-dancing show, which was clearly for the kids -- scuba divers in royal robes -- but still entertaining.  We went on a holiday, so it was really crowded, though still manageable.  It is not cheap, but not outrageous, for 3 good hours of educational entertainment.  If you live in the area, buy an annual pass, to bypass the ticket queue.  I mean, you can go shopping, go to a movie, and drop by the shark tank.  What more could you ask for?"
57,4.0,"For an aquarium in a mall, it had an impressive variety of fish.  Many small tropical to even large shark tank.  Location was very convenient with large number of restaurants in mall.  Easy access to subway"
58,4.0,"I really enjoyed the Coex aquarium. Visitors are directed through the museum along a prescribed path, with each room or area promoting some different theme. There were fish that I had never seen before and some especially interesting creatures (the manatee exhibit was very cool). There were a few displays/pens that I found a bit disturbing due to the size. I found the monkey, beaver and crocodile exhibits to be far too small. On the whole however, I though it was great and would definitely recommend it."
59,4.0,Me and the Mrs missed this place on our last journey but we finally made it on time. We enjoyed this one more than the Building 63's Aqaurium. The animals here seemed more alive....well there was one beaver that seemed sickly. I think we stopped and took photos at every area. What was awesome were the dipping dot ice cream. I haven't had those in forever. My wife loved them as well. We did the one time purchase vs the annual membership....not sure why anyone woukd do a annual membership to an aquarium but each their own. Take your children here....they will have a blast
60,4.0,"My wife and I did this attraction towards the end of our trip and really enjoyed it, it's not far from the Buddhist Temple in Gangnam and is a great way to spend a couple of hours. The price isn't too bad from memory and a lot of the fishes and other animals would not be seen in any other aquariams.Well worth the trip."
61,4.0,It offer good aquarium's view and clean and also Kids love this.but this facility is not that big place than I expected.
62,4.0,"The aquarium in Seoul is great.  Located right in the middle of the city in the modern COEX mall, it is easy to get to by subway, walking, or bus. It is really nice.I went with my girlfriend on a weekend, and it was crowded, but the flow was good.  It is underground, so it is really cool and well ventilated, and I never felt like I was in a big crowd. Everyone moved around and through the line really well, and everyone was happy, especially the kids.  With so much to see, it is laid out and designed very well. Along with the most beautiful sea creatures that you will ever see, there are extras like other animals and reptiles. Lots of fun with  a Disney like flair with little props and stages for the kids.There are drink machines all along the ""caves"" inside, so you will not go thirsty, and plenty of staff around to help at any time.  Perfect day for the family. Going fast, 1 hour.  Taking your time, 3 hours. Well worth the $22 admission price."
63,4.0,"I havn't been to so many aquariums since they mostly display the same things. That beeing said I really liked this one. It's fairly big and have many different kinds of fish and other animals living in water (penguins, seals and sea lions etc.) We spent some hours here. There is a snacks area where you can buy hot dogs and drinks. They also have a souvenier shop that was good."
64,5.0,"Not huge but very attractive. They have many funny tanks like washer or harp-shaped tank with electronic strings which are make sound when a fish cross it. As for me the most amazing critters in Aquarium are manatees, seal and beavers. Manatees are look like huge sea cows who are pasturing under the water.What else. They have Electric eel hunting show. I missed it but it has to be very interesting. I watched one in other Aquarium and that is very unusual and cognitive. Try to find the feeding schedule so you will have more fun.The ""touch zoo"" tank was filled with frozen cold water so it is almost not possible to touch and play with starfishes in there. That is a great minus."
65,5.0,"We went here one afternoon because we had run out of things to do. I had wanted to go, but it was a bit pricey so it wasn't high on the priority list when I was planning.So glad we went!! It's really well put together. The animals are well cared for and the exhibits are really quirky. Some English, but not a lot, so sometimes you might want to know more about an animal or one of their educational exhibits but the information just wasn't available.It's actually in a really classy shopping centre (the COEX) which we quite enjoyed walking through to get there."
66,5.0,"Though not very very large, it has all the stuff I want for an aquarium.Really loved how it zones its sea creatures."
67,3.0,"I have been there twice. Last time i went i made the big mistake to go when there was a kids school field trip to the aquarium. Kids running and screaming everywhere kind of ruined the whole idea of going there. The aquarium itself is kind of nice when you get a chance to stop and look at everything, now its not the best but its not the worst i have seen. You can actually learn something if you get a chance to read the captions but the displays. So, all in all it was fun the first time i went but the second time i had a headache.. Scope out beforehand to make sure that you can actually see the marine life."
68,4.0,"Coming from a region - Southeast Asia - which has awesome aquaria in the cities (Singapore, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur), this one is really not that great in comparison. Still, good for a visit, and entertaining enough."
69,5.0,"We had no idea the COEX Aquarium would be so vast since it doesn't seem that large.It also had a lot of sea life we hadn't seen anywhere else.We thought the ~ 20,000 won admission price to be reasonable."
70,4.0,"My husband and I visited the aquarium on a Saturday afternoon and were surprised to find that the aquarium was by no means crowded.  The price of admission was a bit high (19,500 won per adult) but they had a good variety of things to see displayed in a nice way.  Even as two adults we easily spent over an hour and a half walking through it.  They had a couple places where you could touch different sea creatures that looked fun for the kids.  I'm not sure I'd pay the full price to go back again but it's a nice outing if you're looking for something fun to do inside for a couple hours."
71,4.0,"I came here while visiting the Coex mall with my sister, brother in law and wife.  We came on a weekend, using the subway.  If you travel to the aquarium using the subway you will have to walk a very long way.  Perhaps the aquarium is on the other side of the mall.  I felt like we walked the entire length of the mall.  It was very crowded at the entrance to the aquarium (perhaps this was also due to the weekend) and at first I was neither impressed or enjoying myself.  After traveling up an escalator there is a room filled with some pillars that have some fish swimming around in them.  The pillars are not that large and the fish were rather small.  I initially thought to myself that this place was pretty lame.However as we walked on further into the aquarium the displays became larger and more elaborate.  Fish were given their own enclosures and they were more exotic.  Farther along in the aquarium there was actually large sea animals such as stingrays and sea cows.  I think there was also a random enclosure that held some monkeys.  I am not sure why there were monkeys in the aquarium.  So, the first part of the aquarium was kind of a dud, but it certainly got better as you travel further into the aquarium.  I would recommend coming here on a day when it is not so busy, you will have more time to look at the fish and not be pushed along by hordes of people.  Nice place to go if you like fish and sea animals."
72,3.0,"I love aquariums and this one does not disappoint; however, it's not a great aquarium either. Watch out for weekends and holidays as this place can get crammed with kids whose idea of aquarium viewing is running around and banging on the glass."
73,4.0,I had a great time in this lovely aquarium. There were many fish varieties and the tanks were all lovely and clean and the animals looked happy.
74,2.0,"I was terribly disappointed by this aquarium.  For fifteen bucks a person, it had one good tank towards the end of the route, but mostly everything else was a childish display of average-looking fish in what were meant to be unusual situations.  Goldfish in a toilet bowl.  Goldfish in a phone booth with mannequins.  Goldfish in a diorama of a bedroom.  Things that are meant to make the average visitor squeal and go ""How cute!"" but with no substance or overall design scheme behind it.Go with your kids if they are easily amused, and if you don't care about the educational value of an aquarium.  Not recommended for anyone over the age of five.  Seoul Grand Park (the zoo) had a much better main tank, and it isn't even an aquarium!"
