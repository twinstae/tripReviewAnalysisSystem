The nice things about this mall is it had a lot of restaurants. We went to McDonald's for a quick bite.We suggest you to visit Yeouido Park while visiting this mall."
1,3.0,The reason we visited the place due direct access through our hotel Conrad. With access to the metro station. Still not so many shops open. With some restaurants and coffee shops.
2,4.0,"Conveniently located mall with lot of shopping options and eateries. Located a stones throw from Conrad in Yeuido and close to the IFC business centre, it offers travelers lot of options to shop, eat and unwind. A hypermarket is glaringly missing here."
3,4.0,I stayed at Conrad which has direct access to the mall.   There are all different types of restaurants and shops from baskin Robbins to traditional Korean restaurants. The mall is connected to subway line 9 and 5.  CGV movie theater also runs many movies even at mid night.
4,3.0,"As a mall this place is great. It has three floors of many western companies like Zara, H&M, Stradivarius and more. But we went there to have a good lunch after strolling the Yeoidu park which is just across the street and oh boy, I NEVER in my life have seen such a long waiting lines for every single restaurant. So eventually we just had a small snack at a coffee shop since the coffee shops weren't crowded. But it was really crazy those waiting lines, so be aware. We came also on the weekend, so it might not be the same on weekdays."
