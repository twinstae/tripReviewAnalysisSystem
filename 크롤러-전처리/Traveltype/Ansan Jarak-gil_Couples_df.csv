0,5.0,"I went to this mountain with my husband on a Sunday morning with the plan to have a relaxing walk along the Ansan Jarak-gil. This wooden path is a loop around the mountain, designed for strollers and wheelchairs. But once there we decided to go up to the Fire Beacon on the top of the mountain. The climb to the top was a bit challenging at some places but the views along the way and from the top were definitely worth the climb!"
1,5.0,"This is a recommended site for those who have perhaps been to Seoul a few times and feel like they have seen a lot of the tourist sights that the city has to offer. For a change we decided to stay at the nearby Hilton Grand hotel and we came across this hidden gem of a hike route. The route can be accessed on several sites around the hill itself and is very well sign posted, look for any signs to Ansan Jarak-Gil as per one of the photos attached here. It is a short walk from the Hilton and from several underground stations. It was absolutely the best way for a regular Seoul visitor to spend half a day out of the city. The walk provides a nice way to see a bit of 'urban nature' and get some exercise. We did this walk on a hot September day and were pleased to find that parts of the walk were in the shade under the canopy of the trees. We were the only westerners on the walk that we saw that day, but with it being a Sunday it was quite clearly a popular way to spend the day for the local Koreans. Most of the walk is actually not on the hillside itself but on built decking (see picture) that makes the walk very easy as there are very few steps to navigate. Having said that, some of the walk on the decked route can be very steep so do expect to break a sweat! Very much a recommended alternative to the usual Seoul sights."
2,4.0,"Ansan Jarak-gil is a 7 kms circular walking trail located in Seodaemun-gu, the path was designed and created in 2013 suitable for strollers, wheelchairs, senior citizens, pregnant women and children.  The path takes you on a gentle slope, through forest and with good views of the city of Seoul.  We noticed an information board and map about the trail in Seodaemun Independence Park, the closest subway station is Dongnimmum (exit #5)."
