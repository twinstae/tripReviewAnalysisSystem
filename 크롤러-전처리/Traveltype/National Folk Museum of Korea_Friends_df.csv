Before my trip, I already read articles about this place, but seeing it in person was such an awesome experience. It features another side of Korea's history, its folks and their lifestyle. Inside the complex you can find the traditional water system and models of traditional Korean houses. It also has an area for its native statues. The entire place is just so lovely.

The museum is averages sized and you can easily walk around it in an hour. It tells a story of old Korea and fills in some of the gaps that you may have about its past.The replica style of an old village is excellent and it incorporates the inclusion of western ideology alongside Korean culture. The little comic shop is a must see.There is a little cafe to grab a drink and a small souvenir shop with cool stuff.I wasn't disappointed and would go again. Don't want to spoil it for you, add to your list and visit!"

Lovely outfits for all family members. Not sure if our western bodies could handle sleeping on the floor like was demonstrated, and the doctors visit display was a hoot, as was the exorcism lady who cured you with her fan dance!Lots of school groups there at our visit, but they were well ordered and we enjoyed our time there without hassle.

Truly a sight to see!"

The museum is divided into different sections from traditions to other interesting facts about Korean history. You can take pictures and videos."

You can see a lot of things that they do and have. The place was quiet interactive with all the descriptions and pictures. I don't think you really need a tour guide to visit this place. If you have kids they will enjoy this place because they can see a lot of puppet and nice costumes here. Worth to visit! Thanks
66,5.0,This place is only next to gyeongbokgung palace. Put this place on your must visit in Seoul. You also can visit Korean Blue House after..
67,4.0,"I visited this museum on a rather damp autumn afternoon. It was a good choice in many ways. The setting is quite beautiful as the museum is set in extensive splendidly walled and gated grounds. In Autumn the trees in the grounds bring some fabulous colour to the museum experience. On my visit lots of  people were taking the time to take pics in the grounds and it was good to see a colourful kindergarten group running around enjoying the space too. The site has two wonderful pagodas that make a great backdrop for photos and give a good view of some distinctive Korean physical culture. The Museum itself is a modern addition and I definitely came away with a better understanding of Korean culture and history. The displays are well spaced out, and the text is in English as well as Korean. I did want the dates to be included in the text more frequently as I had to keep going back to check the sequences but the text is generally good - not too lengthy or esoteric.Lots of visuals support the text so it isn't too demanding. A couple of good ""walk through"" building displays. Shop and cafe on site - nothing very noteworthy. Overall a very pleasant relaxed afternoon and one that I would recommend."
68,2.0,"It takes about 20-30 min to walk through this visual exposition which is not a true museum,but rather an educational poster activity.  There are virtually no historic pieces displayed."
69,5.0,"This is a cultural heritage museum in which the exceptional knowledge of the staff brought the exhibits to life.  I spent several days at this museum as it hosted an international group of museum professionals and students. All of us are members of UNESCO Internal Conference of Museums, Council on Museum Collections .  I highly recommend the ginger tea latte purchased from the nice ladies who have the refreshment area near the patio entrance. Lovely museum, excellent management."
70,4.0,It is easy to find the museum from the Gyeongbokgung Palace. No admission fee as it is included in the ticket for Gyengbokgung. We went around the museum since it was raining outside. But it was interesting to see around inside the museum.
71,4.0,You can get here through Gyeongbokgung Palace and is worth a trip as part of your visit. If you are interested in learning about Korean culture then you will find it very interesting. If not then there are still some interesting things on display. There is a large agricultural section with example houses so a little more interesting than some other agricultural museums. There is a dedicated children's section for young children. I can't really comment on this section as we did not use it but we could see lots of bright interactive elements. Immediately outside there was an area with little stalls and there were children getting involved with weaving straw and other activities.
72,4.0,"Not the most EXCITING exhibition ever but super interesting. My girlfriend is Chinese and this was a lot more interesting for her than it was for me.Beautiful Museum, excellent layout, great stories and introductions. The museum gift shop was great for pleasant little souvenirs for the family back in Canada!"

79,4.0,A good place to see. Though i had great difficulty in visiting this place due to very chilled weather.
80,5.0,"It‚Äôs a very interesting museum focusing on the cultural history of folk life in Korea. It is located inside Gyeongbokgung Palace. Not to be confused with The National Palace Museum which is located near the entrance in the south side of the palace. The folk museum is on the eastern side. You can spend a few hours in the museum and an entire day checking out the palace and the palace museum. I recommend you bring snacks and water because your options are limited inside and around the museum. I went in the summertime and though the a/c was on, it was very warm inside. You can probably see similar exhibita and displays in the National museum but if you‚Äôre going to Gyeongbokgung, it‚Äôs worth stopping in. I believe it was free to enter as well."
81,5.0,"we went on a Cherry Blossom Tour and one of the stops was at the National Folk Museum.  We throughly enjoyed the museum,  it was full of colorful displays from Koreas history.  We liked how they blend artifacts, film and sound.  There is a cool burial display that has a ""coffin"" that is similar to an Ark.  There is a gift shop and nice bathrooms.  The grounds were beautiful.  We were there during cherry blossom blooming time and took just as many pictures outside of the trees as we did inside.  Within a short walking distance you can also see many other sites such as The Blue House, a Palace, a Photography Musuem..."
82,5.0,"Thanks to skilful local guide (Michael Kim ultimatekoreatour@gmail.com from UltimateKoreaTour) we managed in one day to visit Buckhon haoak village, Blue House, Gyeong Palace (with costume parade), National Folk Museum, War Memorial Museum and Insadong Street where we had time for lunch. I think that it was optimal program for one day and it would not be complete without the Folk Museum. Highly recommend!"
83,5.0,"I suggest that before you go to Gyeongbukgung Palace, visit the Folk Museum first. This will make you appreciate more of what you will see in the palace. The museum is a glimpse of the history of Korea, it is beautiful and very informative introduction to Korean culture. From the museum, you can enter the palace through the National Folk Museum gate entrance."
84,4.0,"Located inside the grounds of Gyeongbukgung Palace, this museum gives visitors a history lesson about Korea and its people.  I really liked the use of exhibits to explain how people, from rich to poor, lived, ate, married and were buried.  I visited as part of a tour of the palace but there were English signs explaining the exhibits."
85,5.0,"The National Folk Museum of Korea is a very great museum to be visit during your holiday in Seoul. First, because this museum is located at the Gyeoungbukgong palace. So.. For me is just like a one package tour. Second, the museum does not charge you anything or on the other words its free. And the more important one are the museum is will tell you a lot of exciting history of South Korea from time to time. I really enjoyed my visitation in this museum. They show us a lot of things about their history through its memorabilia stuffs. Its a huge museum, and very clean. What makes me more interesting that this museum also have a museum / exhibition area for kids. Very fun and I never see the same concept before. They also have a souvenir store in the near of entrance door, which sell many things from books to accessories. It is very recommended to spare your time also to knowing Korea more better through this museum."

Cafeteria was very small though."

90,5.0,The museum has amazing historical story with every detail of it. It has a store with lots of handmade art that you can buy as souvenirs.

96,4.0,Great stop through if you're in Gyeongbukgong Palace or surroundings area. The museum gives  a great insight in the lives of the Korean people dating centuries back to the present. The museum is well laid out with a coffee shop and bathroom facilities accessible. Highly recommended. Learn about the Korean culture and history.
97,5.0,The best thing about this museum is that you don't have to pay any entrance fees to get in. It's also good to make this first on your itineraries so that you'll be able to understand Korean culture more. It is also very accessible and near Gyeongbukgong palace.

It is well curated and designed in such a way that you are able to learn many things without becoming too overwhelmed or bored. I loved learning about the traditional lifestyle of Koreans. A lot of attention was paid to make the museum visually and aesthetically appealing. Also, the location can't be beat. You are in the heart of Seoul and within walking distance of other fun things to do like, palaces, picturesque neighborhoods (Hanok Village, Insadong, Angukdong), chic cafes, and restaurants."
99,4.0,"I went there on Chuseok holiday in Korea and all the guided tours weren`t working For a city well known for never stopping, sounds reasonable that they stopped at Chuseok, the thanks-giving holiday of South Korea. It was half opened. Just the museum."
100,4.0,"The mixture of colors of their murals, galleries showcasing life size display of houses, shoes, ornaments were very delightful to see.

101,4.0,We went to the National Folk Museum after taking the English tour at the Gyeongbokgung Palace. The museum was very organized and the artifacts were preserved well. It was a good learning experience. Will definitely go back and get a guide next time!
102,4.0,"The exhibit that shows the Korean traditional customs from marriage through child bearing years, the celebrations and death were really interesting and informative. If you are lucky enough to have a guide, you will absorb a lot more of the details."
103,5.0,"This is a stunning museum with exhibits that depict the entire history and culture of the Korean people.  If you want to truly appreciate the culture of this country, this museum is the place to visit.  Well worth the time and money."
104,4.0,"To learn and understand the history, people and culture of korea, This will be a good place to visit. It is within the place area.There are 3 gallery and the 3rd one is the most interesting as it shows the korean house, clothing, food, etc. The other 2 are about history of korea civilisation. So unless you spend a whole day here, you seriously cannot see everything. By the time you complete the palace tour about 3 hours, you are too tired to spend alot of time here. However, we were fascinated by the korean cultureWe like that it was so clean and well displayed. Good place if you are interested in the history."
