0,5.0,I had a great time and I went solo! FYI The museum allows you to rent tripods! I took these photos myself. The place is really cool!!!
1,2.0,"It's fun inside, but only if you go together with someone else, or as a family or group of friends, not alone. Selfies are worthless.Solo travelers could better spend their time elsewhere."
2,4.0,I was travelling alone and visited this place on rainy winter afternoon.  I am adult and quite plain in personality but this place turned out to be quite interesting.  The only catch is you need to go with friends in order to take lots of photo shoots to keep in as memory. I was fortunate to have a lady staff willing to make my visit more interesting by offering her 1hour to accompany me to take the shots.  A job well done to the Alive Museum team at Insadong.Would recommend and I paid 65% of the original admission price as I got discount coupon.
3,4.0,I went to Korea by myself.  So I went in this museum by myself.  Very cool artwork.  But definitely a lot better if you go with someone else so that you can get really good pics with these funky artwork.
4,2.0,"In this museum you can pose with the trompe l'oeil paintings and have your friends take a picture.  It might be fun with a group of friends.  I found the scenes all a bit kitschy (Bruce Lee karate move, King Kong, Jaws)."
