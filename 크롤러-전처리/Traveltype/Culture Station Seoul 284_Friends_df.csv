0,4.0,Happened to go through the new railway station and arrived at this place. Peeked inside and took a free tour. Different from the usual fare and had some fun with us being digitally imaged on the screens. And there was a wee bit of nudity....... A good hour well spent and learnt a bit about the railway station history.

On entry i received a little ticket likened to the old style tickets that were used in the past. A good touch.Its not just about trains. I saw different art exhibits so there is something for all.The architecture is amazing and i am so glad that they have preserved it. Not many people visit this little gem, put it on your list. :)"

I haven't been on a train since then but have visited the station to meet up with friends. The inside of the station is clean and has many cafes or restaurants. It is always crowded with people traveling with their luggages so make sure you're not in their way. :/ Last time I was there, my friend traveled all the way from Daejon to visit me for a few hours. We were on a time crunch so instead of leaving the station, we decided to stay there so she can get right back on the train. We looked around and picked a Japanese restaurant since it was less crowded and had a lunch special. Afterwards, we sat at a caf√© to chat until it was time for her train. It was very convenient to hang out in the station and prices seem affordable. I have also taken the subway to the airport from Seoul Station which takes less time than a bus to Incheon. I would definitely recommend traveling from Seoul Station since it's like a central hub. FYI, the smoking area which is located next to the main entrance is very dirty and it stinks. :( While waiting for my friend, I happen to look inside and it was so dirty with the ground covered with cigarrete buds and spit. YUCK! I also saw this guy drinking soju while smoking inside. He seemed quite drunk and talking to himself but I guess it didn't bother the other smokers inside. LOL. If you have to smoke, do it fast and leave!"
3,4.0,Very big and modern station. Staff were helpful and it was very easy to navigate around the place once we arrived from busan.
4,3.0,"Tourists should note that this was perhaps the sketchiest area we travelled to - there are homeless people laying around all over the area in broad daylight (the only place I saw this in Seoul). If you are in the area and want to grab a quick pic, that's fine but I would not go out of my way to come here."
