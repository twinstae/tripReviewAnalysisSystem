0,4.0,Rushed to visit the lantern festival but only managed to see it for 5 mins before lights off.  Should leave the lanterns on till 11pm or 12 midnight as there were still many people lingering after lights off.

Often seen in K-dramas, it is even more beautiful at night with all the light designs during the Seoul Lantern Festival. Enter on the west side of the river and walk along to see this year's creations. You can either climb back up the stairs at the end to go to a small street festival with food and such or cross the last bridge to view from the other side. Be advised it is not the easiest to hail a cab in this area because of the number of people so be sure to plan your trip accordingly."

It was fun to wander along the Cheonggyecheon to see the colorful lanterns displayed in & along the stream. However, this festival pales in comparison to the much larger and more elaborate lantern display in the same area for Buddha's birthday in the spring. It would be fun to see the fall Seoul Lantern festival if that is when you are visiting the city, but if you have a chance to see the lanterns at Buddha's birthday it is much more impressive!"
