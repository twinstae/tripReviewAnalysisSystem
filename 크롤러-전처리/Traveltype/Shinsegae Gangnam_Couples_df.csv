0,4.0,We normally go to the gangnum store near thebus terminal. Thought we would give this one a try as we were staying across the road. The food court was underwhelming compared to the gangnum store. Probably not as big. Still nice however.
1,3.0,We went to the food court which was in the basement level of the department store. There was a good variety of foods to sample in the food court but we thought it was a bit on the pricey side. We opted for a bucket of fried chicken – we chose a few different flavours of fried chicken and filled up our bucket half way. It came to about 13000 won.

The department store is just kinda whatever, not too different from other higher end department stores I've been to in other parts of Asia. The food court in the basement is worth a look though, there is a little stall selling Japanese cheese tarts (I think the shop is called ""Bake Cheese Tart"", it has a black and yellow logo)  that are phenomenal (the line is usually pretty long but moves fast and they're sooo worth it). There's some other neat stuff there, but definitely try the cheese tarts if that's something that might interest you. If you sign up for their little loyalty card as a foreigner (took like 5min, I thought it was for the whole mall, but it's just for the dept store) you get some little coupons and stuff (like a free Starbucks coffee). I originally thought it was just the department store here and a bunch of other high end shops connected to the Marriott, but it's actually connected to a pretty decent mall. I'm not sure the name of the mall though, it might be several malls interconnected (It might be part of the GoTo mall), but it all connects to the Express Bus Station. There's lots of brand name shops like Uniqlo, Converse, etc, and more food courts as well (and some small restaurants). It's worth checking out if you're in the area,"

We tried the Korean beef hot pot noodles at the Korean restaurant 甜蜜 which was pretty good. The flavor wasn't too overpowering and wasn't spicy,  which is rare for Korea."
4,4.0,"This is one of the best department store in Seoul, as it's located at the Express Bus Terminal & on top of huge underground shopping center. You can literally shop at this high end store for top notch brand name & grab some traditional food at the bus station of underground shopping area, and decide to shop some more at the discount stores that line the underground shopping center. Also, selection of food items are great at Shinsegae as well!"
