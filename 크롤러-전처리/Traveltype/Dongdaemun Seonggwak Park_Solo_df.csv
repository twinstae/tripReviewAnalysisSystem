0,4.0,"When I came to Dongdaemun to view the Heunginjimun Gate, I noticed there is an uphill path just across the road, alongside the old Seoul City Wall. I decided to climb up for a better view of the surrounding area. There is this small park along the hillside. It was quiet, with only a few locals there. A good place to relax and enjoy the view."
1,5.0,Bring your coffee with you and relax in the pagoda then when you're done climb along the wall to the museum and on your way enjoy the beautiful views of the city and mountains.I really loved the park and highly recommend visiting.
