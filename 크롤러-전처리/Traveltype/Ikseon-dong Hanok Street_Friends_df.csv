The area is made up of connecting alleys which makes you feel like you are in a maze but there's something good waiting for you at every turn. Quaint little shops and cafes converted from ancient architectures filled up the streets, displaying a perfect blend of modern and history in the heart of Seoul."

2,4.0,It was crowded on a weekend but we enjoyed walking through the narrow lanes and browsing in the interesting shops housed in traditional korean houses. There were some boutiques selling local design items which caught our eye. One can easily lose track of time inside the shops.
