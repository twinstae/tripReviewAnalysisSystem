0,4.0,Interesting history of the korean stamps: small but abundance of history. It is not English friendly as the other museums
1,4.0,Can diy own stamps here with a small stamp store. Interesting for stamp fans. It has a library of all stamps issued by Korea Post.
2,2.0,"I would think this to be a ridiculous place but to each his own. Had this been a sports cards museum, I would have been super excited and other people might think it is so boring so we all have our own preferences. I wasn’t disappointed because we didn’t know we were going to come here. We were just on our way to Myeongdong again; we seemed to have come here every day while we were in Korea and I saw this museum. I checked the price of admission and it was free. They have many exhibits again if you are into stamps, it’s worth checking out. Since I wasn’t, it was just ok but the place was very colorful and had English signs everywhere. We were there only about 20 minutes as that’s all my wife could bare. I could have stayed cla bit longer but I have to keep the wife happy. If you have some time to kill, go ahead and stop in here and check it out since it is free."
