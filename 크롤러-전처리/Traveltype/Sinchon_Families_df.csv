0,4.0,I enjoy this area very much. Relaxing. Nice street and cute places. Very pleasant to see young people all around. Shops are bustling. But yet it is so relax to shop.
1,5.0,"Basically, Ehwa Womans Uni is located in Sinchon and the shopping street outside the university. Just take the subway to Ehwa Womans Uni and Sinchon is within walkable distance. Prepare 3 hours for this area as it is long and a lot of shops and stalls to visit."
2,3.0,"I was looking forward to Sinchon but I have to admit I was abit bored here. The shopping didn’t really appeal to me as there were more shopping malls opposed to small quirky shops, and I much prefer the selection at the streets over at Edae. Lots of food places and drinking holes. This seems to be a place that comes alive only at night as a lot of the eateries etc weren’t open when we were there (around lunchtime) and seems more catered to a younger demographic/students etc."
3,4.0,"So many choices for food and shopping.  Found an arcade my young son enjoyed, would love to visit later in the night.. looks like it would be fun."
4,5.0,Easy and convenient to travel anywhere in Seoul by subway/bus/taxi. It is also a walking distance to Hongdae if you don't want to take the subway. They also have one of the cheapest guesthouses!
