1,5.0,"Visit the park on Apr 3, Sakura almost get flower, nearby the main river of Seoul. Easy to have beautiful pictures"
2,4.0,"Do pop by if you are nearby, otherwise I don't think it's worth it to come here. Went when cherry blossoms were in bloom, but there are many other places to view cherry blossoms as well. Overall a nice place for a stroll but only if you are nearby."
3,5.0,"This park and area are famous within the locals and tourist. Especially when I came here during cherry blossom season, better to come early to enjoy cherry blossom. This area is quite large. Can enjoy the city view, hangang river, nice weather, and picnics with your friends. I walk more further from Yeouido Hangang Park to see cherry blossom and i found the area that is really beautiful and enjoyable. Also there are some street food stall near the park. I love to spend some time here to relaxing my soul. And I think, during sunset time will be nice too even we can't see the sunset from this park."
4,5.0,"A night walk after dinner around Yeouido park ~Wonderful place with nice cherry blossom üå∏ view , cooling surrounding and nice scenery view!Lucky me ‚ò∫Ô∏è there are full of cherry  blossom and drama/movie taking just around it ~ Running man Jeon so-min just finish her part and leaving in front of me ~ so regret that I can‚Äôt had a chance to take photograph with her üò©"

7,5.0,"This is a huge park in Yeouido.One of the best parks to ride a bicycle in Seoul. And REALLY famous for cherry blossoms. So, if you don't want to mess with crowds, stay away on cherry blossom weekends."
8,5.0,good place to see river view and can breathe fresh air. can see so many beautiful places from there.
9,5.0,"It must be the most beautiful season when we visited the park, walking along the river bank was looked like passing a sukura flower tunnel. It was still a little bit cold for us who were from the warm Southwest China. There were also lots of local specialty street vendors."
10,4.0,"Visit this park, adjacent to the Han river and a new business and shopping district. Close to IFC underground shopping mall."
11,5.0,"Been here many times with my friends.You can do a lot of things with friends and families. Celebrating birthdays here, picnic, camping, riding a boat and bicycle and so on....also many  beautiful view for sight seeing.In spring time there's a cherry blossom. in summer time there's a water park.So its a great and recommendable park."
12,4.0,"nice park to walk, i went there with the cherry blossom festival and i was in love with all the flowers"
13,4.0,"Went here just to strolling around. The park was so nicely build and taken care of. So clean and the surrrounding was so peaceful eventhough it is in the middle of the buzzling city. You can try to bring your lunch here (get it in the nearest convenient store) then sit down in the park, enjoy!"
14,5.0,"yeouido park would be a difference if you visit at the different season, the best season is spring! you can just seat on the grass, feel the spring breeze, cycling, picnic. during the spring, the park is so beautiful. note, sometimes, even tho it is spring, the weather still has no different from the winter. make sure, you check the forecast before you come. if you get out from the yeouido station, you still has to walk about 300m to the park. i usually get down at sindorim station and then get the bus straight to the yeoido park. or you can get down to yeouinaru station"
15,5.0,"I was planning to visit Seonyudo Park but was recommended by a Korean Friend to visit this instead. This park didn‚Äôt disappoint, the river view was nice on a bright sunny day. I hear the night view is amazing too but wasn‚Äôt there in the evening. There were many families having picnics along the stream and so nice to watch all the kids running around. I rented a bike for an hour (3000krw) so there isn‚Äôt a need to walk that much. According to a Friend, eating cup noodles is a Korean thing to do at Yeouido park where there are instant cooking stands at the shops. I didn‚Äôt try it since it was still pretty hot in summer but I can imagine it‚Äôd be nice to have some hot noodles here when the weather is chilly."
16,5.0,"if you live nearby this park in cherry blossom season then do not skip this place.  it was really beautiful visit during March/April this year (2018).  enjoyed the beautiful trees. it looks more beautiful in nature than it look in pictures. no much things to do. just for walking and relaxing with family.  there is a small market for quick bite.  also, there is a huge open yard for playing around.  also, there is a street nearby full of cherry blossom trees.  i loved it during this season.  other seasons i am not sure how it looks."
17,4.0,"I swear by Yeouido Park because it has .. LAWNS!! These are very rare in central Seoul, but at Yeouido Park you can spread out a blanket and have a picnic in several spots. Even more, you can ride a bike along the shady perimeter circular route (or walk/jog if that's your thing). It's squeaky clean, has lots of big old trees for shade, and miraculously keeps out most of the car noise from the outside world. Once you get in to this rectangular little oasis, you really get refreshed."
18,4.0,A few friends and I decided to see what Korean parks would be like and came out here for a quick visit. This park is much larger than it seems so rent a bike or even roller skates (there are places in the park to rent them) and tour around leisurely and enjoy the sights. I think it'll be nice for family with kids too! NOTE: I was here in the late summertime so it was hot that I didn't go too far but I heard in the springtime the cherry blossoms are beautiful.
19,4.0,"We visited Korea during the cherry blossoms seasons and went to Yeouido park to visit the cherry blossoms festival.  It was great.  I guess at any other period of the year this would just be a regular a bit boring park (even if you get a good view of downtown seoul from there), but during the cherry blossoms it was the best! so beautiful!"
20,5.0,"If you're traveling to take a break from your busy days, definitely visit this place. Bring a picnic mat or rent one, they also have tent rentals around if you're going on a big party. Get some food, head to the one and only Ministop inside the park for some ramyon and drink and ice cream and all of those good stuffs, or if you have a company who speaks Korean, order a chicken delivery. Just sitting there for a while feels really great, and sometimes they have performances, water sports, and everything else that are entertaining. Bonus: they have a beautiful illumination at night, I don't know if it's during Spring or the entire year, but it'll be great to check out."
21,5.0,"Went here on a whim. Enjoyed the 2 hours spent here laying on the ground. Could‚Äôve rented a bike but didn‚Äôt wanna rush to return it after. It‚Äôs such a nice park, teenagers and couples come here to have a picnic and watch the sun sets. It‚Äôs really nice"
22,5.0,"We visited Seoul in April this year to mainly watch cherry blossoms at this park. The park is beautiful and large. There are many things to see in this park, including hundreds of cherry trees in the park, as well as on the streets circling the park.Even if we missed the Spring Flower Festival (being deferred to later days) when we were there in the first week of April, we enjoyed our walk around the park. We also enjoyed the walk along the Han River next to the park. The walk is lined with many street vendors selling local foods."
23,4.0,We were there for the Spring Flower Festival.  It's quite crowded and there're performance on the street.Walking along the park with this beautiful scene is very relaxing. We aligned at National Assembly Station and took a short walk to the park.
24,5.0,I visited this small park at the height of the Cherry Blossom bloom season in early April.  It was especially beautiful at this time.  The center of the park has a skate park and basketball courts and were filled with people enjoying the early spring weather.  The outer edge of the park is a long walking path that passes under cherry blossom trees.  A nice 30 minute stroll!
25,5.0,Great place to view cherry blossoms as the road is lined with thousands of cherry trees on either side. We visited one day before the festival started and could drive through the entire stretch. Excellent place to enjoy cherry blossoms in Seoul.
26,5.0,"4 subway stations are around Yeouido-dong.  More restaurants, cafe can be found at the road side ""Gukhoe-daero 68/70-gil"" near the National Assembly station.  The atmosphere on weekdays and weekend are different.  But restaurants many closed on Sunday.Travel around early to mid-April is the best Cherry Blossom season at Seoul.  Yeouido Park is one of the most popular destinations for viewing cherry blossoms.  Recommended to travel during the cherry blossom festival at night time."
27,5.0,9 April onwards is the time where the Cherry blossoms flowers bloom. Should last about a week to 9 days. It is a great place to see in Seoul. Take a subway to National Assembly station line 9. Walk through the National Assembly for about 7 minutes. You will reach the park along the lake.
28,4.0,"Nice park, large playground at central Plaza then followed by a nice stroll along lush of greens and trees, also flowers. You don't feel your are in the city center."
29,5.0,"Best time to go today or this week, sunny days. Nice weather. Lots of Cherry Blossom. Most are white colour, only few are pink"
30,4.0,Good place to relax and spent with kid. Bicycle rental is available and few stall of street food available.
31,4.0,A fairly calm place to spend an afternoon. There are food options nearby and it is comfortable with the breeze coming off the Han river. Many families come here with their young kids and there is a campsite there for some festivals. A place for many locals to come and unwind. This park is also popular among teenagers during the weekend. When the weather is warmer the smell of bar-barque is in the air.
32,4.0,"This park has a lot of facilities, not only for kids but also for adults and seniors. We visited this park on cold sunny day.This park was nice enough to walk around. The pond was frozen with leaves in it. In the middle of the park, there was King Sejong statue."
33,3.0,"Yeouido park is super crowded during cherry blossoms period from early to mid April. There are more cherry blossom trees here than any other places in Seoul, that's why this is number 1 spot. Cherry blossoms are lined up along 1 km road. I visited in mid April 2017 when cherry blossoms at Seoul forest park, Kyungyee university, Namsan park and Seokchon lake were way beyond their peak. Yeouido park was still beautiful."
34,5.0,"Not just my favorite park in Seoul, but my all time favorite.  Better than Golden Gate Park in San Francisco (though it is much bigger).  And New York Central Park can't even compare.  I say this mainly because this park is keep very clean and in great condition.  Lots of beautiful views and connecting to Han Park as well.April is the best time because of the cheery blossom trees blooming.  The last time we were here, it was April, but really crowded because everyone else wants to come see the beautiful views.  It is also a time of year when it is not hot and humid.There are places along the way where you can buy some drinks and snacks, and you will see many people on rented bicycles.  Some locals bring their bikes.  We have never seemed to have trouble parking.  There is a fee in most areas at the park, but I consider it cheap.Just plain to spend a whole day there and have a picnic."
35,5.0,"My daughters and I rented bikes on a cool Autumn morning, just as the leaved started changing. 9000 won for 3 bikes for an hour (tandem bikes are also available). It was money well spent! It was so lovely to bike around the park! The bike track is flat and suitable for all levels. It was so peaceful and relaxing. You could stop along the way and take in some of the gorgeous scenery. There are also 2 little cafes in the park if you feel like a snack. Highly recommended!Just note that to rent bikes you will need to present one piece of ID (e.g. passport)."
36,5.0,it was so packed when i went here at Spring season.even though is not holiday but even the local people gather in here.Bloom everywhere!!! (human and flower)
37,5.0,"We specifically chose to visit Korea in the spring so we could catch the famous cherry blossoms in their full splendor, a decision that paid amazing dividends. With our son and daughter-in-law living in Korea, we were fortunate to have the best guides show us the best things Korea has to offer. We made it a whole day event, and luckily, we had the best weather for a long and pleasant walk through the park. The welcoming scenery was incredible! We've seen Washington DC during the cherry blossom season, and although it is a experience to cherish, Yeouido Park will by far always be second to none. What a magnificent site! We got there during the peak time and every tree and every bush was covered in blossoms. Pinks galore, whites and other colors were a true feast for our eyes. We chose to get a map, which you can pick up at the entrance, so we could find our way around. It was so wonderful to see how Koreans truly make use of such a stunning facility, we saw hundreds of local residents in sports attire taking to the numerous trails around the park. They obviously love to hike and enjoy the outdoor, and th. Are with which park official manage the park ought to be applauded. The park is very clean, it's kept in the most amazing condition, there are all kind of facilities throughout, clean restrooms in multiple spots, and even food stands to pick up light snacks. This was truly a wonderful day and the experience will last a life time. Beautiful park! We went in April, so be sure to take a light jacket or sweater, temperature can change rather quickly, so be pr pared. There are excellent sidewalks and flat parkways for parents pushing strollers, this is a great choice for families to visit. The park is huge!"
38,4.0,"This is a big park with many options within and around. You can rent a bike or inline skates to ride around, or just stroll around. There are nice restaurants next to the KBS building, or across the big road in IFC and around. You can buy snacks and beverages inside the park too.The park is linked to Han River park, and it is also a great park with even wider options. You can do water sports, ride a sightseeing ship, play at a shallow water fountain. Great for young kids."
39,3.0,"we had gone to Yeouido park to see the Cherry blossoms.  we were slightly disappointed , there were far too many people on the street where the cherry blossoms were. The street was also a main road. Every picture i took of the cherry blossoms  had  50 other people in it.     there was unfortunately also too  many street stalls on the road side which detracted from any beautiful shot of the cherry blossoms. . if you want cherry blossoms, then do the homework again or go to the Busan Jinhae cherry blossoms festival. its better there. one location has a small stream surrounded by cherry blossoms on both banks.  or go to the unused railway station to see cherry blossom trees on both sides .  by the way cherry blossoms only flower for a week. come too early and you see a few, come too late and you see no cherry blossoms. here is a tip , look up the ' korea cherry blossom forecast ' published from February to early march. Yeouido park though is a lovely open space to have a picnic and see the river. or to catch a river cruise up the Han river."
40,5.0,this place is mostly famous for its cherry blossoms. if you visit this place in the beginning to spring you will be able to see the beautiful cherry blossoms tree and it is just amazing.
41,5.0,"We went here as a family during the cherry blossom season and the views/photos were spectacular.  This is reasonably close to the Han River and the ""I Seoul You"" sign.  Enjoy!"
42,4.0,visited during cherry blossom season it was so beautiful with endless cherry trees! it was very crowded but worth the visit :)
43,4.0,"It was expected to see the earlysprig flower as there was many promotion of it and banner everywhere in the station.However, though I went there on the second or third day of the season mentioned in the banner but not much flower blossomed. What a pity. It must be romantic and a nice place for couples and family to enjoy the blossom of cherry"
44,4.0,We were lucky to go here and witness the full bloom of Cherry Blossom Trees.  There are rows and rows of cherry trees in this area but a bit tricky if you will go there for a cherry blossom viewing as the blooming of the trees last only 10 days a year.  Go here in the morning as beginning lunchtime - lots of people are in the street / park.
45,4.0,"Went here after being so excited about cherry blossoms.  As many people know these flowers only bloom 2 weeks within a year and many celebrate as they are gorgeous. Korean loves their cherry blossom, not as much as Japanese do, but the trend is increasing.  In this park, do find the atrium and there will be many families, couples, friends playing here. From bicycle, rollers to scooters. You can rent easily but not for very small children. During the festival there are many food stalls and activities, so within these 2 weeks you'll get culture, happenings trends and current local favorites.  Since the event is outdoor do prepare umbrella as early April (when the flowers bloom) means there's rain every now and then and the temperature is still chilly. Best to visit anytime of the day but we do love afternoon as somehow it was more romantic."
46,5.0,yes we love the night lights of the trees with the cool weather and safe to walk by ourselves or by group
47,4.0,The Cherry Blossom trees surrounded the street and its so mesmerizing to view with. The tourists were crowding to have their best spot for selfies and picture taking.
48,3.0,"when i gone here it was sunday and the spring festival was going on that day, that might be the reason why there is people packed around the park and beside the river. i get there by subway and it seem like all off the passengers was going to the this place...really2 crowded with people cycling, families were picnic in the park, children playing kites, couples walking around or just enjoying the breeze (its still windy and pretty cold), group of teens taking selca, ahjumma selling things.if you prefer place that not too crowded, i recommend you to go there at weekdays. the cherry blossom was not as many as at jinhae / yonggungsa too..."
49,5.0,"Went for Yeouido Flower Festival, during the festival there is lots of performance going on here. One of the best place to see cherry blossom if you missed Jinhae. The park is big thus required lots of walking if u want to cover the whole park."
50,5.0,"A beautiful park in the middle of the city. I visited Yeouido Park in spring 2017. There were beautiful cherry blossoms everywhere. You can go for walks, rent a bike or skate through the park. My husband and I rented a tandem bike and we found that it's the best way to get around the park. We managed to cover the entire park in a short time and it was not tiring either. The park facilities were also very good - there were a lot of public toilets around the area. You may also find the King Sejong statue at this park."
51,5.0,This is best to go to during Sakura/Cherry Blossom season because there was nothing much to see after that.
52,4.0,"We walked the area to view blossoming trees but the week we were there only a few trees were in bloom.  The blossoms came out the week after we were there.  The trees in bloom were beautiful, as well as many other flowering bushes."
53,5.0,"i love this place too.Very nice organised park.We rented a bicycle and cycle around the park.But on my visiting day, the flower has not fully bloom.......:("
54,4.0,Went to this park on 3rd April with hopes to see cherry blossoms however only a handful of trees have bloomed. There were pretty flowers around and a nice small playground. A nice park for a stroll.
55,5.0,Went to this park in April during cherry blossom period... very good and beautiful cherry bloom :) really has a great feeling and i really enjoy it very much ;) It a MUST GO/SEE during cherry blossom period
56,5.0,"Most beautiful during spring when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom. A nice park, where a lot of activities going on at all time of the day. Connected to the Hangang so visitors could enjoy the view of the river as well."
57,5.0,Don't forget to take the picture as you can see there are so many trees there. I love the scenery and it was good to have picnic there.
58,4.0,"On its own island on the Han River, the train ride from Seoul Central was less than 20 minutes for you to enjoy outdoor skating and sled. Great for kids to let go steam in the middle of winter"
59,4.0,"Visited the park during early winter. There was even ice skating rink ! However, if you're going at the period with no snow and no cherry blossom, I'll totally skip this park in my itinerary."
60,3.0,"I visited here with a friend in April to check out all the pretty cherry blossoms. However, it was very hard to find parking and it was crowded with local people. Before I was able to enjoy all the cherry blossoms, I was blocked my people and street food carts that were everywhere. It was not visually pleasing to see all these street carts under the beautiful cherry blossom trees. I couldn't take a decent picture because there would be trash and street carts in the background. :( Due to the street food, trashes were everywhere and it was hard to even find a trashcan. I enjoyed seeing the cherry blossoms but I don't think this is the best place to visit if you are just there to see flowers. We ended up leaving within an hour...=("
61,5.0,We were lucky to have visited the park when the cherry blossoms are still in bloom. It was not as crowded as I have expected because it was early and a weekday probably. It's a nice place to walk around or stay for an afternoon picnic with your friends/family.
62,4.0,"Yeouido Park is a big park with nice scenery. Rented a bicycle and cycle along Hangang River. To go here, take subway to Yeouido Station (Line 9) Exit #4."

64,5.0,"Yeouido Park is a great place to take great photographs, enjoy the sea breeze, have a picnic or even jog/cycle around. It is also very accessible via the metro (alight at Yeouinaru station, Seoul Subway Line 5)"
65,5.0,"We arrived in the park about two hours before sunset and it was amazing!  We started the afternoon at the Yeouido metro station, explored a bit towards the river and then walked into and down the park, meandering and finding amazing views and cool features we took about 90min and covered about 2/3 of the park. It's beautiful and peaceful and a definite MUST if you are tired from city attractions. Sunset is also a good time for photos there!"
66,5.0,"I went there for cherry blossom!! It was very nice... This place quite far from the subways, but anyways you can walk around 5 mins."
67,4.0,"It is where you can the lots cherry blossoms in Seoul. I came here in the second week of the April, so lucky that still have cherry blossom for me. It's the first time to see it. It's so amazing. But I didn't stay long cuz it was so crowded :("
68,5.0,"I took MRT and went a walk go to here. I found this festival in Korea's information page and wow, very wonderful and beautiful. Many people inside to see and take pic here. Koreans and foreigners very crowed. It's the first time to see sakura, so good feeling!"
69,5.0,"Although not too much areas where you can find some shade, the park along Han river is an excellent place to cool off. We liked the swimming areas a lot. Not deep, so safe for the children, but still fun walking   down the stream and wading in the pool was fun. The park is big. Bike rental is a good option to explore the entire area."
70,5.0,Great time to come to this park is in the Spring during the cherry blossom festival or the putkot festival.
71,5.0,This is a very nice park with great views! Great nature feel in the city. The Cherry Blossoms are very pretty.
72,5.0,"It's the closest park to my hotel so it becomes my regular morning stroll place. Surprisingly it's quite nice with good trail, views, pond, a Korean garden, food massage stone trail, etc. All of us enjoy so much here."
73,5.0,"plenty of cherry trees bloom in late march. definitely worth a visit in that period, i wouldn't know about the rest of the year as there's not much else to do."

75,4.0,We were there at the end of the Cherry Blossom Festival and that itself made the whole experience memorable.
76,5.0,"The walk around the park and subsequent avenues during cherry blossom season is like none other. It is full of camera-toting locals and foreigners, couples and elderly, all out for strolls to view the magnificent cherry blossoms in the height of their glory.There are food vendors set up (at least on the weekends) and entertainment such as jugglers, fire sticks (poi) and face painting for kids and adults alike.This is a place to see more selfie sticks than you know what to do with!Highly recommended to see this in early April during cherry blossom time."
77,3.0,"I went there during the cherry blossom season and it was very crowded with many tourists and tour bus.  Overall, we enjoyed a nice walk under all the beautiful cheery blossom trees."
78,5.0,"Nice park for a walk, biking or playing in the grass. Across the street is the water area which is an awsome setup but not much shade. Bring an umbrella. Food trucks are where open at 6 along the river."
79,5.0,"We went there in the early morning that cherry blossom was all over everywhere. Not much people in the park! we walked along and enjoy the sunshine with those pretty flowers. If you plan to visit Korea in April, Yeouido definitely is one place must go!"
80,4.0,"The Park is situated  between high-rise buildings. For me,  it  was a refuge during a stressful day in the city.We went here to see the cherry blossoms. Unfortunately, upon our arrival the weather was sunnier than the previous days. As hopeful as we've always been, we walked from the subway but the trees were already green. It could only be pink, I thought. That's what I saw from my friend's photos just last week. Timidly, we asked a local where the cherry blossoms were, she said it's fallen to the ground-ohhh!Although this is a very nice park to go to but without the cherry blossoms and no time to waste, we could have skipped our visit here in favor of last minute shopping. Lesson learned: ask hotel or a local about things that are dependent on seasons. On the other hand, consider this a good reason to visit Korea again."
81,3.0,"This is where I saw the first cherry blossoms in Korea, there are alleys with cherry trees on each side, very nice place for taking a walk in the nature.Easy to reach via metro."
82,4.0,visited during the cherry blossom period - this place is huge with cherry blossoms trees all over the place. Ongoing event during the cherry blossom period which houses food and games stall along the park couple with concerts as well. Very pretty place to take pictures! Can get crowded thou...
83,5.0,Went there onSunday and it was filled with so many people picnicking in huge groups! Rented a bicycle and took a long bicycle trail enjoying the amazing scenery of the river and flowers!
84,4.0,"I went during the Cherry Blossom Festival in April and it was spectacular. Lots of people, lots of food, and lots of activities. I can't stress the ""lots of food"" part enough. Food to the left, food to the right, and food everywhere! A lot of different things that you can only get in Korea, so save your stomach and get some food here during the festivals. Out of festival time, the park is a nice walk and a pretty place to visit. if you're looking for a casual nature-ish walk in the city, you should come here and take a look. There are also convenience stores spread out through the park so nothing is ever out of reach if you're hungry or thirsty."
85,5.0,The whole park was filled with gorgeous cherry blossoms! So glad we managed to see them in Seoul without having to travel outskirts.The park gets pretty crowded though.
86,3.0,"The park is not so great. Next to the park, near National Assembly there is a street which has trees, in the spring season , the trees will looks nice. But it will be crowded."
87,5.0,"We visisted this beautiful area three or four times, because we just couldn't get enough of it. Coming from a country where cycling lanes are pretty much non-existent and living a mountain area which makes leisure cycling basically impossible we fell in love with this river Park. This is the best place to rent a bicycle and enjoy a long ride. Amazing scenic views, a huge area with lots of paths & lanes. There are two bike rentals. One in the smaller park with cherry trees surrounded by the skyscrapers and one next to the river. The staff adjust the seat for longer european legs (which made them chuckle a bit) and there are different types of bikes you can get. Make sure you have your ID or passport for a safety deposit."
88,5.0,"I just wish I had brought more friends to this place and called for chicken while drinking soju and beer. The sunset here is a sight to be seen on good sky days and this place is among my best memories. Go every so often to see the different flowers blooming. That's one of Seoul's charms, always some kind of natural beauty blooming or falling from the sky, almost every month of the year there's something new"
89,4.0,Korea is famous for the cherry blossoms between late April and May if you want to see the cherry blossoms this park is the best place to view them. The park is also very large and very accessible by the subway it's close to the Han River and there are restaurants nearby it's a great place to stroll on an afternoon either with family or by yourself. You can also rollerblade skateboard and you can rent bicycles.
90,4.0,"Our family walked the promenade along the Han River during the April cherry blossom festival.  IT was something to see with the canopy of cherry blossoms that are beautiful as anywhere in the world.  But beware, it is extremely crowded since everyone else in Seoul seems to decide to walk under the cherry blossoms on the same weekend."
91,3.0,This park is little old and don't offer much views; it is nice to take a walk but don't recommend as a tourist place. It is nice to see the cherry blossoms during spring but there are always too many people walking around (from countryside of Korea) and honestly It is better to visit Hangang park if you are looking for a break .
92,3.0,"During our visit, the cherry blossom trees were only starting to bloom. It made for a good walk though."
93,5.0,In summer it is very cool and relaxing you can rent a bicycle here or go in a boat trip a long the Han river.
94,5.0,Within walking distances from a number of hotels and businesses in the area. I was in Seoul for a conference at Yeoudio Full Gospel Church and it was great taking a stroll and relaxing in the park after the days activities.
95,4.0,"This is a beautiful relaxing, peaceful park right on the Han River.  Unless you are spending a lot of time in Seoul, I do not think you will want to take the time to visit here.  I hope you will have the time because it is so refreshing and restful.  Take the metro, line 5, purple line and get off at Yeouinaru station and the park will be right in front of you.  The entire park takes a T shape, all along the river and the middle from the river inland.  But the river section is ideal.  Lots of native trees, plants and flowers, walking trials, skateboarders, bikers and benches for resting.  Unfortunately this was not cherry blossom time, otherwise it would be even more beautiful.  As I was just passing thru to building 63, next time I will enjoy and investigate more of this huge park, especially the Korean Forest with all native foliage, and culture square.  If you have time and need a peaceful break from sightseeing and shopping, visit Yeouido Park.  If it is summer and very sunny, a hat might be recommended."
96,4.0,"It's been a long time since I was in Korea for the first time! I was there with my family and it's our first family trip abroad. We went there in winter and the weather was extremely cold!! However, this place was just lovely and cozy to talk a walk. The scenery was beautiful!! It's definitely a perfect spot to go with your boyfriend or girlfriend !! Haha"
97,5.0,"We ensured that we timed our trip during the Cherry Blossom Festival in April.It was packed with revellers but it was soooo amazing!  We didn't visit during the actual days of the Festival as we read that the crowds would be overwhelming. We visited 2 days BEFORE the actual start of the Festival. It is crowded but manageable. See pics I've posted. So my advice: Come 2 days BEFORE the actual festival if you don't like to be squeezed in by the crowds. Come at around 4pm and stay till 8pm. You get to photograph the huge park during the daylight and evening. At night, the whole area will be lighted up in colorful lights. Like a fairytale land!If you are hungry, there are plenty of food sold around this area. At the entrance to the park, there are lots of street vendors selling food. Or you can cross the road and head to one of the many cafes and restaurants! There is even a Bibigo chain across the road (for Korean fast food)."
98,4.0,"It's not a huge park but it has all of the things that you need. It has a jogging trail, a lane where you can ride your bike, basketball courts, and nice flowers. You can also go during cherry blossom season and see even more pretty flowers. It's not too far from the IFC Mall or Han River so you can add that to your day of fun as well!"
99,5.0,Its a place to relax. The locals go there to spend time with their family. Jogging and dont forget the basket ball court. They have 8 basketball court so a lot of space for everyone.
100,5.0,"Is a lot of fun to go to they have a lot of things to do for entertainment from biking and walking trail, to strolling thru the park laying in the grass under some trees reading books, to meeting up with friends from the nearby offices. It really is a nice little park. While I was there they were having the Cherry Blossom festival with live music. That was very enjoyable."
101,4.0,"Luckily, we were able to see cherry blossoms around this area duringbour visit to Seoul. It was quite a long stretch to walk to but it has a good view of the city on one side. We also saw some having wedding pictorials, picnics and a couple of cyclists. Besides the cherry blossoms, there were also several tulips placed along the road."
102,4.0,"Took a walk through the park and enjoyed the beautiful cherry blossom on a warm Sunday afternoon in April, it does get very busy but this does not detract from the sea of beautiful petals, and it is always a pleasure to see so many people enjoying themselves, then strolled along The Han River. Very enjoyable."
103,3.0,"Our first stop for Cherry Blossom in Seoul, but, we found the road behind the National Assembly to be better. It was a long walk from Yeouido Park to National Assembly but well worth it."
104,5.0,"We spent about an hour in this park since it has rows of cherry blossom. What I liked about this Park is that you can rent a bike and explore the whole length of the park with ease. It is also very clean and street food is available in case you get hungry, there is also a place to eat if you want to sit down and enjoy the view. There are benches where you can just sit and stare at the river and just do nothing. I was also attracted to the Tulips by the road side. I will definitely go back to this park in my next visit :)"
105,5.0,"The  trees  are blossoming  and the chance  for great  photos  are abundant. The  trees  surrounded  the buildings and officials  provided  lots of portable  rest rooms. Parking  can be found  but it is tight. Get there  early, beat the  crowds. If possible  bring  your  own  drinks  and  snacks. All in all  if you like flowering  trees  and other  floral  displays  you   will  not  be  disappointed."
106,4.0,We went to Yeouido Park during the cherry blossoms season and park was beautiful with trees lined on either side.Locals and tourists delighted in the festivities and there were street performers who mad the entire experience an enjoyable one...
107,4.0,"Went there this morning on a Sunday. Today April 5, the full bloom of the cherry blossoms has been delayed by mother nature probably due to climate change. Still, those along the road surrounding the National Assembly had a few hundred already in semi-bloom so still was worth the trip. I could just imagine when it is in full bloom a few weeks from now. Wish I was still here in Korea to see it. I don't get to see these where i come from. The park itself is a very relaxing place and the best part for me is i got to smell the scent of pine trees again! Last time i got to breath in these scent was literally decades ago! What a beautiful smell it was this morning! Totally refreshing! If you have the time to spare after you get tired of shopping and going to various tourist sites in Korea, i would suggest a visit here. Very easy to get to. Just as it is described by my fellow trip advisors. It is definitely an oasis in a city!"
108,4.0,"This park is very large with various activities that one can never tired of. On a lazy night I've tried river cruising along Han River, passing the colourful bridges and wonderful night view of Seoul. On another day, I've tried cycling on its rented bicycle at KRW3,000 per person per hour. There were many lively activities anywhere you go. At a corner, there was a busker performing his magic including playing with fire. On another, a live concert was going on, viewed by hand-in-hand couples. And on a quiet part at the river bank, a guy was trying his luck on catching a fish.This is the place to go for relaxing, for all kinds of age, away from the noise of the traffic but not too far away from the city centre. There is just something interesting to everyone."
109,4.0,"Yeouido Park is a large recreational area, a long rectangular park, located in the central part of Seoul. The park is divided into four themes mainly the Traditional Korean Forest, Grass Square, Culture Square, and Nature‚Äôs Ecosystem Forest. My main highlight to this park is for the cherry blossom trees, which are mostly 30 to 40 years old, all planted along in a stretch of about 6km long path.There is a few ways to go Yeouido Park1. Yeouinaru Station (nearer to Yeouido Hangang Park), exit 1, walk towards SBS TV Station.2. Yeouido Station, exit 3, walk towards the National Assembly Building.3. National Assembly Station, exit 6, walk along the path with trees.On the other side of Yeouido Park and is the Yeouido Hangang Park, basically this part of the park is located along the Hangang River which explains the name.For more details of my Korea trip do visit: http://nkikichua.blogspot.sg/2014/08/wanderlust-seoul-korea-day-5-yeouido.html"
110,5.0,"This park is set in the midst of city and government buildings just south of the river. This park, not to be confused with Yeouido Hangang Park, also offers quite a few activities. You can go biking and rollerblading around the park as well to make it more fun. In the spring, it is even more gorgeous with cherry blossoms and other flowers making the park more colorful and alive. There are exercise machines you can try and spaces to have a little picnic at. The last time I went with a friend to just walk around to really enjoy nature in all its spring awesomeness. Another time, my friends and I went cycling and I gotta say, that was one of the best times we had in Seoul just going through the park on a lovely sunny day. We got a bit of sweat on us but all worth it."
111,4.0,"Predicting cherry blossoms is a tricky business and Yeouido Spring Flower Festival is probably the sole reason for a tourist to be at the park. It is popular among locals for picnics and cycling but nothing beats the elusive flowers. It is the only time the roads around the National Assembly area is closed to traffic and in its absence, performance stages and vendors line the entire stretch, with the occasional splattering of photo opportunities with roaming mascots (we bumped into Hello Kitty). The festival extends into the weekdays but you'll miss a lot of the action (not the crowd tho; it's pretty packed through the entire blossom season).Mobile toilets are available It's accessible by train (20-25 mins away from Seoul station) and if you are planning to leave by taxi, avoid the usual peak hours."
112,3.0,We went here hoping we would see cherry blossoms.  We were too late.  It was interesting to see how Seoul looks like south of the Han River.  There are huge modern buildings.  We had a nice walk along the park.  The flowers were in bloom.  Toddlers were brought by their teachers to the park to run around.
113,5.0,"If you love peace, go to this park. And if you love Cherry Blossoms or want to see one. You SHOULD go to this park. The park is extremely beautiful along with the blossoming cherry blossoms. :)))"
114,4.0,We came here during cherry blossom. Wow! The whole park was covered by cheery trees... It was beautiful on the sunny morning.
115,5.0,"Biking in this park is the best, there is a designated bike path and it is a great path. There are basketball courts in the middle and people just exercising and playing sports in the area. The trees and scenery is pretty good and Han River is right next to the entrance."
116,5.0,"Yeouido Park was my favorite place during my stay in Seoul.The Han river view is amazing and there are many activities to do there.Simply, It is a nice place to enjoy the fresh air and refresh your mind ;)"
117,4.0,"I went there in the springtime; I believe it was in April. Yeouido Park is lined up with cherry blossom trees for anyone to enjoy whether kids, teens, or adults. It is hard to explain the beauty of it. It must be seen to be believed, especially in April when cherry blossom trees bloom in Seoul."
118,5.0,"I came here a few weeks ago when the autumn leaves were in full play. I LOVE it. The placed looked so beautiful. We rented biked for 4 hours costing 9,000, and boy was it worth it. In four hours we managed to see most of not just the park, but Yeoiudo as a whole. Really recommend renting bikes an exploring. Ride along the Han River with the rest of the cyclists - lots of silver grass next to the river makes for some beautiful sights. I really hope everyone can see this place during autumn. I never got the chance during the cherry blossom season, but I can imagine it may be as beautiful. There's lots of places to rent bikes, and also roller blades, scooters to."
119,4.0,"one of my best memories in seoul was simply rent a bicycle in the park and just bicycle along the han river, it was during peak summer so the sky was bright blue after days of rain, and the wind blowing from the river made me forget the heat. we cycled passing the public pool and the national assembly, and many other landmarks that we recognised from Running Man :p . a nice and relaxing change of pace from the sometimes crowded areas of myeongdong and namdaemun. i highly recommend to those going to seoul for the first time."
120,5.0,"During April 2013, I visited Yeouido Park and it's the time of the year where the cold winter air is starting to fade and flowers are starting to bloom. Every April, Cherry Blossom Festival is held at Yeouido Park, (Ïó¨ÏùòÎèÑ Í≥µÏõê). It had been a lifelong wish to see cherry blossom, thankful to witness one of the prettiest face of Mother Nature!The annual Yeouido Spring Flower Festival 2013 celebrates the full blossoms of spring in the backdrop of Han River at Yeouido Park. To Get There by Subway, Line 9 National Assembly Stn. Exit 6, walk 5 minutes OR Line 5 Yeouinaru Stn. Exit 1, walk 15 minutes. As one of the most popular parks along Hangang River, it attracts many visitors.

121,5.0,"I just visited Yeouido Park (behind National Assembly Building) on 19 April (Friday) & all the trees were in full bloom! I read that last year the cherry blossoms also peaked on 19 April. My family & I were so ecstatic as the view is magnificent! Very romantic, but it is very nice for family outing too. I know that cherry blossoms don't last long so I think we were really lucky. Not only in this park, but the cherry trees in other part of Seoul were in full bloom too! This was my first time seeing so many cherry trees in full bloom, so yes this is such a precious & sweet experience. There were some stalls selling all kind of snacks on the street too. Come on weekdays, as weekends will be too crowded.But we missed the Cherry Blossom Festival by 1 day, which lasted from 12-18 April 2013. During this festival, you can expect to see many street or cultural performances, and flower exhibitions."
122,4.0,"Visiting Yeouido Park was the highlight of our holiday in Seoul. The cherry blossoms were the reason why we came in April during spring time. We have heard that it‚Äôs not easy to predict when the cherries will bloom. But on this day, the 19th of April 2013, we came, and saw with our own eyes what we had only previously seen in pictures. We were told that the cherries started blooming 5 days before we came. To see the cherries still blooming when we were there, was a lucky day for us. Indeed, we actually saw the black and white magpies a few times at Yeouido, which are known in Korea as the bird that brings good luck. We started our tour of Yeouido Park from Yeouinaru Station at 9 am. It was cool and sunny, and a great day for a stroll. We admired the pink canopy of sakuras all the way to the National Assembly. There are many sakura trees in Seoul, but here in Yeouido Park, there must have been a thousand. We felt like we could walk forever, strolling tirelessly with the Han River flanking on one side and the commercial Seoul skyline on the other. Words just cannot describe how wonderful and serene we felt. We love the weather, the trees, the crowd, the couples, the school children, the performers and the stall vendors. It was marvelous when an unknown group of locals wanted to immersed themselves with us in a group photo. If there is paradise on earth, we may have got a glimpse of it right here in Yeouido Park."
123,3.0,"Blossoms in Korea are a rite of passage: you simply must go out and see their collective beauty. Seoulites love to go to Yeouido to witness the blossoms in full bloom, and it is lovely, but there are a host of other much better, lest crowded spots to see. I prefer the sites of Seoul National University (there is a trail leaving from the main gate where people hike up to see a tree lined street leading up to a temple), and there are many other much more lovely spots all over the Korean peninsula, as virtually every part of the country has cherry blossoms. There are some very famous spots, that a quick google search will help you find, but if you go to virtually any town you will find a lovely hike with blossom trees."
124,4.0,"Quite a few big cities have parks where people can relax and rest and de-stress. Central Park in New York comes to mind, as does the wonderful Kirstenbosch Gardens in Cape Town, but in Seoul there is a strip of garden that is also a wonderful tribute to nature as well as a peaceful spot in which to look at some of the history of Korea. I'm talking about Yeouido Park. Located on Yeouido Island, in the middle of the Han River, and with the towering office blocks all around, this strip of vegetation will take you about an hour or two to stroll through. You can reach it via the subway line 5, Yeouido Station, and exiting from the station it's a short walk down to the park. There is a bike path as well as a pedestrian/jogger walkway, made of lovely springy rubber so it's really easy to walk or run in comfort. There's a pond with little viewing areas, where you're actually above the water surface so that you can, if you want to, drop some crumbs of your lunch for the fish lurking in the depths to vacuum up.The statue of King Sejong, so far only seen in photos, was much larger than I thought, and very imposing and serene. It really conveys the sense of reverence that Koreans, rightly so, hold this ruler in.The grass is untrimmed, giving a spring meadow feel, yet it's also lovely and neat. There are park benches every few paces where you can sit, rest, meditate and recuperate. There is even a small forest.Added to all this is a lovely big open plaza where special events and exhibitions can be held.All in all, if you like parks, and like either skating, biking, running or just strolling in them, I can recommend this place."
