0,4.0,"Nice day out, good fun indoors and out, lots of places to rest, eat and drink. Suitable for all ages."
1,4.0,"Whilst at the beginning I thought it was a little pricey, the number of rides available to all and short wait time made it worthwhile. Only downside was the lack of English speaking guides within the park which made it a little difficult to get around. Other than that we had a great time"
2,4.0,"We travelled in winter, therefore chose Lotte over Everland and it didn't disappoint. As any theme park, there are many attraction, rides etc. It's connected to an outdoor amusement park called Magic Island and the theme park itself is connect to a shopping mall that features theaters, sports facilities etc. It's closer to the city and can be reached easily by public transport"
3,4.0,"Came on a week day but there were loads of people, glad we took the tickets with the magic pass and saved a lot of time from queueing. overall had a great time."
4,1.0,"What the hell is that!!! We enter a ride that has a storyline, its in korean!!! Not a single ride has English announcements or experience!!! As a foreigner its a completely worthless experience!!! So if you really want to enjoy better learn advance korean"
5,4.0,My 2 teens asked to visit an amusement park. Wanted to visit Everland but was quite a distance.  Decided to visit some place nearer to our hotel. Took a cab there and thought that the driver had sent us to the wrong place as we are not aware that the entrance is at the basement. Unlike Disneyland. Went in and there was a long queue to purchase the tickets. There were many students. Luckily the queue proceeded smoothly and fast. Bought the tickets to the park and folk museum. Did not go to the museum so we wasted on that. Spent about 3 hours as there weren’t many rides that appealed to my teens. We bought the so called fastpass in the park so my teens need not queue up. The place was alright but not as good as Disneyland. Need a bit of refurbishment though.
6,1.0,"Visited with my three kids. More crowded than Hong Kong’s MTR Subway during peak hour. Unreal.  They should have a concept of crowd control. Too many people no exaggeration. A basic swing ride took a wait of 1 hour 40 mins (quoted a 1 hour wait which was already unreasonable for the ride) - 3 minute ride. Will never visit ever again even if I was paidIf they employed a maximum occupancy limit, it would have been a fun day for the kids. Instead wasted one out of five of our days in Seoul. Will be disputing my credit card charge for this one to say the least. Left after the one and only ride."
7,1.0,"Average wait time per ride is 90-120mins, even on weekday. Completely overhyped and overpriced. Unless you come in via Seoul Discovery Pass. You will be lucky to hop onto 3 rides for the entire journey.Go to Everland unless you like queuing up."
8,1.0,"Not that “wow” like I expectedPark was not as good as we expected. I was excited at first during the entrance but was greeted with disappointment after a while. The queues for all rides is too long. I waited 120 mins for the hot air balloon which is not that cool after all. While queuing, you can listen to a speaker kept repeating the same sentence on and on in Korean language which makes us very annoying, more like chanting until we found out is actually a greet and bye from the staff when u get down from the rides. No merchandise items were sold inside which double the disappointment for me and my sister. Those plan to visit Korea, this place not an ideal but you can try if u want too. Something similar with Genting Highlands."
9,2.0,"It’s a big shopping centre, with lots of entertainments like kids. There’s really not much shopping. Mostly games & food. It’s not a place for us."
10,4.0,"The park is divided into outdoor and indoor. Outdoor features some of the most thrilling rides and coupled with a few kiddy rides. The castle is one of the prominent display outdoor that you will take picture with. Recommended to buy fast passes as most rides have very long waiting time. There are also plenty of Restaurants inside the park. For very young toddlers, they do have a designated indoor areas for them too."
11,3.0,"Had fun but park was not as good like we imagine. Kids section is fun for kids age from 2 to 7yrs old. My child got bored after awhile. Poor in general is old, makes me thing of the theme park in Genting Highland."
12,3.0,"A much overhyped amusement park, I'd say with nothing spectacular really. Generally great for thrill-seeking teenagers, perhaps adults, and families with young kids. Food is expectedly priced higher than usual. I'd say it's good enough to have been there, done that. Doesn't entice us to return unless there's major revamp."
13,3.0,Visited on Tue 17 December 2019. Waited 1.5 hour for French Revolution VR. They should remove VR when it is not VR. Should have gotten the magic pass for this. Luckily this roller coaster ride is quite fun with a 360 degree turn. Only family rides have shorter queues around 5 to 1p minutes.
14,3.0,5th tallest building in the world. On a cloudy day not worth going to the top of the floor. Fortunately you are able to go to the 31st floor (but have to queue for the access card) where the food court is and the Signature 7/11 is located. Nothing more nothing less.
15,1.0,Nice theme park but not at $50 USD. Rides have long waiting times and staff are super difficult to deal with. You are better off going to a local disneyland or other theme parks at that price.
16,1.0,"Worst place ever, even with a map it’s confusing to go around . Trying to be a Amusement park but it’s a giant arcade"
17,3.0,"We went on a Thursday, wait times for the 3 rides worth going on were 70-80 minutes. It is more aimed at younger children than teenagers/adults. Definitely not a must do, especially if you’ve already been to a Disneyland before."
18,4.0,Our kids enjoyed mainly the indoor theme activities rather than the outdoor as the weather is too cold and windy. Temperature was 1°C. Suggest bringing own food for the muslims as there are no halal food in there. Kids enjoyed most of the activities. The indoor is huge. I suggest you guys starts from the top floor than down.
19,5.0,We took friends here who are visiting Korea for the first time.  It was also our first time.  We missed getting the magic passes that come with your regular park admission so will remember that for next time. We were also here for the big halloween party so crowds got heavier than I anticipated in the afternoon but we had a really nice time! My friend had trouble using her card- won is easiest. Lots of options for food and reasonable lines.
20,5.0,"My 6-year-old daughter and I visited Lotte World twice during our recent trip to Seoul. I must say at first i was worried the language barrier might spoil the fun but it turned out to be no problem at all! Every ride has clear bilingual instructions on height and safety rules, plus all the staff can communicate in basic english. There are plenty of rides to suite all ages, but the outdoor rides in Magic Island are mostly for older kids over 130 or 140cm tall.I would suggest you purchase the Magic Pass for Express entrance if you wanna avoid long queues,  especially on weekends and holidays.Yeah so definitely recommend Lotte World if you like theme parks. My child says it's more fun than Universal Studios and Legoland."
21,3.0,"Its been around forever and if youre a foreigner on sight seeing, no need to go inside unless you are up to ride some in the theme park. Mostly very crowded with kids and teenagers and family units. There arent much alternatives around the city anyways."
22,3.0,"The main attractions were closed,  however there was no notice when we purchased tickets.  Waiting time is up to 90 min,  so suggest to buy a magic pass.  Good for children up to 14 maybe!!  Mine were 14&16, so not really interested."
23,5.0,"We went on 11/9/19 (chuseok: 12-14/9/19). There's usually a 50% discount for foreigners. Coupon usually avail on their website only few days before the holiday. initially we wanted to go on another day after 4pm (with the half-day ticket) but since there's a 50%, we went full day. We r glad that we made the right choice. We went in around 9+. There's little or no queue at all in the morning. We therefore do all the popular rides first. We were even able to do twice on some of the rides. Hours later the queue starts to build up but still we were able to queue within 15-30mins for most rides. We were there till 4pm and managed to complete all the rides that are suitable for our kids aged 5&8. When we exit around 4pm, we saw a long queue outside at the ticketing counter and was so glad that we didn't go for the after 4pm option."
24,3.0,The Pasha restaurant already CLOSE. Thus the only option that I notice is sulbing bingsu shop or bring some snacks from the lotte mart outside. We left early and not manage to finish exploring the entire park since we are so hungry. Most of the staff excluding the information counter personnel cannot speak and understand English which is very sad.
25,4.0,"We went in at 10 a.m. which was the opening time but there was already a long queue in front of entrance. Soooo many students since it was summer holidays. We knew what we wanted to go for so ran to French revolution as soon as we entered. One of the most popular rides. We rode within 10 mins and went on to next one, Pirates ship, managed to ride within 15 mins. We tactfully chose the rides with shorter queue and  could ride many rides for the first few hours. It was possible because I am very familiar with rides and how to go about. If you are to come in in the afternoon, I strongly suggest 2 ways to shorten your queue time.  I am not talking about buying ridiculously expensive fast passes. Something you can do for free. Lotte world uniquely offer 3 fast access  using their own App. Magic pass App. Of course you will want to have more than 3 passes since there are many popular ones but better than nothing. You first need to scan or manually register your entrance tickets on App. Press reserve ride. Each ride opens up every 15 mins to choose time slot. Within seconds, slots will be gone. It is difficult to explain here. Once you try to use App, you will get the hang of it soon.  If you are not very technical person or have slow finger, I would suggest another way. Know what you want to ride and go there. At each entrance of ride, you will see ticket reservation machine. Simply scan your ticket then it will give out next available time slot. Bring that paper at given time and go to fast pass way. Only downside of this method is you need to physically go to ride and scan your tickets.  If your 3 rides are all scattered around, you need to walk around so much. I suggest you to choose 3 rides relatively close to each other. Atlantis, French revolution,  pirates ship and gyro drop are the must-trys. There were 3 horror houses but I didn't try since my 2 kids were too scared to go in. The most popular one was at magic island which is outdoor. It's a shame that you need to pay 5000 won to go in. There are many variety of restaurants to choose from.  Korean, Japanese, Chinese and burgers...etc. Many stalls sell  Lottel world goods and desserts.Lotte world rides can entertain from toddlers to teenagers. They have more indoor rides than outdoor ones. Perfect for rainy days. We stayed until 4 p.m. and rode most of the rides using App and reservation machines. Without a plan, you could wait for hours for each ride so plan well ahead."
26,5.0,"I didn’t do much research before coming here and expect a rather simple theme park. I am wrong. It has all a theme park to offer and more. From outdoor rides to indoor activities. It was a rainy day but we still able to catch some outdoor rides like the gyro drop, spin and comet express. The indoor part is also huge with so many rides and activities. Lots of food outlets. Never out of choices. A day is not enough. One tip is never buy ticket on site. Better to purchase through online site such as klook or Trazy as you can get almost half price. Also don’t forget to visit the museum. Worth a visit."
27,4.0,"It was a rainy day in Seoul and I still wanted my daughter to experience Seoul. I remembered Lotte World was indoor and it would be something she would enjoy. She made little comments here and there about it not being Disney, but once she walked inside she loved everything she saw. Lines were pretty long, but that’s to be expected.  Fun little rides for the kids and little entertainment segments and even a photography section where you can take pics on your own camera making it a photo shoot."
28,5.0,"There are 2 different kinds of magic passes. One is 5 rides and the other is day pass. What I learned today was that magic day pass is unlimited and no need to book. You just show up and enjoy a ride. Important point is that this day pass is only available for the first 100 customers who come to the magic pass stand inside of the lotte world. So once you get in with your general access card, go to the magic pass stand right away to get yours. We were there until 6pm with plenty of resting and eating. But did at least 13 rides. Highly recommended. Good luck and hope you enjoy your visit."
29,1.0,"The park is too busy , it waste of money to go there and pay USD50 for an adult where you are do nothing else waiting in a queue for your kids... also you are not allowed to go outside the park and come back using the same ticket!!!I prefer going to “EVERLAND” instead."
30,3.0,"I was overwhelmed by the sea of people.  I thought my toddler would be carried away with the tide so I had to hold her the entire time. The toddler rides were fun, and the 3 d Dr agon game was fun."
31,1.0,"We got a baby and we have asked if we could take the ride before queueing up and Hans, the facilitator, said yes. After queueing up for 1.5hr, he refused us to take the ride and said we had to get him a baby ticket instead. It was absolutely unfair as I have double checked with him before queueing up, he should have let us know right from the beginning before letting us to queue up for so long so that we would get a baby ticket first. We were treated unfairly as no facilitator or sign has told us to get a baby ticket at the entrance nor at the ride. We actually have bought three adults tickets (which costed more) for 2 adults and a baby instead, we have shown the tickets to him, but still he insisted that we have to get a baby ticket instead. The facilitators there did not check any other tickets but us. :( We felt like we were treated differently just because we were not Korean. We were absolutely disappointed. Please don't go there if you can't speak Korean as non of them understand English properly."
32,5.0,"It is amazing there!My daughter was pleased!We played lots of things, like VR, and take many pictures there. My daughter bought a piggy plushie there. Overall, it was amazing"
33,4.0,"This is one of the most famous amusement parks in Seoul. A trip to Seoul would never be complete without visiting this place. It is located at the city center , connecting to a mall and half of the rides are inside enclosed facility. It looks a bit crowded and I personally still prefer recreational parks in the open. If you are ""afraid of the sun"" then this is ideal for you. LOL!  Could have been better if the instructions were in English and the personnel knows how to speak as well."
34,4.0,"Not like other countrie's theme park this place is located in the middle of Seoul. It can be reach by subway easily. It is connect with shopping malls and hotel.  In Lotte World food is not reconmendable , actually it is expensive, taste not so great.I recommend you have meal in Lotte mall's food court before you get into Lotte World.If you have more than 4th grade they can hanging around and get ride without you.Since place is not that big you can have relax moments. It is safe and clean. Eventhough it is little old but well maintained."
35,5.0,"a hotel with a feeling of a little old, but a kind enough to forget that part quickly. From the moment I enter the hotel, I feel the kindness of the staff. The point is that they are truly expressing their kindness. The pool is old, but it's managed so well that it doesn't feel like it. The food in the Club Lounge was fresh and delicious, and there are no flaws except that there are two kinds of beer in the Happy hour time.The club lounge breakfast was a good combination of Korean food and other foods, and the omelettes in the live session are a pleasure to watch and eat, so I recommend you to experience it. (You will see the smile and kindness of the chef)"
36,4.0,We had wanted to get there by 9:30 for opening time but didn’t quite make it until 11 am. My advice arrive to the mall for 9 - eat breakfast at the mall. We used Govoyagin to buy tickets on the spot for discounted tickets. The earlier you get there the shorter the lines. Our girls spent most of the day in lines. Our 7 yr old  son was able to go on rides for his age quite frequently. There is plenty of space to sit and rides for all ages. Overall a good way to spend the day.
37,4.0,Don't expect disneyland or universal studio class ride. Still fun for family with young children and also entrance ticket is very cheap.
38,4.0,This has an INDOOR & OUTDOOR PARK connected with each other. Though not very big but it is entertaining and we found it better than Everland. 30 minutes drive within SEOUL. An entertaining day where kids can enjoy. Offers an ice skating stadium too
39,3.0,"Good to spend a day in the theme park but nothing more even if you cannot cover everything. We bought the 1 day pass with 5 times express credits. Managed to use most on more popular rides and most are located in the outdoor section.Disappointed that a few exciting rides are undergoing maintenance work. To be honest, been to much much better theme park with fantastic rides.Remember, there is no reentry unlike many other theme Parks. Like those in Singapore, Australia and Japan etc.A good experience but not a must come."
40,5.0,"Excellent price for the day. Love the inside part, perfect for smaller kids while the outside is more suited to te ed ns/adults with the thrill rides. Beautifully kept and clean. Lines flow nicely. Plenty to see and do other than the rides. Friendly staff. Great to do on a weekday while most koreans are at school or work."
41,5.0,"Affordable amusement park in the minddle of Seoul.  For foreigner, please take ticket from Klook...cheapest.I went during summer and weekdays, no hard queue....enjoy park..."
42,1.0,"We went on a Friday after Memorial day holiday in Seoul. May have been the most stupid time to go other than memorial day itself.I paid for 3 tickets on Kloop (ticket collection was far away from the main entrance... A good 10-15min walk after asking 3 different people) and added 5 magic passes to two of those tickets for an extra S$100. What a waste of money. The magic pass system is terrible. Every 15 minutes the system opens to allow time slots to be booked to reserve the ride and skip the queue. It has very limited number of time slots each hour and try as we might, for 2 hours we could not reserve anything. Each time the reservation started... It showed all slots filled/closed about 10 seconds after it opened. Eventually all time slots had been reserved and we had to queue with everyone else. So that was $100 down the drain.We didn't ride any of the popular rides because the queues were 90 to 110mins per ride. We were there for 10 hours (until closing time) and rode 5 rides all day.We thought... Screw it let's pay extra to play the VR games.... But no... There's a height restriction and my girl was 5cm below it. Also, the stupid parade that they run through the main indoor Adventure land around 2pm will section off large areas which cannot be crossed easily or at all (during some parts of the parade). So don't get separated or you won't be able to return until after the parade ends. And all this online advice about going for the popular rides during the parade I found to be bull crap.... The queues were long and getting longer still... While my 10yr old enjoyed it, as an adult - I wouldn't wish the experience on my worst enemy. Only a parents love for his kids got me through this day. Just be prepared to queue. Bring your tunes and your headphones, battery pack for your phones, a portable fan (sweaty queues whether indoor or out), snacks, drinks, and pack light. There are plenty of lockers but they are single use so if you do use them then make sure you keep the important stuff with you. One thing I wish I had was a collapsible stool. You will stand for a long long time at Lotte World in queue after queue. I saw some parent bring a picnic mat for the kids to sit and lie on. She was a local with local knowledge. Food and beverage prices are not super expensive but nor are they cheap. Expect to pay amusement park prices.I wish I could say something nice about Lotte World but I can't. I just taste bitterness."
43,5.0,"Went during spring break with a group of first graders. The kids loved it and me too:) The park is huge and and I think it has enough attractions for little ones. The parade at 2:00 p.m was amazing the kids enjoyed it while eating ice cream. I loved the fact that the park has an indoor area and the outdoor which is great when there is not good weather or air quality. Overall, if you are in Seoul and have the opportunity visit Lotte World!!!!!"
44,5.0,"You can bring your family and kids will like the rides , they have indoor rides for kids below 10yrs old and the outdoor rides for adult atleast 12 yrs old above."
45,4.0,"Came here on a weekday evening, on an ""after 4pm"" discounted ticket, with our 3 y.o. No real crowds, maybe some most popular adult rides had ~15 minute lines, but we breezed through it without spending more than 5 minutes in a line. Looks like most of the visitors are local young adults, so kid-focused areas didn't look busy.  Lots of fun to have for all ages. Only few rides were available for toddlers, but it was quite enough for us. Also keeping in mind just the fun value of exploring all the territory, plus a little musical play they perform, it all comes down to at the very least 2 hours of activities enough to exhaust your kid. One big minus and -1 for the number of activities which require extra cost. Didn't use any of them out of principle, so don't know if they are worth it or not... But entry fee is high enough, I'd rather pay extra $5 and not be annoyed when stumbling into some random place only to be met with ""sorry, this costs extra"". All of them looked completely empty as well..."
46,5.0,"Here are my tips for you to get the best out of your Lotte World visit so you can spend less time on queuing:1.  Go on a weekday2.  Buy your ticket on trazy.com.  there's a special promo exclusive for foreigners which gives you an option to purchase the admission ticket at 16% off + 3 Magic Pass rides + free sausage + 1 free VR attraction for just an extra $20. It is definitely worth it.  There is also an option for 5 Magic Pass rides.3.  Download the Lotte World app so you can check queue times and decide which ride to best use your magic pass on. There's an option to reserve on the app but those are usually gone in minutes so it's best to visit the magic pass kiosk in the 1st flr and B1 (location is in the map).  Pls note that you have to use your 1st magic pass first before you can make another kiosk reservation.4.  On top of the 3 magic passes, you can use your ticket as a magic pass 3 more times.  So you actually get 6 magic passes total.  Just go straight to the ride itself, no reservations needed."
47,5.0,"Went with my 7 year old daughter. For several of the rides we went on we did have to wait for about 20 mins. There were some long lines for the roller coaster and  the boat ride but I was not about to wait over 90 minutes to get on these. Plenty of food options. A great day out, with plenty of things that would interest all ages. Oh and if you pay for the tickets by Mastercard you get 20% discount on the admission price. That was a nice surprise which I did not know about!"
48,5.0,"It was our fourth family hols and this year we choose spring 🌸Since we have been to everland in 2012,so we went to Lotte World by subway and it was locates near to lotte sky too.During spring there was beautiful blooming flower and many visitors enjoyed taking their pictures like us😊We can choose either to buy tickets before 4/after 4 pm.There are long queue for a rides and since we was with our 7 yrs old daughter we just having rides with less queing and taking pictures at the castles🏰Anyone who wanna be here it takes a day to spend family time here and enjoy with kids too."
49,4.0,Beautiful amusement park. We chose to go here because there's both an indoor and outdoor park. My 8 year old daughter really enjoyed the parade. It was really nice. We had a really good time with our family and friends.
50,1.0,"Here is our experience: 3 adults and 2 kids We were picked up at 8.30 from the hotel and taken to Lotte World. The trip took some 60 min and after getting organized with tickets etc it was already 10. We were told to return to the meeting point at 11.20. We all got full day tickets including any rides.  After getting familiarized we realized that there were so all Magic tour tickets available allowing to skip the line. Further more also attendants tickets for adults just following the kids around and not doing rides. Cheaper of course. Our 4 year old managed 3 rides and our 12 year old managed only 1 and had to give up the 2nd ride due to too long queue . At 11.23 we were noticed that time was up and time to return either direct to hotel or to a shopping center. We opted for the shopping center which turned out to be a small souvenir shop.Later on I reviewed what we had booked and paid for USD 294 . It was a whole day Lotte World Package Deal. If by any chance Viator or the tour operator read this, our Booking reference was BR-697267984We were clearly cheated. We had enough other things to do in Seoul so did not do anything about this then. But now thinking back I like to warn others for this..."
51,3.0,"Check in was easy and friendly. Obviously the location is excellent if you like to shop or go to Lotte world theme park. There’s a subway station right in front. Not a lot to do nearby once the mall closes at 10. My friend enjoyed the sauna while my teens enjoyed the theme park. The beds were comfortable but the rooms had no drawer space. Hotel’s bakery did have much but there’s plenty to eat a decent breakfast at the underground shopping (go downstairs thru the Lotte department store doorway)There’s lotteria, angel in us coffee shop(breakfast sandwich), krispy creme(doughnuts), samsong bakery(famous bread/pastries),odeng place that opens before the mall opens. Then there’s the food court at the mall. Take the end elevator to get a great view of the outdoor theme park. I would definitely stay again if the price is right:)"
52,2.0,"Perhaps this is a bit harsh and may not be the case if you have younger children, but if I could have a do-over, I would have skipped Lotte World.  We went with two teenagers and we found the rides to be meh and the long lines not worth the ride.  I can see how the park is popular with locals, but if you have limited time on your trip to Seoul, Lotte World is not worth the time or money.  I would recommend skipping it."
53,4.0,"I have been here a few times and a great place when it’s cold or raining. Great for teens. 110cm and 120cm seem to be the ideal heights to ride rides. Otherwise, children smaller than this will have limited access to rides."
54,5.0,Various interesting experiences & happy memories you can have with all members of your family: particularly with young children. It can be a mini Disney park in the middle of a city of Seoul. You can go/visit there via Metro system from where you stay wherever you're.
55,5.0,This theme park is marvelous for family.  I bring my kids there and they enjoy very much.  The indoor part is full of younger children’s fun games.  The outdoor park is good for bigger children.  The whole family enjoy lot of fun there.
56,4.0,"If one read most if not all of the reviews, you will find a few common themes: crowded, long queue, long waiting hours...... we experienced more or less the same. Looking at it at another perspective, I find this location a very popular spot for locals especially students and kindergartens. No doubt the basic amenities such as toilets are well maintained, so they are clean and functional. Plenty of food stalls and restaurants spread out so one never runs out of options.There are plenty of articles floating round on the tips so parents do read them, otherwise invest in Magic Pass Premium, download the Lotte World Adventure Magicpass app to enjoy a few rides with dedicated time slots. Of course, avoid peak season if you can!Our children (7 and 1+) were enjoying themselves nevertheless, but the waiting time really did eat up most hours, not forgetting time for lunch/dinner and breaks. The number of rides/attractions are sufficient to keep the kids occupied enough that they can never finish all the rides.The indoor theme park can be like a maze so parents need to read the map carefully while trying to match the ride timing so that one would not miss the parade. So it's not just an adventure for the kids/teens, but also quite another one for the parents!"
57,4.0,"It is a huge indoor park with a small outdoor section as well. Reach early as it is not possible to cover the whole park in 2 day. It's was Christmas week so Christmas evening parade was worth seeing. Many VR rides are very good so are the outdoor ones like roller coaster, gyro etc...A must visit place."
58,2.0,"Huge crazy place. A lot of people, huge queue. In fact you will not have opportunity visiting more then only few action cause the time in queue takes about 1:30 hours."
59,5.0,"Its was wonderful experience, i was in Signiel hotel next to Lotte World.First it was easy to reach the place .Second its really huge place and amazing.Third next year for sure i will visit Seoul with my family."
60,5.0,There's so much things to enjoy here good for adults and kids. Everyone will enjoy even on winter since most of this is indoor.The parade is amazing. You should see this when you visit.
61,4.0,"For the winter season, it is good to visit Lotte World because they have both an indoor and an outdoor theme park. If it gets too cold for the kids outdoors, then just bring them to the 4-storey indoor park."
62,5.0,"We were there during the winter. It was packed with people. Can't get into any rides as the waiting line was unending - gotta wait for at least 45mins per ride. Tonnes of kiosks and shops selling snacks, food and souvenirs. There's an indoor & outdoor park with lotsa rides.We got to watch their Christmas Parade too. Awesome!!!!If you want to go to Lotte World I would suggest that you go during off peak season. Then you'll benefit from the rides."
63,5.0,my first visit to the lotte world was great. It has a shopping place outside the lotte world. once in the lotte world. there is 2 section where indoor section is more for kids of primary school level and the outdoor section is more thrill with rides. Need to gear up if going on cold weather.
64,4.0,"Never miss to visit this Amusement park if you are in Seoul with your kids.There are lot of rides, shows and a whole lot of eating options. And not to be missed is Carnival parade which boosts of more than 200 performers singing and dancing as they take a round around the park. The park also stages various themed musicals at their central stage where one can sit and enjoy them.Beware most your time may be spent waiting to take the rides nd be ready to shell out more for your food than it is worth.This park is huge, plan full day here."
65,5.0,Family day out Theme park and shopping underground and all the big stores Must visit The tallest tower for lovely views over Seoul.
66,4.0,Lotte world celebrates its 30th anniversary this year (2019) and there are many shows and nice decoration around the theme park to commemorate that.  The rides are still fun (despite some of them being really old) and insanely popular.
67,3.0,"The warmth in the indoor theme park was very welcome with the freezing cold outside. However, the indoor rides were more for smaller kids less than 12 years old probably. Very long queues on a holiday and weekend. We stayed in an AirBnB across the theme park so transportation was not a problem."
68,3.0,We spent a Thursday afternoon at Lotte World indoor. It is great for the 6&4 yo that we have but it was so crowded. Every ride took a long wait and it felt that rides for small children were all filled by teenagers. We spent US$150 for ultimately 4 rides and that took us 3 hours and all our energy. Safety precautions seemed way over the top (e.g. all had to wear a safety belt in the carrousel).
69,1.0,"I guess because it's indoor there were more emphasis on VR rides and experiences. Not the place to go if you're looking for thrill rides. The queuing time was ridiculous - over a hour unless you have a magic pass. The signs for the rides or the facilities are not clear. I walked a full circle looking for the toilets to discover it was right where I was. The stairs and escalators were hard to find going up or down a floor. Some experiences you have to pay extra for and you don't know this unless you go up to it like the VR experience on B3. They had a tour pamphlet all in Korean with the ice rink in it and we thought it was part of Lotte World. The park staff on B3, with very poor English, so I think she said, we'll be exiting the park and reentry is not permitted. So to sum up. Spent most of my time going around a big circle looking for stairs and elevators to go up or down a floor to go around in a circle to look for rides and experiences which takes a hour of queuing because people with magic passes takes priority so they take up the seats first."
70,4.0,Avoid at Christmastime! Great place to visit but queuing for 2 hours for most rides took the shine off. I don't know how much a magic pass is but I think it would be worth investigating to go to the front of every line.
71,4.0,"Lotte World is a large indoor theme park covering multi stories and including an outdoor area. The rides range from kiddie rides through to relatively large roller coasters that older kids will love. If you’re coming in winter, be prepared to layer on and off if you’re going to be in or outside. Best to arrive first thing when the crowds are small and queues are short - go to the most popular rides first - Atlantis, French Revolution, Pharaoh’s Rage etc. otherwise be prepared to queue for up to 2 hours when the crowd builds up especially in the holiday season. The park is clean and well presented and offers a Disney-eque feel complete with their own Snow White Castle. The entry ticket (we got 20% off using MasterCard) is generally all inclusive (a small handful of rides require extra payment). There is a range of food from local to western. Prices are generally higher than outside. There is a Lotte World app that can book Magic Passes (like Disney fast passes) but we couldn’t get them to work; perhaps they need to be booked first thing. So, suggest some pre-planning is essential to get the best out of the park."
72,4.0,Spend a full day at this theme park. It is crowded especially during this school vacation season. They had quite a wide  variety of rides to cater to the different age groups. It provided enough thrill to keep my 3 teenagers occupied.  They have plenty food options to satisfy your hunger. Good place esp if you have kids / teenagers .
73,5.0,We visited with a 6 and 2 year old - Both hada great time - the oldest went on several rides and the little one enjoyed the carousel and playground. It was very busy as it was close to Christmas so we left before taking full advantage of all the rides and activities. We loved the Christmas shows!
74,3.0,"Today is Christmas eve I expected the lotte world will be very crowded therefore I bought the ticket for my kids with unlimited magic pass but when we try to reserve the ride, most of the hot attraction magic pass reservation already closed, it mean you cannot use magic pass for this attraction. End up they need to spend time Q at normal queue. I regret to bough the pass because is not cheap. For my self self I bought 5 times magic pass and now is 5pm and I only manage to use one still has balance 4."
75,5.0,It was wonderful and amazing. I love the place very creative and colourful. My favourite part was the ice skating. The best part was the parade with all the fiction characters.
76,4.0,Indoor and outdoor theme park. Good for cold weather as you can just do the indoor rides. The museum on location is definitely worth a visit as well. Hidden gem. Quiet as most of crowd would be at the theme park. There are several eateries at the exit of the museum.  The eatery closest to the entrance of shopping mall offers cheap and good food as compared to the other eateries on the same floor. It is small and looks less expensive .. food is good value for money.
77,5.0,"My children love this place, indoor and outdoor park. However my kids is 7 yrs old and 3 yrs old couldn't play most of the game but still great for this trip definitely will come again hopefully when the children able to play everything."
78,2.0,"Unless you’re really desperate to spend money on any average theme park, don’t go. The rides and premises feels old and tattered. The crowds are packed and the queues are crazy long (2 hours) for a short unexciting roller coaster ride. It’s also small with limited attractions. We were bored stiff despite spending a fortune on the entrance fee."
79,1.0,"Very disappointed.   Expensive, a lot of attractions closed and the best attractions cost extra, which is outrageous considering the high entry fee.   Even the ice skating rink required everyone to vacate after only 10 minutes.   Overrated, overcrowded and totally over the most disappointing theme park our family has visited, and we have been to many.   We lost on Lotte."
80,4.0,"Went on a Wednesday morning but it was so packed with Korean teenagers, many in school uniform. It makes me wonder if that was a school excursion or it is a trend to visit theme Parks in school uniforms. We reached there exactly at 9.30am and when the doors were opened, teenagers starting sprinting towards the rides and queues began to form. Not intending to wait too Long for rides, we each paid 40000 won for the 5 rides express pass. The counter for express pass is located behind the famous Carousel ride. A paper band will be tied around your wrist. Just show the band to the personnel at the express ride queue and they will mark on the wrist band. Choose to use the wrist band wisely. Some rides have queues that move quite fast. Eg the pirate ship ride which allows 60 riders or more per rid, so one should not use the wrist band here. The express pass is really useful for rides that have queues up to 1h Long. Atlantis and French Revolution have Super Long queues and these are reall high intensity fun rides! Use your express pass here! Gyro Swing is another ride which has ridiculously Long queue. Don’t forget to go to level 2/3 where there is a photography area with many feature walls to take nice instragammable photos"
81,4.0,"The theme park is not big but it has all the rides and facilities. Most rides are for older child with height more than 110cm. We spent some time studying the  floor maps because the signage was not very clear. It was long queue during winter. We tried to use the magic pass but some rides did not accept the pass. Anyway, all of us were having great fun there. The parade was not very interesting. We were confused about the direction to get there initially because the area was a combination of mall, hotel and park. No signage to show us how to go to theme park from sunway. The exit of the subway is 1 or 2. And the park was located near the food departmental store."
82,4.0,"What a fun day at Lotte World! So many rides and lots to see. It is difficult to navigate around. There is so much packed in that you don't see all the rides unless you go down every street and every corner. It is really tough to find the stairs or escalators as well. Lines aren't long but the wait to get on a ride takes forever. They could introduce more efficientcy by counting passengers while the ride runs and limiting the number of Magic Passes allowed on a ride. We went on a Monday and not a super busy day, but wait times were 45-60 for the more popular rides."
83,5.0,"Our two boys had so much fun in Lotte World. It was Halloween themed - The Virus. Rides such as Gyro Drop,Pirate Ship, Sinbad were fun. We had ice cream and hotdogs! Best of all, we had fun at the VR area. We oldies simulated hang  gliding while the two boys took several turns with their war games. Best to go to Lotte World when it opens at 9:30 a.m. get the best out of the trip."
84,4.0,"Park was very gigantic and price is very reasonable. Nevertheless, after several hours of being inside, we started to get bored, as the attractions are mostly ordinary. Furthermore, food is also above average in terms of price."
85,4.0,"This theme Park is indoor and temperature controlled. The rides are compact along The sides since The skating rink is in The Middle. There are about 10 to 15 attractions not including The outdoor Park. The rides are varied both thrilling and for kids. Roller coaster, looks, sinbad rides etc. Good for adults and kids alike. One day is just sufficient to enjoy The place."
86,4.0,My kids were a little young to enjoy the rides fully (3 & 5 years old). The park attendants are quite strict on the minimum height restrictions. Older kids would definitely enjoy more. It has both an indoor and outdoor section so was good for the colder months.
87,4.0,We went here with a young infant so didn’t explore outside as none of the rides would be suitable for our baby. Being indoors meant that we could still go there even though it was a rainy day. Lots to do at Lotte World. There are lots of restaurants and lots of shopping opportunities. I would recommend coming here with young kids although it can get very busy.
88,4.0,"It’s a fantastic place if you’re travelling with older kids. There’s a whole floor for younger kids which we only found later in the afternoon. Queues were crazy on the Friday we visited due to school-going kids of all ages. So if you’re really keen on getting on the rides on a Friday or weekend, do check it they sell fast passes. But definitely do avoid Fridays and weekends if you can. We went back to Lotte World for Pororo Park on Thursday and it was really rather quiet so do consider going on a weekday!"
89,3.0,"If you have recently visited Disneyland I would say don't come here.  The place is small and crowded.  The queues are long and sometimes they cut off the magic passes.  Do not pay the full price if you decide to go. Use sites like Trazy or Klook and get your discount passes. (foreign passport holders only). The kids had a fun time but for adults not so much.  The only saving grace for us was that we did get some nice photos of the kids.  Also, do go early and avoid weekends/holidays if you can."
90,2.0,"My hubby accompanied my mum-in law to the toilet. And my SIL did inform the staff that they went to the toilet prior to queueing. When they returned, they refused to let my hubby boarded the ride, and simply showed us a card that we cant cut queue. In the end, they only allowed my MIL to go up. Separately, we were queueing behind for the second cabin. I asked if they allowed my hubby to join us. again they refused. I told them 4-5 persons are allowed and we only have 4 persons here. And the same reason, we are not supposed to cut queue. Nothing fanastic about their rides + bad service. For Singaporean or Malaysian who are visiting Seoul, my advise is you can give this amusement park a miss. Personally Prefer disneyland and Universal studio."
91,1.0,"Was really disappointed with this. It looks good but that's about it. All the rides indoors are for young children, despite waiting in lines for 30 mins filled with teens and adults. The outside rides are proper rides but a 2 min ride doesn't really seem worth lining up half an hour. For tourists, if you have limited time I wouldn't recommend this, English is also a bit limited here."
92,5.0,"Lotte world was one of the best indoor/outdoor theme park we’ve been. It has so much to offer for persons of all ages. Rides indoors are more for the kids while rides outdoors are for the extremes. 1 day is not enough. Its situated in the city of seoul. other places near it was the lotte mall, lotte aquarium and lotte tower the highest in S.korea and 5th in the world."
93,4.0,"We decided to go to Lotte World since we visited South Korea during Summer time. We were informed that this amusement park had an indoor and outdoor area so we could just choose which area we would like to check.Once inside the indoor park, you wouldn’t feel you are inside an amusement park, instead a shopping mall for the children! Haha true enough, it was airconditioned, which was very helpful during Summer time. There were a lot of rides and entertainment there but we just didn’t have the time to experience it all. We went inside the Fantasy Forest (if i remember it correctly), which btw, you would have to pay extra 2,000 KRW to enter, since our ticket didn’t mention that it was included. No worries though since my 2 year old son loved seeing the various animals that were inside. I think adults and kids alike, would love to spend an entire day here since you could actually find a lot of rides and things to do here."
94,3.0,Had gone with a lot of expectations as a couple of my daughter's Korean friends really recommended it. But its an average Amusement park amd really busy. the rides are decent though have seen a lot better.
95,5.0,"Visited one weekday in December but I guess it was school holidays, it was so so crowded. The kids went crazy at this place, lots of kids ride and the queue was long for each activity. We spent one full day here. We did not play the outdoor activities as it was freezing cold. Hope to pay this place a visit soon!"
96,4.0,This is an indoor theme park which is good for kids aged 4-11 years old.. Half a day will be enough..
97,4.0,"Very crowded on the weekend. My 6 years old did enjoyed it as we changed plan from a private city tour to half city, half Lotte world day because it was too hot to walk around palaces and other tourist spots. I felt the indoor amusement park could have been cooler but with the outside heat and too many peoples inside made the AC seem it wasn’t working well. Lines are long, minimum 30+ minutes wait. Wish I bought the magic pass, that could of save us lots of time. Final thought: been there done that and will not come back."
98,5.0,Lotte Workd is lots of fun. Rudes for all ages. Well kept amusement oark. Fun to see different kinds of rides. Good food. Very friendly employees.
99,1.0,Never ever will I again buy Magic Pass.  You must reserve your Magic Pass at a kiosk or app.  Never worked!!  All reservations for ALL rides were closed!!!!
100,5.0,"I went there a lot of times and I never get tired of Lotte World!There are a lot of attractions and they’re not too scary, so it’s perfect for little childs.It’s an adventure park on the inside of a building so it’s not hot in sunny days.I often go there on sunny days so I can stay in the inside with some fresh air.It’s better not to go the weekend because there are too many people.Every evening there is a parade and I really enjoyed it!I will certainly go back!"
101,5.0,The place is massive. Would recommend to get a vip pass so you do not have to wait in line. The rides are expectacular. They got both outdoor and indoor rides. I would say people at different age will enjoy this place. There are rides that the kids will enjoy and there are rides for the thrill seeker as well. Lots of restaurant and food stalls to choose from.
102,3.0,Good amusement park and the best thing is that most of it is indoors. So you can enjoy irrespective of weather conditions. But seems to have become old and charges additional for certain attractions. Fireworks are indoors as well and are not comparable to what one would see in say Disney.
103,5.0,"Last time we were here was 2-3 years ago, making it as our 2nd stay here. Our vacation this time is longer than our first time in Seoul. We stayed in Myeongdong and Busan first before transfering here. As expected everything is still in tip top condition. Everything is accessible. Train, restaurants, 711, malls and even lotte world which is my kids favorite place to be. Staffs were polite and helpful. Will still be back here on our next trip to Seoul."
104,1.0,The bad reviews for this place is correct. Waste of time and mony 60 aussie dollars to get in and too busy to get on a ride where u have to pay moreeee.
105,1.0,"Visited this week and what a nightmare:Expect :Lines (we could count 1h for the train touring 2mins accross the main square, or another 1h for the baby’ fairy boat’)Non working app ——> useless premium price paid; could book 1 ride with the quick pass on the full dayAmazing food system : want 1 coke 1 cofee and 1 ice cream to have all family happy ? Queue 3 times in three outlets each time 10mins....Indoor park ? : yep but as outside is 38 degrees each client stay in only and A/C was not sufficient for the place and croud !Expectin a day to create memories got a day with nightmare and unhappy familly ... just do not go there not worth a cent (would not go back even if for free)"
106,5.0,"The good thing about it , it has and indoor part that is air conditioned to keep U cold during the day .Tickets are expensive and some rides inside are not included .Great place for kids and adults alike ."
107,2.0,A typical theme park but pretty aged. A lot of walking and not really a lot of choices on food. Perhaps it is good for teens but can’t really compare with Disney or Universal Studio.
108,5.0,This was a great place to take our kids 9 & 13. There’s 4 floors of rides and games. There’s also a lot of fun thrilling rides outside the building that kids and adults will have fun on. We spent about 8 hours here just playing games and ice skating.
109,2.0,"We are not users of theme or amusement parks so not up on the pricing, but took my kids for our sons birthday. Getting in the door is what you pay for with the entry ticket. Rides cost extra - every single one. While reach ride doesn't cost a fortune it would soon add up if your kids are adventurous. I left feeling totally ripped off. Should have researched it better."
110,3.0,there are lots of things to do at this theme park.  it is very loud by my standards.  but  also a must see experience.  I wish ice skating was included.
111,3.0,"Nice place for children, a lots of game available inside and outside the park for all ages .. there is also show from 8pm to 8:30 pm and all games stop at the show time"
112,4.0,"I visited the lotte world around january, but do not worry about the cold weather because this place has indoor area and the game variation is very much from children under 5 years old until adult games are all available in lotte world. many souvenir shops here. the point to take pictures is also quite a lot ... the price of admission depends on the choice of game. if you want cheaper choose a ticket with limited game (not all can be played). lotte world is located inside the mall so if the parents get tired of waiting then it can walk way in the mall..."
113,5.0,"I went there with my wife and 6 years boy. We spent all day here from open to close. It was really fun and lots of things to do. Enough to spend whole day. And if you stay lotte hotel next to it, you can buy discount coupon for all day free pass. Must visit place if you visit seoul."
114,5.0,"Hotel Lotte was a bit old but very well maintained. The character room gave good excitement to my sons; 6 & 8, especially due to its Wii. Service is also excellent. I emailed them in advance to enquire about the beds since I only managed to book non-suite character room with 2 twin beds but they helped me to get a room with a queen bed and a single bed with trundle, which is exactly what I need. The location is indeed convenient from the Lotte theme park which is in the mall next door with a connecting passage. Price is on the high side but with all benefits above, it's quite worth it. Will come back again"
115,5.0,"We spent the whole day in this theme park with 4 kids under 6, 2 seniors and 4 adults. Had a great time enjoying the Lotte theatre shoe, the samba parade which was the current theme and the many rides.There's also a outdoor extension to Magic land. Very decent rides there; I played the bungee and gyro drop. Queue was manageable except for the few games that everyone garners for: Atlantis at Magic land looks like the most popular and Aeronaut's hot air balloon and flume ride were also popular.Otherwise , we had an enjoyable experience with a day at the park."
116,4.0,"I don't know why people say the queues are so bad they could hardly ride!We went early in the morning and went on the French Revolution twice without queuing for more than 5 mins (bad idea cos one can get really dizzy on that ride)I recommend going for Atlantis for your first ride as that ride is by far the most popular. Queue was 40 min or so but if you buy the magic pass from klook you can breeze straight to the front and beat the queue. If you wish, you can use all your magic passes here (prob the best cos the other queues are not as long as this)We bought 5 magic passes. We went on every single ride, French Revolution 3x, Atlantis 3 or 4x, gyro spin, swing, drop a couple of times, Conquistador 4x.If you download the app you can get some free magic passes (these are timed and released every hour) and you could use these for the less popular rides. We never managed to use the free app magic passes for the popular ones cos they were always sold out so we gave up.Enjoy yourselves! The queues are not that bad! But please go early!"
117,4.0,"There are the indoor and outdoor park.I suggest you buy the ticket online (e.g. Klook) before your visit as you can get cheaper price and some package promo (theme park + aquarium + magic pass, etc).Magic passes are very useful to avoid long queue at famous attractions. Grab a map from the information counter to make the most out of your visit.This place took a long time to explore especially if you plan out on trying out rides.Visited here to try the most adrenaline pumping rides (INDOOR: The Conquistador, French Revolution - with VR option, OUTDOOR: Gyro Spin, Gyro Swing, Gyro Drop, the Atlantis). If you have little kids, they will also enjoy merry go round, shows and parades, and other kids-friendly attractions. The 4D Wild Series (indoor) is also very fun and can be enjoyed by all.For cultural buff, they also have the Folk Museum that is not crowded at all (as people prefer the rides) where you can see miniatures and artefacts from the many eras of the Korean peninsula.Places to eat are mostly restaurants and some snack stalls.Aquarium is located on separate building."
118,5.0,Lotte World is huge with both indoor and outdoor attractions so do plan to spend the whole day there. The Fly Venture and Upside down wheel were my favourite rides. Stay for the night parade and indoor fireworks - fun for the kids. Nice view from the 'hot air balloon' rides.
119,3.0,"Good:It's a nice attraction for families and teenagers. The focus inside is more on smaller kids but outside my teenage girl had lots of fun.The park is in good condition. It looks  very safe and well maintained.Negative:When I pay an entrance fee of 50 USD I don't understand why some of the very simple attractions require an extra payment. I found this very disappointing and a little fraudulent. If your staff is sad and depressed as they look, please don't let them wave always their hands. It looks strange to me if some is waving the hands to me and looking depressed."
120,4.0,the park is old you can see it with some of the rides but well maintained a protion is indoor which is wonderful on a sunny day and there is also a outdoor portion where the more extreme and newer ride is located.
121,5.0,"You can kill 2 duck with one shot.Get to Lotte World and you can get to the top at 555m and see Seoul from different angles. Also the entire district around it is one kind ... you'll see it.Also enjoy a complete different shopping experience , good food court even an aquarium if you fancy to submerge.A bit far if you're staying at Seoul downtown but defo it worth it.Don't forget to download Citymaper at your app store and enjoy."
122,4.0,"We went on a Monday and arrived slightly before 10am.  Stayed right through to 5+pm. Tips : entrance tickets :for foreign visitors, i think its better to purchase the entrance tickets online/before hand - we got our tickets at SGD36 per person (adult or child alike).  redemption is at the south gate -- look for the counter that says overseas admission.  it is not the ticket counter that is outside,  it is located after the main doors.Magic passi contemplated purchasing the tickets that comes with magic pass but decided not too and didn't regret my choice.- as we arrived fairly early on a monday morning - crowds were thin - didn't have to wait more than 15 mins in the morning.- we downloaded the Lotte World App - the app gives u 3 free magic passes per ticketholder! - we managed to redeem 2 of the 3 magic passesCrowd - after 2pm - the crowds started to stream in - and that's when the queue starts to form especially for popular rides like the FLUME ride.- so for the popular rides, u may wish to redeem your magic pass early. we didn't know that and when we tried to redeem our 3rd magic pass in the afternoon for the popular ride -- the reservation has closed.  so please note!overall - my child enjoyed the rides - especially the VR rides and had a fun time - for the price we paid - i thought it was worth it!"
123,3.0,"Indoor rides are limited as 3 popular rides were closed down with no reason provided. Inconsistent with the staff service as some staff require tourists to present entrance pass documents before getting on the rides. One of the level 2 rides, the staff pushed my son away and dropped him on the ground for refusal entry when the passes were with my hubby in another ride with my daughter. I found this attitude and service quite bad as a two yr-old child was excited for the ride and being treated in this manner. Not as if the ride having long Q. I explained that we will show the pass tickets later after the ride as my child is crying with  disappointment after such treatment."
124,5.0,"Love this shopping mall, went during a cold winter, u can basically find anything there. Parking is pricey. Lotte mart i outstanding."
125,5.0,"I bought ticket from Klook for Lotte World Aquarium and Lotte World Adventure both we had an enjoyable experience although the theme park seems already dated as some paints were peeling off, but overall it was greatWe super enjoyed the photo booths at level 4 of the theme park as it has different themes in each block"
126,4.0,Was there for a day. Good for families and there is both indoors and outdoors things to play. Got to stay for the night parade as its worth it and its nice.
127,5.0,"We came here late Thursday morning and there was almost no queue at all the rides. Think the crowd came in about 2pm or so, however queue length is still relatively ok at 30-40mins. Generally the indoor parts are for kids and outdoor rides are more older kids or adults. We bought our tickets from the internet and managed to cut the ticket queue, however we still need to exchange for real tickets at the South Gate, and only there. Signage was quite bad and it took us about 15-20 mins to locate it. Within the theme park, again signage can be improved as we find ourselves circling around look for the specific rides. All in all, it was still fun enough for us to go around without lunch for 8 hours. Cannot be compared to Disney or universal studios but good enough for us."
128,4.0,"This amusement is vertically huge, ranges from b3 to 4th floor. It can be very confusing when you first reach there. Be sure to get a copy of the map at the info counter after you enter located at 1st floor. I entered by the south gate and arrived at the 1st floor playground for young children. They cater rides to kids below the height of 100cm and there were variety. If you walk further towards the centre of the theme park on 1st floor, you reached the place where the carousel and viking is. There are other rides on 1st floor for older kids and adults. Most rides height requirement is about 110cm. The more thrilling ones probably above 130cm. 2nd floor leads to the outdoor theme park where most of the thrill rides are. There are also lots of cafes and restaurants on the 2nd floor indoors as well as 2 other adventure rides.3rd floor houses another 3 more adventure rides and 4th floor is where the hot air ballon ride is. Well it’s really crazily big and we didn’t have the time to complete all the rides as we were rushing off to the aquarium. Spent a total of 6 hrs there. Study the map, plan your time wisely and you will be able to get on most rides. Magic pass that helps skip queues save time. But sometimes the queue for magic pass can also be quite long for popular rides.Comparatively, I prefer everland as it is an outdoor theme park and there is a zoo within the park itself. Also it is easier to locate the rides in everland."
129,5.0,"After days of shopping, we reserve a day for the kids. We went by train. The Lotto World was huge. It is located in a mall. Find the signed that show Lotto World Adventure. There are outdoor and indoor. Weather was hot so we stayed indoor first. There are rides for whole family as well as children. The waiting time can be up to an hour. kids enjoyed the day."
130,2.0,"Just a regular amusement park in the city. The waiting lines for the rides are very long. There are couple of nice rides, but the rest are very simple and common rides. This place is a one time only visit place. Considering that Korea is an IT advanced country, this is just an old amusement park."
131,3.0,"This theme park was good in many ways, but expensive for what you get. It honestly reminded me of when Pinocchio's carnival went bad. Something is just a little bit off with this theme park. Green monkeys, people in mascarade masks, strange performances. . . The rides are kind of fun but be prepared to wait a while in the hot indoor area. We paid extra to ice skate and that was fun for the kids. All in all this park was bizarre. It's like a strange knock off of Disneyland."
132,5.0,"It’s seem like Disneyland from the outside but it’s more like a theme park.Just a fun place to visit, definitely worth a visit."
133,4.0,"We went with a guided tour, so we were pressed for time. We only managed 3 rides. There is something for everyone, like the Aeronauts Balloon Ride( to see the ""city"",) a ""hot-air balloon"" ride for younger kids. Older kids can go to the Tomb of Death and Pharaoh's Fury(find the hidden treasure). Younger kids can also enjoy the Jumping Fish(escape the shark;jump vigoursly at corners) and boat rides. There is limited space in the fishes in the Jumping Fish ride, so parents who want to accompany their kids, beware of your knees. There are three bumper cars, one for kids, the other for children taller than 140cm. Both only seat one person, and for the kid one , parents are not allowed. The average wait there is 25 mins, while a ride is approximately anywhere between 6 - 20mins. The Lotte Aquarium is a short walk away, and Lotte Hotel is just outside, perfect for families with kids as kidzania is a stone's throw away. Overall awesome, will come again."
134,3.0,"Overall the visit was ok. It was a little overwhelming at first as the place had the outdoor portion and indoor part with four levels. There was also poor description of the rides, hence, you had no idea what to expect for some of the indoor rides. This place has quite a bit of height restrictions for kids 5-6 years old. So if you’re below 110cm, you basically cannot take most of the rides even though if the kid is game for it. The kid would have to take the really baby rides. Good to do some research before heading to the park."
135,2.0,feels just a normal amusement park with rides. nothing fantastic. The outdoor is not siutable for kids under 7 years old. the merchandise store selection is miserable. and you cant re-enter once you exit the theme park. Doesn’t give you the connection like what Disneyland gave.
136,4.0,"This place is full of people. Waiting time goes from 60mins to (240mins for French Revolution VR). It is a very tiring day of waiting as most theme parks are.My tip will be to download their MagicPass app. Go to setting and change the language. Register your tickets. For us we had 3 magic passes included with our tickets. Then from there you can book your magic pass for 3 rides. You can also view the waiting time for the rides real time. Sadly, for us, we figured this out when we were in the middle of our visit, so all schedules were filled."
137,5.0,"Tips: *Book in advanced*Get a “Magic Pass” to skip the long queue. you still need to fall in line though but magic pass holders are kind of priority.*Be there early! Some of the rides close early the Magic pass lane.*Download their app so you can plan what time and which ride you want to do first.* Wear your most comfortable shoes!The best rides (for me though):*French Revolution*Atlantis*Pharoah’s fury*Gyro drop / Bungee dropIf we have more time and magic pass I’d still want to try sinbad, log fume, carousel etc as they have good reviews. But we only have 5 pass and we’re too tired lol."
138,4.0,A great day out with kids lots of rides for kids over 120cm and a fair few where you have to be over 150cm. The place was rather busy even on a weekday there seems to be a lot of school excursions at the park. There were a lot of eateries to choose from and involves a lot of walking so comfortable shoes are recommended. They also had a parade happening which was quite exciting to watch and have a big ice skating ring. We purchased our tickets online which had to be redeemed from the south gate which was a small walk before we could enter.Overall a good day out for kids guess it's Seoul's answer to Disneyland.
139,5.0,We had a very nice day here. It was a very rainy day and we want to give it a try. And we could spend the hall day here easy... so many rides for an indoor park.
140,5.0,"Family with kids should also go to this place. And if the adults do take rides, there are many that suits them as well!Tickets to the theme park are quite reasonable. Can get them at some apps. Do get from the apps cos I think it is cheaper than onsite.There is also a Pororo park which needs to pay another entrance fee onsite. Can’t remember how much but quite reasonable as well. If you have kids aged 2-6yrs, it will be best suitable.Do not forget there is an outdoor theme park rides as well! But this is more suitable for adults and bigger kids."
141,4.0,"My kids were so excited to visit Lotte World...so many attractions for an indoor themepark. Sad that the balloon ride was closed when we visited. The price was expensive for an indoor place, but I got my tickets through Klook.com, it was about 50% off. The outside rides by the castle are mostly for bigger kids. The ice skating rink is so huge! Lots of places to eat inside including TGIF resto."
142,4.0,One of the best theme par the i recommend to visitWhich is also connected to a gorgeous cherry blossom trees parkIt is outer and Inner themed parkIn case of cold weather enjoy the inner ridesBabies under 3 are free to enter with about 4 three ridesOther wise pay 14000W  to enjoy the rest of the ridesThere are two choices all day ticket and after 4 ticketYou don’t need to take food with you as there Are a variety of restaurantsTGI Friday is having a very huge branchAlso snacks are available
143,4.0,"To be honest, I have been to Lotte world many time when I was younger. After 6 years visiting again.. feel like this place is getting old as I am. Some of the ride had light upgrade, a few new ride, but majority of rides are stayed exact same and need some touch up in my opinion. I visit there on Monday expecting little less people than the weekend, but there was so many people 😞, so each ride takes long waiting (of course). My kids had enjoyed I am sure, but for the price I paid, it was so so in my opinion. Not the best place for toddler for sure."
144,4.0,"Lotte World is a really well-made park, we went there with our family on a Friday and it really wasn't that crowded compared to other theme parks.We got the 5-ride magic pass wristband and I can tell you that it is totally worth it! For some of the rides, they let us enter from the exit and enter the ride from there! Overall the scenery was ok but some of the rides had a really nice atmosphere to them, Dragon shooting and Phahoras Fury were just a few examples of rides that everyone in your family could enjoy !"
145,1.0,"The park itself is ok. Not huge but some good rides both indoor and outdoor. Like some people who don’t mind paying a bit extra for “fast passes”, we paid for extra “Magic Passes”. But using them proved impossible. You have to download their app to make “reservations”. These reservations close every time the very few slots have been allocated. For a first timer with young family, we did not realize that we need to literally “stalk” the app every 15 mins to secure those precious slots. And for one reason or another, the navigation is super unintuitive for the first couple of times. Since the slots are gone literally 3 seconds after each time period opens, it’s a race of fast fingers.Of our couple of hours there, we couldn’t get on that many. And as the family leader, I found myself being a slave to the stupid app rather than being able to fully enjoy myself.Would have asked for a refund for those unused stupid Magic Passes if staff could speak more English.Will not return."
146,5.0,The best themed Park in the city. The best thing is that you have indoors and outdoors activities as well as attractions for all the family!
147,3.0,"To be honest, me and my family just roamed around and didn't get to ride anything because of the long queues and we went on a weekday. There was an indoor park for children and the outdoor which we didn't get to enjoy because of weather and most rides were closed at that time. The place is clean and food was expensive as expected from any amusement park. Do we plan to return? No. But my younger sister wants to. The indoor ice skating rink was nice though."
148,3.0,"The location of Lotte world is quite convenient, however the time i choose for visiting there maybe is not good, people is too crowded, every facility needs in-line waiting over one hour. No matter what, there is a huge and beautiful place. Also very convenient to connect to the Lotte mall. Still is a good experience at there."
149,5.0,"Visited Lotte world with my 11 year old pre teen. Booked tickets on KLOOK - got the one with 5 premium magic passes each. Did not regret it one bit. These magic passes are used like the Disneyland fast passes, simply present the passes (indicated on the ticket and struck off once used for a ride) , enter a separate queue for magic pass and board the ride! It was challenging trying to obtain magic passes using the app - the entrance ticket itself includes 3 magic passes - but these are subject to availability. We did not bother obtaining any after failing in the first hour. To avoid the crowd, we purposely visited on a Monday. Got in at 930 once the park opened. Finished the thrill rides by 1130 with merely 5-10 min queues each. By noon the lines were snaking around. But it didn't look too bad - wait time was 15-30 min max. We opted to use our premium magic passes for repeat rides which my daughter really enjoyed! The park was most crowded from mid afternoon onwards. Our favorites were the Atlantis and gyro swing. (We are adrenaline junkies) Unfortunately the gyro drop and French Revolution were closed for maintenance. For the price paid, it was a fun day out! Very value for money. Do not forget to explore the underland - these were the bulk of the VR rides- so avoid if prone to get motion sickness or giddy. Food was decently priced, not exorbitant for a theme park. A large drink and popcorn chicken went for 6000won. Please do yourself a favor and rent a locker - 1000won only - per use - can't open repeatedly."
150,5.0,Great for the whole family. Its great to visit during winter because the whole area is enclosed so it is warm inside. Its have every activity for every age group. They even have a Folk  Museum that every one should visit to feel History.
151,4.0,"Lotte world is an indoor and outdoor theme park, perfect for winter time. Before we went here, we already put in our mind this theme park was not Disneyland so we didn't expect it to be like Disneyland. We bought out tickets from Klook. When we bought, Klook offered the cheapest price (around 27,000 krw) than any other online ticket. We redeemed our tickets in south gate (entered the room for group ticketing to redeem the voucher). When we were there, it was very cold and all of outdoor rides didn't operated. It made indoor rides had a long queued. But for kiddies rides, the queue was not long enough. As for food, we preferred to eat at Lotty's Garden, because of its varieties and price. Rather than the rides, we loved the parades most. Since the parade area was not big enough, almost all children could dance with the characters. Lotte world provides locker rental for coat but we suggest you to bring it along with you, just like local people."
152,4.0,"Enjoyable place to have nice time, especially if with kids. Many interesting attractions are available. Easily accessible. Better to enter early in the morning and buy full day ticket. In such case, you will not need to make additional payments for most attractions and wait less in queues."
153,4.0,"Lotte world is the fifth tallest building in the world and the third in Asia. It'a mall that has many shops, franchise, restaurants and activities. Also you can get you taxe back in the lotte department store 1st floor.It a great place for kids they get to discover the lotte world adventure where you have many games and attractions to enjoy with your kids ...also you have an indoor and outdoor park. So if it's too cold for you outside yoh can still enjoy the indoor one.But if you have a baby like us dont get the ticket entry with games pass get only the ticket for entry to the park."
154,5.0,"The biggest shopping center in Seoul where you will find good restaurant, shops and children fin places... dont forget to visit the aquarium"
155,3.0,"This place as fun, but the inside portion is mostly for children. Also, there are some rides that are not included pass, you would have to pay extra. There is a lot to do and see inside. There is a food court there and several stands to get snacks. The outside portion has some rides but not a lot. The lines were extremely long. If you go near halloween be prepared for zombies to chase you around."
156,4.0,"Lotte world is a half indoor half outdoor amusement park. This is extremely convenient when the temperature goes below 0. Lots of activities are proposed for kids of all ages. During weekend and special days, it gets easily crowded and lines can become very long."
157,4.0,"This place is huge! Filled with anything, you name it. Shopping, cinemas, restaurants, theme-park, jogging park, lake, you name it.But parking is very expensive.Still, worth a visit."
158,4.0,"You would think you should have access to all the rides in the park after you pay huge bucks for the admission at the door, You acrually will have to pay extra to kids rides if you have a toddler. The park is very entertaining and lots to do. You can definitely spend a whole day here. We especially appreciate the huge indoor area during the winter months."
159,4.0,Love the rides & atmosphere.. travel back to dreamland & thrilling rides. Nice food court to have dinner & watch the parade.
160,3.0,Do yourself a favour and don't buy the tickets with rides if you do not have atleast 1 full day.The queues are extremely long and the wait is anywhere from 1-2 hours for each ride. They do have a general admission ticket which only lets you see inside but no ride. They have both an indoor and outdoor area.Indoor area rides are mostly for kids and outdoor area for adults.Well worth a visit though. You can take the subway to reach.
161,4.0,"the largest indoor playground in asia. with various types of games that are indoor or outdoor. providing a variety of food, games, and attractions, as well as exciting performances to follow. very long queue, open until 22:00."
162,5.0,If you like amusement parks or want to give your kids a treat and live in Seoul or stay there for many days I can recommend it as a daytrip. Its fun - some attractions have a hight restriction. Go there with subway if you can as this is very convenient.
163,2.0,"went there during christmas holiday week. not sure if it's due to the cold weather or if it's just the place itself. maybe it's just us. a few rides were closed. those that are open had long lines. lotte world is more of a place to take nice photos. because really it's a pretty place. the parade looks fun to watch. pretty much that's it. the indoor area seems more fun than the outdoor area  the outdoor area is basically just a disney-wannabe castle with some rides surrounding it. when we went there only 2 rides were open. so we felt like we wasted our time there.maybe it's more fun to visit during warmer season. oh, beware of local teens. they have this habit of running around to reach different rides in big groups, and they're unapologetic if they hit you or your child while running.btw note for muslim travelers. prayer rooms are provided at level 3. it's somewhere behind the cartoon network shop. however there's no halal restaurant or eatery. Iron Bull isn't halal. Pasha has closed, now replaced by Auntie Anne's even though a ""Pasha"" signage nearby still exists. maybe the closure is a very recent event. since no re-entry is permitted, the hungry us had to settle for some fries at nearby Deli Bon."
164,4.0,I’ve been to this place with my family. My children really enjoy it. The fly Adventure made them feel very exited. Other game like roller coaster and skate are very good. The food is nice and many choices. Really had fun there.
165,1.0,"I did see some negative reviews before visiting, and I have to agree with the ones about being over crowded. Don't be surprised to wait 2.5 hrs for rides. We spent $200 aud on entry, and sat on one kids ride."
166,3.0,Traffic took almost 3 hours from Jung-gu and the lines for rides inside Lotte World were more than 60 minutes. Navigation for our senior family member was not smooth sailing as the elevator was always full and only stsirs from basement to ground. The place has a lot to offer but the shoulder-to-shoulder guests made it difficult to enjoy during December holidays.
167,4.0,"We visited for the second time as our last visit was 8 years ago when the kids were still small, and we wanted to experience the Christmas parade to get into the christmas mood. As we are not the adventurous sort, we made Lotte World our last stop for the day and bought the after 7pm ticket. Everything was almost the same as before but we still enjoyed ourselves. However, I would only pay for the full day ticket if I intended to get on the rides. Nice to go for a look-see to experience some theme park magic."
168,5.0,"Couldn’t have planned for a better day in the midst of cold February. Kids were happy and smiled all day. It’s super easy to find with public transport, caters for kids (especially younger ones). There is god stalls everywhere and it’s next to the aquarium and shopping centre which can help round off the whole day."
169,3.0,"Lotte Adventure World is a haven for parents with kids 12 and below as everything there is made for the little ones. It is a one-stop-shop and playground for parents who don’t hv to fret about children being bored. However, the queue to every ride takes about 60-70!minutes. For those with toddlers the queues are shorter in the section for tiny tots. The services offered to parents are ample. It is a brightly-lit place with lots of colour but for teens n adults the surging crowds and noise level there can grate on your nerves."
170,1.0,Went there with my family of 4 and most of the outdoor rides were closed because of winter time and a lot of indoor rides were under inspection hence closed.  They didn't even tell the patrons when we bought the tickets! The rest of the rides were either too kiddy even for my 6 years old or the queue was like 2 hours.  We ended up spending only 2 hours there and took 1 ride which is the merry go-round.  Totally a bad experience.  Cannot go during winter time.  This place is also meant for toddlers.  Far far from disney standard!
171,4.0,Very nice place to be with children. However the queue is very long for the popular rides and I think will be more worth if purchase the magicpass.
172,4.0,"Visited with family (with 2 children) during very cold winter of Seoul. It’s very good as there are indoor and outdoor theme park. Indoor theme park is perfectly well during the winter time especially when the temperature outside is minus degrees. The theme park is not very big actually but it’s good enough for you to spend whole day there. It’s easily accessible via Jamsil Subway and linked directly with the subway station. Plenty of shops and restaurants located at the same places. If you’re not a locals, you could get good discount by buying the ticket from 3rd party website which enable you to enjoy discount of more than 40% for the admission fee. We paid only USD30 /pax for the ticket while buying on site, the ticket price for adult is KRW55,000/adult and KRW45,000/child for a day pass. Worth the visit if you visit Seoul with family / children."
173,4.0,"It was winter when we visited and the indoor theme park is a haven of children and parents. Its warm and welcoming and a lot of fun. Also, the fact that full house taped a few moment of their episode here is a bonus!"
174,1.0,"Small, crowded and long queue. Expensive and not worth visiting. Cheaper & better to visit HK Disneyland."
175,5.0,"Lotte World has both an indoor and outdoor theme park, and because its within the city, expect huge crowds at the various rides.  Be prepared to spend up to 2 hours waiting in line for your turn on the more popular, ie, thrilling rides.  Lots of food options available, but I didn't spend much time on that.  Lunch and dinner was a sandwich, and I ate whilst queuing.  The Comet Express (outdoor) and the French Revolution (indoor) rollercoasters will send your head spinning, which is what I came for, and got it!"
176,5.0,"Getting to Lotte World is really easy by Subway. Do take note that if you have purchased your tickets through 3rd party vendors like Klook, you will need to change to a physical ticket at South Gate. The indoor amusement park has a few floors. It has a roller coaster which is quite thrilling. There are lots of rides for all ages but I felt indoors are mostly catered to the younger children.The outdoor theme park is equally fun with roller coasters and many other rides.Rides are free but you need to pay for games.Food are not too expensive within the premises. Do take note that re-entry is not allowed."
177,2.0,"So glad we found discounted tickets elsewhere. The parade for the Christmas season was pretty entertaining. Since we went on a Friday after Thanksgiving, it was not crowded (thank goodness). However, I️ had to watch my children be denied to get on various rides due to ‘their height’ but Korean children the same height be allowed. Yes, the attendant measured the kids but the parents clearly held their children up on their tippy toes or in the air and attendants acted as if they were unaware of what happened or they chose to not remeasure the kids although it was evident that kids were the same height as they stood next to each other. What’s more insulting is that while I️ was directed that I️ can file a complaint at guest services, once in their office they did not understand what a complaint was and resulted to not being able to understand any English. Issue never was resolved. Disappointed my children did not get to ride the rides that they should of been able to enjoy. Although it’s an outside amusement park, Everland was by far better. Due to the cold weather, Lotte is appropriate if you want to go somewhere indoors but it is by far not comparable to a Disney or Everland. The images for advertisement may be perceived as deceitful depending on your interpretation. Find discounted tickets!!"
178,2.0,"if your kid is 5 or less, stay inside.  There are things to do on the 1st floor besides the Carousel.  We didn't find this area until later so we wasted time outside.  Outside rides are for older kids except for 2 rides which were boring/short.  The boat ride was fun but it's too cold in oct to winter. I think if I had to do it again, I would skip this if you have a toddler and go elsewhere."
179,3.0,"It was a fun place. When you have extra time, you can go there. It is not as spectacular as Universal Studios or Disneyland but it could do. Nothing much to say. They have indoor and outdoor area, a few rides. That's it."
180,4.0,"We went on a Friday, to my surprise, it was packed with school teenagers, we literally had to q up more than 1.5 hours for each ride.  Only managed to get on 4 rides the day.   My kid at age 8 was able to play on the roller coaster, but however the q was a waiting time of 2.5 hours. We gave up on it.  we finally ended up playing on the kiddies ride in the indoor area. Which there was not much people.  But not much of an excitement for my boy. Overall we had fun. But very tired legs too."
181,5.0,"We brought 2 kids, age 4 and 6, to Lotte World theme park and they had whale of a time. Although my younger girl can’t take most rides (shorter than 110cm), she thoroughly enjoy the 2.30pm and 8.30pm parade and the magic show at Fairy Theatre. We were there 11.30am - 9pm and honestly, only manage to cover the whole indoor adventure park but for outdoor, barely cover 20%. Will highly recommend families to stay whole day. If you wish to visit the Lotte Aquarium or Pororo Park, please arrange separately as the 1 Day pass for your to enter Lotte World theme park, when you exit, cannot re-enter.I had gone to Pororo Park on 2 other days; 2 hours (this is the limit for the ticket entry price) on each day. The small playground with slide, rooms with Lego blocks and building blocks, Pororo & Friends performance, the big bouncing castle, carousel (only open for small intervals on weekday), ferries Wheel and bumper car are all really fun for both my kids. Although it is more crowded on weekend, the rides are all more frequent, hence don’t really need to queue much. Personally, think my kids had more fun on weekend as they manage to catch more rides during the 2 hours compared to a weekday. And parents with preschoolers, trust me, although it is only 2 hours, it is enough to exhaust them that the kids will sleep early that day!"
182,3.0,"Most of the popular rides waiting time is at least 30-40mins and we went there on a Wednesday. There is an outdoor and indoor theme park similar to Genting Highlands theme park. Do take note that admission tickets are for single admission only, once you exit the theme park, re-entry is not allowed. We bought the one day pass via Changi Recommend website, which is significantly cheaper as compared to the original price."
183,5.0,"Variety of play areas for kids and adults, we visited the place almost near the Halloween, so, they prepare the place for the celebration with great zombies walk in the night. Worth visiting for sure."
184,1.0,"Even though you have premium pass and almost reach on time, you can feel stubborn and arrogant service from young crews."
185,4.0,The downside was just it was overcrowded. Maybe its just because we went at a busy day. Overall its all good.
186,4.0,"We only spent few hours in there in the evening, maybe it was because the Halloween theme plus national holiday, Lotte world was over crowded. However it is a magnificent place and really good fun for children. Worth visiting for sure."
187,4.0,"There are many rides that are better than expected and several that are just terrible. This is a very unique amusement park design and feels huge inside. Highlights include the Atlantis roller coaster outside, Pharaoh's Furry, the night ""Let's Dream"" parade, and the free Korea cultural museum."
188,2.0,"Lotte World Adventure was advised as an amusement park that one should not miss when visiting Seoul. After having paid KRW 26k for the ""one day pass""  - 50% less then the advertised rate thanks to Thanksgiving - it felt more like ""going back in time"" .... it's mainly an indoor amusement park build on 3 floors around an ice skating ring. The place looks old but certainly was great in the 70's. (Wanna ice skate - pay extra...). To make the place a little more contemporary - we are in high tech Korea, right ? - a VR room and a Wild Jungle VR ride was added. The VR ride was not really state of the art, but well done and certainly one of the rides to do. The Sindbad boat Ride was OK, but not recommended for kids. Looking for food, don't be confused. Several restaurants have a ""in"" and an ""out""side. Once you pass through the restaurant to the ""outside"" into the mall, you actually left the Adventure Park and ""re-entry is not allowed""...."
189,5.0,Visited with my daughters on 24th September a Sunday. We make good use of the 20% coupon at the back of Seoul Map available to tourist upon arrival at Incheon Airport.Outdoor rides are limited compared to Indoor rides.  Please try to avoid weekends and holidays for the long long queue that takes 2-3hrs just for a ride which is really frustrating. Overall it is a very good amusement park to spend a day exploring with the family which we enjoyed and will definitely look forward to returning again on a week day.
190,5.0,"The park is very close to train stations & bus stops. We’ve stayed at Lotte World Hotel which made our visit more convenient. They have lots of family-oriented attractions although during our visit the hot air balloon ride was not operational, but nonetheless, very fun & amazing visit.Thanks,CrisYigo, Guam USA"
191,5.0,Not as big scale as compared to everland but filled with a lot of fun activities! The queue was quite terrible when I went there on a monday. Located in the city and thus very accessible for tourists planning to travel seoul only! Bonus: lotte mart and departmental store are just right outside and you may want to buy things there after spending a day in lotte world.
192,5.0,"My 7 years old daughter loved the place so much especially the pororo house. Lotte world is a very good place not only for children but adults as well, you have so many things to do inside. It's worth the money spent. We'll definitely visit again next time."
193,5.0,"A lot of rides for the children. There is an indoor park and an outdoor park. The outdoor park looks fun with exciting rides but we didn't manage to take rides as it was raining. However, there was plenty to do indoors. The rides are based according to heights. We went during off peak so the queues were not too long. There is also an evening. It is easy to go there using public transport, just that you need to walk to bit from the subway to the Lotte World."
194,3.0,"We made the mistake of only buying the general admission ticket as we didn't think it was worth buying the all inclusive ticket with a 2 year old, we ended up paying heaps more as the one area we went into - Kids Zone we had to pay for both of us plus him to enter which was only for 45 minutes before we had to exit out. Really disappointing, also didn't help that the staff didn't speak a great deal of English, so when we did ask about the tickets they had said that it would cost nothing for our 2 year old and what we understood as we could go on 4 rides for free was actually he could go on those 4 rides for free if we buy the all inclusive ticket. Getting between the different levels is also very confusing, the lifts don't all go up and down to all levels only certain levels so we walked around in circles for ages trying to work out how to get to different areas."
195,3.0,"Lotte World is a major recreation complex in Seoul,The great thing about this theme parkit is covered .we enjoyed in lotte park espically my daughter Tammy.The bad thing about it.1-It is crowded and you wait long time to play.2-It is expensive if you compare the price with Tokyo Disney or Everland.3-There are extra fee for some rides.4-It is small and you can go to all rides and games in less than three hours.One of the best thing in this place is show every hour they have show and enjoyed the music and dance.If you have kids you should go."
196,5.0,No need to explain. Kids and Theme parks!!! A day is not enough to explore and enjoy. Go there early and spend the whole day to get the maximum out of your ticket.
197,4.0,"2 days at Lotte World were just enough to do it all ( and with a 4 year old we left a lot of the adults rides in the outdoor park 7 levels of entertainment  indoors, good rides and effects , lots to do , good options for food and drink and something for all the ages Recommended !"
198,4.0,"Our teenage doughters loved Lotte World. A large part is indoor, so very good for rainy days. During summer and weekends it's very busy, so you might avoid those times."
199,3.0,I didn't love it. I felt like I had traveled through a time machine back to the early '90's. The place was a bit outdated. However - my kids loved it AND it really wasn't as crowded as it could have been (I'm guessing everyone now goes to Everland)
200,4.0,"Checked out Lotte World, the mall, theme park, and building.  The mall was a mall, no surprise there.  Some upscale stores, as well as the usual mall type stores.  Decent food court.  The view at the top of Lotte World Tower was really nice, and not too expensive.  Glass floors make it fun/interesting.  The theme park has a little for everyone.  Food, rides, and plenty of entertainment.  Definitely worth a visit if you are there for a weekend."
201,5.0,"During our three day stay in Seoul we made one full day visit to Lotte World. It is total fun park with many attractions, 3D movie theaters and different choices to eat. It is a busy place so I recommended coming early or buy the magic pass. It is normal to wait for more than 15 minutes !"
202,2.0,"In hot summer and school holiday period, avoid to go to this place where long queues waiting for hours for activities! and young kids gathered joyfully within refreshment spots. But, it is worth to note that Koreans are proud to have their own amusement park like the scale of disneyland, ocean park, ... with good management and profit. Also, there is shopping center nearby to escape the heat and the crowd."
203,4.0,Very nice theme park. had fun riding their amazing rides. they have restaurants inside too. kids and adults will love it here.
204,4.0,"Lots of high end stores, so not as Korean, but lots to see. Also contains Hard Rock Cafe and other places more recognizable to Americans."
205,5.0,"Spent my birthday this year here with my husband and two young boys, and it ended up being such a fun day!  The boys were excited from the moment we entered.  It was indoors so it was perfect during the rainy weather.  We went on a Friday, and there were not that many people so the lines for the rides were not bad at all.  I can't imagine how the lines would be on a weekend.  Everything was cute and catered for kids.  There were adult rides as well, but we didn't go on them.  There are lots of places to get food, and we ended up eating at their fancy Italian restaurant for lunch to celebrate.  The food was delicious, and price was not too bad.  At the top floor they have this area like the Alive Museum which was fun for everyone.  The place was not too big so it wasn't overwhelming like Disneyland or Disneyworld.  I thought it was just the right size for a one day visit.  We got combo tickets for the Lotte World and the Lotte Aquarium from Klook which was a great deal!"
206,4.0,"We took the train to Jamsil station and walked to Lotte World. We went on a weekday so not so crowded. I bought the tickets online so it's cheaper, but still need to go to the counter to exchange for the tickets. Indoor is more for younger children while outdoor is more for the adults as the rides are more thrilling. It's quite fun, think most children will like it."
207,5.0,Lots to do. Massive shopping center. Loads of restaurants and cafes. Lots of shops too. Very entertaining - get ready to walk loads.
208,5.0,"I went with family a week ago. I visited many theme parks in the world including Disney world. Lotte world is a way and much much better than any theme park. It is like a dream land to kids. If you are going to Seoul, never ever miss this place!!!"
209,4.0,My son loved both the indoor and outdoor park. It's a very compact place but managed to fit in quite a lot.
210,2.0,"This place have everything! Every type of rides you can find at Disney/universal studios, you can find it here!But a Rip-off version of everything. Do not set your expectation too high and you will not be disappointed. The place is well maintained and food options are aplenty."
211,5.0,"My friends visited with their 2 children age 5 and 7. I was ecstatic when I saw their faces light up with joy as we entered this fantasy world of fun.There was a parade when we arrived and I was surprised at the outfits. I felt like I should have had dollar bills in my hand - making it rain. The dads and guys seemed to like it!The Sinbad ride was exciting and the hot air balloon ride was worth the wait.Everything was worth seeing the kids' faces. They ran from ride to ride in sheer bliss.Arcade, ice skating, rides, food, beer - rides for toddlers and babies and some rides parents can join, which makes great for photos.Might get wet outside in the summer. Get a discount or don't go.Friendly staff and very safe atmosphere.You could spend the whole day here, tire the kids out, and then get a bite to eat and do some shopping. A family business trip could be spent here at the hotel and all day at Lotte World.This building has smoking rooms on specific floors."
212,4.0,"i visited on a weekday and it wasn't very crowded. The wait was around 5 to 15min only. The theme park looks a bit run down. Staff are enthusiastic and friendly.  My younger kids enjoyed themselves very much. Grandparents spent their time at the lotte mart and adjoining shopping  mall. Do note that you are not allowed to re-enter after leaving the gantry. Hence, you have to take your meals within the themepark. Lots of choices though."
213,5.0,"We started early morning, so we had the chance to enter each game twice, it's amazing on weekdays so you can avoid the crowd, many restaurants, amazing hourly parades, fare prices, we finished by 9 pm, my kids fell asleep without bedtime arguments, it's a must on every Seoul visit."
214,3.0,Theme park is more suitable for children may be up to 11 years old and the facility inside looks pretty old.
215,5.0,"It's our second time visiting the park.  There are much more people then before, prepare to queue up for some of the popular rides.  Quite a lot of rides are closed for maintenance when we visited, which is quite frustrating.  The indoor part is amazing and very good for our visit as there was lots of rain.  Occasionally there are singers performance at the indoor stage.  Overall a not bad choice for families to spend half day or so."
216,2.0,Not all that. One of those places you that are cool for an hour. The vendor prices are good. The place tends to be overcrowded and not well managed at times. Do not pay full price! Find a deal online. Been twice and both times multiple rides were closed.
217,5.0,"Lottemart Seoul where I go is in the Seoul station.Just go inside,upstairs and turn right.You can see huge lottemart with lots of goods there..you can try many tester there..food,fruit snacks etc"
218,4.0,"Excellent for young kids, typical theme park adventures/rides except half of them are indoor and air-conned which was just perfect for the hot June summer!Make sure you follow the shows. they are fantastic for 3-7years old (albeit it is weird seeing Peter Pan and Captain Hook speaking Korean!"
219,3.0,"The place are run down and the rides are old as compared to the other countries.  Some of the rides are closed too,"
220,5.0,I am 7 years old and it was a fun time there. And I get to go on every rollercoaster except the one outside I was too small for it. Vr rollercoaster was the best. The queues were very very Long but not as Long as some places like universal studios in Singapore. The indoor part was the best coz it was cool not hot and we went early so going on rides was easy. The tomb of horror was horrible. I was so scared my daddy had to carry me just like a little baby. Now I'm done.
221,3.0,"People warned us that Lotte world would be crowded, but the Tuesday afternoon in June we decided to go was not at all bad. As an amusement park, I believe it fits families with younger children best (under 10). However, it is still worth a visit even with older kids. The outdoor area was more crowded with longer lines."
222,5.0,We went with 3 kids aged (1-7). Although we arrived only after 1pm there was still sufficient time to complete most of the rides. Do note that there is a minimum height requirement of 110cm for most kid rides. Both my elder kids enjoyed themselves a lot. What was great was 3/4 of the rides were indoors.
223,3.0,"We went there as 3 families with young children (aged from 2 to 8). We had deliberately avoid the weekend and went on a Mon but Lotte world was very crowded. My girl aged 8 wanted to try the roller coaster etc but the average waiting time is more than 1 hour. Even for the hot air balloon, we had to queue for 60 minutes which I feel that it is not worth the wait. Most of the time was spent waiting, hence it was rather annoying for us. I understand that there is an app which allows us to book the timing in advance but it is not working that well. Though it mentioned that the next booking timing but whenever, the booking is opened, the app will hang and by the time it recovers, the booking is closed again. However, 1 plus point is that it is air conditioned hence not as hot as other theme parks. (We did not have enough time to explore the portion outside though we understand there are 2 portions to it)For the younger kids, I think they enjoyed the magic show."
224,5.0,My kids really like everything there 5th grader and 2nd grader had a blast!!!!They want to go back there for sure
225,1.0,"Too crowd and long lines, but nothing to enjoyIf you want to waste time and money, this is the proper place"
226,3.0,"The rides are quite ordinary. there is long queues due to tour organiser, there is not a whole lot you can do. the good point is its indoor so the kids can still have fun in a cool air condition area."
227,4.0,There is a connected mall in the theme park. It is an indoor and outdoor park with rides for adults and for kids too. Location of this theme park is just around the city which is in Jamsil area.
228,5.0,"Good to shop here cuz there are plenty kinds of food, cosmetics, accessories, and so on. Especially, very cheap"
229,3.0,"It is a indoor, and outdoor park , with rides, food food and a mall.It costs around $40 for a pone day pass. but for some  attraction you will need to pay more. It did not make sense since we did choose the all day pass with inclusive of attraction. The queue are long, about 1h30. We went on a week day, non holiday period."
230,5.0,"This place / mall / attraction... whatever you want to call it, is very much with everything that you need to entertain your children below 10yo, you can do it here.They have an indoor and an outdoor theme park! Get here earlier because the entrance is a bit much if you come in the afternoon. They do offer a pass where you can jsmust take alook around. Its giod for you just to take pictures!Its connected to the subway, so you can visit at anytime... summer, winter, even in rainy days - still comfortable. Enjoy your time here!!"
231,5.0,usually amusement parks in Seoul are outside of the city. so this place is great to visit which is easily accessible by public transportation. and ever much entertaining
232,4.0,"Lotte World is your world to amuse with all kinds of fun. I was impressed with the ghost house (I don't remember the name), they made it so real that some of my friends were frozen."
233,3.0,"Maybe cos we went on Xmas eve, too crowded and end up didn't manage to take many rides, perhaps only 4 at most.  Our boys from 7yo to 16yo were disappointed.  Everland was better."
234,4.0,"Never pay full price for entry tickets if you're a foreigner. There are a number of ways to get cheaper entrance tickets and we used Funtastic Korea voucher (received 45% discount). Despite it saying need 1-2 days before getting a confirmation email, I received this within 10 minutes (just ensure bookings are open on the day you want to visit). Follow the entry instructions and make sure you take the passport in which the voucher was registered.  Lotte World itself is crazy busy at any time. Suggest you get there as early as you can. Queues can be lengthy. Download the Lotte World app to receive three magic passes for quicker entry to your selected rides (though wait times can still be more than two hours). The five year old loved his age appropriate rides. Yes, there is a height restriction and as long as above 110cm, then they are allowed on most of the kiddy rides. They measure you pretty much at each ride (there are a few allowing 90cm)."
235,5.0,"Lotte World really IS the Korean version of Disneyland, and it has a lot of options to minimize the waiting.  You can download the smart phone app (Lotte World Adventure), scan your tickets with your phone's camera, and reserve three Magic Passes (per ticket).  It is mostly in English (just agree to the usual legalese in Korean to open).  When you choose your ride, it will show you the next time available for the Magic Pass.  Maps are available in many languages, so English-speakers can manage just fine.  There is an extensive selection of indoor attractions with additional rides outside.  The castle and most of the thrill rides are outside.  There was a nice balance between virtual rides that offer safe thrills (Fly Venture, Wild Valley, Wild Wing, etc.)  and traditional rides like the log flume, several roller coaters, etc.  Some hybrid rides like French Revolution were too much for me.  We did this when it was cold and rainy, so the indoor location was perfect.You can eat cheaply at the Lotteria (fast food burgers, chicken nuggets, etc,) or eat at a nice local-style restaurant.  There is a variety to choose from with a broad range of prices.  The shows are cute and popular, but be sure to check the times.  Some only run twice a day, while other shows and parades run more frequently.  Pick up the Times Guide.If you still can't decide if it is a good fit for your family, review the rides and shows online (or in the free app) and see for yourself.  We thought it was a bargain for all the fun we had.  However, I would double-check to avoid Korean holidays if you don't like crowds."
236,5.0,We went to this theme park as Everland is a bit far and were not disappointed with what was on offered. We spent the whole day there and only left when the park was closed. Our children love it. We took quite a few photo of Cherry Blossom that lined up the park. Memorable experience. We would recommend it to anyone.
237,1.0,Lotte World charged 3 year old children the same rate as 7 year old children and they were not allowed to ride on 95% of the attractions. The only place that's best for them was the Pororo Park and it even had separate fees! It was highly disappointing and a waste of money. We did not enjoy it one bit.
238,5.0,"Easy to get to at Jamsil station. Book online like FuntasticKorea etc to get discount but book 2 days early. Lotte world is great value with many things to do, kids and teenagers at Magic Island.Its well.laid out and split between 7 floors, b3 to 4f..so spend a day here."
239,4.0,Great place for family to have fun and spend time. What I liked and made it a pleasant place is that they have a halal restaurant and a prayer room.
240,3.0,"Lotte World is for kids. Nice outdoor and indoor rides but if you are a group of adults, this theme park is not for you. I think it's best to go to Everland (out of Seoul). Although it's nice to go to the area around Lotte World because of the newly opened Lotte Sky Seoul Tower and it is also nice to take a walk along the Songpa district especially during spring when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom. If you are staying at a Lotte Hotel branch, there is a free shuttle bus to and from Lotte World theme park. Can also easily be reached by subway (Jamsil station if I'm not mistaken). You can go around the park in just an hour or two."
241,4.0,"If you have been to Disneyland and are expecting something similar then you will be disappointed. However, if you want to spend a day hanging out with your little ones, especially if the weather is bad, then Lotte World has plenty to offer you. If you do decide to go then make sure you get a discount voucher (available from most hotel lobbies/concierge) - you will find that a 20 percent discount will be offered. Getting to Lotte World is easy on the MRT. Take the green line and get off at Jamsil station. The MRT signs point you towards Exit 3 (if you go out this way the head towards Charlotte Theatre and you will see one of the entrances/ticket office). Another option will be to head towards Exit 4, but you don't have to leave the underground pedestrian footpath to get to the entrance/ticket office.It's not obvious, as it doesn't stipulate in English, but a Day Pass ticket entitles you to 3 Fast Passes for rides (although I'm not sure if this applies for Half Day Passes?). There are a few kiosks scattered inside that allows you to chose which rides Fast Passes are available on (normally within 45 minutes and not beyond). Alternatively download the Lotte World app and register your entrance ticket details to access Fast Passes via your phone. I believe that if you can buy Fast Passes if you go beyond the complimentary 3 that come with your day pass ticket. Once inside it the multi-level and indoor and outside areas require a certain amount of orienteering. Rule of thumb is that the outside area has the majority of the fast/big rides; whilst the inside has about 3 big rides, but mainly caters to the young audience. We went as a family of 4 (two little ones under 7 yrs old), went on most of the rides that the children could ride on (they are quite strict on height), arrived at 1130am and left at 8.30pm. Exhausted. Lotte World tries hard to imitate Disneyland. There are parade shows and a fairytale castle, but ultimately the lack of recognisable characters (no Mickey and Minnie et al) make them unmemorable. So forget the unmemorable merchandising and just go for the rides. Lotte World does not check your backpack/handbags so you are free to bring outside food and drink with you. PS The cherry blossom has just come into season and there are a number of trees surrounding the outside area that make it more memorable than it would be otherwise."
242,4.0,"There's diffferent types of admission tickets.For 6 of us we bought the half day ticket which is from 4pm till 10pm. We were lucky to get a 20% discount as we paid using Mastercard (There are  also discount for certain airlines) We managed to ride quite a number of rides as it was not crowded. The waiting time varies from 5-20 mins. We had so much fun & laughter there.After playing for hours , it's time to have our dinner. We had ours at Pasha, a Halal Turkish Restaurant.Located at 2nd floor. Food was delicious and affordable :)"
243,5.0,Kids enjoy e rides. Its like disney land.Very super cold wen its nite.Kids love them as have indoor m outdoor games/rides..lotte world is very suitable for young children.
244,5.0,"We told our daughters we'd take them to Lotte world on the last day of our Korea holiday as a reward for all the site-seeing we'd  chosen to take them to. I wasn't expecting it to be all that good, but it was actually a fantastic theme park. It's mostly indoors, and there are some really fun rides, even for adults. There are some inside rides that are extremely fast and upside down, and it is a really fun atmosphere. we would definitely go back next time in seoul."
245,4.0,"Really fun, but it was really crowded.We went there twice, the first time we couldn't handle all the crowd and got out after less than two hours. The second time only my sister and I went there, and it was still really crowded, one game queue take one to one and a half hour, at least thirty minutes of waiting.Other than the extremely long queues, I really enjoyed it.Visited in Summer of 2015"
246,4.0,"This is one of the place you need to visit when you are in Korea, it has a lot of rides dedicated to all kind of ages. However a great tip to avoid long queues and crowds is to go there when it is not their school holidays or any kinds of holiday."
247,3.0,"An indoor theme park great for escaping the chilly weather outside.There were many rides but with long queue in lines to get to try the rides.My niece was forbidden to go to a couple of rides, since they have a height requirement, it was so sad after we waited for a long queue.The outdoor rides in magic island,  were mostly for adults, In one of the rides we saw that there was a short queue in line so we asked one of the staff if we can go inside, the staff doesn't speak English well, so it was so hard to communicate, when we were about to turn our back because we do not understand what she was saying, she pulled us in the corner, and with few English words, she told us that she will help us go inside but we should be quiet about it and keep it as a secret. (I think that was what she meant ;) Then she gently pushed us insideWhen we got inside, there was still a queue in line but shorter, only to find out that the ride we got into (The Comet express) was not the ride we want to go to. It was like the roller coaster plus the seats rotates 360 degrees, we were sooo dizzy. We were hoping for a lighter ride but we were thankful to the staff( forgot her name), she did her best for us to experience the thrill.. There were many restaurants and souvenir shops around the theme park.There was also a  musical show and parade of theme park characters. It was a nice experience but i would still prefer Everland to visit again."
248,3.0,"We went on a Monday and didn't think the line looked that bad.  However, there are multiple entrances, so we didn't see all the people.  Even though I had installed the magic pass app, by the time we found a locker and actually looked at the app, the magic passes were already gone for conquistador, the flume ride and the loop.  We went to the little kiddie land and there weren't lines (this is right at opening).  However, any of the bigger rides were already at 45 minute wait.   We were so over the whole experience by lunch time.  It was cold out, but, the lines outside were also long.  I saw one line for flyventure at 190 minutes.  No, thank you.  Lines just ruin my mood, especially when you are with kids and came on a non-holiday weekday.  We also did Everland on our vacation and other than being farther from the city, was so so much more enjoyable for us.  It was not a favorite on our 6 day trip."
249,4.0,"Not much can be said because it's normal, just like any other theme park in the world. Games are fun and interesting."
250,4.0,Very easy place to navigate and the kids were very happy with the rides! Appreciated the option to stay indoors during winter but the lines was massive even on a weekday! Also food options inside was limited and particularly bad coffee. We had a great time and the kids had fun which was the main goal!
251,4.0,"This is an outdoor amusement park with indoor theme park, like Disneyland.The indoor theme park has a few 3D shows, which are very exciting, not to be missed.The queue for the rides in the outdoor park was quite long and we waited for an average of 45 minutes for the rides.Be prepared to spend a day here as there are many fun things to do here."
252,5.0,"Very recommended for a family with young children, baby and also teenagers. Since it separate to outdoor and indoor game activities, for young children and baby the most suitable games is indoor. I also took my lunch at the restaurant in indoor games (forgot the name) since there are many of food kiosk in there."
253,5.0,"This is great for the family to visit, the food is really good and the rides are fitting for everyone. Half of the park is inside and half is outside, which I really liked because if you get hot outside you can go inside and ride some rides."
254,4.0,"I'm going again next week and it'll going to be my 4th time there. I've joined tours to Korea before and every time the weather goes bad, our tour guide will bring us to Lotte World instead of following our schedule to Everland. Cause there's more indoor attraction . It does seems small inside but the attractions were BOOOMM. It is really fun and if you know how to get magic pass, you can literally play everything in a day. Outdoor is LIT too HAHAH cause there's this game called Gyro Drop (free-fall experience). You'll be experiencing zero gravity for 2-3seconds. *You won't know when you'll fall, so take a real deep breath."
255,3.0,"As with all theme parks, it's best to go early. My sister and I arrived around 11, and spent a bulk of our time queuing for rides. Go early, and run STRAIGHT to the French Revolution rollercoaster. The queue there was TWO HOURS LONG. The indoor theme park is likely to appeal more to younger children, with animal mascots and princess/dinosaur parades."
256,4.0,"This is my second visit and we really enjoy the outdoor game! The place is huge and manage your time efficiently ☺️ You can reserve and have the magic pass online  or you must q at island magic (find the red box at center) to reserve therefore u dont have to wait for a game. The next reservation is every 2 hour.U can also purchase 5 time magic pass cost you 35,000 won or all day magic pass 110,000 won. For muslim, they have halal kebab rest nearby bumper car and nice muslim prayer at resting area (3rd floor)"
257,5.0,"this park is human-friendly and lots of fun to explore. nice place for a family to spend a whole day at. unlike the US theme park, you may well want to go again and again even you know those cartoon characters."
258,4.0,"Make sure to go during the off-peak period to avoid long queues for rides.  We managed to take quite many rides and repeated ones as it was not KR school holidays yet. I am surprised with the quality of food was good at Lotte World, although slightly pricey but really quite alright. Do not pitch it against Disney, not quite the same - but good enough.  It will take you one full day - so make sure you have the time."
259,4.0,"We went to Lotte World on the 21st of Dec which was a Wed. We arrived just after 12.00pm. We bought a one day ticket for three adults 54,000 won each. We went inside and were impressed by the color and rides and decorations it looked so much fun. But unfortunately it was really busy, with a wait time for over 2 hours for most rides. We were able to use the express pass app for a couple of less interesting rides but the best rides were already sold out. We left at 6.00pm and only managed 3 rides and saw a bit of a show. I am not sure if we came on a unusually busy day but I would recommend if you are going, plan to be there early in the morning and hopefully you will have better luck than us."
260,4.0,"Went during Lunar New Years Day. Super busy as foreigners (non-Koreans) got 40% discounts. Always research for discounts as LotteWorld has specials. We got a combo deal with the Lotte Tower aquarium. So, we did both the LotteWorld and aquarium on the same day. It's a great in-door park when the weather is not so nice (hot or cold). It's like a mini-Disneyland and it has many large scale rides for adults and children. There's lockers for 1,000 won (about $1 USD) when you get in the park to stash all your jackets and bags. There's some ride you have to pay additional when you get in. There's fast pass type (""magic pass"") system and you can use your phone app to scan your ticket and select rides you want to reserve the magic pass. It's pretty simple and you use one phone for all your family members. If you have children and you are traveling in Seoul, it's worth trying out."
261,1.0,"We visited Lotte World with excitement and high hopes. Our family (kids 11, 9, and 8) loved Everland (outside of Seoul) and hoped this would be a great cold-weather diversion. We went on a weekday when Korean schools were in session, and the park was still incredibly crowded, with 1.5 to 2 hour long waits for major attractions. Most of the park is indoors and was unpleasantly noisy as sound echoed off the walls. My 11 year old was forbidden to ride many of the ""kid"" rides because of her height, but as a parent (taller than my daughter) I was allowed to accompany my younger children. We love Korea, but this is a typical example of the rigid, nonsensical (to the American mind) rule-following that is commonplace here. The kids were begging to leave by late afternoon, and we gladly obliged them. Overall, a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day. I would recommend Everland over this place -- avoid Lotte World like the plague."
262,5.0,"When we were in Seoul, it was freezing cold, so staying indoor was the only option for us. Lotte World has indoor facilities, and these facilities were enough to entertain little kids. We stayed there longer than we had expected and had a wonderful memory there."
263,2.0,"Don't get me wrong, this theme park looks perfectly fun with all the thrilling rides being outdoor.  But, the Q was like... super long!! more than 90 mins wait for the rides, it's a waste of time and money to be there."
264,3.0,"The highlight of this park is that it's inside.  It was nice to get out of the cold temperatures, but the lines for all of the attractions were so long that we only made it on 4 rides the whole day.  If you can find a time when it's less busy, I'm sure it would be more fun."
265,4.0,"Crowded on weekends. Good for families. Look for discounted tickets. I stayed at Lotte World so tickets were really cheap. Don't pay full price. Was there on a saturday - as with young kids, attractions that they wanted to sit were not that long q. However, popular attractions can be 2 hours or more. However, place was safe, always with activity, good food options. Stay at Lotte World to have complete seamless experience."
266,5.0,"Came from Thailand and in Thailand, there is no indoor theme park like this one.The place is really nice, we traveled with the infant of age one year and he likes it.Very good place, variety of activities, loads of restaurants, there is also locker area which makes life much easier.It's another good day!"
267,4.0,Lots to do and the tickets are good value.  However the queues were simply horrendous.  Average of 90 minutes to 2 hours for each ride!  We downloaded the app to book rides according to time slots but there was an online queue too!  My kid did enjoy it and the balloon rides over the whole park is great for young children.
268,4.0,"This is the 2nd time visiting so not much excitement. There are indoor and outdoor theme parks. Went on weekend, the place was packed with local and foreigners. The popular rides are 2 hour queue. There are many food outlets where you can have your meals. Spend a whole day here to get your money worth. The parade at 8 pm. Is nearer than Everland if you don't have time in Seoul."
269,3.0,"As we ( my kids ) now teenagers.We concluded this Lotte World is an ordinary theme park not such other excitement to compare with in example : Universal, Dreamworld or Disney, even just match it to Sentosa Island in Singapore park as the minimum benchmark. Incomparable to common.Outdoor ride mostly closed/no activity, if some are operating the queue line is 120 minutes at leastTo be there Wednesday/Thursday in end year day apparently not a proper day. It is a mistake. Avoid thatBlame our tour arranger...."
270,4.0,"We visited Seoul during the winter and it was a great that there's an indoor park and outdoor to enjoy. Do download the Magic Pass apps and use it of the main attactions/rides.Go ealy as it get really crowded after lunch time. Best rider we had was Sky Venture, there's also a mini museum inside, very informative.Avoide Dynamic Theater.. wast of time."
271,4.0,"With both indoor and outdoor theme parks, you will definitely be able to find a variety of rides suitable for all ages. However, the queue lines were horrendous and snaked round and round at most of the major rides! Perhaps it was a wrong timing that I went, a Sunday, so one tip would be to avoid the weekends. You can purchase the entry ticket that comes with a magic pass to supposedly help you skip the queue and enter through a special gate for most of the major rides . That so called magic pass didn't work most of the time, at least on the Sunday that I went.Despite the queue, it was still quite a pleasant and memorable experience for my family to visit both the outdoor and indoor parks. The rides were great fun and there was a variety of food readily available at the parks. Purchased our first Moo Min there too!"
272,4.0,"This is great amusement park because it has an indoors and outdoors area. I felt that I was in a mall, amusement park, and a city fair all at the same time. I could have spent a whole day at Lotte World. The best part about visiting this place, was the Answer Me 1988 exhibit! It has a lot of curious memorabilias about the show that I was really grateful to see."
273,4.0,"We took my 15 year old daughter here, when she was 14 when we visited Korea for the first time. My husband and her had a great time going on all of the rides together. While I on the other hand had a great time spending the day in the culture museum that they had there. There were long line on the most popular rides, but because we went during the MERS scare, the lines were pretty short anywhere else. I would advise going when the kids in Korea are in school, because the lines are shorter. It has an indoor and outdoor part of the park. Both parts were very fun. There is a small ""alive"" museum in the park, where you can take fun pictures that are optical illusions. The great thing about the park, is that there is public transportation that can get you straight to the entrance of the park. I wish that there were more people who spoke English there. But there were plenty of signs in English too. We had a great experience going, and would definitely go back sometime."
274,3.0,"Found the theme park just ordinary.  Personally find Disney better off than Lotte World.As I came during winter time/ Christmas holiday: the queue was long and the outdoor activity was closed.  Appreciated more if there are more person in charge could speak English or put more sign in English.   Otherwise, it would be a bit trouble some for us who does not speak local language.* TK"
275,4.0,Love this place especially when visited the theme park during Christmas season! The musical parade and fireworks is way too awesome!
276,5.0,"As my children were very young and they don't really enjoy rides, we decided to only go to Pororo Park which is located on level B3 of Lotte world. For 2 young children and 1 adult, it cost KRW50,000 for 2 hours. The place was clean and the staff were all very sensitive to the children and their wellbeing. My kids enjoyed themselves and i would visit again if i were to travel to Seoul."
277,3.0,"Nothing special.  Too pricey.  Too long a queue for the games, wasting time waiting for the ride etc.  Magic island is probably better with more scenic views."
278,1.0,"Signage is very minimal and confusing, limited escalators serving 4 different floors, no clear fire exit - if there is an incident, people will find it difficult to get out safely.  Long queue with 90 min waiting time is normal.  Not worth the money and time.  For foreigners, go to Disneyland would be much better option.  Disney is more professional and know what they do.  Lotte World is just a copycat to imitate but they are not even close in term of Services/people/operations which are more difficult to copy.  Don't bother to come here."
279,4.0,Our children totally enjoyed our 6 hours stay there. Advice to buy express queue to save time. Was informed that we can enjoy all rides at the park however some of the rides need additional entrance fee.
280,4.0,"We went to Lotte World last Dec 24. As expected, there were long lines before you can take the ride. Waiting time is around 60 minutes for a 5 minute ride. There are attractions that you have to pay extra even if you get an all day pass. My 9 year old son was able to get in 5 attractions because of the long queue. He decided to do ice skate instead."
281,5.0,"Impressive indoor theme park linked with outdoor theme park. Inside indoor theme park, there is a Pororo Land, need to buy tix separately but worth a visit if you have young kids."
282,5.0,Most of the rides have a minimum height requirement of 110 cm or 120 cm so it was kinda dissapointing this time as my 4.5 years old boy was a tad bit shorter thab the minimum height. We were not able to try most of the rides but it was a warm and comfy indoor theme park with heaters so you dont have to que up in the cold and you dont need to wear your heavy and bulky winter coat.
283,1.0,"We when to Lotte World last week and it was quite terrible. We downloaded the fastpass but all of it was ""full""...some rides was only available if u have the fastpass. When I was there, 5 rides was in maintenance....Also, A LOT OF STUFF REQUIRE YOU TO PAY in order to ride it...Restaurants there's wasn't that good also..And the performance there was just a copy of the Disneyland. I prefer everyone to visit another theme park, this is just old and bad."
284,3.0,"As per all other amusement parks, the rides are all having very long queue and you need to plan to be there early to start queuing for the rides.  This park is almost exact copy of Disneyland down to the parades.  But still is a good park in Seoul if you prefer not to travel to Tokyo which is the nearest for the real one. The indoor rides are more for the children and the outdoor rides are actually cater for the teenagers and adult alike.  Adult ticket cost KRW52000 while teenagers age between 13yo to 18yo cost KRW45000."
285,5.0,The hotel has great facilities and easily accessible to public transportations and shopping malls. The room is spacious. We were staying on high floors and we had a nice city and scenic View. The staffs are friendly and helpful. My son has lost his bag in a cab when we were on our way to the hotel for check in. We only realized this at 10pm after our trip from the theme park. The staffs assisted us and contacted the driver. Their shuttle bus driver helped us to ferry the bag from Myeongdong to the hotel. The bag was sent to our room the next morning. We are thankful and appreciated their excellent services and efforts. They have the currency exchange services at the front desk. The KAL limousine bus stop is just in front of the hotel lobby. This helps us to save on our airport transfer. The cost to Incheon airport quoted by cab drivers to us was around 120 000 Korean won but the KAL bus ride is only 16 000 won per adult and 10 000 won per child from Lotte World hotel. Their female porter even assisted us with our luggages to the bus stop. We have a great time here and would surely return for our next trip to Seoul.
286,4.0,We went on a Saturday and started off with the outdoor rides.  Just 2 rides have already spent 4 hrs queuing.  Many rides and attractions both indoor and outdoor but the long queue requires lots of patience and self entertainment while queuing.  Downloaded the Apps for Quickpass but it is useless as it is always full every 15 mins.  Not recommended for weekend.
287,4.0,"Lotte World is located in Chamsil within the city of Seoul at a subway stop for added convienience. Proximity wise it is along the Han river beyond ApkuJongDong (on the same side as Gangnam) and near the Olympic park area. I wouldn't necessary stay at the Lotte hotel attached as per my memory rooms were small and beds tiny. Better to stay near Coex at Park Hyatt if not then Intercontinental or further out at Grand Hyatt. Lotte World has been around for many years and this review is mainly for the indoor adventure park which is attached to a huge shopping mall. Across the street (intersection) is the Lotte new world mall; the tallest building.  We were able to get discounted tickets for free use of the park for just about 20,000 won each (around 20 US) by using certain promotional related approved credit cards that relied mostly on LG or other card. You can check with the staff there but basically my Korean host paid for it and I chipped in. On the lowest level is an ice skating rink. On the above levels around it is the adventure park and also folk village (separate entry). Once we paid for our tickets into the park we ate at one of restaurants around the upper level of the rink; found a small buffet called Seven springs which was decent. We then entered the park and spent a nice afternoon watching live performances (there were many and Xmas themed). It made us feel very cheerful for the holiday and the performances were impressive and festive. Especially rock n roll santa Elvis! There was a small gallery within the park that was enjoyable for photos. We did not ride many rides and the monorail we did ride seemed dated. There is an outdoor portion the park but it was too cold to go outside. The mirror maze was fun but a few extra Won just for that attraction. All other attractions were free per our entrance fee. This can be a low-key enjoyable family event and can't comment on if I would just go for the rides there because that's just not my cup of tea. There does seem to be a VR roller coaster (coaster updated with VR googles), various on top of water rides like indoor jungle boat and flume. There's an indoor kids play area which was too packed to stand in line for. The 'balloon' ride circling the park seemed like a very scenic and slow ride more so than monorail. The park has two main characters Lotte and Lorry and they are cute and the concessions cheap enough to wear and have fun with. The folk village is nice to have nearby for folks who want a taste of Korea and history. For a real taste of Korean history go to Geongbokgung to walk the palace grounds and museum and nearby Insadong to buy souvenirs and tea.Lotte mall lower level has a food court option I think Hyundai dept stores have more impressive food courts. The mall itself is affordable to expensive depending on what you are looking for. Lotte new world mall (tall building) has newer stores to shop and a decent aquarium on the basement.  A modern place to eat there on street level is Bills. This entire block of Lotte malls and attractions would like fill a few afternoons of fun and variety needed for everyone."

Towards the end of the day, then we realized that you can download the app and make reservations for the rides. But some people also tell us it's not helpful as most rides are blocked out. Love to watch the parades and X'mas concerts. It's kids friendly, with catchy sounds and lovely lightning effects. Really brought out the X'mas atmosphere. The magic pass is worth buying if one is really keen on the rides. Read up more on their website before going."
289,5.0,"I had grown up with Disneyland since a kid, so I decided to check out Lotte World to see what it was like.  It was starting to get pretty busy around 10 am. There were 3 attractions I skipped because they were 1 hr long already and I was only there for the morning.  Also, one ride was already used up for the Magic Pass option for the day by 11:00.  Magic Pass is basically the Disney Fastpass where you can put your ticket in a machine and get a ticket that lets you return at a later time during the day without having to stand in a long line.  I checked out the 3D simulator rides on the lower level of the park.  Wild Jungle, Wild Valley, were the better of he 3 which also included Wild Wing.  You get placed in a stationary jeep in front of a big screen and then moved around while the featured film plays. Missed out on Aeronauts Balloon Ride which are hot air balloons that run on a track along the park ceiling.  It was a 45 minute wait.   Jungle Adventure is a take on Jungle Cruise, but animatronics aren't great quality.  The tiger looked scruffy too.  The line for the flume ride, which is basically a log ride, was 1hr.  You go through exhibits with dinosaurs and there are 2 drops I noticed while walking by.  I also got on to the boat ride, The Adventures of Sinbad, imitation of Pirates of the Caribbean.  It even started off with 2 drops.  I had a fine time visiting Lotte World, but it does get busy pretty fast.  I noticed this too while at the Disney Parks in Tokyo.  There are more people there at opening than those parks in North America.  Maybe they just like their theme parks more on this side of the world more."
290,5.0,One needs at least a full day to enjoy some of the rides. Anything less will simply be ' sightseeing' and some shopping.Good to explore the museam within and try their authentic local dishes adjacent to the museum.
291,4.0,"There are rides for young & older kids. Less crowded in the morning. Lotte Hotel World guest can purchase Lotte World one day pass at discounted price of 23,000 KRW per person (same price for child & adult). Download Magic Pass app before you go and register the entrance tickets using the app for advance booking of rides, check waiting time & discount for F&B."
292,5.0,"I went with my 8 years daughter and 12 years son. You will spend the whole day. they have tickets options after 4pm and after 7pm. They close 11pm, but some games closes earlier. Read about the attractions and age/hight limits before going. This will help you to plan in advance. You can buy an express ticket for 5 games for 30,000 krw or 100,000 for unlimited. You will buy it after going inside. They have outdoor attractions and indoor attractions, so it is ok to visit regardless the weather conditions."
293,3.0,"The place is crowded even on weekdays , especially in December. With an admission ticket, all rides need to pay and not that cheap. Do check it out if it is your first time in Seoul. For me, once is enough."
294,3.0,"My 2nd visit to Lotte World and this time I booked tickets on weekdays hoping it'll not be crowded like all theme parks. I was wrong, the place is bustling with students and young couples even on a Monday. The queue for outdoor rides is worst! The snake long queue has at least more than 50 pax for each ride. :(There's a queue on almost all the rides even the indoor monorail ride. Be prepared to wait at least 45 mins for a 5 mins ride.  Downloaded the fast pass app and it's doesn't work. The only consolation is that there's a prayer room and halal kebab food in Lotte World."
