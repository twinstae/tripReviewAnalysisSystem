0,3.0,"The location on a hill was superb. It creates an anticipation for things to come.We had lunch there and went for a set has most of the items we wanted to try. We were told that they will need 20 minutes to prepare the food. No worries.Trouble was when the food came, it was not course by course. Salad came with the second course and the third! Plates started to clutter the table as if went to a banchan shop. But Samcheonggak was not. And this went on through out the meal. It was as if they served the food after the kitchen has prepared it, not after you finished a course. It made eating harried and not a pleasant experience.Besides that, the salad dressing (1st) and the pine nut dressing (4th) was so similar in taste, they shouldn't be set so near to each other. Having the scallops & shrimp in pine nut dressing served before we even finished our salad compounded to the negatives.I was not sure if it was the high expectations that made this dining experience so memorable in a bad way.Was it a good meal? Borderline yes.Was it worth the price? Not really.Will we go again for lunch? Don't think so. Maybe for a coffee to take in the views."
1,5.0,"A quaint, well-maintained restaurant/tea house with a great view. A bit expensive but worth it. The environment around is also so peaceful and beautiful it's lovely to just go out and take a long walk after a tea. I love going there every time I get a change to visit Korea."
2,4.0,A nice quiet place out from the hustle and bustle of Seoul City. They have a hourly shuttle bus that pick people up from a couple of places in Seoul. ( Eg. About 20m from JONGGAK station exit no.5) We took the 10.16am bus from here.  Lunch Set cost us about US$60 per head but it comes with good quality stuff .
