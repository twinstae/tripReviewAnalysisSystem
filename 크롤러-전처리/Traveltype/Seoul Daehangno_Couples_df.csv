0,5.0,"Daehangno doesn't usually come on top of Seoul's touristic attraction list, but it definitely should. In such a small district, you can experience different facets of Korea's cultural, nighlife and culinary scenes. On the west end, you have Sungkyunkwan University  (Korea's oldest higher-learning institution) and it's university street, food of shops and affordable restaurants and bars. In the middle, the actual daehangno, which is Korea's Broadway, since it has the country's highest concentration of theaters and music halls. On the East side of the street, you'll find bustling Streets with a vibrant nightlife. More accessible than Gangnam, more authentic than Itaewon, more stylish than Hongdae, it features bars, restaurants, music venues and stores of all kinds. If you head East even more, you'll reach Naksan Park, which is actually more of all small mountain, and offers amazing views of Northern Seoul ; as well as the lovely Indie Iwha neighborhood."
