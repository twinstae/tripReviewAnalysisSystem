0,5.0,Reading about the Shrine in historical books gives you a background of how important it is in Korean history.
1,5.0,"This shrine is plain compared to the palaces you'll visit as part of your combination ticket, but that's because it's meant to be a place of reflection on the lives of the deceased rulers. Still lovely to see the difference as compared to the palaces."
2,4.0,"Beware of the hours -- look it up, but from my memory it's open on Saturdays, otherwise you have to take a tour!"
3,4.0,"Jongmyo Shrine is a great cultural experience though not exciting architecturally. It's a pretty austere Confucian place so the attraction is in the atmosphere and the cultural relevance of this shrine. As such, the guided tour is a must-do. Mind you access is by guided tour only so check out the opening hours in advance."
4,4.0,This is a glorified cemetery. Well maintained and clean but there are other better places to see if your have time. So for me it is just okay.
5,5.0,"Getting is easy. Take the subway to ""Jongno-3"", alight and just follow the sign that says JONGMYO SHRINE or CHANGDEOKGUNG PALACE. These two are nearby actually.Entrance is 1000won, guided tour into the shrine. Beautiful architecture and culture. It's interesting to see how much effort they put in venerate the dead. There is even a walkway meant only for the spirits. This shrine is where all the spirit tablets of previous kings are kept. Even until today there are ceremonies held to pay respect to them. I was not fortunate to witness this though."
6,5.0,"Jongmyo Shrine is a primary place of worship for kings throughout the Joseon Dynasty and has  been registered as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site. All ancestral tablets are originally preserved even we have suffered from wars several times. The more important thing is the Jongmyo Memorial Service is the oldest and existing ritual ceremony in the world. This is not a busy  tourist attraction, but a meaningful and historical site deserved for visit."
7,5.0,"Jongmyo is a huge park in the middle of the city. The resting place of the ""spirit tablets"" of the Korean kings, it is an oasis of green in a busy [but fun] city. I took three US work colleagues here and they rated it their favorite experience in Seoul. Now, definitely do some planning. You can only enter on a language tour for which you speak that language. All Western languages have to go on the English tour! On Saturdays the English tours tended to be at noon, 2:00 and maybe 4:00. Ask your hotel to call or check with Tourist Information. The cost is low. This site is near the subway and is convenient to a couple of the royal places. I've been thrice and all three tour guides spoke good English and well amazingly well-ifnormed. This is a great place to learn some Korean history and Confucian culture. Well worth the visit."
8,4.0,"The smallest of the temples in central Seoul, simple, leafy, peaceful, beautiful. Good english-language tour."
9,5.0,"Seoul is a major bustling city that still has gems of history tucked away.  The shrine houses wooden tablets from each of the Chosun kings.  The architecture is simple, with reds and greens, and the walk thru the complex is beautiful.  Take a guided tour (they have ones in English four times a day)."
