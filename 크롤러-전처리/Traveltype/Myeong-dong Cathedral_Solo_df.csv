0,5.0,Majestically located in the heart of Myeongdong. The ambiance is unbelievably serene. The picturesque landscape outside the cathedral made me took lots of selfies‚úåüèª. This is one of the best place to see when you are in Myeongdong area.
1,5.0,This is the birthplace of the Catholic community in Korea and the National Cathedral of the Archdiocese of Seoul. Built in the late 1800's in a Gothic style but of bricks not stone. There is a small grotto off to the side before going up to the church itself and a great place to light a candle and pray for peace for the Korean Peninsula.
2,3.0,"To stroll through the Myeongdong Shopping Street, climb a short hill to find this cathedral is very special. An oasis of calm in the midst of the hustle and bustle of commerce."
3,5.0,I was surprised to find a Catholic Cathedral in the centre of Seoul . Towering . I really appreciated silence inside : you can stop and make a prayer in absolute silence that is really appreciable .
4,5.0,"English mass at 9am.  You csn still feel the coldess even if the doors are closed.  The have PWD access, gives away free calendar during Christmas season til supplies last."
5,4.0,"I went shopping around Myongdong and got lost. I came upon this beautiful church. Outside, it is so beautiful at night time. I went inside, and inside was nice too. Beautiful place to go see and pray, and get in touch with God."
6,5.0,A stone's throw from the pedestrianised area at Myeong-dong.  A good place to make a stop for a quiet moment of reflection.
7,5.0,I visited the Cathedral as it is known as one of the oldest Roman Catholic Church in Seoul. Magnificent architecture. A beautiful place to visit and chances for tourists to take great pictures.
8,4.0,"I visited this national cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seoul twice during a recent visit to the city. The first time occurred on a Sunday when the church was jam-packed with parishioners. Even with crowded standing-room only, people continued to enter for the service. I decided to take a closer look at the exterior and return later for a look at the interior.Dedicated in 1898, the fairly simple cathedral building stands about 76 feet high with a bell tower rising to 153 feet. The church is noted for being one of the earliest examples of Gothic Revival architecture in Korea. Its gray-and-red brick exterior retains the pure Gothic style. The structure looms on a hill above the Myeong-dong shopping district and seems to attract many tourists, based on the photos I saw being taken when I returned to explore the interior.The exterior belies the decorations within. These include arched sides aisles, stained-glass windows, religious artwork and statues. Only a handful of people were there on a weekday afternoon, looking around beneath the vaulted ceiling.A sanctuary for protestors during military rule, the cathedral has become a national symbol of democracy and human rights. I think the best photo ops occur at the entry stairway leading to the church."
9,5.0,This cathedral is really beautiful and well maintained.If you're staying in myeongdong area then it's just a 2 min walk to this cathedral.
10,5.0,This is one of the best church I like. It's on the most place in Seoul. It's peaceful although many crowded place are around.
11,5.0,"Myeongdong cathedral is so beautiful, it sits just off one of the main strips but that area its self seems so much more relaxed and quiet that the crazy shopping streets, as I went at Christmas, the area leading up to the cathedral was covered in white glowing flowers and at the top there was a large nativity display if you walk the grounds you'll find and area where you can light a votive candle which i though was very special being a Roman catholic. there is also a cafe on the grounds"
12,3.0,"This cathedral is quite striking and I enjoyed taking a stroll through it to admire the stained glass windows, large scale religious paintings, and sculptures inside. There was also a pretty and peaceful park out the back side of the cathedral where I got some nice pictures. It would be worth a quick visit to see if you are in the area and/or have any interest in historic buildings."
13,4.0,"I stopped by this cathedral while in the area on my way to Seoul Tower.  It makes for a 20-30 minute visit and it's always refreshing to get out of the noise of the city and into the peace of an impressive cathedral.  While not as physically imposing or impressive as many European cathedrals, it is rare to see such a beautiful and historic Gothic church in South Korea.  I enjoyed my quick stop and would recommend it if you are in the area."
14,5.0,A very nice cathedral. Service on Sundays in English. This place also played an important role in the process of democratization of South Korea.
15,4.0,"Came across this cathedral during my visit to Myeongdong shopping district. Cool building, check it out."
16,5.0,"The opportunity to attend Mass was an unexpected benefit during a long two-week business trip through Japan and Korea. The Cathedral was a short cab ride from my hotel - the Millennium Seoul Hilton. The 9:00 Mass is in English. The Church was absolutely filled, which enhanced the experienced of worshipping in a foreign country.  I had to use my Mass App to find the readings as I did not notice a Missal or Flyer with the readings pre-printed. Not a big deal for me. The Mass was reverent and the Cathedral grounds are lovely. As the 9:00 was ending, people were already lined up at the doors for the 10:00. After Mass, I wondered around the grounds, then into the adjoining streets to visit the food stalls that were opening for the day."
17,5.0,"There are week day masses in the morning and evening. Although, all are in Korean, it is a good way to start or end a hectic travel day."
18,5.0,I went there during winter with my korean boyfriend and it was really pretty and romantic ! I really enjoyed the ligts all around the catherdal and the atmospehre around it!
19,5.0,"How to get there?Line 4: Myeong-dong Station Exit 9, 10; Line 2: Euljiro 1(il) ga Station Exit 5, 6; Euljiro 3 (sam) ga"
20,4.0,"Myeong-dong Cathedral is the Church for Archdiocese of Seoul and was also the birthplace for the Roman Catholic Church community in Korea. It is located at one end of Myeongdong Street in Seoul. It looks quite impressive. Bishop Laurent Joseph Imbert, and priests Peter Simon and James; Pourthie Jean Antoine are buried here.Admission is free and services are held regularly."
21,5.0,"Within the myeongdong shopping district. They have 9am English mass. Going inside the church, you need to queue outside - very organize! The s church decor is stunning and adorable. The facade of the church is a good for photo ops."
22,4.0,This is just off Myeongdong shopping street. Since that's a must visit place I guess this is too.Building in great condition.  Nice architecture. Beautiful stained glass inside and pictures ARE available allowed.  Worth checking out definitely
23,4.0,Located in a quite central location for Seoul visitors. Nice cathedral to visit regardless of being a believer or not. Worth visiting for sure.
24,5.0,"So fortunate and blessed to have visited the cathedral. After a long day walking the streets of Seoul, you can find peace, calmness just by sitting inside. A beautiful place for the soul."
25,5.0,Inside and out equally stunning. The quite places to pray ouside were very moving. Did find difficulties finding. No real direct access.
26,4.0,A lot bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside. If you're into this kind of thing it is a pretty cathedral. I visited during Sunday mass and it was almost full.
27,5.0,"I happened to arrive just in time for Saturday night mass. I would definitely recommend checking the website so that you can see a service taking place.  Of course I couldn't understand the words, but I was still moved by the music and the fellowship of the people-the church was very crowded! The architecture is simple and beautiful-the stained glass windows very pretty.   It is a lovely place to rest and get a break from the teeming crowds of the market.  Outside, there is a gift/book store with a nice selection of religious items and books.  This is well worth the visit when you are in the area."
28,4.0,"Lovely cathedral. Beside all the shops in the Myeongdong district. You really can't miss it. A lovely shrine outside, to the left hand side, where you can light a candle for 1,000won. There is also s shop selling lots of different Catholic items, from rosary beads to books. The cathedral itself is quite big with beautiful stained glass windows. It's s lovely, peaceful place in a rather busy district. The 9am Sunday service is in English."
29,4.0,"Up the stairs for about 2 to 3 minutes from the street to the entrance, this ""big all-brick"" cathedral is worth stopping by inside which you'll see beautiful patterns on the stained-glass windows (saw a painting too on a window glass), colorful figures of Jesus's disciples in a semicircle around the altar on the far end and a portrait of Pope John Paul II carved on stone (I believe he visited here); also with all the big-screen TVs mounted along the aisles, this you might call is a ""modernized"" cathedral.  Be sure to go around to the back of the cathedral too where there's a white statue of Virgin Mary and where you can light up some candles (there's a little place for that like a glass cabinet).And nearby, there's a ""pretty lively"" outdoor market area (or a Shopping Street but not a ""covered one"" with a long roof like those of Japan) with ""quite a few"" mobile kiosks for delicious-looking food items among various other things, and that market area stretches pretty close to an exit of Myeong-dong Metro Station (with more shops underground as is usually the case with pretty much all metro stations of Seoul - ""nice & vibrant"" sprawling underground spaces).Coming by subway, Myeong-dong Station (on Line 4) is where to get off followed by about a 10-minute walk north (with a few turns) to get to the bottom of the stairs leading to the Cathedral above.  You might miss the nearby market area (as mentioned above) depending on the route you take, but if you missed it on your way to the Cathedral, be sure to ""turn left"" on your way out after going back down the stairs and that will be a pretty straight way to the market.  Also, this same station is where you get off for N Seoul Tower although it's in the opposite direction as going to the Cathedral (to the south for the cable car taking you up Namsan Mountain to the Tower whereas it's to the north for the Cathedral)."
30,4.0,"I have been to this church many times since I was a kid. My mom would take me here for masses and let me buy cute Easter eggs. Since this place is so nostalgic, I still visit alone when I'm visiting Seoul and take pictures for my mom. I haven't been to the masses recently but this church is one of the oldest churches around and they just renovated it since the Pope was visiting. They also have souvenir shops so I often buy rosaries and bibles for my family. Whether or not you are religious, I would visit at least once. :)"
31,5.0,"How ironic that city or country's best Catholic church is right in the middle of the city, Seoul and right in the middle of the main shopping centers in the heart of Seoul.  If you like visition churches or missions as I do, I'm sure you would visit this church of course besides the shopping area right in MyoungDong district. It's a haven for lots of events, spiritual & tragic as this country experienced throughout this century and in history."
32,4.0,Pretty inside- something that you should check out if you're in the area but not really worth a special trip.
33,4.0,"- visited November 2016- around 40 minutes would be enough to visit the Cathedral- located right next to the shopping street of Myeongdong, so you can do shopping right after you visit the Cathedral- lots of good restaurants around too"
34,5.0,"Easily accessible from busy Myeongdong, the Cathedral sits majestically on a hill and is a welcome oasis from the local shopping bustle.The grounds are beautifully maintained and there was a lovely Nativity scene outside when I visited.  As my visit to Seoul was very brief I didn't have time to attend an English Sunday Mass but I believe they are held at 9am. The Cathedral isn't large when compared to other European Cathedrals but the lovely interior, with stained glass windows and vaulted ceilings, more than compensates and adds a sense of tranquility and space and light.When I visited it was quite busy but everybody was respectful and quiet and, for my short visit, it was a peaceful oasis for praying and gathering my thoughts before heading back to busy Myeongdong."
35,5.0,"The Myeongdong Cathedral has a very nice facade and nice location. The church is very quiet and the mass is solemn. The door is always closed to keep the silence inside. For foreigners, it has English  mass every Sunday at 9am. It's very near the Myeongdong Shopping area."
36,4.0,"I found striking the number of young worshipers on Friday at the  evening mass. The cathedral, if small compared to what I am used to see, looked vibrant. The multicolored candle glass containers by the shrines looked very Christmassy. It is on a hilly location."
37,4.0,This is a really peaceful and quite place in the heart of Myedong. It is a great place to find some peace with the main shopping and tourist area.
38,5.0,"Myeong-dong cathedral is the first parish church in korea & the first Catholic community was formed in 1784. Located in the heart of downtown seoul. You can take the line 4 and take off at myeongdong station, exit 6."
39,4.0,"My first visit to Korea and I had not appreciated the popularity of Christianity. In every town and village can be seen a spire or tower topped with a cross. Here in Seoul the Cathedral is a simple gothic structure. The building itself is relatively small in size.I was fortunate to visit on Sunday morning when mass was being held and the place was packed. All very traditional, prayers and hymns accompanied by an impressive sounding pipe organ and choir located high above the west doorTo imagine that the site is only the Cathedral is a deception - there are many associated buildings including a large complex of restaurants and shops in what appears to be an ""under croft""Visitor amenities and information are excellent"
40,5.0,"You don't expect to see such a nice, gothic-style cathedral in Myeongdong. It's kinda hidden for such a populated area."
41,4.0,"i've been here last dec. it has a nice exterior and interior, and comes with an elevator which i think can be used by those in a wheelchair.unfortunately i wasn't able to hear a mass when i was hear, so better check the website for details."
42,4.0,"The church caught my eye and thus I visited. YES if you have been to Europe then you have seen this kind of architecture before, but somehow the setting is still different. The feeling and the garden surrounding it doesn't seem like that from Europe and somehow has a distinctive Korean touch to it. To me it was an interesting visit as I didn't expect to see it and it was a place to watch the locals go about their daily lives. I highly recommend it to those who want to step out of Myeongdong shopping madness and enjoy a diverse side of Korea."
43,4.0,It is worthwhile to see Meyeong-dong Catholic Cathedral as it is apparently one the nicest catholic building in Korea. The flat screen TVs inside are just incredible for us European people.
44,5.0,"This cathedral is beautiful, very famous to travelers, and the center and heart of all catholic people in Korea. If you are catholic, don't miss the English mass on Sunday 9 am, and also never miss the basement where tomb of 3 martyrs and saints of early Korean catholic church is. Also good for a little walk around the cathedral and cultural complex named 1898 plaza. There were volunteers who gave out explanations to visitors in English, Chinese, and Japanese in weekends, but I'm not sure if they are still there."
45,5.0,I love this Cathedral. I remember seeing it at Korean Drama. Seeing it personally made me happy! It's a must visit place in Myeongdong area in Seoul.
46,4.0,"The cathedral is a must see in Seoul. It is majestic, gothic, and the root of Catholicism in Seoul. It gives testament to the fight for religious freedom. The grounds are beautiful and serene with grottos, candles, and spacious areas to walk. With that being said the mass itself was chaotic. The masses were every hour on the hour. That means people were coming and going for about 15 minutes at the beginning and 15 minutes at the end. It felt very businesslike and almost like an assembly line. But it's easy to find, has a mass in English (9 AM) and is beautiful."
47,4.0,"After shopping at myeongdong , can take time to visit this cathedral church with near myeongdong shopping street."
48,5.0,"I got lost while walking around Myeongdong and somehow found myself at the Myeongdong Cathedral. I take that as a blessing in disguise as I make it a point to visit churches whenever I travel. The Myeongdong Cathedral is a big and quiet cathedral located at the far end of the shopping district. It's right across the Cath Kidston shop, in case you plan to visit and attend mass."
49,5.0,"Located at the end of the Meyongdong shopping area, I atttended Palm Sunday last March, where several ladies were there to give you some "" leaves"" to bring in and be blessed. They hold English Mass every Sunday at 9 a.m. and have  english  readings and hymns book. I  saw the ladies are still wearing their shawl or scarf on their heads...very solemn  and respectful traditional...   The ladies of the Chorus  were  singing beautifully! Lovely, adorable Mass!"
50,5.0,"Attended the English mass on 2 Sundays when I was in Seoul. Though not as impressive as the ones you find in Europe, this is one noteworthy cathedral to visit in Asia."
51,1.0,"For me it is an utter waste of both time and my eyes. Growing up in Europe tou can see beautiful architecture  evereywhere. This is not the case for this chuch. I would rather look at the street food stands. Sure it is quite big but everything about it just oozes ""Meh"". Unless you are believer and happen to be in the neighborhood with time to spare, there's nothing for you here."
52,3.0,They could have done more out of the historic side of the church so people can understand it's influence for the Korean catholic believers. It's a bit random and if you are European or have visited some major cathedral is this place going to be disappointing
53,3.0,"If you love history, you have to go there. If not, you can pass. It is important in history but not the best place in Seoul."
54,5.0,Visited this place during the night time and stay there for an hour to enjoy the view. Very Christmas feel and you can snap some great shot here.
55,4.0,"Sitting on a slight hill above the bustling streets of Myeong-dong in central Seoul, shoppers paradise, sits the local Catholic Cathedral.I wandered up the Hill and inside to look around.The Christmas Nativity Scene was outside in the forecourt, very popular with locals and children.I did not walk around as a young couple were tying the knot.The architecture is modern and compared to European cathedrals, very restrained.Still, there was a peace inside away from the teeming city noise,Worth a look to reflect the Catholic Christian population in Korean about a third of the total people."
56,3.0,"The Myeongdong Cathedral is an active Roman Catholic church and seat of the Archbisop of Seoul. The cathedral as between 1892-1898 and is dedicated to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception. Interestingly, Myeongdong Cathedral is the first church built of bricks in Korea. It is a rare example of Gothic style architecture in Asia. Here you'll find expected narrow nave with high vaulted ceiling and window seals. The interior features attractive stained glass windows, paintings on both sides of the nave near the front of the church as well as images of the disciplines behind the altar.  The exterior of the building is a subtle design of various brick material, providing a simple and humble appearance, different to more ornate cathedrals you may have visited in Europe. There are religious sculpture figures in front of the church that you might want to see as well. In the end, Myeongdong Cathedral is a good attraction to see in Seoul. It is out of place in the busy, lively Myeongdong district but makes for a good break from the lights, shops and dining of this area neighbourhood. Note: Myeongdong Cathedral is open daily for visitations, you can also find the mass schedule available online."
57,4.0,Nice place to visit. Clam. You can get inside without entrance fee.Please keep quiet because it has Christians come here to pray.
58,4.0,The outside of the cathedral does not adequately prepare you for the inside.  If you are in Myeongdong then you should stop in for a visit.
59,2.0,This church is situated in Myeongdong with plenty of steps leading up to the church. It contrasts with most churches you would see in Korea.
60,4.0,Pleasant location and a nice cathedral.  Not as flash as some of the European ones but still a nice visit.  The grotto has a Virgin Mary and the ability to light a candle also.
61,4.0,"For full disclosure, I didn't actually enter the building but remained outside. The cathedral itself is very nice, of course not to the scale of Notre Dame de Paris or similar European Cathedrals. What's great about the Cathedral is where it is located. In front of it, a rencently built splanade, with a nice walk up to the cathedral, lightning and vegetation, allows for a better view of the Cathedral. And once you've reached the Cathedral, turn back and look up North to see a sea of modern buildings that contrast with the Cathedral. And look West to see the neon lights of the Myeongdong Shopping district."
62,4.0,"I was there on a Sunday and it was packed to the limit, but I still got a good look inside and was there for 20 min, not so easy to find it's and the end of the Myeong-dong shopping street, but a very beautiful cathedral."
63,5.0,The cathedral itself located opposite on Myeongdong 11 gil (You can take right turn from Myeongdong 10 gil also if you come from station).The church itself in Gothic style; Tall high rooftop and ceiling; coloful stainglass windows; quiet echo hall with bible book provided for christian believer to visit.
64,5.0,"It's a beautiful Gothic Catholic  cathedral in the city center located in an elevated portion, hence, there are several flights of stairs going up.Beautiful large flower pots line up the center of the stairs. It's also beautifully illuminated at night.Going down towards the left is already the Myeongdong shopping street."
65,5.0,The church looks awesome from the outside and even better from in inside. 9am Sunday mass in English is great.
66,4.0,If you want a break from the Myeongdong shopping madness this is the place to go. It's a bit touristy but if you go inside everyone is quiet and respectful. Very easily reached from Myeongdong and it's a great site to see. It's small but has an interesting history and I thought the architecture was very pleasing. Definitely worth it just for the moment of peace and quiet.
67,5.0,It' a beautiful church in the middle of the ultra modern Myeongdong area of Seoul. You can go inside and sit and soak in the tradition even if mass is not going on. Be quiet and respectful as it is a house of worship. Not too many people inside so it's a nice respite and quiet spot to think and pray if you wish.
68,4.0,"When you come myeongdong, don't miss the night view at the Cathedral. Just go take a look you will see the beautiful sight. Since at myeongdong, why not take a look. Downside: Outside the Cathedral is under construction."
69,3.0,Note that the stairway leading from the busy shopping streets to the quiet cathedral is currently under reconstruction. The building is not exceptional in itself but has an interesting (though relatively short) history.
