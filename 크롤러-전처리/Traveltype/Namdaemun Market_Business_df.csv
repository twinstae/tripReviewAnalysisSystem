16,2.0,Had a half a day to shop for gifts for the kids.  Went to Namdaemun and was disappointed. Wanted to find more traditional Korean gifts for the kids but most of the market is modern lower end junk similar to a flea market back in the States.  Nothing there that would be unique to Korea or would be a meaningful lasting gift.
17,3.0,This is a fairly hidden market of the city.  A big surprise for us that how large it actually is. A good place to go around for a half day.

25,3.0,"It is a large market, but the prices are not that cheap. The stores carry the same stuff. It is interesting to walk around for 1-2 hours.  There are food stalls but didn't try.  Insadong area has better selection of korean souvenirs if that is what you are looking for."
26,4.0,"While attending a conference it was a treat to go to the market almost every day and walk the streets, narrow passages, buildings and shops in the Namdaemun Market. What a place to get a closer glimpse of the Korean culture and their business acumen. Try the food and don't forget to bargain, especially when you buy more than one of an item. Great, great fun!!!"
27,3.0,I had a nice walk around the market - it took about an hour to an hour and half to cruise it all - mostly cheap low quality cloth and hats. I quess the market is ok if you want to see and smell what an asian market is like.

29,5.0,"Loved having my dinners in the night market and watching the entertaining antics of locals on SoJu.... food was open air and didn't seemed to be refrigerated (meat and seafoods).. but it was all in extremely clean and well kept food stands. Loved this place at night, had a great social atmosphere. Locals were super gracious and friendly. Although some seemed to look straight through you! part of the fun, plenty of great stuff to buy amongst the junkier stuff."

32,4.0,We went here as it was recommended to us by a colleague who lived in Seoul for a couple of years. We strolled down many of the narrow alley ways where there were little kitchens where the locals ate at. We did not buy anything but found the market worth a visit as it was full of atmosphere and different to other shopping strips.
33,3.0,"This indoor and outdoor market area was near my hotel so I strolled through it a number of times.  it's fun to see how the locals gather around food markets for a meal or to aggressively bargain for a deal.  But found one needs to be a skilled shopper with a good eye to find things of value amongst a great deal of cheap clothing and trinkets.  If you have the time and fortitude there are probably some great finds.There are shops behind the multiple kiosks that line the streets that have some very nice household goods. There isn't a lot of English spoken here so you need to be prepared for some serious searching. I ventured into a bedding shop with a Korean speaking colleague and saw some lovely and good quality blankets - but they were not cheap.  I think the pricing is very flexible and is based on what the seller thinks they can get after sizing you up. Packaged teas, nuts and other food items looked good too.    If you are feeling brave, you can get some very cheap street food - mostly deep fried dough with various meat and vegetable filling.  I had some very good fried vegetable dumplings and was fine.  I understand the market really kicks into high gear later in the evening but I never experienced this."
34,3.0,"One of the oldest markets in Seoul, dating back 600 years ago. Pretty sure it almost looks the same except for keychains, K pop memorabilia and Frozen dresses. Worth a walk through"
35,3.0,"Just like any other market, but i noticed their cleanliness for the street food. Try to walking around and found some interesting store. I stopped once to the souvenir shop and i was very surprised because the seller able to speak Bahasa, such ""Tunggu sebentar"" and ""Terima kasih""."
36,4.0,Loved the donuts and so did my kids!  Bought a great belt for $7.00.  A few different street food stalls worth a try!
37,4.0,"Easy to get to on the Metro, this market offers a vast array of cheap souvenirs and also more upmarket items - fur coat anyone? Get ready to bargain.Even if you don't buy anything make sure you sit at one of the food stalls and get something Korean to eat. It's great tasting and cheap. Most of the vendors will manage a little English.You mustn't be shy - just go for it!"
38,3.0,"Good deals and rip-offs alike are abound. It is organized into sections for shoes, adults, children, toys, etc. Some of the merchandise is low quality so be careful. It is interesting to just walk and do people watching."
39,5.0,"If you like outdoor markets you have to spend some time in Namdaemun market.  Be adventurous and try the alley ways where you will find small kitchens and good eats for cheap.  The vendors are not as open to bargaining as they were years ago, but don't be afraid to ask for a discount.  Or better yet, just go there for the experience and something to eat."
40,5.0,"This market offers mostly women's clothing at excellent prices if one is willing to bargain. This is a market for locals so you get a feeling for the real Korea. Very little English is spoken by the merchants, but they use calculators to bargain their prices.  We really enjoyed our day in this busy, huge market area.."
41,4.0,"Whether you are looking for chopsticks or new eye glasses, you can find it here.  Check prices, as like most markets you'll find the same items in many shops."
42,4.0,"At a loose end on a business trip to Seoul, while staying at Grand Hilton, I hopped on the free shuttle bus and was dropped right outside the market. Not sure which way to head so just walked in, and wandered around. Lots of clothes shops selling American college T-shirts etc, and a few selling more traditional local clothing, lots of leather goods, sunglasses, watches, beauty products...the list goes on. A lack of children's clothes though - was looking for a 'Gangnam Style' t-shirt for my 8 yr old but no luck. Lots of things for young daughters though - hairbands, bracelets etc. Some good food stalls - tried a sugar cane drink that was lovely , but then tried something deep fried on a stick that was pretty tasteless. Fruit on a stick also went down well. Gave the seafood sellers a miss though!Nice not to get hassled by the market owners - just wandered around browsing. All in all, a couple of hours well spent."
43,3.0,"It's a nice area to walk around and see different things.  In terms of products, I was not very impressed as it mostly appeared to be knock-off items, but maybe I was in the wrong area.  If you are looking for inexpensive clothing and potential knock-offs, then this area is for you."
44,3.0,"The market is interesting and worth a visit.  However, I did not find the prices to be very low.  I bought several silk scarves, but I would have paid about the same in the US.  I found many of the products to be low quality with a mid range price."
