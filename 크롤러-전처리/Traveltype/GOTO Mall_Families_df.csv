Not like those in Dongdaemun where the price are usually quoted quite high and you need to bargain with the seller.It's an underground shopping mall, it's good to shop there when weather is cold, hot or raining."

Although this is not the biggest underground mall, but i feel that it have the largest variety. They have retailers selling not only clothes and accessories, but household items, paintings, decorative items, etc. Just bring a luggage with you when you go there so that you don't have to carry all the items you buy as they don't give you big bags even if you buy many things."

The quality of clothes were not as good as the ""made in Korea"" ones and appeared to have been imported fromChina . That said, being the shopaholic that I am I did pick up a few items that were really cheap . Prices starts from 5000W onwards"

And this place is underground, so not affected by weather at all. Best shopping experience in Seoul was found here."
