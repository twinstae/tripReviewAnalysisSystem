1,4.0,It's connected to Yongsan train station. Big mall and good for a visit. They have an event hall that brings some items to discount. It's good and cheap.
2,3.0,"We read blogs about ""must visit"" this mall. So we came. Certainly not as what we had expected.Its quite far away from the main city. Mall is linked directly to the huge Yongsan train station.There is a huge upmarket departmental store called 12th Malling. Also a food court, supermarket & other mid end stores. Generally, the ambience is nice. Clean & posh. But really nothing extra-ordinary to justify making a long special trip all the way here.One can see many much better & similar upmarket stores, supermarkets & mid end shops in Seoul city centre itself eg Lotte World/Mart, Shinsegae & the various shopping streets like Myeongdong, Hongdae.Unless you happened to be on the way somewhere & this mall is along the ""way,"" & you have time to spare, drop by. Otherwise, better utilise your precious holiday time elsewhere."
3,3.0,"The mall comprise of multiple complexes, however not all connected to each other. Only the electronics and the toy floors are interesting. The mall is filled with European/Western brands, and often more expensive than in Europe. Additionally, the 3rd floor of the duty free mall sells good, which you have to pick up at the airport. This I figured out after paying and standing there really confused why they refused to give me my products. I thought this really was a hassle, as it would've been inconvenient to repack my luggage after picking up my products at the airport. Luckily, they weren't too difficult about canceling my order."
4,4.0,Good mall... little far from central... connected to train station... big mall... mostly good for locals and house products... good place for kids... not recommended for electronics because it is expensive.... behind the mall there is big electronics market... overall worth a visit.
