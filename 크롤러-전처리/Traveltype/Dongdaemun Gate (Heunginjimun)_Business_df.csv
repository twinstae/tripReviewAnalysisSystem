1,5.0,Witnessing the history of Seoul in the middle of the bustling square is priceless.The gate's design is brilliant and the marks of history and war are overwhelming.The challenge is to take a photo with no traffic.
2,4.0,We chanced upon the Dongdaemun Gate on the way to the night markets and Design Museum. It's beautifully lighted at night. It was drizzling and a bit cold that's why we didn't have time to go up close and check the facade.It's a must see in the area especially at night.
3,4.0,"It is great to see this old gate lit up at night but at the same time, I definitely would prefer a old seoul rather than the new one. Surrounded by the modern buildings that grace Seoul's skyline, this is a nice break along with Dongdaemum history and culture park."

Make sure you bargain on the price, as first price can Usually be negotiated for 20-30% less.I do not like Korean street food, but if you do, there are plenty of shops for eating.If a shopkeeper is sleep, do not wake him/her up to ask for a price!!"
