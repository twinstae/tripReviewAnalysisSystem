0,4.0,"We were attracted by the lights at first, around midnight near our hotel in Seoul station. Taking those lighted stairs revealed at first a nice potted garden with each pot labeled with the latin botanical name for each plant. As we continued our walk, we found more than plants - it was a whimsical park, with working pianos, an embassy for an alien planet (where you can take official pictures behind the alien flag), trampolines, kids' drawing station, glass floors, and other rather amusing play areas - all free! Even late at night, the park felt safe - there are people walking through even after midnight. Also, the uniformed park keepers are still around late, with lighted red candlesticks in hand. This is an enjoyable place to walk, and it is most convenient when going from Seoul Station to Namdaemum or the Hoehyeon Station. Skip the traffic and take a walk in Seoullo - it will bring a smile to your heart!"
1,4.0,"This was an elevated walkway that was more than just glass, metal and concrete.  Everywhere planter boxes were filled with different types of trees, flowers and plants. All labeled in both Korean and Latin and some in bloom.  It made the walk more pleasant getting to Seoul Square especially not having to wait for crosswalk signals or traffic.A number of brightly colored pianos were randomly located and anyone could sit down and play a tune.  There also were some type of carts painted with animal characters that I  assumed could be used to wheel your kiddies around.The walkway was easily accessible through any number of stairs, elevators or ramps thus making it a convenient way of getting around the area."
2,4.0,Seollal was my wishlist back in 2017 but only managed visit it this year.It was just infront of our 2nd homestay and at the back of Namdaemun gate 5.It was nice walking along the seollal with plants along with it and since it was cold during our visit we decided to have early lunch at the seolla building (dont remember the name) The building serve mostly for eateries.That time there was a marine exhibition being held.

4,2.0,"It’s a knock off attempt at the high line, except there is no design philosophy whatsoever. No effort made to make the motifs work with each other. Just ugly cement pots with flowers on a bridge"
5,5.0,"We discovered this by accident one evening when we decided to walk from Namdaemun market to Seoul station. The flowers are great and when lit up at night with the soft breeze, it is a fantastic walk with views over parts of the city."
6,5.0,"A must do! A long walk bridge, so uniquely done. Lovely plantations all along, colourful flowers! Steps and elevators at short distances for you to get off at various locations along the way. Equally stunning at night. Good promenade!"
7,5.0,"You can sign up for a free guided walking tour 3 days in advance through the official Visit Seoul website, but i found that it's perfectly satisfactory just walking and relaxing. The view is also pretty nice, you can see the moving traffic and buildings in the distance from above. There are multiple beautifully painted pianos which you can play on. All the plants have name tags including the korean and the scientific name. They are in alphabetical order and provide QR codes to access information about them."
8,4.0,Go here for a relaxing walk in the city. Green and no cars. Some spots with nice view. We had a coffee break between shopping and sightseeing.
9,4.0,"A newly renovated old viaduct for vehicles turned into a pedestrian walkway. It was completed n opened in July 2017.The former vehicle viaduct was deemed unsafe n too expensive to repair for vehicle use. It was converted to a pedestrian walkway. It begins at Seoul station opposite the Lotte Mart n ends at Namdemun Market gate 6.It is illuminated in blue led lights from 7.15pm onwards. Quite a sight to enjoy. Very convenient to walk with escalators and elevators at various points. Cafes, tourist info center n patrolling security personnel are on hand to to provide you with assistance.A must place to visit n enjoy."
10,4.0,It's a very beautiful attraction place in Seoul because so many flowers and trees along the walk away. It was very relaxing to walk in this place. This place will be nice to shoot buildings and railways in Seoul
11,2.0,"If your country have a overhead bridge, then no point visiting this place. It is simply a decorated overhead bridge with top down city views"
12,4.0,"Seoullo 7017 used to be an elevated flyover near the Seoul Train Station before it was converted into a pedestrian sky garden in 2017. Visited in mid-January when the temperature plunged to a few degrees Celsius. We were there for a walk after our dinner. It was very relaxing to walk in the park. We were there during Winter, thus there were no plants or trees along the sky garden but it could be seen what supposed to be areas where trees and plants will grow during other seasons of the year.There was a Light Festival during Winter to compensate the lack of plants, I suppose. The Light Festival was beautiful showing pieces of lights art. The pedestrian bridge also offer a nice view of the surrounding bustling urban area.Would recommend if you like to enjoy urban parks and appreciate urban infrastructure/buildings, generally urbanisation."
13,4.0,"We're visiting Seoullo on our winter trip and we loved the view from the top. By walking through Seoul Station exit 2, we reached this new landmark. It was near the old building of Seoul Station. It was very windy and the temperature was about - 13 celcius, but still we enjoyed to be there.  If you like to walk along, there are three routes that you can choose. Along this bridge, there are some cafés and information center."
14,4.0,"This is a alleviated pedestrian bridge with broad walkway and benches. Beside linking the shopping Mall and the popular Lotte Outlets and Lotte Mart to Seoul Station, this bridge gives a good overview of the roads and surrounding buildings. My family chances upon this pedestrian bridge and was impressed with the place. At that time the sun was just setting and we could have a beautiful sight of the setting sun."
