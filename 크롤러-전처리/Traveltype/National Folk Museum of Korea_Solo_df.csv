There are many exhibits, and explanations in English.While the main museum is covered, there are many exhibits outside in the park.  As such  it is not a good idea to visit on a rainy day."
1,5.0,"I visited this museum and walked around visiting some exhibits.  This museum has permanent exhibitions on the lives of ancient Koreans. They are fabulous to look at and you can get a good sense of how they lived.  This museum is clean, neat, and bright. They have a lovely gift shop and you can even get some ice cream here.  Best part of all, the museum admission is free.  I highly recommend this place."
2,5.0,"The National Folk Museum sits at the back of Gyeongbokgung and you really can't miss the large pagoda. To be honest I had little desire to come here, but because I stayed nearby and its free, I thought I might as well. The pagoda is a landmark in Seoul and has featured on many a tourist literature. There are some old buildings that have been moved here, as have some Jangseung (totom poles) and there's a small street that illustrates what South Korea was like decades ago. The museum is quite nice and the exhibits are well presented. There's a children's museum which I didn't go to. Contents include general Korean culture and life in the Joseon Dynasty. There is some overlap with other museums and attractions in Seoul. Similar items can be seen at the National Palace Museum which is also on the Gyeongbokgung grounds and the National Museum of Korea. In terms old old hanoks, there is the Namsan Hanok Village.  So the National Folk Museum is like the greatest hits of korean museums in terms of culture. If you don't have the time to visit them all. Visit the National Folk Museum.  I'd definitely go again."
3,4.0,Free to enter once you have paid into Gyeongbokgung Palace and is remarkable to see from the outside with its stunning pagoda.I didn't stay too long inside as by the time I reached it the whole oslaceccomplex was due to close within an hour but I found it very enlightening and enjoyable. If it had been raining I would have spent longer and it would have been a great alternative to the palace.Well worth a visit though.
4,4.0,"I came across The National Folk Museum of Korea purely by accident while waiting for the MMCA to open. Just across the street free, I thought why not? It's an interesting introduction to how Korean daily life and worship have evolved over time. Well worth a visit."
5,4.0,"I came to this museum after visiting the nearby Gyeongbokgung Palace. It showcased the  historical artifacts that were used in the daily lives of Korean people in the past, ie domestic, agricultural lifestyles and cultural beliefs. It has 3 permanent exhibitions and 2 special exhibitions. There is also a souvenir shop, toilet facilities and seats for resting. Admission is free."
6,5.0,"I visited this museum as part of a City tour, spent 45 minutes there and could have easily spent all day in and around the museum. It is in a relatively modern building, laid out really well and I spent all of my time in the Korean historical section. Most of the displays are described in Korean and English. Interestingly, a significant number of Korean visitors were dressed in national costume, a regular practice, apparently."
7,5.0,Was brought here by the tour guide. Went through the historical lifestyle of Koreans. Interesting exhibits.
8,5.0,"very educational, it show case not only current but also during the older era. love this place...is also good place for children too."
9,5.0,"A very nice museum inside and outside with some amazing buildings. There is also a museum only for kids. And the best thing is that this area is free to enter, but do yourself a favor and pay the 3000 wons to visit the temples. You won't regret it."
10,5.0,Very beautiful interesting museum. Splendid view around. It is situated near Gyeonbokgung Palace. It is necessary to take tour guide there to listen to Korean history.
11,5.0,If you visit the Gyeongbukgung Palace be sure to pay a visit to this wonderful museum which is a short walk away.  You’ll be able to cover the museum in a couple of hours in a casual stroll.  Stop and focus on any particular exhibit that interests you.  Most visitors to the Palace also visit the museum so be prepared for the bus tour groups that make their way through the museum group after group.  There are wonderful exhibits outside the museum of old Korean homes and store shops.  If you have kids the Children’s Museum is literally next door to the folk museum.
12,3.0,"Located on the Gyeongbokgung palace grounds you can go back and forth between the two with your palace admission ticket. The exhibits were interesting, featuring this like the origin and types of kimchi, traditional houses with furnished rooms that you could, with shoes off, walk up and look into. Its a nice hour or so to spend indoors after walking around the palace"
13,4.0,"While returning from samcheongdong gil road, i explored this place and as the entrance was free (which is usually not for museums) i decided to go inside. I must say it was worth a visit. Very well maintained open air museum, exhibiting everyday life of Korean people from prehistoric times.  Featuring Korean lifestyle, culture, houses, traditional utensils, rice storage shelter, Kimchi pots, grinding mill, irrigation system, agricultural tool and much more.Photography was a real pleasure here."
14,4.0,It’s free admission to this museum but it is within the site of Gyeongbokgung Palace and you need to pay to visit the Palace.  This museum presents Korean life during the Josean period from 1392 to 1910.  The museum is well organized with displays in both Korean and English.  There is a cafe and a gift shop in the museum.It is best to combine the visit to this museum with a visit to the Gyeongbokgung Palace and the nearby National Palace Museum of Korea.
15,5.0,"This is a MUST for giving any visitors to Korea a grounding in Ancient Korean History . The displays of Joseong period costumes and artifacts Show how Korea must have attained a kind of Esthetic perfection pre 1915 .. I think that this country has been ravaged by conflict and war , so to see the beauty and nobility of how they lived (clothes , pottery , art , interiors) is a good basis for enjoying or understanding Korea before experiencing present day Futuristic Seoul . Just awesome .. the surrounding gardens of the reconstructed Palace are also peaceful and pure of spirit"
16,4.0,A good overview of the history as well as some very nice displays.Not overly crowded despite being free!
17,3.0,"On my opinion, it is a good museum because you will know a lot about Korean culture, how they used to live and traditions. For occidentals it is very interesting to see culture differences, their origin and beginings. It has all the services, a medium size cafeteria area and a gift shop. However the museum is very small."
18,5.0,"Located inside the palace, this museum chronicles the history of the Korean people and their individual lives - marriage,  education, burial, war etc.There are many life sized models and replicas, the highlight of which has to be the funer bier. The gift shop has an interesting variety of souvenirs (slightly expensive).Good spot to keep out of the cold. Only thing is many locals sitting inside to keep out of the cold too, but not visiting exhibitions, just using the internet/texting, which can crowd things a little.Statues of the zodiac in stone outside made for a cute photograph. Worth a visit in winter."
19,4.0,"Neat place to visit. Their exhibits are really well done and are pretty cool to look at. They have very few artifacts though. Most things are replicas so unfortunately you won't see too many original pieces. Nonetheless, worth checking out if you're nearby the palace. They did a really good job setting the place up."
20,3.0,"This free museum is on the edge of Gyeongbokgung Palace, but you don't need to visit the palace to see the museum. The most impressive aspect is the pagoda that sits on top of the building, but it's not open to the public. The exhibits are interesting enough, but hardly startling."
21,3.0,"This is attached to the palace grounds so you can combine the two.Couple of decent exhibitions. The JUNK exhibition was nice. Free entry. Clean.  Numerous toilets. But is busy, usually with children running around."
22,5.0,"If you are in the nearby palace, you just have to get here as well. It displays a nice view on living in Korea a long time ago."
23,4.0,Lots to see in this museum and it is a lovely contrast to the largely empty temple. There is a lot of information about the culture of Korea and its history but nothing to do with religion.Interesting but definitely filtered.
24,5.0,Provides a cultural backdrop from understanding the people here.  The first two galleries are permanent and go back many centuries to highlight life here.  Worth visiting if you are already at Gyeongbokgong Palace.
25,5.0,This museum takes you how the Koreans live their lives in the past to the present day. You will get to see artefacts from potteries to clothes and books.Admission is free.
26,4.0,I enjoyed looking around this little museum exploring the history of South Korea. It was well laid out and had plenty of exhibits to explain the early history of South Korea. It's free to get in and next door to the palace.
27,5.0,"This museum is small but enough to get a feel for Korean culture. The outdoor part is better than the inside part (in my opinion) and contains things such as spirit totem poles, tomb guardians and a faux traditional street scene.Inside the museum are a few galleries that have very well set out displays- not much English signage though. You see farming tools, clothing and travel through the harvest seasons. I have been to larger folk museums elsewhere but this one was enough not to get bored. I spent 2 hrs there exploring.Free entry too."
28,4.0,"If you want to load up on history about Korea and how they live in the ancient times, this is the best place for you to go. It is an indoor exhibit and entrance is already included if you visit Gyeongbokgung Palace. Make sure to spend some time inside and be mindful of other people visiting the place"
29,4.0,"Just walking distance from the Gyeongbokgung Palace, free entrance to the National Folk Museum where you can view Historical Korean artifacts at no additional cost! Just make sure to keep your ticket and present it so you can go back and enter Gyeongbokgung Palace if needed."
30,3.0,"I came here as part of the Gyeongbokgung Palace tour. I am not the ""museum-ish"" kind of person but it was helpful to see the different artifacts and read descriptions here and there. If you're more of the outdoor kind of person, I'd recommend going to the folk villages instead of a museum."
31,4.0,"The Admission: FREE AdmissionThe Museum: It showcase the historical living conditions of Koreans in the olden times. There are outdoor model house/shops. There is also indoor museum with more display & exhibit. The Location: Subway Line 3, Gyeongbokgung Station, Exit 5"
32,4.0,Visited the museum one Saturday .. a very interesting and educational place to visit..enjoyed looking at the display .. makes us of modern technology.. with seats  to take some rest
33,4.0,"I came in here after visiting the Korean National History museum and the 2 almost step on each others toes. But the national was far better organised, easier to follow round and more English. If you don't get to the National then this is OK.  What pushed up the stars for me was it was Chinese New Year and there was a cultural market in front and a dancing band."
34,4.0,This place  has nice exhbits with history.  You can find the entrance by and inside Gyeongbokgung palace.  The best thing is that it is free.  They have many interesting exhibits and it is worth a visit.  Lots of information.    there is also a part of the museum that is outside for more exhibits.  if you are at the palace you really should go in for a visit
35,5.0,So much culture and history. This place is  absolutely fascinating. So much to learn and experience. The area is beautiful and the interior is so modern and clean
36,4.0,A terrific way to learn the history of Korea in a few hours' visit to this museum right next to the palace. Well-conceived exhibits show off Korean tradition and culture.
37,4.0,This is in the vicinity of the Gyeongbokgung Palace. It's free and you can also check the open air exhibits to learn more about the old times.
38,5.0,"This museum will give you the taste of Korean lifestyle from time to time. Me myself is not a big fan of museum, most of the time whenever i visit museum, I will go thoroughly to its collection only in several first minutes and later just skimming the collections and take pictures. But this museum could kept my attention sometime longer. This museum is free, which is good. And, my favorite part is the area outside museum, there are some interesting area/building (picture attached). This is located next to gyeongbokgung palace, so you can plan your visit carefully if you want to visit both the palace and museum."
39,4.0,"As it is Titled, The National Folk Museum of Korea, this place will give you a Glimpse of the History behind the Korean Legacy. It can be visited with the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Its  Must visit Museum to know the History behind Korea."
40,3.0,"This is a pleasant place to spend about an hour or so. It has some nice exhibits about Korean people, how life in Korea has changed, and the country's history. We enjoyed our visit, especially the exhibit about clothing."
41,3.0,"I was more interested in the building itself, but you are restricted to just the bottom floor.  There are some decent exhibits, but I felt like there was not too much to see.  But since it is included with your Palace ticket, why not check it out."
42,5.0,Gave me a good perspective of Korean history as well as culture and traditions. It was air conditioned and no additional cost with a visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace.
43,3.0,If you are visiting the palace you can get in for free. Just outside the entrance is a free wifi zone with a lot of benches. The information in english was not the best. I liked the hall about the korean life cycle the most. Don't forget to check out the museum shop!
44,4.0,Very interesting museum and also a great location in Seoul .Many different rooms with different topics that show the growth of the Korean people.Highly recommended .
45,5.0,"A free museum (if you bought tickets to Gyeongbokgung) that will give you a lot of insight into the traditional history of Korea, from the way people lived to the way kimchi is made, it'll give you a deep appreciation for the country's history and culture."
46,5.0,"I walked in not expecting much, wandered about the outside exhibition and also went inside. In short this place is ideal for those, who want to learn about how Koreans used to live. It is one thing to look at pictures and read, another seeing facilities and artifacts from that time. It doesn't seem like much at first, but once you go into the inside museum and see with what care and love the exhibition is made you can't help yourself and stroll further into the museum. Recommend for people, who want to learn about the history of Korean living!"
47,5.0,Tourists to Seoul must include this place.  It tells a lot about the Korean people and their past.  It is educational and instructive.
48,4.0,"The National Folk Museum is located on the grounds of Gyeongbokgung Palace.  Admission is free which you can't beat!  It has great scenes or Korean life in the past.  It's definitely worth a visit even if I had to pay a small fee.  If you want, you can also walk further up to visit the Blue House where the President of South Korea lives."
49,5.0,Just around the corner from the Gyeonbokgung palace. Two sections - an open air section with sculptures in wood and stone of the spirit guardians that used to protect villages. Then an area of traditional shops. Then the main building that presents traditional Korean culture in a fascinating and often interactive way. Especially enjoyed the displays of traditional banquests and  a wedding ceremony. This museum is also very popular with visitors from China. Excellent bookshop as well for those who want more information on this fascinating culture.
50,5.0,"This museum is free and includes a lot of interesting exhibits to discuss folk culture in Korea. It is in between Changdeokgung Palace and Gyeongbukgung palace so it is convenient. The outdoor area is my favorite part. It shows shops from the 1960's, including a cafe and a barber shop."
51,5.0,"Very nice museum explaining how was life in ancient time, the development of the language and the living conditions. Nice reproduction of traditional houses"
52,5.0,"Being on the same grounds as Gyeonbokgung Palace, this museum can easily be bypassed.  It would be a mistake as this is an exceptional museum, very well laid out.There are 3 main galleries.  The first covers the Historical period of Korea, from prehistoric to the 20th century.  The second gallery covers seasonal life (i.e. how people lived and adapted to the 4 seasons).  The third gallery covers life passages (i.e. from birth, to marriage, to death).  It shows the various rituals and customs practiced during the Joeson period.I would highly recommend the audio guide (1,000 won + ID), which provides over 150 commentaries/exhibits.  While the English signage is good, the audio guide will provide much more and in depth information."
53,5.0,"THE NATIONAL FOLK MUSEUM OF KOREAThis is an almost unique museum, that highlights the Korean common folk, and particularly the agriculturists, who have formed  a large part of the total population over the centuries.  The emphasis is primarily on their history and their way of life, from the Paleolithic period to the present.    Many of the exhibits highlight life in a traditional Korean village , including an ox-drawn mill-stone and a water mill. These highlight the lifestyle and the customs of the people. There is considerable emphasis on agricultural implements and practices.  The visitor also sees centuries-old household goods as well as hats, shoes, traditional costumes, medical practices and even fortune-telling. Several displays are out in the open. These include a century old street scene and larger-than-life effigies of civil officials.  Of particular interest is a complete circa 1848  cottage including household items, donated by the Nam family. Many of these exquisite cultural gems represent a journey back in time.The main building of the museum has a traditional architectural design based on Korean Beopjusa Temple.  Temple architecture is also the inspiration for other areas of the museum building.There is a large children’s museum on the grounds, with a wide range of exhibits, including some for hands-on study.  Visitors are offered free private guided tours  of the museum in English, Korean,  Chinese and Japanese.  The very well stocked library and archives should satisfy even the most demanding scholar’s thirst for knowledge. The museum shop has a good selection of books, , picture postcards, DVDs, as well as replicas of historic artifacts. A large café helps the visitors to ‘recharge their batteries’ before continuing their visit of the museum. Every Saturday, there is a one-hour cultural programme of Korean music and dances in the well laid-out and air-cpnditioned auditorium of the museum. The performances are by the cream of Korean cultural talent, and the audience  shows the performers  the utmost reverence. The programme includes folk and classical dances from the Gyeongge and Yeongnam regions of Korea.  The music is performed on traditional Korean string, wind and percussion instruments. The cultural programme is a befitting introduction to one of Asia’s richest and most exquisitely beautiful cultures, and is one of the highlights of a visit to the National Folk Museum of Korea. Hormuz P. Mama"
54,5.0,Found the place almost by chance on my way out of Gyeongbokgung. This is a rather classical museum but very well done. Clever (meaning : limited)  use of electronics and mostly many beautiful and interesting artefacts. I initially thought that the Museum was completely disorganized and that the visit would vibe difficult then realized that the designers made a clever work in suggesting a natural path through the various sections. Well done. Highly informative. Warning the place is larger than you could expect. It takes time to go through if you have a minimum of interest.
55,4.0,"It is located behind gyeongbokgung palace. it is free of charge. It contains 4 exhibition hall that shows history, culture and tradition of korean people. It is arranged in interesting pax so it differs from typical museum that i had visited before. It has cafe and playground for children."
56,5.0,"As all Palaces are empty, this museum offers a good complement to imagine how people lived in different times and according to different social levels. The museum is free. You can access it when visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace. there is an outdoor space as well with a couple of historci houses, statues, a children's museum etc."
57,4.0,"I visited this Museum included in a tour with 2 Palaces. Very interesting watching some artífacts like old pottery, canoes, figurines and videos  representing the old traditional ""tea hour"" , their costumes, which were my favourites, and their old houses. There were lots of school children enjoying very much this Museum. Nice small souvenir shop for collectors."
58,5.0,This museum has lots of interesting eye catching exhibits about Korean life both past and present.  Most of the information is also in English and there is plenty of room to move around.  There are good toilets and the gift shop has an interesting and well priced selection - I bought a really good English cookbook here on kimchi making.
59,4.0,"As you walk in the museum doesn't look that exciting. But after walking through the first couple of rooms, you'll see a lot of interesting aspects of Korean culture: food, life in a Korean classroom 50-60 years ago, war outfits, life in a Korean home before the modern era, etc. You'll get an education and the museum is free."
60,4.0,This is an interesting museum and definitely well worth a look whilst you visit the Gyeongbokgung Palace as its next door and you can pop out and back in of the palace.
61,3.0,"I am quite interested in history, but haven't read much about Korean history unfortunately. That resulted in my visit being a bit of a bore. A lot of nice things to see, even some relatively modern things. Me being mostly into war history and such, especially WW2, there was not a weapon in sight. I should clearly visited the war museum instead. Toilets were plentiful and clean, there was a nice souvenir shop and a cafe - and even a lot of stuff for the kids."
62,5.0,interesting for children as well - inside and outdoor displays including life like village set up as in 1975; children's museum and playground adjacent.
63,4.0,This is a well put together museum and it has all the history you require to get an overview of Korea and its people.  I wasn't disappointed at the number of exhibits and its really good to see large numbers of Korean students and kids as well as tourists showing a real interest in the place. Go and look for yourself.
64,4.0,"If you are visiting Korea for the first time, this is a great location to start at. You will get a glimpse into the lives of ancient Koreans. You can wait for a guided tour, or you can get the audio headset to go at your own pace. When you get the headset, the person at the desk will ask for your ID. They will hang on to your ID until the headset is returned. When you leave the museum, you can either exit through the main gate, or through the palace. If you go through the palace, you must have a ticket to enter. You can buy a ticket booklet that will give you access to all 5 of the royal palaces that were around during the Joseon Dynasty and a nearby shrine. (10,000 Won)"
65,3.0,"Unfortunately my visiting to there was Tuesday, turned out it is closed in Tuesdays only. Please consider this when you visit. I cannot get back again for now but it looks really interesting. Cheers"
66,5.0,"This is a very nice museum that shows the history and culture of Korea.  They had 2 special displays, one highlighting a certain area of Korea.  Well worth a visit"
67,4.0,"I've been this place for several time, but I always look around thoroughly. There are a lot to see, so you may not have enough time to check out everything. Best place for those who wants to experience Korean Culture."
68,3.0,"Was it because I came here after the War Memorial?  This museum is still impressive but because War Memorial was the first museum I went to in Seoul, it set the standards, and it was really high.  I would say to visit this museum if you're in the area any way (like if you're there for Gyeongbokgung or Bukchon or Samgecheonro).  Also, if you've gone to the National Museum of Korea, then there is no need to come here.  This museum only has a fraction of what the National Museum has, however, it is more in depth because it is focused only on the ""folk"" history."
69,5.0,"The National Folk Museum is a must-see for anyone new to Korea or Asian culture in general. It is of average size but packed with fascinating displays that cover every aspect of traditional Korean life and culture you could possibly think of. There are three parts to the museum, covering the broad outline of Korean history, traditional village life in Korea according to the seasons and the traditional ceremonies that mark milestones in the lives of Koreans. This museum has numerous fantastic life-sized dioramas, including a wedding ceremony and schoolroom; along with other excellent interactive features, such as drawers where you can smell the various plants used in traditional medicine and headphones playing the sounds of the musical instruments on show. Everything from the Korean alphabet to making kimchi to 60th birthday parties is clearly explained in English and I found this museum gave me a solid foundation of Korean history and culture that allowed me to better appreciate other museums and historic buildings. I visited on one of the free English guided tours that are offered by volunteers on set days/times and can't recommend taking one enough. I was the only one on my tour and my guide answered every question I had even before I had thought to ask them. This museum will enhance your time in Korea immeasurably and should not be missed."
70,5.0,"If you are interested in Korean culture and life in the years before, this is the museum to go to. It is directly beside the largest palace in Seoul, worth a visit too. Not too far from the museum you can also try on traditional Korean clothing."
71,4.0,"My husband and I really enjoyed this museum because it gave some general history (not much of the exhibits are in English) and we were also able to join an English-speaking tour guide's group and learn a lot about the agricultural methods used by rice and tea farmers, which was pretty cool. Plan to spend 1-2 hours here, and check out the new exhibits. We learned a lot about Chinese new year when we were here, which was really applicable in February and totally awesome!"
72,5.0,The natural beauty surrounding the museum is absolutely stunningit's beautifully laid out not easily missed and you can't get lost it's got a nice in the description of Korean culture and history so if you ever stop by in Asia definitely check out this museum it's a were they treat for hungry passionate history loversI was very pleased ^^
73,5.0,This is adjacent to one of the major palaces.They offer a great overview of Korean history and culture with a large number of relevant artifacts and interpretations.It is very easy to enjoy with English only.Well worth an hour of your time.
74,3.0,"The museum is very well done, but does not provide as much information as I would have liked.  I was hoping to learn more about daily life and the evolution of the people and the country over time.  So I enjoyed it and it is worth your time if you are already in the area, but I would not make a special trip just to see this museum."
75,5.0,"This museum is located inside gyeongbukgung palace. Hence, one would have to walk right until the end of the main extrance of the palace in order to enter the museum. This museum had a display on a lot of korean's traditional antiques and crafts. Besides, there was also LCD display on korean history i.e. wordings, pronunciation, traditional wedding, etc. Certain displays were so real that it made me feel like as if I was going back in time. The museum is well maintained and organized."
76,5.0,"Detailed museum in a nice building.  The different galleries give you an insight into the highlights of Korean people lives, from birth to death.  You will learn a lot about how Korean people used to live until recently.  There is an outdoor area with a street typical of a traditional village that is also interesting.  And with free entry too there is no reason to miss it."
77,4.0,"Not to big, I walk through it in about an hour, some very nice things to see. And the development of Korea from long ago to now. And for me it was free because I was seeing the temple area next door."
78,5.0,"This is a must-visit museum in Seoul and I highly recommend you start your trip here so that you have more understanding about Korean culture and history to inform the rest of your trip. All signs are in both Korea and English, with extensive information provided and lots of interesting dioramas and artifacts to look at. This is a museum that the whole family can enjoy and get a lot out of. Fantastic museum."
79,5.0,"The reason I went there its because its next to Cheoukbung palace. It's was great, very decent stuff and good representation of the old life of Korea. I would love to go back!"
80,3.0,"The best part was learning about the old wedding traditions.  The childbirth exhibit was open (until the end of September 2014) but there was very little English in that exhibit.  Overall, it is a lot of history with a nice little gift shop.  The grounds are very nice and would be a good place to take a walk.  I got there taking bus 11 from City Hall metro stop."
81,5.0,I got to know more about history of Ancient and Modern Korea. Good place to look around for about 2-3 hours.
82,4.0,"I found the National Folk Museum of Korea to be an excellent site to visit during my short trip to Seoul this month. Entry into the museum was relatively inexpensive and once inside, there were LOADS of things to see and explore. I spent only about an hour in the museum; however, I would recommend allocating a bit more time (2 or more hours) to fully explore and enjoy."
83,5.0,I happened to arrive just in time for the 10:30 English tour. It was just myself and one other American tourist. Our guide was wonderful. She pointed out the most important displays and gave us her perspective. She answered any questions we had. She also asked us questions along the tour. She actually spent an additional half hour with us to make sure we did not miss anything. I don't think I would have gotten a true feel for Korean Life during different periods had I not done the tour. No cost for museum or guided tour.
84,5.0,"I love museums and I loved this one. The signage in English was great so I knew what I was looking at and there were displays on themes eg stages of life showing activities, costumes, utensils, furniture etc. Everything is spaciously laid out. Unfortunately I only had a short time there as I was on a day tour but I think I could have easily spent two or three hours there."
85,5.0,"I would have loved more time here, as someone interested in other cultures this was a treasure chest!Very accessible, good signage, well laid out, you can make it through here in about three hours. The time will be well spent!I did not have the opportunity to go through the village outside but I will do that next time.This is a don't miss!"
86,5.0,"A well laid out museum , not too detailed , but with enough information. I would have loved to see more merchandise in their souvenir shop, the Royal Palace museum's shop is much better. Great architecture outside."
87,4.0,"The museum was interesting, with displays being arranged based on seasons and important life events (birth, marriage, etc). I took the English tour and the guide was very knowledgeable and friendly. The tour is pretty long, so if you're going to the museum for a quick look around I wouldn't recommend it. It was very informative and interesting, though, so if you have the time and an interest in history, you should definitely plan to go one."
88,4.0,"This was a great experience. It is interesting for adults and has beautiful architecture, and the children's museum is great for kids. Bring lots of water if you are going in the summer, I got tired very quickly. Plan to purchase the 4 palace tour because this is right next to the Gyeongbokgun and changdeogun palaces, and you will save money by purchasing the combined pass (it is 8,000 won for changdeogun an secret garden alone, but 10,000 for changdeogun, the secret garden, Gyeongbokgun, and the Folk Museum (which includes the children's museum)."

After I finished touring the Gyeongbokgung Palace, there was an entrance to this museum. Several things deserve mentioning. First, the museum is well designed and the artifacts are enlightening. Two themes are used to organize the exhibits: life cycle--birth, marriage, and death, and seasonal change spring, summer, fall, and winter. This is an absolutely  brilliant idea to organize a museum that covers almost everything. Second, there seemed to be more Chinese tourists than Korean ones. They came as a group. Different guards passed behind me. Finally, I could even use a computer in a small resting area to send an e-mail message to my friend."

Adjecent is a fun park for kids, a new exhibit of a Korean town in the 50s, and so much more.  There is also a small museum shop, a coffee and snack shop to take a break and often life traditional music events are offered. Its fun for visitors of all ages"

You will need either the audio guide with this or a personal guide, otherwise you will miss the majority of the insight to how each of the many items are important.A nice addition to this museum is the Children's museum - though most parents are running their children through the main exhibits - this is a good place for them to let off some steam!!Of the exhibits, I was able to go through only exhibit 3 - but this covered every day life... births, weddings, doctors, acupuncture, transporation, sir names etc.  It was really interesting and the artifacts were brilliant.... But again, you are going to need TIME here if you are interested in really getting the most out of this museum."
92,4.0,"The National Folk Museum is not the nicest museum in Seoul, which has a lot of great museums, but I think it's the one that would take up the longest time since it's so full of information on the Korean way of life in Joseon times. I was here for almost two hours with an audio guide, and I was rushing through! I know everyone says it's at the Gyeongbokgung compound so you should see both as a matter of convenience, but please just note that it will take a while to go through it if you want to seriously consider each exhibit.Excellent place for Korea enthusiasts and people who want to kill time. There's a cute garden outside the museum with grandfather stone and old town replicas.You can enter the museum without paying for access to Gyeongbokgung. Just use the museum's own gate."
93,4.0,I went on a guided tour for this one. The surrounding area is beautiful. They have a wonderful sculpture structure of the chinese zodiac animals. the tour inside the museum was very interesting. They truly made learning about Koreas history interesting and amazing. The clothing and hair styles for that time are colorful and beautifully preserved. There was so much to see and  experience. I truly recommend this attraction.
