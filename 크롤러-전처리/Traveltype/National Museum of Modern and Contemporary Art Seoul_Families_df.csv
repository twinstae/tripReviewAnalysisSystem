0,3.0,"1 Adult went alone.  It cost Won 4,000 entry, but only 3 of 7 Galleries were open :(  The Duchamp exhibition had just closed :(  However, of those open, I enjoyed them - particulary Zach Blas idea of 'facial masks' to confuse CCTV cameras (good one!!) and Simon Denny to finally explain what Blockchain/Bit Coin technology really is!  I also enjoyed Cao Fei's idea of using an automatic cleaning machine within a restricted platform to demonstrate today's China: rapid economic development yet contain social conflict with generation gap contradictions.  Very good location for walking to historic village nearby (Bukchon Hanok Village) and a lovely Korean restaurant (the man outside wears a Panda outfit!), just beyond Pink Butter caf√©, opposite the national Library/Digital Archive Building.  (Another great peaceful place to study)"

We were an extended family group of 10 and it seems there was something for everyone. we didn't even have time to explore the food options, but thoroughly enjoyed the art and various exhibits. The museum has different areas, floors, exhibit spaces. Grownups and children roamed and found a variety of things that interested them. Will definitely go back next time in Seoul."
2,4.0,"f you like contemporary art this is a ""must see visit"" in Seoul.  Starting with the architecture of the building and the exhibitions rooms everything is great, particularly if you want to have a large vision of contemporary Korean art. The place is really big and consents the presence of very good installations. The museum is located in a nice area, in a cluster of many beautiful and interesting art galleries, cafes and restaurants."
3,4.0,"More than a museum this place looks like a big art gallery. If you like contemporary art, you will find beautiful and stunning works. 1.5 hours to see it all. Cafe for food on site. Open from 10-6pm (tickets will stop selling 1 hour before closing time - Wednesday closing time is after 6pm and admission is free every last Wednesday of the month). 500m walk from Anguk Station Line 3 exit 1. Closed mondays."
4,5.0,"We stumbled upon the Museum almost by chance, when walking from Insadong to the National Folk Museum during our first day in Seoul. It was a fine summer day and we decided to go in and discover it, while we waited for lunch time.If you are a lover of modern art and modern architecture, you will be pleasantly surprised. The building and surrounding areas are magnificent, and it's located right across the street from the National Folk Museum.Most exhibits are large-scale and they may be contemplated (or not, depending on your tastes) at your leisure and without disrupting the traffic flow - the MMCA is very well organized, the staff is pleasant and most exhibits have an index card in English. The restaurant (Caffe Grano) is also very recommended for an Italian lunch. The pizzas and pasta are good and not too expensive for a Museum cafe.We will return to the MMCA on our next visit to Seoul."
