3,4.0,"I visited the Bohemian-chic Garosu-Gil Street in my day tour. It is an upscale and trendy shopping and art district located south of the Han River in Sinsa-dong, Gangnam-gu. We had limited time for roaming around.  Garosu-gil, also known as ""Gingko Tree Lined Street"". The vibs are very youthful and hippy. SEE photos"
4,5.0,This tree lines street is filled with  boutiques which offer really nice clothes and accessories.   We also enjoyed cafes from the quaint 8 SECONDS cafe to the cutie ones like Line and Skin food cafe.  Not crowded at all.
5,5.0,short road but lots of shops and cafe in this area. clothes and accessories are pricey but some is unique and worth for money. those who love cafe hopping must love this neighborhood!
6,4.0,"A more unique and refined shopping experience in Seoul with its gingko tree lined avenue compared to the cosmetic street in Myeondong or the bargain basement sweep in Dongdaemun.Be warned that it may be expensive. Fun place to people watch, window shop or to have a cup of coffee"
7,4.0,One of the trendy & posh shopping district for the wealthy in seoul. And plenty of cafe & restaurant & bar around the area. But the most intersting sight i notice are many people walking with bandages after having plastic surgery.
8,5.0,beautiful street with shops along both sides and nice cafes to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee and some pastries. It was autumn and the trees along the road was just beautiful
9,4.0,"It's a good place for hangout. There are a lot of coffee shop, makeup store, and clothing store for youngsters."
10,5.0,"i really fell in love with this area. full of shopping and hang out places, but somehow it's still comfortable and not so run down with tourists. you can get a glimpse at the life of somewhat upper class seoulites. good looking bunch, i must say!"
11,5.0,"Went to this place cos of Line & Friends cafe, despite it being known for its many cafes. Friends had a good lunch there and we had fun walking / shopping around"
12,5.0,"Garosu-Gil is a real shopping street. Not only a local brands but also korea brands and designer's shops are located in this street. Not only fashion but also chic restaurants and cafes are situated in this street. You can enjoy shopping, eating, and chilling all day and all night."
13,5.0,anything and everything can be bought here. If you are looking for Korean cosmetics - you will find it here
14,5.0,"Went here twice during our stay in Seoul. The main street is great, but the really nice and chic cafes are in the little streets branching out from the main street, so a little bit of exploration is advised.We found really good places like C27, Acacia, Gilbert's Burgers and Fries, FIKA from these smaller streets and they're worth checking out."
15,5.0,"Love this place, I found this place kinda artistic. Gentle monster is aound this neighborhood, try to walk as deep as possible and you will discover a lot of good stuff. I made a video on my trip to seoul, come and watch my video for better details.search title :#5 TRAVEL BLOG DAY 4 SEOUL - BEAUTY STORE CAFE"
16,4.0,"The place is lined up with cafes and independent fashion brands, along with some branded shops like Gentle Monster. I would recommend this place to those who want a more chill day in Seoul. The district is not very crowded (since it's more high-end) so it is a good place to hang at when you want to take a breather from Myeongdong or Hongdae."
17,5.0,I was there with a few of my friends. We visiting the trendy shops - some famous brands such as Gentle Monster. This place is more like a museum than a shop selling glasses. You have other cute unique boutiques selling local brands. I adore the coffee shops there - big and great for people watching.
18,4.0,"What a charming district lined with trees and everyone dresses up so fashionably!Seems like a higher end district but good place to hang out, people watch or just relaxing in a cafe. Had limited time in garosu-gil but will definitely return again!"
19,3.0,We went here with the hope of seeing Korean celebrities. There are quite a number of upscale coffee places and stores around.
20,4.0,"I always visit Garosu-gil when in Seoul but it's more on the higher end of shopping and dining. The shops are a bit pricier and dining can add up too depending on where you go. They do have cute shops so you'll see a lot of tourists and young crowds hanging out in this area. If you are looking for something more cultural, then I wouldn't really waste too much time here."
21,4.0,Nice place to check out cafes and shop here. This place is perfect for fashionistas and Korean skin care product fans
22,5.0,Nice to street to buy different stuff at reasonable prices. Restaurants and bars can be found here as well
23,4.0,"A tree lined street rolling with boutiques and cafes, this place is perfect for an afternoon stroll. Cafes here are known for their food so visit one or two to have some cake and coffee and watch the world go by."
24,5.0,I love Garosu-gil area. Their shopping street is so beautiful. You can get everything here and there are a lot of mural as well. Instagram worth it place.
25,4.0,"On the one hand, Garosu-gil ""Green Street"" is basically a collection of over-priced restaurants and coffee shops.  On the other hand, if you want to see how the young, rich, and beautiful of Korea spend their afternoons this is the place to go.  Definitely worth visiting for at least 30 minutes before going elsewhere."
26,3.0,"Before few years, this was very specialized in unique style shops. However, this place is filled with many franchises and plastic surgery hospitals for Chinese or Japanese...... this is not worth becoming one of your trip plans when visiting Seoul...Just go Gyeng Buk Goong."
27,5.0,"As a coffee drinker, I was pleasantly surprised to find this neighborhood.  Depending on where you are staying in Seoul, Garosu-gil can either be quite convenient or a bit out of the way (as Seoul is such a big city).  Once you get there, however, there is so much to explore and so much coffee to drink!First, the coffee.  I never thought Seoul would have great coffee, but it was hands-down the best coffee I've had in Asia.  There are so many cafes that line this neighborhood that it was so hard to just choose a few to try.  I had a smooth and rich vanilla latte at one cafe and an impeccable cappuccino at another.  One of the best drinks I had, however, was a marron  (chestnut) latte and I don't think there was even coffee inside.  Second, Garosu-gil is also quite a hipster neighborhood, so there are also lots of boutique clothes and artisan shops to explore.  It was definitely worth spending a full day there."
28,4.0,There are lots of small shops to walk around and coffee shops to chill. There are also nice restaurants around the area with good atmosphere.
29,5.0,"During the Spring and some summer days, this is probably the closest you'll ever get to feeling like you are in California while traveling in Korea. Garosu-gil translates to ""street of trees"" or something like that. Boutique stores, coffee shops, and restaurants are situated on both sides of the street. I would even recommend going off the beaten path and exploring the side streets. There you will find other places which may tickle your fancy. During weekends expect large crowds.  If you stop in a coffee shop, don't be surprised if the person sitting beside you is famous. Garosu-gil is notorious to see and be seen."
30,3.0,There are shops but not as many as I expected but in return less crowded (on a Sunday afternoon). There a high-end shops but also average one.
31,5.0,"We went on a Sunday and enjoyed the variety of shops and prices (lower, comparing to Japan), so it was paradise for us on a girls trip. Plenty of cozy cafe shops to stop by, so you can relax as well - there are some nail salons too if interested. A must do if you are looking for shopping, and we had a very nice Korean lunch nearby."
32,5.0,"Love the beautiful gingko trees that line the street here. There are many cafes - good for catching up with friends. For shopaholics and cafe-hoppers, this area is a must. There are many photo taking opportunities of the shop fronts. Beautiful place. Will return again."
33,4.0,"There's a lot of shopping to do in this area. If you're not looking to do some shopping, then let all the unique cafes attract you. It's a busy area, but worth going to and looking around. Even if you're not fully sure where you're going, its busy enough that you'll find something you like, be it a cafe or a store."
34,5.0,"If you want a less hectic shopping experience than Myeongdong or Hongdae, def check this place out. There are also a lot of cute cafes you can relax in and just people watch. Buildings are really unique as well.There's also a cute jewelry shop that makes custom rings for you. Just pick out a design, get sized, go to a cafe to chill, and come back in an hour or so."
35,5.0,"Great place for shop and just enjoy your time with friends, do find C27 cheesecake shop, they have the best strawberry cheesecake."
36,5.0,"This street houses many unique interesting cafes and shops. Many local designers are also in this street exhibiting their designs in terms of jewelry, clothes etc. there's also a huge Line Friends shop, and many international brands."
37,4.0,Nice street with trees on both side. Many lovely shops and cafe.. Just strolling along and taking pictures is perfect. Some parts feels like in europe
38,5.0,The road is very lively. I love the coffee shops here and also the high quality stores. Would definitely come back again to enjoy the higher class street in Seoul.
39,5.0,shops can range from mid to high end depending on what you are looking for.. a nice area for shopping with local designers goods and curated shops which makes viewing easier..
40,3.0,"Garosu-gil is beautiful with gingko tree lined streets, upscale urban shopping and too many adorable cafes to count. Think, Soho in NYC.  Its got a European feel and I guess that what I didn't love about it - lacks Korean charm.  Feels like it could be any upscale shopping area in a large city.  Its almost like they are trying too hard NOT to be Korean.  But, the cafes are lovely with emphasis on COFFEE and DESSERTS (Korea is not a tea culture), everyone speaks English fairly well and you can find lots of ""western"" restaurants here - especially pasta and tacos.  A nice stop but I ended up taking subway all the way back to Ssamjil-gil in Insadong where I found WAY more unique things to buy."
41,5.0,"자주는 아니지만 산책+밥+디저트 하러 옴. 꼭 와야 될 정도는 아니지만 괜찮은 레스토랑 디저트샾이 꽤 있기에 추천.not so often, but come here with friends to hang out. good to take a walk and window shopping. Not a must visit spot, but recommendable cause there r good options for food and desserts."
42,4.0,"Garosu-gil has been duped as 'Europe in Seoul'. It is a trendy and hip place for you to shop, eat and just hanging around. This street frequently visited by the local fashionistas and young peoples that dressed well and look like supermodel, lol. I came here for cafe-hopping, which has various selection for independent and unique cafe that has nice interior. Good for photo-shooting too!"
43,4.0,"with trees lining on both sides of the street, this street is very scenic. This area mainly sells luxury goods, but there are several facial shops around here."
44,4.0,"When one visits Garosu-gil, everyone seems to flock towards the Line Friends Store & Cafe found along the ginko tree lined street.We arrived early to beat the crowd, if you are into the Line Messaging App, you will go ga-ga like the fans we found here. They take photos with every soft toy of the Line Friends characters displayed here. The cafe is another must try as they serve food and drinks in the image of the Line Friends. This place is cuteness infinity."
45,2.0,"I stayed in this area back in 2012 and loved its hipster charm and character then. Loved that the shops were unique and very local and that there were many small Korean restaurants. When I visited again this year though, there were more international brands and it looked and felt like any other high end street. It was also crowded and there were too many high end cars and too little parking areas. Very disappointing!"
46,4.0,"Gingko trees are lined up on Garusogil and its such a nice place too be during fall when leaves are changing folors. The place is not crowded, really an upscale place. Lots of shops including foreign brands are line up. Cafes and restaurants are also available in almost every corner."
47,5.0,This is my favorite shopping area in Seoul.  There are a lot of good coffee shops which serves great deserts.  The clothes skips are my favorite.
48,5.0,"It is more of the high end side, but it definitely worth checking out. A lot of mix brands here, and so many hipster cafes. Had the best brunch here."
49,4.0,"Interesting mix of European and Asian style, this place is filled with cafes, unique shops, and galleries. Line cafe is also located here."
50,5.0,"Beautiful area in Seoul which is so different... An area lined with gingko trees on both sides of the road, filled with lots of unique shops, cafes and restaurants.Definitely a wholesome new, special and enjoyable experience in Seoul!"
51,5.0,"Easily my favorite part of Seoul! Quaint streets lined with stores which isn't as crowded as Meyongdong.  It had a more relaxed vibe and I can spend hours in this place. Also discovered a new favorite store Neuf Hotel which is 4 stories of luxury and comfort, from clothes to furniture and home accessories.  Be sure to spend at least a day here to walk around, shop leisurely and get a nice cup of coffee from one of the many coffee shops in the area."
52,5.0,Easily reachable via subway exit 8. There are tons of small trendy shops on the side streets. Tons of eateries and trendy clothing stores. The best find is the Line Store and Cafe which opens noon. The streets are dotted with coffee shops. Particularly love Subling serving Korean dessert and with plenty seatings. Enjoy this neighorhood very much.
53,5.0,"If you want to people watch, this is the perfect place to find a chill cafe and just sit there for hours and watch the people go by. Very interesting place to visit if you like tree lined streets and cafe hopping."
54,5.0,"I was introduced by my Korean friend about this street. I went there at night (9pm-11pm) and most of the shop still doing business till late. The street is quite long and you can enjoy all the lovely shop & gorgeous people! I just love looking at their style. If you are a fashion lover, please come here!"
55,4.0,"First thing I noticed about this place was the boutique clothes that are different from the too-similar looking ones in Myeongdong, Dongdaemun and the usual retail chains. Some of the clothes are designed by the shop owners themselves, so they can be really unique, but it also goes to say that they can be on the pricey side.The cafes and restaurants here are divided into Japanese, Chinese, Western and Korean, and for tourists, we might not really want to visit the Japanese, Chinese, Western restaurants when we are already in Korea, so please go and find out where the Korean restaurants and cafes are. There are long stretches of Japanese and Western restaurants nearer to the metro station, hence it can be rather tempting to walk into one before you even step onto the street with Korean restaurants, but don’t do it! Aim for the Korean ones. Even if you choose to visit the Western ones, please be prepared to speak in Korean to the waitress and waiter. Get ready your Korean phrases for “no chili, no spicy” etc, for any special requests that you might have, to prevent regrets.The cafes here are really special, and it is quite cool to just sit in one café for the entire afternoon/night too. Awesome place for young people to come with your friends, and you could come alone too. The only thing I probably regret in this trip is that we allocated too little time for garosugil and did not visit as many cafes as we would have liked. So if you are coming, please plan for at least 4 hours more than what you originally intended."
56,5.0,"Before starting to make a travel around the world, I used to live around Garosu-gil. Now is the time you should go see and stroll along the road because there's a lot of fallen leaves with yellow-tinted street lamps and beautiful signboard waiting to be seen- get along the road till you get to Gosu-buji (Han-river Park) and enjoy the park along the river. I lived there for a long time, so my tip is you must see this street when snow has fallen. Couldn't be better! You'd better bring your state-of-the-art camera with you; if you don't have it, you should bring your smart phone. Take a picture and you can get a once-in-a-lifetime picture. Believe me; you will never regret. I myself had taken a lot of good pictures in this street."
57,4.0,"This long stretch of road has a lot of franchised coffee shops and small shops. You'll be able to see Korean style clothes. I would recommend wondering about the side roads off from the main road. There are more cafés and boutique shops. Bear in mind when you are planning your visit, that Garosugil is favoured by young couples so it gets extremely crowded during the weekends."
58,5.0,Love the restaurants and cafésGood shopping spot and hang outA place to see and be seen if you're a posh young adultI found a lot of great food in Garosu Gil area
59,5.0,"This is a great place to shop. There are many smaller boutiques & vintage shops along the street. Keep an eye for many outlets with great discounts on some of the korean designs and even designer items. There are many cafes, though more ""western"" cuisine than korean. However, there's a great fried chicken place called Hansu Chicken, which is after Forever 21, opposite King Kong Steakhouse. Only opens after 5 pm but if u can grab a couple of beers, and a plate of fried chicken, it's simply delish!!"
60,3.0,Walked along the main street during day time for some interesting Korean designer boutiques. Things here are generally more expensive but they are of higher quality. There are also some shops which caters to the more eccentric fashionista. Walk over to inner streets and you will discover some hidden gems too. Many cafes around too and Mango Six is recommended for a short tea time. A local told me this place is more interesting and happening at night on a weekend. I like this place as it's not overly crowded and much more of a joy to walk around.
61,4.0,shopping area with trendy cafes & shops. A joy to walk along when the weather is good. plenty of photo opportunities & star gazing (if you know your Korean stars).
62,5.0,"I visited a few times, but it's quite interesting. There are so many great restaurants in this area. High end food at mid price on competition. Even restaurants and coffee shops are featured and published in life style magazins like Monocles and Condes Nast. Use the mobile apps to look for venues. Restaurants my friends took were all in weird corners but fully occupied and booked most of time, just like all locals know while tourists like me can't think of going. All worth a visit. There seems more tourists than fancy local girls nowadays, but there are many fancy local designers selling niche stuff like alligator handbags at US$600-700 and cute fashionable t-shirts at US$20-30. Take 3 hours for food and shopping. Maybe a bit longer in case you'd like to sit in the cafe to check out gorgeous local people."
63,5.0,"Love it, shopping, cafes, and cherry koko is a very evil shop. I bought too many things but they were great value! Perfect Korean quality"
64,4.0,"This is a great area for an afternoon with the girls or for a quick shopping trip with your family. There are a lot of cafes and unique shops with nice and decently priced clothing. One difficult thing is that there is often only 1 or 2 of each piece and if you are not super thin as many Koreans are, you will have a hard time finding clothes so stick to shoes or grab a drink and people watch."
65,4.0,"Better known as ""Shinsa-dong"". It's known to be a boulevard lined with row of small boutique shops.  There are many hip cafes here.  Nice place to spend time here either shopping or just having a coffee, catching up with friends, or watching the crowd."
66,4.0,"Its a cozy hip place if you're into shopping, cafes and people watching.  Shopping is not cheap but you can stroll around and stop to grab a cup of latte in the array of quirky cafes."
67,3.0,"I came here to check out the rows of ginkgo trees in autumn. Sadly it was not yet peak foliage when I visited in late October. But I still enjoy walking along Garosu-gil, looking at the small shops, each with its unique deco. The rows of ginkgo trees are still lovely - only that the leaves are still green. I saw many young and trendy Koreans shop here. You can just sit in a cafe and watch people in trendy outfits - like a fashion show on the street. To get here, take line 3 to Sinsa Station (Exit 8). If you have time, yes you should come here to see a different Seoul (unlike hongdae, myeongdong, edae or even apgujeong)."
68,5.0,"This street is not only pretty, but the another neighborhood is filled with small specialty restaurants, coffee/cake shops, fashion boutiques with a wide variety of local merchandise at different price range. So anyone can find something you like and can afford here. This is one of the most trendy and hip district I've been too.  You will never get tired of this place.  We have tried several restaurants there and we loved them all.  We particularly liked a green bistro called April Market on the side street, we had the best flat bread and an angel hair pasta there!! If you only have 1 day in Seoul and you want to dine, shop till you drop. This is the place to be."
69,5.0,This is a good place to shop if you want to avoid the uncouth and loud tourist (from you-know-where) that plague Myeongdong and DFS. No peasants shouting from 1 end of the street to another and no rude interruptions when a salesperson attends to you.
