0,3.0,"This would not be a ""destination"" palace, but if you are in the area it is worth stopping by for a quick stroll. Admission is free of charge and an English brochure is available at the entrance to provide orientation and historical perspective."
1,5.0,"Unhyeonggung is located not far from Insadong and Changdeokgung Palace. It is in the middle of a street with no eye-catching sign, but you can find it through the traditional Korean gray rooftop. The mansion is free of charge with not many tourists. The buildings here are of strong traditional Korean style with white wall and brown wooden pillars. Strictly speaking, it is not a palace, but a residence of an emperor. So its Korean style is more authentic than those palaces."
2,5.0,"A small palace in Insadong, very peaceful and interesting. Free entry and lots of the information was in english"
3,4.0,"This palace is not included in the five royal palaces in Seoul. This is the home where the future king (Gojong) of Korea was born, grew up as a boy and was appointed king. This palace is more properly the residence of his father Heungseon Daewongun) who wielded real power. The palace is not coloured (unlike the royal palaces or venerated Buddhist temples). The structure is akin to a nobleman's house. Entry is free."
4,4.0,"I had been here once before in Winter. This was the second time I visited this place. Free admission on holiday. There were a lot of couples and families taking photos in area. Hanbok rental is the least expensive I can find in Seoul. For 3300 won, you can rent a hanbok to take pictures inside this royal private residence. Quality is ok but you get to try on hanbok for the price of a cup of coffee. This used to be a royal private residence although it has the ""gung"" in its name."
5,4.0,the palace was the home of crown prince in its day. Its not as spectacular as other palaces but it has a great feel to it and you could see it being an enjoyable place to live. The tiled walls next to the parade ground are spectacular. Entry is free which is a bonus and if you are of a mind you can dress up in period clothes for a truly Korean experience (for a small fee)
6,5.0,"My husband and I really enjoyed the little palace which was just up the road from where we were staying, it's free as most of them are and it was not too crowded either. A lot different to the other palaces we've seen, it's not heavily painted, it's all natural coloured wood with very nice detail to every panel. Tranquil feel & worth a look through."
7,4.0,"A few minutes walk from Anguk station is Unhyeonggun Palace, apparently what is here now is a smaller version of what was once the home of a past Joseon emperor. Damaged and rebuilt during recent Korean History from a much larger Palace, entry is free and there are no large crowds. The buildings remaining are well preserved and largely shown with mannequins and furniture reflecting their past purposes. Suggest that you start here and then wander through Insa-dong for a relaxing interesting cultural day out in Seoul"
8,4.0,"Although not up with perhaps the major palaces, it is still worth a visit, particularly as it is free and you are likely to be close by if you are visiting Insa-dong market.  Constructed in 1864, it is quite modern but you can wander around the ladies and mens quarters and see the various room settings with a reasonable degree of information in English (there is also an English leaflet at the information kiosk where you come in).  It shows the essence of palace life in a contained setting that will take you no more than 30 minutes to go around.  There is currently an exhibition of textiles to be used for the re-enactment of a wedding of a king and queen being held in April.  The woman who made the embroidery decorations for the robes was at the site and was happy to see overseas visitors.  The quality of the work was extremely fine."
9,4.0,"We can wear traditional Korean costume,and  can take some photos  for free.Fee for costume rental is not so expensive.Not crowdy,silent place.Children also can rental costume."
