0,5.0,"This is a fine little island park on Hangang(Han River) and is connected with the land by bridges.- Renovated and opened in 2002, there are still many people who don't know this place. I could find very few foreigners on the island as well.There's nothing much to have fun. There are a caf√© with a nice view, botanical garden, etc.- Since there's a much bigger Hangang Riverside Park before this, here's not that crowded.- Seeing some youngsters impersonating Japanese animation characters would be interesting.- You can take a look at both of north and south of Seoul.How to access:The entrance is on Yanghwadaegyo Bridge. Bus #7612 #5714 #603 #761. Walkable distance from Hapjeong Station.And there's the other high trail(Seonyugyo) to enter from south of Seoul. 15~20 min walk from Seonyudo Station."

It has a piano to play with and green house and museum to browse through.  We went there as a part of two day private tour with This is Korea.  Our tour guide Jay brought us there. We enjoyed it very much."
