The monuments here are really from the ancient times unlike some which are replicas. Quite intriguing. The stone pagoda was the same one seen in some old photos at the museum. In the past that was the tallest building in the area, now it's well surpassed by skyscrapers. The park is at the end of the insadong street, so you can easily continue to walk and stroll up insadong if you come from jongno3ga station to the park and link up to insadong street. Easy walk. Plenty of food around from restaurants , cafes to food carts."

When you enter the park you are able to view a map to orient yourself.  In reality you don't need it as the park is quiet and compact and filled with ordinary people relaxing under the trees.  The park has a historically important stone pagoda, great statuary and a very moving set of stone sculptures.  Visit it and spend the time its wonderful."

This is actually the historic site where 33 representatives the march 1st Movement of 1919 recited the Korean Declaration of Independence from Japan. We were there at the time of the celebrations for Buddha's Birthday so there were hundred of lanterns around the trees - very colourful. The park is small, tranquil  and relaxing."

However small it is, history actually happened here. This is a small park where you'll find the glass enclosed pagoda. It's also more relaxed and quiet here, a place to rest. It would be a shame to not drop by the park if you are already going to Insadong."
