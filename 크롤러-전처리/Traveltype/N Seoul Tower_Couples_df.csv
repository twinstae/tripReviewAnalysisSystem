0,5.0,"The Korean Drama that left the biggest impact on Namsam Tower to me is Legend of the Blue Sea! If you're a fan like me, don't miss this! Remember the scene when Sim Cheong told Heo Joon Jae to meet at Namsam Tower on the next first snow? She walked up the hill and he drove up but she got into an accident and didn't make it to the top. You definitely don't want to miss Heo Joon Jae. So let me share with you a tip: How to get to N Seoul Tower! Search on Kakao Map/Google Map: Namsan Ormi Elevator (Bottom Entrance) in my opinion this is the easiest way to get up! The Elevator is like a tram train, you'll be able to enjoy the surrounding view on your way up. Then follow the crowd and you'll get to N Seoul Tower! When leaving N Seoul Tower back to the city, i recommend to catch a bus to the nearest station depending on your next destination. The bus stop is just a stone throw away by walking down a short slope, do look out for bus stop signs :)"
1,4.0,"Located in a relatively central location in Seoul,no direct metro but can easily navigate your way there by alighting at Dongguk University stn, exit 6 n go to bus stop near Uni bridge. Take bus 2 n 4 to reach. Tower located at Namsan Mountain whereby one can take many nice photos. Tower visit itself is rather optional as the mountain already provide a fantastic view of the city. Defo worth a visit."
2,5.0,"I did not mind spending the money for the cable car ride or the ticket to the top. They view was absolutely worth the cost. The coffee shop at the top had *amazing* desserts, there were stools/tables to snack at, the 360 degree view was amazing, the elevators moving quickly, and the bathroom had quite the view.. seriously!"
3,4.0,"The prices for the ticket were a bit expensive, considering the surrounding attractions are significantly cheaper. We enjoyed the view though, and the many opportunities to grab a souvenir. Would definitely come back during a different season to see how the view would look during spring or summer."
4,3.0,The tower is interesting but probably not worth visiting unless you have a nice clear day.  It was dull the day we went and you couldn‚Äôt see much.
5,5.0,highly recommend to take this trip during night hours so you can actually see the city lit up. I would highly recommend spend the extra money to skip the line do to how busy it is. You can purchase locks there for $10 to place wherever you would like. If you go while it‚Äôs cooler outside dress warm it does get cold up there.
6,5.0,"Nice view , around the City. Local Customs is the attractive part of the place. Don‚Äôt forget for üíì key üîê"
7,5.0,"If in Seoul for a short period of time and not sure what to see definitely make your way to N. Seoul Tower.  From Myeong-dong, walk to the cable car and ride up from there. The views from the top are amazing."
8,4.0,"Its quite a ride to get to the tower but the stunning view, the adjoining Hello Kitty museum and Ryan's Cheezball Adventure is worth the effort. The all around view from the tower also tells you in which direction your country is from that spot and the distance too. It was an evening beautifully spent."
9,3.0,"Probably outshined by Lotte Tower which of course is bigger and badder but the wait times and surrounding area at N Tower are much better. There is good food, a bar, lovelocks and a trippy colors room before you enter the tower elevator."
10,4.0,Very touristy but you can see the whole city.  We walked up the mountain but realized afterward that there are 3 city buses that go to the top.
11,5.0,"Took the free Namsan Ormi Elevator from the street along where Shinsegae Dept Store was to the Cable Car Tower. Very convenient and save the hill climbing. Bought return cable car tickets for 2 adults at 19,000 Won.  Nice park where tower is. Spent half a day exploring it, including lunch at a nice Korean chicken and beer place in the plaza. Time well spent."
12,3.0,"Two options to the top of the tower, hike or take a cable car. We decided to take the cable car. After purchasing the tickets, we have to stand in a very long queue which goes up two floors to reach the cable car station. It too us 40 minutes before we got into the car. The ride was smooth, but the view from the car and from the tower is nothing special. We went there in the night expecting nice views, but there is too much light which prevents us from getting a good view of the city (see picture). Lot of young couples around who come to 'lock their love' on the railings of the tower using a paddlock. This seems to be a popular belief.  There are restaurants and souvenier shops in the tower."
13,5.0,The hike up the park alone was amazing although there are many ways to get to the base including a very scenic cable car.  It was so unexpected with interactive virtual reality and light shows before you even get to a 360 spectacular view of Seoul.  If you don‚Äôt do anything else do the Tower.   The price wasn‚Äôt bad and using a Visa card we received a few dollars off
14,4.0,"The tower offered great views of Seoul, even though it was a smoggy day. Ticketing was easy and relatively inexpensive.Just a warning, we used a bus to get here, and it was a pretty steep (though short) hill to climb from the bus stop to the tower"
15,3.0,"We stopped here as part of a tour, so we had our own usher who guided us to the elevators. The grounds are pleasant and parts of the old city wall can be seen in various places. The light show at the elevator was a bit much. The top floor with all the windows was filled with souvenir shops. Great views of the city, however"
16,5.0,Had a great time on a not bad day when visibility was okay. Lots of walking even with a lift to the station then cable ride to to the tower. Buy or bring couples lock and add to the collection.
17,5.0,"Very cheap to go up and worth it. We walked up (more strenuous than you think!) in about an hour, and got the cable car down."
18,5.0,"This is a great place to go if you love to walk and don‚Äôt mind a little steep hike. Once you get to the top the view is amazing! They‚Äôve got food and beverages at the top so don‚Äôt be too worried about that.. chicken and beer and coffee of course. Inside the north tower there are also restaurants however, they are very expensive. Once at the top of the north tower you get a beautiful view with clear windows that go around in a circle that also includes a candy shop and a place to write and send post cards. Interesting yet fun fact, the restrooms in the top of the north tower have glass walls! Yes , you‚Äôre read correctly! Glass walls. So you‚Äôre doing your business as you enjoy the view! üòÇ On a nice day this is a fantastic place to visit."
19,5.0,"Background: get all your information from the N Seoul Tower website.  Gettting there:  most convenient is to catch the shuttle buses described in the website.  They drive a circular route, so if you catch it at the beginning of the circle just after it has descended from Namsan Hill, it will be quite a lengthy ride of over half an hour before you get to the top of the hill.  The best part is that it terminates at the base of the Tower.  All other public transportation terminates at the base of the hill.  Cable car:  most directions will lead you to the north base of hill where the cable car is located.  It will transport you up the hill to the base of the tower. It is a pleasant ride but reputedly has long lines. If you are staying in Namdaemun or Myeongdong, it is an easy 20 or 15 minute walk respectively to here.For the mountain climbers: 1. walk up the stairs adjacent to the cable car. 2. walk up the LONG road that the shuttle buses drive up.  3. search for typically unmarked nature trails that will take you up the hillAt the base of tower:  splurge and get in the VIP line by having lunch at N Grill.Best time to go: avoid the teeming masses by going at midday on a weekday.So we caught a shuttle bus on a Friday, zipped up to N Grill for lunch.  Enjoyed a serene and delightful lunch with a view, then took the elevator down to the observatory for the touristy stuff.  A wonderful 2 to 3 hours.  Thereafter walked down the steps, continued north which dropped us right into Myeondong."
20,3.0,"We went up the tower and have a look at the love locks. While looking around, I failed to see a 15 cm step down which caused me to fall down. So always look down as well while you are enjoying the view!"
21,4.0,"We visited on a Sunday morning and there were pretty long queues for the cable car so took a while to get up. Queues were small to get up and down the tower though. There are great views of Seoul from the tower, but the whole experience is a bit tacky with lots of food outlets & souvenir shops around the base, plus all the locks on the fences.Enjoyed seeing the beehive beacons and city wall, and the wishing pig. Also the rainbow ice creams are lovely."
22,4.0,"I went after dark to see the lights. The Seoul skyline is impressive. There are some food shops in the observation desk, candy, gift shop etc.There is a pretty long line coming down so be prepared to wait.We took the cable car up and back. At times they jam 40 people in the cars depending on the day so if you hate being a sardine,  wait .Overall, worthwhile trip."
23,5.0,"Was a good relaxing environment to catch sunset, they have different areas to enjoy the attraction. There were gift shops  restaurants... we enjoyed the candy shop at the observation deckü§£"
24,1.0,"Huge disappointment.Went to the cablecart to get there but it was closed due to strong winds (s**t happens) so we had to take the bus.The line for the bus was massive, took 60min of waiting.After the bus drive headed to the tower, took the elevator up, collected our tickets and was informed that there was another 40min wait before we could take the elevator up to the observation deck.After the 40min wait you take the elevator up to a room with 360 projectors showing random animated movies on the walls, to distract you from the 30min addition waiting time here.When you finally reach the observation deck, you can barely see out the windows as the lights from all the souvenir shops there are reflecting in the glass.As a result of this the windows were full of finger prints and nose prints from people trying to see anything, and the windows weren't cleaned.After this disappointing experience we decided to head out again, only to find another 30min wait to get down! üôÑSummary of time waste:Bus             60minEntrance.   40minEntrance 2 30minExit             20minSpend your time on something else."
25,1.0,"We're not gonna complain about the hours it took to get to the observatory because had it been a good experience we would've forgot about the hasssle; but it was not! Once we reached the observatory, we couldn't enjoy the view as the reflection of the food and drinks' station light on the windows ruined the view let alone how dirty the windows were! AVOID!"
26,5.0,"Was a big walk up, we chose not to take the sky lift, take plenty of water and good shoes. Its doable though and worth the good work out. Great views by the time you get to the top the tower is more like a lighthouse, so don't be worried if issues with heights. Beautiful views, worth seeing!"
27,4.0,"The tower gives a great opportunity for fantastic views over the city. Even at base level the views are great but the 360 view from the observatory is better. However, its not the cheapest of venues to visit - so make sure its a clear day, else it's an expansive cloud view.There ate various floors of food stalls & kid activities"
28,5.0,"Namsam tower is a must go not only for locals but visitors alike, especially I you're looking for a romantic scenery. Although it can get a bit crowded sometime, it is well worth the travel at least once in your life. It's not only for couples so don't feel left out if you are alone. If you are a couple, bring a lock with you to ""secure"" your love on a rail fence at the top. My suggestion is to go right before sunset instead of daytime, the city lights is very beautiful so you can observe both day and night while you're up there."
29,3.0,"Well, you gotta do it when in Seoul, right? Trouble is, everyone else had the same idea, so it was 'rammed' at the top. Terrific view, though, as you'd expect, although the glare from the gift shops reflects a bit too much on the windows at night-time, spoiling photos a little. I'm glad we went; but it was just ok, and didn't 'wow'-me."
30,4.0,"üéã‚ô®Ô∏è‚úàÔ∏è N Seoul TowerSituated near Mount Namsan, or Nam Mountain,nestled in Namsan Park,this was Korea‚Äôs, perhaps the first integrated transmission tower and Seoul‚Äôs first broadcasting tower. How to get there!? Well for the sporty kinds, one could hike, for the rest,one could take a bus or hail a cab to the cable car station. From the cable car station one could continue hiking up the steep hill or take the cable car and breathe in the breathtaking view of the city. Best time to visit, is late evening, so that one could capture the twinkling lights of the city below.After demounting the car, there is a walk up a few stairs to a landing with ice cream shops. The landing is indeed pretty, with cartoon characters constructed around benches and love birds locking the locks around the railing as a tribute or a promise to each other.Once you move towards the second landing or the terrace, you see a beautiful sitting area surrounded by trees and yet again you see, beautiful locks attached or lovers attaching to a padlock to the, ‚ÄúLocks of Love Seoul Railing‚Äù. As One could also buy heart-shaped coins to throw into the Wishing Pond in hopes of finding eternal love.The terrace has a sitting area, an eatery and a shopping center. The upper deck of the terrace has a huge  heart shaped structure. You can click a  romantic picture or two with it as a background.The ride up the  elevator to the observatory gives you an awe inspiring panoramic,360-degree view of Seoul.The revolving restaurant and Grill at the tower‚Äôs top story without doubt gives you an imposing and magnificent view of the bejewelled sprawling city below."
31,1.0,We planned an afternoon visit. If you are hard of walking like my partner or pregnant like myself this is not recommended. The queue to get tickets for the cable car is extremely long and in this Seoul late summer heat is was unbearable. The queue moves quickly however there is no coordination and it seems people just stand everywhere. Once tickets are bought you queue to get up to the cable car. As My boyfriend has a walking issue and I am pregnant we got the lift up however if this wasn‚Äôt the case you had to queue round the stairs of the building standing whilst waiting. The cable car itself is a nice experience if you enjoy heights and it has a nice view. Once you‚Äôre at the bottom of the tower it is equally as busy. We bought tickets to go up the tower at 6.40pm. We did not make it to the observation deck until 8.30pm.The boarding system is amongst all of the shops and cafes and it is a SHAMBLES. It‚Äôs very very very busy with very limited seating and as I say in this heat it is not enjoyable. You then queue to get to the observation deck once you have boarded and this again takes forever. Once you reach the observation deck it is just so busy you cannot enjoy the view. We spent maybe 10 mins before trying to make our way down - only to find the queue for the elevator down was roughly 45/60 mins long.Overall a wasted day.
32,5.0,Went on a sunday night - the queue for the cable car was huge! We waited about 40 minutes. The view from the top is amazing though - we were fortunate with the weather too.
33,5.0,The view was incredible and it was not too scary for someone with a fear of heights! Ticket price was cheap and so was the restaurant next to the tower. There was even somewhere to write and send postcards inside!
34,4.0,"Make the hike up if it‚Äôs not unbearably humid/hot, it‚Äôs a nice walk up from Myeong-dong, doesn‚Äôt cost much to go up, and has great views of the city! Personally I‚Äôd avoid any cafes/restaurants at the tower and head back down to Myeong-dong for food."
35,5.0,"Greater after renovated. The tower has many gimmick along the way to the top. - star ocean room- the 360 angle projection mapping room- even the ceiling of the elevator have the vdo while it elevating.  Make you feeling excitement.- great view, of course- great air"
36,5.0,"Seoul toweris situated at the top of the Seoul. There are love locks for the couples. So many locks were locked at this place, thousands of them. The beauty is awesome. Must visit during nights."
37,5.0,"Its a must on Seoul beautiful view, you need to take a cable car (which is full) and seems shuttle are also available. Once up you need to buy another ticket to get to the top, can take another 20 or 30 minutes.There are restaurants souvenirs. Before getting to the top of the tower theres an awesome video mapping show it worth to stay and watch them all, excellent job.On top of the tower crowded as any other landmark, will auggest to avoid on cloudy or rainy days"
38,5.0,10 minute less taxi ride from Myeongdong. No long line ups. Locks and pens can be purchased at the location relatively pricy.
39,5.0,"Must visit in any time of the day.The Hello Kitty shop is super cute, the ""love"" locks and basically all the area around is Amazing~ oh and of course don't   forget the once in a lifetime   view of the tower's last floor Simply a must ‚ô°"
40,4.0,"High with a beautiful sight over the entire city! We loved the signs on the windows that took us ‚Äòhome‚Äô. I personally do not like all the souvenirshops, but a lot of people do, so it seems to be a ‚Äòthing‚Äô fot lots of us?But the view is great, go there when the weather is bright!"
41,5.0,"A tower located on the Namsan Hill. You can get here in various ways. We went by cable car, which station is located about 15 minutes' walk from Myeong-Dong subway station (line 4). The tower top is reached by an elevator. From above there is a great view of Seoul, you can also eat something in the restaurant at the top of the tower."
42,5.0,"N Seoul Tower, what more can i say? It has a certain romantic feeling to it, yes also known to be the hotspot to get engaged , it really is a sentiment, the facility caters for all ages and all walks of life, the N Seoul tower has tons of restaurants, and gift shops up in the tower and also out, there is also a game arcade, restrooms and of course, accommodating the most beautiful veiw and prospect of Seoul, getting to the destination itself was not a hassle depending on where you stay in Korea, you can always catch a bus at Dongguk, but getting up to the tower requires abit of foot work and good old hiking shoes, or any type of shoe that won't have you slip on it's inclined path, but the little hike is all worth it!! The entrance fee is reasonable, about 10000 won and you'll always be entertained in the towers elevator, the tower assistant were helpful, friendly, organized and structured, it can be abit overcrowded up in the tower, but it still IS A STUNNING VEIW"
43,5.0,"A must see for the sights as well as sounds (on the path we spotted interesting birds and spiders). Bring enough drinks, stay hydrated. Stop at the shop, some cute crafts and stylish earings!"
44,4.0,"We opted to walk from the nearest metro station all the way to the top and were pleasantly surprised to find that the road up is not actually that long. It is steep for sure but goes quite quickly and I am a slow walker. The tower itself was impressive and we opted to go up onto the paid-for viewing levels. It was quite busy but not too bad in comparison to the free lower levels. The view was great and it was a nice clear day so we could see quite far. The tower had a handful of restaurant options including a great fried chicken place but don't order the ""seasoned"" chicken unless you are aiming to clog your arteries because WOW, there was a lot of sweet sticky sauce on there. Apparently ""seasoned"" in South Korea does not been herbs, it means sauce - we found out the hard way. The Starbucks on the lower levels where you get the tickets has a nice outdoor seating area that we enjoyed as well."
45,4.0,"Although it is the landmark of the city (somehow), the idea is bigger than the realty, nice steep walk to the tram or cable car, not far from the main avenue. Price might be slightly higher for what you get, once up there, it is wide and open, lots of rrom to roam around, shops and restaurants available and options for video and photos as well. Good place to visit."
46,5.0,We really enjoyed our time there. We went up by hiring a private taxi from Klook along with the ticket to enter the tower.If you wanna partipate in lock with your partner. I recommend not buying from there it cost to much.You can chill out in the twosome cafe and have fun.Generally a great place to chill. If you have elderly please consider using the cable car.
47,4.0,"The tower has great views of Seoul. We took the cable car up and walked back to the bus for our return to the city.Lots of options to get there, things to see, coffee and food available to enjoy while you take in the view, even the toilet as a view:)"
48,4.0,"They seem to think this tower can compete with worldwide tall buildings. It‚Äôs laughably short, but compared to the other buildings in the city, it does provide a nice view of the city. We did a beer and popcorn package, but if you don‚Äôt get it to take up (we wanted to sit and enjoy) you have to take a long trip back after the ride up and down"
49,4.0,"While there is a cost to go to the top, the mid-levels are fun, with nice views and lots of entertainment going on during the day."
50,3.0,"N Seoul Tower provides great views of the city (on a clear day).  This is not our thing; ergo the rating.  There is a lot of activity in the tower, and there are lots of people--both tourists and locals.  We suspect that it might be better to visit in the evening."
51,4.0,"Went up by cable car, was a very interesting experience!There are LOADS of locks couples put everywhere. They put it on stair railings, poles, anywhere they possibly can. Bring your own lock!We didn‚Äôt buy a ticket up the tower. The view from below was already amazing!"
52,5.0,Get an uninterrupted view of Seoul from the tower. The whole place and gardens below are beautiful. From the bus stop the walk up the hill is reasonably steep but it takes only 5 minutes to reach the ticket office and elevator. Wear good gripping shoes as down is as hard as up. Worth a visit for sure.
53,4.0,"The N Seoul Tower is such a prominent landmark that you will just have to see it, and the best time to go is before sunset. The light on the Tower is an indication of the current air quality: from blue to red. It was green (normal air quality) during our visit.We‚Äôd visited the tower as part of a half day tour. From the bus station to the base of the Tower there is a steep slope going up leading to a viewing platform.The view from the observatory was stunning - you get a all around view of Seoul. Even the men‚Äôs toilet get a ‚Äúframed up‚Äù views."
54,4.0,We visited busan tower and didn‚Äôt think this was as good...if per chance you plan to visit both then do the photo challenge and if luckily you‚Äôll get a buy one get one free ticket for the other tower! We got to the tower from the cable car. There‚Äôs restaurants and shops at the bottom of it. The lift wizzes you up. The views are great. The skyline I think is wonderful and the views to the river are great too. There‚Äôs a shop up there. There‚Äôs also a Korean buffet restaurant and then higher up is a fine dining French restaurant. I heard someone say to a traveller not to bother going up the tower but I certainly would - the views are great and you can‚Äôt experience it anywhere else.
55,5.0,Went up by cable car during the evening. The cable car ride was quite worrying as there were 20+ people cramped into a carriage and some of us were wondering aloud if this was our last day on earth lol. There are places for you to place a love lock at the summit with your significant other. The view from the tower itself is superb. We were there to watch the sunset and the night cityscape and the silhouettes of the mountains surrounding Seoul makes for a breathtaking sight. Expensive but still a must visit in my opinion.
56,3.0,"After going up countless towers on a tour of Japan and Korea, perhaps this was a ‚Äòtower too far‚Äô. So I accept that this may influence this review. We had to wait 30 minutes at the cable car before we could get up. The Q down was even worse, so it‚Äôs quicker and more fun to walk down. Once at the top the views are great, but it was a little rainy when we visited so the view was not as good as I‚Äôm sure it is on a sunny day - so keep a look out for the weather forecast before deciding which day to visit (on our second day in Seoul it was completely enveloped in cloud). Well worth visiting, none the less....how can you come to Seoul and not say you‚Äôve been up the tower??"
57,4.0,"We hiked up the mountain using a stairway path. It was a hard hike! But once we got to the top there were lots of things to do. I think the coolest part was seeing all the ""locks of love"" at the top. There's a lot of restaurants up there and we went to Tokyo Steak which I highly recommend.If you go, try to go on a clear day. We went when it was overcast and a lot of pollution was trapped so the view of the city wasn't good at all."
58,3.0,We made the journey to the tower giving ourselves plenty time but disappointed to find the ticket booth had closed early. We were also ushered away from a viewing deck despite it being quite a bit before the displayed closing time. We did have a bit of a wander about where we could including the love locks so it wasn‚Äôt a wasted journey.
59,4.0,There was a slight uphill walk to get to the base of tower. Some lovely views of the city from the Tower.
60,5.0,I love this place getting there was as much fun as the attraction lots to do great views and plenty of great pictures The lines can be very long depending on the time of year you visit You can walk but we took a cab and then used the cable tram to get to the top.The lines for tickets and tram can get long just keep that in mind.We spent about 4 hours at this attraction
61,3.0,"I really had high expectations of this place since I had read so much about it and being a K-drama fan, I thought it would be a wonderful and a romantic place. Well,maybe it would have been different if we went up the other way with the cable car but we went up there as past of a half-day tour. First of all, you can't get up to the tower area itself without walking up or taking a city bus or being part of a tour. No cars are allowed. That part was okay as we did go up by bus. What was disappointing was that it seemed very commercialized. There was a fee to go  to the top of the tower. That was understandable but then.they take a photo of you when you enter which of course comes with a price tag. And it was extra to go into the Hello Kitty area which seemed like a promo store??? We didn't go in. Don't get me wrong, the view was nice from the top and outside where you have the love locks and park area. I guess I'm just a bit jaded because of my disappointment. Maybe it would have been nicer to go in the evening with all the lights. But to me-you do it once..."
62,5.0,Beautiful view and relaxing üòå up here!! On the way up here they have many cute coffee ‚òïÔ∏è shop and some good snack too !! Best way to come up here from your hotel is Taxi üöñ!!!
63,5.0,"While the tower itself is like most viewing towers, the whole experience is unique. You start from the walk up to the cable car centre. Then there is the joy of taking the cable car up to the base of the tower. Once you arrive on the other side, there are lots of picture spots and also an area where couples place locks with their names written on it (like in Paris).On the top of the tower, you have a 360 degree view of Seoul from viewing platform. There is this machine which is linked to the viewing tower located in Busan (southern part of South Korea), where you can interact with visitors who are there."
64,5.0,The view from observatory deck is fantastic.. It worth to visit.. It easy to access from itaewon by bus no 03 and from myeongdong bus no 05..
65,4.0,Was happy that our guide was able to drive us almost to the top where the views were good but because of the haze rather restricted distant views
66,2.0,"Got off  seoul ststion subway to walk to hilton bus stop up hill to find out bus stop a block away from hilton. Then bus 402 takes us to 2nd stop,  which gps said to get off on, to find it in middle of no where. So we walk back to 1st stop to walk what was around a mile up a 45 degree incline...yes it sucked ass. But the best part was it smelled like sewer the whole way. When we finally got to the top it was definitely not worth the effort. Moral of story is research a better way to the top because u will be sweaty, thirsty, and exhausted if you take the walking route."
67,4.0,"Really beautiful, we went during the day however I think at night would be spectacular. Also don‚Äôt go on a day where there is dust, as the view isn‚Äôt good on a day where there is a lot of pollution."
68,5.0,"Use the cable car going up, you can easily walk down on your way back. This site will show you how big and wide and how progressive Seoul is. It‚Äôs really impressive, and the site itself is a mix representation of Korea, very advance but they have cultural presentations scattered around the area too. This is the best place to take selfies and the background views are pretty impressive. Don‚Äôt miss it..."
69,5.0,Really nice place with beautiful night scenery. Took a cable car up and the night view was awesome. Be sure to lock down your love with a padlock there!
70,5.0,"Really great views, people watching, coffee and <some> food options up top. We walked/hiked up (paved) through what's l like a linear garden with fresh air and nice views. Then pay to go up to the top, the views of the enormous Seoul metropolitan area are outstanding! Top it off with the cable car ride down, but note that's quickly over."
71,3.0,Only stay up there for a short while. Nothing fanciful. Head straight to the ticket booth to purchase your ticket as you will be given a number and you got to wait for your number to be called.
72,4.0,I would recommend visiting this place during day time for better photo taking. The hotel I stayed in Tmark Grand Hotel is very near to the tower and we got on a direct bus just in front of the hotel. Easy and convenient. The love lock area is always packed with tourists and quite difficult to find a nice spot to take pictures. We only stayed for less than 3 hrs including a short coffee break.
73,5.0,The Hop On & Off Bus makes a stop here.  Gorgeous view from the top.  It was a great day weather wise.  The tulips were in full bloom as well as the cherry blossoms.Don‚Äôt forget to use the restroom inside at the top to take in another great view.
74,3.0,Limited interest as very touristic place with many fast food restaurants and gift shops. The panoramic view is nice by clear weather and you can really see the dimension of the city. To do if you have time to waste but not a must do.
75,5.0,I got here by subway than catch a shuttle bus no3 to come up here. Be there around 3.30 pm I saw some traditional performance. Then walk around the place. I brought the e-ticket from trip.com got some discount. The top of the observer floor you can see the Seoul city in 360 degrees make sure go down there on a clear day! On the way down I walk to the Library direction very nice cherry blossoms trees the biggest tree I have ever seen.
76,3.0,We took the cable car to Namsan park. It was a uphill climb to the cable car station. The view at the lower deck is sufficient for us. We did not go to the observation deck. Be there early to avoid the crowds as there were bus loads of tourist when we left the place at around 11 plus. There are three buses available at the bus stop which can bring you to selected train stations.
77,4.0,"Well, we do not choose to go up by skycab. we walk up from Namsan park. it was a right decision we made! Namsan park is abeautiful park and nice place to see sunset. we visited during the evening. and when reach the N tower, the night view of Namsan City really make us feel great! in cold, looking at the nice city night view, feel like you empty your mind. i think it is one of the best spot for city night view sightseeing in Seoul"
78,5.0,"Get your bearings for this vast city from the top. Take the cable car up, and a slow walk down with memorable views of the city. Specially during spring blossom period."
79,5.0,Seeing the whole Korea was fun. Travelling through cable car is more fun too. Lots of restaurant to choose from is a plus.
80,3.0,"Well, what to say really?  Yes, it's obvious what the place is, it's a VERY popular tower on top of a mountain with viewing platform and restraunts up there.  An yes, Korean restraunt up there was really nice and I'll review that separately.  But as for the tower, the queue for the cable car up was easily 30 minutes, problems more like 40 plus, and this was a Sunday night.  Don't be fooled by the queue for the tickets on ground level, that's just the start of your long, long quest to the top of the building, to get the cable car to the top of the mountain.  I call it a quest, as it's almost something worthy of two small hobbits.  I had read reviews that mentioned the queues, however I didn't quite read in enough detail to prepare for the queues that lay ahead, and I'm British, we're known for queueing, but I now think we should be handing that title for the Koreans.Then, once you finally get on the cable car and get to the top of the mountain, you can stop and have a look at the views from there, and then queue a further 40 minutes for the lifts up the tower proper.  Now a good tip here, is to book a restaurant package to go up the tower, as this skips the lift queue up for you.View from the top is nice, but without the restaurant meal, it would have menat 80 minutes plus of queueing to get there.Then, to come down, repeat all the queuing again, so it was 40 miuntes to the bottom of the tower, which sadly the restaurant meal does not enable you to skip, and then another 40 minutes for the cable car.  I know there's a bus to the top that misses the cable car, and we didn't try those so can't comment.  If you're feeling adventurous, you can also climb the mountain on foot, althouh we thought that for an evening dinner out that might be a bit much.Overall a nice view, if you patient enough for the queues."
81,4.0,Great view good for tourist to spent time here =DHave variety of food too and money changer if u need.
82,4.0,"My husband and I hiked up to Seoul Tower. It was a bit of hike; however, the result was great. The view of the city was great even though it was a bit cloudy. There are several restaurants to choose from. Great for a few hours our of your day!"
83,4.0,"We didn‚Äôt pay for the tickets to go up since the view from the bottom was already nice.I took the cable car up to Seoul tower. There were so people walk up which was free and they can also saw the view while they were walking. We took the cable car down and there was a lift took us to the street. (See the last photo). Overall, it‚Äôs worthy to have a look while we were in Seoul."
84,4.0,We went at night time and it was a lovely clear evening so the view was good. You catch the cable car up. If you are a senior 65 or over you get a discount. The locks of love are there and there must be millions of them. It should take you no more than an hour ago do this activity.
85,5.0,"We are from the United States, so we're not able to really plan this visit around the weather. If you go, be sure to go on a clear day. We were lucky to have great visibility the day we went. The ""locks of love"" was great as well. We had no idea about it before going, and. were able to participate in it by adding a lock for us. Worth going for sure!"
86,4.0,"I've been here twice, once in the evening and once in the day.  From the entrance to the tower, you can appreciate the cityscape of Seoul and it's a great view. It doesn't cost much to go up the tower (only 10000 KRW per person, plus there is a bundle of 2 popcorns + 2 beers for 26000 KRW which we availed of). The top of the tower itself was quite small, in terms of circumference.  Only housing a candy store and a souvenir shop were located at the main viewing deck, with a non-advertised coffee shop at the lower floor which we would've gone to and stayed at if we had only known (they're the only accessible non-restaurant establishment with seats).  It was a great experience but it's more than enough to go up the tower once, no need to do it again and again."
87,3.0,"we took the Namsan Circular Bus (yellow bus no 05) up to the top of the mountain, it was the cheapest mode to get there (other than hiking up on your own). the view from the namsan mountain was spectacular."
88,4.0,"If you‚Äôre into city views, I recommend visiting Seoul Tower. Unlike the typical skyscraper in every major city; Seoul Tower somehow engages the tourist by setting up multiple activities to partake along the way up. There‚Äôs multiple platforms to sit or take pictures prior to entering Seoul tower. Also, there‚Äôs love locks attached to the fence panels. Travelers could take bus or the Gondola (~$10 USD) up to Seoul Tower.Key Note: If you arrive late near closing time, the gondola that takes you down will have a long line. If you want to enjoy your date night and stay up late at night; you could always take the bus down. It's safe but it's a longer wait for the bus."
89,4.0,"A must visit place for us since its like an SOP whenever we visit another country. Go to their tower! N Seoul Tower didn‚Äôt disappoint us. It was a short cable car ride up and when you get there they have the Lovelock platform where visitors make a wish in a padlock and lock it in the railings. It‚Äôs pretty cool and the place is filling up..I wonder what it would be like in the next 10 yearsüòÇ. Since it‚Äôs winter when we visited, it was freezing to the point you really wanna get out of there. We decided not to go to the tower itself and just enjoyed the view of Seoul in the viewing platform. It‚Äôs a good place to visit especially if you‚Äôre in Seoul for a very short visit. They have different tickets for the cable car ride and different ticket going in to the tower. Quite expensive but you can just stay in the viewing platform and enjoy the view."
90,4.0,"We took the cable cart up to N Seoul Tower.We didn't actually go inside however just walked around, took in the spectacular views. We then chose to walk back down and not take the cable car down as we enjoy walking. It was a nice walk and along the way there was a cool free workout park. there was multiple bench press', sit up benches, weight machines etc. We stopped and did a 45 minute workout before continuing back down the hill,"
91,4.0,"Went there to celebrate my birthday. Fees for cable car, observatory deck and other attractions are quite expensive however, your Seoul tour won't be complete if you don't go to this famous tower."
92,4.0,"If you are couple, don‚Äôt forget to bring lock or you can buy it upstairs. Buy the lock at the entrance of cable car will be cheaper then upstairs.I went there through cable car. It‚Äôs great and enough for me. We don‚Äôt go to the top of the tower.But playing around at the bottom is enough (at least for me), there are several restaurant that you can choose."
93,3.0,We came here in the evening on a Friday night and it was crowded! There‚Äôs also no taxis that we could take to go back to our hotel üè® because we had been on a DMZ tour that day & just want to get back to the hotel as soon as we could. I think it would be better to come here during the day.
94,4.0,You can walk to the tower but its hard up hill.we got the cable car with was 9500won each but well worth it .before you go up the tower you can take nice photos of seoul.it costs 10000won each to get the lift to the top of the tower.the views are great seeing all seoul right back to the mountains.you can walk round the platform 360degree.there are lots of shops cafe and places to eat but a little bit pricey.it would be hard for a wheelchair.but a must thing to do if your in seoul.
95,4.0,"I spent 24 hours in Seoul and this was the first place I went. It was night, and really cold, but the view is good, you can see quite a lot of Seoul and the surrounding area. It's a very popular place, and there are lines to do basically everything, like take the cable car to the top of the park, take the elevator up to the observation deck in the tower, and take the elevator back down."
96,4.0,The N Seoul Tower is a very touristy spot on top of a hill but even though it‚Äòs quite expensive I‚Äòd recommend it to everyone. The place is especially nice for couples because there is a spot where you can buy ‚Äûlove locks‚Äú and hang them up for good luck in a relationship.Was nice and I‚Äòd definetly recommend it for couples.
97,4.0,We visited this place during winter and I honestly dont have a feel for shopping that time because it was too cold for asian born in tropical country. The best thing that you can do here during winter is to have a taste of its street foods
98,4.0,"We took a bus up to the mountain followed by a stroll up the slope to the tower. We could view the city not only from the observatory deck but also from the toilet while doing business! It‚Äôs interesting! Once done going round seeing city from all angles, you could order a cup of coffee, sit by the window and enjoy the drink plus views! Very relaxing!The sight of love locks makes you wonder why people locked their love there? Isn‚Äôt that ....."
99,5.0,Can view how the city is divided by the river. Contrast of old and new building. Meantime have the famous corner of locks.. u can see messages of people to their love 1 or couple. Since we follow tour. We don't have much time to walk around and read but we have nice view as you can see from my pictures. Love the winter view. Imaging it full with snow. Even more lovely.
100,3.0,"This was nice to visit but will take you a bit of time (would recommend about 2-3 hours total).If you choose to take the gondola up (most popular option, you can walk which is about 30 minutes but not sure what the track is like), which will cost you 9,500 won return. We waited in line for about 30 minutes for our tickets, and then there was a further wait time of 40 minutes to actually get on the gondola. The view from the top was lovely."
101,4.0,"You can see Namsan Tower from standing everywhere in Seoul, it's that huge and built on a slope. We went to the very top of this tower, which provides a beautiful 360 degree view of Seoul, South Korea. Another thing that Namsan tower is famous for is locking love locks. There must be  million of colorful locks."
102,3.0,"This tower is pretty much the same as any tower you find throughout your travels. The unique thing about it is around it. Leading up to the tower are hundreds of locks with couples names on them that are locked on the guard railings. There are some restrictions for those putting theirs up and if you don't follow their rules, your lock will be removed at the end of the night. Good view from the tower of the City but like every other tourist stop, a bit over priced. Entrance fee is separate from the cable car ride getting there."
103,4.0,"Perched comfortably atop the Namsan mountain this tower provides unparalleled views of the Seoul metro area. One can get to the observation deck in USD 10, and you can also add some combos which include lunch plus drink sets.Accessible by cable car from Myeong-dong, or by public Bus, or even you a mild 30-minute hike. Look out for the special beacon fire lighting ceremony dates to make your visit even more rewarding."
104,4.0,"I took a bus up and enjoyed the views and the place totally. I do not see a point in buying a ticket to enter the tower. Nonetheless, I enjoyed every corner of Namsam. There‚Äôs a cultural show from 3-4 pm everyday (except Mondays). I chose to take a walk down which took me 30 mins but the views were great."
105,4.0,This is one of the must visit place in Seoul. We took a private tour to get there. The weather was sunny and cold. Managed to see clear and beautiful city skyline. Recommend place to visit.
106,5.0,"Another reviewer said ""...Yes, there is a cable car. But the hike is very easy - it's reasonably flat and you get pretty good views all the way up.""  That is what it said in the book on Seoul that I bought in Honolulu before going to Seoul.  My wife and I found the opposite to be true.  I took as 3 hours to get from where out taxi dropped us off to the top.  In retrospect there was a Bus stop sign at the bottom but no idea when it might come so we elected to walk.  Three hours later (with seven yellow busses passing us going up during the time it took us to walk there) we arrived with my wife very sore legs and mad.  ""Reasonably Flat""... I don't think so.. I would call it steep. Once we finally arrived it was nice. We went to the upper level W 10,000 each, and got a framed souvenir photo W 25,000 which was nice... you can choose your background of views from the tower.  Unfortunately, it was very cloudy that day, and we couldn't see much of anything of the city from the tower, but they did warn us about that before charging us to go to the upper level, and after that hike we wanted to go up anyway. I think i would be spectacular when it is not cloudy... it was just our bad luck the weather was like that.  I hope someday we can go there when the weather is good!We enjoyed the fence where the lovers attach the padlocks with their names together and took some pictures there, and the Vanilla Shake at the Ice Cream concession was delicious.We decided to take the cable car back down, which was scenic, but we found that once we arrived it was a long walk to MyongDong Subway Station, which the map implies was colocated with the Cable Car terminal... it is not.It is also a steep road from the Cable Car terminal down, so if you were going to walk up from the MyongDong Subway Station to the cable car terminal it would be quite a hike... although certainly less than the alternative hiking trail.If we go there again I would either:1. Wait for the Yellow Bus at the bottom of the Hiking Trail where the taxi dropped us off ... I think he sign at the top said the Bus was only W 1,200 or something like that.OR2. Insist that the taxi take you all the way to the Cable Car terminal... and get the hotel or somebody to write that in Korean to show the driver since it appears none of the taxi driver's understand English.The fare for the Cable Car is almost the same for round trip as one way, so IF you can be sure the taxi will take you all the way to the Cable Car terminal that is probably the best choice.  Otherwise the Yellow Bus from the bottom of the hiking trail.Aside from that I agree with all the other observations of the review by EmmaVestrheim."
107,4.0,"Spent the day hiking and visiting the N Seoul Tower.GETTING THEREYes, there is a cable car. But the hike is very easy - it's reasonably flat and you get pretty good views all the way up. Once at the tower, you need to buy a ticket to go to the observation deck. There is a shopping mall below, so choose to visit that either before or after the observation deck. Then you join the queue, get your photo taken (optional), and then take the lift to the top. Once at the top, there are three different floors full of restaurants and shops. Tip: If you have Lonely Planet, they have an excellent self-guided walking tour that's very easy to do. It includes a visit to the Old City Wall. CROWDSIt's *so* crowded. Be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes in queues for food, shops, and finding a spot to take photos.VIEWSIncredible!Tip: Want to get good views but be away from crowds? We went to the Hancook restaurant where it was VERY quiet. We then sat there, ate slowly, and watched the sunset from our own table in our own space. It's much better then nudging people out of the way on the main floors. FOODFirst we got beer + chips from a coffee shop, and the chips were laughably bad. Then we went and hid in the Hancook restaurant, which was a little overpriced but nice and quiet. We got our own table overlooking the city. SOUVENIR SHOPPINGSome of the best souvenirs I've seen in Seoul! Did all my shopping there."
108,5.0,N Seoul Tower is worth a visit. You can pay to go to the top or just enjoy the views from the many free viewing platforms lower down or within the park itself. There is plenty going on day and night with organised performances or just people hanging out taking photos in the different areas. The all you can eat buffet is excellent value before 5pm when the price increases significantly. A good day out for those on a budget.
109,5.0,"I generally skip towers when I visit new places because I have been to so many and they tend to be just waiting in line, going up for two seconds and then going back down. This one was a much nicer experience. There is a cafe at the top and you can kind of hang out for a bit. Also, the area at the bottom of the tower was really nice and had great views as well."
110,5.0,Romantic place to visit. You can find many photo spots here especially the lock bridge. Many dramas have taken scenes here also.The admission fee is moderate around 10.000Won (less expensive than Lotte Tower). Worth to visit while you are in SK.My advice is visit this place when the weather is clear unless you want see foggy Seoul
111,5.0,"A must trip to get a perspective of the city's density, river, and mountains. Get there early to see the sunset, you won't be disappointed.  You can get there by public transportation, and take the combination elevator- cable car or hike up."
112,5.0,"Went to check the tower just because, thinking it's just like any other landmark tower. Proved myself wrong because the park is actually a great place to hangout and have a picnic. Views of the city is breathtaking. There's a lot to do in the park and includes hiking."
113,3.0,Way too crowded by local and tourist. Have to queue pretty long to get in the elevator for going both up and down the observatory tower. Somehow it's worth the walk for namsam park and the city night scene.
114,4.0,"Last time we visited and dine there at night. This time we visited there in the afternoon for a different feel & view ^ ^ Under a very good weather the Tower, trees & leaves, environment are spectacular ^ ^See the photos I posted to feel what we felt > <"
115,5.0,"My partner and I went to the N Soeul Tower in the afternoon and stayed until night so we could take a lot of pictures. You can go there by walking through the Namsan Park, cable car or by bus. We took the cable car. It was a nice experience. Even the toilet has a great view of the city. Also the Roof terrace of locks of love was nice. We bought a love lock and lock our love there. Next time when we visit Seoul we will visit Namsan Park."
116,3.0,It looks like the visit to this site is always part of the tour package.We arrived in the evening and the view at the site was good.It's now not the highest tower as most countries trying to compete to build tallest towers.The 360 degree view was interesting.
117,3.0,Gives widespread view of Seoul. Rather old fashioned with comparison to similar towers (Sydney for example). The concept is well understood after 5 minutes. nothing else to be done next. consider skipping this site.
118,4.0,Worth the visit. We went at sunset and enjoy 360‚Ä¢ view on seoul. The city is big and nice especially by night. We used the elevator then the car cable and it was great (30 mn waiting)
119,4.0,We visited the tower in the later part of the evening and did not have much of a line at all for the cable car ride up to the tower. The view was beautiful and clear and a little windy. I would definitely recommend this to someone visiting Seoul for the first time. They have a gift shop at the top for you to check out.
120,4.0,"We went at 10:15am, just after the 10am opening time. The tower was still fairly quiet, no queues, and we enjoyed the view. Having said that, the experience is quite cheesy/touristy, e.g. the animated video played in the elevator, and you still get really good views from the park at the bottom of the tower. Because of these points, I don't feel like this is a must-do, and I wouldn't recommend it if you have to wait in line."
121,4.0,Namsan or Seoul Tower is 1 of famous landmark in Seoul. We went there day time and nite time. Both are beautiful.
122,5.0,"This is a fun trip starting with the free funicular ride, then cable car to the base of the tower. It is busy but like everything in Korea they are very efficient so even though lines were long we really didn't have to wait for extended period. The views from the tower are outstanding especially if you go just before sunset so you get the day/night aspect, it's a little expensive but I really enjoyed the experience even though I have done similar towers in other countries."
123,4.0,Suggest to go there early if you plan to go there and watch sunset. As there's a long queue waiting in line to go to the top of the tower. Estimate will take about an hour +/- waiting time.
124,4.0,"Thanks to Google Map who thinks we are birds and can fly a bee-line from a bus stop at the bottom of the mountain to the tower in 4 min, we had to take a 30 minute hike ip to the tower. Fortunately, the slope is gentle and the fall foliage along the way more than compensated. The grounds around the tower were adorned with splendid fall colours and the unobstructed view of the city is very enjoyable.  If you would rather not hike up, buses 2,3,5 can take you up from most major sites."
125,5.0,"What a wonderful experience to go up and see how vast the Seoul is, Very very progressive and impressive city! We also enjoyed looking at all the colorful love locks everywhere in the park. There‚Äôs an artisan market, as well as their regular gift shop and they are very inexpensive. It cost approximately $8 Round trip on the cable car but we decided to trek it down. There are little zen gardens in between the stair and it‚Äôs not steep at all. We would recommend to trek it up if you are up to it. Lots of nice photo opps. Just make sure you wear comfy shoes."
126,5.0,I really had no idea how big this city is until I visited the tower.  The views are incredible. The city tour bus is a good way of seeing this along with most other attractions in Seoul.
127,4.0,"Should you wish to burn some calories, refrain from riding a cable car going here. On the other hand, if you are with children and those in their senior years, I suggest you take that round trip cable car. Try to explore the tower, many spots are good for picture taking. They also have 3D and arcade sections."
128,5.0,Great spot to view Seoul. Awesome vistas especially after dark. Great place to close out our How2LeadUS Korean National Security and Leadership Experience
129,4.0,Cool... don't forget to drop by their toilets. They have the most beautiful view. hahaha. will recommend.
130,4.0,A good tourist site. Reasonably priced. Take the cable car to the top and watch the free daily entertainment.
131,4.0,Long wait to get on the cable car but the views from up there are awesome. Some good restaurants too. Had some really tasty udon noodles with beef brisket in one of the restaurants. Well planned attraction and worth the wait.
132,5.0,"Our hotel looked at this tower and we couldn't wait to get up there. We started hiking, but decided to take the cable car up. The wait was long, but not unbearable to get to the top. It was a Saturday afternoon, so that was to be expected. We enjoyed the views and the hiked back down. I would definitely recommend a visit to the N Seoul Tower."
133,3.0,"Very short and not impressive cable car will bring you to a hill, where you will see lots of love locks, several viewpoints and park. Viewpoints are really great overlooking Seoul. To go to tower you have to buy 10000 wons ticket. It includes elevator with a ceiling video ride, restroom with a wall size windows and observation terrace with a glass, which will prevent you from making great pictures. There is a photo service, which will take photo of you and add different backgrounds to it for an additional fee. Bottom of the tower has LG OLED tunnel and Kakao Friends figures. Tower hosts several restaurants including one on the top of it."
134,5.0,"Breathtaking views of Seoul. Take a camera for good pictures. The inclined steps up to the tower were a pain, but worth the 25 minute walk. We paid about 20,000 KRW = $18. If your not in good shape for cement stairs, take the sky trolly over. My only warning is the exit of the tower is kind of scary for a claustrophobic person. Takes too long to exit and the process needs improvement for emergency reasons."
135,4.0,"We took a bus to reach the Tower. We did not go to the top of the tower but there were a few levels from the ground up, that gave us a wonderful view of Seoul and surroundings. We had a bite to eat avail from various outlets. Great atmosphere."
136,5.0,"The trolley car was packed going up and that was a little disconcerting.  However, once at the top the view was spectacular and well worth the trip."
137,3.0,Can not argue that the views from the top are nice. The tower itself is not all that great. Low end souvenirs at the top. You can mail s post card from the tower. Love locks are cute. Not bad but not a must see.
138,4.0,We were hoping to visit for sunset and glad we planned in advance. We rode the gondola up the hill rather than hiking since it was a super hot/humid summer day. There was about a 30-45 minute wait for the gondola ride. Once we got off the gondola we bought our tickets to the top of the tower and stood in line for only 10 minutes. Once at the top we were able to walk around and take plenty of pictures. Also bought a postcard with stamp for about $1USD to write and mail from the top of the tower. After sunset the city lights came on which was another beautiful sight. Then there was another 15 minute line to take the elevator back down to the ground. The area was fun to look at with the trees lit up. The gondola ride down was quite quick with almost no line. This is not a cheap place...I think for 2 adults we spend $50USD between the tower and gondola tickets. I would have planned more time at the base of the tower during the daylight had I known there was more to see because they close parts off after dark.
139,5.0,"This is the best couples ticket in the city.Even the cable car from the street (if you don't want to walk up a lot of stairs) and the gondola ride to the tower are a fun with lots to see. Great place to walk and hold hands when you get to the top. Love locks everywhere, so don't forget yours. Bring your camera for some of the best views and shots in the city. Fun for everyone.Great food and drink at fair price.There was a band rocking out by the base the tower, so atmosphere was very cool.To get the best bang for your buck(or Won) go during the day and leave at night.This will give you the best of both worlds.Enjoy"
140,5.0,N Seoul Tower is the perfect place to orientate yourself in the city and enjoy spectacular city views at the same time. It's a decent walk up the hill if you fancy a workout otherwise there are plenty of buses to take you to the base of the tower. Buy your ticket but don't expect to get admission straight away - this is a popular place and you'll be given a timed ticket. You can select straight forward admission or other packages - we went for one with popcorn and beer! Having to wait I while meant we could explore the lower levels for a bit and appreciate the architecture before we took the lift to the viewing floor. We got there as the sun was setting so could appreciate the city by day and night. The views were impressive. Try get there so you can see the sun set from the top. You won't be dissapointed! If you do leave the tower in the dark you'll need to take the bus back in to town. Finding the right bus was quite a challenge but after a fair wait we found the right one in the end.
141,4.0,"Nice view of the city, takes about 1 hour to get tickets go up take pictures and come back down.  If you are into observation viewing areS want a panoramic view of Seoul then go here."
142,5.0,"There is always a tower sightseeing experience in a big city but this one was better than others I have experienced. With the tower being on top of a hill there are loads of restaurants and bars at the top where you can still enjoy the great view.We loved the bar area at the top as we managed to be at the top for sunset, which I would really recommend seeing.The love lock concept has been done before in other places but the massive amount of them here is actually pretty impressive!"
143,5.0,Absolutely beautiful panoramic views of Seoul from the north Seoul Tower. We went just in time for sunset and saw stunning views
144,5.0,"While weekends can be crowded, we really enjoyed the visit. It was quite windy at the view point so you can carry a jacket if you visit in autumn/ winters, even if it's sunny otherwise. The view was amazing, and I especially remember the video which plays in the lift while you go up or down."
145,4.0,Really close from Myung Dong shopping district (withing walking distance) but yet so far removed from the hustle and bustle of the city.  Beautiful panoramic view of both the old and new Seoul.  Fun place for both couples and families.
146,3.0,"We took the cable car up to the top. The price for adult is 9500 KRW for a round trip - rather expensive taking under consideration that you will spend aprox. 1 minute in the cabin and there will be not much to see from it. Then, we got to the top of Seoul Tower, where you can admire AMAZING views and take some neat pictures. However, its next 10000 KRW for an adult. During your trip to the top, you will be obliged to pose for two photos, fortunately, you dont need to purchase them (15000 KRW each, sick!!). On your way down, you will be also ""distilled"" through a gift shop - as the staff is hoping that you will be also tempted to buy some more overpriced things :PAll in all - the beauty of Seoul is here, expensive, but worth it. However, I cannot say I enjoyed the aggresive money extortion during our visit."
147,5.0,"Travelled up the first night in Seoul, cable car was fun. Views were amazing of Seoul, lots to do while you are there. We went yo the Hello Kitty world, which was fun. Nice coffee shop at the top, with view out over the city. A must to see when in Seoul. Be warned the taxi fare there was very cheap, but will be charged 3 times the amount if you want to get back. We walked down the hill to catch a cab, but thats not for everyone. Great experience."
148,4.0,"Nice view of whole of Korea. Not cheap to go up. Need to pay for cable car ride and entrance fee. But is the best view of Korea, and not to be missed."
149,4.0,"Ok. Seouls tower and viewing deck is not unique at all but on a good day you can see for miles and miles and miles and still not get a grasp of the huge urban sprawl of Seoul today. Worth the money on a clear day. But the whole picture/gift shop thing as everywhere else with these towers, maybe a bit less pushy actually. And the rest room - at least the mens is a hoot!"
150,4.0,"We went there with the cable car which is a very smooth ride to the the top of the hill where the tower is located. We bought round trip tickets, but you can easily go down walking and buy only a one way, this is to go up the hill and the tower is not included.Up in the hill you can take walk and enjoy the view. There many padlocks put there by couples. The visit to the tower costs extra, but you can take only elevator or elevator + 2 beers + a big pop corn, there are 3 different packages.The ride in the elevator is fast and with a small movie on the ceiling. We went during the day, but can imagine that at night must be fantastic.Worth it to visit."
151,5.0,We visited the N Seoul Tower and were amazed by the views of Seoul. A must see during the day with refreshments nearby.
152,5.0,Our personal tour guide bought us to the top of Namsan Seoul Tower.    You can have a 360 degree view of Seoul.
153,5.0,Well the N tower is a small commercial center. It is no so cool BUT the best thing is the point of view at the top of the tower. You can see all Seoul. TAKE THE CABLE WAY to GROW UP.
154,5.0,"The views of the city are quite beautiful. My favorite part were the , ‚Äúlove locks.‚ÄùYou can take a cable car to the base of the tower if you don‚Äôt want to walk."
155,5.0,Visited here with my boyfriend last year. We had amazing views of Seoul although a little cloudy - make sure you go on a clear day.
156,5.0,A great place to view Seoul at night. Lighting is very beautiful and the pricing of the tickets is pretty reasonable as well.A romantic place for couple too
157,4.0,"N Seoul Tower is a nice placeto take photos and see the magnificent view of the surrounding area. We took bus number 2 from Chungmuro station as a family member was not too keen on taking the cable car. Besides the view, there are also a lot of good food options when you get there."
158,4.0,I enjoyed the views from the tower. I especially liked the viewing deck with 360 degree views of Seoul. We did not take the cable car as it was far too hot this time of the year.
159,5.0,"N Seoul Tower is the signature observatory tower of Seoul, sitting on top of Namsan Park. It also houses thematic museums, cafes, restaurants and souvenir shops, so you have plenty of options on what to do.At 10,000 won per entry, N Seoul Tower is one of the cheapest observatories that I have been to. You can mix and match your ticket to have museum entries, food or dining experience to go with it. For a really romantic night, you can make advanced booking (they don't accept walk-ins) for n.Grill, a high class French restaurant. Really enjoyed my experience here. We had a lovely coffee at the cafe on the observatory tower with an equally lovely view. Highly recommend in for an evening outing paired with dinner so you get to see both the day and night view."
160,4.0,"This is a place that I will visit during my every trip to Seoul. My usual time to be at the cable car station by 5pm. It kind of make me slow things down, feeling relax. But for god sake, they should have set a limit for the number of people in each cabin! I mean look, why would people rather pay a little more to get on cable car? For speed? Haha I‚Äôm kidding.. To have a better view and of course some selfies and scenery shoots. But the sad thing that I‚Äôve encountered (almost every visit except once), all I could do was lifting up my hand and blind snapping. Can you imagine that there isn‚Äôt any space for me to just turn around. Kind of feeling sorry for the sardines packed in cans... Well, that‚Äôs the only negative feedback I have. Overall, from the young to the old that‚Äôs a place worth visiting. I leave the place feeling happy, always. Oh, don‚Äôt forget to get a set of lock before the ride. The shops selling at quite a reasonable price. Those locks aren‚Äôt just meant for lovers (K Drama misleads me). Lol!"
161,5.0,"If you want to get to tower by cable car, from the ticket booth, expect a 60 wait to get into the cable car, then once you get up to the tower, you need to purchase another ticket to enter the tower, another 15 minutes wait. The wait was long but was well worth it. Don‚Äôt forget to visit the bridge with all the love locks on it. On the way back, we didn‚Äôt use the cable car because the line was too long, so we hiked down and the view was beautiful as well. So if you plan to use cable car, just one one way ticket if you want to avoid the line to get down."
162,5.0,Classic experience with a thrill of riding the cable car.The landscape is amazing.Clean and comfortable.Friendly staff.Good view.Thank you for great experience and history.
163,4.0,"I recommend to visit the N Seoul Tower at night because the view at night is way more beautiful than the morning view. There is an option of walking or taking the cable train up, so I took the cable train up. there is a bit of wait when we went up and went down after. I would suggest to have a meal in myeongdong area before going up since the pricing at N Seoul Tower would be pricey and limited in selection. Tickets comes in a bundle when purchase at the ticket store, that could range from 2 different visits with N Seoul Tower or N Seoul Tower ticket + a meal at one of the food area there. When you go up, there could be a lot of ppl but don't let the crowd ruin your time because the nightview is simply amazing."
164,3.0,"The Namsan Tower was built in 1972 and is the second highest point in the city at 236 meters. Inside you will find restaurants, food courts and observation decks. It is located in the middle of Namsan park."
165,4.0,"The object of the morning was to hike through Namsan Park and make our way up to N Seoul Tower, we had not need to visit the tower, rather reach the summit and check out the views of Seoul.  There are several ways to reach the tower, hike, cable car or vehicle, from the main road in the vicinity of the cable car is a long staircase and pathway up to the tower, 1200 metres long, there are only a few drinking water fountains along the way and one toilet facilities before reaching the summit. Once we arrived at the tower there were visitors everywhere, school children on excursions, tour bus groups and independent visitors like us, it is a very popular destination in Seoul.  There are other things to see other than the tower, there's a large temple, the Namsan Bongsudae Beacons (five chimneys) and the fabulous views.  There are locks everywhere, designated surfaces for the locks, all over fences, while rather colourful and great to photograph I do not believe in this movement."
166,5.0,Only went initially as the boy wanted to go- we took the cable car up (which was around 7500 each for one way and 9000 return)- you can't buy a combination cable car/tower ticket.  We opted for the beer/popcorn/tower combo which was only 6000 extra (total 26000 for 2) which was amazing value as the beer was delicious and the popcorn was a good size and gave you several flavour choices. We went at sunset and got great views over the city although it's not as tall as most other towers. We took the stairs back down and it took less than half an hour and you had another great view point half way down.  We ended up going back during the day as well and took the stairs up and down which wasn't a taxing climb at all and only took around 40 minutes. We went back to do the love locks (we bought one at the shop where the cable car starts-but you can also buy them at the tower itself).  The locks are very colourful and make for good photo ops as well. It was good to get the views during the day as well-though we didn't go up the tower a second time.
167,5.0,"Really awesome super tall building! Lots of entertainment at the base, and you can pay a bit to go up to the top where there is more entertainment.  Cool depictions of other super tall buildings and cities around the world in the windows."
168,4.0,I walked until the top and it worth it. Nice view and lovely place. I was stopped at the place that there were a million of key love chain or I don't know how to called.
169,4.0,"Namsan tower is renowned as an iconic national landmark and for its cityscape. This place attracts many tourists and even locals especially during night time when the tower lights up. There are many attractions aside from the tower itself; the most famous one is the ""locks of love"" where people- especially couples go to."
170,5.0,"There is an option to take the cable car ride, but we chose to hike (from Myeongdong to Namsam park, then to the tower), and enjoyed the scenery on the way up. We reached the tower at 5pm, and stayed till after sunset (approximately at 7.20pm). The sunset was absolutely stunning! Do plan your trip up strategically so that you can catch the sunset!"
171,3.0,"For me there are too many people. It is somewhat interesting to get on top and to see Seoul from that hight. But there is not much to do up there. After Lotte Tower was built, this Tower became even less attractive. If you are really interested, you can go one time. But it is not in the top 20 things to do in Seoul. To make it interesting, do the trekking from Botanical Garden or Dongguk University up the hill to the Tower. Also crowded on weekends like everything else in Seoul."
172,4.0,"We had planned to go up to this namsan tower park but not sure whether to take the cable car or bus. Understand that there is also a ""travelator"" option too and of course walk up (cycle up too). So finally while walking along myeongdon area, we just walked to the bus stop and took the number 3 shuttle bus (15 minute intervals, 120won per adult) that brought us all the way up to the top. We just needed to walk another 300m from the bus terminus to the peak. The weather was hazy that day so we decided its no point paying to go up to the tower observation deck. The time was 530pm and the weather was cooling down but still bright. We walked about to take photos of the view of Seoul city. There were lots of tourist but the place was quite spacious. There was a section of the base where visitors bought locks and locked it into the fence - I think similar to one of the ""love bridges"" in Paris.There are some shops and several F&B options up there at the base of the tower.We took a bus down again and it brought us back to myeongdon subway station. The ride was comfortable in AC public bus. Not crowded at all. We enjoyed the outing and including the time we spent together on the bus rides. Everything moment made the time memorable."
173,5.0,"The buses are limited from a certain area so you‚Äôre left to walk up a long steep hill. It‚Äôs doable as many people all ages were making the trek. Once at the top, the very was very nice. There are stores and food options without having to go to the top. The tickets to the top were about $8 per adult. The elevator was quick and once to the top they have photo booths, candy, food, souvenirs and great 360 views of Seoul. It was definitely worth it. Then on the way down you can explore each floor and the interesting details that each has."
174,1.0,"Crazy long ques and crowds pushing and shoving, definitely not worth it. Very rushed by staff to get you in and out."
175,4.0,"It may sound boring, but it's always a good idea to take a view from the top of the tower when you are in a new place. Seoul Tower included. Awesome view, especially at night. Also great at daytime. It costs 10,000 won per person to get on the tower.You need to get on the cable car to get up to the NamSan Mountain, or walk. Taxi and private vehicle cannot go up to the mountain for protection of environment reason. You can use either bus or cable car. We used the cable car. Round trip 8,500 won, one way 6,000 won."
176,4.0,"What I didn't like you have to pay separate for the cable car and tower. Not to mention it was very crowded (Thursday). True we did go kinda late, around 21.00. At 21.30 all the restaurants are closed and we really wanted to dine with the view."
177,4.0,"The view from upthere is really amazing. Not to be missed while in Seoul, but it is a quick visit that needs to be inserted in a more comprehensive itinerarium."
178,5.0,"Sunset from the top is breathtaking. After coming in, one can stay in the observatorium for unlimited time - great for the beers + popcorn combo :)"
179,3.0,"We visited the observatory, Hello Kitty land and Ssentoy Museum. It is worth it if you travel there and visit all 3 places in the building. We did not go to the place with locks as the weather was very hot and we weren't interested."
180,4.0,"Its good to see the tower and park,but comparing to other towers ,i think its not very special.there are souvenir shops, city view cameras, some love realted decorations and designs for taking photos....etc.the ticket can be bought at the entrance."
181,5.0,"The tower was beautiful. Starting off its not hard to get too. If you want to take the cable car then you'll get off at Myeong-dong station and walk about 15 minutes towards the Pacific Hotel to the right. The only thing about the cable car is 1. There are very few cable cars so you won't get your own car but you'll be on it with about 15/20 other people.2. The wait time depending on the time of day you go can take up to 30 minutes to an hour. THIS IS JUST ONE WAY btw!3. Be prepared to spend more time waiting in line for the cable car if you decide to do round trip.Another way you can go up is by bus which is very efficient. Buses 2,4 and 5 will take you there and from there you can walk up the hill or ramp. Once you get up you'll see the love locks (which you can lock your lock) in numerous spots around the tower. You'll also enjoy the beautiful scenery. I enjoyed the night view for I loved how lighted the city was and how quiet it was to just enjoy the lights, breeze and view. I also heard that going during the day was just as nice.  You don't need to go to the observatory deck to see the 360 view of the city for your able to see it below but if you want to do something extra then you can pay to do it and easily pick up your tickets. It's also best to book your tickets in advance for the observatory deck.Overall I would recommend."
182,4.0,Worth the trip to the top. There is a funicular to the cable car station which we took ages to find >_< but it was worth looking for it. The views in the cable car are alright but nothing compared to when you get up the tower. There is also a HK Island (museum type of Hello Kitty) and a toy museum. We bought the ticket that lets us into all three while we were there. You can skip this if you don't have interest in these things but I'm a child at heart so I loved it.
183,4.0,Went there before sunset and it was lovely. The tower itself not high only 5th floor bit since it was up high on the hill so the view is 360 ard seoul. Lovely area ard the tower. The tower itself is not big and gets crowded during peak time. Got a lots of school kids doing field trip when we were up there so going down took us 45 mins queque time üò¢
184,4.0,"What an overwhelming sight. Below the famous Namsan Seoul Tower is a huge collection of locks hang on a long wall to symbolise endless love between not only lover but also within families. Also other wishes such as friends to meet up in 10 years time. With new locks adding daily, it is very difficult to find a spot on the original fence. Some hanging from another lock. Not only padlocks , we saw slippers and socks hanging too. Don't forget to sit on a heart chair - looks broken with a bend in the middle.Great view of the city from the Terrace. Padlocks selling at the premises are very pricey, suggest to get in advance from outside."
185,4.0,We went there during the day. The view is nice and ok but I flew to Seoul after Tokyo and was much less impressed by the Seoul view (vs Tokyo Sky Tree night view). Maybe at night it would be better. The air around that area was very good and you can have nice walk around for an hour.
186,4.0,"Nice view of the city, but not worth queuing and paying to go to the top. Tickets aren't expensive but the view in the tower is the same as what you get outside and there isn't anything much or special in the tower + insanely long queues. Take a bus up because its a steep walk up. One of the locals actually told us we can WALK from Myeongdong. Glad we didn't."
187,5.0,"It is worth a trip up the tower if it is not too crowded and the queue is long. The city scene up there is nice at night. Actually taking pictures of the city from the park below without the glass window is much better and clearer. But as a tourist, heading up to the tower is just some novelty."
188,5.0,"Lucked out with no crowds or lines! Cable car up to the base gardens; quite a few stairs, lots of rock walls and stunning views make this outing one of the favourites of Seoul. Scoring a reasonable clear day, views were amazing, the gardens spectacular and the walkways well worth the time. Souvenirs, food, drinks and lots to do. Sit and enjoy the cool air or wander around the lush forested area - very much a spectacular spot."
189,4.0,"cant really say much about the tower, i mean its a high place. if you want to enjoy more? get a package with ssentoy or hello kitty island depending on your preference no lines, though"
190,4.0,"This place is cool! It has a led tv tunnel, bridge of love where you can post locks and several snack stores. I have not tried going up the observatory as an afraid of heights!"
191,5.0,"Obviously, you go here for the panoramic view. If at all possible, choose a clear day and you can see for miles. Come with your sweetheart and place a lock on the tunnel of love or one of the many sculptures provided to do so. Note: if you buy a souvenir picture, they give you a free digital download, which is a nice touch. Secondary note: even if you take the bus instead of hiking up, there is a pretty steep road to get to the tower. Be prepared."
192,5.0,Stunning visit the price its OK to go up but the view is really worthy by night and sunset!!! We love it! Romantic spot!
193,5.0,"We decided to go during the day - and this meant beating the queues! We had no waiting time at the ticket office, and we went straight up and enjoyed the view. It is lovely to be able to see the whole city laid out before you and be able to distinguish its different areas. I am sure the night view is great as well, but I can definitely recommend a day trip.I would suggest getting the cable car up and walking down, because although not steep it is a long, slow rise to get to the tower. If you're like us - enjoy walking but maybe not in the best shape! - then your legs are sure to be achy. And the cable car ride does offer a lovely view that's worth paying for. Inside the tower, you can pick up souvenirs (possibly slightly overpriced), eat at restaurants (quite dear), or perhaps enjoy a drink at the Twosome cafe. We had beer and cake there, and enjoyed the view for a surprisingly reasonable price.One thing to look out for are performances at the bottom of the tower. There's quite a large square with viewpoints alongside it. When we arrived, some sword-fight demonstration was going on. Worth staying behind a few minutes for if it's happening."
194,4.0,Go earlier or you will have to queue for at least one hours after 6pm. Most ppl take cable car in the evening to be able to see the sunset. Food is costly up there.
195,4.0,"We did our usual hop-on-hop off bus on our first day visiting a new city. Seoul Tower was one of the first stops. Excellent way to take a birds-eye view over the city and surrounds. We were lucky to have a clear sunny day, we learned that it can get fairly smoggy and/or cloudy in Seoul. Our hotel was at the base of the Namsan hill in Myeongdong so the tower became a good 'home' landmark when wandering and becoming lost in the enourmous city. I am pleased we visited Seoul Tower on the first day of our visit to Seoul."
196,4.0,"Went up at Observatory deck of N Seoul Tower for curiosity. Went up there not to see the view of Seoul city, but to see the sky high bathroom and to dine in at one of the restaurants. That was it."
197,5.0,"I fell in love with Korea the first time I visited it and I knew I had to come back. One of their popular tourist destinations is N Seoul Tower. My husband and I hung our love lock by the tower and wrote it with our names on it. It felt great! It's also a good idea for friendship, not just for couples. Locks may be bought from the store near the tower."
198,5.0,Beautiful views and lots to see! Hello Kitty was my favorite part. It was a little expensive but overall an unforgettable experience.
199,4.0,"I went there a few weeks ago with my boyfriend and I have to admit the view is quite extraordinary! I really enjoyed the different activities too, even if I didn't feel like paying extra for some (like the Teddy Bear Museum). I think it is a bit disappointing that Seoul is most of the time foggy, so the view can get a bit limited on some days but I was lucky with my visit. Definitely a must, especially for couples!"
200,4.0,"If the sky is clear the view is nice; even better at night. The tower is not very tall so it is, similar to anyother city; it is however very simbolic from seoul, there is like a small mall at the bottom of the tower and s¬°sometimes cultural performances too."
201,4.0,"Lots of stairs and great hike up.  We took the bus down. Evening is great, we had good pictures of the tower and the city.  We didnt go up the elevator.  There is a free 3D picture show the reruns about every 10 min.  It was nice."
202,5.0,We went there on our anniversary and totally enjoyed the evening.There is souvenir shop too which is pricy.Italian cuisine restaurant serves great food.
203,4.0,"This tower is worth checking out when you are in Seoul. However, the Korea buffet restaurant at the top level is over-priced and lack of varieties, not recommended. There are other restaurants in the vicinity which I think worth exploring."
204,5.0,"The view from the N Seoul Tower is fantastic. You can see all off Seoul in  every direction. Take a walk around the park for a pleasant walk (leftbound) around the park, starting from the Namsangol Hanok Village. Then it is a 3,5 km nice walk in the park with a not too steep walk. Or you can go up alongside the cable car which gives to a mot of steps."
205,5.0,"N Seoul Tower is worth the visit. Although we didn't climb to the top of the tower, we spent time watching the sunset just outside of it. The views of the city from the park around the tower are well worth the visit. I would recommend taking a bus to the top. Walking up to the top is doable, although tiring, but the views on the climb up (or down) are well worth the trek."
206,4.0,"Had to wait about 15 mins to take a short elevator up to the cable car center. Another 15 mins queue to get return tickets (8500 won per adult). Then it was almost an hours queue to get into the cable car to get to the towerThe crazy waiting aside, it was a magnificent view of the surrounding town. There is also decent F&B and shops here too. We didn't go up to the observatory or the musuems though.Another thing note worthy to visit is the lovers Bridge. Apparently couples buy locks (now they don't do metal locks anymore due to environment reasons), write their names on it and lock it on the bridge and surrounding areas as a symbol of locking ur love away.To the wife this was a romantic gesture but to me it was a waste of resources and creation of trash. To each his own then.üòÅ"
207,3.0,It was a short cable car ride to reach N Seoul Tower and you need to pay 26000 won with pop-corn and 2 soft drinks for 2 to reach to the top of the tower to see the whole city of Seoul. Remember to buy love lock to lock your love along the fence or others place that you can find. A must go to the toilet and you be amazes to see the city when peeing. It's actually take less than 30 mins for the whole sightseeing beside the Q-ing for the cable car & the lift to go up the tower..
208,5.0,"I heard about the hike and the cable car, but since this was one of the stops on our bus tour, we did it then. The bus goes almost to the top, only a short walk to reach the tower from there. View is amazing! We were lucky with the weather; it was blue sky and very clear, so took some great shots. We didn't go up, as we felt the view from down there was good enough. Nice walk around, nice food options and plenty of other things to do. Must to!!"
209,3.0,"The cable car is cool, but you have to pay extra to go the rest of the way into the tower. Lines are pretty long, but the view is worth the effort.The best thing to do would be to take the cable car up, then walk down along the old city wall. It's nice at night.Buy a love lock and join in on the fun."
210,5.0,"A very popular place . A visit to the restaurants require planning as the reservations fill up very quickly on weekends . The entire environment / view from the beginning with the cable car to the seat setup in ' The Place Dining ' which maximizes the view is a must do for a great romantic evening out with that special person . The Italian cuisine is good , however there is a limited  of alcoholic beverages ."
211,4.0,North Seoul Tower is pretty much a must see when you are in town . Like the CN Toer in Toronto or the Space Needle in Seattle. You just pretty much have to do it. Great view! We went in the early evening and saw things in daylight and night light. One thing that we didn‚Äôt realize was that it‚Äôs kind of a romantic place fire couples to go and place a lock with their name on it on the fence. Locks are available to purchase there or bring your own. Food is available there. Anything from grap and go good to sit down resturant. Take the cable car to the base of the tower
212,4.0,Really nice experience to climb up to the surrounding of the Seoul Tower and take the cable car up to the actual tower.Lots of little activities for children with Pokemon characters and areas to take pictures and enjoy the beautiful views of the city.I would really recommend the experience. If you are traveling with your partner try and get the lock in the actual city as they are extremely overpriced up in the tower.
213,5.0,"Namsan Tower is really perfect place for seeing Seoul from top.(if the weather is clear daily time) You can reach here by Bus, cable car or on foot. One of the the best choice is cable car!(operating hour: 10:00-23:00 - Fare: Round-trip (Adults 8,500 won / Children 5,500 won) / One-way (Adults 6,000 won / Children 3,500 won, it can be changeable year by year) There are lots of coffee shops, souvenir shops or restaurants. There is fun museum you can take pictures a lot inside! Don't miss it!By the way you can eat something inside tower but little expensive and not tasty for me. You have to catch traditional performance also. (15.00 everyday) Ah by the way padlocks are everywhere :) so hang some of them and write your love story:)"
214,4.0,"We walked from Namsan park to the N tower and take the cable car down. We enjoy the walk cause the view on the way up is very nice, we stopped many times to take photos. Strongly recommend people to go there! Very chill!"
215,4.0,We rode the cable car going up. Took the bus on our way down. Makes more sense than taking the crowded cable car. Long queues to ride the cable car. Love locks are good for couples. Namsan tower gives you a perfect view of the city. Got free passes from Shinsegae Duty Free.
216,4.0,"Every city has its iconic tower, and this is Seoul's. The panoramic views here, even from the parks, are simply beautiful, especially during sundown. The breeze is lovely too. It can get quite chilly at times, basically in all seasons but summer. Probably the most famous thing here is the love locks, where couples can buy locks and write messages on them to lock them in dedicated sections. It's quite pretty with all the different coloured locks. There's a cable car ride as well which could be worth the trip, even though I did not personally experience it."
217,4.0,"For 10,000 per adult you get to visit the observatory deck of the tower. Not a bad price compared to other cities.  Get there early for a quieter viewing experience.  We had no wait for the elevators, which was great.   Great views from the top.  Amazing on a clear day."
218,5.0,"Lots of nice views and popcorn.I like popcorn, especially with cheese. Maybe potatoes too. Shall we go eat swirl potato tomorrow?"
219,3.0,"There is only one reason to go to the Nansam Seoul Tower - to get a grand view of Seoul.  It is worth going up just for that reason.  The 360-degree restaurant view is also spectacular, especially at night. Just don't expect the food to be more than average, and don't be shocked by the high prices - just remember, you are there for the view.  If you are there for anything else, you will be disappointed.  NOTE:  Don't go up when the air quality is bad - you won't see much."
220,4.0,"My husband and I took the shuttle bus from Chungmuro Station to go up to Seoul Tower. It was a cheap and convenient mode of transport. You can also walk up through Namsan Park or take the cable car up. Once you reach the Observatory Deck, the views are already fantastic  on a clear day.  However,  you got to go up for the magnificent views of Seoul City.  We had lunch at the Korean fusion  restaurant on the ground floor. It was delicious and reasonably priced.  Highly recommended to visit while in Seoul."
221,4.0,Good place to visit for relaxing and great city view. Color of tower lighting changes based on air quality. love locks are great.
222,3.0,"In March, you barely see anything due to thick fog. But I cannot imagine this place will look any different in another season though..Located on a hill near Seoul, you supposedly able to see the sparkling Seoul at night.They have a couple of stores and museum inside the tower area, but it was just standard. This place could be a better tourist destination if they involve more imagination in developing this area."
223,5.0,This is one of the best places I've visited during my trip in Korea. The place has a full view of the City. THis is also the place where couples place in their love locks to seal their love as they say. Nice picturesque place. Every view is worth taking pictures. Must see in Seoul..
224,5.0,"It was abit hazy when we get there but we still managed to enjoy our time in the tower. Initially we tried to walk, but we gave up and ride the cable car instead. It wasn‚Äôt an easy journey I would say. There are love locks garden where you can place a padlock all around the tower."
225,4.0,"From Myeongdong station, take the bus #5 straight to the tower, with only 1200W. If you don't know how to get the bus, there are mobile tourist info providers wearing red jackets at the main tourist attractions to help you out. They are indeed very helpful. Upon arriving at the tower, you may need to climb a steep path about 150m to the main entrance. I see many people just lingering around the open space where lovers placed their love locks along the fences. It's very sweet and good for photo sessions. They sell locks from a vendor machine but it costs 9000 W. Wow! Why don't we just enjoy the view of Seoul merely. Hehe."
226,4.0,"I sincerely recommend to climb to N Seoul tower or to take the cable car in a good, clean weather. A view is sooooo amazing! You can actually see almost all Seoul! You can also buy many souvenirs and get nice pics. Really popular for love locks. They are almost everywhere"
227,5.0,"The tower is really in an amazing location the views were great and we were fortunate to go on a clear day.  There was also a show in the ""court yard"" of music which was neat.  We enjoyed the exercise and all of the love lockets!"
228,4.0,This atraction is worth to see the wonderful views of seoul the tower has love locks all around the railings with lots of people leaving love messages
229,5.0,"Took a cable car in the evening, quite nice (apart from the chill).One of the must visit place when visiting Korea."
230,4.0,We went up the tower after our dinner at foothills and was enjoying the walk up the hills. You can also take a cable car to the tower if you don't fancy flight of stairs. There are cafe if you want to sit and enjoy the view while finishing a drink & popcorn.
231,4.0,the lift does not bring us directly to the ticket office..we use stairs and it was quite slippery as it was raining on that night.we went late so most of the shops are already closed.one must really know where to board the buses 02 03 and 05 to go to the top.We saw snow the first time.the view was spectacular but as the he8ght restriction it was not that great compared to taipei 101 or tokyo tower.Combo ticket consists of observatory hello kitty museum and SSentoy museum which i think quite worth.
232,3.0,"We loved the walk up to the tower and the love locks and the green tea lattes, but each time we needed to get in a lift we had to queue for what seemed way longer than necessary! Otherwise defs worth a visit."
233,3.0,"If the tower itself is not the most impressive in the world, it is still worth it. Take the cable car up the hill and enjoy the great views of Seoul at sunset. See the city walls light up all around Seoul in the mountains opposite the tower and the sun reflection in the river towards south. It takes 45 minutes to walk down and can be a good to open your appetite before hitting a great Korean restaurant"
234,4.0,"Very busy....of course we knew it would be after the 40 minute wait for the cable car.  Huge complex and great views - disappointingly the viewing windows were pretty grubby and not at all condusive to achieving good photos.  I was quite surprised by this as Seoul was a very clean city and I would have expected there to be a team of people constantly cleaning them.Other than the views the tower was very commercial with restaurants and shops. A must do, I think we spent a couple of hours here and did have difficulty finding our way back to the cable car departure point!"
235,5.0,"Suits family outing, couple dating. Take the cable car up before sunset and great views awaiting you. Take the public bus when you leave and admirer the night view along the route down.."
236,5.0,"At first the walk up the hill was a bit tiring until you took the first ride up . Then you get in line to buy the tickets which I‚Äôm guessing with no holiday will be less persons , don‚Äôt worry it will be quick , then you go upstairs to stand in line again to get on the tramp which will take another couple 15-20 mins depends on the time of visit . But on arrival to the top , it‚Äôll be worth the wait . The view , the restaurants , the activities ."
237,5.0,"Great views obviously. Got a slightly tacky but funny professional photo taken, very nice. Bought a souvenir up top from the sweetest girl ever, awesome view of the city. Must do."
238,5.0,Took the bus from the city to the tower and managed to catch the sunset. It was beautiful esp for photo taking near the locks and keys deck. There're multiple bus number which can bring you back to the main city esp if you stay at Myeongdong. Just look at the bored for the location that you're going and wait for 10-15 mins for the bus. The interval is very fast. Very convenient to go there by public. Mini shopping centre below the deck where to can eat or buy drinks like bubble tea but don't expect much from it as the main attraction is still the observation deck. There's also an arcade. Place was very peaceful. Still can oversee the whole of seoul from the shopping area as you can go out and take pictures at a higher level
239,5.0,"On the way there's always something to stop by for exemple the ""the locker"" where you can lock your love with someone special. Once you're at the top, you'll get the view of the entire Seoul ( most beautiful at night). The  Seoul Tower also provides you a lot of other activities such as game station and photobooth. Personally I think the ticket is very expensive but it'll worth the ecperience. So very recommend!"
240,5.0,you must take the ride up to Seoul Tower preferably at night so you can look at the lights of the city
241,3.0,Good view and the price is pretty good. I‚Äôd recommend walking up instead of the tour bus unless you are pressed for time the views are fantastic all the way and it‚Äôs a pleasant walk and relatively easy.
242,4.0,The view from the tower was great. It really puts the size of Seoul in perspective.  $10/person for the elevator ride up. A must for first timers to see how huge the city is.
243,4.0,"The Seoul Tower situates at the town centre just 10 minutes walk from No. 4 exit of Myeong Dong Metro Station of Route 4. Small and large cable cars are disabled friendly. Although not very high, you enjoy a nice panaramic view of Seoul on the obervation deck of the tower. By the way the toilet is quite unique with a nice view of Seoul while using it.Probably worth to pay a short visit during the stay in Seoul."
244,5.0,"Korean Experience is not complete if you never get to visit N Seoul Tower.It is one of the highlights of our tour that I enjoyed a lot.Being a self confessed nature lover,I really enjoyed it on our way  to the peak of the mountain with all the zigzags and snowy trees. Bus was our means of transpo going up. Buses to NSeoul Tower  is accessible from anywhere in Seoul.Also, going back to Myeongdong or any area in Korea is convenient as buses are available as scheduled.With respect to natural lighting,best time to go there is from 4 pm to 7pm thus giving a nice effects on your pictures.We'd got so many nice pictures,awesome. You have to go there before dark time to enjoy the view much better.The view from atop is a picturesque. It was snowing that time. One experience definitely worth remembering."
245,5.0,"We visited N Seoul Tower, which is touted to be among the highest buildings in South Korea.  It is comparable to The Peak in Hong Kong.  It was fun.  And they also have other attractions in the building such as The Hello Kitty World, and Ssentoy Toy Museum and Shop."
246,4.0,"Everything here is a bit pricy however, it is a great sightseeing or dating venue. We roamed around the complex looking at the love locks, super hero museum, coffee shop and gift store. We then ventured to the observatory where it had a nice view of the city, photo booth and another gift shop. We ended the night with a romantic dinner in the revolving restaurant. It costs atleast 130K wons per person to eat here( you are really paying for the experience)."
247,4.0,Worth a visit when your in Seoul. Not too expensive and our ticket included a drink and some popcorn which was nice to sit and enjoy while watching the sun set over Seoul.
248,4.0,"Just stopped and took pictures did not climb, was on Hop on and Hop off bus.  Toocold to stand around in January"
249,3.0,Worth a visit for the views but not much else up there and all a bit of a mess.  Walking up is very steep so be aware.
250,5.0,"I took my wife here for our 26th anniversary and we left a Love Lock on the fence.  Very fun, great views and something everybody should experience."
251,4.0,"Visited N Seoul Tower on a Thursday afternoon around 2PM. There weren't any crazy lines for either the cable car up to the tower or the observatory. I suggest to purchase observatory tickets in advance to make the process a bit faster (you can't skip the lines; you still have to line up at the ticket booth to exchange your voucher for a ticket, but at least it's already paid for!). The sunlight at 2PM made it hard to take pictures, as the glare didn't agree with my camera. Perhaps try going in the morning or around/after sunset."
252,5.0,"I say great view of Seoul IF the weather or smog is clear.  Otherwise, it will be like going up into any observation tower and seeing next to nothing.  With clear weather, you can see Seoul better than any place else.  Lots of food places at the base.  If you have a significant other, bring a padlock, write your lovebirds name on it, and fasten it with the millions of other adorning the fences around the base area of N Seoul Tower.  You can take a moderate hike up from multiple directions, take a tram ride from Namdaemum area, or catch some public transportation (or tour).  Dominant landmark visible from all over the city for getting your bearing.  Interesting place to visit."
253,5.0,I saw Namsan Tower on many kdrama and it is as beautiful and romantic as what I see on the drama. Go before it turn dark and then wait for nightfall. The city below would be tinkling.
254,5.0,"If you are looking for a great view of Seoul, please visit the N Seoul Tower. It is a nice ride up (if you take the Cable Car) or a nice walk if you have the condition. From the top, you get to see the entire city.Also, there are some ‚Äúlove‚Äù fences in which people can express their love with a lock.Nice to visit, don‚Äôt miss it if you are in Seoul."
255,1.0,"We were here nearing sunset. The view of Seoul from Namsan Park was great but not the view from the observatory deck which cost 10k won. We felt that the glass was stained and could not provide a clear view. Especially at night, the glass was reflected by the bright light from inside the deck. Ended up, we could not see much of the view and have to constantly get ourselves as near as to the glass and kept wiping the condensed glass. We also felt that the deck was more like a souvenir shop as it was very packed and the walkway was narrow. Other than that, the line was long too. So there were waiting, lining, waiting and lining. Pretty standard for touristy spot.Would recommend to just view the skyline at Namsan Park instead. The sunset was good too."
256,5.0,"We took a bus to the tower.  There was a walk up a steep hill and at the top to the right is the center point of Seoul marker.  The tower elevator incorporated an ""in-flight movie"" on the ceiling.  At the bottom of the tower you can buy a love padlock and lock it around the fence."
257,5.0,"At 237metres tall tower, this is a great place for photographs, even in their toilets! However do be mentally prepared as the place is slightly crowded."
258,4.0,"Note the cable car tickets are separate to the Tower entrance ticket. We arrived via the cable car and the station opens up to the viewing platform with commitment locks. Locks were available to be purchased as well as flowers from vending machines. There was a cafe here to wait for the cable car if the queue is long.Otherwise it was a short walk from the cable car station to the base of the tower. Tickets to enter the tower are located outside of the tower. For two people, we got the combination ticket with soft drinks and a bucket of popcorn free. There were several shops and cafes/restaurants at the base and in the tower. As we  visited in the morning, there was virtually no queue for the elevator up to the observation level. Great views on a clear autumn day. There are very limited ""seating"" on the observation deck, so don't plan to stay too long.Don't forget to use the washroom!"
259,4.0,"Though it's not completely straight forward to get to, the Namsan Tower is the perfect spot to take in a great view of Seoul. Grabbing the bus to the cable car is probably your best option, after which you can ride it to the tower itself. When you're at the tower, you not only get a 360 degrees view of Seoul but there's also restaurants, snacks, and gift shops. Don't forget to check out the lovelocks! Keep in mind the cable cars don't run when it's windy, so best to go on a clear day and it's generally best to go at night for the view of all the lights when it's not raining!"
260,4.0,The Tower could be reached both by cable car and on feet. The view is very from the tower. Couples often place a love locker there.
261,4.0,Price is Ok. Good view of the city. Pay a little extra for drinks and a popcorn.  That tub is huge. Would be five stars if it were easier to access. You either need to take tram or walk up.
262,5.0,"We went at night, which was a different view of the city.  All of the lights are beautiful and the gondola to the tower is really pretty views."
263,4.0,"We went here via cable car (KRW 8,000 per person, roundtrip). It was around 9pm on a Saturday, so the line going inside the cable car bound for the N Seoul Tower wasn't long.. however. the one bound for the exit of the tower was full of people!We had paid a ticket for the observatory thru Klook, and it turned out to be cheaper, as the one they were selling on the spot was KRW 10,000 per person (I got mine on Klook for 298 PHP per person~).Buy a padlock and marker in advance if you're planning to leave a padlock in N Seoul Tower because the ones they have there are pretty overpriced.Overall, it was a good experience. We got to see Seoul from the observatory and it was quite romantic!"
264,5.0,"Do note that you need to pay twice to enter this tower, one for the cable car and one for the actual tower entrance fees. You could also take a bus up I believe but most individual tourists would take the cable car. We visited on a day where visibility was quite poor so that was unfortunate, but still wanted to make a stop here as we have heard of it in many Korean dramas :) The love lock area was great as well, super colorful. You can bring your own locks or purchase an overpriced (but colorful) one at the gift shop"
265,5.0,"Beautiful Views from one of the tallest structures in Seoul.  While I was there, we got a combo popcorn and beer from downstairs and watched snow flurries from the observation deck."
266,5.0,"We went on the clear morning at 10 am, so we did not have a line. Make sure to buy a lock there if you are that type of things - we did. No line and it was nice. Not the best tower, but gives you a good perspective on the city. We also took a walk down from the tower - very nice and easy walk."
267,5.0,you can buy a lock with your lover and lock on the wall. the lock can buy from the shop at N seoul tower.
268,4.0,The N Seoul Tower is the highest spot in Seoul enabling 360 view of the city. It is located on a forested hill to which a nice cable car is leading. At its base a love couples area resides where you'll find thousands of locks locked on every fence and special tree to denote a couple's love. It's a nice attraction to visit if you have some spare time.
269,4.0,"We had heard that it gets very busy at night, so we made sure we got up to the first platform before the sun set. We had time to look around before having dinner in one of the restuarants, which was very reasonably priced. The view from the top was average, unfortunately there was a lot of light inside the building that prevented a clear view of the sky. There was a good view from the toilets though."
270,5.0,"Built in 1969 this is an excellent tower on top of a hill providing maximum views. Highlights apart from the views are looking a everyone's love lockets affixed just outside at the base. You can buy food and drink cheaply at the base and at the top. Entrance 10,000 KRW. Allow 1 to 2 hours."
271,4.0,Took the cable car to the tower.  Great place for photo taking. Restaurants and shopping at the tower.
272,5.0,A must if you‚Äôre in Seoul! From the tower you get a stunning view of the city and its surroundings. Also a very nice souvenir shop at the top.
273,5.0,"Visited the N Seoul tower a few times whilst visiting Korea, truly remarkable sites when you to get to the top from day through to night. You can either take a nice walk up from through namsan or you can take the cable car which was quite cheap! Oh and great restaurants at the top too!"
274,5.0,"If you want an amazing view without having to climb a mountain this is the spot for you! The view was do good we went back twice during our stay.There's loads of food options, noodles, burgers, cultets, chicken and beer, 2 buffets and a French restaurant on the top floor. There's also a pretty good arcade and there are martial arts displays on sometimes, the cable car makes it so easy to access but the walk up through the park is lovely too. Not to be missed."
275,4.0,N Seoul Tower itself was just okay. It's a closed space so the view was not really spectacular.The place itself was a very good place to visit. There's a Hanbok Experience store in the area which we really loved. They have premium Hanboks for rent and various settings for picture taking. The prices here are way higher than those found near the palaces but the same goes for the quality.
276,5.0,"Walked up, gondola down.  Worth the trek.  Incredible views that really highlight the overall expanse of the city of Seoul."
277,5.0,"One of the touristy things that everyone should do. Take the cable car up near Myeongdong station, and you will get an amazing view of Seoul. Recommend going at night for beautiful nighttime viewing."
278,3.0,"After seeing the towers in Shanghai and Kuala Lumpur, the view is nice but underwelming. The tower is additionally not that high and the viewing deck is not that big. However, I do recommend visiting the toilets (as they also have the same nice view) and a bucket of caramel popcorn as you wait to go upstairs."
279,5.0,"You need to get to Namsan Park before purchasing a ticket (about AUD10) to the tower, you can either choose to hike up or get in a cable car. Once arrived, you need to purchase ticket to get up yo to the tower. Expect big crowd if go after 11am as this is a popular tourist spot for groups."
280,3.0,"Whenever you go to viewing spots it is short.  You see the sight, you're done.  We waited about 15 minutes for the elevator.  We probably spent less time than that up top.  We saw what we could see at night, took photos, then left.  There were sooo many kids - maybe a class?"
281,5.0,"A must see for tourists - I go every year when I‚Äôm in the country and although the view is the same, it still takes my breath away.The nighttime view is so breathtaking and makes great photo opportunities."
282,5.0,We spent a lovely evening at the seoul tower area... firstly the cable car. From here you can get great views over the city alone. Bring a camera and tripod. Secondly head to a shop and buy a padlock. You will see where to put it. We then went up the tower and took in the great views of seoul. Afterwards we ate dinner at the buffet restaurant at the bottom of the tower. Highly reccomended
283,5.0,We took cable car to N Seoul Tower. Love their beautiful scenery. They have locks trees which you can buy those cute locks from their souvenir shops and write both partner's name & lock it there.
284,4.0,Great place for travelers kkk. and weather was cool and really good place for couples i think kk if ure traveler hace to go there but evening is more beautiful and have fun
285,5.0,"Suggested time to go up by around 4pm. then go straight on the love lock area and witness the sunset. After the sunset you can go to the park beside the tower and theres a show you can watch... its ideal to go up the tower by around 7pm so you can see the beautiful lights of seoul. Dont forget to buy pop corn and drinks on the ground level (before riding the elevator to tower) its much enjoyable you see the view while eating and chatting with friends. once you are at the top of the tower, dont worry theres a lot of space you can sit on :) Enjoy!!!"
286,3.0,"My wife and I were visiting Seoul for five days and towards the end of our stay, we were largely out of sightseeing destinations.  Almost as an afterthought, we decided to see the view at night from N Tower.  I genuinely wish we hadn't made that decision.  The process takes a long time as it is crowded getting up the cable car and then up the elevator.  Then the view from the top is (at least at night) largely obscured by the bright lights of the gift shop displays which are DIRECTLY behind all the windows.  So you're essentially seeing glare, not the beautiful city lights.  Big tourist trap too - lots of kitschy souvenirs and overpriced food.  To say nothing of the ""love lock"" gimmick they have going on too.  And the N Tower itself is hardly impressive if you're been to other towers around the world.Pass on this one."
287,5.0,"Walking through Namsen park up to the tower was our favorite part of Seoul. Beautiful views, and when you leave down the cable car it is not more than half a mile to Meongdong area."
288,5.0,"We paid and took the cable car up and walked around for a bit when we arrived. It was nice in the area without needing to go further up in the N Seoul Tower. Having said that, we paid 21,000krw (about $21 USD) for the two of us to go up the tower, with two drinks and a large popcorn. Or you can go up the tower for 10,000krw each. When we went up, it was just in time for the sunset, and that's when you truly can see how large Seoul really is!"
289,4.0,We walked up instead of taking the tram. Fine in 24 degrees Celsius but we are quite fit and were happy for some cardio. Lovely once you are up there. Cute shops and an arcade too
290,5.0,"The walk in Autumn is definitely worth it instead of getting the cable car.The base of the tower had traditional dancing and performances which is great to stop and watch whole you rest a little.The line for the tower was fairly long but the views are amazing from the top.  The most surprising thing was going to the toilet to discover the full window views, definitely an experience in itself lol."
291,4.0,"N Seoul Tower is worth to visit.  1st time been there by cable car.  2nd time I went there last year during my honeymoon trip.  since the cable car is under maintenance, we go up there by public bus.  Feel so happy go round around the city before we reach our destination.  I would say the scenery is beautiful from the top. you can see the whole Seoul City.. In the cold weather, its so relaxing. The padlock is an attraction...I cannot help it but to read the wordings on the padlock....Its really funny you know...People write a lot of things to express their love affair. Ha ha ha. I really like to spend time up there."
292,5.0,"We couldn't take the  cable car due to the long queue. We decided to walk till the top and the stress was well paid back. The view was amazing, especially at night. A must attraction if u spend some.some . days in seoul"
293,4.0,We made two trips up to the tower - one during the day mid week and we were pleasantly surprised that we didn't have to queue very long for either the cable car or the lift to the top. But when we returned with our daughter to do a night time trip on a Saturday it was another story and we had a long wait for the cable car of about hour and twenty and then there was going to be another hour for the lift to the top. You get a good view from half way so we didn't bother queuing. It was very busy and we didn't bother eating up there either  a good trip though and worth making .
294,5.0,So this is a touristy spot but well worth the time to visit just for the amazing views of the city. Saw this as part of a tour but would go to see it on its own.
