0,5.0,"Enjoyed the trip to Seoul Tower via cable car. Likely queueing for cable car but moves well and will let you know queueing time when purchasing ticket. Lovely views of the city, clear blue sky’s. If traveling with partner bring a lock!"
1,2.0,"Pay 7$ just to be pressed inside the cabin with lots of people after a big line to enter. You can hardly move, forget about taking photos. My advice is to take a bus (see on naver map: 02, 03, 05) to get there, they're going from all main places nearby, it's cheaper and even more comfortable."
2,3.0,"The cable-car is convenient, and not particularly expensive, however not worth a visit in itself, and if steps or time are not a problem (of if the line is long), I would recommend just taking the stairs up to the N-Tower at the top of the hill, which makes for a very nice stroll."
3,4.0,"I was gallivanting about all over Seoul one day recently and decided that as it was so sunny and clear then I should take a look at the city from a high point - the North Seoul Tower, for example. I got close and realised that it could be quite a climb to the top of the Namsan hill on which the Tower is perched. Then I spied the signs to the cable car so decided to take the lazy option and headed over to the entrance. For the princely sum of 9.500 Won an adult can purchase a return ticket on this contraption which can, apparently transport 50 (small) people. Actually the ride is over quite quickly - I guess around 5 minutes and it's not the optimal place to enjoy the views. But I was grateful to avoid an arduous climb. Only later I discovered that you can also take a bus to the Tower which I guess is considerably more economic. Oh, well..."
4,4.0,"Roundtrip ticket costs 8500 Won.  I walked from my hotel in Myeongdong to the Namsan Cable Car station.  It was a bit of a walk uphill since the Namsan Outdoor Escalator wasn’t working.  There was no air conditioning in the cable car.  It was crowded going up but it wasn’t crowded going down.  Once the cable car reached the top, you still need to walk up several flights of steps to the N Seoul Tower.  The cable car ride was about 3 minutes long."
5,4.0,"The Namsan Cable Car takes you up to the N Seoul Tower Complex. The cable cars give you an all round view of the city as you ascend to the mountain top. To get to the cable cars from street level at Namsan third tunnel, there is a funicular elevator that goes up the short distance to the cable car station – and this takes about two minutes. The funicular is free. The maximum capacity is 20 people and operating hours are 10:00-23:30 to match the operatings of Namsan Cable Car.The ticket price for the Namsan cable car is 8,500 Won return ticket for an adult (equivalent to about GBP 6.00 Aug 2017). The queues build up during the late afternoon/early evening times as a lot of visitors travel during these times to get a daytime and nighttime view of the N Seoul tower. If you wish to avoid the queues, you should go in the mornings. The cable car operates from 10am to 11pm."
6,3.0,After midday you'll be looking at a long wait.  Each car can get like 40 people in but they only run every 10 mins. I was there 10.30 and waited about 15 mins including ticket.  I recommend the cable car up and walk down.  Cost for adult 6000 KRW
7,5.0,"It might be a bit crowded, but it is worth taking the cable car in the hot summer days instead of walking to the hilltop. It is not that pricey and it is fast."
8,3.0,"Namsan Cable Car runs from the base of Namsam Mountain up to Namsam Park. It is the easiest and most convenient way to get up to the N Seoul Tower. Glass on ALL four sides giving riders a wider view of the surrounding cityscape. The entrance fee is 8,000 Korea won."
9,2.0,"I sure am glad I went during a quiet time and had only a minimal wait - especially after reading other reviews talking about 2 hour waits for this underwhelming 3 minute cable car ride. I would have been furious to wait that long for this banal experience.If I hadn't done the Bukhansan hike the day before, I probably would have just walked up but I was feeling lazy. In future I think I'd either walk up or take a taxi.Not sure why the cable car runs only every ten minutes. Seems like it could go more frequently than that and cut down on waiting times.If you arrive and there's a long queue, I'd highly recommend making other arrangements to get to the top of the hill."
10,4.0,"As per the title of the review, it's very near and easy to find from Myeondong stn exit 3. And in the cable car, you can see beautiful view. One point to note is that they will squeeze the cable car fully. FULLY.  So if you wanna take photo on the way up, it's a pretty hard. But if you are going to go to Namsan Tower Observatory, you can even more beautiful scenery there :))"
11,3.0,The Namsan hill is very steep so that makes this cable cart very useful. The views are nice but the carts are way too crowded so it will be hard to enjoy the view. Luckily the ride only costa a few Euros and it saves up a lot of time.
12,2.0,"This is your typical cable car like there are so many, with a nice view along the way that quickly brings you to the N Seoul Tower. However, I was there on a Saturday evening and it was very crowded - had to wait for an hour. You'd be better of taking the stairs: you don't have to wait, it is free, you can take time to enjoy the views along the way, it is not that far in the end and you'll get a great workout while climbing!"
13,2.0,"In the same price I could take a taxi.The ride it self is pretty short, and you really ""pay"" by waiting. It would be nice if they told you there is a big line to get on the cable car(and it is not visible when you are on the other line to get the ticket). It was two floors line, took 20 minutes to get on the cable car. Also be aware that there is a line on the way down too(little bit shorter, but maybe it was because of the hour)"
14,3.0,"The cable cars have glass all around htat gives you some decent views, but nothing compared to the views you get at the top of Namsan Tower or at the top of the hill.  But it is worth the cost round trip if you don't feel like hiking.  I didn't have time for the hike."
15,3.0,"I visited on a weekday at around 11 am, the queue to buy the cable car ticket was long but moved quite fast. I didn't really like the experience of queuing to ride the cable car though, the attendants pack everyone in like sardines, and people just push their way into it for the window view. I will rather take the bus and hike up to Namsan Tower."
16,5.0,"This location is a 20 minute walk uphill from Namsangol Hanok Village, or a short cab ride for 3,000 won. The cost of 8,500 won was worth it to me for a round trip ticket in the cable car. It cut time down instead of trying to walk up the hill. The day I went was gloomy and sprinkling but the cable car was still running. While visiting in the afternoon, very busy with tourists so you will be packed like sardines in the cable car. Lots of restaurants outside of entrance of cable car. Highly recommend to save time and shoe leather."
17,4.0,"if you don't like making a walk up the mountain, the cable car is a very cheap alternative for a round-trip ride up to the N Tower."
18,4.0,"Even though it's expensive and little bit uncomfortable, you can go to the Namsan tower much easily :)"
19,4.0,"it was expensive, but i wanted to try at least for once. Instead of walking up the hill I took the cable car, the summer view was great."
20,5.0,"I walked namsan park from Seoul Train station so I'd already had a pretty good workout following the Seoul city wall. It's worth the 8,500 ₩....yes it is. You get a return trip for that price.  Be aware you do get crammed in. 7,000 ₩ if you want a one way trip. Pretty nice views on the way....be prepared for a little swaying as people seem to like moving around in the car!"
21,3.0,Buy your ticket to go to the top and then walk down. It takes about a five minutes journey and is very busy. I was packed in and couldn't take any photos!
22,4.0,"Walk up to N. Seoul Tower if you have the energy.  Or take a bus up.  The line is soooooooo long.  It took me almost 2 hours to walk from myeongdong to the outside elevator that takes you up to here (the elevator also had a line but not as long as the cable car line).  Then another 2 hours to get on the cable car.It was nice though.  But very crowded.  Tip for future visitors.  If you want to use the cable car and see the sunset at N. Seoul Tower, COME HERE AT LEAST 4 HOURS BEFORE SUNSENT."
23,4.0,"Walking from Myeongdong, I found it very hard to find where the cable car station was located even with the official Seoul Visitors Map as my guide. Once I found a very handy lift that takes you from the top of a long staircase up from street-level to the cable car station, I didn't have any more problems. I bought a return ticket and only had short waits each time for the car to come. Both trips were somewhat crowded, so I had limited ability to take in the impressive views of Seoul below."
24,4.0,"I didn't plan on going on the cable car but my knees and feet were still sore after my hike up to Hallasan in Jeju before I went to Seoul. So I skipped walk to the N Seoul Tower and bought myself a return ticket for the cable car ride. As expected, everything was very well organized and maintained. Buying the ticket was super fast. No problem finding the way to the cable car. No problem getting into the cable car although a huge crowd was slowly queueing up - no drama, no unsatisfied customers making a scene because they had to wait too long, nothing. Everything went smoothly.The ride was short but I did get a good view of beautiful Seoul from inside the cable car. The announcements were also made in English. Clean. reliable schedule, professional staffs,the toilets were clean, there's a cafe/mini convenience store  to get a cuppa and what have yous. A good experience all in all."
25,4.0,"It was a bit expensive ($6 for one way, and $8,5 for two ways), but if you are too lazy to climb up the hill, or too afraid of going down, or don't have much time, I recommend you to use since it only took less than 5 minutes to reach the tower. But it based on luck because normally you have to queue."
26,3.0,"Although convenient, the cable car costs 8500 KRW for a return trip and can be quite crowded. You are not guaranteed to see anything, it just makes the trip up the mountain quickly. While I did not have to wait too long, others in the queue said that they had been waiting for some time - the operators do not appear to have a time schedule and only send cable cars up and down when the numbers are close to maximum."
27,4.0,"This is an easy way to get up to the Tower. I'm of retirement years and currently have a slightly sore stubbed toe, but only bought the upward trip. No regrets. Walking down was not too strenuous. It's worth finding the free lift between the same level as the subway exit. I climbed up to lower station by aiming for the PRC Embassy, not knowing there is a free lift if you follow the more major road. I only found that by walking down. Between the upper cable car and the Seoul Tower, I bought some delicious fried spiral potato. Spring seems to be late this year so the trees were a bit bereft of bud."
28,4.0,"Adult price 8000Kr for round trip.6000Kr for one-way.I went to the Seoul tower by cable car.It was working very smoothly to the upper hill and back to the lower deck.Seoul tower was built on the hill which named Namsam.There was a good view point near the tower.You can have something to drink and take a look at such a beautiful city.When you wanna entered the tower,the entry fee should be 22000Kr."
29,5.0,"Perfect shortcut to N Seoul Tower if you don't want to walk though the park (or if its too cold or dark). 8,000 for a return ticket, or 6,000 for one way."
