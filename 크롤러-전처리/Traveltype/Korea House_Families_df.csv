0,5.0,"I had ZERO expectations for this as a cultural show isn’t usually up my alley but someone else on our trip booked this and it ended up being a highlight from our trip. The dinner is a multi-course affair and is based on royal meals of the past. There are 3 options, and they all come with plenty of food in tasting portion sizes. It’s not your typical Korean meal that you will find in the U.S. or even most Seoul restaurants, but it was all fine. The real treat was the 1-hour long show. The story is based on a Korean folk tale and is performed by a talented group of dancers and other performers. There are also musicians that play traditional instruments to accompany the performance. Without spoiling too much, there was also a fun audience participation element that was a nice surprise. In the end, it ended up being an entertaining way to see a little bit of Korean cultural history."
1,5.0,"It was a fabulous experience.   Our driver and guide, Paul, were very good.  Paul was very knowledgeable about the city and very polite, funny, and caring.  The dinner was great, and the show was fantastic,  although the sound was loud.  Overall the experience was very good."

The atmosphere is warm and welcoming while giving you a sense of something g special to come. We were ushered to our table, but first we had to take off our shoes. The dinner was phenomenal-too much to list here but the food just kept coming. We had the traditional korean side dishes, but also Korea. Crepes (savory), beef tips, prime beef, a seafood salad of octopus, shrimp, scallops, radish, and lotus, a warm green tea ginseng chicken porridge, bibimbap, sweets and what can only be described as grapefruit tea. Delicious!The show is an hour long and worth every minute. The cast interacts with the audience. The dance and music took my breath away. At the end of the show all I could say was “wow!”  If you get a chance while in Seoul I would highly recommend visiting Korea house"

Its a very popular folktale in  Korea. The actors were fantastic and engaging. My family and I enjoyed the show very much.The royal cuisine that we had after the show was delicious. However i do feel that i had to eat fast as the servers tend to bring the food out very quickly, like as if they are in a hurry to close. We ordered 3 sets of the most basic menu thinking my 5 yr old daughter would enjoy the food too. Its a mistake as the food is not to her liking. The bean paste stew was spicy and hence she couldn’t eat it too!She ended up only hvg plain white rice, which i scoop out from her bimbimbap. So in case u r bringing young kids along, u may wana consider the option of sharing or preparing some simple food for the kids. Other than that, i think its a really good experience!"
4,5.0,"We three adults went to Korea House for an evening meal. We choose a set menu and thoroughly enjoyed it. Each course was beautifully presented and the waitresses who were also dressed beautifully in traditional costumes, explained what we were eating and how we should eat the dishes. We found the experience very enjoyable and something very different which we had do done before. The individual dishes are small and delicate however after 10 or so courses we left very satisfied. I see people comment about the food being expensive, however you get what you pay for. if you are looking for beautifully presented food and quality over quantity I would highly recommend this restaurant."
5,5.0,"Yes, it is expensive but this is one of the few tourist friendly places where you can try the Imperial cuisine (food only the king used to eat). You will not find the Imperial cuisine in your home country.The restaurant is in an old, beautiful Hanok (traditional Korean home) and the waiters all wear traditional Korean clothes. The service is excellent. The food is delicious. You can choose to alsopay to watch traditional dancing if you want."

7,5.0,"I cannot say enough about our experience.  We were easily able to buy tickets online and pick them up on site.  We were able to walk around a bit before the performance and enjoy the atmosphere.  The traditional performance was beautifully staged, great singing, and lots of humor.  If you want a night out enjoying a traditional performance pick the Korea House."
8,3.0,"This is an easy place to go to via subway.  Great garden.  Should definitely go for the Show which starts at 630pm for about 1 hour. We had the Royal Traditional Menu and it was a disappointment. We booked 2 so called Royal Traditional Meal from two location so we can compare.  And Korea House was bad in food quality, taste and service (rushed, makes me wonder if Royalty were that rushed in having their meals).  The other place is Seokparang. No show but the food was really good."
9,3.0,"traditional and well made.Shows different forms of performing arts: dance, drums, singing and playing instruments. Made up of 8 consecutive sessions, a total of 1 hour. Some of the sessions were quite impressive, while some had me wandering off. Since the theatre was mostly vacant, we were able to sit up front so was even nicer.In total- a very cultural (and a bit too pricy) way to pass an hour, but for the most part not thrilling."
