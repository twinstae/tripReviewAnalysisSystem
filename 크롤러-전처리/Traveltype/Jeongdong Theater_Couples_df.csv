1,5.0,"We saw ""The Palace"" at Jeongdong Theatre and were blown away by the performance. I am a high school drama teacher, so I'm often looking to see traditional pieces when we travel. This theatre didn't disappoint. The small venue has nothing but excellent seating - there isn't a bad seat in the house. The performance showcased traditional costumes, stories, dancing, music, and drama and was thoroughly engaging. I highly recommend taking in a piece here if you are in Seoul. Tip - check out the 1/2 price tickets available on Wednesdays. :)"
2,4.0,"The MISO Show has ended and now playing is Youll.  Easy to follow with the English subtitles on one side of the stage. Dramatic lighting, dance, pantomime, contemporary music mixed in with the traditional, and energy of the actors will keep you captivated throughout.  Good indoor activity if your legs are tired from all the walking and it's a rainy day."
3,4.0,"I enjoyed the Youll show, although I thought it was best suited to a young audience.  I had hoped for more traditional dancing and costuming, but this was a traditional story given a modern twist.  Easy to follow, with English phrasing on boards at the side of the stage.  I'm a bit of a theatre ""addict"" so found this performance to be quite ""pantomime"" standard.  Cute fairies with their feather wands...  Nice way to spend an hour, but wouldn't say it was a ""must see""."
4,5.0,"We saw a flyer for the show Youll at Jeongdong theatre and were apprehensive. Not speaking Korean we were worried we wouldn't have a clue what was going on, but the show itself was very easy to follow - there wasn't a lot of dialogue but the majority of it had English (and Chinese) subtitles at the side of the stage but even without these it would have been very easy to follow. The traditional Korean dance, singing, music etc was excellent to watch and I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Seoul, myself and my partner loved it."
