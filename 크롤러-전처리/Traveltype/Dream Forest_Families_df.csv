0,5.0,"There are several huge parks in Seoul. This is one of them and I think this is the best public park.- The location is quite away from touristic areas. Line #6 Dolgoji Station is the nearest. But, it's also too far to walk. Take #147 bus to get there.- The highlight of the park is the free observatory. It's on the hill and you should get in two funiculars to get there. Walking is better and faster if you're healthy. The view from the open observatory on top is wonderful.- Unlike Seoul Forest, this isn't so distracting with many bicycles.- Many people relaxing in tents.- There are Hanok house, restaurant, deer farm, pond, pavilion, convenience store, cultural center, etc.- Better to visit during cherry blossom or fall foliage."
