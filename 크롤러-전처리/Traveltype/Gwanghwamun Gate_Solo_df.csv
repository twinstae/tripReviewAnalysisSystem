0,5.0,One of the many  traditional and historical gates of the city that welcomes you to the past while standing in the middle of the modern technology of the present
1,4.0,"I was very impressed by this massive, ceremonial entrance to Gyeongbokgung Palace. When I first arrived I thought there was a row of mannequins dressed as imperial guards, but they are real! They stands so still, honestly it's quite remarkable. The gate is beautiful when seen from both sides. It is possible to see it for free as the ticket booth is well inside the gate.The changing of the guard ceremony is quite something else but even if you are not there for that, it's a magnificent gate and well worth a lingering stop on my opinion"
2,4.0,"This is the southern gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace and is the main entrance to the palace. It has 3 arched gates. Formerly, the centre gate was used by the king, while the other two were used by crown prince and royal officials.Upon entering the gate is a huge square where the changing of guards take place. It is free for public viewing as it is just before the palace entrance where ticket is required. Hence time yourself to witness the changing of the guards ceremony at 1000hr and 1400hr daily."
3,5.0,"Be sure to visit around the changing of the guard, if you want a photo with the guards they are OK with that, just do not interact with them, stand alongside and take the pic easily.Once you've checked out the gate, continue through and check out the HUGE palace complex."

7,5.0,"If you can time a visit here with that of the changing of the guard it’s a wonderful experience. From admiring the outfits, the beating of the drums and the traditional marching it feels really authentic. It drew quite a crowd on my visit so it’s worth getting there early if you want a prime view!Lots of visitors dress in traditional outfits adding to the atmosphere. There’s plenty to look at without having to enter the main temple area but the contrast between the surrounding modern cityscape and the history inside is inspiring. If you’re in the city then popping in is a must!"

10,5.0,"The Gwanghwamun Gate is very prominently located at the northern end of Sejongno ""boulevard"" at a busy intersection with pretty heavy traffic. It is the main and largest gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace, in Jongno-gu, Seoul. I visited this area one Saturday afternoon and I was absolutely thrilled to bits to walk into the square behind the gate and find that a major, colourful show was in progress. It seemed to be the reenactment of a major battle from the Joeseon Dynasty many centuries ago. I couldn't follow the story line but  the King and his courtiers seemed to be in attendance as well as two colourful opposing factions who went through some rather spectacular fighting scenes to the accompaniment of music, lots of drumming and gong bashing. And all for free. Wonderful.  And made all the better by having the luck of beautiful warm, sunny weather"

There is no admission fee to pass through the Gwanghwamun Gate to observe the Changing of the Guard Ceremony.You do need to buy a ticket to pass through the next gate, Heungnyemun Gate, to enter the grounds of Gyeongbokgung Palace.  The ticket office is just to the right after passing through the Gwanghwamun Gate.The Changing of the Guard Ceremony occurs in the courtyard between the Gwanghwamun Gate and the Heungnyemun Gate.  There is no shade in the courtyard when watching the Changing of the Guard Ceremony and it is advisable to wear a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen.  Some people used umbrellas to provide shade."

21,4.0,"This gate is the main gate of the Gyeongbukgung Palace. It was founded by the first king of the Joseon Dynasty in the late 14th century. They say that it translates to “may the light of enlightenment cover the world.” The gate is made of granite and the centre has a gate tower above it.  During the Japanese occupation of Korea, the original gate was destroyed. The present gate was rebuilt in the late sixties using concrete. Gwanghwamun has its name written on a sign on the gate, and it was personally written by former President Park Jeong-Hui. There is a changing of the guard ceremony that takes place every morning. It is very colourful and a joy to watch.On either side of the gate you can see the word “Haetae” which is a mythical unicorn-lion that is said to protect palaces from fire. Admission to the gate is free."

29,4.0,"I alighted at Gyeokbokgung stn but left via Gwanghwamun station exit 9. To me, i thought Gwanghwamun was nearer. At the point of my time visiting, there was some form of flea market and further down there is this Sewol ferry disaster memorial happening. 3,000 won for the basic entrance. There is guard changing ceremony happening twice a day. Worth watching. Other than that, it is all good. Must visit when you are in Seoul!"

32,4.0,"On its own it will not tickle the pinkies, but with ceremonial guards it becomes a favourite with the tourists. And for this reason it is best to get in early before the bus loads of selfie stick toting tourists arrive. It is the only way to get a reasonably tourist free photo. If you are in the area for a while then also watch the changing of the guards from the outside."

I came here by accident while on my way to the US embassy and it was quite a site.  Interesting to see such a traditional landmark right next to very modern buildings surrounding that area.  Theres a cool statue of the legendary General YiSunSin.  Probably one of the greatest naval commander in history.
