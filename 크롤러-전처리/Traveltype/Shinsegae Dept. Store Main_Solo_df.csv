0,3.0,good meeting point. tours start in front (facing woori  bank) browse around.  enjoy a snack at the many coffee shops.  walk the perimeter to orient the shopping and landmarks.
1,5.0,"I always laugh when I read reviews from people bashing a high end store for having high end items. If you can't roll with the big boys, stay on the porch. There's everything in here for every type of fashion you could want from minks to street wear. There's also a supermarket, street style food booths and other restaurants in the basement. If you've ever been to Harrod's, that's basically what this is. Well worth a visit if you're into fashion."
2,3.0,"If you are looking for luxury goods such as cosmetics, perfumes, handbags and clothes, you can come here and buy these products. They offer duty free if you bring your passport. This is well catered for Mainland Chinese tourists, since almost all the staff speak Putonghua."
3,4.0,"I went to Shinsegae Department Store during my visit to Seoul in October 2018. It was a great shopping mall with world class boutiques and other high-end products. Unless you were looking for high-end products or boutiques like Louis Vuitton, etc, this is definitely not your place to shop."
4,3.0,"Unless you are looking for expensive stuff, this is not for you. It's a regular mall with branded goods and for some reason, they don't have a handful of newborn stuff like breastpumps etc. Their infant selection are very limited as well. You can come here if you want to chill or get some warmth haha But really, if you are into cheaper stuff, you might as well go somewhere else."
5,3.0,"This store is very attractive, clean, and well-maintained. There are lots of luxury goods and a good selection of clothing and home items."
6,4.0,"When you want to buy luxury, this may be the shopping place. At least 3 floors for duty free buying. I was looking for baby clothing but need to say better ones Iâ€™ll find in my own country.  Only baby pink and blue!Anyway an experience - especially the Food store."
7,5.0,Nice department store with wide selection of international and local brand.Roof restaurant is nice but this time was closed for restructuring.
8,5.0,"I was walking from Myeongdong to Hoehyeon and passed by the Shinsegae Department Store.  The facade of the building was grand and elegant, could tell it was from the early 20th century."
9,5.0,"Over the years I have been living and working in Korea I have found Shinsegae staff consistently courteous, attentive and helpful at every one of their stores I have visited in Seoul. Even though many staff don't speak English they always spare no effort listening to me and trying to understand what it is I am asking about. I have always left the store feeling satisfied with the customer service I have received. Yes, I know their prices are high but the prices are equally high but without the customer service at the other ""big name"" stores in Seoul in my experience!In contrast I dread asking staff anything, even the price in English at E mart (same company as Sinsegae) or Hyundai stores - the usual reply is ""sorry, no English"" or ""obsoyo"" and then staff quickly move away and ""disappear"" so they don't have to serve me.Yesterday I visited Shinsegae's main store in Myeongdong hoping to get help to buy an armchair using a Shinsegae/Emart gift voucher I had been given. I had had a very bad experience two days previously at Yeoju Emart where the armchair was not in stock and where I was trying to purchase the chair which was available at another Emart store too far away from Yeoju for me to carry and transport home on the bus myself.At Shinsegae I explained my predicament, the store attendant immediately asked me to wait a minute please while he called a staff member who could speak English. The customer attention I received was productive and pleasant. After discussion and phone calls the staff found a way for me to purchase the armchair which was available on the online Shinsegae Mall after I converted my gift voucher into Shinsegae points (I hold a member's card). The points were used to purchase the item. The whole process was rather complex because I did not have an ID or password so in fact to organise, it took considerable time and effort on the part of the staff member and the ladies in the Customer Service Department.As per my initial comment, in my experience the staff at Shinsegae Stores are prepared to ""go the extra mile"" to help their non-Korean-speaking customers, something I highly commend them for and I really appreciate. I went home a very happy, satisfied customer!I recommend other non-Korean-speakers to shop at Shinsegae for excellent customer service and I hope other foreigners likewise have similar good experiences shopping at Shinsegae."
