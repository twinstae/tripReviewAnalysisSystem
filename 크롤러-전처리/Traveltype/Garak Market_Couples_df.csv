You can purchase these and then go upstairs and have them cooked.  Relatively cheaper than outside and you can see the fish prior to purchasing.  We arrived around 5.15pm on a Monday and it was relatively quiet"

You couldn't even really look around without them trying to sell their produce in a very pushy manner. There also is a strong language barrier, so I'd suggest bringing a friend along that can help translate for you."

This was picked for my dining option after visiting Common Ground, which is along the way of subway.Having done some online research, despite Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market is the most famous market, many feedbacks are negative for the extra high price for tourists and there are occasions report on fraud.Garak Market has an official website with price per kg of seafood listed which made things more easy.There are very few tourists, I went to a restaurant upstairs first, where I seeked the staff to go with me shop for seafood downstairs. The food are delicious. King crab and fish soup are must try."

It is better if you could speak a bit mandarin or Korean if you would like to bargain for better price.  We ate at the restaurant advised by the lady who sold us the seafood and the seafood were fresh, delicious and well cooked.   We tried Alaska crab, abalone and different shellfish as well as fresh octopus sashimi (moving throughout the night!) It is also fun to walk round the market as you will be amazed at the variety of seafood that have.  Would recommend to seafood lovers."
