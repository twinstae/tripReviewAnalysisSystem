Highly recommended to stay near the area if you enjoy street food with reasonably priced restaurants, fashionable streetwear, clubbing/bar hoping and noraebong (karaoke rooms). Everything night is a Friday night so a warning to those who don’t enjoy crowds and noise until the wee hours of the morning."
3,4.0,"Reading all the reviews here on trip advisor i stayed 3 days here and 2 days at Itaewon.I have to say - i liked it better here. Itawon is very touristy, so if you need to get a true flavor of Korea, stay here, The streets are very busy- i'd say till 12 midnight on weekdays, and till early am 8am on weekends. They have some amazing Barbeque places @ 9000 KRW for Pork/Beef Barbeque that gives you free sides and a dedicated table to cook, But u need to order minimum 2 dishes. amazing experience + music on the streets is fantastic. Very lively, loved it here."

I like it for having foreign brands stores, such as h&m, forever21 etc. Also, it’s a great place to buy some other stuff, cheap smartphone cases and cosmetics - in one place. There are many, many pretty cafes near, very instagramable places. Also, be sure to visit Yongnamdong (Hongik Uni St. exit 3) for some really good food."

Although it is very busy (which was surprising with the temperature being below zero) I never felt overwhelmed by the crowd as I often do in other places. It is so full of life, with street performers and food vendors and plenty of good (and affordable) shops lining each side. The street performers were young dance groups and musicians, which were much more enjoyable than say, the robot people in Times Square or the kazoo men in Barcelona; these performers were genuinely entertaining.

Gate 9 of Hongik Ip Gu (University) metro station is the one that's the most frequented and sometimes, it would take you over ten minutes to get from the bottom of the stairs to the top of the stairs.  If you haven't been to Seoul before, then, this should be a rather eye widening encounter for you.  You only live once...Why not..."

118,5.0,It is very good impression to visit this place during day and night time. This place is the center of university area in Seoul that you may face nice local dining whole day. You may have coffee or dessert in the afternoon and hang out late night in the evening. There is also street local performance in the park up the stairs. Don't miss it.
119,5.0,"Having lived in Seoul for three years,  this  place is definetly the best.  Interesting cafes, live music and street performances,  plenty of delicious restaurants and a young vibrant seen.  Lots of bars and clubs for after party and the pricing is some of the cheapest in Seoul depending on which bars you go to. In my opinion far cheaper and more artistic and creative buildings and places to eat,  drink and chill than Gangnam. For a night out or even a nice meal or coffee come here. So many new places always open up.  Some of my favs include bar 다 and vent. As well as the coffee shops up the hill."
120,4.0,"Not sure how it was in the morning but it gets lively at night. I stayed at boa guest house so it's just a 5 minutes walk away.

This place has become sooooo trendy that is lacks what it once was (unique) - there are many other places in Seoul that are hip. This place, to me, is good for shopping and being surrounded by commerce. Actually sad what this place has become, then again, sad what happened to music in Korea.... Bang bang bang,,, Mehhhhh.

148,3.0,"This is my second visit to Hongik University Street. It wasn't as exciting as it was during my last visit. Maybe it was a weekday night this time. Did not see any street baskers at night. Which was quite a disappointment. The shops looked the same as I last time. This time round, not many shops caught my attention. Nevertheless, it was still a nice experience to take a walk there in the evening. We found a very posh yet chic cafe in the area. A unique cafe with a pub on the second floor. Nice and relaxing way to rest the tired feet as well as have a nice hot cup of coffee or tea."

It had super delicious stuff! I recommend you guys to go there one time!) But what's best of all is the performers.If you go to Hongae, the streets are filled with performers. People dang, since, cheer, and sometimes they even do magic tricks. Oh, and for the Karaoke lovers- at the end of the street, you'll find Soo-Noraebang.They have rooms for one people, two people and groups.

173,5.0,"stayed in hongdae again during my recent trip to seoul. It will be my first choice district to stay during a holiday cos of the convenience that it's connected to the AREX line and subway line 2. Many street food, shops, restaurants, cafes to keep you busy till late nights. The place can be very crowded as it is a university district but I recommend it cos of the convenience, cheap street food, countless cafes and the stores don't close that early. my friend who travelled with me was visiting seoul for the first time and she also loved the area that she would choose to stay in hongdae district if she goes to seoul again :) for shopping/eating/cafehopping/clubbing wise, you can easily spend an entire day here. oh yes, there are street performances as well. the free market only takes place in the non-winter seasons."

(i checked, nope, no special program, its just how this place is like.) definitely one of the most vibrant and youthful place in Korea. if you need shopping, food, drinks, performance etc etc.. you name it you pretty much can get everything here! (except if you are seeking luxurious products. its a UNIVERSITY zone, so can't be expecting students to be able to afford such things, as least not yet.)"

189,3.0,"There are a ton of theme sealed streets throughout Seoul, do not let them distract you from the bigger sites though; yes some of them are interesting and beautiful women hang out there but if you are strapped for time, it is essential you stick to the bigger, main goals first and spoil yourself with lost secrets later.The coffee shops and easy paced life is nice for a Sunday stroll."
190,3.0,The street has lots of sacks and jewelry stores.  But you can find most of the items in other shopping places.  It also has lots of stores for younger adults but I am not sure about the quality or prices.  I did not see anything tempting.  I would only visit if I have more than 7 days in Seoul.
191,4.0,It's a nice street to walk around especially weekend. A lot of hip & chic stuffs to see & buy. Tons of cafe and street food to taste. On Sat & Sun at 'Playground' (In front of Hongik University) will have free market.
192,4.0,"Universities are supposed to be great serious higher institutions of learning and research but it appears to be the culture here in South Korea as well as in Taiwan to inject the youthful, trendy and vibrant street shopping dynamism into the atmosphere of sobriety that usually characterized that of the `ivory towers'. You hardly find such mega trendy shops right at the entrance of our National University of Singapore (NUS) or at the Nanyang Technological Institute of Singapore (NTU). But I would think that such close proximity to entertainment outlets and shopping malls would definitely help to reduce the stresses and anxieties over examinations.  We stayed at BoA Guesthouse which was within walking distance from Hongik University. On our last day, we took a walk around the shopping areas of the University. We went into a spa and relax ourselves for about 2 hours before wandering around the many shops and cafes. It was fascinating to see students hang out in the many eateries, busking activities, performance and arts galleries at almost every corner of the street. Even some of the walls were painted with arts. The adjourning area outside the campus looks like an extended area for their student activities and it brings vibrancy and dynamism to the whole street. I also observed that the shops and entertainment outlets engaged the students to run their businesses on a part-time basis. Many of the counter staff at the BoA Guesthouse where we stayed were actually manned by Hongik University students who worked there on a part time basis. At night, the weather was cold. We went to a restaurant along Hongik Street to have our dinner. It was warm inside the restaurant brightened by the incandescent lamps. The food resembled our `Yong Tau Foo' (fish beancurd) in Singapore and was deliciously cooked to our appetite. We were the only `senior citizens' in the restaurant as all the other customers were young undergraduate students from Hongik University. After the dinner, we had a relaxed walk in the cold weather looking at some of the street performances.  Nice ambience, nice food, trendy and vibrant environment."

206,5.0,Go during the weekends to see live performance! Nice shopping and beautiful streets! you can see all the local students hanging around
207,5.0,"Cool place. This is perfect place for youngsters out there. A lot of shopping, food, deserts, bars, musician, artists, and clubs!!"
208,5.0,If you like shopping.. come here and shop and eat like crazy.. Saturdays a lot of students can be found with their bands and playing loud music on the streets.
209,4.0,One of the better few shopping areas in Seoul. There are many restaurants and cafes for you to try too.
210,5.0,"A lot of cool stuff for everyone especially for the youth! A place where you can share your talents with the public. Also a place where you can eat street foods, party 'til midnight, shop and buy cute cheap stuff!"
211,5.0,"Great place to check out University Fashion as well as aspiring K-Pop stars. Along the streets would be groups of young people or singles performing - dancers, singers, bands. Fantastic! And they all could sing and dance, play music really well. I think some of them already had their own ""groupies"". It was enjoyable watching the performances. It is also a great food street. Each night I just went for the Korean BBQ which was really reasonable. You should try a different Korean BBQ place each night as each one does their BBQ differently. Yum! There were loads of little fashion shops too as well the big names like H & M. Lots to see and buy."
212,4.0,Lots of shopping and karaoke and little shops and cafes to enjoy. Great place to meet up with friends.
213,5.0,"My friend and I did a lot of shopping there. All the stores there are quite trendy and stylish. And most importantly, they are not expensive. As long as you are slim enough, you could get a lot of good clothes with good price. When you get tired from shopping, there are lots of restaurants and some coffee shops at that area. During the night hours, many young people would do some performance on the street which is very cool. I would say this is a must-visit place in Seoul for girls, especially a bunch of girls traveling together!"
214,4.0,"This is definitely a place for young and cool people! Lot's of funky cafe's and restaurants, hip stores, and street performers. Many korean bbq restaurants but not that many restaurants have vegetarian/vegan friendly food around this area, took us ages to find one restaurant that served bean cakes, but there are a ton of cafes we wanted to visit and got hungry for something salty in between. Go to the Hello Kitty cafe if you are looking for a pink cuteness overdose, or try some of the street food joints selling fish shaped pan cakes filled with ice cream, drink a soda with cotton candy in it or have an ice cream made with liquid nitrogen- you find it all here. Definitely worth just walking around and enjoying the atmosphere if you are nearby."
215,4.0,I went there on Saturday night and it was so crowded but in a good way. There're many clothing stores and interesting street performances along the way.
216,5.0,"Korea is a city that never sleeps, so no matter where you go you'll never really be disappointed, however the whole Hongik is not to be missed. There's a buzz around the area that is infectious and although the streets get busier and busier as the day goes on, you never feel as though you're drowning in people. There is always something to do, something to see, something to buy, something to eat, and as it's a bustling place you're likely to find the newest fashions in food and clothes dotted around the area. Shops here change frequently, so no matter how many times you go you'll always find something new. It's also very easy to get to however it can be incredibly confusing to go around and I have gotten lost a few times so keep your eyes out for landmarks. If you want to go when it's a little quieter the mornings are great, however the shops all open at different times so you may be waiting a little."
217,4.0,"This is a great area to hang around on.. whether it is a weekend or weekday. The people watching is the best part of this area. Take advantage of the cheap phone cases, cheap drinks, free music, and plethora of BBQ places. Personally, I love cheesy dalk galbi, which is near exit 9 and H&M."
218,5.0,"Searching for the best food in town ~KFC (Korean fried chicken), I found the streets amusing. Filled with many young talents, I felt that it brings out the interest in young guns nowadays.At night, a total different atmosphere develops. Lights which brighten the sky creates a romantic scene for couples in this street."
219,5.0,"By day loads of food options, both restaurants and street vendors. Delicious and varied.Plenty of shops too.At night it gets even busier, with local youngsters strutting their stuff in the many bars and cool nightclubs.Overall, a lot of fun!"
220,4.0,"Very convenient area with lots of young and happening people. Lots of street eats, local artists performing and enjoying the arts that Seoul brings. Great selection of food and shopping with reasonable prices. The clubs are a must to check out if you are a party goer. The vibrant night life makes it all the more exciting as the night goes on!"
221,5.0,"It is kind of ""amusement street"" in my opinion. Because, there are restaurants,  cafe, street food, shopping alley, museum (Trickeye museum, ice museum, love museum). In my case I enjoyed like this: Go to there. Look around alleys by watching trendy chothes, hats and accessories.  Go to the TrickEye museum, Ice museum,  Love museum. Enjoy some street food. And eat Jjimdak (chicken). It will take about 2 hours. :)"
222,5.0,"Hongdae has a lot of surprises for you if you decided to go there whiteout a plan. The best way to experience it is to just wonder arround the streets, go in to one of the many many small boutiques, skate stores, vintage stores etc, have a coffee in one of the many unique coffee places and eat delicious food in crappy looking restaurants. If you have not had enough, after that, there are hundreds of bars and clubs you can go to to have a Korean style night out. I would recommend to explore the part that is close to the Hapjeong station as there are less franchises and more cooler stores and bars down that way."
223,5.0,"Nightfall finally arrived and we were ready to paint the town red! We met up with a friend that we made at the San Francisco Airport by means of spilling coffee near him, which led to an amazing conversation and exchange of phone numbers. For our first night out we decided to hit up the popular Hongdae district. Known for its young and hip crowd, we quickly fell in love with the area for its food, shopping, and live street performances. Did I already I tell you that I love kdrama? I felt like I was dreaming! There was never a boring moment there.After bouncing from bar to bar we finally settled at the well-named ""Ho Bar"". It was by far one of the best nightlife I’ve enjoyed ever. The bass was deep, the music was alive, and I felt high on life. Ho Bar has something similar to what we call a bottle service in America, but instead of having a server bring us drinks on request, at Ho Bar they provided finger food and they handed us the entire bottle to drink at our own leisure. Half of the bottle later, the entire club was on tables and chairs dancing wildly as the music seem to get louder and louder. A group of guys knowing that we were foreigners even tried to out dance my partner. A local guy even tried to get fresh with my best friend. It was an awesome night! In fact, it was so awesome and I was so wasted that I even thought I saw celebrity Kim Soo Hyun sitting at the table text to us. It was now sometime between 4-5 am and the streets were still alive with everyone either passing out at the coffee shops or cramming into the nearest street food tent to sober up. I honestly have no idea how we even got home."
224,4.0,"Hongdae is the hotspot for the youngsters in Korea. There are many shops which sell affordable clothes, cosmetics, shoes and accessories. There are also many famous restaurant which the well-known one is PaJangMakChang, opened by Haha (one of the running man member). Other than that, you can try the street food as it is much cheaper than those street food you can find in Myeongdong. Prices of the cosmetics is about the same as the shops in those in Myeongdong and I prefer to shop in Hongdae as there's less hassle."
225,4.0,"A place full of youthful vibes with a large number of university students in this area.

I was told by a friend that korean value the importance of arts, therefore they are given platform to perform and sell their art work. In Hongdae, you not only can see people selling artwork, you can also watch people performing magic, dance, and song. These place is a shopping heaven too."
228,4.0,We went on a Saturday to the free (flea) market located at the children's playground near to Hongik University and it was a great find with quirky knick knacks and uniquely designed items. There were also many stores selling fashion items. Many youths visit on a weekend hence it can be quite crowded.
229,5.0,This area is where a lot of nearby university students hang out.  There are lots of markets and food stands set up around with an abundance of shopping where stores stay open quite late (close at around 11PM I believe).

242,4.0,"After our photo fun time at Trickeye Museum, we wandered into a nearby eatery (just around the corner) for lunch. Being a Sunday (and a weekend), Hongdae was bustling with activity and youthful vibrancy throughout. It was an afternoon of frenzied happy shopping and browsing. There were many things to see and so many tempting items to buy. Please check out my blog for more photos: http://www.travelbytez.com/2014/11/daytime-in-hongdae-lunch-at-and-shopping.html"
243,3.0,"It was just okay. The vibe could have been real fun if I was younger. The street musician that I chanced upon was really good, but then I realized that there were more of them and it all became just too loud and noisy for me. There were also a lot of places to eat at and the usual shopping stops plus trendy shops. But I am not a fan of the crowded street."

I was after a ""Chairmen Meow"" jacket, but they were all too short for me. I did manage to find an awesome sweatshirt on sale at a hole in the wall shop at the head of the street. Be sure to peruse the grafitti panels, the many stalls, and the campus itself for some interesting art installations. A must see is the nature cafe, grab a flower tea and hang out with the sheep that they keep outside."

257,5.0,"There are many great nightlife scenes around the globe, each with its specificities and advantages. Some are great for foodies, party animals, hipsters, the ""high-class""... However, few, if any mix them together quite the way Hongdae does. No matter who you are or what you like, there will be something for you in Hongdae. Dorky shops/restaurants, check ; underground concert venues, check ; great restaurants for all tastes and moods, check ; busy clubs with great music, check ; just want to chill out in the street and eat from food carts or convenience stores, check. And all these styles fit together perfectly. Other plus: the crowd. Hongdae is absolutely bustling, from the afternoon until the wee hours, and not only on the week end. The crowd is young, diverse, stylish and casual at the same time. Price-wise, Hongdae is of course a bit more expensive than in other areas in Seoul or Korea, but it's not excessive."

266,4.0,"We stayed near the street. We were quite wondering why the area seemed dull and lifeless.....in the morning. Not until we got lost at night and stumbled upon this area. Everything is the exact opposite of the morning aura! Youth clad in their faddish attires roam the streets, the lights are bright, and the place is inevitably full of energy."
267,4.0,"Dislike - Distance is far from where I stay ( myeongdong ).Taxi fare is more than 10,000krwOf coz, you are always encouraged to travel by subway.

Have to pay 10,000krw for Cats Café."

At night, especially on weekends, they have a bunch of young people performing on the street as you walk around.

278,5.0,"We stayed in a guesthouse located in this area and every night it's very happening. The students are very supportive of the performers, and in this area you will find boutique clothes which you might not find in other places like Myeongdong. There are also various strange cafes like the Piano Cafe, Sheep Cafe, Dog Cafe, Cat Cafes etc here. The strange thing is that if you come here in the morning, it looks like a ghost town, a total contrast from the hustle and bustle of its late-night edition. Great place to hang out with friends or as a couple."
279,5.0,The streets along Hongik University is just something as the sun sets and these artists just show cases their talents... It is a back to back show --- literally!

291,4.0,"Visited here during weekend and it was super crowded. Many youth around, enjoy the young atmosphere here."
292,4.0,"A real hotspot alternative to Myeongdong - not so touristy hence more ""local"". Food prices are reasonable too 'cos the younger uni crowd has less spending power and may be more picky in their selections. Small meandering streets with boutique-style stores are great for wandering in & out of. Some have local designer wares, a nice change from the international over-rated brands. 2 thumbs up!"
293,5.0,Most of the night market at Seoul closes around 5-6 pm but not at Hongik University Street ! you can still enjoy and shop there until 10 pm !
