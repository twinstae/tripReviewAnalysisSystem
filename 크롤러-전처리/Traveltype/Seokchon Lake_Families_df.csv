0,5.0,Beautiful scenery with cherry blossom tree around the lake. Very crowded and better to come earlier. Lotte world theme park with a castle makes it more beautiful like fairy tales. There is a cafe inside. One of the top must visit during spring season in Seoul.

2,5.0,"The lake was not big and the trail around it was easy to walk. When we were there, the cherry blossom was in fully bloom which turned the lake into white and light pink, and I have to say it was amazingly beautiful! We enjoyed the beauty of the lake and the cherry blossom by walking 3 rounds around the lake. Highly recommend to visit it during the cherry blossom season!"
