0,5.0,"take water it's a large park to visit.  if you're up to a work out, walk uphill around the remains of an old fortbest part were the flags / olympic flame and the rose garden.off season without events, only the gate areas have food and beverages"
1,3.0,"The Olympic Park is a very diverse place to start off, lots of trees and sub-nature but also a lot of facilities. You can really experience much in the Olympic Park touring the statues, buildings and more. One thing about the park overall is that the facilities are quite outdated, so if you are a type of person who likes fresh and all clean facilities, I do not recommend this place to you. For me, it was worth paying a visit and if you just want to enjoy your day walking around and touring why not pay a visit to the Olympic Park?"
2,3.0,I love Olympics and the spirit inspires. In this case it didn’t impressed me. I expected more. But happy because I got my selfie.
3,5.0,"It's interesting and pretty. I was there in winter, so there was an ice rink with many people ice skating. There are some coffee shops nearby as well. It's really good for children as well as adults."
4,5.0,"This is where the 1988 summer olympics was held. Easy to go to because there are two subway stations to get here -Mongchontoseong and Olympic Park. You can see sports stadiums, forests and grassy fields. I highly recommend to check out the lone tree."
5,5.0,The only problem with this lovely park is that in sub zero temperatures it’s impossible to walk round all of it.  There is a monument with lots of information about how the games came to Seoul as well as names of all the gold medal winners. The outdoor sculptures are excellent but the indoor display was a bit too modern for me.
6,5.0,"The Olympic Park is most beautiful in autumn, particularly towards sunset. There are two main entrances, Previously I came out from Metro station 813 on Line 8 (Monchontoseong) and could see the Olympic arch right in front of me. However this time I came out of the Olympic Park metro station P550, after changing at Gangdong on Line 5. A bit confused, I walked straight and then walked around the park in a counter-clockwise direction. It took a couple of hours of leisurely walk to get back to Monchongtoseong but it was worth the trouble. The scenery was really beautiful in autumn, all along the walk. At one point I was lost at a junction in the park. The sun was going down but I was still quite far away from the park entrance. The signs were all in Korean (no English); what a pity! Tried Google Map but it was not much help. Anyway, I gambled and took the uphill path on my right instead of the level walk on the left; fortunately it worked out. The path brought me to a bridge and the surrounding sunset scenery was fascinating. Further down, I recognized the large courtyard with many flags; the Monchontoseong station was right behind the Olympic arch. Actually there is a short-cut path between the two main entrances, but if you take this shortcut, you will miss most of the beautiful scenery."
7,4.0,"When i visited this park in early autumn on a weekend afternoon, it was a hub of activity, with young families taking a stroll and youths hanging around the entrance at the southern entrance of the park.It is a spacious park that makes for a nice stroll especially during sunset. Do set aside at least one hour to adequately cover the entire park along with stops to take photos. Best to reach here using the Seoul subway, alight at the Mongchontoseong (World Peace Station) station along the pink line."
8,4.0,"C ( 18.10.22 ) I visited this park on my way to promise. This park was famous and big one in Seoul city. So many people visited there. There was a bigger than I think, and good to enjoy walking. Good park in the city."
9,5.0,"What an experience to explore the location of the 1988 Summer Olympic Games, the site is expansive with several museums and outdoors art/sculpture. The flame is still burning and the Olympic spirit lives on 30 years later."
10,4.0,Very nice area to walk around．Their olympic museum was closed and not much stuff to do but very beautiful park.
11,5.0,"While attending the 2018 Olympic Winter Games in South Korea, I went to see the Peace Arch that I had seen during the.   1988 Summer Games.  It's still as lovely as ever.  Also enjoyed the winter Olympic display that they had featuring Yuna Kim and the Olympic mascots."
12,5.0,"This large park was built for the 1988 Seoul Summer Olympic Games.  The main entrance is hard not to miss with the huge World Peace Gate.  There is a number of sporting facilities from the Games still around.  There are many interesting sculptures in the park.  It’s free to enter the park and you can rent bicycles to ride around the park.  You can also buy a ticket to ride the Hodori Train that goes through the park.The Seoul Olympic Museum is located in the park.  There are also three other museums in the park:  the Seoul Olympic Museum of Art, Seoul Baekje Museum, and the Mongchon Museum.  There is a large man-made lake with numerous walking trails.  There are numerous restaurants and food outlets in the park."
13,5.0,"The Olympic Stadium has been home to Ultra for 7 years now, and this year was no exception. Being able to connect with people from all over the world is an amazing feeling."
14,4.0,"I didn't get to explore the whole park. I just went to the World Peace Gate and walked around it. It's an amazing structure , definitely worth the stop!"
15,4.0,"I came here because of Running man. You will know what I mean if you're running man man fans.Olympic Park is so huge, we can spent 2-3 hours here. Very nice place to see locals people activities."
16,5.0,"This is defiantly my favorite spot in Seoul, I remember that I visited it in my second day there and I was amazed by its beauty, the beauty of the trees, the beauty of families, the beauty of weather.It was far from my hostel but I kept dreaming for visiting it again during my trip, I didn't do but I'll absolutely come back one day."
17,4.0,"In 1988, Seoul held the summer Olympics and the Olympic Park was built for these games. The Olympic Park is a huge park and it is a joy to be in it. I found it to be a beautiful park. The park is divided into four zones namely for sports/recreation; arts and culture; environment; and history. The park has a walking trail along an ancient fortress. The arts and cultural part of the park has the SOMA Museum of Art. In the sculpture park, there are over 200 sculptures by different domestic and international artists. Apparently, the Olympic Park is one of the five top sculpture parks in the world. There are a number of sporting events that still take place for example the velodrome hosts cycling events. The Olympic Hall is now used for concerts. Well known artists like Mariah Carey have performed here.As you walk to the Peace Gate, there is a nice lake where you can see many different kinds of birds. The Peace Gate celebrates peace and harmony.There is also an Olympic Museum which houses many items relating to the Seoul Olympics and also other Olympics."
18,5.0,"This park is BEAUTIFUL! I went there on a sunny day, and there were a lot of elderlies came a long as well. Since I went on a Sunday, the park was full of families and couples who came for picnic. Also, it has bike rental for the public so that people can bike around the park rather than walking since it's a quite huge park. There are some peaks that people can actually hike and enjoy the view of the Olympic Park from the top. There are some museums and different stadiums in the park that people can visit if they are interested. Highly recommended for family, friends or couple outing."
19,5.0,"This was a wondeful experience. Absolute must see. The Olympic shrines,  the stadiums and the eternal flame. Also some beautiful nature here too. Right by the metro station. No excuses you must check it out. Not really a busy place so pjehty of space to walk and take pictures.I combined it with Lotte mall as it was about 1.5 km away so a simple walk"
20,4.0,"This park has lovely paths with shelter under trees. It is busy in places but it is soon easy to get away from them.This is a large area comprising lakes, paths and the remnants of the 1988 Olympics. The gold medal winners and many other important details of the Olympics are engraved in a large memorial in front of a big lake. However, many of the facilities are no more or are used for other purposes."
21,5.0,"Hi, I had a great time at Olympic Part last year. If you come to Korea in September, I am glad to introduce a great Korean traditional festival in Seoul in September. There will be a lot of things to see and experience, and you will get to know the Korean history enjoying the festival. It is HangSeong Baekje Cultural Festival! - When : Sep 21 ~ Sep 24, 2017 - Where : Olympic Park, Seoul, Korea - Theme of the Festival : Meet the King of Baekje in Seoul of 2,000 years agoThe Songpa area in Seoul was the ancient capital of the Baekje Kingdom for 500 years during the Hanseong Baekje Era (18 BC-AD 475) around 2,000 years ago. Songpa is also home to a number of time-honored historic and cultural heritage sites, including Pungnaptoseong Fortress and Mongchontoseong Fortress. The festival offers visitors a glimpse into the ancient history and culture of the Hanseong Baekje Period that brilliantly flourished based on a strong national power. You will enjoy the beautiful weather of fall in Seoul and feel the breath of Korean ancient dynasty, Baekje."
22,5.0,"This park is a MUST SEE for any tourist. The sculptures are beautiful and offer a huge variety to satisfy everyone's artistic tastes. The grounds are lovely and well-maintained. I didn't get to see the museums as they weren't open on a Monday but if the rest of the site is anything to go by, I'm sure they are great too! Awesome place!!!"
23,5.0,Very impressed layout. The amazing sculptures are worth visiting. The lake and its surrounds very photogenic.
24,4.0,"The Olympic Park is not far from the city centre and is readily accessible via the metro. The most striking part is the large concrete structure at the entrance. I went there in early April and the magnolia flowers were flourishing. The rest of the park seemed to be quite mundane. It is a very large park, good for a long walk."
25,5.0,This park is great. It is huge and the sculptures are unique and interesting. The park was busy with families playing with young children and riding bikes. Many people walking and running around the area. The place is well kept and I am glad that I came to explore
26,4.0,"The Admission: FREE AdmissionThe Park: This park is located in the center of Seoul and built for 1988 Olympics. There are over 200 sculptures on the lawn. Popular movie and TV commercial filming location. This place also has venue for concerts and sports event. There are museums and art galleries in the park too. The Location: Subway Line 5, Olympic Park Station. Exit 3"
27,4.0,"This park has many large grassplots to enjoy picnic. Please check some festival in this park if any - for example, Seoul Jazz Festival annualy."
28,4.0,"From time to time, I go to the park. This time, I found a nice temporary ice skating ground where all the kids are skating! Some of lovely couples are also enjoying their leisure time with love ones. It is extremely good price, admission is 2,000KRW(1.7 USD) and rental is 1,000KRW(80 cents) per 1 and 20 min session. There are intermission between sessions, this ticket allows only one session. Anyway it is just less than3 USD, kids can enjoy skating. There were lots of teenagers, couples, and parents who were watching & coaching their kids, That ground reminded me of my childhood when I skated on the wild field or on the Han River...Those times, the Han River used to be frozen... well, this skating place is seasonal and temporary for couple of months. I think it is better to go during weekdays than weekends, which is quite crowded. Even if the weather was quite cold, nobody cares about that because of fun!"
29,4.0,"Olympic park is located in the city. with the subway, exit 3 of Olympic Park Station, and you can see the monument of Olympic Park. but thats not the highlight, you need to walk behind the monument. there is a big lake and a beautiful road between trees. its really good to walk in the afternoon.."
30,4.0,"Huge place! Lots of families with kids. Coffee shops, resto, and small stores at the gate. Lovely trees and grass. On my way to swimming pool, (for half day admission 6,000 KRW, =about 6 USD, you can choose morning session or afternoon session), I could enjoy my walk from the station to the pool. Since this pool was used for the 1988 Olympic Games, quite fun to see the pool. If I had more energy, I wanted to take a seat and read a book under the nice weather. Entering grass is not allowed for the winter, as far as I know."
31,4.0,"Had visited here during night time. Well maintained. Enthusiasts do cycling, skating. I preferred to just walk down & enjoy."
32,4.0,"I arrived at the East Gate and was a bit surprised to see promotion for a concert series going on in one of the establishments. Walking for a bit I started to also see the several interesting and somewhat curious sculptures along with a map of the grounds. IF you just want to see the World Peace Gate then go to the West Gate and you are good. If you however want a wonderful walk alongside with interesting sights on your way - the East Gate is a good point. Along with the statues you can enjoy a peaceful walk with the locals going about their everyday activities. The closer I got to the West Gate I found, tucked away cutely, a wonderful small water mill and simply continued discovering the grounds. The World Peace Gate is naturally an interesting sight, but the park as total is what I recommend."
33,3.0,"The park is conveniently located near the Olympic Park Station on Line 5 of the Seoul Subway system or Mongchontoseong Station on Line 8.  I got off at the Olympic Park Station but would actually recommend going to the Mongchontoseong Station since it's near the World Peace Gate. That and several structures around it (place with all the flags) are the best photo opportunities.  It's basically a HUGE park, which isn't bad if you just want to relax and enjoy the scenery or get some exercise.  If you so choose, there are actually fitness machines that you can use at the park."
34,3.0,"It's a great park for a walk in the middle of the city, but not much more, Not many signs in English here, so I had some problems getting around or knowing what it was. On the positive side, it was surprisingly quiet and I was there on a Saturday in the summer. I had a long walk in a scenic place, but not much to do with the olympics. Some stadiums and other buildings are still in the area and there's a museum. It was a beautiful day, so I did not feel like spending the day inside and had a wonderful walk in the park. Plenty of paths and bike-paths. You can rent a bike there as well."
35,4.0,"This park is huge. It offers a good and free museum about the Baekje Kingdom, including a historical fortress wall walking trail (the wall itself is long gone). There are also interesting outdoor sculptures in the park and the park is part of a recommended hiking trail (which I didn't try) that goes on for several kilometers."
36,5.0,"great place to people watch, bike around, and read in the grass with friends on a blanket. little spots to get food as well."
37,4.0,Was able to see the peace gate only so I can't really what this olympic park has for visitors! But the peace gate was stunning!
38,4.0,"Olympic park is a very nice place to enjoy a relaxed walk or to go on a jog. Many locals also work out in the park on any of the many gym-like facilities available. Besides the nature one can also enjoy architecture of the stadiums that were build for the olympics in Seoul or visit one of the museums. It is also possible to rent bikes to tour the park. I went in winter and i think that the park will be a lot greener on summer, making it even more enjoyable!"
39,4.0,The Gymnastics arena was interesting to see as I've never been to an Olympic arena before. The show was excellent.
40,4.0,"This is not a bad place to drop by with the kids and family and have a grand day out! I highly recommend going on a weekday however to avoid a mass crowd of people though, but overall, its nice, spacious, and good for the kids to run around and have fun. Unfortunately they don't have kid play structures or something, but its not a bad place to take a bike or roller-blades around."
41,5.0,"I took one full day to walk through the Olympic Park (Infinity was slated to have their concert there and everywhere had their posters hang), then through to Seoul Baekje Museum which is located within the Park (very comfy place to visit and I even found a reading area where I promptly fell asleep). I finished my tour at the Park at Seoul Olympic Museum where a variety of sports history was showcased, including the national sport of Taekwondo. There is also a Starbucks outlet there at the Park near the walkway leading from the Subway station."
42,4.0,the park is huge and it's very well managed. always a joy to visit. real estate prices around the park have A LOT to do with this place. the coffee shop on the edge is pretty nice.
43,4.0,One of the must-see attractions at the park are the outdoor sculptures (including those at the SOMA Museum of Art) comprising more than 200 pieces from world-famous and rising artists.
44,4.0,"Beautiful park. Even while it was raining. Definately worth a trip. The old stadiums are still being used, apparently for concerts mostly. There is one construction site in the Park, but it still offers a lot of nice views. If you take the subway to get there you'll exit on a huge square where they still keep the Olympic fire burning."
45,5.0,"Very nice park, impressive the Peace Gate, pretty much still enjoyed by locals and tourists alike. Wotrh visiting, definitely."
46,5.0,"It is a really nice place where is so clean and warm , you can see many couples,old men or women,childern and dogs.Walking is a best activity there,although you can go hiking.Hope you can visit there with your lover."
47,4.0,When you walk out of the metro station the first thing you see is the massive beautiful Olympic Gate. The park is very clean.
48,4.0,"There's lot of acreage and many different stadiums, museums and walkways. It's certainly worth a visit, especially if there is a good exhibit at the SOMA museum. Be prepared for a lot of walking. The Peace Gate is near Exit #1 on the red subway line #8."
49,3.0,"Good that it put up some information about the Seoul Olympic game in the park, on the wall, on the floor."
50,4.0,I visited this park during the week and it was mostly empty. It was calm and beautiful and I loved it. It's well worth spending the time to walk around and explore. The main gate has some great monuments and shouldn't be missed.
51,5.0,"I can't speak highly enough about the Olympic Park. It is quite a sight when you exit the Monchongtoseong subway station and emerge up the steps to get your first glimpse of the majestic World Peace Gate, with the Olympic rings proudly displayed, and the surrounding colonnade of flags of all the countries that participated in the 1988 Olympics. I enjoyed spotting the flags of the many countries which no longer exist today and reading about the events of the 1988 Games on the long memorial beside the beautiful lake, which has lovely fountains that come on at the top of the hour. The extensive park is beautifully maintained and the Mongchon Fortress Promenade along the top of the ramparts of the ancient Mongchon fortress, which stood here hundreds of years ago, offers incredible views of Seoul in all directions and is a must-do. It was lovely to spend a few hours walking around the park, getting fresh air in the middle of a huge city, taking in the delightful gardens and visiting the many museums. The Olympic Museum and Baekje Museum are well worth a visit! I am not usually a fan of parks but the Seoul Olympic Park is one of the loveliest places I have ever visited overseas. Make sure you allow plenty of time for a lengthy visit to do it justice!"
52,5.0,"This is not your typical park.  You will have a difficult time if you try to see everything in one day.  I happened to benefit from viewing the Frida Kahlo exhibit at SOMA, which is very close to the Peace Memorial entrance.  Most museums are closed on Mondays, so having unexpected art moment really made my visit to this park special.  The sculpture garden is extensive--pictures do not do it justice.  There are tons of activities to engage in, hiking/hilly areas with stairs, meandering paths,...picnic areas...museums and various refreshment establishments.  I stayed in the park until closing.  You will not be disappointed with the time you spend at this park!"
53,4.0,There is an Olympic Museum with some history about the olympics in general and information about the Seoul Olympics. It is free and has an interactive exihbit for children. The grounds are beautiful and you can rent a bike or just stroll around.
54,5.0,"Lovely open space around all the Olympic stadiums.  Beautiful sculptures throughout the park and the Peace Gate is incredible, would definitely recommend a visit"
55,5.0,"Olympic Park in Seoul first hosted Asiad 1986 and then Summer Olympics in 1988. Since then it is open to public for recreation and exercise free of charge. Take subway line 5 to Olympic Park Station. Then you can walk on outer ring pathway and then the inner ring which is elevated on mounds. There are world class arenas and interesting sculptures all around. Olympic Park Gate is a beautiful sight. From June to August, it can be quite warm and humid, so do not forget to take eater along."
56,5.0,"Beautiful park with many trees, walking ways, many intenational sculpture works. Inside the park you can rest on the benches and eat some food at the cafe. Visit the museum of the 88 Seoul Olympic, too."
57,5.0,"I didn't have time to visit the museums there, but the park itself was beautiful and nice to walk around.  It's one of the places in Korea where you'll see random people coming together to knit around tree trunks.  You can rent bike carts too, but they take a lot of work.  Walking is more relaxing."
58,5.0,"I think this park is not a major attraction for tourist. However, this place is very good to have a leisure walk, and see more locals here. There are museums within this park, and you can learn about the kingdom prior to Joseon Dynasty (if you are into history)..."
59,4.0,"Being in the middle of winter, at first I didn't take to the park.  But like all Korean parks it has a lot to offer, and you need to spend time to find all the treasures.  I think it would be spectacular looking green and with filled lakes and streams in the other seasons.  There is art galore, wide open spaces, the majority of the Olymic venues, and even archeological digs.  I actually liked that several food chains were on site as I grabbed to go and had a picnic lunch.  You can hire bikes or go ice ice skating in winter.  I would recommend the fortress promenade, as you gain a great view around the area in a 360 degree panorama as you follow the path of the Mongchon Ramparts.  You can get to either end of the park on No 5 line (Olympic Park, venues) or No 8 Line (Mongchotoseong, world peace gate)."
