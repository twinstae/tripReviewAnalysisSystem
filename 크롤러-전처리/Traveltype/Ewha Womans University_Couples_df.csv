Nice relax ambience, nice shopping street, much less crowd so u could enjoy your walk & shopping more leisurely... simple & good food. Tried spicy pork rice burger, so tasty!The campus is nice to take photo. After Ehwa, walk down the street keep walking straight, u will find Sinchon station, another university street."
2,5.0,"A must visit attraction during autumn. The campus is lined with beautifully landscaped gardens and trees (along with yellow, fiery red and orange leaves( that is a sight to behold. The campus is basically a hive of activity with the tourists and students walking around this large and spacious campus.It is not necessary to walk the entire campus. It's good enough to capture the beauty of the campus just being hanging around the southern entrance of the campus.If you have time, the museum is a good place for a walk given that the exhibits also have explanations in English. We got quite a few nice little souvenirs as well from the museum gift shop for our friends."
3,5.0,Ewha Womans University is a must visit location. The university is very nice and very big campus. This place is rich in history.
4,5.0,"The university has an amazing architecture and landscape. Since this is a university, you will see students going in and out of their classes. Good thing they didn't mind us taking pictures inside the university.  Probably they are already used to tourists and even locals having photoshoots. Overall, enjoyed our visit here."
5,4.0,Wonderful campus worth a lot of pictures. Caffeteria is quite decent. A lot of walking and steps but worth the trip.Outside the main gate is a lot of shopping (Target audience is female university students) and food.

7,5.0,Beautiful place for photo taking.  A lot of street foods and shopping around.  Must visit this place if you like to take photos.
8,5.0,"Beautiful early American style buildings are hallmarks of this university ... full autumn leaves colors in well landscaped gardens add to a romantic feel that make the university feels like a park than a place of higher learning. With the young girls (woman university) patronizing the many small retails shops selling fashion accessories, clothings, shoes and food stalls immediately off the gates of the university, the whole atmosphere is one of youth, vibrancy and innocence.. a must visit place when visiting Seoul"
9,5.0,"We took subway line 2 to Ehwa Womans University using exit 2 (exit 3 can also be used) at the station with the same name. This is the largest university for women in Korea. It was an easy 5-10mins walk to the university. There is a cafe at the entrance and the grounds are nice. We went on a rainy day and the drizzle limited our walk around. Nevertheless, it was a nice area to explore."
10,4.0,I do so I thought the design was marvellous and made some great photographs. A massive escarpment beautifully lined. Within a 5 minute walk from the metro station of the same name. Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
11,4.0,"we stayed in Jongno gu, so we took Line 2 at Eurijo 3 ga to Ehwa station (only 10-15mins). we have spent 1hr in the univ campus, mostly due to the impression of the unique buildings.  then we wandered around for shopping and trying the local street food. This area is famous as a hangout spot, dynamic atmosphere and youthful culture. Lot of shops surrounding the univ, you could spend all day there if you are shopaholic. The price seems cheaper than other shopping area like Myeungdong or Insadong."
12,5.0,"What meant for students has started to gain popularity among foreigners. It was meant for students as they have little spending power but due to good products and reasonable price, it become popular with foreigners and now has been a tourist worthy visit place."
13,4.0,"Coincidentally pass by this uni when we walk around this area before check in hotel. We spend about half an hour here. We are here during spring season, but no chance to look for cherry blossom. And it's freezing cold when the day we at here. A lot of tourists visit to the campus.We only tour outside the campus. Take some landscape photos here. Many shops and cafeterias nearby the university. Good for shopping and eat."
14,4.0,"Visited this place cause it is a good option for early morning (since shops are still closed).  Quite a nice stroll with a European feel.  Convenient as it is near subway station and after the visit, the nearby shops are open so we can do some shopping as well."
15,5.0,The university is massive and have many unique buildings. Great place for photo taking. There is a garden in the middle for a great walk. Do take your time to climb the steps and have a great view at the university.
16,5.0,Most of cosmetics company that establish a cosmetic shop along the street near this university give a good bargain of cosmetics products. I prefer to shop cosmetics in this area rather than in Myeongdong. <3
17,3.0,"Many cheap and good shopping around the university.  Also, many cafes and restaurant which are reasonably priced."
18,3.0,We were at the Ewha Womans Fashion Street so we walked a little to this University to take photos.We heard this is one of the top uni in Korea. Looks ancient.If you have a chance just pop by and have a look.
19,4.0,"Great choice if you want to experience a youth type of activity as this is a place where there;s a need a long walk prior reaching the fascinating atmosphere of the university. Along the way you will bump in to different stores, street foods, coffee shops and mini attractions."
20,4.0,"Ehwa University is not too far away from Hongik University and they are served respectively by their own metro stations.  Whilst Hongik is grungy and organic, Ehwa has a feel of stateliness about it.  On top of the mound is the longstanding campus that's built by foreigners and it still proudly stands to these days, giving it a sense of tradition and history.  In actual fact, Ehwa University is one of the most elite female university in South Korea.  I truly wouldn't know how students there can concentrate in their studies noting that there are throngs of tourists that are taking selfies and wandering aimlessly around the campus the whole time.  The key part of this University will be the Red Sea parting looking architecture designed by Dominic Perault.  From afar, you look as if you are climbing the stairs that are flanked on both sides by rising waves.  When you get closer, you start noticing that the rising waves happened to be window opening of university campus that's built in accordance with the gradient of the mount.  It's cleverly done.  Naturally, where there are tourists, there would be shops selling duty free stuff, cafes and restaurants and there are oodles of them nearby.  Worth coming here for a look."
21,4.0,"In the three---month summer holiday, I take a visit to Seoul. And I also want to know more about the culture and study of different countries. The easiest way to know more about it is to get in the university to feel the atmosphere. So I take a visit to Ewha Womans University. We go there by subway. Actually, subway system is quite convenient for us to use. The surrounding of the university is also a commercial circle, like food stores, fashion shops and so on. I go shopping around the university with my friends firstly. The clothes are reasonable and fashion. You have a lot of choices. Then, we enter the university. The campus is really quite large. It also has many trees. This is what I enjoyed mostly. It is a nice place for people to take pictures. I advise those people who enjoy taking pictures need to have a schedule plan in order to arrange better time."
22,5.0,"The campus is beautiful! Great mixture of traditional european architecture with new, modern elements! Make sure to stroll around campus and just enjoy the view!Don't miss the art museum!! Right by the main entrance are a great number of stores, that will be every girls shopping dreams come true. Better hold on to your credit card ;)"
23,4.0,we walked outside the buildings and it was beautiful to take pictures. There is a kind of stately feel as you walked round the campus but it's not all buildings. There were trees and areas where you can sit around and enjoy the November cold. Good for photo-taking.
24,4.0,"during autumn , this place is really beautiful...add that with the youth energy from the students, its a wonderful place to visit. The architecture is beautiful!"
25,4.0,"You will find the goods/foods at this area is much cheaper compare to Myeong Dong and Dongdaemum.you may spend a days to walk, shopping and site seeing at this area."
26,4.0,I doubt most people go to see the campus. Despite the heavy rain we still managed to get in to admire the beautiful landscapes and campus layout. The highlight however is the cheap clothing along the alleys and backstreet. Upon leaving the subway station you see the main street. Go to the backstreet running parallel to it and you'll find many shops selling clothing at bargain prices. Then use the savings to buy yourself coffee at one of the numerous cafes.
27,5.0,"The pyramid looking building is as stunning as the pictures..which is the main reason people visit the University afterall. The surrounding area is small but charming, with a short little drag selling your usual cosmetics, clothes and some street food. There's also some cut cafes and restaurants down the slope infront of the Uni. There's this particular cosmetics store down there that sells goods for at least 40% cheaper than all the branded stores..DON't buy anything from there. It only welcomes tourists and for good reason! They either sell imitation Chinese products or stolen goods ;)"
28,4.0,"We were here for the campus centre by French architect, Dominique Perrault. Such a beautiful and brilliant design. Definitely worth visit!"
29,4.0,Large campus with modern design for some parts. You will also find a lot of shopping Streets very crowded in the afternoon.
30,4.0,"I gonna say their campus is so beautiful, a great place to take photo. we went in and had lunch at their food hall. there are shops in the campus as well. Be sure to check out the shopping area located right outside the uni."
31,4.0,This is an oldest woman's university in S. Korea.  The campus of this university is worth to visit especially in autumn time.  The buildings here are in classic style. Many tourist come here.  Recommend to visit during weekday.
32,4.0,"The architects have done a good job with this place. The main attraction is definitely the 'valley' which curves under and up again. The campus buildings are of note too - if you have time, do walk around. Head to the university streets for affordable goods thereafter."
33,3.0,The shopping street area is not big so can just spend some time here before moving on to those underground malls with equally cheap clothings. Came here just to check out the Uni..
34,5.0,"This is a resubmission with changes.  ID#: 378445951Take Subway Line 2 to Ewha Womans University station, exit 2 and walk a few minutes towards the campus. Stop at the Visitor Center on your right and learn about the history of the university and visit the gift shop where they have a very nice selection of items. Walk around the campus complex designed by the French architect that did the Pompidou Center in Paris. Make sure to stop at the Museum where you will find Korean paintings, ceramics, metal items and sometimes special displays. It is a museum where you can get a good view of Korean art in a pleasant atmosphere and in a short period of time. Outside the Museum there is now a trendy coffee shop. If you have time, walk on the streets outside the campus and you can find MANY cosmetic stores, clothing shops (note that they do not let you try on the clothes), shoe stores and the best bargain in Korea: socks for $1/pair (they make great gifts). In addition there are many inexpensive eating places--my favorite is Albab Restaurant (2nd street from the campus on the way to the subway), it has bibimbap for $4-$5 and many other dishes.If you go at night, the area is bustling with young people. The stores and eateries are opened well into the evening hours. This is a fun place to visit."
35,5.0,"We had some time to kill so we decided to visit this women only school. The school was founded by the missionaries in 1889 (?). Very nice job of landscaping here.. so beautiful. Buildings were all sitting on the hills, so there's some hiking to do get there. Once you are on the top of the hill (where ladies dormitory buildings are), you have a wonderful view of  Seoul's night lights, as well as the view of the Namsan Tower."
36,4.0,The architecture design of this building was unique and the landscape of the surrounding was very beautiful especially during spring which will be so colourfully.
37,4.0,A long history of looking down at women ended here and freedom and significance sprang out.  Buildings are nice and the new library is beautiful. Take time to walk around and learn the background and history of the place.  Worth the time if you are interested in a deep insight into Korea and it's history
38,5.0,"First women college in Korea. If you're a fan of running man, this is a must-visit-spot for you. Definitely worth a visit. All kind of foods available across the street as well."
39,4.0,"This is my 2nd visit to this lovely area. We were blessed with beautiful autumn leaves this trip.  We love this place because it has such a youthful atmosphere where shops and restaurants caters mainly for young adults. Ladies would love this place as fashion houses sells mainly ladies clothings and reasonably priced. The university's grounds is worth a visit and good photo shots can be captured. Before you leave, it is worth having a meal in one of the many restaurants here. The food is tasty and cheap.Recommended place to visit."
40,5.0,This universiity is well know for the elite Korean women. Nearby this place is good for shopping too.
41,5.0,"This is an easy walk from the subway, the surrounding open market for food and clothing items is interesting, and the campus is really excellent. The architecture of the central building is unique; we also toured the excellent museum which had an historic ceremonial gown exhibit as well as Joseon Dynasty porcelains. The English descriptions were highly informative. In November, when we were there, the Fall colors were still on the campus trees. We truly enjoyed walking around the campus enjoying the varied architecture and charming paths."
42,4.0,"Designed smartly, this campus is one of the most unique I've ever seen. During autumn and winter, tree leaves get red and yellow, making it perfect for shots. Around it, you may find lots of coffee shops, clothing * cosmetic shops for girls. Recommend for young couples."
43,4.0,I loved this campus. It's very beautiful. We spent quite some time just walking around and enjoying this very spacious and beautiful campus. They also had their own museum and church which anyone can visit for free.
44,4.0,This campus close to a bustling area of Seoul is impressive as far as its architecture is concerned. A high building with all student facilities is kind of burried on the ground. Have a look from Pera's Café.
45,4.0,"Don't really have anything specific to expect for a university. It turned out a nice place to walk around and enjoy the atmosphere and environment there. The famous wall at the entrance is good for photography. The design of the garden at the front entrance is nice. If time is right (for cherry blossom or red leaves), it should be a good place to visit again."
46,2.0,"This is 2 stops away from Hongik University. The University itself is ok, there is some good architecture, but around it the food is mainly bad cheap student food, unlike at Hongik. If you want really great food go one subway stop away to Sinchon."
47,5.0,"Surrounded by the most popular boutiques, restaurants and pubs in the city.  Proximity to three local universities makes it a great environment for young people on a budget but is the height of modern Korean fashion."
48,5.0,"We spent a morning visiting the campus of Ewha Women's University, mainly in and around the magnificent Dominique Perrault building which has become an icon of the campus, and at the University Art Museum.The Perrault building is a marvel of ingenious conception and design. It is stunning from the outside and has some fun surprises on the inside. The public can enter the building through doors 3 and 4 and explore the floor housing various dining facilities, the bookstore, the theater and other student services. You still get a good sense of the interior, even through you are only on one of its many floors.The art museum was exhibiting a special collection of porcelain as well as the regular collection. The docent, a junior at Ewha, spoke excellent English and was very helpful; she was a credit to her school. We enjoyed the welcoming atmosphere and the interesting collection.After our visit we walked around the fashion streets just outside the campus. This had the fun feel of a vibrant design scene."
49,4.0,A scenic and quaint university to stroll around after some crazy shopping in Ewha Downtown. But quite a bummer for banning visitors into the library.
50,3.0,"Many food stalls, shops and etc... A nice place to shop as well, not expensive. Clothes u see in Myeong-dong can be found here and is so much cheaper"
51,4.0,A lot of cheap shopping and korean made products for young females on nearby shopping streets! Ewha Womans University is also really beautiful; there are always many people visiting and taking photos
52,4.0,The University is beautiful and we just can't resist to take photos here. You may do your shopping here after visit the university.
53,5.0,Lotsa cheap stuffs to get from here. Lotsa eye candies too. The university is clean and students are well-mannered.
54,4.0,We were there near sunset and the architecture of the university reflecting the lights is amazing.  Didn't get to walk inside the buildings but it was just a nice one to walk pass by.
55,4.0,"much like Hongdae, since it's filled with university students (mainly female as it would appear), there's lots of affordable shops and snack vendors around, great place to grab some local treats! One of the main attraction will be the main building of Ewha Unniversity, it's two pavilions facing each other made out of glass. this is also why if you want to visit it, you should go during day time especially if you want to take some pictures, since at nighttime it's much harder to take pictures of these pretty glass buildings! the effect of the buildings create perfect symmetry and is pleasant for the eyes!"
56,4.0,Came here once during Nov during autumn - this place is scenic with autumn leaves turning reddish brown gold. Good place for photography. I'm impressed with the architecture of the university and also it's 'strategically' surrounded by shopping boutiques :D
57,5.0,"We were staying really close by this, and missed it for two days. So glad we finally discovered it (we could see it from our window in the 'Ever 8' hotel). Lovely grounds and buildings and an excellent introductory suite with films, information and very friendly staff."
58,5.0,"Close enough to Hongdae, the shopping stretch offers many shops along the street selling cosmetics and clothes. Prices were slightly cheaper than what we found in Myeongdong and more pleasant to walk around."
59,5.0,"Walked in just to tour around the area, and was immediately impressed. The view around the area was just so mesmerizing and beautiful, it'd be amazing to be able to study here."
60,4.0,"Went there with no expectation and turned out to be an exceptional delight.  Next to a youngster shopping area, the campus is well layout and maintained.  Lots of greens and extraordinary buildings, old and new.  And the cafeteria offers nice food (at least to tourist standard)."
61,4.0,"We did not visit the campus but concentrared on the shopping streets. There was definitely a lot of nice choises for women, a lot of girly stuff. So it is a bit different from other shopping areas in Soul."
62,5.0,"If you like architectural places, you must visit Ewha Womans University campus during your stay in Seoul. In the neighbourhood you can walk through nice Streets with shops and restaurants."
63,4.0,This university has a nice mix of old-world charm and very modern decor.  The library is a very nice mix of glass that is cut thru a large hill and encased in glass. Very nice architectural feet. Recommend checking it out if you're in the Shinchon area.
64,4.0,"This definitely somewhere to go if you want to do something slightly out of the norm. The museum is part of the huge EWHA complex and should be included as part of your visit to the whole area. The campus is definitely worth a walk around - beautifully sculptured gardens - amidst which are set some wonderful buildings. Check out that dug out hill within which are the class rooms! Surrounding the university are some lively young hangouts with shopping, bars and restaurants ... don't worry, we oldies did fit in. Within the museum (free admission) are displays of ceramics, metal & wood works, paintings and our favourite - the costumes. All round, a good day out"
65,5.0,"The concept of the building is like a Noah that split the red sea :)The surroundings area are absolutely amazing. It feels like european style in Asia city with greeneries and old fashion buildings.Easily reached by subway green line named Ewha University, take a short walk about 5-10 mins to reach this univ."
66,5.0,"I love this place! If you are not looking at designer items, this is exactly the place you will wanna end up to. Basically for ladies, you can get almost everything within 10,000 won excluding shoes and some other thick outerwear. If you are a fan of Migliore Myeongdong or Dongdaemun, I would advise you to buy it from Ewha, it's gonna be cheaper. For guys, it might be hard to look for shops but there are shops which offer 15,000 won for a decent long sleeve shirt. My boyfriend has bought several at Ewha. I think Hongdae might have more choices for guys, but the price might be a little bit more expensive too. There are a few cosmetic and skin care shops (those common ones such as Tony Moly etc etc), they are not as crowded as the shops located in Myeongdong, the staff paid better attention to you and personally, I feel that I have gotten better freebies as well. The food here are relatively cheaper as well when compared to other tourist attractions. Of course, you can tour around the pretty Ewha Uni too! It is a very beautiful place. Don't miss it if you are there."
67,4.0,"One of the places where you can find cheaper clothings, especially for youngsters. Shoes, accessories and cosmetics are the good buys that you can find around the area. The highlight of our trip was not so much on the shopping, but the beautiful campus. Coming from a city filled with concrete, the lush greenery of the campus, coupled with a mixed with modern and historical architecture was just simply impressive. For a moment, I thought that I am visiting a campus in London or Europe, and do make you want to be a student there! If you are taking a taxi to the area, tell the taxi driver ""E-dae"", which is a better-known name to the locals.

68,5.0,The whole area surrounding the university lined with shops and cafes/restaurants. the university compound itself is absolutely beautiful. definitely worth a visit!
69,4.0,"The streets leading the Ewha Womans University are worth a visit if you are a keen vintage shopper in Seoul. There are a number a good vintage shops in the back alleys parallel to the main street (pass the University Entrance). I was able to pick up items of clothing for both myself and my partner as there were also a good selection of male clothing in some of the stores. Most of the dresses, jackets, shoes and jewellery date from the 70s to 90s and they were really reasonably priced. There are also plenty of boutiques selling new but quite interesting fashion if you are not into vintage. You will get some bargains as the shops are mostly targeting students from the University so nothing will break your bank. The University itself is beautiful - there are lots of pretty gardens and lovely old buildings. It is open to the general public. Its a good spot for photos or bring your lunch and sit in the sun.Something else of interest is the ""wedding street"" - full of wedding vendors for any bride-to-be."
