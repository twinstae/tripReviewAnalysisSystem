0,3.0,"Visited on a weekday morning and it's not crowded. Abundance of stalls selling live seafood. The lady selling us the seafood was extremely friendly but the guy was quite arrogant! She also brought us to a small restaurant on another floor to prepare the seafood for us. The food preparation was fine but the charges just for the cooking was expensive. Overall, not really worth it."
1,5.0,"All fresh seafood are here . Not too expensive. And you can choose the restaurant for cooking upstairs . The price for cooking is also cheap . Very impressed . Some use English speaking, very easy to communicate"
2,3.0,"Went to Noryangjin fish market with my wife to treat ourselves to king crab. Managed to get a good price for 2.8kg crab ($180Aud), however, we were stung by the restaurant preparing our crab. First there was the serving fee ( which almost doubled in price because we didn't have soup), than the steaming fee for the crab (charged per kilo). What started up being a simple day of buying and eating fresh crab, ended being an expensive day at the restaurant, charging us approximately $60aud just to steam and serve our crab with a garnish of 4 pieces of lettuce, 1 chilli and 1 sliced fresh garlic. It's cheaper to go to a restaurant that has king crab and get them to prepare it.Btw, the crab was delicious. Meat was firm and sweet. Much better than buying the frozen crab legs."
3,5.0,"We went there after all what we heard and read about that place! We really enjoyed the evening! The food is super fresh and tasty. Picking such fresh fish isn't something you can do in many places around the world! Yes, it was pricy and yes they charge foreigners more and yes you have to negotiate the price but isn't this part of the fun ðŸ˜Š"
4,4.0,"A clean large fish market with a huge variety of fish and seafood. When you just buy as a final customer, it is really expensive. Busan is better in that respect."
5,5.0,Come here and view an auction or just walk around looking at the different selection. There are a couple of restaurants on the 2nd floor that will cook you any of the fish you buy. Food was fantastic and the experience was well worth the time
6,4.0,"Though not a ""fish person,"" I truly enjoyed visiting this market which offers numerous varieties of seafood not readily found in the US. There were huge shrimp/prawns/scallops, even larger crabs and lobsters, and vendors nimbly climbing on the tanks to retrieve product. We did not elect to eat at the market, but if one didn't want to ""chance"" a cooked-to-order overcharge, they could opt for a wide variety of offerings from the restaurants on the second floor."
7,5.0,I visited this place after watching multiple YouTube videos about it with my husband. This was a fascinating place to visit lots of weird and wonderful fish that you wonâ€™t find anywhere else in the world in a fish market. I recommend stopping if you are visiting Korea itâ€™s one of those once in a lifetime experiences that you wonâ€™t get back home if you are From a very western country The only complaint we had was trying to get a taxi out as none of the drivers speak English and they refuse to take you anywhere if they canâ€™t understand you. Taxi rank is hard to find due to construction
8,1.0,"Its a fish market so I am not sure if the management can actually improve it since there are so many vendors. To begin My tolerance level is quite high and i understand its a business, and business is tough. I get it. But after the experience today this place needs a review so that no one else should have to put up with this. This review is for stall #43 not the whole market itself.Now this is not the first time Ive been to this market. The first time was 2 years ago and the experience was fantastic (Old area). The second and also last time I will ever go again was today.We began doing our rounds asking for alaskan king crab prices since this was our priority item. Vendors were throwing out prices per kg left and right. All ranging from 70000 won to 80000 won. Okay we thought. First of all. Its market price and that fluctuates or maybe its not the right season etc. Whatever we just wanted some good crab. Eventually we came to a stall with 2 older ladies that spoke mandarin and gave a price at 65000 per kg. Sold. The lowest price so far and we were getting tired of browsing. First mistake.We ended up buying a whole alaskan king crab weighing 2.4kg at 156k won. They quickly grabbed one from the middle tank, weighed it and shoved it into a plastic bag. Second mistake.After we paid. A guy appeared and took us upstairs to a restaurant where they cooked it. Eventually the steamed crab and abalone arrives to our table, it was already cut since it was an option. Too messy to do it myself. Upon grabbing the largest leg. I realized something was off. Little to no meat, mushy and was sticking to the shell. I inspected all the other legs and found it to be all in same poor quality. Final thought the crab was not fresh. This was either a dead crab that was swapped during cooking or pre frozen. It cant be the same crab we bought 20 minutes ago. Then we realized we did not inspect the crab before they bagged it. Upon even further inspection we found one of the legs was also missing. This was the tipping point for us. We went back to the stall afterwards and feedback to the 2 ladies. Their reply was oh. The restaurant must of overcooked it.  Overcooked? This is a drastic difference in meat quality. It was literally mush. We also mentioned that it was missing a leg. ""Oh yeah the one you bought is incomplete. Thats why its so cheap at 65k. The complete ones are 90k won"" ...now you tell us this after we made the purchase. This type of business handling is street vendors looking to scam tourists. And I must admit. I was at the bad end today.So there are my 2 cents for this visit. I know there are honest vendors in the market. But after the experience today it just tainted what good it had going for it. Its a shame really."
9,1.0,It's just another fish market and nothing special about it. Some stall sellers will approach you but I think they are mostly China Chinese. I doubt the price will be good. I think you can spend half an hour there just to get a feel of the place.
10,2.0,"The old and the new fish market are right next to each other. Initially we walked through the old one first from the subway to get to the new one. I had learnt that some vendors decided to not move to the new building, so the new fish market was quite awkwardly empty in such a huge space."
11,4.0,"Nice place to visit if you want to see all possible things that live in the world ocean.You can buy directly from the market and go at the 5th floor of the next building and prepare it. Recommend, nice experiwnce"
12,4.0,"Enjoyed seeing all the different types of seafood available at both the old and new fish markets.  Our guide and host Taein  knew his way around the markets.  He selected very fresh fish and octopus, which was cut into sashimi and  sushi and also a fish stew.Delicious!  I recommend this air bnb experience to get the most out of your market tour."
13,3.0,"This so called traditional fish market, apparently due to its popularity and inflow of tourists, is not so ""traditional"" anymore. Though open for 24 hours, we went there during night time, most of the stalls closed and limited seafood available, most of the stalls selling the same range of seafood. I would rather go to a better restaurant with the same price."
14,4.0,This was our second visit and we can without doubt say this is one of our favorite fish markets in the world.  Itâ€™s not huge and you donâ€™t need a guide.  Some markets people donâ€™t want you to take pictures of their items but vendors here are very friendly -just asks first.  They will even hold up items and pose for your photos.  The best part about this place is buying the extremely fresh seafood and heading straight to one of the adjacent restaurants ( if youâ€™re not sure where to go the vendors will hook you up with someone who will walk you there.  Donâ€™t worry.  Itâ€™s not a trap).  At the restaurant enjoy your purchases along side a bunch of soju like a local.
15,3.0,"we visited this market (old&new) around noon, and it was empty, a few customers. We did not buy anything from the market, but had lunch at a sushi restaurant on the second floor in the new market. Food was good and price was reasonable.Fish market was okay...no action and kind of boring..sorry..."
16,5.0,"There is an old building and a new building next to each other. We first walked round the old building which is just one level and saw all kinds of seafood products, many of them still alive. Afterwards we entered the new 3 storey building and saw more of the same. The market sells about 150 tons of seafood a day. You van purchase the seafood from the vendors and take it upstairs to the restaurants who will cook it the way you want and add side dishes (for a price). There is also an area where they sell dried marine products but the whole fish market was one of the highlights in Seoul."
17,5.0,Has our lunch here. The seafood is nice and sweet with simply cooking. Order king crab and use go fried rice is awesome. Remember to bargain the price
18,4.0,"Fresh seafood to choose from, then choose your cooking style. Consists of the old and new market. I recommend the new market and select your seafood from the second floor (more selections at individual stalls allowing for better pricing).  Then to the restaurant to cook. We checked out the restaurants first, found the one we liked and they escorted us to the seafood stall to select. Not cheap but good and fresh and reasonable."
19,1.0,"If you want to visit and eat in this place keep in mind our experience:1 In this place no one speaks English so misunderstandings will be at any time...2 We bought 16 pieces between shrimps, clams and oysters for W 25,000, after that, they guided us to another place where the fish will be cooked (a not so nice and neglected place) where a woman asked us how to cook the fish (try to imagine how to comunicate with no english.... ), **We never asked about the cost thinking that cooking will be less expensive than buying the fish (our mistake***)  finally when whe ask for the account, the woman asks for W27,000 and then we said if the fish were already paid, why the amount? the woman did more than 3 times the sum trying to justify the W27,000 including things like cover for two persons... so please first ask if the amount is by piece or by weight (kilos), Just take care!"
20,3.0,Expensive but not much variety. Similar seafoods from each vendor. Poor environment but seafood is fresh.
21,4.0,"Worth a visit, you have to cross the bridge above the subway, first you will find outdoor stands but I think indoor stands provide better quality and cheaper prices, so go straight to the building after.Enjoy 6 oyster at a price of 5000kwr or big clams which cost 5000 per piece"
22,5.0,A large platter of assorted sashimi' a dozen fresh oysters steamed' octopus sashimi still alive' sea squirt (something truly unique) a lobster from live to sashimi tail and remains simply steamed' and the grand treat for this lunch a whole king crab simply steamed 100% amazing' the whole meal costing little over 200 dollar how could you complain ' head for stall 16 at the second floor' for all you seafood to be cooked' love this place we shall return one day soon and bring the kids along amazing place for the whole family l!
23,5.0,"I bought the seafood from the 1st floor and they introduce me with the restaurant on the 2nd floor. There are 2 type of charges, 1st they charge based on how many person who come to eat. 5,000 won/pax and 2nd they charged for the cooking fee. They also can speak chinese very well."
24,5.0,"Although i'm not a fan of fish, my visit at Noryangjin Fish Market was great. Easy to find and access with the public transportation, you will find all kind of fish you can ever imagine.On top of that, you can chose some fresh fish from the fisherman and get it to a local ""restaurant"" on site.  I had the best salmon and tuna sashimi ever.I think i got to pay a bit too much for it (Thanks for being a foreigner) but totally worth it.At the local restaurant there, what a great service and the staff is cool. Although the english is limited, you can easily manage your way around."
25,4.0,"It is a  fish market in a huge complex (several floors) housing more than few thousands shops.  You can get everything which lives in water.  You can bye and take the stuff on the top floor which is lined with several restaurants.  They will cook for you for some charges.  So, visit during lunch or dinner.  And if you want to see the actual local flavor, visit the market early morning (1.00 a.m.) when auction is held.  Metro: Noryangjin (Line 1) exit 1 or 8 (not far from Seoul Railway Station)."
26,4.0,"Noryangjin market is a definite place that you should come to if you are looking for a large size King Crab meal.Getting to this location is best by the subway, rather than taxi - during dinner time, the traffic was horrible and i had a pounding headache at the end of the taxi journey.lots of stalls selling King Crabs with various owners telling you why their crabs are better. You definitely need to bargain, do not be afraid to make a low bid, if the stall is sticky on the price, get them to give other freebies like clams, prawns, or abalones etcwe order also abalones, clams, prawns & sashimi. my verdict is that other than the King Crabs, the rest of the fare are simply average.after you order the food, it is passed over to another representative from a shop that will cook the crab for you. They charge a fee for the cooking and steam is the best way to have the crab IMO."
27,3.0,There is a new and old market. The new one is cleaner and doesn't smell as much as the old one. Bought the seafood from the new place and bring it up to 2nd floor for them to cook. There's a lot of restaurants to choose from and prices are similar. But it is not cheap to eat there. Buying the seafood is already pricey enough. Letting them cook is expensive too. The charges are depending on what type of method you want them to cook. Total bill comes out to over $100 for 2 of us when we did not even order alot. I think eating out will be cheaper than this. I think there are more locals going there to buy the seafood to cook at home rather than asking the restaurants to cook. They charge a $5 USD for individual seating. The restaurant did recommend what type of style to go with the type of seafood but seems like everything they say best fit is grilled.Just an experience but probably not worth going again.
28,5.0,"Loads of fresh seafood here. Had the king crab and abalones. Be wary of the prices as you will need to negotiate here.King crab costs about KRW 90,000 for 2kg+ crab.KRW 10,000 for 3 abalone."
29,3.0,"We skipped breakfast to visit this market for branch. The market is situated in a large building right next to the Noryangjin metro station. Once inside, the large building has a mezzanine floor for restaurants, and the main floor was just for selling tons and tons of seafood. Once you have picked them, you could bring them to the restaurants to cook for a fee. And so we walked around to pick some seafood, when up to a restaurant recommended by one of the seafood counter-owners. The different seafood we bought were obviously ok because they were all fresh, and we actually had lobster sashimi for breakfast! However, prices were not cheap, so donâ€™t expect too much -- just tread it as a place to go for a walk and a bite."
30,5.0,"People are saying it is expensive but I think for this quality and choice and freshness it is not at all! Close to the metro station which is very handy. You can buy fres fish - fresh means alive an restaurants will prepare it for you - you can say barbecue and will know how to do it, we have bought f;at fish and giant claims (do not know the names) and it was delicious, do not forget soju:)I would advice to visit the ground floor first and after the first floor which is more lat is say modern."
31,3.0,"We visited the Noryangjin Fish Markets today, free to get in and walk around.Loads and loads of different stores all selling much the same seafood.You will get harassed/approached by lots of the staff as you stroll through each isle.So many fish, crabs, lobster, prawns etc.Given the language barrier a little hard to ascertain the exact price.  We did end up having a conversation in chinese (through my partner) and were advised you buy the seafood, take it upstairs to a restaurant who charges you $30,000 won to sit in the restaurant and then you pay a per kilo cooking fee.  We opted out as it was too hard to work out watch you would actually pay although the seafood all looked great.Well worth the visit."
32,1.0,"Direction: Noryangjin Station Exit 7 walk straight and uturn to an underground tunnel and you will see the new market. I have been here twice. The old one and the new one. You really have to shop around and check out the price per kg etc. Once you see the stall with the reasonable prices, get them to weigh every seafood and record the weight.* After that don't follow the runner. I got overcharged for the cooking fee at a restaurant named dragon head or something operating by some Chinese. 7,000 and/or 10,000 won per kg. Immediate regret. It has free wifi though. Walk around on the upper floors and ask the price. Not worth your time unless you have time to spare and you wanna eat live abalone. Go to the old market. I will never come back again. It is really a ripoff."
33,3.0,"Big seafood market. Note there are two markets, one which is older and one new.If you buy any of the seafood, you can bring them to the first floor of the new market and go into one of the resturants and get them to cook for you.Warning : getting the resturants to cook is not cheap but maybe we were ripped off. There are two of us and we paid 30, 000 won for the resturant to cook for us , mind you cooked only two steak salmon!!!"
34,1.0,"I love the shasimi, worth the price. And really fresh as if you enjoy drink ( alcohol). You should have to enjoy with shake. Highly recommend. Go Go Go"
35,1.0,"We  went there following the suggestion of the lonely planet guide and we were incredibly disappointed. It is basically a huge smelly fish market where you can buy and have cooked your own food. (Quite hard to buy it due the very poor English spoken in the market). However we managed and we spent about 30 Euro for some fish( some prawns and clams). Then they bring you upstairs where a ""restaurant"" will cook for you the fish. Basically for doing some bbq and a small soup we paid over 30 euro. Considering that we were brining our own fish, I found this incredible. Plus it wasn't that good.I would strongly recommend to not waste your time and money there. There are several places in Seoul where you can eat better and spend less."
36,4.0,"This place has a lot of seafood that you can probably find near your hotel, but the experience of walking past these stalls is quite an experience. We chose a plate full of sashimi after making several rounds over and over again. We tried to pick a place that didn't have overcrowded tanks and dead fish floating inside (not a good sign).  Once we picked our plate of sashimi for $20,000 won (we didn't bother to haggle but you can), we paid and they led us upstairs to a restaurant. The chopsticks and spoons are inside the side drawer of the table you are sitting at. It should be the drawer facing the aisle.We ordered Makouli (Korean alcohol) and at checkout (you pay at the register) it was $10,000 won which we thought was very pricey for 1 Makouli bottle since it's super cheap at any 7-11 or convenience store. Great experience but wouldn't order alcohol again."
37,2.0,We decided to give this place a go despite reading bad reviews and they were right. It is a tourist trap so unless you plan to buy and cook your own food give it a miss. You get to see some fresh seafood but it gets repetitive. They will push you to buy fresh seafood and will bring you to a bunch of restaurants upstairs and charge you exorbitantly to cook it. Worst meal we had in Seoul. And it costs an arm and a leg. Many better markets around the world. Don't waste your time. Go to a pub and have a beer instead...
38,4.0,"Wow any kind color of fish, she'll fish, lobster and crabs. Live fish and prepared fish. Very friendly trying to sell you must be careful cars trucks motorcycle everywhere."
39,4.0,"From the 66 building, this is only a mile or two to drive. Price is ok, if you came from North America. Very clean and no smell foul that you normally have in a wet market. Ocean products comes in different varieties of types and sizes. You have options on the restaurants that prepare the food. You can do traditional sitting, low table(cross-leg) or with the standard chair and table. We did the traditional settings and I did survived the cross legged for an hour. A very good experience and a must see. You should be able to speak korean or have a good tour guide in buying and preparing the food. Excellent food."
40,4.0,"we got here very early in the morning and the place was packed. What's different about this market is that it has an enormous amount of fish tanks. What you may not like is seeing alive and dead fish in the same tank but to me it beats seeing live fish on a tray with no water and they're gasping for air. The selection of mussels, small and large fish, crabs, etc. is pretty incredible. You can take an escalator and see things from above to get a better view. It wasn't overly smelly there. Been to many where the stench was overbearing."
41,5.0,This place is highly recommended for all tourists! The seafood was fresh and fantastic! The price was very reasonable too. There are 3 restaurants around that will cook your seafood buys for you. Will definitely come back again!
42,5.0,"We actually visited both old and new market but decided for the new for hygiene sake. It's definitely worthwhile to get your hands on to the king crab that you will never able to get in SG for $120, at 2.2Kg! We also got ourselves a big plate of fresh salmon at $12 and 2 tiger prawns and 4 small abalones for $24! Tell me now, where to get? But do note that buying of the seafood and the restaurant fees are different. Thus you will need to pay extra cooking fee when you eat in-house at level 2."
43,4.0,"Went to Noryangjin twice and bought scallops, prawns, salmon sashimi, oysters, king crab, abalones and octopus. Each time, it cost us about 50,000 won. On both occasions, we went to the same restaurant on level 2 which charged us 25,000 won with soju included. Great price for super fresh seafood! Would go back again in future!"
44,4.0,"Not saying they are the most honest people on earth but please do not be put off by bad comments. After reading the reviews, I nearly gave this place a miss but thankfully I didn't. Most commented about how they feel cheated about the food preparation cost. I felt that way initially but when I questioned the cost (with my limited Korean), I began to understand how it works. So the usual 5000won or so includes the side dishes, drinks and the provision of a place for you to eat. If you need then to cook season, the extra cost will depend on the amount of cooking required. So the more cooking or preparation you required for your food, you will pay more. The culinary skills does leave much to be desired. BUT since I was there for LIVE seafood, what better way than sashimi or steaming it. The natural sweetness of the fresh seafood is to die for!Expensive? Perspective here please. Needs some bargaining but it's not crazy. Most shops quoted me within a certain range. Standard prices for 4small abalones - 10,000won. Bought a king crab for 75,000won and got the lady to throw in some raw baby octopus. Found out that I probably overpaid for the crab and went back another day. The shop owner recognized me immediately and I told her to give me a discount because I overpaid the last time. No questions asked, 65,000 (approx 65usd) for a much much bigger king crab this time. And she threw in more baby octopus this time. The crab would probably cost 3 times here in Singapore so I'm not complaining. Then again, things are always so expensive here in Singapore so... it's really where you come from and the value you see in the seafood. Try it for yourself."
45,1.0,"We visited Noryangjin Fish market in Oct.2016. We purchased some seafood down stairs and they took us upstairs to eat. We were told the table charge won 5,000 (about $5) per person, about total won 10,000 (about $10) But the price raised to won 24,000 (about $24) when we sat on the table.I heard so much about this place.But, very disappointed as we visited after we saw and heard about this place.I will not recommend this place to any of my friends!!!"
46,4.0,"Worth the experience. Take exit 7 from the metro then take a right under the tunnel full of fresh veggies. The indoor seafood market is cleaner and simple to navigate. There will be english speaking guides, or yellow shirts, who can translate for the seller. They will also direct you to the 2nd floor to the restaurant.It will be a little pricey, since the fishmonger has their own set prices which you may choose to negotiate. Additionally, the upstairs restaurants will charge their standard prices. Cass goes so well with the food though.I lived in Seoul for a year before coming here, and I can say this place is not very tourist-y compared to some of the other attractions the city offers."
47,4.0,"I was hesitant to come here after reading all the negative reviews here on TripAdvisor.After experiencing it ourselves, it really was nowhere near as bad as all the complaints here.I mean, sure it smell like fish, after all it is a fish market, of course it's not going to smell like perfume.We had a local food tour guide who knows her way around and we had one of the best seafood we ever had here.The live octopus dipped in sesame oil and salt was great, also the steam giant crab was fantastic.Basically everything we had here was great, even the kimchi side was so tasty.The vendor here mostly don't speak english but some able to speak mandarin due to the many chinese tourist who likes to come here.I would recommend to travel here with a local korean or a specialty food tour guide to make your experience more comfortable.There were two separate market at the time we came, the new one and the old one. The newer building seems cleaner and nicer, but I honestly think they are not that much different."
48,4.0,"There is soooo much fresh seafood at the market.  It is a large market.  As a tourist, chances are, you aren't going to buy seafood to take home or cook yourself.  There are several restaurants that you can buy seafood at the market and they will cook it for you.  The only problem is choosing the right restaurant.  Be careful of the different charges for cooking.  Most the restaurants charge the same.  The hard part is figuring out which one will cook it best.  We chose wrong, but I'm sure there are some good restaurants upstairs in the market.  I think there were about 20 to choose from.  For me it was just fun to see the market."
49,3.0,"Live King crabs, lobsters, uni and more. Perfect for buying to cook it yourself but do not eat it there! They will charge various fees for cooking/seating and even after you agreed on a price, they will ask for extra fees. Also they simply don't know how to cook the foods; tough overcooked meat. We went 2 times to different restaurants and got cheated both times - even the lobster tail mysteriously disappeared and they insisted all the meat was served already, to top it off an extra $30 for.. boiling it."
50,4.0,Itâ€™s a 5 minute walk from the metro We toured the old and the newThe new is definitely more cleanEvery stall holder wants you sell you something. Its Ok Its just like every other market in Asia.My wife wanted something special it was our anniversary so we chose king crab. It was around 2 kilos and cost won 50k with won 20k for cookingWe followed a runner upstairs to a small very clean restaurant area where the crab was cooked beautifully. I donâ€™t complain about the price. I just let you know about my great seafood experienceI will recommend to all my friends to visit this market for the experience
51,4.0,"This place is very cool and definitely a must-see in Seoul. We went on a Tuesday for lunch and it was almost empty. First, figure out what you want - we wanted king crab. Walk around and get prices from a few different vendors and figure out who has the lowest. Once we had a vendor picked out, we negotiated and got out crab for about $50 bucks. Then you go upstairs and find a restaurant and they will steam it for you. We also negotiated up there - just ask a few places for prices and see who is the cheapest. Overall, fun experience and the King crab was amazing!"
52,3.0,"it was quite confusing as this was our first time, you basically choose your seafood someone helped us choose and translate and lead us to upstairs to a restaurant and they cook it but you have to pay a fee for it."
53,4.0,"Interesting place though less rowdy than Tokyo's Tsukiji Fish Market. We chose a lobster, crab and sea urchin for only 54,000w. The stall vendor whisked us away to a nearby restaurant that helped us prepare the freshest seafood ever!"
54,5.0,"It's a cool place to walk through. Hard to purchase without translator, we got lobster and crab and had them cooked upstairs."
55,2.0,"It's a big market where a lot of vendors are selling quite a few but limited types of seafood. However, if you have been to other fish markets around the world or any big wet market, you will be disappointed with this market.1) it's really hard to find it from the train station, and there's nothing else to visit near the fish market;2) it's too old and dirty to be a tourist destination;3) the worst part is the communication: if you don't speak Korean, you even cannot ask/confirm the name of the seafood, negotiate the price or ask around to know the fair price. The aunties there speak zero English and are not very good at using body language or other tools to communicate. I got my seafood from a Mandarin-speaking auntie. I knew I got ripped-off, but there are not many aunties who can speak Mandarin, so I didn't have a choice.4) the octopus sashimi wasn't good or special either. I still prefer the Japanese wasabi octopus.5) when we brought the seafood to cook in a restaurant, we faced the communication issue again. We couldn't even describe how we wanted the seafood to be cooked. They didn't provide menu/pictures either."
56,4.0,"We bought a whole lobster & snow crab in the concrete building of the Noryanjin fish market, even though there are 3 buildings that make up the market. We found the concrete building setting the newest and cleanest of the 3. We found a vendor selling lobster & crab, pointed to each type & asked how much. They charged 120,000. Korean won which is $101. BEFORE we made our seafood purchase, we asked where we could get it cooked for our lunch. They walked us over to another building closeby with people seated inside at low tables. They all had rice, Kim Chee & were eating seafood. Apparently after purchasing your seafood, you take it there & they steam it & bring it to your table. So we bought our seafood which turned out to be a kilo or 2.2# EACH of lobster & crab!! You pay the restaurant after you eat, for cooking your seafood, rice, water & Kim chee.MMMMMM It arrived steaming hot, simply placed in a huge aluminum pan cooked to bright orange perfection. They gave us 2 pairs of scissors, rice bowls, water & Kim chee. We LOVED it...so much fun & good eats........the lobster was the best...SOOOO  MUCH MEAT...not just a small tail or teeny claws, HANDFULS of lobster! We left wth full tummies & intentions to return on our next trip!"
57,3.0,"A friend recommended we visit. You can buy some fresh seafood and they can bring you to a restaurant in which they will prepare the seafood for your consumption. I would suggest you check what season it is for which seafood. Or safest to buy something that you see at every stall as that is probably the season. We bought some clams, and although they were in water, they are not fresh. Bought some urchin, only one stall sells them, and we left that whole bunch alone as it looms rotten. The person who prepare the food said if the clams were cooked, it's ok to eat. But if eaten raw , we will sure get tummy aches as they were not fresh! If you want to be very safe, just buy a crab or a live fish."
58,3.0,"This is a working market and while it may not be a pleasant tourist place, don't be turned off. Yes the floors are wet and dirty, and the seafood may not be the cheap. But it's fresh and once you've picked what you like, there are little restaurants that can cook it the way you want (grilled, BBQ, steamed etc). We paid 98000 wons for an Alaskan king crab (1.7kg), 10000 wons for 4 small abalones and 10000 for 5 fresh scallops. We paid the restaurant 33000 wons to have everything prepared and cooked. It was fresh and yummy so don't be put off by what you initially see (like I did)"
59,4.0,"Really impressive arriving by subway to this fabulous market.You don't have to speak Korean, international languages work !They speak a bit English and Mandarin.Food is fresh and it is so typical !"
60,5.0,"Amazing place. Hundreds of shops, all selling fish of course. Many boast incredible aquariums containg live fish, squid, u name it. Lots of sea food as well. I liked it very much."
61,4.0,"We went in the morning when there was a lot of hustle and bustle. The stalls all had excellent ware, some focusing on shellfish and others focusing on fish. The fishmongers tend to give a higher price to tourists however it appeared they were waiting to haggle so we did. Really"
62,4.0,Skeptical about eating here since there were a number of tourists complaining that they were overcharged. Thus extra homework was done prior to the visit.  Had my price list as well as the items i wanted to eat Oysters 12 for 5000won tiger prawns 15 for 10000won  Buy your choice
63,5.0,"Absolutely love this place. Price point aside, I has the most amazing seafood here. Fresh and super sweet king crab, scallops etc It's definitely not cheap but I guess seafood is always on the pricier side and here you'll find it better priced that those you get in restaurants. "
64,1.0,"This place is completely not worth it. Compared to fish markets around the world with Japan the nearest this is nowhere. It is a straight tourist pitfall. The stalls keepers are not the owners, they are hired as sales people due to language reasons and to ofter you extremely low"
65,4.0,"Alight at Noryangjin Station, use Exit 1 and walk straight (short distance) till you see an underpass on the right. Go through this underpass and turn right upon exit. Follow the crowd (or fishy smell) and you will arrive at this seafood heaven! Some prices fluctuate between stalls, so best to walk around and ask before selecting on one to buy your fresh seafood! Oysters seem to be sold at flat 5000won, while items like lobster could range between 25,000 to 50,000 per kg (depending on stall owner).Bring your purchases up to second floor and have a restaurant cook them eg steam. Had mine done for 7000won per item, 3000won per pax for table seat. Overall a nice experience if you ensure not to get ripped off !"
66,5.0,"It is simply the biggest fish market in Seoul. Getting off at the station, just follow your nose and follow the walkway across the tracks. Enter from the riod is easiest if you come by train.Inside you'll find a profusion if small stalls with an overwhelming selection of live, and otherwise, fish. If you wast to eat on location, it works like this: You choose your favorite fish and they will make sashimi directly in the front of you. You can of course take the sashimi home or, more interesting, take a receipt  and go to a restaurant on the second floor of the fish market. They will charge you a bit of table fee and charge for the cooking, collect your fish and serve it. You xan also get a nice hot soup from the fish bones, in addition to the sashimi.All in all, a fun way to have a very koeean lunch!"
67,5.0,"It's not hard to find. Go to the Noryangjin subway station and follow the signs. You walk on a sky bridge over the road to get there. You will be able to smell it when you get close to the building. Walk down the stairs until you reach ground level and there you are. Sea creatures as far as the eye can see. Shop keepers are really friendly, even to foreigners. They really try to entice you to buy. Don't know how well they understand English because as soon as they saw my boyfriend, they started talking to him in Mandarin. Wouldn't hurt to know the Korean word for what you plan to buy, but you could also just point. They'll show you the price on a calculator. A lot of things like fish, crab, and lobster are priced based on weight. Other things like shrimp have a fixed price. If you buy a lot from one place they are more likely to give you a discount or some extra stuff. If you buy fish they'll clean and cut it for you on the spot. The shop keepers are partnered with a restaurant nearby and they take you and everything you bought there to be cooked however you want it. We got some sort of black fish (boyfriend didn't know the English name for it) which we ate as sashimi. The head and the bones we had cooked as a soup. We also got our shrimp steamed. And you HAVE TO TRY the live octopus. Just do it. It's cheap and really not bad. They'll cut it up for you and you can take videos of it moving. I thought it was fun. All in all it's really fresh and really cheap seafood. Coming from America, the prices here at Noryangjin are a steal. Really worth the experience. They'll have any kind of seafood you can think of. Go! Go! Go!"
68,3.0,"not the usual tourist destination in seoul but would be a great adventure to those who are into fresh seafoods especially king crabs.  go to noryangin subway station by either line 1 or 9. take exit one and walk about 100 meters.   it was past seven pm when we arrived and the fish market was a bit quite.   it took courage to walk pass by the sellers which i felt were a bit aggressive.  we went up a building located on one side of the market and just followed some chinese tourists, as if we were part of their group.   on the second floor are a series of restaurants and we went to one which looked a bit humble with a sign that says ""we serve to tourists.""   we were quoted 60,000 kwn for one kilo of king crab.  minimum of two kilos per order which represents the weight of one crab.  so thinking it cheap, the two of us feasted on it.    coming back home, i was able to read the reviews of the place and felt my stomach churning.    wow,  you guys were able to have king crabs for only 30,000 kwn!!!   that is only half of what we paid : ("
69,4.0,"The fish market is huge. You can see a lot of different seafood which is not easily seen in other places, prawns as large as a lobster, and lobsters which are 2-3 times bigger than the lobsters commonly seen elsewhere, different kinds of shellfish etc. You can buy the seafood and the stalls are usually linked to small restaurants which would cook the seafood for you for a fee. Not extremely cheap but the seafood is really good and of course super fresh. If you can speak mandarin, there would be absolutely no problem communicating with the sellers."
70,3.0,"Ww decided to give this place a visit after reading so much about Noryangjin. Well, the range was well covered & the prices of the fresh seafoods were acceptable. Abalone costing 10,000â‚© for three & scallops too. We bought six types of seafood and were later brought to the restaurant to have it cooked. The seafood was satisfactory except for the prawns which we felt it was not fresh though. What shocked us was the cooking fees when we were asked to pay for 90,000â‚©. Thought it was rather overpriced but we did enjoy the experience though. So please try to limit the type of seafoods so as to reduce the cooking charges."
71,5.0,"This is a great place, I highly recommend coming here for a meal. The market is very clean, well organised and very reasonably priced. You can buy your fresh lobster, fish, octopus, abalone, sea urchin etc. from the stalls, take them to the restaurants on the 2nd floor and they'll BBQ, sashimi or steam it for you - delicious! Super fresh!"
72,5.0,"Don't let the scent of fish deter you from the place - it is an absolute must go if you're in Seoul! This was honestly the highlight of my  entire trip to Korea. We took a subway here and the fish market was a little bit hidden to say the least. Walked down a couple flights of stairs and lo and behold - aisles and aisles of fresh seafood everywhere!!! We browsed around for about 15 mins before finally stopping at a stand and selecting our fresh octopuses and fish. The lady asked how we would like it cooked and we asked for our octopus to be raw and for our fish to be grilled. After she pulled them from the tank, she gave them to the people in the back to slice up for us. Then, they had us follow a gentleman behind this alleyway up to their kitchen. It was the coolest concept ever. Super authentic. You go and remove your shoes and sit on the floor on lowered tables to eat. I tried my raw squirming octopus tentacles for the first time and it was such a unique experience! Yummy! My boyfriend and I were so excited to be able to visit this place!"
73,4.0,"If you love seafood, this is a must! I was skeptical at first, having been to fish/seafood markets in various parts of the world including the much acclaimed Japan. The seafood market is accessible across the bridge from the subway station from our hotel. Language is not a problem if you do not speak Korean as there are vendors who speak mandarin. The vendors are enterprising and friendly in general. It may be a little challenging if you are a solo traveller as the portions cater to 2 or more persons. We bought abalone, clams, live octopus etc. and enjoyed the meal upstairs - sashimi and BBQ. Our friendly neighbours offered us seafood soup and king crab. Yummy! The live octopus was an experience!  The tentacles were still moving, but it's fun. Make sure your socks do not have holes as you will be sitting on the floor. I prefer this market to the Jagalchi Market in Busan, where I was travelling alone. It's easier if you share the food. More variety at the Noryangjin Fish Market. Pricewise - reasonable; one goes more for the experience."
74,4.0,"Impressive fish market. But what can you do with fresh fish in your hotel room? Ok for sushi and sashimi, but what about king crab, tuna and lobster? Well, there are several small restaurants upstairs, where you can choose from this panoply on offer ..."
75,2.0,"It was a wet market, so wear covered shoes. It was slightly awful to see some dead fishes flipping in the tank. Otherwise, there were many different sea creatures to see. The stall owners usually speak Korean or Mandarin. The abalone is quite cheap, summing up to only 10,000W for three! Just choose the fish/shell fish you would want to eat, then head out to look for a restaurant to prepare the food for you (at a cost). These restaurants are above the market, or some are slightly outside the market. We went as a couple, and many of these restaurants rejected us once they knew it's only two people, with not many items. If you want to eat there, be sure to purchase more items to eat then. We spent around 30,000W just for the preparation of our seafood, which I thought as quite expensive. You will also have to sit on the floor, the Korean way, so be sure to wear appropriate clothing as well."
76,5.0,"OMG..forget about the local aquarium; just go to this market and marvel at the amount of sea life here..most of it still alive.  after getting your fill visually...select your fare and then take it to one of the several eateries they will kill it, cut it, grill it, steam it or whatever for you.  Unbelievable we had so much fun here.  The rule is go where the locals go and i can say that we spent hours here and did not see another non-asian entity.  So no or very little english spoken or signed,  we were fortunate to be escorted by someone who has done it before.  Be bold , get some help but do not miss this experience!!"
77,5.0,"freshest fish I've ever had, easy fast. loved the octopus sashimi. they steamed a king crab for us, best I've ever had. it was a quarter of the price im used to it being and it was larger than a medium sized child."
78,4.0,Place to go to try Korean specialty live octopus. Purchase seafood from vendor and take it to nearest eatery. There are number of restaurants that prepare food for you. Place is open until late evening hours. We left at 9 PM
79,5.0,"It was a very interesting experience. This is a big fish market, many vendors and lots of fish options.Many of the seafood is still alive and you can actually choose whatever you want from the tanks. Once bagged, you just take it to one of the few establishments located in a second floor where you can have it grilled, barbecued, or steamed. Them they serve it with sides of rices, seaweed salad and so on.It's not cheap, but it's fun and it's fresh."
80,4.0,We had fun at this market. Shopping for the freshest seafood and bringing it to the restaurants upstairs to eat and immerse in the local atmosphere. If you do have a king crab- get the chef to cook up a fried rice in its 'juice'!
81,3.0,"The place was buzzing with hundreds of different stalls with many different kinds of seafood living and dead, however most stalls sold the same things. The staff would often call out too you which became a little annoying after awhile (Though most seemed friendly enough). Barely anything was written in English, and I personally found it a bit difficult to navigate. Ended up paying about 36k for a two person plate of sashimi  which seemed a little steep. Worth reading some of the other reviews for tips before going to cut down on confusion."
82,4.0,This Fish Market is worth a visit (and it can be very easily reached by line 1 from the centre of Seoul. The market is just next to the station.Large selection of seafood. You can buy quality (and cheap) sashimi as take away or you can have your purchase processed for you into a meal in one of the many restaurants directly in the market. It is tasty fun.
83,2.0,It was very easy to reach the fish market by Seoul subway. Mesmerised by the variety of seafood. There were so fresh and colorful and we wanted to capture these in our cameras. Unfortunately the stall holders were not too friendly. My hubby was snapping some lovely fresh prawns with his camera and this lady store holder shouted at him in a very rude manner. We were shocked by her behaviour. So I just quickly told my hubby not to take photos of her prawns. Anyway despite this bad encounter we managed to take some nice shots of this colorful market.There were some fresh vegetables too along the side lanes. A great place to visit..just be careful not to take photos of that rude store lady's seafood..
84,4.0,"In case you love fish and seafood - this is the best place in Seoul. The selection is fantastic, the quality superb. You're not only getting lobster, crab, fish and sashimi, you're also able to try the real stuff, such as Uni and San Nak Ji (living octopus), see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpEKxS9g-3M. For us this was the ultimate food experience in Seoul, even the fish market in Busan is better by far."
85,3.0,"Not much difference from Jagalchi market.  See my review on Jagalchi market.  Except that Noryangjin.   From the subway,  you need to put in some effort to locate this market but its not difficult. No worries if you dont speak Korean,  quite a handful of the store people are able to speak chinese"
86,4.0,"I sought fish markets in many places ,but didn't sought such diversity of fishes ,crabs, prawns,and other sea creatures,that I don't know their names, all inscription on water tanks were on Korean ,you may choose any of products ,and there you have on second floor few restaurants where will cook for you your catch ,ask to prepare you sashimi it will be good choice.. It not cheap place but you may try bargain."
87,4.0,"It's quite an experience walking through the market with ahjummas beckoning you over to enquire the prices of their seafood. Their products are generally the same so just buy from the ahjumma whom you can connect with. We bought scallops, abalone, giant prawn and a long-legged crab from the same store; and asked for a discount on the total price. The price of the seafood was quite reasonable given that they were fresh and live when we bought them. The fee charged by the restaurant was rather expensive though. It was quite a satisfying meal. We wanted to go again the next day but did not as we were running out of Korean Won."
88,4.0,"really enjoy this wholesale seafood market. We came nearly lunch time and walked from store to store admiring the range of life seafood ( types that being displayed and for sale). This particular store sells more than 8 types of. Prawns, shrimps and lobsters. An eye opener for me. One store sells nothing but octopus only. If you don't speak Korean, some store owners do speak mandarin as they hired chinese staff to help them to promote their produce to the China tourists. Sashimi are fresh and cheap. Don't go for salmon as all are imported. Go for the sea bass.  Please also check your pick to ensure they are alive and fresh when you pick them, especially crabs that you are going to pay a lot more for it. There are Restuarant runners that will bring you to their Restuarant to cook the purchase for you for a fee. You do not need to bring back the purchase home. All bargaining starts with tapping on the calculator."
89,5.0,"We arrived at the market around 9pm and had great fun with the traders selecting fish, jumbo prawns, scallops and octopus (a little overboard for two people) and were taken into the best dining experience ever.The restaurant we were guided to was in the market but not upstairs, in a separate little building behind it. It was a very full house over-brimming with loud, hilarious people enjoy copious bottles of soju. We stayed until past midnight and hope to go again soon"
90,5.0,"This is the first thing my wife and I did in Seoul. It was really cool seeing all the different seafood, and watching the people sell their wares. After walking around for about an hour, we decided to buy one giant crab, and a flounder, which wad cut up into sashimi. We went downstairs to a restaurant where they took our fish and crab, they brought out the sashimi with some sides and we dug in. The sashimi wad very tasty, but a whole flounder, wow a lot. By the time we ate half of the fish they brought out our crab, this was the tastiest crab I have ever had. I have a feeling whenever I have had crab legs before, they were frozen, instead of from a live crab, or maybe it was the species of crab but damn it was. My wife wants to go get another one. If you like fresh seafood, definitely check out this market!"
91,3.0,"slightly different variant of the Tokyo version.  I will leave some suspense there.  Unlike the one in Tokyo, don't get there before noon."
92,3.0,"Market is located next to Noryangjin Station. Take exit 1 and cross the overhead bridge. There are plenty of stalls to get your seafood. We ordered a small octopus, a hairy crab and 2 huge tiger prawns and were brought to a small restaurant. However, it was over-crowded and having waited for quite a while, we were lead to a back alley sidewalk cafe which is kinda run-down. We were charged an additional  30,000 won on top of the seafood we've paid earlier, just for cooking and serving our seafood!"
93,5.0,"Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market is considered the largest seafood market in Seoul, bringing over several hundred different seafood items daily. Noryangjin Fish Market operates all year round and is open to both merchants and consumers. Within the market are many independent restaurants that prepare and serve the fresh seafood purchased at the market, which is a very popular experience among tourists.During our trip to Korea, it was without a doubt that we would visit Noryangjin Fish Market to explore the different types of seafood being sold and experience dining at one of the independent restaurants. As soon as we entered the market, we saw a huge row of sellers displaying their fresh catch. Every station was organized and presented their seafood in clean tanks which was visually appealing. There were so many different kinds of seafood to choose from, but one thing we wanted to try for sure was Olive Founder, also known as Gwangeo ê´‘ì–´, prepared as hoe (raw fish). We didn't walk very far when we stumbled upon a station selling Gwangeo and other types of fresh fish. The seller was very kind and helped us choose the rest of our seafood that we wanted to eat for lunch. We chose Gwangeo and two other types of fish (we don't remember), fresh oysters and live octopus. After choosing our seafood, a worker took us to the restaurant which was located upstairs across the seller. After being seated, we were first given the oysters along with sides to eat with our meal. The oysters were extremely fresh with a delicious taste of the ocean. They tasted like nothing we've ever tried before! We were then given a plate of the live octopus, also known as Sannakji ì‚°ë‚™ì§€, cut up into bite sized pieces. Sannakji has gained a lot of attention worldwide for being served raw in it's live state, still squirming around. My bf had already tried sannakji before and had wanted me to try it just for the experience. I was pretty scared, but ended up trying little pieces which tasted pretty good. The only thing I didn't like was the suction feeling of the octopus sticking to the sides of my mouth so I made sure I chewed them quickly before swallowing them. Following the sannakji, a plate of the three fish we chose arrived beautifully sliced. People can choose to eat the hoe on it's own or with the accompanied sides consisting of soy sauce with wasabi, chogochujang, green chili pepper, garlic and lettuce. The gwangeo had a nice soft texture and tasted absolutely delicious. Since we were so used to eating thawed raw fish at sushi restaurants in Toronto, it was awesome to have finally tried fresh hoe. After finishing all the raw seafood, a server brought out a pot of Maeuntang ë§¤ìš´íƒ•, Korean spicy fish soup, that was made with all the remaining parts of the three fish that were served as hoe. The broth was very flavourful with a spicy kick. This was a delicious end to our perfect meal! The amount of food we got was more than enough for two people and by the time we finished eating we were stuffed. There was a counter at the front where we were able to pay for everything, which included the price of all the seafood we chose.I highly recommend people to visit Noryangjin Fish Market because it's truly a wonderful experience to see all the different types of seafood and to enjoy a freshly prepared meal for lunch or dinner!"
94,3.0,"Wide array of seafood available. Most sellers were selling similar items and hand gestures will do even if you cannot speak Korean. Wear a good pair of shoes as the market floor is very wet. Not the cheapest seafood around though, going to a restaurant along the market to get them to cook to your liking costs extra."
95,4.0,Wow.  Talk about seeing every possible sea creature right there in front of you.  This place is a must see at least once.  Stall upon stall of fresh fish and other things from the sea.  You can also buy your goods and take them upstairs and the restaurant will cook it for you.  It was very easy to get to off of the subway - Noryangjin stop.
96,2.0,"We walked in and it's huge! We were intending to buy some seafood and bring it up to a restaurant. As we walked through we were approached as you'd expect but the mainland Chinese sellers were the worst. They would follow us. I pretended u didn't understand them.So we decided to check out the restaurants upstairs first and see which ones were crowded and to check prices. We walked past a few and they happily showed us menus. Then we got to one and they didn't want to show us a menu. They said go buy your food first and come back and insisted that they take us. They were mainland Chinese. We kept saying it was OK, thank you and proceeded to leave. The lady started to follow us and was very pushy. We just kept walking. The man from the same restaurant who was wanting to escort us back down to buy seafood kept following us around the market. We were so annoyed that we just left the market without eating altogether.My summary.... great market with so much fresh seafood.... ruined by pushy mainlanders."
97,5.0,"My husband and I visited the Noryangjin market and it was one of our favorite experiences in Seoul! We explored the market area and visited with vendors before ultimately purchasing some seafood and taking it to a restaurant upstairs to eat. Neither of us speak Korean, but we didn't have any difficulties. For more details, pictures, and video, including our efforts to eat raw octopus, check out my article at http://wanderlustandlipstick.com/blogs/unchartedterritory/2014/11/16/noryangjin-fish-market/"
98,4.0,"Interesting fish market where you will find lots of sea creatures. There are restaurants nearby where you can purchase the seafood and ask them to cook (grill, fry, etc) with a small charge."
99,5.0,"For those of you who don't get a chance to visit the shorelines of Korea for seafood, this is probably the next best thing. Situated on the Noryangjin subway line (there is a stop that's directly connected to the fish mart), its super easy find. The minute you walk in, you'll notice hundred of vendors that are competing for your business. So much so that a few kept following us around. We had such a great food experience that we ended up going twice - but the weekends seemed much busier (and more expensive). The best thing for you to do is pick a vendor that has EVERYTHING that you want for more buying power. Some of these vendors speak English and Chinese, but we were fluent in Korean which helped out a lot when we were negotiating the prices - cash also helps. We got a large king crab, shrimp, octopus, uni and sashimi for about $100 USD. The second time we went (to the same vendor who gave us a bigger discount.. or so she says) we got a huge lobster, shrimp, octopus, scallops, and some sweet crab for about $120 USD. They slice the fish fresh, but take you upstairs where the restaurant cooks and serves the bountiful seafood along with side dishes - it consisted of kimchi, garlic, lettuce wraps and various vegetables. Hot fish stew also came with the meal and we purchased a few bottles of beer and soju. In the end, the restaurant charged us about $50-60 USD. This place isn't the best place for children since it gets so hectic - not to mention slippery since the grounds are constantly wet, so wear appropriate shoes. The public bathrooms are also quiet messy and I would recommend you bring your own toilet paper as well. But this place is AWESOME if you have a hungry stomach and a large wallet. But if you're on vacation, why not splurge a little?  You'll never forget the experience!"
100,5.0,"This fish market is a ""not to be missed"" attraction! Fish, squid, really huge crabs etc - all fresh. Just looking at the market is just part of the experience. But you must also eat there for the full experience! If you love sashimi and crabs, this is the place to be. How it works is that you purchase the seafood from any stall (you can buy crabs from one stall, fish from another, octopus from a third etc) and bring the fresh seafood to the 2nd floor and have any of the restaurants cook it for you at an agreed cooking price. Negotiate with the restaurant about the price so that you wouldn't get any price shock. As a guideline, we had butter crabs, fish soup, grilled prawns and live baby octopus for a cooking fee of KRW40,000. Overall, it is not a cheap meal but worth the price and experience for a really fresh seafood meal."
101,5.0,"Seoul is known for its good eats - and this is no exception!  The market is incredibly large, and there are hundreds of stalls of fresh seafood - from abalone to octopus to stingray.  Locals and foreigners come to buy live seafood which then can get cooked immediately at a restaurant either in the basement or upstairs.  Even if you don't fancy live octopus in your mouth, the place itself is a cultural experience!!"
102,1.0,"If you go very early in the morning you will see and learn a lot.  If you go at dinner time, the fish mongers will quote outrageous prices, without an apologetic tone.  This is the only place I have ever questioned the ethics of Korean merchants.  Hey tourists, get smart, don't pay three times the retail price at a wholesale market."
103,2.0,"As foreigners , it is good to watch ,not to eat there . If you want nice Sashimi it is better to eat at proper restaurant or  Lotte foods court/premium .   Difficult to communicate and turn out quite expensive with something you may not like ,such as six bad smell clams ! Price is given ,no bargain. Eating place/restuarant  has no chairs, sitting down Japanese/Korean style .Unless you feel  adventurous ,it is not recommended ,it is mainly for local."
104,4.0,"We ordered fish sashimi, prawns & scallops which were really fresh & tasty especially when you savour it with soju on a cold night. Honestly speaking , i would only go there again if I am with a local (my guide was a Korean) as there were so many stalls hogging you & you were not sure which stall has the best price. It is also a nice place to see so many locals hang out after their working hours, couples dating etc it was a good interesting experience."
105,4.0,"This market is huge! Within are stall after stall piled high with seemingly every kind of ocean dwelling creature. When I went with my girlfriend, we jostled for space with crowds of other picture-snapping tourists and regular customers perusing the day's catch. Vendors constantly hawked their wares, calling out to us to try their sashimi. Live octopi attempted to sucker their way out of the plastic bags of paying customers, while monge (sea squirt), a delicacy unique to this part of the world, sat in abundant prominence. We ended up buying a single monge to take home and sashimi ourselves. It tasted fine with copious amounts of gochujang (chili pepper sauce), but the texture was a little difficult to handle. We'll be back soon to try out the restaurants!"
106,3.0,"This fish market is huge and will be very interesting especially for those who have never experienced an asian wet market.The vendors sell sashimi ( either fresh cut from selected fish or prepacked varieties ), yup can see them slicing the fish there! There are alao an array of oysters and snow crab seemed to be the key thing to eat.Prices for most items are quite reasonable except maybe the snow crab was quite expensive (50,000 won) to serve 2, although it was still bit on the large side for the two of us!We purchased a crab, oysters and sashimi. Unfortunately we had a fair amount of trouble finding one of the restaurants to serve us upstairs, this may have been because we did not have enough food which needed cooking! It was also extremely difficult being unable to speak korean!Eventually we found somewhere to serve us for 10k won including streaming our crab. The sashimi was delicious and fresh but the experience overall was mediocre and I would probably not do it again."
107,5.0,"My wife and I just visited the Noryangjin Fish market today.  It was a great experience and the photo opportunities were great.  We bought a king crab for 115,000 wan (50 wan/kg - probably some foreigner tax in there), and some shrimp.  We went to a restaurant and had them cook it on the spot.  I'd recommend this to anyone who likes seafood.  The place on the first floor all the way at the end had a picture of Jessica alba and her friends.  They cooked our crab perfectly."
108,4.0,"Went in the evening, seemed a lot were closed.  Only ones open were the sit on the floor type.  Great if you are flexible enough for that, but not sure we can bend that way anymore.If you love seafood and fish this is a great place, especially if you know what you want.  Of course knowing a little Korean would help so either be able to pick out what you want on sight or be able to ask for it in Korean.Certainly go to the fish market at least for the experience."
109,5.0,"Amazing to see the fish market working.  The variety of live fish/seafood, people making their purchases and the vendors preparing the food.We went there on Christmas Eve with the intent of buying our dinner and having it cooked for us.  Plenty of vendors were open but it seemed there were limited restaurants open.  Almost all of them were of the sit on the floor variety (All could be that way but not all were open, just didn't feel we'd enjoy the meal in that position, just not that flexible).Either way it was fascinating to see.It was not completely obvious, certainly at night, the direction to the fish market coming out of the subway.  Need to head toward the overpass to the train station and continue over it to get to the fish market."
110,5.0,"If you only have a few days in Seoul, this place is a must! A huge warehouse with multiple vendors of every kind of seafood imaginable. This market had a nice mix of native Korean seafood such as abalone and sea cucumber and also featured seafood from around the globe such as imported whole Bluefin Tuna, Russian Spiny Crab, and every type of shrimp imaginable. I was able to get a pretty hefty selection of whole fish, squid, shrimp, and scallop for around $80 without doing any bargaining. I think I probably could have bargained down another $10 or so as I did most of my shopping with the same vendor. You can take your pick of seafood upstairs to one of the many restaurants who will gut, clean, and cook all the seafood to splendid Korean perfection for you in no time.

It was wet and dank (a rainy day when I went) and the array of seafood on sale was an eye-opener. Apparently, you can buy whatever you want and get the 2nd floor restaurants to cook them for you. Just don't go with someone who is squeamish about buying live food to eat them ... Like I did."
112,3.0,"When we went to the Noryangjin fish market , we were met by a lot of vendors trying to sell their fish . We bought some oysters and a grouper. We  were led to a restaurant ,one flight down from the ground floor. We asked them to cook the oysters and the grouper. There is a cooking fee plus a charge of all the appetizers  kimchi, cucumbers, and side orders for rice. The only mistake we did was to order fish head soup , of which, the fish we didnt buy ourselves. The fish head was not so fresh. They speak  very little English, so I think knowing the basic ingredients in korean or carrying an English Korean dictionary would be an advantage"

We read so much about this fish market, however it is not as busy as the one found at Tsukiji  Fish Market in Japan. You also do not have to wake up so early  because this is opened all day ,  to witness the activities, as compared to Tsukiji , wherein one needs to be up by 430AM to witness the fish auction.  Here, we did not witness a fish auction. The market is clean and the vendors are friendly. Compare the prices before committing to buy. There are numerous stalls which can cook the fresh seafood that one buys. We were brought to a restaurant , at the basement where one can seat comfortably."
114,4.0,"Not your typical tourist spot... but lots of fun wandering down all the lanes of fishmongers.  You'll see aquatic creatures here the likes of which you've never seen before... and probably never will again... and the best thing about it - you can eat them all!!!We had a great time picking out the things we wanted to eat.  And all the little restaurants along the walls serve the freshest seafood.  You may not want to eat everything you see, but you can't deny it's fresh.A great place to check out.  We got there in the early hours (jetlag) and got to watch a little fish auction.  Didn't understand a single word exchanged, but enjoyed being a part of it.It was a little hard to find, hidden in a huge warehouse poorly marked.  Had trouble asking some of the locals where it was because the older men didn't want to talk to me, but the younger generation are much more helpful and friendly.I'm surprised this place is rated so highly on tripadvisor because we didn't see a single other tourist the entire 2 hours we spend walking around in here.  But I definitely recommend checking it out.  Its interesting.  We picked out some small octopus and fish and had a nice little restaurant cook them up right there for us.  Accompanied by soup and other side dishes.  Not a fancy restaurant, but great and authentic.  I recommend wearing the appropriate footwear though.  My shoes were ruined after.  The floor is wet and your shoes are bound to absorb some of that pungent water on the ground.  Do not wear heels ladies!!!  And guys - I had to throw out my sneakers after.  Highly recommended."
115,2.0,"Maybe it was the mid-morning, early summer heat, but there is a distinct fishiness to the Noryahngjin Fish Markets at 1100h in mid June.  The fish markets are literally across the tracks from the Noryangin metro station.  On the footbridge across the tracks don't forget to checkout the old movie posters for Indiana Jones, Terminator 2, and Total Recall (the original, that is!).Unfortunately, the stench of the fish smell starts before you reach the fish markets.  This smell isn't there all year round, and is a mixture of fishing village, fishing village mud, and drying fish.  It can be too much for some to stomach.The fish market itself was still full of produce at mid-morning, which I think indicates a large retail focus.  There weren't a lot of wholesale buyers visible by 1100h.  The point of sale marketing is brutal, even for Korea!  There is plenty of crustaceans, live except for the prawns.  Some of the prawns were the size of a small lobster.  There are live fish, including flat fish, but the selection of live fish were limited.  The market is a fraction of the size of Tokyo (Tsukiji fish markets has a pleasant smell, by the way), but is far larger than the one back home.  Restaurants run the length of the market above the floor, but given the smells we couldn't face it.  The markets and displays of seafood make good photographic subjects.This is recommended for anyone who has not seen a large fresh seafood market, but this is a distant second best to Tokyo's Tsukiji fish market.  This is not recommended in summer months for those sensitive to strong fish smells, but this is not such a problem in cooler months."

There are interesting types of seafood on sale and many stalls but after taking a short walk around, I realized the stalls sell more or less the same varieties. Basically, you pick whatever live seafood you like, haggle a price if you like, and carry it with you to a nearby restaurant (The stall owner will direct you to one) where you can choose how you'll like your selection to be cooked or simply sliced up into sashimi.In my opinion, I would recommend coming to this place for a unique experience, more than a good seafood dinner. Just a tip,  cabs do not stop to pick up passengers from the main road. You have to walk towards the train station to catch a cab."
117,4.0,It's a good place to eat seafood. There's a place with flesh seafood. You should negotiate with the fish seller for the pricing.There're some restaurants to cook the seafood that you buy from the market. They are located on the upper floor.
118,4.0,Take line 1 to Noryangjin Railway station and cross the footbridge over the railway tracks. Bg market with many seafood restaurants on second floor. Be aware of the strong smell.
119,3.0,"We found the process of buying your seafood from a fishmonger n bringing  it to a restaurant to cook to be a hassel; n also exposes a tourist to risks n uncertainties. We also found it to be very expensive.If you are adventurous, I would recommend u try the food stalls in Gwangjang Market for fresh oysters n seafood sashimi. Oysters were Won20,000 per dozen n they were excellent. Shashimi was Won10,000 a plate. Although the fish is not live but u need to be aware most Japanese chefs will tell u fish has to be aged before it can be served. Otherwise the texture will be too rubbery and lack the tender bite of properly treated fish. It could be as little as a day, for white fish like flounder.We had a live whole flounder prepared for sashimi on Taejondae Beach in Busan for Won30,000, n it was rubbery/tough. The same costs Won70,000 in Noryangjin, We also went to Jagalchi Seafood Market in Busan n found the seafood restaurants there to be better value for money."
120,3.0,"Yes, there are a lot of different seafood to choose from and the price is not bad.However the eating area is not very clean and therefore you do not get full dining experience.Somehow I just wonder if they can make the most of it by setting up some higher end area for those wanted to seat comfortable."
121,4.0,"Like their local fish market, there are lots of live seafood. You can choose what you want to eat and then paid for it and bring up to a restaurant and they will cook for you (at a price, of cuz). I had dry bad diarrhea and puking two days after that - not sure whether it was stomach flu or food poisoning....."
122,5.0,A visit to the fish market is a must.  It's fascinating to see rows upon rows of vendors selling everything from flounders to sea slugs.  Just wander around and check it all out.  You can also buy fish and bring it upstairs to one of the many restaurants and have them prepare it for you.  We did this with a variety of fish and shellfish and it was a blast.  Note that very few of the vendors speak English.  The concierge at our hotel wrote out what we wanted to do in Korean and we just showed the vendors the note and picked out our fish.  Have fun!
123,4.0,"Went around midnight with out food tour guide. The place was not a busy, but still plenty of open stalls and enough fresh creatures in the live tanks. As a tourist you would probably pay way to much for the fishies, and the mongers are known to switch fresh catch for dead after the sale so you have to keep your eyes open, or better go with a local. We made a late night snack out of some life octopus, a flounder shashimi and some 'squirt'. After buying the seafood you bring your bag to one of the restaurants downstairs. Again, as foreigner you need to be assertive and know market price for seating and preparation, but the end result is awesome. Get a bottle of cheap beer and shosu to mix, and you will have an meal to remember."
124,3.0,"The fish market is very interesting and worth a visit but don't bother eating there. We paid a high price for some sea food expecting a well prepared meal. However the food was prepared without care, the side salad was wilted,the atmosphere was industrial to say the least and we had to pay extra for preparation after paying top price for the sea food (the only time we were ripped off in Korea). So have a look and then go over the road to one of the many small establishments selling great food."
