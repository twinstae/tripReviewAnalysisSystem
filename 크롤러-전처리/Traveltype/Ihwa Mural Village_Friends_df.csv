1,4.0,"It's nice to walk around! Be prepared to face some big stairs though.Also, it's not that big so you'll be finished in no time"
2,5.0,"We stumbled across this village as we were walking to our next destination and saw some really beautiful wall art. A really lovely little stumble, even in the rain!"
3,4.0,"Sick of palaces? Then this is a different, good 2-3 hour activity that you can do without a tour guide. Requires an average level of fitness; quite steep.Very cool part of Seoul that has a number of pokey cafes from which you can view the city and have a coffee or beer.The murals themselves are pretty good, but they could do with more. There is plenty more space to be utilised."
4,4.0,It is a very peaceful village located in Seoul. There are many murals which you can take a photo with. My favorite mural is the wing painting. The village has many stairs so make sure that you are in a fit condition when going there.
5,5.0,"Who will not be captivated with Street Art? But this small community in Seoul is a priceless gem of all for me. I love walking on every alleys of this community because every steps I take is another art. Installation, mural, photography, wrought metal art and seeing a fantastic view of the city!"
6,5.0,Found this place through some travel apps.Glad that it is not crowded and you can enjoy your photo shooting here :)Very nice and relaxing place with a lot of nice Caf√©. It is also known for Korean Drama filming place - such as The Rooftop Prince.
7,3.0,"for k-drama lover, this place is a must visit. You can find some drama shooting location here such as BongSun house from drama Strong Women Do Bongsun. The pictures also nice, but there are some pictures that has been deleted. And please noted, this is some neighbourhood area so you can not disturb people who live there by speak loudly. There even some old lady who seat in the street and holding a sign ""please speak quietly""."
8,3.0,"We dropped by Ihwa Mural Village after the hike up to Naksan Park (which was nice and quiet, but the view of Seoul that it offers isn't anything astounding). There were some nice murals in the village, but overall, it seems quite run down. It's worth noting that two of the more popular murals you might see online (the koi and flower murals on the staircases) were painted over by locals last year, so it was a bit disappointing.I wouldn't recommend it for a short visit to Seoul as there are other places that might be more worth your time. If you do plan to go though, come in comfortable shoes as it's around a 20 minute walk uphill from the train station. There are a few coffee shops in the area if you plan to stay a bit longer and enjoy the place."
9,4.0,"Ihwa Mural Village is located 3/4 of the way up the Seoul city wall. It is a great spot to stop, get a coffee or a snack and snap a few pictures of the fun murals! There are maps on buildings that will show you were each mural is located throughout the village."
10,4.0,"Ihwa mural village is located near Naksan park, you have to get thru the park to get to the village... be prepared to walk a lot. The popular murals like the fish and flower staircase are no longer there. It's covered with grey paint now. A pity. The whole area was quite interesting to look at, with little cafes and shops around. Not bad if you have time.. but we found gamcheon culture village in Busan more attractive."
11,5.0,"We were here on the 1st day of Seollal. Most shops were close. The neighbourhood is quiet eventhough there were tourists or visitors like us walking around admiring the neighbourhood and its creative surroundings. There were many graphics,  wall arts and at installations worth admiring and taking photos with. A few cafes with free wifi were opened when we were there so we had no problem having a good lunch at a nice warm place. We even get to eat hot sweet potatoes while walking up the neighbourhood. Walking around this area, you will experience and get to see how the working class in Korea used to live in the older days. If you are interested to stay within this area, there is a guest house - Rose & Candy Guesthouse with a View. I did not see the interior but u can check them out by calling 010 8828 3720. According to one flea market seller we met, on normal days (non-holidays and especially weekend), there will be many sellers there selling accesories and artistic pieces. The view - once you are at the highest point of the village is really nice. You should bring a good camera when you are here and put on good shoes as the steps are old grounds so they are not flat and smooth. There are many slopes and uneven ground so be careful when walking. Important thing to note is this is a local neighbourhood. It is a residential area. So walk quietly and do not make noise or litter the area. It is a public place so respect the environment."
12,3.0,"This place is easy to reach by bus or subway and nice to visit in the morning.If you walk to the village in early morning, sometimes you might catch the fog and feels like you're walking between the clouds!I walked to the top of the village (hike for a bit, about 30-45mins), but the view is worth it!When you reached the top, there's a small playground nearby and you can stop by to take a picture from that place.The view from the top is quite similar with Gamcheon Village in Busan; the difference is just the buildings are not painted in colors.If you love seeing the arts, mural on the wall or unique graffiti, then I will recommend this place to you."
13,5.0,A creative way to express the culture of korean people. Peaceful village with cute drawings. But we need to climb ub a bit to reach the village and quiet far from the subway station
14,4.0,"Ihwa Mural Village has a bunch of beautiful drawings, and the drawings painted on wall or even stairs. But it's so sad that some of those drawings been erased due to some conflicts between the people who live there. In fact there are actual people and family live in there, so when it becomes famous alot of tourists come and go and it makes the neighborhood become crowded, and some of the tourists just easily go inside the house because they don't know there's a family who live there. So for you who still want to go here, please pay attention not to make noise while you're walk around and enjoying the neighborhood ;)"
15,3.0,"I searched a lot of information about korean scenery spots when I planning go to Korea. Therefore, I found Korean Mural Village is the most famous and special. Ihwa Mural Village is the best wall painting. I really looked forward going to there.   When I got off from subway, the place was hard to find. Asked some passerby, they all nice to tell me how to go to the mural village.  However, I felt a little bit disappointed that the goldfish stairs and flower stairs were painted over with grey paint. It is said that local residents felt angry because tourists were so noisy. They said tourists disturb their life. Although there are some beautiful paintings were gone, it is also worth to visit. There are many kinds of wall paintings, they made the village become more colorful and full of vigor.   If you want to go to the Ihwa Mural Village to take a visit, please speak whispered and respect to the residents."
16,5.0,I came to Ihwa with my friends. We walk for about 700m I think? Along the way we can see some clothing store and resto/cafe. The location is on top of the hill so we can see the beautiful scenery. The mural was great and i met an old lady who owns mini store and she was so friendly!
17,4.0,"Bear with the steep road and long walking distance. but it worth a visit. Unfortunately during my time went there, the mural of carp fish on the stairs is not there anymore. probably they want to change the design. or or or maybe i the one who didn't find it. and some of the spot of this place is once drama shooting location. I enjoyed my time here as i also be able to watched seoul scenery from the top.Cool!"
18,4.0,"Although its high up there on the top of the mountain and its summer, which means you have to sweat all the way up to the village, It's quite a nice place to take pictures around. Nice cafes around the area too. However, remember to keep quite while you're hanging around there."
19,3.0,"It's interesting to see paintings all around the village. Expect to do a lot of a walking so it'll be pretty tiring on a sunny day. The famous paintings are now gone, they covered it with grey paint."
20,5.0,"i was very sad i cant take photos with the famous sunflower stairs since it got vandalized 2-3 days before our visit. but still got chance to take pic with the fish stairs mural (before it also got vandalized -___- few days later)i enjoy this part of seoul very much, although its a steep house area, need effort to take pretty pic. there's art in every corner of ihwa. lastly, i hope tourists will not talk loudly here as it will annoy the house owner, which later lead to the vandalizing of mural/stairs. i wish i can visit again next year"
21,4.0,"You can find interesting art along the walls as you wander along. Unforunately, the more famous paintings were gone so that was a big disappointment. When you first arrive, definitely eat at the milk ice cream place, it is SO GOOD! Climb the stairs to the top of the  village, and you feel the amazing breeze and see the view of Seoul."
22,4.0,Another must visit! Walk on the narrow streets and admire the works of talented artists. There are plenty of stairs but you can always take a break and take pictures with the paintings. There will be a lot of walking and it is on hill but it's definitely worth the effort.They change the paintings every now and then and some of the walls may be under construction but despite that there will be enough to see!
23,4.0,"I chanced upon a travel blog post on the Ihwa Mural village and decided to visit this place during my 7 days stay in Seoul. Visitors can find the many beautiful wall paintings and sculptures scattered around the village, all of which were create by ‚ÄúArt in the City‚Äù project.It was a sunny day and my Sister and I reached the village around 2pm. Unique and cosy cafes and shops dotted the streets as we walked from the Hyehwa subway station. It is around 1km walk from the station.I have read that 2 residents have removed some of the murals as protest against the tourists noise and disturbance caused to the residents. Obvious signs are seen reminding tourists to respect the resident privacy but apparently the unfortunate events happened.The small surprises along the streets as we explore the alleys was a nice experience. On a weekday afternoon, there were not many people and gives a peaceful and tranquil atmosphere. We had a short rest in one of the cafes at the top of the hill. It is advisable to plan at least half a day here to slowly explore the uniqueness of this village while paying attention to control the noise level when walking around the alleys. We need to learn to respect and protect the beautiful places if we still want to enjoy them.I will come back to visit the village again and explore through the old Seoul city wall trek from Dongdaemun."
24,4.0,"Once you get out of hyehwa station exit 2, keep walking until you get to dunkin donuts and turn left. And then it's a bit of a climb to get there but worth it!We were lucky there weren't many people there when we went so didn't have to wait long to take photos and could take our time. We were sad when we got there that the stairs mural with the flowers wasn't there, but most of the other murals were still looking fresh. We weren't sure where the murals were so we just kept walking around exploring side streets, and then a kind ahjumma kept ushering us towards a direction which turned out to be the right direction. At the end there are a few pavillions to rest in the shade which was amazing in summer, and it's also nice to sit along the seoul city wall under a tree and look at the view. I also recommend going to naksan park which leads on from the top of the mural village, which can lead you back down to the main road."
25,4.0,"Advise to go in the day time to take picturesque photos. Beautiful street art here but be prepared that there is a lot of walking and uneven steps around.It is located near Naksan Park. There was flea market around the station exit when I went. From Line 4 Hyehwa station Exit 2, walk around 15 mins before you reach the entrance of Ihwa Mural Village, where you can see a long flight of brick steps. To get around Ihwa Mural Village, refer to my map indicating the different routes and attractions. They are located at different areas of the village."
26,4.0,Ihwa Mural Village is a area close to Hyewha subway station. Some art students from the university decorated the streets and walls with beautiful and fun paintings. This is a great area for some fun photography and has a lot of small coffee shops and bakeries to full a half day. It is also close to Naksan Park and you can enjoy a stroll along one of the cities old walls.
27,3.0,"It's located in Ihwa Dong, Jongno-Gu, SeoulWe should walk uphill to reach this place, about 15 minute from Hyehwa station. So it is a little bit tiring.We could find art street in this village. There are mural paintings or mosaics on the walls and on the staircases.There are a small post office, where my friend send a postcard to Indonesia from here.A good place to visit."
28,4.0,"Cute village where the walls and stairs are painted. Makes for great photos. Lots of cafes to eat at and handmade items for sale. It's uphill so if you're not in shape, prepare to get winded."
29,5.0,"Walk from HyeHwa station (subway line 4). Amazing visuals. Interesting murals that expressed the views of the Koreans - especially if you can read Hangul.. (there was one on the island dispute with China/Japan hahahaha) Prepare to climb stairs, prepare to wait for others to finish taking photos and if you do walk all the way to the end - be amazed at the landscape of houses =)Don't worry about food - there are cafes."
30,5.0,Though very crowded. New paintings are not as nice as the old ones. Climbing up the stairs to reach the Seoul City Wall is a kind of 2-in-1 experience.
31,3.0,"This place isn't necessarily located in a convenient place near most hotels or other sightseeing areas so I would say it is only worth visiting if you are nearby or really interested in seeing a different, more quiet side of town. It is located near hyewha station but you do need to trek quite a ways away from the main action and into some pretty narrow paths up a hill through a quiet neighborhood to reach naksan park and the murals themselves. Depending on when you visit the murals might be in pretty good shape having just been repainted, or you might show up and find a mural that's barely visible because it's so faded and hasn't been retouched in a while."
32,3.0,Need to walk uphill.little wall art compare to others. Not worth visiting this place unless got time.
33,5.0,"Take Seoul Metro Line 4 to Hyehwa Station and Exit 2. Walk straight about 300m then turn left towards Lock Museum. Continue to walk straight up hill to the start of Ihwa Village. If unsure, ask the locals there. Note that there's a lot of uneven steps (without railing) around the village. There are a few cute and quirky cafes too. When walking around the village, just remember to keep the noise level low in respect of the residents there. Walk till the top, you will come across a lane and shop (it's actually a leather handmade shop) where the drama Lovely Girl was filmed. From the lane walk further up, you will get the see the whole view of Ihwa-dong town, mountains and Namsan tower on your left. On your right, it's the Seoul city wall, this village is just next to Seoul city wall. Go early in the morning to avoid crowds for picture taking. Surprisingly there ain't a lot of foreigners tourists visiting this village as compared to local Koreans. You can opt to continue to Naksan Park, which is just next to the village. Allocate 2-3 hours here at the village."
34,5.0,A beautiful and interesting neighbourhood. It was easy to get here via public transport. The walls of the homes are decorated with murals and graffiti. Get ready to snap lots of pictures...You can access Naksan Park from here and catch the breathtaking view. I went ard in the late afternoon and managed to catch the sunset. It was simply beautiful beyond words.
35,5.0,"Went there on 17/11/15. We were lucky that the weather was so nice, sunny dayüòé!The location is convenient. 10 mins walk from Hyehwa-yeok station exit 2.When u walk up the hill, u will reach the entrance of Naksan Park. Turn left and walk all the way down while not entering the park, u will start seeing the paintings and some artworks on ur right side!After u reach a small cafe, go all the way down and u can see all the drawings!"
36,4.0,"The village is an uphill trek with a lot of interesting murals and quirky stuffs. It is a very fun neighborhood. Silence is required in the vicinity, you might disturb the people living there. If you get hungry or thirsty, there are stores which offer food and drinks. Refer to the map so it will be easier to navigate. The trip is a bit tiring since you are going up and down but if you plan your trip, you will not be going in circles and save some of your energy.If you are a K-Drama fan, this is the place where the K-Drama Rooftop Prince was shot."
37,5.0,"A local brought me to Ihwa Mural Village, a fun neighborhood with murals and art tucked around every corner and on staircases in the hills. It was a fun way to spend an afternoon. The views of the city are stunning and there's restaurants and shops to pop into as well. Highly recommend for a place to stretch your legs, see some neat art and catch a panoramic view of the city."
38,4.0,"I wanted to go visiting this place for so long after watching the drama 'rooftop prince' as I like the wall painting. It's a bit troublesome to reach here as even the locals don't really know it. Yet, I'm very thankful to the Korean couple that I met who tried all their means to help me getting there. You can get down from hyehwa station exit 4 (if not mistaken) then go towards the direction of naksan park. It's just next to it I would say. You can spend ur evening time here before dinner. 1 hour in the village and maybe another one in naksan park."
39,4.0,"The hills and stairs are daunting, it's hot out these days and thank goodness I was wearing good sneakers. But the murals and art are worth the effort and the views of the city are the icing on that cake. The area is a little confusing, small stairs and pathways but it's something I was happy to have done."
