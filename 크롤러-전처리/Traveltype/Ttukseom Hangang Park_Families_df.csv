0,4.0,"This is a very nice riverside park in Gwangjin-gu District. It has an outdoor swimming pool, duck boats, water skiiing, inchworm tunnel, etc.Good to visit and relax.- Accessible from Metro #7 Ttukseom Yuwonji. And it's about 15 min walk from Metro #2 #7 Geondae(Geonguk University).- The inchworm tunnel is amazing starting from the metro station. It has several facilities to chill.- The resting area below Cheongdamdaegyo Bridge is cool and good to stay during summer.- There are snack stands, restaurants, bicycle rentals and some other things to enjoy. But, spending no money by chilling is very good as well. Just prepare a  mat to sit on.- The outdoor swimming pool is running during summer."

3,3.0,"We didn't get the chance to ski when we went to Alpensia Resort in Pyeongchang so we looked for a resort in Seoul where we could experience snow tubing or sledding. And luckily we found Ttukseom Hangang Park & Resort.We arrived early and the place was practically empty. Even the other attractions are still closed. But at least the snow tubing is already open. Entrance is cheap and you can slide again and again. You get your own tube ring, go up the hill, sit on the tube and slide down the snow. It was fun but scary at first. But you would want to do it over and over again. No need to far. This place is but the right one for the experience."
