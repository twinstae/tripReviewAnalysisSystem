0,5.0,It's a great mall. You can find international as well as Korean Brand.. everything imaginable is within its walls. The price is according to the brand.
1,4.0,Located at myeongdong very strategic. Connected to lotte department store and many young people come to shopping or find some food.
2,4.0,"This mall is just next to Lotte Mall located in the heart of Myeongdong street. During winter, it was decorate with colorful lights with Christmas theme, which is really beautiful & selfie worthy. There is a permanent SM store & also YG pop-up store which sells kpop merchandise for SM's and YG's artist groups. What I like the most is the LINE store located near to the main entrance, the LINE stuff are really cute tho! But now, you can just go to their cafe in Myeongdong. Besides that, there are a lot of Korean-based clothing/cosmetic selling here such as 3CE, April Skin, NII clothing etc. Their quality are top notch, not like something u see on the market/street."
3,3.0,"Opposite Myeongdong, this 5-or6-storeyed compact young, teenager shopping mall with basement link to Myeongdong underground shopping mall, is quite busy with young teens who craves for Kpop stars ' souvenirs, line friends' products and casual wears. It's quite narrow space, if you are not ""Gen Y"" , this is not your place, however, further go up to 7th-9th floor isLotte duty free shopping mall."
4,1.0,"There are lots of variety of clothing available at Lotte young. Although it's pricy, you will be able to find unique clothing. However, the staff are not friendly and they don't seem to want to help you to get the size you want at all. They don't smile to you. That's not the kind of service that you will want to get for spending so much."
