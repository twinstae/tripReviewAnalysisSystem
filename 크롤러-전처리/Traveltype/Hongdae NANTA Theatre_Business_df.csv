0,4.0,A great show that is both entertaining and fascinating even if you don't speak a word of Korean. Well worth watching
1,5.0,We found the Hongdae theatre was offering discounts to see NANTA (so cheaper than some of the other theatres) and only a subway ride away to a very interteresting University area.
