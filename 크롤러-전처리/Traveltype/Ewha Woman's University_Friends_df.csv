0,5.0,"Honestly I visit Ewha, because of how beautiful the architecture is there and not for the shops around the university. Sure going towards the massive campus you have several different stores, but by all means focus on the beautiful architecture of the university."
1,4.0,I come here with my closed friend. It's a nice university with a good landscape. Ewha is the combination of East and West about architecture. The entrance is very huge. Nice place to walk!
2,1.0,"Don’t ever go to the shoe shop at the end of one of the alleys. The owner threw the shoe, shouted at us and tried stopping us from exiting when we didn’t want to buy the shoes we were trying."
3,3.0,"The street was famous of its 10,000 won bags and 1,000 won socks in the past years.  However, when I visited last week, many of these shops were closed and therefore, my choices were very limited."
4,5.0,It is a shopping paradise for youngsters and students studying in the university. The things are so much cheaper than those in Myeondong and more variety too. The staff of the stalls and shops are also much friendlier than those in Myeondong. This will definitely my 'Must-Go' area for shopping the next time I visit Seoul.
5,5.0,There are alot of fashion stores here in Ewha women univ. The prices here are very mouth watering. You can buy alot of winter coats and jackets in a very cheap price if you go in winter (not sure about other season). The area near the university is so beautiful. Must visit !
6,5.0,"What I like about Ewha University, not only that they have beautiful architecture and surroundings but also the street shops offer cheaper price than any other places in Seoul. Especially for cosmetics.In one of the shop called Baviphat, they sells extremely cheap stuff. Good idea for souvenirs. You should visit this place if you are around the area. Also, near the university, you can find a big LINE Store."
7,5.0,"The street is closed to 2,3 Exit from Ewha University Subway Station. This place is full with store of clothes, shoes,bag and accessories to food. Price are reasonable and most of the store are easy to find. You may visit to Ewha University before or after your shopping. Overall, it is a good place to explore."
8,3.0,"Many clothing and makeup stores as well as places to eat. Unfortunately, the clothing stores don't allow people to try on tops. However, you can try on bottoms. I'm not sure why...maybe because people are sweaty in this hot weather. There are many clothing stores that carry the same items so look around before buying.My main reason for posting this review is to warn others about a store called Baviphat. I was so excited to see makeup products being sold at such a cheap price. But I felt like something just was not right and the actual stores (e.g. Banila) were close by. The staff was also not very welcoming. Once I got wifi, I googled about this store and found out that they sell fakes! So be careful before buying from there."
9,4.0,This is the best place to shop for good quality clothes. Price wise is on the higher side as compared to the normal market place but the design and quality is really good
10,5.0,After visiting EWHA Uni we headed to the street shops along this area.  My daughter told me she felt like stars coming out from her eyes because of seeing trendy clothings and others.  Indeed it s a budget friendly shopping paradise.  Highly recommended if you are in a budget and the working public wifi added up to the experience.
11,5.0,"There are lots of fashion shops in the area, especially you can easily find some cheap bags and mobile case in the area. I have bought a small bag which only cost me 10000 won. Besides, there are also several shops selling icecream, juice, coffee and other snacks which is suitable for chilling in the afternoon."
12,4.0,Can go to the university to take photos first then go to the street to shop. Many pretty affordable clothes. There's stylenanda and line with friends store there as well so you can take photos there.
13,5.0,Always a must go/visit for my trip to Seoul :) must also eat their street food along the fashion street :) During Cherry Blossom season will get to see it there too :) Ewha University entrance cherry blossom tree is beautiful too
14,4.0,The area is smaller and easier to explore compared to Dongdaemun or Myeongdong. The building where Line store is located is a must visit as there are a number of shops in every floor.
15,4.0,Girls' Shopping Paradise and not to worry of not finding at least one item to buy. Trust me I shopped till drop and need to money exchange.
16,5.0,"How did I find out about Ewha Woman's university? I asked the tourist office where is the best place for a manicure/pedicure & hair styling services.....and they pointed to me Sinchon / Ewha Woman's university. At my first visit, I was just checking out the area. Alighted at Sinchon station and walked through Sinchon ""Pedestrian Friendly Street"" on Myeongmui-gil which connected us to Ewhayeodeae-gil.If you really want to visit the Universities and shop, you need the entire day here. Another way to get here directly is to alight at Ewha Woman University Station, Green line, Exit 2 or 3 and it brings it straight to the main drag where you can find street food. Hair Salons popular with foreigners are Juno Hair, Cecilia, DJ Hair, and Hair clinic. They are also plenty of woman's fashion here at very reasonable prices. One particular shop that sells cosmetics and a whole array of goods that are popular with tourists is Baviphat. They do instant tax refund (cash) on the spot, if you bring your passport along. Even without the tax refund, their prices are much cheaper than Myeongdong & even Namdaemun. If you want to seriously stock up your skincare, cosmetics, and even Korea's famous Honey Butter Almonds, I highly recommend that you hit Baviphat first before shopping in any parts of Seoul !!I finally dyed my hair at DJ Hair Salon (they speak Mandarin more than English). Log on to their free wifi & use the translator to communicate. It was professionally done.  Didn't have time for manicure/pedicure......."
17,4.0,"As it is located near Ewha Women's uni, this area is a shopping haven for young women, although they do have items for men as well. Items here are affordable and trendy, but the style is geared mainly towards young korean women. If you want to do some shopping but are on a tighter budget, this would be one of the places to go."
18,4.0,"it's at ewha women's university station, (green) line 2, exit 2.you can find great deals from skin care, clothing, bags, accessories and many things more, sometimes it's even cheaper than myeongdong and underground shopping malls, since it's at the university area?it's really a shopping heaven!"
19,4.0,"Wanna look like a kpop teenage girl? This place is packed with small shops selling all sorts of cute outfit that is very suitable for young and trendy. If you are looking for office wear or something more formal, then I suggest, giving this place a miss. Afterall, if you wanna look like a student, you will shop at a university town. If you wanna look like an office lady, better off heading to a department store or gangnam/ myeong dong for higher end office wear"
20,4.0,Lovely shopping area with lots of shops and some really nice cafes. Everything is cheaper here cause it's close to a uni but remember to negotiate prices and don't get ripped off
21,4.0,"It is a must go for petite ladies! A lot of affordable fashionable clothing, accessories, bags, phone cases, stationary. There are a few dessert cafes there for you to take a short break before shopping again."
22,3.0,"The fashion street is near the women's university. There's plenty of cheap buys but don't expect them to be of quality. There are many stores that don't allow you to try. So it's buy first and hope for the best. I found the sizes to run small and extra small so it's quite disappointing. Although they are many stores, they seem to sell very similar things."
23,4.0,"Say, expect that the prices are cheaper for the reason that it's near Ewha University. There's really a plethora of choices quite similar to Myeongdong but cheaper. Don't forget the list of things to buy and the budget! Shop, shop 'til you drop! :)"
24,4.0,"I used to be an exchange student at Ewha Womans University, so most of the time spent in that area. First weeks, the street amazed me with the stylish, but not expensive clothes, cosmetics and other different girlish staff, however after some time just realize that in every store all the things are the same with the same prices. All the people who were doing shopping at that stores were wearing absolutely similar clothes, the same colors, shoes, bags etc. Make up stores are good, as with that variety it is possible to find what you really need. All the time there are some promotions and quite often you can receive nice gifts for shopping (or just for visiting the store to check out), and the gifts might be not only samples. If you came to Korea for shopping, but are not willing to pay much money, it is place for you! However, I would suggest to find some well-known brands with better quality and different look.There are also many restaraunts with delicious food. The price is comparatively low as it is place mostly for students."
25,4.0,Away from the hustle and traffic of the likes of Myeongdong and Insadong. Prices here are lesser for the same quality of goods and services! Bought a great pair of leather boots and more skincare from this area. Be prepared to walk-a lot! Bring a trusty Friend who would carry your bags for you! Thankfully mine didn't complain after he's being made to walk 3 hours with me!Plenty of nice cafes to rest your feet here as well!
26,3.0,Maybe early 2000s... here is best fashion street. but now just in front of Ehwa.But Ehwa is nice university. great view.My opinion - Do you know korean fashion? go other street?
27,5.0,Fashion street near ewha university.not very crowded with tourist. Able to find lots of cheap clothes and bags (: must visit olace in seoul !
28,4.0,"Although the streets aren't as crowded as Myeongdong, or as big as Hongdae, its a pretty good place to hang around and shop for clothes and cosmetics. And if you want to take a picture with you're friends or family or your significant other, I recommend you to go to a studio and take it in Ewha Women's University Fashions street (a.k.a Eedae) They have several studio's here and there (I went to a studio that was next to Missha, it's downstairs), and I can guarantee that those photo's will come out beautifully. Also, something you MUST EAT when coming here is Cheese Rice (치즈 밥), there's one next to a shop called 'piercing crow'. The food there is SO good. Whenever I go here, I always stop by and order a Cheese rice. Oh, and last but not least, the best thing about Ewha Woman's University Fashion Street that it's SO CLOSE to Shincheon- another place to visit while in Seoul."
29,5.0,"If you love to shop cheap clothes (but of course with good quality, since you're in korea :p) than you really have to visit this place! Ewha Women's University (Edae) is a very well-known area for its cost-friendly surrounding. You really cant stop once you started to shop here, everything is just too cute and most importantly CHEAP! If you're hungry from your shopping spree, than you can grab a meal also with affordable price. I also heard that you can visit the university building and it's amazingly beautiful. I will make sure that I will come to the building if I have chance to visit Korea again."
30,3.0,"Get ready to bargain and shop girls..! This area is one of the most popular shopping districts in Seoul. The prices are also very cheap compared to shopping at other parts of Seoul since it is targeted at students. Here, you will find a number of stalls lining the streets selling fashion items, such as clothing, shoes and accessories for youngsters. The shops were pretty trendy with a range of tastes and styles. The temptations to spend the money is hard to resist. Luckily i managed to budget my money and only bought a few clothes and a cute pair of shoes ;D We went to coffee shop to grab a cup of good coffee and street food here are not bad too.p/s : Girls, buy your skincare/cosmetics product only at Myeongdong. Its much cheaper!"
31,4.0,"Back after a little over a year and it's still a joy to be there. Friends went crazy over the stalls, especially for the KRW10,000 handbags/backpacks."
32,4.0,"Me and my friend went during the weekend, not wanting to disturb the University students during their normal school hours during the weekday.  We went into the University to take photos and had our lunch at a nearby restaurant.  The University was grand and beautiful and the neigbourhood was with a lot of cafes, small shops selling cosmetics, clothing and accessories.  Girls would love it!  (Please visit during the weekend)"
33,4.0,Wow. I am surprised. I visited this place at night. it is very bautiful and kinda romantic place for a walk. The university is very different then we are used to. Lots of street food.
34,3.0,"There are plenty of stores and restaurants here around the area!! You can always get something cheap and nice in this area, but you just need to check several stores  first and compare the price. There are other places better than this area and you can get a lot cheaper clothes then. Still recommend to come here and walk around the area or just for the food!! Quite a lot of famous restaurants here!!"
35,3.0,We had high hopes for this shopping area and were left disappointed. The shops were not as good as the ones at Hongdae area so skip this place if you have to choose between the 2 shopping areas. Toilets were difficult to find in this area too.
36,5.0,"Another shopping heaven which promises lots of discovery. But seen evidently that there is much more inside this small street. Life can be hilarious but live it. Clothes, shoes and other stuff can be bought at a cheap price which is great. Inside the streets, there are smaller shops which promises a great variety of food."
37,4.0,"Being near a university (and a women’s one no less), the area around it is known as Ewha Woman's University Fashion Street. So expect lots of shops (and departmental stores) selling clothes, accessories, cafés, skincare, beauty salons and shoes – all catered to the preferences of (young) women. One of the plus points about this place is that the products sold here are pretty affordable (with majority of the clientele being students that’s a given). But while the clothes are affordable, the quality of the cloth is literally what you pay for, so don’t expect the clothes that you bought to last you a long time (they just aren’t made that way - well most of them anyways).For more on my experience and photos, please check out my blog: http://www.travelbytez.com/2015/06/a-little-shopping-at-ewha-womens.html"
38,5.0,"Compare to Myeongdong & Dongdaemun that are selling with Korean brands that you are not familiar with , there is really a smoking place for you to shop these trendy fashion which is value for money. The quality and material might not be the best, but it will be something good for a season usage. Highly recommended to spend more of clothes and accessories here."
39,3.0,"Not necessary  a must visit esp for us older folks as target market is  younger people, There are many other shopping streets all over Seoul you can go shopping rather than here. It' s not exactly eq to Tokyo's  Harajuku or Taipei 's Ximenting or Yarra Street in Melbourne or Mongkok  but you can find fashion items, hats, tee shirts, windter clothes, accessories etc . There are a number of stalls along the way offering interest street food. Go ahead try it. hot dog type sausage, roast corn, fish balls etcIt s straight walk on to Erwa Woman University but any left turn will bring you to Fashion St grid of street offering the fashionable items.Not a ""must: visit if you have limited time in Seoul unless you are teenager or young adults."
40,5.0,"Excellent place for street shopping and cafe hopping. Here you can get everything, from caps to contact lens, clothes, bags and shoes.Most of the shops sells things at reasonable prices and they can communicate either in Simple English or Mandarin. Also students of Ewha Women's University will be there to assist foreign speaking tourist if you got lost or needed assistance. This is one of my Must go list in Seoul!!"
41,3.0,"generally selling the same things especially during winter - boots, socks and sweaters. Style of the goods across stores were similar but there were some slashes in prices at most places."
42,5.0,"Shopper’s paradise, offering a wide range of styles and prices. The collection of trendy stores, bars, and delicious cuisine draws out throngs of college students and other freethinkers year-round, making this one of the most creative and energetic places in the city."
43,4.0,"Quite a huge place selling things related to fashion and beauty and delicious food. You can easily spot a few large stores having ongoing sales and selling their clothes at 10,000Won per piece. But qualities and designs are compromised of course, mostly street and casual clothes and less of working attires. There are also better quality and more fashionable pieces around, but at a hefty price tag. However if you are not planning to shop for cheap clothes there, there are many other things to do and it's a place definitely worth looking around! Go for the various famous brands for skincare and cosmetics like The Face Shop, Etude House etc. Skincare and cosmetic products are so much cheaper in Korea!! Or try shopping for cute and affordable stationeries and accessories in Art Box. Food wise there is Chu's Churros, a café selling very very good churros, or try the street food like the egg bread freshly made on the spot. They also have a unique street food where fried chicken, hashbrown and toboki(korean rice cakes) are all mixed together in sweet sauce and topped with mayonnaise, only 1000won for a small cup(they have different sizes). http://poportion.blogspot.sg/2014/08/flew-from-taiwan-to-korea-on-28th-may.html"
44,4.0,"I'll be up-front with my one and only complaint about this place: Their sizes usually run very small, there are usually no fitting rooms and no returns, and they will be very vocal about whether you're too big for their store (I've had shopkeepers turn some of my friends away at the door because they were too big... rude!)If you fit the criteria of a small girl, however, this is the best place to go for cheap and cute fashion.  Not as overwhelming as Myeongdong, but with a great selection.  I always end up coming away with more clothes and bags under 10k won than I bargained for.  There are also some boutiques with better quality clothing, but a still affordable pricetag when compared to other areas in Seoul.The restaurants and cafes with inexpensive food and beverages are a plus, too.  Great way to spend a girls' day out!"
