0,3.0,"as this is still an actual residential area the inside of the house canâ€™t be seen, but it is the interior + exteriors that makes the Hanok ever interesting ... fine other hanok villages that allow you to have a meal in it I.e onion cafe"
1,3.0,It is nice to wonder around. But if you have only a few days....skip it.To may people.....Ok lots of small nice shops.... but as soon as you know you are out of the district. So practical there are just a few nice streets...
2,4.0,there are really beautiful traditional houses originally built by royal family members and noblemen who wanted to be close to the palace.
3,5.0,Feel free to visit this traditional pretty neighborhood right in the heart of Seoul! Of course you have to respect the residents and take a quiet walk through the small streets!
4,5.0,"Bukchon village is a very different kind of experience - puts a smile on your face. Narrow streets with cute houses, very different from other tourist spots one will visit. This is a residential area and these are peoples' homes, so please be respectful and quiet. We are glad we went there."
5,5.0,The village is best accessible by walking from Gyeongbokgung Palace and roaming around the nearby streets. It was a wonderful experience to get lost in the dizzying streets and finally reaching your final destination of Bukchon Hanok.Take your time in roaming around the village away from the tour groups. Best to experience walking around in silence.
6,4.0,"Hanok village is beautiful, you have to be silent because people live there, and obviously quite rich people, so you are not allowed to disturb them ðŸ˜œ"
7,5.0,I loved making the silver pendents the shop is just at the top of this road on the right side. Have a nice wonder enjoy
8,5.0,We enjoyed wandering the streets and also spent one night in a traditional guesthouse.  This had futons on the floor and breakfast was served in a traditional style the next morning.  Well worth the experience.
9,5.0,"This is authentic hanok village, beautiful houses, small restaurants and boutique shops.   However this is a residential area and they don't like tourists."
10,5.0,"If you want to have a glimpse at South Korea's traditional architectural style, visit Buckchon village, with its narrow streets and extremely beautiful houses (hanoks). A piece of advice: since the area is inhabited and since there are lots of tourists coming to this place, try to express your admiration quietly,  not to disturb the residents."
11,5.0,"Difficult to find, but worth the effort, very old, traditional buildings housing small, quirky independent stores and coffee shops, very close to Changdeokgung palace!"
12,3.0,There are family inside the house so keep your big mouth. The government seems to keep this traditional house in the city. I believe the owner of the house is quite rich now because the have nice car and the automatic door complete with cctv around their house. Unfotunately there were some renovations around so I need to choose another corner. There was one open house that you can stop by. There was not any furniture inside but they sell some little gifts.
13,4.0,"I walked here after spending the morning at Gyeongbokgung Palace (amazing, by the way).  The village is full of quiet, steep and winding roads with beautiful private homes, amazing views and interesting things to look at.  Most of the buildings are historic representations of the architecture from many years ago.  If you go on a weekend, you will be delighted to see many people dressed up in period clothing - Iâ€™m told this is a sort of Korean cosplay that has become very popular in recent years."
14,5.0,"You are not visit Seoul if you was not visiting Bukchon Hanok Village. An old village that kept to be its traditional style in the middle of modern city, makes a very great combination and art as well background of Seoul now and then. There are a lot of stores, boutiques, cafes, restaurants that can spoiled your shopping desire to the maximum.Eat lunch or dinner on this area and get the feeling of being local and blend with the environment.If you like, try to wear old traditional costume of South Korea and just walk around on this village. It make you looks like very South Korean people :)"
15,4.0,it is a very nice walk very close to the centerhouses are very well preserved and the overall area is very nice to walk trough
16,4.0,Good to know and see the korean traditional house. Nice place to walk and take photos. Can take a break at the locals opening restaurant there.
17,5.0,This little village set atop a hill takes you back in time and lets you see how civilization was back then
18,3.0,This village is somewhat interesting and offers some nice views over the city. If you are into art then there are plenty of galleries within the village but I didn't really get a quaint feel from it. It's hard to be charmed when you pass by several international stores that are geared towards tourists who like to shop. What happened to the Korean-ness of this place?
19,5.0,"Wonderful attractions of Seoul. understand the history not Korea, Seoul & it's culture. Cultural programs also happens."
20,4.0,"Seoul is one of the most modern megacities in Asia I have come across, also with the least amount of old buildings left. Bukchon is a travel in time. Unfortunately also for the residents it has become a tourist attraction. I spent as much time taking pictures of Chinese tourists posing as viewing old houses."
21,4.0,"Located near the major palaces in north Seoul, this village is free to walk. The streets consist mainly of residences so don't expect much in terms of shopping. Yido pottery and KwangJuYo Pottery are nearby if you want the best in Korean ceramics, however."
22,4.0,This fascinating area of Seoul is on the tourist route and demonstrates some of the earlier Korean way of living and architecture.  Well worth a visit.
23,5.0,I had couple of hours before I leave for my flight. I went there. Nice place to see. You can see how the historical houses are and they are still residential and some of tgem renovated. Worth to see if you are close.
24,5.0,"Loved this place. Real authentic and lots a photo ops. Many small shops and restaurants, traditional houses. Excellent tea houses here and there. Bukchon was the highlight of my Seoul trip."
25,5.0,"We had a really lovely walk around this village! I love all the traditional houses so much. We did have a talk with owners of E-oot hanok, they are super nice and friendly! A good option for those who want to experience ""night in a traditional hanok"" when in Seoul - they even offer cooking class by the owner herself!"
26,4.0,"I was visiting Seoul on business and wanted to experience some traditional culture- not easy when you are working all day. My colleague and I took a taxi to visit Bukchon village around 6:30 pm. At this time of day it was quiet and calm. We encountered very few other visitors. We could leisurely explore the beautiful homes and quaint walking streets. The air was cool and breezy- so refreshing after a hot day of trains and taxis. The only downside was that most stores were already closed. At this time, you need just 1/2 hour to 45 mins to explore this area which makes it possible to do at the end of the work day. Then you can easily walk 15 mins. to Insedong for dinner."
27,5.0,"This is a must see if you want to see the traditional Korean house.  Beautiful area where you can enjoy shopping, unique shops and food.  A nice way to spend half a day enjoying the views and food."
28,5.0,"This was very nice rest for me in this place. A lot of interesting architecture buildings, beautifull park with a lot of flowers and green leaves. Nice introduction of Korean history for me and nice rest in this rush city. I recomand this place for visit and spent nice time."
29,4.0,"I got time to visit this place. It is a culture hub and intend to share it with those that visit the place. While all the houses are privately owned, some owners opens the place and share the unique Korean culture, art and crafts. There are also several homestays for tourist that wanted more in-depth look at Korean culture."
30,5.0,If you want to see old houses in modern city yoy have to visit this kind of skanzen we call it. But houses here are living ones.
31,5.0,"I had one free day during my business trip in Seoul and decided that I wanted to see the traditional Hanok village and I was happy I decided to go there after the visit at the Palace. It was a lovely neighborhood to take a leisure walk, cute little coffee shops and local noodle shop there."
32,3.0,Can see the original house of how they stay way back till now maintaining the same structure.Be sure you are quite cos they are actually stay inside the houses
33,5.0,"There are a lot of things to visit, you will see the traditional korean's house and very friendly people at that village."
34,5.0,This was a neat little area of town with some great houses. Cool old neighborhood. Great restaurants near there also. Hiked to the top and checked out a lot of the houses. Definitely recommend seeing this area.
35,4.0,"Bukchon Hanok village is an old neighborhood in Seoul located between the two royal palaces.  This is a great walking area of town, with narrow, winding streets and traditional architecture.  Mind the people holding the ""Shhhh"" signs :-)  You really are walking through a residential neighborhood.  At the top of the hill, on the east side of the walking tour part of the neighborhood, is wonderful, small ""souvenir"" shop, barely large enough for the proprietor and two patrons.  The Korean shop keeper was so nice, able to communicate in English enough to help me buy a couple of gifts for my family.  Within the village are some great traditional Korean restaurants too!"
36,5.0,"Absolutely love it! A must place to go. As an architect, I really appreciate the traditional style of buildings which were built to perfection."
37,5.0,"This is a must see area to get a feel for how beautiful the Korean housing was in the era before then concrete and steel apartment building.  It is easy to get to, is very walkable (although hilly) and has nice local shops with crafts and food.  It has become popular with Chinese tour groups so best to go during the week vs, weekends."
38,5.0,Lots of old-style houses and shops on very narrow and hilly streets; make sure you get the map of the neighborhood at the Bukchon Heritage Center.
39,5.0,"Once you have visited Gyrongbok palace, consider walking toward Bukchon which literally mens Northern Town. It is full of small shops and eateries with the glimpse of home stay in a traditional Korean housing. In the house stay, there are no beds. Instead, a floor is provided much like when one goes to camping but more luxurious and comfortable way. I did not stay but walked into a house to get information."
40,5.0,"This was one of my favorite spots in Seoul. Traditional houses, good restaurants and great shopping."
41,5.0,"Beautiful historic area in Seoul, and a contrast to the rest of the modern city. Try to go early morning, or around sunset to get as few tourists around you. A few houses let you in for a small fee. Lonely Planet guides have a good walking map of the area."
42,4.0,Visited in July16. Will require lot of walking to cover entire village. Pick up a map from info booth right at start of village that wil show the best route you can cover. You can see Traditional homes here and they look beautiful.
43,5.0,Beautifully preserved old houses that are still being lived in. Some of the owners have used the location of their homes to offer tourists stunning views of the Seoul skyline (they charge and entrance fee). Worth walking through these several streets. On the weekend you can see young Koreans dressed in traditional customs walking around.
44,5.0,"The traditional local homes are very unique. Some homes even offer home stays to experience the Korean culture. Nice neighbourhood.If you are there in the evening, do try to catch the view of the sunset with the city buildings as a backdrop. Do observe their rules - be quiet as it is a residential area."
45,5.0,"I had an outdoor Korean BBQ dinner here and it was so cool, yummy too, just steps from this advertisement photo"
46,4.0,"Quiet and charming, this is such a beautiful cultural village with wonderful clean streets and nice shops along the way. I definitely recommend here as to myeongdong and since it is opposite of Anguk and Invading and smack in between the two top palace in Seoul, this makes a wonderful stop"
47,4.0,Seoul as it once was.  This is a touristic place but still worth the effort of visiting.  Book a guide to get an insight into the lives of the people who still live here.
48,4.0,the strees of Bukchon give you glimspe of real Korean Culture. get a trail map from any of the shops in the street and walk through the trail. You can see the traditional Korean houses and on the way visit multiple Korean arts and painting centers. You can also take Korean painting lessons for 45 minutes. We were lucky that one of the residents was kind enough to welcome us to their house and show us around. The lay out of Korean Houses are very different and interesting.
49,5.0,"Let's all face it.  Seoul is a gritty city not the least of which is the continuous smog and particulates (not to mention the seasonal flows of yellow dust from the Gobi) - albeit air quality is still better than highly populated Chinese cities.  Once you've recovered from a long evening of neon lights and clubs, there must be something else.  Yes, you got it; it's Bukchon.  Only last year did I discover, via an offer for a weekend sightseeing afternoon from a native Seoulite, this quaint urban village after many years of business travel to Seoul.  I think that most hotels will quickly send you to Insadong, which is fine.  But it is largely craft shops on a single street without the diversity provided by Bukchon.  Here you will find craft and designer shops sandwiched in among restaurants and coffee shops.  The terrain is interesting too in that the roads wind and climb little hillocks.  There are trees lining streets and Samcheong park is nearby for a stroll or a 1/2 day hike around the old Seoul city wall.  Shared walled houses and B&Bs and curved roofs covered in tiles are a unique site in a city of largely concrete and glass.  Take my advice and go there."
50,4.0,"I used to live here until last year and I chose this area because its charm of traditional feeling and small cute stores around the town. Well, the first demolition happened a decade ago in terms of construction, then the second demolition in its personality is on the way. I would say even for that short 3 years of my staying there, I've witnessed more than 50% of my favorite stores including small handmade shops, real cafÃ©s, local restaurants had been replaced by worldwide or local super power franchises. This was really frustrating and became a reason to leave the town... I still give 4 stars though because there are yet some survivors struggling against the push of landlords and also there are beautiful narrow hidden alleys all around the corners. Just avoid the main road and super chains if possible if you want the real town coming slowly back to us."
51,4.0,"Personally, I went to Bukchon for the hanok style houses. I found them less impressive than the glossy photos in the Bukchon brochure, let alone they are hard to find! Having said that the quarter is very charming and I loved the little restaurants that are tucked away in all those little alleys. Best to go there late afternoon so you can take a few pictures and then have proper Korean dinner."
52,5.0,"Definitely a must-visit! Been to Seoul twice in 2016, and went to Bukchon area four times - just beautiful. We had a walking tour the first time, and went back to dine and walk around more. A place suitable for families, the romantic and just friends hanging out."
53,5.0,The old buildings are well maintained and offer a fascinating contrast to the very modern city centre.
54,2.0,Went with high expectations and well after a walk from the nearest station of about 10 mins reached the place . . kept on wondering what was there to see apart from small lanes and old houses . .  only go if you have nothing else to see :)
55,3.0,"At least during winter time not very special place, you can access differetn small scale museums with small money and there are some handicraft shops, but during cold vinter day area is pretty quiet. The old building are nice anyway, something not easy to find elsewhere in Seoul."
56,5.0,"Because of a few mistakes in planning, we ended up spending an afternoon here, and were so glad we did. This is a hidden gem that most visitors on short visits won't get to as it takes some effort and walking. Beautiful architecture, interesting back story, lovely one-off shops and Doo Roo, an exquisite non-chain coffee bar that's so toasty and cozy!"
57,4.0,"This village preserves the old shapes of Korea in the era of Joseon Dynasty. Also, there are lots of restaurants specilazed in dishes, cafes, galallies, etc.. Go to there if you want to see Kirean cultures. There are lots of foreigners getting around."
58,4.0,"I had a quick walk through Bukchon village at night in Seoul.  My intention was to return again in the daylight, but even in the evening, it was beautiful, and gives a glimpse into the past.  The narrow streets and old, well restored houses are a delight to see."
59,5.0,"If you love those scene in Korean TV series, you should not miss this place. You can easily spent your entire day exploring this place, shop to shop, cafe to cafe, etc. Be prepared to wear your comfortable shoe as the terrain there can be quite challenging for some. But the amount of food intake and easily burn-off at teh end of the day. Beautiful place. Must allocate time for this."
60,5.0,Walking around the small street of Bukchon is a must when visiting Seoul. It one of the only few remaining locations where you could see the traditional houses.
61,5.0,Walking the streets and looking at all of the old historic houses was really neat. I'm glad I just so happen to stumble across this as I was exploring the city of Seoul.
62,3.0,A long established neighborhood of traditional Korean architecture nestled within site of the modern high rises of Seoul.  Visiting Bukchon allows one to experience and appreciated the materials and style of yesterday's Korea.  Very nice and upscale shops and galleries are sprinkled throughout the area.
63,5.0,Bukchon is a small traditional area located an easy subway trip from central Seoul. It is famous for the traditional wooden houses that are dotted around the area. It is also the home to the Prime Minister of Korea - although his house is rather more grand. The area is great for a pleasant stroll so that you can take in the sights and also create some great photos of the old houses with Seoul's rising skyline in the background. There is a small tourist office which provides a free walking map - not the best map in the world admittedly - however it's enough to show you where the main photo opportunities are and enough to get you back on track when you inevitably get lost around the myriad tiny alleyways.The area is however quite hilly in parts so perhaps not suitable for all travellers. There are also a couple of palaces nearby although I didn't get the chance to visit - from a distance however they looked impressive.
64,5.0,We went here on our last day and so glad we did. We spent approximately 4 hour strolling through the lane ways and walking into the traditional shops. We found lovely secluded coffee shops along the way which we had some wonderful iced coffee to cool ourselves down. Take some good walking shoes as climbing the hills is a must. You get to look down on the traditional roofs. If you follow the signs they will lead you to where you can obtain a map which marks out the walking routes to follow. Of course we got totally lost and went our own way but that is half the fun! Again there are more shops and some that specialised in arts and crafts. One of the highlights of our trip.
65,5.0,Its Nice if you were to visit early mornings otherwise this place swell by noon time with large crowd of Camera touting tourist from all over the world !! Wonderful Traditional Houses You must look out for the Old Quiant corner where you find traditional simple food is being served !! Delicious
66,4.0,this village is located in the city and can see lots of students do their activities here ..nice view ...
67,4.0,"Thoroughly enjoyed wandering around the neighbourhood, with its traditional korean wooden houses, some original, others restored. Most of old seoul was destroyed either by the japanese or by the civil war somthis gives youna glimpse what seoul must have looked like. Take a map from the tourist office or the information guides posted around the area to help you navigate your way around."
68,5.0,"one of the best places in Seoul to visit on a lazy afternoon durin winter.If you're into nostalgic and quaint-stuff, then Bukchon Village is the ideal place to visit."
69,5.0,"Just like some of parts of Tokyo, I love the low rise, old neighbourhoods that have been renovated  but have kept the charm of an Old Seoul Village.  It's walkable, and a lovely combination of the old with new shops and cafÃ©s.  Charming!"
70,5.0,Very pleasant stroll around the alleys and neighbourhood.  The Customs and arts are excellent.  People are very nice.  I dined in a couple of traditional Korean Restaurants in the neighborhood and they are very delicious and reasonably priced.
71,4.0,"The Bukchon village is a residential area and while we go around walking about the rows and rows of well-preserved (if not, designed & constructed) hanok style houses, we were reminded to keep noise at a minimum in order not to disturb the families that live there. You don't want a tourist peering into your house, do you? Enjoy the sights and photograph all you want but give respect to the privacy of families that reside there.  We descended at Samcheondong for some food and drinks and to rest our legs."
72,3.0,"I went because I had wanted to see a ""traditional Korean village"" and a friend had recommended it to me. I had me imagined a model village for tourists to see what traditional style Korean houses look like. However, upon arriving at Bukchon, it turned out to be a neighbourhood that happen to have a lot of traditional style Korean houses with real people living there in. The neighbourhood is on a hillside and so a lot of places it's quite steep. You also get some pretty amazing views and there is also an observatory that you can go to.  Go in the day time so you can see the views. There are volunteer tourist guides all around that supply you with a map of the places to see in the area. Also just down the road there are some really good and inexpensive restaurants. There are some cute shops, cafes, and restaurants tucked in unexpected places."
73,4.0,"It is a very tight place to navigate around as a tall person, and the streets would not be good if crowded, but people are still living in these places that are hundreds of years old and incredibly basic. I went mid week, and found a local guide for a few dollars who gave me a good and informative tour in English.  After the megalopolis of Seoul and Gangnam, it is a simple and lovely space and a quick visit."
74,5.0,The neighborhood has home with old korean architecture. Stays open from 10 am to sunset. Nearby (betweem Bukchon and Seoul Museum of Modern Art) is a small market with quaint shops and eateries. Do have this place on your itinerary!
75,5.0,"I'm really impress with this place. Walking along this road, seems I were in Korean drama.At Gahoe-dong Alley, You can see the traditional Korean houses along with modern buildings and N Seoul Tower as the background. he traditional Korean houses are still inhabited by residents. You can catch a glimpse of residents' day-to-day life. The contrast of modern life and traditional building is the best point of this place, burglar alarms at the wall of traditional houses and modern cars.(People who live here must be great at driving because the alleys are so twisty. I think it is really amazing ! )You can enjoy nice and antique cafes and galleries alone the ways also. It takes a few hours to walk all areas but it's worth."
76,3.0,Got here on a stroll from Insa-Dong down the road and behind the Constitutional CourtIts a quaint place and has some very well maintained (though recently renovated) old Korean houses.It was a Thursday evening and the roads were deserted and I enjoyed walking in the narrow alleyways between these houses -  This maybe the only photo-op a short stay Seoul visitor may get of Old Style Seoul/Korea. There is a walking tour route available with a clearly marked path.
77,4.0,"Quaint little houses and streets, somewhat akin to old Korea (although also somewhat touristy). Certainly worth going for."
78,4.0,We visited on a Saturday morning. Very interesting to see a traditional Korean upscale neighborhood that dates back centuries but still functions as a residential area. Worth the 1-2 hours to stroll
79,5.0,"This is a neat area, with an older feel, to walk around in.  Just take a stroll, grab a meal and do a little shopping, including a nice chocolate shop!"
80,5.0,"What a great area â€“ narrow winding streets, small cafÃ©s, art galleries, quirky little craft shops, and brave souls living like the Koreans of old in Hanoks. Sandwiched between the palaces to the east and west, and the narrow streets of Insadong to the south filled with bars and restaurants, Bukchon is a taste of Korea that you are not going to get staying in a large hotel tower.If you can't stay, go for a walk through the streets, try some soju at the cultural centre, or marvel at the restoration work underway on the houses."
81,5.0,This is really an interesting part of Seoul. Get a map from the information center and head north towards Bukchon. The left side part which is Hanok is much more interesting. We really enjoyed the twisting streets and the narrow alleys and of course the traditional houses with very low roofs. There is an observation point where one can have a magnificent view of the surrounding mountains and the Gyeongbokgung palace. Nice antique and art shops specially the one close to the main entrance to Hanok village (check the photo attached)
82,4.0,Enjoyed walking through Bukchon. The houses are traditional and historical but are occupied and updated in terms of front and garage doors. Would love to see inside the homes. Walked past one where the owner was installing an outdoor light fixture and could see the modern conveniences through the open gate (yes; I was looking). Fantastic view at the top of the street. Stand on top of the cement clock/cornerstone at dusk. Beautiful! Loved the character and feel of the neighborhood. Worth a look!
83,4.0,An active neighborhood of traditional architecture. The view down from the hill looking at the rooftops of the old buildings is interesting. It was easy to get to with the subway.
84,4.0,"interesting architecture, small modest museums, and craft displays.  Bring a map (available free at tourist center) so you don't get lost."
85,5.0,"I visited Bookchon Twice. When I visited Bookchon on Monday, the main street of bookchon was a bit quiet and not many people around. It was quite enjoyable for me and my friend to walk around Bookchon area. The only problem was the Bookchon Information Office was closed on that day. Fortunately we met two Bookchon tour guides, who provided us with a proper tour map and explained to us how to reach the lane with many traditional Korean houses. Finally we found the lane and had many photo taken in front of a traditional Korean main door. When we were about to leave the lane, a group of Chinese tourists with a guide turned up. It appears that the lane is quite famous. On the way back to the main street, we found ""KKok-doo museum"". I was fascinated by the exibition, Ã¤lthough the museum is a branch of ""main KKok Doo museum"" located in Haewha-dong. Even so, the exibition items at ""KKokdoo museum at Bookchon"" was facinating. I read a newspaper article before that KKokdoo had an exhibition in London. ""KKokdoo is a human shape craft, which decorated coffin in Chosun Dynasty. In Bookchon area, there are many shops and restaurants decorated by creative designs. I bought many souveniers, including magnets, books and Korean traditional design post-its. I want to visit Bookchon again at my next visit Seoul. This time, I will visit Bookchon perhaps Tuesday. I would like to visit museums and galleries at Bookchon.Tip - Certainly Bookchon is a facinating place to visit, if you like traditional Korean style. Monday looks to be the best day of a week to visit Bookchon, if you want a quiet environment. The only drawback of visiting Bookchon on Mondays is the fact that many galleries and museums at Bookchon and near Bookchon are closed on Mondays. I visited on Saturday and surprised at the crowd. The Bookchon main street was packed by so many people Saturday afternoon."
86,3.0,"I had a difficult time finding the more scenic areas here and became rather frustrated.  There are however many great shops and cafes in the area.  I'm glad I took the time to do this, but I was looking for something more than just another shopping area in Seoul."
87,4.0,"This might be a little hard to find, and many might not find it worth it after you see it, but it's very interesting to see this traditional housing and how they are built."
88,4.0,"When we were walking along Bukchon (the start of which is about 500meters from the Anguk Station exit 2), you start to feel that you really are in Korea as you see the traditional houses around you. We went there during the weekend and there were some very helpful tourist guides stationed in certain areas to direct you to the different spots with the best views."
89,4.0,The Korean tourist office put out an excellent walking map of this area - do the walk late afternoon and stay on for dinner in Samcheong
90,4.0,Go at various times of the day if you can - the light in the late afternoon is lovely and then stop at a roof top restaurant for dinner - lots to chose from
91,3.0,"Just like much of the old Korean architecture, most of Seoul was destroyed in the Korean war and in rebuilding, several areas were rebuilt to dimensions of the old style villages that Seoul originally began as. There are a plethora of small shops, museums and art centers. Weekends are the time to visit, as the areas are residential and more are open on the weekends. Interesting, but not more then other Korean sites."
92,5.0,"go there on sundays. walk around, shop for great souvenirs, food and delights, rest in a coffee shop, buy great tea to bring home. don't forget your camera."
93,5.0,"This wonderful oasis of quiet in a bustling city features reconstructed traditional Korean houses, demonstrations of Korean hand crafts, such as basket and shoe making, Korean dancing (check times for shows on bulletin board at village), and a shop selling art work and a bit-better-than-average souvenirs. We did not take the free walking tour offered by Seoul Tourism; however, we had been to other traditional villages throughout S. Korea, and could make comparisons. If your visit is only to Seoul, I'd recommend this village as a good place to see how Koreans lived in the past.  There are some steps at this village but also wide, open spaces where wheelchairs can go (albeit a bit bumpily). It's not a huge place, so walking should not be a problem."
94,4.0,"Really nice pedestrianized area with examples of traditional Korean architecture and crafts. Good coffee shops, very friendly people."
