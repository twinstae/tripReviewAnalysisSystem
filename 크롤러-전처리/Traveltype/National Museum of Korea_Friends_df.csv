0,5.0,We visited to this museum in the morning so we had a chance to catch the English speaking guided tour. It was interesting and even outside of the museum there are lots of things to explore.
1,5.0,Wonderful place to visit. Worthwhile experience. Very well explained exhibits and easy to follow explanations
2,5.0,Nice place to explore! This large area with many historical things is great for knowing better korean history.
3,5.0,"Very interesting museum. Tons of information and details. Great place to learn more about Korean history. I was jet lagged so could not fully enjoy this place. But I recommend to plan at least 2-3 hours to explore. In addition there is an amazing space in front of the entrance, or rather between the entrances. With a beautiful view to Namsan (sp?). See the photo."
4,5.0,"Beautiful place, tastefully designed to remember and educate. It was quite emotional but very deserving. Learn and never forget!"
5,5.0,I love this museum you will learn and appreciate korean culture and historyIt displayed Other south east asian countries artifactsFree admissionHas 3 floors and an indoor activity
6,5.0,Free!  Large collection of artifacts and free tours.  If you don’t have time or just don’t to do a tour download the free app for a self guided tour.
7,5.0,"We spent about 2 hours at the museum, though you can easily spend a lot more time. We did not do the audio tour, but we did do a guide tour (in English) that lasted about an hour and highlighted some of the National Treasures in the museum.  The guide spoke very good English and was very knowledgeable.  We definitely recommend doing a guided tour if you can arrange to visit when they are available.  The guided tour, like the rest of the museum, is free.  Be  sure to save time to explore the beautiful grounds outside the museum as well.  If you are doing the free guided tour, then I would say give yourself 2 hours minimum at the museum, though we could have spent more time there if we had more time to spare."
8,4.0,Such a nice spacious museum. Lots of artefacts/ statues/ some furniture. Wish there was more artwork.Very clean facilities.
9,4.0,Took advantage of the free English speaking guide. She was knowledgeable and interesting but had an extremely soft voice so it was difficult to hear. Lovely building and interesting exhibits. Easy to get to on the Metro and well worth a visit.
10,5.0,"I have never seen such a huge museum before, I'm not abig fan of museums, but this one really is impressive. Not only that is big (make shure to give it half a day at least) but it is also well organized and interesting. It has a beautiful lake and garden in front of it and also a restaurant. I spent there my last day in Seoul and it was all worth it."
11,5.0,"This is a flagship museum that offers many aspects of Korean history. The museum is located at Yongsan area, can be accessed by mRT and stop at Ichon Station Exit 2, walking 150m. The museum also has a separate museum for children with fee. The rest is free of charge."
12,5.0,After a week of touring South Korea I was wondering where I might see some treasures. This is the place. The museum is extremely large and beautifully done. Every piece has an explanation or at least a title in English. The collection is amazing and very well displayed. It is super easy to get there on the subway.
13,4.0,"We ended our visit on a Thursday (late night at the Museum) at the Pagoda restaurant.  My friends all opted for the  prix fixe menus (Korean and Italian) and thoroughly enjoyed.  I decided on something different, the octopus bibimbop - and thoroughly enjoyed. It was more like a deconstructed bibimbop  with the rice on the side, to be added.  A really good variation on a traditional dish"
14,5.0,Beautiful building with a large collection. Over the last ten years I have paid multiple visits to this museum and find myself returning to it often. The pictures I uploaded are from the temporary Goryeo exhibition in 2019
15,5.0,"Short walk from the subway station. Easy to find. A lot of stuff to see and you really get a good picture of Korean history. Remember to grab a map before you explore the exhibitions, so you won' get lost. The museum itself is really pretty and the architecture is wonderful. The view at the top is also cool! Has lockers where you can put your stuff during the visit.The museum was almost too interesting as I found myself walking around the building for the third hour."
16,5.0,about a 5 minutes walk from the subway station. the experience along this walk was quite impressive! admission to the museum is free so that's even better! signages are in english and overall easy to walk around in the museum
17,4.0,And I was very impressed by the Silla artifacts. There were 3 special exhibitions at that time which I was not able to explore.
18,5.0,"Lovely surrounds and beautiful colleciton. I spent many hours here.  Aside from a lot of loud and boisterous schoolkids, it was nevertheless enjoyable."
19,5.0,"During our visit, a special outdoor exhibition of traditional dance and music was preformed at the outdoor amphitheater, which was an unexpected added attraction to a very interesting museum. Two special exhibits plus the museum’s 3 floors of Korean art and artifacts kept us busy for several hours."
20,5.0,"A place where history and art meet together It's definitely worth the visit , well arranged, places to eat and relax after you view the artwork I like it"
21,5.0,"I loved this visit, as I was impressed by the view of the museum both inside and outside.  Nice and informative and a good outdoor area to take pictures of military hardware like missiles."
22,4.0,"Good place to get to know about Korea's history well arranged, equipped and maintained take a tour and enjoy the visit"
23,4.0,"Need at least an hour. Ground floor is interesting with the history of Korea, otherwise 70% of the exhibition just all pottery....train station n bus nearby. It’s free  but special exhibition is charged at 9000+"
24,5.0,By this museum we can learn and understand about korean people. We can take the photo inside the museum but not alllowed to using flash
25,4.0,Large museum with lots to see.  We spent a whole afternoon here.  Easy to get to on the underground.  The Buddhas were fantastic.  Also has a great outdoor garden area.
26,5.0,"It was our last day in Seoul and our trip was in the afternoon. Since we have been shopping and food tripping for 3 days, it was about time to learn some history. Very impressive building, informative, and entrance is free. It’s a must see before you leave Seoul."
27,5.0,The place is beautiful! i have been there twice and I still feel in awe with the beauty.  the collections are nice.
28,4.0,"My only problem was that the day we went, it was filled with school kids. Still had a good time but will  go again."
29,4.0,"We visited the National museum of Korea on a Sunday. The place was crowded. The museum was a 3 levels place. The 1st floor was all about history and the 2-3 were all about culture and art. The Brochure was available in Korean, English and Arabic. The museum was worth the visit, every corner was well maintained and every item was well taken care off. You will surely need to visit it for yourself.  There was a nice and cosy café on the 3rd floor. I had my favorite mixed grains cold drink with rice cookie.  The drink was nutritious and cold.  SEE photos."
30,5.0,"I won't tell anything but suggest all to come here visit and get yourself to learn about the country. Cool place, one of the must-go"
31,4.0,"The National Museum of Korea is connected to the Ichon Station (Line 4) and a comfortable walk both to the museum and within the museum. While it is a big location with multiple artefacts to keep you occupied, I will first warn that most of the permanent exhibits are of art and archaeological digs, making the museum cover more about what Korea was hundreds/thousands of years ago more so than what South Korea is now. If that is what you want to see, then the Museum is a great place to be in, otherwise I suggest you take the time to explore Seoul's other museums/districts which would talk more about people's present lives.Otherwise, its free and an appropriate location for wet weather. There are also special exhibitions you can pay for and the National Hangeul Museum in close vicinity so you can easily spend a few hours here."
32,5.0,"Three friends and I visited the National Museum of Korea after spending about a week studying the Korean War, and we all walked away really glad we spent most of our day here. After covering Korean history from 1949-1953, roughly, we felt like we had a much better understanding of Korean history as a whole, and loved the range and depth that the exhibits here offered. I know the artwork was also worth seeing, but I confess that we were ""museum-ed out"" by the point we hit the art (we spent about 3 hours going through the history exhibits on the first floor alone) that we more or less strolled through, stopping only at the works that really caught our eye. One could easily spend a few hours or a day here and it would be well worth it."
33,3.0,"If you don't read Korean and are not familiar with Korean history, this is going to be complicated. I walked through it but it wasn't engaging for me."
34,5.0,Museum has quite a collection of the emperors' history with beautiful drawings of emperors' parades and how they lived. There is a small gift shop on the premises which one can buy some Korean items at reasonable prices. The antique cars were beautiful
35,5.0,Well organized exhibitions and very spacious and beautifully designed museum . Beautiful grounds surrounding the entire space.
36,5.0,An insightful look into the development of Korea over the ages. Admission is free for the main hall. Worth a visit.
37,5.0,"Go!  I mean it. All the museums in South Korea were amazing and I went to at least 15 of them. This museum is very well done with English explanations and a free English audio guide (you must leave an ID to borrow the guides so bring your drivers license). While there were no children in my group, I saw lots of groups of children and they had plenty of activities and ways to keep them interested. This museum really helped me to understand the history of Korea and its culture. We spent at least 3 hours in the museum, it just depends on your pace.  I would highly recommend going to the National Museum of Korea."
38,5.0,Permanent exhibitions is Free.Admission is required for special exhibitions.But The special exhibition impressed me!I RECOMMEND it!Please refer to it.I downloaded a 10% discount coupon from Baynaru. :)Good for you!
39,5.0,Its free. Very informative of their rich culture. Just in front of the museum is another place for you to visit..
40,5.0,"Because this is a national museum, it is completely free. Free lockers are also nice to stow your coat, bags, etc. Korea is so low on crime I even leave my purse in the locker without worry. Very interesting displays and art. Not a lot in English, as with most museums in Seoul. But this museum is one of my favorite Seoul museums."
41,5.0,"To get a sense of the Kdrama you have been watching, it's good to get educated on the history. So explore the museum and its surrounding. Beautiful place to get instagrammable photos too!"
42,5.0,This place was our last stop of our Seoul visit. I found it convenient because not only was the entrance free but it was actually worth your time. It's a three storey building with many rooms to enlightened yourself on South Korea's history and culture. Allocate 2 hours of your time because 1 hour isn't enough time to cover the area.
43,5.0,This is a great place to learn about Korean history and artwork. The museum is very large and modern with all signs in English too. And it's free! We only had about an hour to wander around which isn't nearly enough. Be sure to dedicate some time to this place.
44,3.0,"The best bit is the building itself - as another reviewer wrote ""a museum of space"".  It is simply cavernous, and worth a visit in itself.  Like most Korean museums it's also free.  But where are the contents?The ground floor contains the findings of numerous tomb digs - well-preserved and beautifully presented.  My favourite object was a Roman glass jug: think on how that got to Korea 2000 years ago, but sit down first as your mind will begin to spin on what something that fragile had to go through to survive the trip.Upstairs are numerous collections of ceramics: most donated and of really high quality and, again, beautifully displayed.The down side is that, unless ceramics really are a core interest of you this museum doesn't have much to see.  Sorry, but it's even a bit dull.  I visited several museums during my visit and, I fear, they have spread the jam too thin"
45,4.0,"Nice museum, you can learn not only Korean history but also other Asian countries history. There are also some lounge for you to take a rest, and the lounge is totally nice."
46,4.0,"The museum covers a lot of art and artifacts through the prehistoric era all the way up to the end of Korean Empire with the occupation by the Japanese. The museum is very large, and has a very large small pond. The museum is free, however there are small sections in the museum that charge. Inside the main museum is a restaurant, and outside within the museum grounds has a convenience store, and coffee shop.No shortage of restrooms either."
47,5.0,"Renting headphones probably would had been helpful to fully appreciate all the information to be learned at this museum  It was modern and well laid out and even though it was crowded, it was not hard to get around.  The Gift Shop had the best quality items for souvenirs and gifts."
48,4.0,The museum welcoming us by providing a large open space. This is a big museum with many exhibitions and collections so I suggest you prepare to spend your time here minimum half a day.
49,5.0,Went there with friends after few days of meeting. Able to learn and understand the Koreans history without admission fess. Easy to access through subway and very well maintained and offered multi languages sign board. Recommended for those intend to know Korea better.
50,4.0,You can see  Korean ancient  history in various aspects here. The architectural building is surrounded by a spacious comfortable garden. It is conveniently connected with subway.
51,4.0,"If you're alone and nothing to do, this is the thing for you to do. There's a few sections in this museum, but I'd say the hanguel museum is the best, interactive and very informative. It's free! It's accessible by metro! Just right outside the station. Forgot which one, sorry!"
52,5.0,I like this museum because of its size and number of exhibitions. It is massive and a good place to visit together with War memorial museum. They are near by and easily accessible by public transportation in Yongsan area.
53,4.0,Informative and very interesting to learn more about Korea in this museum. Best part about this is that it's free and open to all!
54,5.0,"Not only the museum building is magnificent, the exhibits were wonderful too. There were two signature exhibition on Arabian and French fashion when I was there - I enjoyed it alotThe food court in the museum served good standard food, and I loved the museum shop.A must go for all travellers who are in Seoul, Korea"
55,4.0,"While in Seoul it is considered one of the places you should pay a visit to. Interesting architecture, nice floor plan a bit limited exhibits collection, but overall nice place."
56,4.0,The museum is very modern and easy to get to. I would say the exhibits that were available weren't as good as the ones back in Canada.
57,5.0,It is the one of the biggest museum in the world. There are various historical art facts of Korea and some other arts of Asia. You can put your belongings in a locker for 100 won. Prepare a coin.
58,5.0,You could easily spend several days here and still not see everything. Don't pass this gem up.  And it is free.
59,5.0,"This is a museum that impressed me by far in Seoul. On three floors and logically divided, everything on display is beautifully arranged. Once you are in the museum, you are immersed in the history of Korea and Asia while it doesn't let you go. You are so immersed in a visual experience, that you loose track of time. Entrance is free of charge and that surprised me, since the interior and everything on display is really outstanding and well organized. Awesome!!!"
60,5.0,"For first time tourists, this is a must see. Artifacts and history lesson in a building that is amazing itself. Nice walk outside as well."
61,3.0,"We expected to find information on the modern time, but we only found two floors with ancient history. The building is beautiful and the garden a nice place to relax."
62,5.0,"A fantastic museum set in a really beautiful, huge building on grounds with a lot of green and a big reflecting pool.  The museum is free and great for all ages.  The first floor spans the history of Korea – from around 2000 BCE up to the present day. The upper floors have more concentrated collections, or individual collections of donors. There are excellent descriptions for the art and some really thoughtful and interesting layouts (sometimes showing how pieces were found or excavated, or laying out in drawing or simple metal work what the rest of a boat or statue would look like if still complete).  We easily spent three hours and we didn’t even make it to the top floor.  I was also really impressed by the interactive elements they had for visitors who were visually impaired with replicas of some of the major works to be felt with accompanying braille descriptions. I also saw a lot of children on field trips, and it looks like the museum had created interactive guides for kids.  The museum is right off of the Inchon Station"
63,5.0,"The museum is fairly new and huge. Visiting here will help you to understand history and culture of Korea. Make sure to stop by the museum shop at the end, it's the best place to buy pretty souvenirs, that you can't find outside of the museum, good quality and super cute, at reasonable prices."
64,4.0,I went there for craftwork classes and that palce is amazing. It brings the old and the new in its architeture. Everything there makes it worth it.
65,3.0,Well we took a tour to see Seoul's major attractions and this is one of them. Lot of displays about Korean culture their history and practices of the past. It was fun.
66,4.0,"An impressive building and an impressive collection of Korean artefacts and details of Korean history. Laid out over three floors there was also an eclectic collections of items donated by local artists. The museum also has special exhibitions from time to time, but unfortunately we did not have time to see the current one on Egypt. Easily found with the Seoul City tour bus stopping outside the main entrance. Lots to see and could easily spend a full day if you took your time looking at all the exhibits.  Would be good for a rainy day and it's free entry, with a helpful leaflet in most major languages should you be limited for time and want to see the main exhibits."
67,5.0,This museum is a must to learn about Korean culture and history. The gift shops offers interesting items at a reasonable price. The restaurant outside of the museum entrance has good food much cheaper than inside the museum. We returned to this museum in our limited time in Seoul because it was THAT GOOD!
68,5.0,"If you really want to know about korean, this is the best place for you to visit. If you want to know how south korean and north korean split, come and visit this place. You will never get boring."
69,5.0,Well this is the type of place that a museum addict love. This museum is huge (6 floor FYI). With around 15.000 collections. Maybe I need to come more than twice to get to know every collection in here. This museum open from 9 am to 9 pm and free admission for permanent exhibition.
70,4.0,It's a good place if you want to learn Korean History and I would say that it's one of the biggest museum that I visited in Korea. I think going to this museum is enough for you who wants only a brief history of Korea. It's an indoor activities and english services are provided.
71,5.0,Very interesting place to visit. Very educational and hands-on experience is superb. A great place to spent time with your family especially for your kids.
72,5.0,"Amazing museum. Free entrance. It has three floors with tons of exhibition room. It has a gift shop in every floor, also a food court. Translator, wheelchair rental. Beautiful landscape. Amazing museum"
73,4.0,Wonderful history lesson on Korean culture. Shame that the Joseon exhibition was closed but the other exhibitions made up for it. Audio guide could be improved.
74,5.0,The National Musem of Korea has rooms full of interesting displays.  We enjoyed our visit and learned a lot about Korean History and Culture.  Highly recommend spot.  We lucked out and had a Korean tour guide walk through the museum with us.
75,5.0,"Wonderful collection in an equally wonderful building, with extensive grounds.  Very easily accessed by purpose built tunnel walkways from Ichnon subway station.  There are free English language guided tours twice a day (11.00 & 14.30)  -  definitely worth joining to get an overview of the museum and to view the ""must sees"" before walking around at leisure.  Our very knowledgeable guide spoke excellent English."
76,3.0,"Grand history and magnificent treasures!The park surrounding the huge museum is beautiful and a lot of local kids enjoyed it.It is free to enter and spans three floors, with a fantastic collection of art and ceramics from across Asia and Korean history."
77,4.0,"Very easy to get to, this museum is gigantic. I suggest wearing comfortable shoes and getting a good night's rest before entering.The collection is very impressive, and the souvenir shops have some great offerings. I recommend visiting this place once."
78,4.0,"This is a huge museum. I visited for a full day and only saw maybe half of the collection. Got tired. So, bring good walking shoes. Not a lot of places to eat around here. But maybe I just didn't know where to go. So you will end up eating inside the museum. Which is a bit pricy. Lots of old Korean jewelry in the collection when I was there."
79,4.0,"This museum is really big, if you want to get a closer look to everything you will need a few hours. Entrance is free, which is really great, that's whay you can't go wrong with going here. If you don't like it, just leave :)Although you can see a lot of things it can get a bit boring after seeing the 1000. Buddha statue."
80,3.0,"Visited the national museum this august. As an Asian Studies student, it was quite intersting seeing how they kept referring to china in the museum, and it basically looked as though Korea is nothing more than a side effect of the chinese rise. The museum offers a free tour a couple of times a day. The guide didn't actually know english and basically just stated what's written about the artifacts, but it was still nice. I'd very much reccomend this place for a rainy day. It also has beautiful gardens nearby if you deel like a light stroll."
81,5.0,Best place to buy souvenirs while in Korea. You can find anything in the museum gift shop for anyone of any age. Check out the great calendars.
82,5.0,"The museum is huge, with exhibits spanning across all of Korea's history. We were told that there was limited English, but there were actually a lot of descriptions and signs written in English, it was only some more detailed descriptions on artifacts that was not in English, so don't worry if the audio guide sells out as you will still be able to understand everything. We spent almost a whole day inside, and spent the afternoon/evening wandering around the grounds outside, which I would highly recommend doing if the weather is good. The entry to the museum is free but I would have happily paid!"
83,4.0,"It's great way to learn about their history, but don't do it on a weekend.  There are just so many people running all over the place."
84,3.0,"The building of the national museum of Korea is magnificent and it's free besides the special exhibitions. The reason why I came there is I'm interested in the contemporary history of Korea and I thought there must be some exhibitions about the miracle of Han river, the democratic movement, etc.. But at last I found the content of the museum is only about the ancient history and its items."
85,1.0,"So i decided to pick this one as it is the best, as stated, and to learn something about Korea in its history and culture throughout the years....The structure looks humongous from the outside, and it is large inside too. So much space to move around.I just strolled, and hardly stopped to look at anything, as I found nothing really interesting in general about their display. Most of their artifacts or objects looked way too polished and ""complete"" I wondered if they were just replica and made up stuff. I just don't think things that were from hundreds of years ago could be this ""unharmed"" and ""shinny"". Then, the whole impression of it was, it was a display of porcelain or china by some rich people at their huge mansion. Also, their history is just a minor China alike impression and for me, I felt like nothing was new or worth the learn. The South East Asian hall along with Central Asia and Japan are just as equally pathetic with just few things on display, as if it is collectibles of one's travel souvenirs, I was absolutely dumbfounded! The whole museum is just ""SPACIOUS"", you may now try to define this word here after reading my comments about this point of no interest. Only good thing is, people, be informed, it is FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!The other hall which is an exhibition hall, where we paid W5000 literally for nothing to see bunch of, guess what, MORE china and porcelain from a shipwreck! What a waste of money and time! Bummer!!!!!!!!!!!!!Please! If this is voted the best, I guess I wouldn't have to chance on others then, well, I do not plan to return to Korea in the near future anyway, because just like the museum, it has no culture or manners.Taipei National Palace Museum and Shanghai Museum, they are what museums should be!"
86,5.0,"For a pleasant afternoon of history and art, this is a great venue for foreigners to visit. From the welcoming flowers at the entrance, the scenic gardens, gift shops, and the vast selection of history, there is something for just about everyone. There is an ease in which you can stroll thru the exhibits, read the placards (yes, they are in English too) and take in the vast and rich collections on display. Several stories tall, you might find that you need a break after a bit; they have a small cafe to enjoy refreshments and to sit and catch your breath. I would say that if you read placards and keep an even pace, you can do all three floors in an afternoon. The gardens are great for a stroll and you can meander over to the other museum on the grounds. Check their website for special exhibits and shows!! Oh, and if you're worried about finding the National Museum, it is quick walking distance to the subway.....try right at the entrance. Head to Ichon station and have fun!"
87,5.0,"It is so pleasing to get access to such a great museum for free. Anyone interested in the origins of the nation will learn a great deal.There is a guided tour in English that commences at 2PM and is highly recommended.  Our guide was very passionate and the tour went to 4PM with great explanations of various aspects of Korean culture.We were so pleased and keen to contribute at the end, we decided to patronise the lovely café and enjoy a bit of Korean cuisine."
88,4.0,"A large modern museum with plenty of ancient Korean exhibits over three floors. Plenty of restrooms, cafe and gift shop."
89,5.0,Do consider spending a few hours to appreciate the different sections of this spacious museum. Artefacts are rich in historical value. Consider getting the audio guide to help you understand better. An educational trip which you can make on your own. By subway: Jungang Line Ichon Stn. 150 m towards Yongsan Family Park from Exit 2 orLine 4 Ichon Stn. 150 m towards Yongsan Family Park from Exit 2 (source: english.visitseoul.net)
90,3.0,Liked the visit and some sections were interesting however a little to much pottery and roof tiles.Good activity if weather too wet or too hot. Free as i recall.  The hours of operation can be late 8pm on certain nites of week.Also acces via underground tunnel directly from ichon subway station.
91,3.0,"The National Museum in Ichon is housed in a nice building with a decent view of Namsan, but the displays are fairly boring. If you want to see some of the more beautiful artifacts medieval Korea produced, I'd recommend the Leeum (between Itaewon and Hangangjin stations)."
92,4.0,"This museum is full with korean history, and many cultural things from ancestors is showed there. I remember there are a few buildings : exhibition and museum. We can choose what to see first. But since the area is so large, better to prepare your feet to walk. There's free drinking water inside so don't worry if u get exhausted."
93,5.0,I had a very good time here last year visiting the Polish Exhibition of historical Art from Poland. I have visited this Museum on a number of occasions and enjoy coming back each time for something new. Easily accessible - I took a taxi from Yonsan station and it took about 8 minutes or less. There is a lovely garden in front of it that surrounds a pond. The Museum building has a modern structure and clean lines. I will be back in the near future.
94,4.0,"The National Museum of Korea is huge and full of every Korean artifact imaginable. It's a rainy day location for sure. Your enjoyment of this museum will depend on how well you appreciate Korean art, but if you are bored in one section you can walk (a long distance) to get to another section. Definitely check out the celadon pottery area."
95,5.0,"I spent over a day at this museum. There are several floors and there are dozens of artifacts from each period in Korean history, as well as from each kingdom. The museum has an overwhelming amount of artifacts. The first floor starts from ancient history and works its way toward the present, but for someone who is not already familiar with ancient Korean history, this might be a little difficult to thoroughly enjoy. Each period of history is presented separately, making it difficult to really understand an overall picture of Korean history. Also, it is hard to imagine the artifacts in context. That being said, the amount and scope of artifacts make this a good place to visit if you have lots of time and enjoy seeing ancient pottery, etc. The gardens outside the museum are nice and have a children's park and pagodas.If your time is very limited in Seoul, the National Palace Museum might be a better choice. It deals more with Joseon dynasty royalty but is smaller and easier to appreciate."
96,5.0,"It is an absolute delight to go through the Museum with thousands of exhibits  not just of Korean history but of civilisation as a whole. The Koreans have done a fantastic job in excavating and preserving their history and there are so many museums in Korea that have this on display for the general public. I am grateful to the patronage of so many donors who have researched and donated their priceless artifacts to the museum. It is a huge place, you can spend hours or days going through it. I am grateful to the Korean government for its lavish contribution in creating it, maintaining it and keeping it free......Just kept thinking of the destruction in Palmyra as I was going through this amazing place.."
97,4.0,"From the aircraft, ship displays, gifsbtif monuments outside to the massive and impressive museum inside this is a MUST SEE on your trip to S. Korea. The museum will take you about 4 hours to walk through. It explains all wars Korea has been through starting back in the pre historic time running through to present. Korea has an extensive history which we found very interesting."
98,5.0,Recommend visiting the national museum to exposure yourself to the history and national treasures of Korea. Nice gift shop too.
99,4.0,"Very focused on Korea, China & Japan, with not many artifacts from other parts of the world unlike peer museums in Tokyo or UK for example. However it was still fine for me as I was only looking to learn about Korean history and they did a good job at that."
100,4.0,"The museum is free to enter and has a small recreational area around it to walk. This museum introducts you to the history & culture of the country, however, after visitng major world museums, i wasn't wowed. There were several interesting pieces but it turned out those weren't really Korean and were brought in either by Chinese or on Indian trading ships. They have a very good souvenir shop with some nice ceramics."
101,4.0,I went there with my family. It was so great to see the pieces of Korean history. I did not have much time to see all of this this place but I had great time.
102,5.0,This place is so huge yet very organize! Each floor has this designated room for different era and you will not be confused! The main museum is for free but you have to pay for admission in all the Planned Exhibitions.
103,5.0,"Exhibits are varied and interesting. Information comes in many forms, from the display of artifacts to recreated examples of artifacts that you can touch and hold. Some small theaters show well created movies that give us animated examples of how structures were built, how material culture was crafted, and the history of prominent Korean figures and events. From time to time there are events and they are usually well advertised, and the museum seems to have multiple parts, such as an art exhibit on the west side of the building.Staff are helpful and you will have no trouble with English or Chinese, as well as Korean."
104,5.0,It's not only museum for korea but also have history of most of the asian countries. If you want to study Buddhism then there's a lot of things related to Buddhism.
105,5.0,Korean National Museum is good place for visit for knowledge of Asia.You know much more about Asian history
106,4.0,"Korea really does museums right. There are a staggering number of items on display at any one time, and most have interpretive displays in several languages. Admission is free although they happily accept donations."
107,4.0,"If you're a history buff, go for it! But get a tour guide to explain what do the structures mean and all. Like any palace musuem there is always an interesting story. I would definitely go again but with a tour guide."
108,5.0,"This is a great day trip...it is located right off the Subway exit with great directions. The view of the Namsan tower on the backside was nice. There is a cafe as well. There are lots of exhibits and a lot to see. It was a bit overwhelming, but it was neat to learn about Korean history. If I had more time I would have taken a guided tour."
109,3.0,"The place is so vast and if you're into history you should visit this place!  You will learn not only about Korea but also other countries!  I guess, this is one of the biggest museum in the world."
110,2.0,"Visited with bad weather so cannot really say anything about the outside and park around it just that the building itself is very impressive and that alone is worth a view, next the entrance is free. The content on the first floor is worthwhile but going more to the top it really got more of the same and wasn't worth our time. If pressed for time visit the war museum instead this left much more of an impression on us."
111,4.0,Interesting for one who is learning about some of Koreas history. Was a little confused at some parts as it felt that other asian countries such as Japan made more of an appearance that Korean history. There was drinking water everywhere which was nice when taking a short break from viewing beautiful items.
112,5.0,This is one of the biggest museum of Korea. It is needed at least 4 hours at minimal to have a good view of all exibitions. You can find very important aspects of Korean History.
113,4.0,There are free tours for this so I highly recommend to get  a feel and view of this place. Its really peaceful in the grounds and museum and you feel like you could take your time - there are various attractions ie picnic area etc that you could visit. The childrens museum is next to this but restricted to 300 visitors so would suit  young ones.Also if you get to the top of teh stairs (check pics) you get a really good photo shot of seoul (exercise and photo opportunity). This place is spacious - when we visited there were cultural dancing in front of the main steps outside. There are toilets on every floor (always a plus) and also a library. The cafe is expensive but there are books inside that you can read whilst sipping tea. There is a library and a lake which is peaceful - also a picnic area where there were some massive marrow /cucumber hanging from the branches. YOu coudl bring your own food here and it was good to see children making teh most of this. It suits family and young ones as there is a lot of spaces/activities to explore.
114,3.0,"The museum itself is gorgeous and well maintained. Beautiful building and impressive technology and overall look. We weren't as impressed with the content inside however. Although there is a wide variety, there wasn't so much historical context provided and we felt we didn't really learn enough. The main floor was far better than the 2nd or 3rd. There was also quite a bit of information in Korean, but there seemed to be lacking some in English.An ok trip, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're pressed for time. I enjoyed the war memorial much more."
115,5.0,The museum is so large and the exhibits so informative we couldn't see everything in four hours.  We will definitely come back to the museum.
116,5.0,I found this to be very interesting.  It is a very large museum and it's beautiful.  Learned things I didn't know about the Korean culture.  If you enjoy history this is a must.
117,5.0,"its a magnificent museum. i spend half day there, but still not enough. it have 4 floor. just enter the 1st floor and i lost in time.its worth to spend the whole day there. i want to go back there again.need to wear a comfort shoes there, its sooooo huge.bring also a good camera, but dont turn on the flash. dont bring water there, they have in each floor the free drinking water.they even have a restaurants at the 1st floor, from korean-japanese-chinese to western food to choose.i just need to enjoy the history of south Korea."
118,4.0,"i'm sure if i had visited this museum first, i would had enjoyed but seeing as i had visited the Gyeonbukgung museum, i had already an heard a lot about the main exhibit.   there's a really awesome small scale 3D map of Seoul and you get to walk over it, it's just fantastic.  there's various small scale models of old korean neighborhoods, it's just fatastic"
119,4.0,"Beautiful building and well laid out. Progresses chronologically through the history of Korea. The descriptions are a bit repetitive, and would have been nice to have more details . More artefacts, art, sculpture, and diversity would have been nice, but I had feeling much of what should be in this museum is in China and Japan. Many school classes visit this place, so rooms can get crowded, but not for long. There is small cafeteria tucked half way between the 1st and 2nd floor, good view and worth visit."
120,5.0,"This is a beautiful, excellent museum.  Collections are beautifully displayed, the architecture is spectacular.  Plan to spend a least half a day, there is so much to see.  The restaurant is also excellent with a surprising range of offerings, even really good for kids.  Check out the other organizations right there, too, and walk the grounds.  Wonderful store with a tremendous range of merchandise, offered at a range of prices."
121,4.0,"This is a small museum but very interesting, it's free to enter which is nice and very spacious & well laid out, the displays are a little minimal but enough to keep you interested. My husband and I both enjoyed the overlook of the city exhibit, quite amazing how they have done this. On the subway its line 5 (purple) to Seodaemun exit 4"
122,5.0,we went this museum no planwas so good Was so big than expectedi feel like i need to know my cultureAnd this is so helpful to me to know my culture  was too big so maybe i need to visit here again later
123,4.0,"Free entry and easy access via subway.  Really beautiful building and gardens, extensive displays.  Korea has worked hard at uncovering and displaying is very rich history and culture.  The audio guides are helpful.  The museum is very large, take your time.  On Wednesdays it's open till 10pm"
124,5.0,"When I first arrived at the museum by foot, it was huge in my opinion. There is free admission to view the exhibit, but there is also exhibits that you can pay to see. There is lots of space outside as well. Really clean building. Depending on the day that you go, it can be busy or empty."
125,4.0,"So you know nothing of the history of Korea? Well don't feel left out, few do outside the peninsula. Although it's not as exciting as Japanese Shoguns and Samurai, or Chinese walls to keep out Mongolian invaders, Korean history has its sparkle as well. The museum is vast and well-kept. It's practically free considering the prices of museums in Europe and America. There are gardens at the back of the building that are beautiful and quite peaceful."
126,5.0,"Free national museum in Seoul. Very nice with lots of Korean history stuff. Celadon in 3rd floor and first floor, 3 kingdoms hall are great. After looking around the museum, went to the foodcourt which is next to the museum shop. I did not have a expectaion for this food court but it is better than I expected. I quite liked simple plate, Port curtlet. The Museum shop has also many miniature products. Very beautiful."
127,2.0,"For me it's a little boring compared to the war memorial. There are a lot of artifacts and things displaying there, but the description are all in Korean, perhaps with a line stating what it is in English. So, i failed to understand and chose to leave early."
128,5.0,"The National Museum is a vast place.  As with other very large museums, like say the Met in New York, it's easy to exhaust yourself.  I highly recommend choosing a few areas of interest, whether it's ceramics, calligraphy, Buddhist art, furniture, or whatever, and just visiting those targeted areas.  The gift shop is nice and has some high-guality items on offer.  I can say from experience that the restaurant at the far end serves very nice desserts.  In addition, the grounds are lovely and worth exploring if the weather is not too hot or too cold."
129,4.0,If you need anything to get interesting overview of Korean history check out the museum it's free admission and it's a very nice display of intricate Korean artifacts and history check it out I loved it
130,4.0,"The National Museum of Korea is the largest museum in the country and definitely worth seeing, even if there's a lot of similar stuff I had already seen at other museums, including the National Palace Museum at Gyeongbokkung as well as the National Museum in Gyeonju; this one is the biggest and has the most comprehensive sweep of Korean history and culture. It's large, but you can probably do the museum in around two hours, not including special exhibitions. And you can get there by subway, even if it's a bit of a walk (around 15-20 minutes) from the nearest station. I do think the exterior of the building could be so much more interesting; it just looks like a big shoebox. And the galleries named for major donors are a bit off-putting in terms of flattering their vanity. But this museum is definitely worth a visit if you can get there. Note: it's wheelchair-accessible once you get inside the museum, but you have to climb a long incline to get up to the entrance. In any case, make sure to see the giant pagoda in the middle of the museum~!"
131,2.0,The I'm sure otherwise excellent staff placed me in a wonderful fully guided tour... in Chinese... no English was available at the time. Sooooo boring when you don't understand...I just left.
132,4.0,"Go to Ichon subway station. Follow the direction to National Museum of Korea. Go to the building on your right which is the correct museum; the left museum was for art exhibition and it is not free; the National Museum is FREE!! If you need to pay some fee means you are in the wrong side. Free wi-fi available. The place is neat, tidy and well maintained; the display was very well adjusted with descriptions, yap they provide English as well. It is quite interesting but I think this place suits historian better."
133,3.0,"If you're interested in knowing the history and legacy of Korea its a good place for you. You will find chinese, japanese and korea statues and artfacts. 3 hours would be more than enough to explore the place."
134,5.0,"A world class Museum where you can easily spend an entire day. Many of the exhibits have descriptions in English and also a marker indicating if they are a national Treasure.The building itself is impressive and the grounds are quite beautiful, especially in the Spring.Well worth a visit."
135,5.0,"There is so much to see that you could easily spend the full day.  You can learn all about the history of Korea, and the museum is very well maintained.  I found it to be very clean and well organized."
136,5.0,"I learnt so much of Korea's history from this museum.  Everything is extremely easy to follow, the exhibits were amazing. It is also such a beautiful building.  We had been there 2 hours and if had absolutely flown by.  You should allow at least 1/2 day for a visit."
137,5.0,It was a good chance for me to find out more about Korean culture.I love Korea and this trip more cool than I expected.
138,5.0,"If you love history like I do, you will love this place, you will be able to see the development of the Korean culture. from the cave tims to the futuristic present they are now."
139,4.0,"Most travelers will only visit one museum, one place, one~~~ well, if you really only have time to go to one, I would go to this one! It is huge! There is a lot to see, and the English guide was very helpful. The temporary exhibit is always changing, so I try to go every few months. It is a great place to explore and learn about Korean history."
140,5.0,"Very easy to go, just get off at Ichon station and follow the sign. There're so many things to see, I wish I have more time."
141,3.0,"Lots of beautiful artefacts, but they're not really presented in an engaging way. If you have been to museums elsewhere in Korea you'll probably see much of the same things."
142,5.0,"During the past decade, the S Korean government has really knocked itself out to upgrade its national museums and to offer most of the exhibits to the public for free.  One of the best examples is the National Museum.  The museum is spacious, appropriately lit depending on the exhibit, often using multimedia, with detailed explanations in English as well as Korean.  Furthermore, some of the museum guides are multilingual and graduated from the elite of Korea's universities.  As such, they are often more than competent to answer visitors' questions.The museum also often hosts foreign exhibitions.  Those exhibitions only require admittance fees.  So one can easily spend a half day for free, exploring an exceptional museum"
143,5.0,South Korea has very strong culture. Its the best place learn about it with south korea History. Huge Museum and very well Maintained.
144,5.0,"It's a lovely building with a lot of natural light. It has so much more to see here than the 2 palaces we've visited and it's free admission. There are a few cafes or you can bring a packed lunch. There are facilities such as use of lockers, stroller hire, hot & cold drinking water and very clean toilets."
145,5.0,"This is an excellent museum near ichon station. The station connect underground to the museum. There are some really wonderful displays of Korean Prehistoric and historic artifacts as well as neighboring countries. Also, don't miss the Buddhist sculptures, they're quite amazing. The facilitates are very clean and modern. You can easily spend most of a day here. Also a small convenience shop out side the main building for snacks.As with many sightseeing spots in Korea, it is closed on Monday. It's free to enter but there may be a small fee for special exhibits.As soon as you walk in there will be a reception are for tourists maps and pamphlets in English.Also they have storage lockers you can use for a small fee."
146,4.0,"Definitely worth a visit when you are in Seoul. Huge museum, learned a lot, and best of all it is free to enter!"
147,4.0,A lot of artifacts and history of Korea to look at! I loved the Buddhist statues and paintings the most! There was just so much information to absorb. I recommend if you really want to absorb it all take two days to visit to be able to really look and read all the information that is given to you
148,4.0,"This place is HUGE! really really huge and very well designed too. there were a lot of school trips around and was kinda crowded but yet not stuffy, we enjoyed ourselves but had to skip a lot due to lack of time. If you are interested in korea's history you definitely need to go there and spend at least a full day there!"
149,5.0,Very good museum full of all treasure from around Korea and Asia. I really like the space and how they create the route to understand Korean History. There are lots of interesting and inspiring objects to see.
150,5.0,Three stories of Korean and Asian art in a clean modern facility.  Ample lounges on all floors with quiet views of the city for the foot weary.  Food court and gift shops with beautiful Korean art & crafts
151,5.0,We spent several hours here. The art and history are beautifully displayed. Very esthetically pleasing. Lots to learn about the history of Korea.  Gift shop mediocre but the museum itself is spectacular.   Very worthwhile visiting.
152,4.0,"I visited with a group February 18.  To start, the museum buildings are beautiful.  They are large, well lighted and open.  The objects are beautifully displayed in large galleries.  I was impressed with how each gallery flowed into another.  There are 3 floor with stairs and escalators between each.  If you like museums, plan at least 2 hours.  There were small Gift Shops on each floor but save time for the ground floor Gift Shop which had really nice things for sale!"
153,5.0,"You can see korian history there. Traditional house ,palace and lots more. Arts andcraft works , there traditional life and historical back ground ."
154,5.0,Don't miss ! It's a very huge museum in Seoul. Many rooms and exhibition. Should arrive in the morning and spend at least 3 hours here. Food court is located outside the museum (in the front) as well as the convenience store.
155,4.0,"I've been to this museum a few times.  It is very well laid out, and has a lot of different things.  It tends to emphasixe the artistic aspects of Korean history.  There are various English-language helps:  electronic and labels.Outside, you can relax and contemplate, which, for me, is great, considering how hectic Seoul is.It might be a little confusing going in, knowing whither to go and what to do with packages and cloaks, but just ask."
156,5.0,"Worth seeing to understand Korean history and art, there is also free english-speaking guide who will definitely lift up your mood"
157,5.0,"The museum consists of three floors and covers Korean history rather extensively. There's also a children's section and special exhibitions. The museum is easy to get to and in a beautiful location. If you're in Seoul during the Pompeii exhibition, it's definitely worth the excursion."
158,4.0,"If you are a museum go-ers, you should not miss this museum. I came in Nov 2012 where there was some construction going on and it took me a while to find this museum and now you get to see the museum once you come out of the exit. No need to search around, absolute convenience! The museum itself is beautiful and you can see the N Seoul Tower behind the museum. The standard exhibition is free admission and it holds details of history of the country.The collection is huge and if you spend time looking thru all items it easily takes a day. This visit I do not have the time to view all the standard exhibition just like my previous visit. Hence I'll be back!  =)"
159,3.0,as usual most artifacts are probably taken to Japan during the occupation years. Probably more Korean artefacts in North Korea and in North east china.
160,4.0,A well laid out museum with very interesting exhibits clearly labeled with all the information you need to understand the exhibits. Lots of water fountains and bathrooms that are easy to find.
161,4.0,This is one of the largest museums in Korea and I can see why. The exhibits are definitely impressive and quite informative too. The whole setting and the layout of the museum is well thought and the surroundings and the building itself is an artwork in itself. You cannot finish the entire trip in a day as there is so much to see and the collections are massive.
162,4.0,"A nice place to look a korean's history and I must say they had done this quite well.  Very nicely presented.  Though I am not a museum lover, I appreciated my visit here."
163,5.0,"Love the layout of this massive structure and its surroundings! + The permanent installation gives you a good lesson in Korean history, culture and art. + Cheap (free if I remember correctly)+ Not to many people (weekday)+ Not far from the subway- They have another building for temporary exhibitions, to enter was much more expensive! ㅠㅠ"
164,4.0,"Overall I really liked this museum, and coming in the morning it was quieter and easier to get around than later in the day. We had an english language tour that covered about 1/3 of the galleries and then we went back to see the other things. Unfortunately the museum focuses a lot on pottery and buddhist artifacts and not so much about Korea itself. It just seemed there was a bit of the story of the country missing, although to a great extent perhaps the point would be to go to the War Museum and the Palace museum to have a bigger picture."
165,5.0,"National Museum of Korea has lots of national treasures and collections from the Bronze age to Japanese colonial era.    There are English, Japanese, Chinese exihibition interpretations and also there is an exihibition interpretation with sign language for the hearing-impaired. Besides it is child-friendly because there is children's museum.  In museum shop you can buy souveniors which are associated with collections.  Sum-up : National Museum of Korea(국립중앙박물관) is the nice place to look at Korean history and national treasures with your family, friends and so on.* Opening hours : Tue, Thu, Fri. 9am~6pm, Wed. Sat. : 9am~9pm, Sun.public holiday : 9am~7pm(except Jan. 1)* Admission fee : Free(except sepcial exihibition) * Location : Subway No.4 exit no.2 5min on foot."
166,5.0,"It is big building with lots of things from different Asian countries! You can go there more and more. If you like culture, you will enjoy this place!!!"
167,4.0,"Maybe in asia can be one of best modern architecture Mussuem , well made it and clean , great lighting + free entrance . Only negative thing ,   there isn't so many valuable items there ."
168,4.0,Very direct and well informed describes this museum.  If you want to learn about Korean history this is the place to be.  Great info and many exhibits brings you back in time.  A great place to spend several hours learning about Korea.
169,5.0,loved the museum and have had a good understanding of the traditions and humble nature of the past and the present.
170,5.0,"If this is the only museum you see on your visit to Seoul, you will have seen one of the outstanding Museums of this size in the world. I love Museums. I see them everywhere I go and I am tolerant of flaws for the sake of conservation. This is a lovely place. A wonderful collection of national treasures, beautifully displayed and comfortable to tour. A good restaurant and shop.The visiting shows are housed in an adjacent building the is also a wonderful display area. The museum is free. There are gardens and outdoor space. Really a wonderful location. Enjoy."
171,5.0,"This is the best museum i have visited in Asia.  It is education and you will learn how the different countries in Asia have influenced the beautiful country of S. Korea.  It is where you can find the precious cultural assets of Korea's historical background til the modern times.  Spend about half a day here, it will be worthy of your time."
172,5.0,An extraordinary rich culture brought to life through art and history. Enjoyed learning and especially the pottery.
173,4.0,"It was raining hard, so instead of trying to go out shopping in Insadong, I ended up going to the museum to entertain myself without getting wet. Museum entrance is free and I spent a whole day browsing around and admiring how beautiful Korean history and it's arts was. I even had morning buns and latte at the cafeteria, and it was good. I ended up buying a bunch of souvenirs at the store. What a productive and educational day indeed!"
174,4.0,"Quiet, clean, plenty to see. We were with a group, so we didn't get to explore on our own. If I had the time to go back, I would."
175,3.0,There were not as many artifacts as I had hope for. Most of the items on displayed were rather recent; from 19th century onwards.
176,3.0,"nice city map, big museum and nice garden. you can spend there easily 3 hours. outdoor and indoor. nice and friendly staffs"
177,5.0,Good location. Very accessible.  Place is well maintained.  Toilets needs more maintenance. Staffs are ready to help out. Enough sitting areas to accommodate visitors who are overwhelmed by the place.
178,4.0,"I guess it depends on your interests but I found the set up very good but you can only see that much of pots until it gets boring. Still, well worth a visit but stay away from the food & coffee."
179,4.0,"The museum is really nice, big, easy to explore inside and very much interesting. The first floor is all about the Korean history and was exciting and was the one i loved about the museum. The other floors (2-3 more or something) was more about art and cultural pieces, which was great and from all over asia, so if you are in to that you will be happy there to. But really great museum, best National museum I've been to!"
180,4.0,"If you are interested in history, you should go and spend a view hours inside. Read the signs, otherwise plates, swords and coins are not special! If you don't like history see the museum from the outside (amazing and huge building!) and visit the Family Park next to it. Check out the homepage for free English tours through the museum! We also really enjoyed the Teahouse inside! You can taste many different traditional teas!"
181,5.0,This museum is definitely worth visiting. The architecture is amazing and very spacious. The displays are of high quality and as usual in modern Korean museums well supported by audio visual gadgets. The access is very impressive and you can get there from Ichon Metro Station through an underground walkway protecting you from becoming wet in wet summers.
182,4.0,Well worth visiting. This place is very educational and well worth the effort of getting there. You could easily bring your family or friends to this place.
183,5.0,It is a place where you have to be while visiting Korea. Museum has a great structure/design. It is free to entry and give us a great lesson of Korean history and broad overlook at its culture
184,4.0,"This museum is free!  There are special exhibits that require a fee.  I would recommend getting a tour guide to get a broader understanding of the art.  We used the headsets which did not help with navigating the museum efficiently or add a great deal more than the descriptions on the art.  I ran into a guide giving an English speaking group a tour.  She was entertaining, interesting, and brought a wonderful perspective to each piece."
185,5.0,"You might not think so, judging by the name, but I feel as though this is one of Seoul's best kept secrets.  So many of my expat friends have never been, and it's an outright shame.  The entry is free, and the grounds themselves are beautiful.  There is so much to learn and see.  Some of the artifacts are likely to be among the oldest you've ever seen, especially if you're from a young nation such as the USA or Australia.  Bring a camera, and make sure it doesn't run out of battery (as mine did...) As for location, just head to Ichon station and you can't miss it!"
186,5.0,"Very impressive museum ....I can only praise it...I learnt a. Lot but don't try and do it all in a few hours or you'll lose patience. Concentrate on a few rooms , hire a headset and have lunch there."
187,5.0,You would find scores of stuff and have a look at ancient Korea and why is it called hermit kingdom.Ii worth one visit for Indians to feel proud of their rich heritage.
188,4.0,"There is so much information to ingest here that you really need to spread it out over a few days. If all you want to do is walk through and look at stuff you could tackle that in a few hours, but you really want to appreciate the history that is here. The museum is huge and you need to allot several hours to get through maybe even three sections. I had to come here several times and after 1yr in Korea did not manage to complete every section. There are brochures in English and several other languages. There are two sides to the museum and the right side is free. The other side houses a concert hall and special exhibitions."
189,4.0,Well only go if you are interested in the history.. But its rather educational and interesting to learn about Korea history .
190,5.0,"Korea is a peculiar country. Situated at the North-Eastern edge of the Eurasian continent its history has been overshadowed by China, whose influence is omnipresent throughout the country's historic narrative and obvious for most to see. Today Korea feels still somewhat overshadowed by its larger and more prominent neighbours, China and Japan, and makes the news mostly because of its technology Chaebols and the nuclear and military North Korean antics, Korea has a beautiful and long-standing history to show and this is the place to come to if you want to learn more about the cultural development and achievements of the Korean people.The museum is easily reached via Ichon Station on Seoul Subway Line 4 and Jungang Line and is directly connected via an underpass from the station itself. The museum grounds are beautiful to behold themselves, boosting a large pond some pretty gardens but it is the Museum building itself that is the real eye catcher, a mammoth of a structure housing a almost inexhaustible array of artefacts from the peninsular and wider Asia. The museum is chronologically laid out and  goes into a lot of detail explaining aspects of Korean culture and historic milestones in the nation's timeline, giving visitors a real deep dive into the psyche and legacy of a people that deserve more attention on the world stage. The free entry to this magnificent place is only the icing on top of a sumptuous culture cake that is not to be missed by any visitor to Seoul."
191,5.0,Its a free museum in addition to being an awesome visit. Not too many interactive exhibits but there is a nice outdoor family park. Can be a great relaxing day to walk the park and then into the building during the hot part of the day. Restaurant at the lake is pricey but the convenience store has all the necessities. Easy walk from the subway. Great views of Seoul Tower!!!
192,5.0,beautiful building and free entry charge to the permanent exhibition . the special exhibit this time around was the Charles Monet's collection of impressionism and it was amazing cause it was so close and some of them had no glass so you can see the brush strokes and smell the pain
193,5.0,"Yes i sound like a spam title. But seriously, they should start charging people. Great collection of national treasures and historic artifacts and paintings. Spacious and quiet if you are lucky enough to avoid field tripping schoolkids. Wonderful garden. Location is kind of tricky. Use subway if possible."
194,5.0,"This place is awesome!!! simply recommenadable for foreigners visiting the country,because it has a free entry in main hall and whole lot of beaituful sceneries especially in spring like in May or June of the year..lot of good sceneries and that it has good connetivity using subway,and  city tour bus one thing it lacks is that it is still expanding in its contents and attracts whole lot of people,due to which your valuable experience might go unpleasant"
195,5.0,"It's a very big museum filled with the history of Korea but also other sections. It is a good way to start a trip if you're interested in Korean culture and history, it helps to understand better many things and will help you to get a historical starting context at other important cultural locations in the country during your trip. I thought it was really interesting and definitely worth spending a day :)"
196,4.0,"Pretty standard museum. The best part was a video animation of a traditional Chinese painting that changes with the seasons. It was so good we watched it twice! Unless you are very... historical... you probably won't get much out of it. We didn't visit the children's museum at the same location, but I imagine it is more entertaining for families."
197,5.0,Admission free.  Setting in gardens very attractive. Layout and displays excellent with English explanations for majority.  Lounges or seating areas well placed for when you needed a break.
198,4.0,"Very spacious museum with many artifacts.  However, not all the explanations were in available in English, some videos were only in Korean."
199,5.0,"This museum was amazing to me, lots to see, lots to learn. I was mesmerized by the level of culture that they have to offer. Is extremely clean, easy to navigate. For those of us who do not speak Korean, they have guides in several languages. Go visit, is free and you will have a good time. I highly recomend this museum."
200,3.0,A bit basic and the English captions were often missing or confusing. The building is very beautiful though.
201,4.0,The main thing is when you travel to this end of the world you must forget about being British and relax and step into there world it turns everything magical! The building is beautiful lots of story's to be told but I found it hard to understand but this was only due to me being English and not having there way of thinking but I love this country love it. If you like history and have a deep understanding of it this is the place to visit!
202,3.0,"i love its design, it's a clean big and free admission museum. never had kinda stuff in my country.. not for museum.. but, it's kinda boring if you take more than 3 hours.."
203,3.0,"The exhibits themselves are a bit thin on the ground, so you don't get a very full picture of what Korean history was really like. Unfortunately the Korean peninsula has often been invaded and many artifacts were stolen or destroyed by the occupiers. I'd still recommend the place, though, because is is a very nice environment to be in."
204,5.0,"i like it, you can see all history of korea in hall with beautiful building and easy to go there by subway to Ichon station, from subway you can exit to meet to National museum of korea"
205,4.0,"This is a serious museum for history-loving types, but even for everyone else the building's architecture alone with its soaring ceiling, and the handful of massive artifacts will surely leave some lasting memories. First bit of advice: DON'T try to see everything in one visit. Simply too big; you'll get tired. Second, if you're here for more than two hours, make use of the cafe for a much-needed break. As for the exhibits, be sure and see the large Buddha statues, if anything; they are a not-to-miss exhibit. From there, it all depends on you - paintings, old maps, ancient hardware, pottery... you name it, you got it. If you've made it all the way to Korea, I'd stick with the Korean exhibits, especially the real ancient stuff (Koryeo dynasty, etc.) and take a good look at the ""National Treasures"" as they are the big shots in this place. Otherwise, as they say, take in what you like, and be prepared to ""skim"" past some displays cases if you come on a busy weekend (hint: winter weekends are popular, as are children's school holidays). On your way out, be sure and stock up on some memorabilia at the nicely stocked gift shop."
206,5.0,A wonderful modern museum with the relics and treasures that were saved from various distructions. the perfect display to get to know Korean history
207,5.0,"I'm amazed with everything inside this museum.. Clean, well organized and nice setting. Most displays in Korean, but thanks to the front desk guy who provide me small device for translating Korean displays."
208,4.0,It was a very nice museum.  But it would have been even nicer if there were more English explanations for those of us who don't read Korean.
209,4.0,"don't miss this museum when you go on city tour using city tour bus, one of ""the must see"" building, one of the biggest museum i enter so far...."
210,3.0,"This museum is kinda big.. 3floor and very comfortable.. the architecture for this building is also very nice.. connected with subway , you'll first see what they called 'moving museum' along the way to the museum..For english speaking guide tour, they provide at 10.30 am and 2.30 pm (tuesday to sunday).. and if you need to rechrge your phone, they provide free facilities .although i really recommends you to take the tour since english explanation is a bit not explaining at all :)On weekend, you'll gonna stumbled with lots of korean junior high visitting this museum with their teacher (and even do their assignment there!)on several part, they have touchscreen which offer games related with history (in korean)"
211,4.0,"The museum is easy to get to as the subway exit leads directly to the museum. Was quite overwhelmed (in a good way) with the grandeur and beauty of the building. It is rather spacious in a simple way, without a whole lot of distractions. There are three floors with two sides on each floor so it is easy to navigate through. The exhibits are displayed in a chronological format. I agree with one of the reviewers below that the museum took on a conservative approach in it's approach. The explanations are quite basic and lack some imagination to captivate and engage museum-goers beyond the artifacts presence. I would have been more interested in seeing more cultural history, such as education, occupations, food, and rituals. The cafeteria is quite modern and attractive. Did not eat here, so cannot comment on the food itself. Took a peep into the gift shop, which ended up being a short walkthrough as many of the items we saw were quite expensive, and we were not interested in the less-expensive items. Still a worthwhile visit, as it is free, and provides a good overview of the history of cultural Korea."
212,5.0,There was an excellent english guided tour conducted by volunteer tour guides at 230pm. It went on for a full 2 hours and covered some history and different era of Korea as well as overview of the key exhibits in the museum. Definitely recommended.
213,3.0,They have a lot of stuff on exhibit since Korea has a long history.  The place is big but i thought the exhibits could have been presented in a more creative manner.  I think it was too boxy and too conventional.  It doesn't do enough justice to korean history and culture
214,5.0,"In a week packed with so many other things to see and do, the opportunity to visit the museum arose only on our last afternoon, and our timetable afforded us little more than an hour there, which was scarcely time to skate through more than a couple of floors of wonderful exhibits, with the 5th century Silla Crown and Girdle being outstanding even among so many other superb exhibits.  The building and the collection it houses deserves more time on any itinerary, and shows off the artifacts that help visitors appreciate the wealth of Korea's cultural history."
215,4.0,We were waiting to go on a DMZ tour from USO which is not far from this museum so we really were only filling in time. Sadly we would have liked to have spent much more time here but what we saw we liked - a very well designed Memorial Hall. Battle rooms were full of information and lots of reading to do.
216,5.0,"I was guided with a very well English speaker! He explained everything clearly and really, it was very...very interesting. Especially if you enjoy watching Korean historical drama.This museum's design is also very good. The collections also are amazing. Especially the Buddhist sculptures. Totally worth it spending almost whole day here.Oh! Visit the museum market too! They sell historical-but-cute things. Not really expensive too. You can get stuff there as souvenir."
217,5.0,"I spent an entire day walking through this museum. If you like art, history, or free stuff, this place is for you."
218,3.0,"The building itself is impressive in size and design, but the artefacts are unimpressive. The audio-visuals in the museum are well done. We went during the recent 'Thanksgiving' National holiday, so entry to all exhibits was free. We had a quick look around, but unless you are a real history buff you have not missed too much."
219,3.0,There were many different halls for different eras and on different arts. E.g. Calligraphy was also one of the main themes. Personally I liked the area showcasing the Sila era due to my interest after watching a Korean drama on it. A very big area of exhibits..definitely require a lot of energy and interest to finish walking through every one of the halls.
220,3.0,"Although extensive in its artifacts, this museum can be a bit dry.  Go for moments at a time and savor a room or level.  The tea shop upstairs has a lovely garden and view"
221,5.0,"Everything is awesome, no more words to describe it, it's a must see when you get to Seoul, watch for the dates, you might get lucky and find a very interesting exhibition here!"
222,3.0,"I went there and I only had time to see the top 3 floors. When we arrived late in the day, all of the MP3 and PDA translators were checked out. There was a small fee of 1,000 KRW to rent them. If you do not have them, you will not know what the exhibits are about. There is a title in English and some pieces have an English translation must most do not. I felt from what I saw that it was pretty boring. I did not see the prehistoric stuff though. There was a special exhibit of Turkish kings but did not have time to see it. The plaza is a great photo op to have your picture taken with the Namsan Tower behind you. Go for that alone. The grounds are extensive and there is a nice pagoda in the middle of the pond in front.There is a GS25 on the property as well as turkish kebabs and ice cream......coffee, drinks etc. The GS was pricey for some items. The gift shop was ok."
223,5.0,Free entertainment for the day and also get culturally educated at the same time. The National Museum of Korea was a quite place to relax and stay warm during the winter months. The layout of the Museum was logical and show cased each item clearly.
224,5.0,"But heed others advice.. A couple of hits and you will be ""antiquities-d"" out. Particularly enjoyed the treasures from the shipwreck on level three. 30,000 artifacts discovered in the 1970's off the southwest coast of Korea from a trading ship going between China and Japan. Also, the museum has apparently never heard of ""museum pricing"" wonderful gifts at regular prices.The Children's Museum was attached and while we didn't head in, the family-watching at the food court between the museums was pretty interesting as well."
225,4.0,I have been here 8 years ago and I find it still very interesting. They are all kept in good condition. Well managed. Very informative.
226,4.0,"The architecture is as fascinating as the exhibits and the museum is laid out very well, allowing you to move through time periods sequentially. The permanent displays are free and there are food facilities inside and outside. One down point - there doesn't seem to be the same peaceful museum etiquette in Korea as there is in the West. So expect loud adults and children alike, the sound echoing around the halls with the curators doing nothing about it."
227,4.0,"If you want to learn about Korean History, this is a great place to start. Won't post spoilers; just a tip -- the iPhone and Android NMK app only covers the ground floor exhibits. It's a bit cheesy but very functional and free."
228,4.0,"It definitely is the National Museum of Korea with relevant displays and exhibits, but it is rather lackluster unless you are really fascinated with Korean Culture. It is quite big and spacious and the outside of the museum is almost like a park where you can just enjoy a stroll along the pond during the late afternoon.I recommend taking advantage of the free museum guides who volunteer at certain times of the day rather than spending your money on those audio guides. (unless you really want to)"
229,5.0,The collection is very easy to visit.  The reasons for including artifacts is carefully explained in terms of building the Korean culture.
230,4.0,This place is huge and takes a long time to go through if you really want to see everything.  An afternoon is not enough to see it all.  It's a very interesting place and well worth the visit.
231,3.0,"Agree with most members,  only rate them average.  Nothing interesting  i completed most of the halls  in 1 hours.   My sister who is with me, fell sleeping  only after visited  1 hall.- 1st  Floor - Prehistory and Ancient History of Korea ,2nd Floor - Calligraphy and Painting  3rd Floor - Mostly sculpture and crafts  of Buddhist"
232,3.0,"We've decided to come here on our last day before departure just to kill time and some traveler we met on the road strongly suggested the museum. However, we found it quite boring and the artifacts display were less attractive to us. I even felt sleep while looking at the display artifacts. We expect there will be more miniature of palaces that sort of things to be displayed. But, at the end, good things is, I understand Korean history."
233,2.0,Nothing special. No aircon. We traveled all the way there and lasted about 15 minutes.
234,4.0,Admission if free and the scenery around the museum is beautiful
