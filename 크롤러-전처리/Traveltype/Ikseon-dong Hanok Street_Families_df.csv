You can use NaverMap to guide you there as google map doesn’t work well in South Korea. Loads of instagram worthy spots and cafes. There is a nice little hotteok stall near Seine Dessert. Seine Dessert is another cute little cafe with pretty desserts and nice and different European themed interior on each floor. Apart from Hotteok, we tried the pancake at Flipper’s. How was the pancake? Good, but i still prefer Pauline Pancake. Apart from Cafes, there are also bakeries and shops that sells hats, accessories and flowers. You can spend some good 2 hours in this area."

All places are good for pictures and as you imagined many people who take pictures. There is custom rental shops which you can try on early 1900's.We tried grape fruit Bingsu (shaving milk ice) that cool down us."

Love the vibe of the place as it is filled with well designed cafes, restaurants and boutiques created by good use / reuse of traditional architectural elements of the old hanoks mix with contemporary ideas."

Almost all restaurants/cafe had a queue. How I miss the atmosphere it was, 2 years back.Each shop/cafe/restaurant seems interesting to explore. A cafe filled with flowers was so pretty but the crowd kills the mood of having the leisure afternoon tea session.Tried a topokki restaurant that serves in a flower shape bowl. No idea on this cafe name but it was super yummy and addictive that we went back for another round. And we queued like 30 mins for the 1st round. Well worth the wait! It's not in the main stretch, got to watch around the corners and the doors are painted in green."

They are good to visit, though.Some houses may be old. And most seems quite new."
