0,1.0,"Female dealers were Extremely unprofessional. Rude, not focused on their job but rather gossiping about other female customers. That’s really unprofessional behavior I have ever seen from casinos worldwide!They also mumble and cuss at foreign female customers just because they think that they can’t understand.I heard it all and was very turned off by this behavior.Focus on your job!The male dealers however, seemed ok except for one guy Choi Jinsung, who had a bad attitude problem too. He never once smiled and opens your cards even without your instruction. I could have made a complaint to the manager but was not bothered.Buck up guys, foreigners are your clientele. And if you don’t enjoy your job, don’t make it a problem for customers."

3,4.0,"Small casino compare to Macau, but good selection of gambling tables. Slots are relatively less, however the table bets are good enough for us to pass some night time. Free drinks and foods, which is very good compare to casinos in other countries. Give it a try if you are boring at night..-)"
4,2.0,It is OK.  It isn't what you expect.  There is very little English spoken if though no Koreans are allowed inside.  The over all experience is pretty dull at Walker.
