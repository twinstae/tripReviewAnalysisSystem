The Osulloc tea room sells very good Korean tea and herbal infusions, but the prices are outrageous."

Most of the stores open by 10am - there is a mix of stores selling traditional pottery, artworks as well as souvenir shops and more expensive boutiques and antique stores.  Restaurants, tea rooms and snack shops are plentiful.   There was a youth orchestra playing traditional music near the park.  From Insadong it is a short walk to several other area sites."

We were able to spend two hours in this area shopping, eating, and marveling over the styles and culture of South Korea!  I wish we had more time!   Try the dragon breathe dessert!  It‚Äôs amazing-  corn starch and honey mixed and stretched over and over to get this mouthwatering treat!   I‚Äôd go back in a heartbeat!"
27,3.0,"Some souvenirs are made in China and the price is pretty expensive; some do not make any sense. Yet, the insadong street is quite good."
28,3.0,The restaurants and tea houses are interesting. Some of the shops are a bit tacky - typical tourist rubbish. Equally some were more interesting and people are friendly

31,5.0,"Insa-dong's main shopping street has everything you could want for souvenirs, many of good quality. Stop in Ssamzie-gil 4-story shopping plaza just off to the side while here. It's a ramped walk up in a spiral with shops off to the sides. There are info booths at both ends of the main street, closed to cars on weekends, so you can get information as needed. Lots of alleys to explore so plan for some time here."

37,5.0,"We try to visit different shopping areas (Namdaemun, Myeongdong, Dongdaemun, Gwangjang Market), but we always return to Insadong.  There is a great variety of stores there, the passage way is wide, so even when crowded one does not feel jammed in, restaurants are great, and there are cultural events held there.  We walked from our hotel to Insadong and there were pansori singing and traditional flute and drum music played.  Just a great place."
38,5.0,"Seoul is a boring city, nobody would deny that. Insa is the exception, as it is a quite authentic quarter with little restaurants and guest houses. Go into the side streets and enjoy food in a restaurant there."
39,4.0,"Some repeat merchandise for sale (largely in the tourist category), but also a good variety of interesting souvenirs and contemporary items such as jewelry, stationery, and modern art.  With a handful of eateries to boot, you could spend a few fun hours here."
40,5.0,"From shops, to mini dining areas to a number of cultural attactions. You really have to be here and experience it."
41,4.0,"Pleasant to walk around and full of restaurants, tea houses and art and gift shops of various types. It felt a bit touristy for my taste but was relatively relaxed and a contrast to the big pacy centre of the city. Be warned restaurants seem to close early here - we got caught out on our first night when we checked into our hotel from the airport at gone 8pm, virtually everything had closed by the time we went out in search of dinner just after 9pm."
42,5.0,"I was in Seoul only for one week but I visited this place 4 times during this week. This was great place for looking for some souvenirs and some Korean traditional stuff. I like this place very much and I went here 2 evening just walking and observing. There is a lot of very nice restaurants in near small food streets.I bought a lot of souvenirs for my family there like hand fan, yellow cooper rings and other stuff, hand made old paper cup, decorating tag, tea set etc..."
43,2.0,"May be i missed something, but it was pedestrian in every sense of the word.  You know it has lost anything quaint or charming when there is a starbucks cafe as you enter the street.  Rather uninspiring collection of shops selling either tourist garbage or otherwise same old stuff as any where else."
44,5.0,"Insa dong, an area or neighbourhood that is filled with little and bigger shops that sell and produce Korean arts and crafts. Huge paint brushes that are locally made. Some so big that you can use them to write poetry with water on the pavement . Stores where you can find old books and paper, places where you can try on  traditional  Korean clothes and have you picture taken all dressed up. Places where big and small drums are made and many more traditional objects. this area is a good place for tourists  to find real Korean souvenirs."
45,3.0,"Kind of a norm place, no really big attractions anywhere. Mainly shops on both sides selling traditional Korean crafts, calligraphy brushes etc. Some food here and there and in the alleys, need to speak Korean to get some really good service..."
46,3.0,"The main street in Insadong is lined with quaint old-fashioned craft shops, food places, and shops selling all kinds of wares. It was interesting to wander through it."
47,4.0,"Another shopping street but different, with more handicraft shops then other streets. Not too long but interesting."
48,2.0,"Insadong is one of the most famous place in Seoul, but lots of person and very expensive goods makes people feel tired. Especially, many visitors buy some korean traditional goods that do not have appropriate quality. Be careful when you buy something. However, good places to feel the korean style are there. Just you search a lot of things in there and see the many art works.Ïù∏ÏÇ¨ÎèôÏù¥ ÏÑúÏö∏ÏóêÏÑú Í¥ÄÍ¥ëÍ∞ùÏù¥ ÎßéÏù¥ Î™∞Î¶¨Îäî Ïú†Î™ÖÌïú Ïû•ÏÜåÏù¥Í∏¥ ÌïòÏßÄÎßå Í∑∏Î°úÏù∏Ìï¥ Î¨ºÍ∞ÄÎèÑ ÎπÑÏã∏ÏßÄÍ≥† ÏÑúÎπÑÏä§Ïùò ÏßàÏùÄ ÎßéÏù¥ Ï†ÄÌïò Îêú Í≤ÉÏù¥ ÏÇ¨Ïã§ÏûÖÎãàÎã§.

49,4.0,Enjoyed Insadong.   Had some great food and picked up a funky pair of glasses from a local manufacturer of frames.  I would go back to explore more as I only had 3 hours during my visit.
50,5.0,"Had a great visit and walked the area many times. Each time with a different purpose. Eating one time, coffee another, shopping a third, massage another, and just passing through another. It is great and safe. Decent prices and good food."
51,5.0,"Must do, rent a set of traditional Hanbok for free admissions to the palace, gardens/park, tea-sampling; quite an experience. Insadong to Bukchon is just a stone throw, well covered UNESCO sites with the 4hrs rental.Lots of tradition and influence of tis history. Prominently a very Buddhist environment with traditional architecture, pottery & ceramic, embroidery and houses that bore the streets."
52,4.0,Insadong is a must-go destination for anyone visiting Seoul for the very first time. It has an extensive array of shops and restaurants to enjoy. Went to a street art vendor and i got them to draw for me an exaggerated cartoonist version of SHINEE's Minho. My friend love it - LOLx
53,5.0,"Insadong is a really fun walking street/district filled with shops of pottery and various crafts.  Its a good idea to walk the whole street before purchasing, as many shops have similar products."
54,5.0,Invading is a fun and whimsical place to find out about cultural and historic things.  It is a very colorful place with lots of shopping with locals selling all kinds of goods.  Most people speak English and are extremely helpful.  Not pushy. Good restaurants also.
55,3.0,"We were told that this was the ""main market for souvenirs and traditional things"". We found a long street with many shops offering souvenirs or other art and crafts , not a real market and not cheap!"
56,5.0,"Some amazing hand-crafted art pieces here. Unfortunately there are tons of ""I Love Seoul"" type gadgets and other touristy things. There are several restaurants just off the main road, some in quite old buildings."
57,4.0,"Lots of shops, full range of prices and was fortunate enough to try freshly made honey and nut filled pancakes, cheap as but warning do not bite in too quickly as the hot honey will burn your lips! So cheap, so sweet you will enjoy!!!"
58,4.0,"Be brave. just wander the back streets. People here are very open to tourists, I got a lot of help with monolingual ordering, they take visa over cash, and the food is great."
59,3.0,"This road is a touristic trap, nice to walk by, but nothing special to focus on. The prices are reaching heaven hights and services are pure. No option for non-Korean food, and you have to really search for a hygenic clean place to eat."
60,4.0,I liked this place as you have lots of shops and cafes in this area. Did not buy much here as our guide told us you will get cheaper deals in Myeongdong.
61,5.0,"You can find souvenirs across the spectrum of cost and quality here.   If you stop no where else on your trip to bring things back home, stop here."
62,4.0,Had a short break from business meetings and had the chance to walk through. Good venue for Korean souvenirs most of which seem mass produced. A few exceptions stand out. Also interesting street food.
63,4.0,"Insadong is a place for tourists, but a lovely place to walk around and browse the shops. My favourite thing to do in Insadong is to visit traditional Korean tea houses, try the plum, citron or ginger tea."
64,5.0,"Lots and lots of tiny shops crammed with stuff that you don't need, but bring home anyways. I buy a coffee mug on every trip, and the one we found here may be one of my all time favorites. The salespeople aren't overbearing, just friendly. Prices seemed pretty good, and the selection was nice."
65,5.0,"Make sure you go down insadong 10 and turn left, down on the right is a shady tea garden with 6 local art galleries showing painting, pressed flower art, textile art and photography rotating every week or so. Also further back around insadong 5 or 7 the knife and sword museum, enter for 1000 won donation. Fantastic restaurant in the basement of the (double yellow upside down ""yy"") building. Open from 10am most closing around 8-9pm."
66,3.0,"Cheap, bargain shopping area. Crowded place. Mainly street shop. Lots of food outlets. Credit cards are accepted in most places in Seoul but if you want to shop in this area, take cash. You may not find money changer booths, instead you need to change your money in banks. Time consuming. You can also change money in hotels but rate is not so good. Better you change money at the airport. Saturday and Sundays are bank holidays, so if you need cash, there is no way to change in hotel. ."
67,3.0,"Like most cities, this is one of Seouls traps. It's nice but nothing to write home about. Easy to get to by metro, with many eateries - also if you into set, good expensive place for supplies."
68,5.0,"I visited as part of a tour the Saturday before Thanksgiving week so things were busy. There was an interesting blend of very exclusive shops - high end and very beautiful celadon, for instance - and cheap and cheerful. Quote touristy but definitely worth it, with some lovely eating places."
69,5.0,"It is a very nice place where you will see many Korean food restaurants, many coffee shops like Starbucks and other shops. It is good place for walking and discover Korea culture. My advice to you, if you want to touch the Korean lifestyle, visit Insadong."
70,5.0,"The whole street is packed with stores, galleries and restaurants that will amaze you especially if you love their traditional artcrafts. This is the place where you can buy small presents to bring home which is more cheaper than other places since you buy by bulk. Make sure to visit every shop sonce most of them sell different and unique pieces."
71,4.0,Nice place for local and chic shopping. Love the lovely mall. Nice Bibimbab underground. Cute cupcake with Poo styles.
72,5.0,Nice place to get traditional Korean art work for your home. We loved this place so much that we visited it twice during our visit.  Lots of great shopping and a decent place to eat. I highly recommend.  It is very difficult to acquire a taxi from here during rush hour.
73,4.0,Souvenir shops and restaurantsalley ways all seem to contain more restaurants-one wonders how they all survivetypical souvenir shops-worth visiting but certainly not a priority
74,3.0,"The street hosts some nice shops but also your run of the mill tourist shops. It is interesting to see the  sweet honey dessert makers. We also saw quite a few people in Korean outfits on their way to the palace (= free entrance). Tucked away off the main street are some really nice traditional style Korean tea houses. We were told this is a must while in Seoul, but if time is short you may as well skip this place. The palace and the presidents blue house are nearby, if you have a car."
75,5.0,"Lots of little restaurants tucked away in the alleyways, and some stalls selling local knickknacks, good for souvenir shopping."
76,4.0,"This is a famous street at Seoul, which very well known as a shopping street for tourist.  Here we can see so many store sell for souvenir and other stuff but a bit pricy because this is a tourist attraction.  Very nice street to visit and enjoy the atmosphere.."
77,4.0,"Not as big as Myeongdong yet more artistic and historic ( equally as commercialized though), Invading used to be the place where artists and officials hanged out due to its proximity to the Palace. It is a very nice walk throughout the area with great Tourist Info and free wifi- If you want some good art pieces then you can get it here but know that it will be pricey. Nice souvenir stores, local restaurants and shops, this area ( south of Anguk Metro Station and walkable to Myeondong is my favorite)."
78,5.0,The market lanes are interesting with a good range of goods as well as cafes. Some stalls have more unique items. The poo cafe was quite an experience. Also suggest the nearby music mall if you're at all musical - you will see millions of instruments and a huge range of musical equipment at this multilevel mall.
79,4.0,"In the city center, a lot of stores with everything you need to buy as gifts. Reserve at least 2 hours to have time for more stores."
80,4.0,"Lovely street with lot of souvenir shops. However price usually remains the same throughout. I didn't try bargaining, as the prices were reasonable."
81,5.0,"Full of galleries, shops, museums, food and life! A great place to spend a day in Seoul. Full of some of the best boutiques and art galleries, I recommend taking your time while here. Try some great food. Go to the Kimchi museum!! (Really, go there, it's so fun). There's so many cool shops and art. There's a definite ambiance here. The young girls dressed in traditional Korean clothing, street vendors, entertainers, and art make for a very lovely way to spend a day. Enjoy"
82,4.0,"This is the cultural street with lots of local Korean shops, performances by the locals and tea houses. You can bargain a little in these streets. Definitely visit this place."
83,4.0,"If you don't speak Korea this is good place to do your shopping and eating. If you are looking for designer copies you can get them all in one place, just ask. They are more expensive than in China but if you are in need you are in luck. You can also negotiate the price, the avarge discount if you pay cash is 10%."
84,5.0,"Went there around 7pm, walked the long stretch of road, soaked in the atmosphere... nice, less crowded, street lined with shop selling traditional handmade paper, arts, baskers (playing western music!!!) and traditional korean restaurant. Lovely!"
85,5.0,"If you are looking for Korean craft goods or antiques, Insadong is your place. It's pretty short actually but don't miss out on the little side alleys which hold a few hidden gems including shops and restaurants. Avoid the shops at either end of Insadong as they are rather touristy."
86,2.0,"Was here on a Friday night before 9pm but more than half of the shops were closed. Couple of shops selling bags and name stamps were affordable & more unusual, but the rest were mainly bakeries, cafes and beauty products shops."
87,3.0,Only if u have time to spare or craft intrested.Nothing much to see or do .better make use of your time
88,3.0,"A one time favorite, Insadong has become too touristy. The tea museums and restaurants are wonderful, but the shop prices have sky rocketed. Still a good place to go, but don't expect too much."
89,4.0,A good place for a Budget Friendly Shopping for Souvenirs & the variety is good with Budget happy goods...  Only wish more people could speak English...
90,3.0,"Walking distance from Changdeokgung Palace so easy to see on the same day. Walked around, had a coffee and did not find anything to buy. There were cruise tour groups dropped off in bunches and it seemed touristy to me, but still worth it because I got a good feel for local crafts and souvenirs. Allow an hour at most and you'll see plenty."
91,3.0,"Nice to walk around the main street, but nothing special for me anyways.Sovenirs stores are the same as any other place, though had a great hot dark chochlate at ddongcafe"
92,3.0,Plenty of local handicrafts and potteries. I checked a few items but found the prices to be on the higher side so did not buy much here. But good street to explore as a tourist
93,5.0,"Everything I love is here:  Art, craft, nice people, good food, beautiful weather in August...I could spend hours walking around, looking at many artistic shops with lovely flowers, small plans and...taking picture.If you are similar to me, you will love Insa-dong, Seoul!"
94,5.0,"Very beautiful area with many tourist attractions, the street food is excellent as well as some of the ""hidden"" coffee shops. good place to purchase souvenirs."
95,4.0,"Insadong, with the nice surrounding, the combination between art, shopping mall, traditional place and teh important things is Foods"
96,3.0,Walked a little but didn't enjoyed the shops: too many jewelry selling gold and some old watches. Lots of restaurants too. There are better areas in Seoul for tourist shopping....
97,5.0,Great for wandering and souvenirs. Also little authentic places to duck in for food. Worth a trip! You can do this and Gyeongbokgung Palace together easily
98,4.0,"Even with obvious tchotcke shops, if your style of shopping has nothing to do with ginormous malls, this place is for  you. Though you won't find bargains, per se, you can find lots of beautiful, hand-crafted and unusual things for yourself and friends who deserve something unique. There's also 2Cats Cafe, with lovely owners, and some street food."
99,5.0,Every visitor to Seoul should take the metro or a taxi to Insadong. Here is where you will find traditional crafts and also Korean souvenirs and other retail opportunities. The street runs about 8 blocks or so. Many good traditional Korea restaurants are located in the side streets off Insadong Street. Plan to spend at least 2-3 hours wondering through all the stores and trying some of the street food that is available.
100,5.0,Nice place to be with a friend and give some time with yourself. Lovely place good environment.What else?
101,5.0,"This was a very entertaining place to walk around.Many shops of a large variety, a good feel of the place, younger and older people walking the streets, and just a vibrant, exciting atmosphere."

104,4.0,Wide variety of shops. Staff seemed pretty helpful throughout.Easy metro access. Humming and vibrant

106,4.0,"We went there by Taxi from Gangnam, so many restaurant and shops. It is a really nice place to go when you re in Seoul"
107,4.0,"This area is great for an afternoon stroll of souvenir shopping and people watching. There brick and mortar stores have the antiques, but there are lots of stalls selling cheaper trinkets and what you expect to find in an outdoor market. If you're hungry, head down the alleys and you'll find a plethora of dining options."
108,5.0,This is an street where you can find very nice and typical craft of Corea and teas. You'll not get dissapointed. And is a safe place.

112,4.0,Pretty nice place to walk through... If you don't have much time and you want to buy some gifts or to eat local food this is a good place to start from.
113,3.0,One early Friday afternoon after work my business hosts drove me to this pedestrian shopping area to browse through the shops for trinkets to take back home. We strolled casually up the main street and checked out some of the shops and stalls outside. I managed to dig deep into my pocket to buy a postcard. But somehow I couldn't get inspired and eventually time got the better of us and we had to move on to our theatre engagement at 5 o'clock that same afternoon. I guess that if I'd had more time and a clear shopping list I could have made more us of this brief visit. Don't let my so-so review put you off coming here if you're looking for cheap souvenirs for the extended family & friends back home :-)
114,4.0,Very touristy but definately worth a vist. Very crowded at times but brave the crowds and try some traditional tea cafes to enjoy the experience.

118,3.0,"Supposed to be the 'traditional street of Seoul' but with Starbucks? Come on.It's got some interesting stores and traditional restaurants but I'd check out Samcheongdong, which is near Insadong. It has more to offer."
119,3.0,Typical Asian street market. Lots of souvenir shops. Definitely you have to negotiate prices. Street food is also available.
120,4.0,"Insadong is a cosy area full of small shops and nice restaurants. If you just have a couple of hours to walk around Seoul, it's a good choice!"

124,5.0,"I loved the small streets and unevenness of the little paved lanes, small lights illuminating restaurants. A sweet atmosphere to emanate from such a big city as Seoul is a truly nice. Loved the galleries and art shops - such a great collection of two things I love - local food and art!"
125,5.0,"Lovely pedestrian only street with lots of shops selling souvenirs, transitional arts and also modern artifacts and designs."
126,5.0,"Once my Significant Other found her way around Insadong, I had trouble dragging her anywhere else.  Dozens of charming little shops and even more charming little restaurants.  Clean, safe, less hectic than better-known Itaewon.  Even some good street musicians many evenings.  And a few museums and temples tucked in here and there.  Delightful!"
127,5.0,Great traditional Korean and fusion food in insadong as well as shopping for souvenirs. There is also plenty of cafes both serving traditional Korean teas and coffee! Also there are numerous boutique art galleries showing contemporary and trditional art and craft.
128,4.0,"This is a small alley but it is a present buyer's paradise.  It was here I found nice, small, and reasonably priced gifts for everyone on my list - from a woodblock print map of Seoul for the history lover, to a necklace for my goddaughter to a cute totebag for my mom.  It is a tourist spot - but hey! I was a tourist"

132,3.0,"A tourist street with plenty of shops, but it seems to cater to Korean tourists as much as foreigners. Worth a visit, but don't expect anything historical."
133,4.0,"If you are looking for arts and crafts or just want to wander around, Insadong is the pace to go. Don't forget to wander along the small alleyways where you will find lots of little restaurants"
134,4.0,"Nice place for tourists , Jogyesa is near by and this street  has a lots of antique shops which i feel is quite pricey .. Not sure if the antique collectors feel the same"
135,5.0,I liked Insadong for all the shops were down one street which was closed to traffic. Some great shops including some expensive antique shops. I sampled their Osulloc free tea and purchased to take home. I also purchased some of their hand made paper. Most of the shops allowed you to use their toilets without having to purchase things. A definite must on your stay. Allow 2-3 hours.
136,4.0,"It is a great place to grab your souvenirs, there was food all around, we just did not get any. Worth visiting."
137,5.0,"Really nice place to stroll and see old style Korean houses, lots of art galleries. There's a place where you can try a traditional Korean dress for 3$ or so."

142,4.0,A nice and easy walking /shopping street. Most people went there for shopping. A lot of tourists (as with all malls in Seoul)
143,5.0,"Insadong is where most of my gift shopping took place, but the area offers fantastic restaurants, traditional tea houses, street food that takes on a performance art flair and friendly shopkeepers! Bargain hunters can score here if thery're mindful, as many items that experience a high markup in fancy tourist shops can be found in humble street stalls for considerably less. Not to be missed!"
144,5.0,Very good options when it comes to authentic Korean food and reasonable priced shopping. Worth checking out.
145,3.0,"ok, this is that part of town that exists in every city. There are dozens of stores all selling the same ""handmade"" crafts usually at prices higher than anywhere else. The whole area is really about 3 blocks long and it does have all your requisite touristy things to buy. There are also a lot of street food vendors and restaurants."
146,5.0,This is a nice street on which to stroll with handicraft and antique shops as well as many eateries.
147,4.0,"This street is popular, safe, a bit touristy, but interesting.  I would recommend a couple passes through during your time in Seoul.  The restaurants offer lots of the ""must-try"" dishes of Korea and there are a scattering of traditional shops with seals, brushes and carvings that are more interesting sights than the imported Chinese bags and Korea magnets. Lots of smells to smell."
148,5.0,"A shopper's delight, wander along the main drag for souveniers, pottery, crafts. Don't neglect the side streets where more shops and wonderful little tea houses and restaurants can be found."
149,5.0,So this is where you are going to find any tourists in town!  It's a great street filled with all manner of small shops selling local crafts and souvenirs.  There are also a number of art and craft boutiques to visit which are worth the trip.
150,5.0,"For a unique Korean experience, vist a tea house in this area of Seoul.  Quite comfortable and relaxing."
151,4.0,"Close to Anguk station and the Metro. If you want to do some craft shopping this is the place. It took us about 1.5 hours to traverse the main shopping road, which is lined with many shops selling all sorts of traditional goods from Jewellery to bags hats and clothes.If you need to get gifts to take home this a good place to go."
152,5.0,"You can feel the Korean culture in the street particularly along the Ssamziegil (gil means street in Korea). There are many shops (to buy traditional souvenir), caf√©, restaurants (Korean style). It is worth while to look around. It is also located in the walking distance (10 min) from Gyeongbokgung palace. You can see both place at a time."
153,3.0,"If you are not familiar with Korean cultural stuffs, perhaps this will give you a glimpse, but don't expect anything authentic.  A lot of souvenirs are from China and there are few exhibit stores but pricy.I wouldn't recommend to buy Korean cultural arts here but foods are generally good and the area is very interesting to see.Also, there are several other landmarks are near by, so explore the area and stop at a cafe for a good Korean tea, you will be very happy."
154,4.0,"Its a lot different than Myeongdong. The place is rather upmarket, so our guide warn us that this is a no-bargain street. Good to hangout for the cafes and place to eat around there. Beware of stuck up Ahjumma whom is cold and dislike you for touching stuff inside her shop. But other seems okay. I didnt buy anything here as its a little expensive. we just eat round here -- the best grilled fish we had.its touristy, had a lot of seller spoke in my mother tongue. at least the basics..lol"
155,3.0,I like strolling through the streets enjoying all the street food and arts. Nice place to buy souvenirs. Absolutely love the traditional atmosphere.
156,4.0,"This is a good place to shop for everyone. Families, art and antique shoppers & those looking for kitschy little souvenirs to take back to friends & relatives. There are also many restaurants (go down the stairwells to below street level for many of the best).  Also, look for the vendors selling ice cream made with liquid nitrogen. It's a show as well as a treat!"
157,4.0,"Very nice and charming place to spend an afternoon, shopping or window shopping. Buy soveniors or street art at reasonable a price. Lots of eateries around."
158,5.0,"Well, I am not sure if it is authentic or not, but it is a neighborhood worth visiting. Go cruise through the small streets and alleys and get a real feel for Seoul. Good place to buy souvenirs. A short walk from the Gyeonbokgung palace."

164,5.0,"Small streets crammed with shops, caf√©s and so on, near to several of the main palaces.  Very interesting to look around."

166,4.0,Here is the place where you will find unique cafes and good coffees. Shop the day away for arty stuff here :)
167,5.0,"This is a must visit for tourists. The streets are full of little shops selling everything from high end art to little souvenirs. I purchased a beautiful print which was so well packaged for travel home at no extra expense. I also bought lots of little korean purses.There are plenty of places to eat and you can even buy a cocktail in a plastic bag - shopping and cocktails, you had me at hello!"
168,4.0,I really like Insadong. there are lots of shops to choose from but the area is less crowded than myeongdong. Lots of calligraphy stores and antique shops.
169,5.0,"Loved this place! Make sure to make this a priority visit when in Seoul. Tons of shops of every kind, and restaurants of every flavor. Stop and people watch...youll love it."
170,4.0,Insadong is a tourist area with lots of shops and restaurants. Wandering the side streets is a good break from ultra modern Seoul. With few must see sights in this city InsaDong is a nice break and a view into old Seoul!
171,5.0,A really enchanting place with beautiful architecture and artistic atmosphere. Perfect for souvenir hunting.
172,4.0,"fancy street, many shops, everything to buy, pretty mocal stuff, a very nice walk up to the palace, cosmetic, food, close, jewel, china"
173,5.0,Could say 'a little touristy'.  I would say great action and activity.  Place was buzzing and had a lot of fun.   Of course can tuck into many nice little restos and caf√©s.  Don't hesitate to spend a few hours sauntering down this nice little street and area
174,4.0,"You can walk to maijor places or take a taxi to most of famous shopping centre with low cost. I had stayed 4 nites at this area and quite enjoin with this location, especially at night you can take some local bbq food with Sochu Wine. This is also good place to buy sourvenirs for family or friends"
175,4.0,"There are all the tourist traps here, but it is still a nice place to visit, do some shopping, eat and  just stroll."
176,5.0,"Great place to walk around and buy souvenirs, also good street food.  Bring comfy shoes and you can walk nearby to the palace!"
177,5.0,"Such a nice area, I came back many evenings to stroll and dine. Lots of restaurants to choose from, gorgeous tea houses in traditional style and plenty of places to have a few quiet drinks overlooking the street.  Nice little shops along the way, most a little different to what you will find in the Hypermalls.  Only a short walk to the Royal Palace."
178,4.0,"While there is a fare share of tourist trash trinkets, there are also a few hidden gems of the main drag with true one of a kind arts and crafts."
179,4.0,"I was looking for a specific painting and directed by my hotel to take the trip to Insadong. Glad I did! The artist was located inside the subway and had just what I wanted. Only here can you find those unique cheap souvenir items without the hassle of other places.  If you are in Seoul, take the Metro rail or a cab. Lots of strolling on the narrow alley of bargains and grab a bite while there."
180,5.0,"If you only have a short visit to seoul, then this place will provide anything you need from korea.. souvenir shops, delicacy sellers(there's one lady on the street claimed she's famous with her rice snacks - a must try!), ginseng teas, art galleries, local korean food (if you don't speak korean, body language is accepted :)"
181,5.0,Excellent place for tourist to understand S. KOREA.
182,4.0,"A street full of art galleries Insadong, provides a enthralling snapshot of Korean culture for the tourists... A nice lively shopping area, where can enjoy shopping for souvenirs and other stuff based on local culture and traditions.. I bought some nice handmade toys for my 1 year old daughter and she loved it.. it really gives a nice feeling of being in a place with a culture in middle of beaming fast economic city.. Enjoyed strolling across the street while enjoying some nice Korean tea and ofcourse SOJU.."
183,5.0,"Perfect for shopping, eating, browsing - very cute area. Eat the soft serve ice cream you can find, go to Osulloc for some Green Tea tiramisu and ice cream (both of them oustanding), and get gifts. In particular Korean pottery, hand made paper and silk scarfs and pouches. Such a pleasant neighborhood."
184,5.0,"This is a very sweet street filled with all kinds of souvenir shops. You can find everything from traditional carved wooden folk masks, to personalized wax stamps, fans, duramagi (grey monk robes), etc. It's also just by the Jogyesa Temple which is a beautiful must-see!"
185,5.0,"Shopping, food, history... It's all here.  Outdoor mall.  Alleys full of food, sights, shops and attractions."
186,2.0,I had imagined a bigger street with many different shops and souvenirs but after 3 all looked the same.
187,5.0,"Ate at the ""Little India"" resto - priced extravagantly, but the ambiance must be experienced. Stop for a chai and snack. Plenty of variety for street food - safe! Plenty of local resto's - Thai, Korean, Japanese, Viet pho etc... Amazing art for sale, lots of manufactured crafts, but treasures can be found. Live music on the weekends. Clean. Central. Must see."
188,3.0,It is classical tourist trap far east style with many chinese knock off's. But on the other hand you can find authentic Korean artifacts and souveniers if you dig enough. Don't buy the fiest item you like keep on asking for lower price in the next shop! there is some real fine art galleries and tea shops if you have longer time...
189,5.0,"It is an almost 2 km long street filled with art galleries and souvenir shops. Definitely to see. You can find amazing posters, prints and artwork in the galleries. Also this street is #1 place to go for souvenirs of Seoul and Korea."
190,4.0,"This is a nice pedestrian only street where you can find almost anything from clothing, food, and souvenirs.  The price is affordable though not cheap."
191,4.0,"It's well worth finding time in the evening to have a wander around Insadong - an interesting collection of shops selling local products and eating places.  Amongst the high rise and neon of central Seoul, you get to experience a different side of the city amongst the narrow streets here."
192,4.0,It s a heaven for all my foodies out there. Ranging from restaurants to shopping malls- all Korean style. This is the place to be if you want to see Korea more traditional style
193,3.0,Great for people watching as well as checking out the wide range of merchandise on display. It can get crowded and you will need to do a fair amount of walking. You need to wear comfortable shoes.
194,1.0,"It all looks a bit touristic trap, not original flavour remains. Other closeby areas are much better."
195,5.0,"This is a good place for souvenir shopping as there are a whole lot of shops with local handicrafts, which is made in Korea and not China :-)Also there is Little India restaurant that serves Indian cuisine with an Indian ambience."
196,4.0,"This is a place mixed with cultural art and modern creativitiy, I think you should go there to take a look!"
197,4.0,"There are some nice shops in the shopping mall there, lots of accessories, and has a tax booth for convenience.  Also has a nice O'Sulloc teahouse which you can chill out at.  Highly recommended."
198,5.0,"Insadong is an excellent souvinier market. The feel of the market it very ethnic and yet it is inviting to the visitors. The insadong is a long street and offers many eating joints, Korean tea bars and cafes."
199,3.0,Not much to recommend Insadong besides one-stop shopping for souvenirs. The street is lined with stores all selling the same touristy stuff mostly made in China. A few nice stores selling prints and ceramics. Clothes are expensive and sized for petite women. A fun shopping mall with stores spiraling around a courtyard. Excellent and expensive tea shop. Try the green tea bonus to share with a friend.
200,4.0,"When I visited Insadong, it was quite cold. Even so, my work colleages were excited about the atmosphere of Insadong. We had a dinner at a Traditional Korean Restaurant, Hanjungsik, formal Korean cuisine. At Insadong, there were many street shops and we bought some yeot (Korean taffy). Another shop had dasic, which is traditional style, Korean biscuit. I hope that Insadong will reserve its Korean traditional elements."
201,5.0,Very live place with people walking everywhere. Most of them are eating or drinking something while walking with family and friends. Lots of small shops to buy small things and souvenirs.
202,4.0,"You can find a lot of traditional item in here.cheaper than myeongdong.Interesting think is I found one shop that the Korean can speak Indonesian, Japanese, Thai and other language.Need to check this place.."
203,5.0,It is always fun to walk between the small shops and art galleries.  There is a lot of nice stuff instead of just touristy crap that you find in so many other places.
204,5.0,"Nice art galleries with some of the most wonderful tea shops.  Venture through the small alley ways, surprises await."
205,4.0,Its best to go there early around 9:00 am when the souvenir shops open to get a good deal. Worth seeing the old post office and the Buddha temple in the vicinity.
206,4.0,"Yes, this place is kind of touristy, but I still love it.  I've done quite a bit of souvenir shopping here for my family.  There are terrific restaurants as well as street food vendors.  On Saturday this place is even better since there's a variety of street performers."
207,5.0,Great area for eating and shopping for crafts. This place has lots of little streets to be explored. Lots of street food and authentic restaurants.
208,4.0,"A Canadian expat told me about this street and I am so happy I was able to spend time browsing. It's a great place to find a wide variety of local products and crafts. Also I loved the narrow side streets with cafes and coffeeshops, wonderful for exploring."
209,4.0,"This is a nice neighborhood to shop for authentic Korean souveniers. It is not only visited by tourists, but also by a lot of locals. It is on walking distance from the Gyeongbokgung Palace."
210,5.0,"I really like how tourist friendly this place is. It is one of the places in Seoul where a tourist can travel to and not worry they will be ripped off. The prices in Isadong I believe are regulated. The vendors are friendly, helpful, souvenirs are well build, restaurants are generally clean and tasty! A must visit for tourist, plus remember to stop by a traditional tea house or restaurant for a local tea or cuisine."
211,5.0,"It is a cultural Mecca for the Korean and foreign visitors alike.  One may be instantly wary about its apparent commercialism: so many shops selling similar products, numberous restaurants and tea houses, shouting vendors and sales persons, etc. However, the very competition makes Insadong a place for everybody: There are restaurants in a whole price-scale, from cheap to expensive.  If you are looking for a rather economical food or drink, do not hesitate to meander into small alleys which are full of hidden gems.  They are proud to be there in the cultural Mecca, and the services are unfaillingly good to the cultural pilgrims like us."
212,4.0,It was a good experience browsing through stuff especially some the handmade craft and I would recommend to someone who does not have much time to go around other places. There was a large store at a crossing which had good souvenirs at prices that seemed reasonable. It is totally touristy.
213,3.0,"Great place to take mothers, wives and female children to purchase lots of traditional crafts like scarves, fans, tea, perfumes, etc.  Not a lot for mens."
214,4.0,I liked the fact that a touristy place like this still attracts so many locals. The restaurants in the back alleys must be good!Ssamzagil is a good arts and crafts centre and worth exploring.
215,3.0,"This market was too crowded with turists, and also the prices seem to be adapted mainly to Japanese turists. There are some nice pottery and art shops, but we found nothing that was worth buying at the price. The side streets, very narrow and full of restaurants are very interesting"
216,3.0,Got to go to Insadong if you are in Seoul even though it is a street for tourists.  Many interesting little shops to see and the best buy is the Korean Celedon Tea Cups.
217,4.0,"This little street area is nice for a stroll, there are a number of galleries, heaps of shopping (although most souvieners will be slightly dearer than more local markets), but well worth a wonder and stop for some street snacks."
218,5.0,"This is a very good place for tourist. The shops sell good touristsy stuff. When your legs get tired, there are scores of coffee places for a nice cuppa and rest.. including Starbucks."
219,4.0,"This is an interesting mix of shopping, from upper scale items, small private stores, to trinkets and antiques (or are they?). The street food vendors were plentiful and delicious, and one can spend hours browsing here. For new, fashion and electronics, stick to the Tower area and malls, but for unique and different along with quant, Insadong is one of may places, but probably the best."
220,4.0,"Insa-dong is a lively short stretch that has been the center of crafts, arts and tourist shops for some time.  It remains a worthwhile area to visit, stroll around, see interesting things but antike stores and galleries are few now making place for Korean designer stores - and more and more tourist style craft stores."
221,5.0,"The heart of the old Seoul and center for artists and anything creative.  Plenty of places to eat, good bakeries and many coffee shops.  Easy access from Anguk station."
222,4.0,"Vibrant street life, small shops, street food and restaurants... everything you might want to bargain for and take home as trinkets. Off in the side streets are (somewhat pricey) antique shops that deserve a look. We found that the real fun was ""people watching."" The stores, for the most part are specialized, for example, there's one for celadon, one for tea things, another few for women's fashions, and so forth. We enjoyed looking at the (probably mass-produced) Korean paintings for fans and wall art. The area is only a few blocks long, but what fun!  The pavement is somewhat uneven, so I'm not sure if it's really wheelchair accessible, but we did see many older people navigating with canes.It's a ""must see; must do"" when in Seoul, and that's probably why all the tours stop there."
223,4.0,"Picked up some lovely momentums of Korea here and you can bargain with the traders on what price you wish to pay.  If they don't wish to bargain with you, they will say!  Had a very short visit here as on business but would have loved to have stayed longer, as there are endless little shops, stalls and alleys to explore"
224,3.0,"Insadong, is the place where you could find anything traditional, traditional Korean gifts and souvenirs with low prices, take care you should argue for a better deal.Also you'll find there some cheap Korean food resturants"
225,3.0,Insadong is a walking street full of souvenir shops. The walk was fine and there were fun stuff around it ( we saw a street performance that was fun).
226,3.0,"Our tour guide told us she was taking us to the ""tourist shopping area"" and we were not disappointed. We picked up lots of little gifts and enjoyed walking through the streets and sampling street fare.  A fun afternoon."
227,4.0,"This area is a series of streets lines with shops of all kinds. We were there on the weekend, and it was fairly busy and we heard it can get packed with people. We saw a lot of traditional Korean art and craft items such as artwork, pottery and paper crafts. There is not any sort of name brand goods like at a mall. The prices were a little bit higher than what we saw in areas oitside of Seoul, but you can always negotiate with the vendors. The types of stores ranged from nice high quality goods, down to junky tourist trinkets. Also, there are a good selection of food vendors on the street. Overall, aneorthwhile place to see for a few hours."
228,4.0,There are so many interesting things to see here as a tourist. Walk off the main street into the many side lanes to explore ...
229,5.0,"Insadong is an area for traditional Korean hand crafts.  It is not cheap, but you can certainly find some really interesting traditional type souvenirs here.  There are some nice restaurants and tea shops (and a Starbucks) so it is a great area to wander around in, even if you are just window shopping.  In the evenings and on weekends there are also street vendors with very tasty Korean street food (safe - I've eaten tons of it and had no problems.  I highly recommend it!) and also some less expensive handcrafts.  I can usually find a few cute pairs of earrings or a nice scarf or two for 4000 won or less (about $3 US).  If something seems expensive, try another store or street cart.  Many of them have the same items and you can usually find one guy who is selling cheaper than the others."
230,4.0,Enjoyed watching the people and seeing the different products for sale. many of the stores have very similar products so it is worth shopping around a little to get the best prices
231,4.0,"This is an area in Seoul to buy antiques, and other souvenirs made by Korean crafts people.  You can also find the typical touristy stuff as well.  Lots of shops, and they try really hard to communicate with you when you are in the shop.  Can be a little pushy if you are not with a local."
232,4.0,"great place to eat and shop for souvenirs. the area is not so big, make sure you go into the small alleys, there many beautiful small restaurants hidden there."
233,4.0,This might be one of the more interesting places to explore in Seoul as a tourist. We came here with a friend of mine who is an academic at one of the local universities. His English is very good so we had a readily available tour guide. This was helpful but not essential if you have no such person upon whom to call. We found the shops to be varied and interesting and there are several good restaurants from which to choose if you want a bite. The atmosphere is a little different from other parts of Seoul as this area has a bit cozier and more retro feel. It is worth taking some time to explore if you are in Seoul with some leisure time available.
234,5.0,"Enjoyable area with shops and vendors.  Many artistic offerings as well as Korean handicrafts and souvenirs, both inexpensive and higher priced.  Deigner shops and wonderful show shops.  Lots of places to sit and relax - have tea or a snack."
235,3.0,"It's a tourist and artist street. Even the traditional cookie makers  and ice cream vendors perform. Once you resign yourself to that, let loose and enjoy the shopping. Some places were overpriced, and off on side streets one could get better prices and find more interesting artists, for which I did not mind paying more for. The work was incredible.  Food was priced ridiculously high. I recommend shopping and then going somewhere else to eat."
236,5.0,"There are so many interesting tea houses and shops in this area, that I went back a second time during my 4 days in Seoul. As an artist, I was particularly attracted to the paper goods and pottery."
237,4.0,"I didn't get to spend much time here, but there are lots of interesting things to do and great food.  I'll be back!"
238,5.0,"Especially fun on weekends, when the street is pedestrian-only, this is like a street fair that runs for many blocks, with lots of narrow side streets and cul-de-sacs offering hidden treasures. Everyone there is having a great time, strolling, shopping, getting a cool drink in a cafe and people watching. Hint: Try the local favorite PatBingSu, a sweet milkshake that can be customized to different tastes (fruit/green tea/coffee/etc.), but is usually based on fresh fruit. Best I've ever had!"
239,5.0,"This shopping area, tourist area was so much fun. This is where you can get the little gifts to bring home. Lots of stuff Korean. Great Korean food. Great area to people watch."
240,3.0,Always find something nice here. Don't forget to negotiate price. It's nice because it's not too large.
241,2.0,"Enjoyable, crowded, stylish, artistic, happening, colourful"
242,5.0,Great place to pick up souvenirs and gifts. Lots of Korean arts and crafts- from traditional to modern
243,4.0,"Strolled down the main Insa-dong street and spent less than 1.5 hours there .... so I'm sure I missed the hidden gems and more memorable attractions (would have loved to try the tea houses).  What I saw was less than I expected, because I expected a very traditional Korean village-like area with colorful architecture.  But that might be unfair .... I did enjoy walking past the wide variety of shops (too many souvenir stalls, though), and had a nice laugh with those fast-chatting/singing boys selling a type of white-honey-candy.  Plus, it's a treat to see the green Starbucks sign rendered in Korean writing!  With more time, I'm sure I could have explored the alleyways and visited more traditional shops and tried more local fare."
244,2.0,Tourist prices are three to four times more expensive. Go to Namdaemun market instead where you can find identical items for half or a third the price.
