0,3.0,"not much to see, we only went on the ground floor.Kpop group's hand prints are there. If you touch them, the screen will show a short clip of that idol. Some ""hands"" were not working anymore though."
1,3.0,"I think the best way to describe Star Avenue - Nothing special. Sure it makes for a good fangirling moment if your favourite idols happen to appear on the huge lighted screens or have their cut out boards available for photo taking anytime, but other than that there's really nothing special or unique about this place. We went there and we expected the screens to rotate the appearances of the stars only to be in for a disappointment. Only go either if you're a Kpop fan or if you have tons of time to spare after shopping at Lotte Duty Free upstairs."
2,4.0,"If you like stars like Rain , 2pm , Big Bang and JYJ , this place is worth visiting and checking out. Here on display are items used by the stars themselves, whether when they endorsed something or used during their concert. They have the hand prints of the stars there as well . =)"
3,4.0,"I enjoyed my short visit to Star Avenue, and was pleasantly surprised the entrance to the enclosed area is part of the Lotte World admission fee.  Had fun with the stand-ins, the recoding room, the motorcycle ride with Song Seun Hun and the dress-up as Ju-mong.  A good time if you are a Hallyu fanatic. I just wish they had more Hallyu Idols in the dioramas. Most of the souvenir items are sold in the upper floor of Lotte World dept store , the Hallyu fanatics will definitely have a field day here !"
