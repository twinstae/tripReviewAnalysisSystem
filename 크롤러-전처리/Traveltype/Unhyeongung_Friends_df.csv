0,3.0,It's called palace but it's not a palace. Just an old residence building. It's beautiful and free of admission.
1,4.0,"Nice little palace with a huge gingko tree greeting you upon entering the palace. Plenty of places for you to take pictures. However, the western building located behind the palace is closed for public which is famous for being Goblin's house (drama). So disappointed that we couldn't go in..."
2,4.0,"Very good value, as itâ€™s free, explanations were good and in English. We dressed in local hats, very funny"
3,4.0,"We particularly visited this place to see where the shooting scene of the famous Goblin Korean drama took place. It's called a palace but of smaller proportions compared to other palaces. It's quiet and pretty now that the flowers are in bloom (spring season). A portion of the area is closed for tourist (scenes in Goblin), but the outer area is open and it's shows you how they live in the past (rooms with everyday life depictions). It gave us a sense of serenity being in this place."
4,2.0,"Quaint remnant of what was once a larger palace complex.  We saw Unhyeongung on the map, so stopped in while on a walk thru the area.  Free admission, 30-45 minutes to see it all, including a small museum of ""relics"" and a few 'window' displays of clothing and way of life at the time.  Really, if you plan on seeing any of the other expansive palaces in Seoul, this site is not a destination you should go out of your way to see."
5,5.0,It's great to look around. The buildings are very nice. It's not as big as others in the city nor as colorful but it is worth seeing.
6,4.0,Right by Anguk St. Exit 4. Very small and peaceful museum. Entrance is free. Close to Insa-dong and some restaurants.
7,5.0,"Its free extraction place. You can see the culture of old Korean architecture and life style. You can try their traditional cloth as low as USD 3, and you can walk around with that cloth in palace area. They also offer self audio explanation about this palace."
8,5.0,The hanboks are available for rent for 3300won and there are great backgrounds to stand in front of and have a photograph taken.
9,4.0,I liked this place because I could try on a traditional Korean costume for a very low price and got to walk around the place wearing it.
10,5.0,"A definite must see palace - as the other reviews have stated it is not crowded with tourists and if you go in the morning there is barely anyone there. I was not even planning to go to this palace but the subway exit was located very close. I am quite a history lover so I loved the fact that there was an on site dresser that could transform you into a Queen, princess or guard for a fee of course. In addition there was mannequins and furniture which provided insight on how the rooms would have looked like. A major bonus was the fact that entry was free :) The only drawback would be its size it is not as grand as the other palaces but I think that is a positive because you don't get tired walking around. Plus, there is a couple of palaces nearby and there is the presidential palace to further explore in the area."
11,4.0,"Located near the vicinity of the grand palaces, Unhyeon Palace is not included in the 5 grand palaces of Seoul. It is actually a royal residence built for the prince regent. Much like the other palaces, the closest station to it is Anguk. But unlike the other palaces, this one has no entrance fee and open to the public. Being one of the least known attractions in the area, only a handful of tourists visit the place. Most of the people who go there are locals garbed in their native costumes for pictorials. Wedding photos are quite a common sight. Since I shy away from large crowds and touristy places, this was one of my favorite places to visit and is literally a few steps from where I was staying. Try to go in the morning as the place tends to fill up by midday. The grounds are not that extensive and may be seen for less than an hour."
12,5.0,"A small scale palace, the residence of the emperor's father - open for visiting and weddings are celebrated here too. We were very privileged to be guests at a traditional Korean wedding in one of the courtyards and one building in these magical surroundings.As most of the attractions in Seoul, this is free to get in and look around."
13,4.0,"Unhyeonggong is seldom listed among the list of Seoul's tourist attractions. It's a shame because Unhyeonggong is a compact but complete palace that anyone can easily navigate on his/her own after visiting Bukchon and Insadong which are usually on a first time visitor to Korea's bucket list of go-to places. Slightly smaller than Deoksugung, whose halls are rather empty, Unhyeonggong actually has props in the living quarters of palace residents (eg pillows and blankets in the bedrooms etc), and there's even a royal physician's clinic. In the palace courtyard, there is a couple dressed in hanbok (traditional costume) to pose for photographs with visitors. There is a traditional wedding ceremony reenactment but we missed the timing. The palace is closed on Mondays."
14,4.0,It's located just at the Anguk station exit #4. Admission free. There's a short video clip at the exhibition hall that provide information on this palace. It's a less visit place hence it's less crowded and more peaceful. But I find the place a bit small.
