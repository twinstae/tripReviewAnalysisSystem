1,5.0,Such a delightful visit. You must reserve in advance. Worth finding. Peaceful beautiful with excellent relaxed and informative tour. The view and going inside the buildings are brilliant
2,5.0,"Definitely one of the best attractions in Seoul so far. This private museum, despite its unassuming name, is surprisingly stunning and awesome. Perhaps the best-kept secret spot in the city. Iâ€™ve spent more than 1 month traveling around all the Korea peninsula and this is for sure one of her most impressive and interesting experience."
3,5.0,"This is definitely a hidden gem as the location is not accessible via public transport. The best way to get there is via taxi from the nearest train station. Prebooking of a tour is essential as it is only open for guided visit. If you love Korean architecture, you will surely be in for a treat. Not only are furniture pieces stunning but the architecture of the building and the landscape around the building are truly breathtaking. Awesome for history buffs too as the tour will give you a glimpse into the past."
4,5.0,"The name ""Furniture Museum"" is misleading as it is much more than that. I learnt about the history, architecture and culture of Korea.  Although I was the only one who signed up for the tour that afternoon, they still conducted the tour. The docent showed me around the various buildings and explained the different types of wood used for the furniture in the buildings. She also explained what the different pieces of furniture were used for. It was truly a great learning experience.Thoroughly enjoyed myself."
