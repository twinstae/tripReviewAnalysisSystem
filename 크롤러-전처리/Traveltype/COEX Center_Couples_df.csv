0,5.0,"The Coex is an exhibition and shopping centre. The stores range from top end retailers to department stores along with restaurants, a library and movie cinemas. It is a large centre with kids activities like LEGO playland and cafe at Brick Live. There is an aquarium and many hotels that surround and have entry into the shopping mall. There is also an airport check in if you fly certain airlines eg. Korean airlines or Thai, you can check bags in like you do at the airport. An airport bus leaves every 20 mins and you book tickets an hour before you want to leave. Price for the bus is 15000 won each adult, cheaper for children. Clothing prices aren’t cheap and if you want discounted clothing you need to go to the outlet shops. There are lots of coffee shops where you can buy food and beverages for around similar prices toAustralia. The library is big with floor to roof bookshelves and many Koreans come here to just read. A great place to visit."
1,3.0,It’s a mall but it’s big and pretty much has anything you would want to do including a theatre and an aquarium. Lots of tasty places to eat it at and of course who could forget the Gangnam Statue outside!! Also the library is pretty fantastic to stop at.
2,3.0,"We stayed at the COEX hotel so we took a trip underground to the shopping center. Cool gift shops and strange food, but otherwise just another shopping mall. I attached some photos"
3,2.0,"We visited this place multiple in the past and after the last round of renovations few years back, we decided to re-visit this time round.Besides the aquarium, this used to be a location of variety of small and large shops, food and items you can find probably elsewhere can be found here.It is now a glam map, with numerous ""anchor"" style stores but an empty feeling like ""just another mall - just larger"".A pity the renovation went the other way."
4,2.0,"Wear walking shoes and be prepared to get lost and be told by the information to go in clock directions.   Go straight at one o'clock for your escalator. It's been bought over by Shinsegae group and renamed the Starfield COEX but still an awful concept in planning. You need to spend 50,000 won to get an hour of parking.   It's hard to do that between two people for just food... Hyundai department store purchases don't count either.  Just an expensive mess."
5,2.0,"I have been to a lot of large malls in my time, including the Dubai Mall, but this labyrinth is a confusing hodge podge of hallways lined with stores, without any apparent structure or thought given to it. It is worse than IKEA for getting lost. The food court is a joke and embarrasingly small for such a large mall. Even when we gave up trying to find the store we wanted, which was so clearly marked on the info screens, we could not easily find a stinking exit out of the place. Of course there are lots of exits but they are not clearly marked and we contemplated using an emergency exit just to get the hell out. Heaven forbid should an evacuation ever be necessary. Unless you are being forced by the wife or girlfriend, I would highly recommend skipping this place. My god, Seoul is just full of shopping malls, there is nothing special here to draw you in, and wandering aimlessly in this maze just made me aggressive. Avoid Avoid Avoid!"
6,3.0,huge but not really convenient to roam around-many choices available to dine though-hot for K-POP fans to visit their idols at the SM museum nearby-
7,4.0,"This is a really nice convention center, sort of in the middle of everything south of the river. It's got some nice features, but the location is really what stood out to me."
8,4.0,The COEX center is a large convention center. If you're in Seoul you should check out the COEX schedule for conventions. They had an outdoor apparel exhibit while I was there. The grounds are nice and have some cool photo ops.
9,4.0,Cool place for shopping around.  A recommended place to watch 4d movies at the coex theater.  Parking is extremely tight and expensive so just ride the subway there.  The main convention center is great for auto shows or kid-themed animation shows.
