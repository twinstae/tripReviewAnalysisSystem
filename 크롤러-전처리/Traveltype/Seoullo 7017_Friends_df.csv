0,5.0,It’s a great opportunity to walk above the busy traffic and admire the city life in Seoul. No traffic lights at all.
1,5.0,"It’s a new highline with a nice skyline of the city, with free high-quality pianos standing around, cold water pool to cool your feet, and lots of flowers and trees. It’s well-designed and can be a romantic spot, but also perfect for families and friends. Definitely worth checking out!"
2,5.0,"Visiting this space above the chaos that surrounds Seoul Station is pure magic: the nature taking over the city and the way this walk to the market and the station has been created is the perfect spot to visit, not only for architects or architecture lovers, but also to appreciate Seoul in a different way."
3,4.0,as you can see from other reviews this attraction will not amaze you. It's the place for those that like to walk and take in the view. If you are in the mood for a  stroll it offers a nice view of  downtown Seoul and if the weather is nice can be a good spot to enjoy the sunset. We walked from the Seoul Station down to Namdaemun market.

5,4.0,Went today with my brother. Nice refreshing place. Spent some time there. Wish for more places like this. Enjoyed the stroll and talk there amidst the pace of this city.
6,4.0,"This park is situated on a bridge, just like highline park in New York. There was a pool where you could take a footbath, very nice when you have walked for an entire day. They also had small cafes where you could buy ice cream. Its not a park where you stay for hours but its nice to visit if you are in the neighbourhood."
7,4.0,"From our first stop which is the Seoullo Information Center up to the Seoullo Shop all the staff are very friendly and has a sunny disposition. At first Seoullo 7017 may just look like a bridge adorned with a variety of flowers and plants, but as you go about the tour you discover that it has a lot to offer. It has halls that caters to various activities such as art exhibits. It has food shops to cater to your hungry tummy like Magnolia Cafe, Rose Bingsu and Hydrangea Bread (the lemon iced tea is so refreshing). Bibimbap at 7017 Seoul Bibimbap is delicious and just like the typical Korean serving,  it is big for our small tummies. :)  We had a hard time choosing a souvenir item at the Seoullo Shop because of the many choices - pens, shirt, tote bag, mug, etc. It is recommended that you go here on an early morning or late afternoon to evening as it is too hot during our visit."
8,5.0,"The walkway was just opened for two weeks, but it is so relaxed walking on the ex-car way. You can take the beautiful photo of the busy traffic from the bridge as well as be watching the trains getting in and out the Seoul station. more than 20000 plants are on the road but they are mostly newly planted so it may take a few years for them to grow. There are several shops and information center on the bridge and the staff wearing a green striped shirt. They are very helpful and some of them could speak several languages as the are international students studying in Seoul. The walkway is quite windy some time but also hot at noon. Some water facilities and restaurants are installed so you can cool down and take some rest. It is a good connection between the Seoul Station and the area of Myongdong."
9,1.0,Went on the grand opening. Crazy busy. All the plants were dying. Expected it to be like the High Line. Don't waste your time
