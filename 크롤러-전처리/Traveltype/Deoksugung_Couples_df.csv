0,4.0,This is a much smaller palace as compared to the grand Gyeongbokgung palace and is in the heart of the city. We landed there just in time for the changing of the guards ceremony which is again not as elaborate as the one at Gyeongbokgung but is still nice. (You can watch the ceremony from the street. You need a ticket only to enter the palace grounds). The visit does not take much time as the palace grounds are small. The guide pointed out to us some of the structures dating back to 1600
1,5.0,What a beautiful palace to visit at night. We stayed 5 minutes walk from the palace and was reading about the palace being open during the evenings. Definitely highly recommend an evening visit. It had a romantic atmosphere and was lovely to visit as a couple. Entrance is 1000 Korean won per person. The grounds houses a art museum and some modern art installations are visible on the site. Made even more special once lit up. As the palace is situated near the city hall and I the heart of the built up city the tall skyscrapers are even more visible at night when they are lit up with their neon lights. Spectacular blend of old with the new modern backdrop. Will definitely return during the day. It might be the smallest palace of them all but I would definitely recommend a evening visit as you will experience it in a way you cant see the others.
2,4.0,"The palace, directly across the street from the Seoul City Hall and easily accessible using Exit 2 from the metro City Hall stop, is worth a 2 to 3 hour visit -- especially if one is a senior (65+) for which it is free of charge. The well preserved buildings interesting, as is the art museum which focuses on Korean painters -- a genre which is unfamiliar to many westerners (also free for seniors). Planning your visit around the changing of the guard ceremonies is prudent, as well."
3,4.0,We didn’t go inside the palace but watched the lavish and dramatic changing of the guards at 3:30 (I think the other times are 12 and 2pm but check that if going). We get lucky enough to try on free Hanbok costumes to experience the change of the guards and pose with the guards after their ceremony. The whole thing lasted about 20 minutes and there were explanations in English. The outfits were colourful. There’s a huge drum that’s beaten too.
4,5.0,We went to Deoksugung. We were very lucky to be escorted by a volunteer guide. He was 16 years old and spoke good English. He took us through the various buildings of the palace and gave us a detailed explanation of the uses of the buildings and the history. This place was not to big and it was an excellent experience. Definitely worth a visit
5,5.0,The changing of the guard ceremony takes place outside of the palace grounds in a small courtyard next to the sidewalk. You are very close to all of the participants who are in very colorful costumes.  Great for photos! The park like setting inside the gate is very peaceful. Hard to believe it just off a busy street.
6,5.0,"The ground was not as big as Changdeokgung palace but it was one of our most enjoyable places visited in Seoul mainly because we were given free guided tour and we were also allowed free use of hanbok, the traditional South Korean dress. After the Royal Guard changing ceremony, there was announcement to  encourage picture taking with the palace guards which we did while wearing our hanbok.Tip:Changing of the guard ceremony is held at 11:00, 14:00, and 15:30 closed on Mondays. Try to get there at least an hour before the changing of the guard if you want a free guided tour. We were there just after 10:00am where we saw this youth group who are offering free guided tour. At this time, the group managing the free hanbok were not yet available. We took the tour which was only the tour guide and myself and my wife so it is practically a private tour. The guided tour took about 45mins.After the tour, we went out of the palace and proceeded to the stall of the group that is offering free hanbok. We registered, and was fitted with hanbok - both my wife and myself. We were wearing the hanbok during and after the changing of the guard ceremony and took plenty of pictures of us wearing them.Please note. The stall for the free guided tour and the hanbok experiences are NOT inside the palace. They are at the left front side of the palace gate."
7,5.0,The scheduled Changing of the Guards was cancelled due to fine dust warning issued by the government.But the whole palace itself is a good attraction to visit.
8,5.0,"It was a strange feeling because it was deoksugung which had come decades ago.  after the emperor Gojong was abandoned by the pressure of japan in the palace history guidbook, he lived here and was called Deoksugung palace. the name of the palace is not pleasant. However, we was doing the gate changing ceremony to remember tttttthe dignity of the palace. when the king was inhabited, could we go to the royal court as easily as we do now? the couple gave free admission togethere as a national merit."
9,5.0,"This is probably the smallest palace in Seoul. But what you go there for is the changing of the royal guard ceremony. It happens right outside the gate so it's free. The ceremony takes place every 11am,  2pm, and 3:30pm. Be there 10-15 minutes before so you can get a good spot behind the cordon. They give you time to take photos with them too. Going inside the castle, you'll need to pay 1000 won (youth 500 won). Unless you're wearing a hanbik, then it's free! Some areas wereunder renovation when we visited. You need to walk around the palace and take photos in their stone walls!"
10,4.0,This palace is very easy to get to from the Seoul metro.  Changing of the guard is scheduled several times a day.  The guards pose with the tourists after the ceremony.Open and main building are lit at night.  Grounds have beautiful trees and walking paths.
11,4.0,"This palace and the surrounding grounds are much smaller than the nearby Gyeongbokgung Palace but it is still worth a visit if you have an hour or so to spare.We arrived just as the changing of the guard ceremony was starting (11am) which takes place just in front of the main gate. There wasn’t such a big crowd so we had a good view of the ceremony. After that we took a walk around the western-style garden and the interesting buildings in different architectural styles. Part of the site was under renovation but there was still plenty to see, including the Modern Art Museum."
12,4.0,"This was the first temple we visited in Seoul and really enjoyed it. It's a pleasant place to explore and its quiet, given it's located in the centre of the city. The architecture is lovely and tranquil. Do try and come both by day and night as its wonderul when lit up too. Well worth a vist to see the beautiful buildings."
13,3.0,"Didnt go into the Palace , but watched the changing of the guard at 11.00 hrs. Nice to watch with commentary in Korean, English and Chinese and Japanese.Dont panic about trying to get a good close up picture of guards, at the end of the ceremony, the ropes come down and you can take photos and walk in amongst them.Little great toilets in Berrys and bean on your left.......make sure you buy a coffee!"
14,5.0,For a small area the site has a surprisingly large number of interesting building to visit and at night they are beautifully lit.
15,4.0,"Deoksugung is a lot smaller than the other Seoul palaces (Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung) but it's still worth visiting. It's much more quiet and offers a break from the city on a hot day. Take you time and sit around for awhile, observing locals and enjoying the scenery. Since it's centrally located, Deoksugung also offers great views of traditional palace buildings with a bunch of modern skyscrapers in the background - a combination of old and new that makes Seoul so interesting."
16,3.0,"We visited as we had a little time and were in the area. It is cheap to visit, but there isnt much to see compared to the other palaces. The changing of the guard ceremony is fun to watch and there is an explanation of what is happening in English. There is some information about the buildings in English but not very much. I would say it isnt worth going if you only have a few days in the city, but stop by if you will be around for a week or more."
17,4.0,We were fortunate to arrive just as one of the guard changing events was happening at the gates. Very colourful though take the authenticity with a pinch of salt - one of the 'guards' with moustache and pointy beard was definitely a womanInside it is a delight though not exactly packedWe spent an hour there which was sufficient
18,4.0,"This grounds of this palace are much smaller than most of the others in the city.  Entrance is only 1000kr, however despite the bargain price this place is relatively empty.  This allows you to stroll the grounds and take numerous photos without the hoards of tourists, which you will find in the other palaces."
19,4.0,"We visited it just before sunset, it was our only palace to visit at night, different view and Colours at night. We are unaware if you can visit other palaces at night. We would skip it if they do not open the door at night and illuminate the palace."
20,4.0,Very nice and historical temple. Many things to see and nice areas to just walk around in. Definitely a must when you visit Seoul.
21,4.0,"Long queues .Booking would be recommended. We were in the queue for over half an hour and it not protected from the weather.Palace interesting but the highlight is the changing of the guard, which is worth watching.The palace is well maintained, and many young Koreans tend to wear national clothing which makes a colourful background."
22,4.0,"Had the opportunity to witness the change of guard. Steep in tradition, the colours were just beautiful to watch. The palace was beautifully built, location was super convenient. A beautiful experience in Seoul."
23,4.0,"This palace was very near our hotel and close to City Hall which is one of the most active places on weekends.  We strolled the grounds which, while not as impressive as those at other palaces, were pleasant.  The Changing of the Guards is colorful and impressive and is worth scheduling your time to catch."
24,4.0,"The regular changing of the guards ceremony is worth seeing, with an English language commentary. A very convenient location just across the road from Seoul city hall (and the city hall itself is worth visiting, the basement had an archeological display). As for the many temples we visited one tends to forget the specifics of each palace. I remember that one of the palace buildings had an organised tour (only way to get in) but this needs to be booked in advance. By the way I was entitled to free entry to many of the palaces and temples due to being over 65, a great deal! Worth a visit and easy to get to."
25,5.0,"We took the subway here and exited at City Hall station. It was a smaller palace complex but nice nevertheless. We came around lunch time and were fortunate to be able to witness the changing of guards ceremony here. It was a very colourful affair. Entrance was KRW 1000 which we reckon was cheap. As most of the main palaces were near each other, you can actually walk from one palace to the other, if you don't mind walking."
26,3.0,"Nothing special unless you have the time and walk with a guide.This was the last palace we have visited, maybe we had enough....."
27,5.0,"We didn't go in with the intent of doing a tour, but checked the times when we entered and figured we'd hit up the cafe/souvenir for some hot citron tea before wondering before the tour started.It ended up being just the two of us for the english tour. THe knowledge imparted on that tour was worth more than what we paid to enter the palace. It gave the palace life and tangible history, a profound sadness and added to the beauty of what was once a royal palace during times of turbulence."
28,4.0,"We visited many similar palaces all over the city where there were hundreds of people rushing about.  This palace was different because it is smaller, less visited, and peaceful.  A great place to visit in the evening.  Trees were blooming as well.  Very cheap to enter at KRW 1,000."
29,5.0,"Deoksugung Palace is a relatively modern royal palace closely associated with King Gojong under oppression by Japanese rulers. The palace has classy buildings and ground as well as wooded areas. Although this palace is not as popular with foreign tourists as Changdeokgung Palace and Gyeongbokgung Palace, this Deoksugung Palace is well worth a visit especially because it is so conveniently located in the city center across the City Hall, acting as a peaceful oasis for relaxation and reflection. You can also visit National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in the palace compound.The Changing of the Royal Guards take place in front of Daehanmun (Gate), which is quite colorful and popular ritual for many visitors and passersby. Metro stop (City Hall Stop) for Lines #1 & 2 as well many bus stops are close to the palace gate."
30,4.0,This palace is a definite to see if in the area. The compound is relatively small so you would only need to spend an hour or two here. Pretty gardens and nice quite spot in the heart of Seoul.
31,4.0,Another one of the great Seoul palaces filled with grand colourful structures. If you have seen the others and pushed for time you could skip this albeit on a smaller scale. However the guided tour was informative and made the visit interesting. Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
32,4.0,"Two reasons to visit Deoksugung Palace - it's centrally located next to City Hall right in the middle of the city, and it's less crowded compared to its bigger and more illustrious siblings. If you only have 1 hour to spare and would like to experience a Joseon Dynasty palace, this is it. At only KRW 1,000 entrance fees, you not only get to experience this, but also to witness the Changing of the Palace Guard ceremony (at 11 a.m) and explore the beautiful western-style architecture of Seokjojeon Hall and its lovely fountain garden."
33,5.0,"It was the first palace we went to and it didn't disappoint. We got lucky to go around 11am to witness the changing of the guards ceremony. Inside the palace is windy so it's relaxing to walk even if it's so hot in the afternoon. We went there in the 2nd week of June, it's summer already. Not that big compared to Gyeongbokgung."
34,4.0,We stopped by to see the elaborate changing of the guard ceremony and have a tip.  View from the street side of the roped square for best pictures without commercial store or kiosks in the background.  You will also be able to get a better shot of the drummer and get in the square when the ropes are let down for a picture with the colorful guard folk.
35,3.0,Nice temple although not the nicest in Seole. I loved the arcitecture construction. Around all places in the center of the city.
36,5.0,"We really enjoyed the free one hour drumming performance, and we're lucky to catch the end of the changing of the guard, which happened around 11.30."
37,3.0,"I'm not sure why it's listed as a separate attraction since it's part of the palace, one of many buildings in the palace. The buildings are replicas and are empty. The story we were given is that they are afraid that if they furnish the place, the furniture could be used as weapons."
38,4.0,"I would do Gyeongbokgung Palace and Changdeokgung Palace first. If you are then still keen on yet another palace, Deoksugung is a good choice. Much smaller than the other palaces, it is rather more intimate and there are less tourists. Also, it has not been rebuilt so the atmosphere is more historic than at Gyeongbokgung."
39,4.0,Recommended for families and couples who do not like shopping. Great place to learn about korea culture and history while taking in the scenic views.
40,5.0,The palace is situated near the City Hall Metro Station with some historical buildings and colourful trees. The parade of royal guards is held 3 times per day at the main entrance of the palace. We had an enjoyable time visiting this palace.
41,4.0,"Seoul has many of them, this one is right next to the city hall, fee is less then a 1 euro, and you get a free 40 minute english guided tour, very nice. With guide is better, they has as well the change of the guard, which is interesting. Inside is as well a museam which has a extra charge if you want to go.Worthwhile to visit if you have time and the weather is nice"
42,4.0,"We visited this beautiful place by night on our way back to our hotel. It has a palace with a central court, a bell building and a fountain. It is one of those that has been destroyed during the Japanese colonization and currently only a third of the original building is left, but what is left is worth seeing."
43,5.0,Got some lovely photos of this palace. The buildings are beautiful and the grounds are lovely to stroll around. We spotted a couple taking their wedding photos in traditional garments. It's free to enter if you dress in traditional clothes too.
44,4.0,"Its strongly recommended to buy combined ticket for all the palaces (5) - 10 000 W and try the guided tour. Its free, all guides speak fluent english and explain all that you can see. Palace seems similar to other ones so Its really useful to have a guided tour which explain all the differences and show you what makes this one really different from the other 4."
45,3.0,"The palace itself is not very impressive, but the change of the guard is something. It takes place outside the gate. Well worth to see. Nearby are other attractions like Seoul City Hall and the end of the Cheonggyecheon stream. Not far from the Gyeongbokgung palace"
46,5.0,"This palace has a show of costumed Korean guards in front of the gate.  Fun. Entering the gate is only a couple dollars.Inside is  a very interesting and characteristic collection of ancient buildings (reconstructed), statues, an arbor and a  fountain.  Walking on the grounds is peaceful with pathways through the trees.  Finally, for extra admission, there is an art museum at the far side with very good exhibitions which change regularly.  Modern, traditional, western and Korean art are displayed in various large scale shows throughout the year in this awesome space."
47,4.0,"Besides the palace, you can also visit its garden, fountain and modern homes. The changing of the royal guards is a must-see."
48,4.0,"Different to other palaces - many different style/age buildings, and the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary art is up the back. The grounds themselves are beautiful, well worth an afternoon stroll and rest from the hectic pace of the city."
49,4.0,Deoksugung was strikingly more modernized with foreign embassies. It also has a guard changing ceremony 3 times a day. It's close distance to city hall makes it easy to drop by to visit. I had the combination ticket to all 4 palaces so I came by to visit this one as well. There are 2 English tours per day. Check the website for timing.
50,5.0,"We didn't end up visiting inside the Palace as we arrived in time for the 2pm changing of the guard ceremony and discovered it was actually done out of the street. Very colourful with pomp & ceremony. The drummer was a highlight, such a powerful swing! At the completion of the ceremony the public were invited to take photos with any of the ceremony participants. Fantastic & free. Thank you Seoul!"
51,5.0,"A wonderful place to just wander around and feel relaxed. Was very well priced, less than the price of the subway. So it's definitely the place to go where lots of local children are also exploring their culture and history. My husband and I were here mid morning just missed the free English tour but that's ok. You can feel the history inside the walled residences. Also hang out for the procession it's pretty spectacular."
52,3.0,"We understand that this is the only royal palace which can be visited at night, illuminated. OK, we saw it by daylight. Japanese invaders did a fairly thorough destruction job and we could not visit the Western-style building as it takes only groups of 5 people at a time on a first come first served basis – and we were #7 and 8. As Seoul royal palaces go, this one is certainly not a must, but the very colorful procession of the changing of the guard, three times a day (11 am, 2 pm and 3.30 pm) is certainly worth the sight. The procession crosses the premises from the Western-style palace and heads for Daehanmun Gate, close to City Hall, where they perform some martial movements rhythmed by drum beats – a popular photo op, the more so that visitors are invited to join the guards for pics at the end of the show."
53,5.0,"The Palace is a walled compound that was inhabited by members of Korea's royal family during the Joseon monarchy (1392-1910) until the colonial period around the turn of the 20th century.  It is one of 5 ""Grand Palaces"" built by kings of the Joseon Dynasty.  It is popular for its daily Changing of the Royal Guard ceremony and is an excellent opportunity to photograph native costumes."
54,3.0,"As with all the Seoul palaces, this place is majestic and peaceful. The only issue with this one compared to the others, is that most of the information signs were only in Korean, and this turned us off going to other museums."
55,5.0,"Very close to city hall, this palace is very peaceful.  We had a free tour which explained a lot, and the changing of the guard ceremony was very colourful and interesting."
56,4.0,"We were just having some nice photo ops on the square of city hall when something caught our attention. It's the changing of the guard by the gate with their traditional colourful costumes complete with spears and flags. It was a good opportunity to have some photos taken with the guards which they offered to tourists even if you don't enter the compound. Nevertheless, we did and with a very cheap entrance fee who wouldn't (W1,000)? The garden that adorn the buildings are a great space to relax and enjoy looking at all the traditional Korean and European style architecture. There's a central water fountain in front of the museum and one interesting object that caught my attention was the sun dial which gives a very accurate time that I've compared with my iPhone. The museum charges an entrance fee but the other one is free but you need to book an entry online for they only limit the capacity. To get there, you have to get off from City hall metro station and exit next to the palace. There are several palaces nearby to explore too so enjoy it if you have time!"
57,5.0,"The entrance to the Palace grounds is a canopy of cherry blossoms. Allow at least an hour to visit the many buildings. There is a separate art museum which charges an entrance fee. We got to see the paintings of a Korean artist, which were stunning.There was a concert of popular Korean music given on the grass in front of the museum.There is the possibility of visiting the Palace rooms. This takes a special ticket for which the concierge at our hotel arranged. It may be possible to arrange this per Internet. There is no additional charge to visit the Palace, but a reservation is essential."
58,4.0,"You can't help but notice when visiting this ancient Palace that you are surrounded by modern day high rises in the heart of the city.  This was a very popular Palace for school children to visit as there had to be several hundred children on site.  The grounds are very nice and much bigger than expected.  There is a mixture of Western and Korean architecture.  Make sure to grab the brochure expaling everything at the entrance way.Definitely worth a look.  Very cheap to get in, only 1,000 won but free if you are 65 or older."
59,4.0,"smaller than gyeongbukgong, but the royal guard changing ceremony is more interesting. there's a russian museum inside that apparently need advanced booking, so we only get to see from the outside"
60,5.0,"This Palace, one of four major Palaces in the same vicinity in Seoul, is pretty much directly opposite City Hall, and there's a metro station at City Hall, so it's easy to get to and find.This is a smaller Palace than some of the others, and has a few more later-built buildings, so is quite distinct from the other Palaces.The Palace guards are interesting to see and photograph, and you don't have to buy a ticket to go into the Palace to see them, as (for obvious reasons) they are on the outside of the gate.  They are used to having their photos taken!As a consequence, you can also see much of the changing of the guards from the street too, free of charge (much like Buckingham Palace).  And the changing of the guards at Deoksugung (and at Gyeongbokgung, not far up the road for that matter), has just as much pomp and ceremony, with colourful uniforms and a marching band, as Buckingham Palace or Horseguards.  Well worth a look if you can time it right."
61,4.0,"Deoksugung being the latest palace built, the buildings scatted throughout the huge ground were very functional.  Instead of the traditional building of ceremonial displays, this palace has open room in serving for the purpose of daily activities.  The gardens surrounded the palace are very well landscaped and can be maintained with minimum labor.  However in walking through the various gates between the courts, visitor must be aware of the low ceiling that easily knock one's head if not careful."
62,4.0,"Unfortunately, we missed the changing of the guard, but it's a beautiful palace for sure! Definitely worth going to, even in the dead of winter! I recommend it."
63,5.0,"Exclusive and free experience that you can watch in front of the palace's gate. Just curious that some performer are westerner dressing in an old traditional Korean guard uniform, I found it a bit strange."
64,4.0,"It might not be the most impressive of the palaces in Seoul, but it's still worth a visit, and entry really doesn't cost much at all. You probably don't need to spend much more than an hour there, and definitely not more than two, but the architecture alone is worth the price of admission, even without taking into consideration the historical importance of the palace. Signs are in English, Korean, Japanese, and Chinese, so almost any visitor can learn about the historical details."
65,5.0,"This palace is nearby cityhall and good for take a rest from crowded seoul. In addition, can feel the real historic palace."
66,4.0,"Deoksugung is a nice palace that is surrounded by tall buildings and a bustling city. This place is a quick walkthrough compared to other palaces in Seoul, but it's worth a visit if you have been to the other palaces."
67,4.0,"Deoksugung (₩1000 for adults) is one of the Five Grand Palaces of the Joseon Dynasty, located next to Seoul Plaza and City Hall in the city centre. Opening hours are 9am to 9pm (closed Mondays). This palace served as the residence of the Royal family twice, during late 16th century and then again at the turn of the 20th century, providing well preserved buildings of traditional Korean and Western architecture. Here you will find a collection of traditional Korean style entrance gates, lovely inner courtyards, worship and residential halls, pavilions and landscaping, all quite similar to what you see at the much larger Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung Palaces. You can also watch  Changing of the Guards ceremonies here at Daehanmun Gate.  Two unique inclusions at Deoksugung include the Western style buildings at Seogeodong Hall, which was built in European style in 1910, and the adjacent building used to house the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (MMCA) - Deoksugung branch.  One of the things we very much enjoyed about visiting Deoksugung during the autumn was the fantastic fall foliage display seen throughout the palace grounds. There were numerous spots where we found multiple colours of tree leaves that made for lovely photographs. The autumn scene here was considerably more impressive here than at other palace grounds visited during this trip to Seoul. We were however, disappointed to find the MMCA Deoksugung Art Museum closed during the time of our visit. There was no indicated closing on the MMCA or Deoksugung websites nor at the place entrance, which was odd.  Overall, we quite enjoyed spending time at the Deoksugung Palace. Not only was it  exceptionally beautiful this time of year, but, we found it more management a place to visit compared to larger palace grounds around Seoul. You can comfortably browse Deoksugung in 30-45 minutes or longer if you want to visit more leisurely.  This is a very good and cheap attraction visit to consider making during trips to Seoul."
68,5.0,"Beautiful place and interesting ceremony of changing of the guards, sad to say I could not really understand the English accent of the commentator who would switch from Chinese to English. But these are quiet and picturesque grounds in the middle of a busy city. Had a lovely time walking around with my husband and enjoying a quieter part of Seoul. Went to the Museum also located inside the grounds. Free to enter.Go to City Hall station, Exit 2."
69,4.0,"This is a nice place, but there areBigger palaces in the city. 1000 won very reasonable admission. Nice to take a stroll down to Myeung Dong area from here."
70,4.0,This is also known as Gyeongun-gung Palace. Its one of the 5grand palaces built by the kings. It has garden forested around and also has a square with the statue of King Sejong the Great!
71,4.0,"Since I went to this place on Chuseok, it was actually surprisingly free of charge! I suppose it was a kind of promotion? I hear it's 1.000 won on other days, which is about 80 American cents by today's conversion. Regardless, while wandering around Seoul trying to find places to visit over the busy Chuseok holiday, we ran into the Deoksugung palace, and though we couldn't go inside the palace part itself - which is fine, as many palaces tend to look very samey - we were able to see the royal gardens (uninspiring as they were), the sundial next to the big, beautiful fountain in the pond, and the art museum. The art museum was the best part, along with taking a picture with the guard standing at the entrance to the whole attraction. :D"
72,5.0,We watched the changing of the guards. The walk along the tree lined path was lovely along the way to see all the cravings on the buildings . At the end was a pond and and the 2 huge buildings were amazing . One holds works of arts the other was a home but we could not get in as you have to make a appointment to see all inside or as a tour . The ground s are beautiful and peaceful away from the traffic of the city
73,4.0,It was interesting to see this traditional palace sitting among all the sky scrappers.  Hopefully you'll have a tour guide that can give you some of the history about the place.
74,3.0,Most of the Korean palaces are restored.  This does not take from giving you the view of how they would have appeared during the period as the Koreans have painstakingly reconstructed the buildings using the techniques and styles of the time.  But they do tend to all look the same once you have view more than two.  I would recommend you to visit one that appeals to you and spend some time viewing that one and they have the rest of your time in Seoul visiting other interesting places
75,5.0,"the palace was near the city hall, and this palace is smaller that the other. I loves this place because there is a east meet west buildings. the architecture and garden was amazing, i could to spend much time. recommend for waffle and coffee outside the entrance door. and you must visit the church and city hall too."
76,4.0,"Unfortunately, we were the last tourist to visit there, just 10 min before the entry closed. But even in evening time, the palace still looked beautiful. If I have chance to visit here again, I would like to come in the day time.Good for family or couple. the path from the entry gate to the palace square, is green and make you feel refreshed."
77,4.0,"A modest price gets you into this lovely Park and Palace complex, has some old displays and the National Museum of Contemporary Art (If you like contemporary art). Preferring the historical background of the Palace, there isn't a large collection of buildings but the Palace building is impressive. At intervals during the day, there is a changing of the guard ceremony at the main gate  opposite Seoul Plaza/City Hall. It lasts about 10 minutes and there is a lot of marching/drums beating and shrill horns blaring. Don't know the details as it all in Korean, but its certainly a colourful impressive ceremony. You can hang around afterwards at have your picture taken with the participants."
78,4.0,"famous for it's stone wall, some building still under renovation.mixed of korean and western style buildings."
79,5.0,"We were just in time to watch the changing of the guards ceremony. After the ceremony, there was a martial arts using sword display by 3 guards. Then we were allow to take photos with the guards in their colourful attires. It was an hour long event. Next we proceeded to visit the palace. As in the other palaces, there was  the entrance, then the gate to the throne hall and the open stoned courtyard with stone markers. Up in the ceiling above the thrione seat is a pair of  engraved dragons. Then it was to the other pavilions and buildings. There are many tall trees to give shade unlike in Gyeongbokgung. Palace and the palace ground is also not so large.. Right at the rear, you will see a nice fountain and the National Museum of Modern and contemporary art at the back. Entrance to the museum is free and it is worth a visit."
80,5.0,"The Palace itself is not that interesting, buildings that are empty of fixtures and fittings inside, not much to see, but the park is nice and there is a small cafe overlooking a lake.  The changing of the guard is great - such colourful costumes, music and deliberate ceremony, we loved it!!!  Over 65's get in for free and low cost for others.  Worth turning up for the ceremony which takes place at the entrance to the palace so no need to go inside."
81,4.0,"We stumbled upon the palace after seeing some other sites. Very cheap, very pretty and we even got to see a show of some sort, with people walking on ropes! Lots of fun! And the palace itself is nice, with beautiful grounds."
82,4.0,We came across this accidentally as we were walking from Namdaemun to city hall. Entrance fee was only 1$! My wife liked the handsome guard at the entrance :) (it's cool that you can take pictures together). Nowhere near as big as the main palace but beautiful and very well-maintained.
83,4.0,"Deoksugung Palace and gardens is a must-see in the middle of Seoul - just across from the City Hall & Seoul Plaza.The entrance is via the impressive Sumumjang gate, where a 'changing of the guard' ceremony is regularly held. Entrance is cheap - free if you are 65 or over and have a passport or driving license. They sell a handy little guide book which will fit in your pocket and costs just 500 Won.Over the years much restoration work has been needed, reflecting Korea's troubled past and rather inconvenient neighbours! But the various structures are well worth looking at and, on a fine day with the trees in blossom, it is a magical place to stroll round."
84,5.0,"Well, here is the main place in Seoul. I recommend for a couple or family. Here is much smaller than Gwanghwamun Gate near here. Especially, Seokjojeon Hall, I love this place."
85,4.0,"Most hotels' concierge will tell you there's nothing much to see here. But this palace is quiet, has a mix of architecture styles and is quite interesting. Do not miss the changing of guards ceremony and check with hotel the timings especially during winter (if too cold, apparently there is no ceremony). In the Seokjojeon hall, there's an interesting guided tour (foreigners follow the Korean group with audio guide) about King Gojong and his son, Sunjong, the last monarch of Korea. Sadly, the Korean tour moves very quickly from room to room, and those listening to audio guides are ushered out to another room before  it's finished. The audio guide is very informative."
86,2.0,"This late 16th century palace (and its numerous reconstructions) really fail to impress.The park itself is lovely, at best, with a nice pond and fountain in its middle, but the palace is anything but unique.The National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art lies within the park, but it was being renovated while we visited in August, so we could not visit it (of course, nobody bothers to tell you that when you buy the ticket to the park - apx. 1US$).Skip it."
87,5.0,"I love the coziness that Deoksugung palace gives you. It's in the heart of the city but still peaceful and enjoyable if you want to get away from the busy city life. It also has old western style buildings in the back of the palace, very unique! +The guard cermony is a daily thing so you just have to time it right(mothing spectacular for me)+ Cheap!+Depending on the season and time of the day this can be amazing! In April you can see beautiful cherry blossom!In summer you can experience some kind of festival. In winter if you are very lucky you can experience the palace covered in snow! (Rare)Go in the evening and you can experience more of its mystique when it's lit up! Also you have the city background that gives it a nice atmosphere.- If you go on the wrog day it is not that great."
88,4.0,"After you pay a small fee you can enter this huge park, during fall with nice yellow color of the leaves. You can spend hours in this park, but don't forget the watch the change of the guards. This park is opposite city hall. The Seoul city bus has a busstop here."
89,5.0,Beautiful grounds. Had a very enjoyable time walking through. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.
90,4.0,Managed to catch the show and was really glad we made it. It s something different and interesting. The signs stated it would start at 2pm but the ceremony only started 230pm.there were photo opportunities with the guards in costumes before and after the ceremony.
91,5.0,"You really need to visit this amazing palace when you are traveling in Seoul. It is one of the Five Royal Palaces in the city, all of which are located in the district of Jongno District and Jung District (so they are reasonably close on to the other) and you can get a cumulative ticket to visit them all.Do not miss it!"
92,5.0,We visited it around 8pm. Supposedly it closes at 9pm but you need to buy the ticket in advance because the ticket counter is closed after 6pm. We got a combined ticket for several palaces. The palace is beautiful at night. There weren't many people so it was a really nice visit.
93,5.0,"So peaceful and less busy than any of the other palaces we visited. Came with the combination ticket that you can purchase for 10,000KRW. Really easy to get to using the metro. Really Peaceful to sit and relax in if you have time while visiting. Some western buildings also in the corner of this palace however these were not open when we went. A must see!!"
94,3.0,"An opportunity to see how Western architecture sits with Eastern architecture. Unlike other contributors I felt it looked out of place but it summarises Korean History. A great change away from isolationist policy to the embracing of the West. The palace was used by the King after the annexation of Korea by Japan whilst Gyeongbokgung was renovated and rebuilt after it's destruction.Expansive grounds but yet again limited information. Nothing particularly special with the rooms devoid of furnishings.There are three guards standing outside the museum where many people have there photo taken.I do think it is a real shame that these palaces are not showcasing Korean history as what little I have found on this trip has been very interesting.If you are visiting the main 4 palaces and shrine then get the combined ticket for 10,000won. It also includes the 'secret garden' tour."
95,4.0,"Liked this palace ... smaller, more interesting layout and of course the impressive changing of the guard ceremony. It also lies aside the new modern Western residence that the last King built in the early 1900's which we were told will be open to the public probably October this year. What makes this palace so intersting is that mix of old and new. What was once the garage is now a cafe. This coffee habit started life in the Jeonggwanheon (Hall) where the King drunk his beloved brew ... but got poisoned! ... which supposedly stopped him producing any heirs! Great modern stories mixed in with the old history.  The changing of the guard ceremony a bit staged, and a tiny bit off putting when you can see the velcro and the odd Nike trainer on the soldiers. None the less a good spectacle and an even better photo opportunity"
96,5.0,"Following our visit to Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung, we had some time to visit Deoksugung. The history of this palace is covered extensively elsewhere, and all the practical information required is in the excellent KTO page http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=264316 We bought an Integrated Ticket of Palaces which covers Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung, Deoksugung, Gyeongbokgung and Jongmyo Shrine. This was excellent value at 10,000 won. After the history lessons at the first two much larger palaces, we did not join a tour as the palace is small enough to wander around independently, with notes from your guidebook. It is situated in delightful gardens, with many seats dotted around, so you can bring a picnic or rest your weary feet if you have been shopping too much in the nearby area. There is also a Changing of the Guards ceremony at this palace, and the National Museum of Contemporary Art is in the same compound. Although this palace is not as big as Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung, I gave it a five star rating because of its convenient location right in the centre of a shopping area, which means you can just pop in for a quick visit and get some history and culture, along with some art as well."
97,4.0,"Would highly recommend the changing of the guard ceremony in front of the entrance, particularly if you have kids! Guards and soldiers are dressed in full traditional costumes and regalia with traditional music playing the background. In the middle of the ceremony, the audience is invited to take pictures with the soldiers. I saw tourists in traditional costumes - I think there is a tent near the front providing costumes to add to the experience. The palace grounds are well presented (we had the extra bonus if cherry blossoms) with the palace buildings here and there along the grounds. We found an hour was sufficient to walk around."
98,5.0,"While changing guard ceremony is a must see (and free) at the palace gate, you can be part of it by registering at the tent in front of the gate. There are also many clothes to lent to visitors to have a taste of traditional costumes, men women kids. Looks like we are travelled back in time, contrasted with the surrounding skyscrappers. I was invited to be in full dress and hit the drum as part of the ceremony. A white guy looked at me, in full guard costume, with envy (or not). If you found it too cold to stand in the wind, there is a cafe in wall glass and chairs facing the gate."
99,4.0,"We visited this palace at night, which was very interesting to see all the buildings lit up. The grounds are not as extensive as the other palaces so if you can only choose one or two to visit I wouldn't pick this one but if you have time to see them all, this one is worth a visit. I think this palace is interesting because of it's proximity to so many modern buildings (history meets the city)."
100,3.0,Significantly smaller than the other 3 places in Seoul.  Only 1000 won to enter so not expensive.  It does not take long to see all the buildings.  We did find the changing of the guard at 11am to be quite impressive.
101,5.0,"Deoksgung is centrally located by Seoul City Hall in a large City Square. This is a great Palace to visit! They do a changing of the guard ceremony right out front with traditional costumes, a musical procession with a large booming drum and interesting traditional music sounds. It was fun to watch, I loved how it sounded, very haunting and timeless. Here you can also just spend some quality photo-taking time, by wandering the grounds, nice anytime of year! There is a vineyard-like archway, a fountain and lovely trees throughout the palace grounds to help frame your photos of the palace houses. It's a really nice piece of history smack dab in the middle of the shiny new Seoul skyscrapers.Tip: Great noodle shop across the street for lunch and sadly a big ol Dunkin Donut shop, too."
102,3.0,"This is the smallest of the palaces I visited. It was quite cheap but the one with the least amount of information, and least restored. There is a changing of the guards but it's not as elaborate as the other palaces as the space is smaller. But it is closer to City center than the rest. The museum inside is an additional fee."
103,3.0,"The smallest of the 4 Seoul palaces on the UNESCO heritage list. This buildings and surrounding park is nice for a walk. But, nothing terribly exciting about it, although I enjoyed being there and seeing the architecture."
104,5.0,"I  enjoyed this Palace, lots of history. I arrived by subway(line 1 to City Hall), the station stop was right at the entrance to the Palace.  Entrance fee was only KRW3000, which was well worth it!! there is so much to explore. Be sure to check out the Changing of the Guard Ceremony, which they do several times a day, not to be missed!! there is also a very interesting Museum and a gift shop which offers some very colorful gifts.  After visiting Deoksugung, check out Namdaemun Market, which is a short walk away, you will find anything here, also a great place to grab a bite to eat!"
105,5.0,"We really enjoyed this Palace.  We arrived early by subway at stop City Hall (line 1). this puts you right at the entrance to the Palace. By arriving early, we avoided the crowds & were able to get some good photos of the grounds & Palace. By luck, there was also a reenactment parade with all the people dressed in traditional costumes from the workers right up to the king/emperor. Entrance fee is only KRW3000 & it's a really peaceful place. Just remember, it's closed on Monday's like most things in Seoul regarding tourist orientated business. ."
106,5.0,"One of Korea's grand palaces and located near the City Hall. The changing of the guards is one of the attraction, at 11h. & 14h. The big drum sound brings in the courtyard the guards in colorful period costumes performing the daily ceremony accompanied by martial drums. You have the opportunity to listen to the explanation in English. It helps to understand. The entry fee for this palace is 3000 won and you need time if you want to understand what was going on in that century and please yourself with photos opportunities. The palaces, the large pound, the water clock shaped like a bell, ancient artillery pieces, the museum... and the surrounding is large, you will need time. It can also be hot, an umbrella could be useful. We enjoyed it! We love history.."
107,3.0,"we happened to walk past this palace as the changing of the guard was happening. they certainly turn it into a highlight of the palace, with narration in a couple of languages. the grounds are relaxing and there is a nice contrast between the low old buildings resting below the higher modern buildings. the entrance fee is only W1,000 per person."
108,3.0,"This is probably the most accessible palace in its proximity to Seoul city hall, but the alterations to it during the long Japanese occupation gives you the impression that this, of the three major palaces within Seoul, is the most affected.  A multiple palace entry ticket is good value, though palace entry is generally quite cheap, and this palace is included.  There is probably little point in visiting this palace too if you are seeing the major palaces to the north."
109,4.0,"Be aware of time if you want to see changing of the guard with traditional soldiers which can be organized at around 3.00PM. Beside historical building, some modern buildings inside makes this place very interesting mix of western and Korean style.My trip was in the end of October, when the almond trees surround the palace banks dyed yellow fall colors, I admired the most beautiful time of the palace. At this time, the streets Doldamgil the area around the palace as well Jeongdong church is worth a visit. The entrance fee is so cheap, just US$1."
110,4.0,"This is a smallest palace I think, but does have nicest changing of guards as you can get really up close and personal. Also, there are some interesting little tidbits within the palace not seen other places. It has an art museum, but I would mostly go for a nice walk and the guards ceremony."
111,4.0,This was our first stop in Seoul as we timed it perfectly to see the 3pm changing of the guard with traditional soldiers.  It's also right across from the City Hall which at the time had a massive riot police reinforced demonstration Korean style.  So you may get to see 1000 riot police while watching this 15 min ceremony.Great first sight visit for us and the palace inside is very quaint.  Had some western buildings inside which makes this place very interesting mix of western and Korean style.  Only costs 1000won to get in and if you are in this area definitely worth seeing.But ideally you time this with the changing of the guard ceremony (although you will see this at the other main palace as well).Walking distance to the outdoor Namdaemung market and South Gate so ideally you combine this with those visits.
112,4.0,"Deoksugung Palace is the very first stop on the Seoul City Bus loop, so it accidentally became the first palace we visited. Though it may not be as extravagant or elaborate as Gyeongbokgung or Changdeokgung, it is still worth visiting if you have the time for it. Make note of the times for the ""changing of the guard"" ceremonies. We just happened to be there at the right time to see the 11am performance.The entrance fee is a mere 1,000 KRW—a complete steal in my opinion. If you're not sure how much time you'll have to visit all of the palaces in Seoul, just pay separately. The 10,000 KRW all-inclusive ticket booklet only saves you 1,000 KRW if you end up going to everything (includes Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace with Secret Garden, Changgyeonggung Palace, and Jongmyo Shrine). Granted, we did buy the booklet and it kind of forced us to visit everything, which isn't a bad thing."
113,5.0,"having worked in the busy city of seoul, deoksugung quickly became our favourite place to escape to whenever we could as a beautiful, peaceful retreat. without a doubt this is my favourite place in seoul. the grounds are often way quieter than the other palaces, and there are beautiful little nooks and crannies to picnic at everywhere. there are lovely buildings to explore and amazing tales to learn here. be sure to plan on staying for a few hours here and just soak in the beauty. great history, but even more amazing perhaps, great refuge in this hectic city!"
114,5.0,"Located across the street from City Hall this 'palace' was easy to find.  There is an entry fee (1,000 WON or US$ 1.00) to visit the 'palace' we were here to witness the Changing of the Guard Ceremony.Held daily (except Monday) at 11:00, 14:00 and 15:30 the ceremony lasts about 20 minutes.  Fantastic colourful costumes and narrated in both Korean and English.  The was a very strong wind when we were there and that may have been responsible for the small crowd.  It was an advantage for us as there was no contest for a spot to photograph the event.One of the best free shows we've seen."
