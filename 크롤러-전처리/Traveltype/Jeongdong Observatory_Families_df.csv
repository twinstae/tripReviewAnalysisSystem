0,5.0,"This was worth a visit.  In the lobby of the building it might look like only government officials are allowed to go up the elevators, but don't let this dissuade you.  We were able to go up and take in great views of Deoksugung Palace and the city while enjoying hot tea.  Something I never saw in the restroom before:  a shelf had about a dozen mugs each with a toothbrush inside.  I assume this was for employees. I thought that was pretty cool."
1,4.0,"This is the observatory next to Deoksugung Palace. Not that many people know this place. It's great to look down the palace and Jongro District.How to get:It's on the 13th floor of City Hall Annex. After 3~5 min of the road on the left of Daehanmun(the main gate of Deoksugung), it's on the left. On weekend, the front door is closed. But, there's an extra door on the right side of the building.- There are about 20 chairs toward windows. And we didn't need to wait to occupy seats.- There's a little cafe together. Coffees are nice, a lot in cups and affordable. Order at coffee shop isn't essential to stay. No one is watching visitors. So, people just stayed comfortably talking one another.- Deoksugung Palace is viewable at a glance. Northern mountains like Inwangsan and Bukaksan are partially visible because of high towers.- At the end of the observatory, there's the picture gallery of past Seoul."
2,5.0,"The observatory is open from 9 AM - 9 PM on weekdays, and 9 AM - 6 PM on weekends. We went out of Exit 1 of the Seoul City Hall Station, Line 1. With Deoksugung Palace on your right, follow the path on the left until you find the Seosomun Building. The front entrance was closed when we got there after office hours, so we entered the building through a side entrance (just follow the path around the corner of the building). There was a turnstile left open for those who want to go to the observatory, which is on the 13th floor. There is a cafe available there where you can buy cookies and drinks.Great views of Deoksugung Palace, the mountains, and even of the City Hall (to the right)!"
3,5.0,"A good place to rest your feet after ambling about at Deoksugung Palace.  Entry to the observatory is free, and you can unwind with a cup of coffee by the window, watching the world go by, and soaking in the great view of the city."
4,4.0,"Marvellous viewpoint overlooking the palace. Despite being free, not packed, although difficult to find (walk along the wall until you see the government building; door is on the right hand side of the building). Little signage in English so follow the locals. Well worth a visit (remember to also look at the old photos on the walls)."
