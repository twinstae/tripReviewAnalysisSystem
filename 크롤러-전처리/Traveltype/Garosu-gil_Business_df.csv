1,3.0,"It very good to feel the gangnam style. It was very good when I first visit here at that time I didn't feel any inconvenience but today (9 June, 2017) I am waiting for customers. There is no ""Open Restrooms"" in this street. (In South Korea, we have many oppen restroom for visitors.) So I have buy drinks or coffee to go to restroom or I have to far to subway station.  It is very uncommen in South Korea that don't have  open restroom in the shooping street or tour destinations.  :-("

Had one of the best bagels in the Line Cafe to my surprise. Quaint restaurants as well, and the people there are pretty trendy. Worth a morning or afternoon visit to any of the cafes there."
