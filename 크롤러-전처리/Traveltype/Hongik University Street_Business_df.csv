8,3.0,Its a buzzing street with Uni students and shops. We wanted to go to eat something before we head to a pub. I am not a pork or a beef eater so I struggled to find a decent restaurant. most of the pubs do not have much food options. Most of the pubs had menus in Korean only so ordering was a problem. The streets were crowded till two am.

And despite the crowd felt completely safe there on my own."

I was a lucky one to have seen Running Member Haha at one corner selling hotdogs (??) for a vendor with a camera crew."
23,5.0,"Lots of shopping, food, etc.  Aa design cafe is one of my favorite places and it is about a km from the subway station.  Area is definitely more for young college students but anyone can join in on the fun.  For the budget conscience there are, as I understand it, lots of good hostel type lodging options here.  And, it may sound silly but, I like going to the Taco Bell here! :)   Japanese curry houses abound and I recommend them.  Or go to a place where you cook thick bacon teppanyaki or bbq tableside style.  Lots of cute shops especially for those who like designy things."

26,5.0,"Just outside the metro station (Hongik University Station) Exit 9. The area is quite huge with many little shops. Most shops open after 11am. Best to come during the afternoon. The highlight is the weekend Free Market next to the park. This market gives the place its unique character, the products sold are quite different from what you will get from other shopping areas in Seoul.As this is near a university there is a lot of lively activities and it is good to just walk around."
27,5.0,"Hongdae has markets on both Saturday and Sunday, great for those hunting for one of a kind souvenirs.  There's a Hello Kitty Cafe for those traveling with children...or Kitty fans like me. There's a NANTA theatre near this area for some non-verbal comedy fun for the whole family.  Shopping is plentiful, and there are tons of restaurants and bars to choose from (the most popular cuisines were chicken wings and pork knuckles).  The area really comes alive towards the evening so I'd recommend coming for the market, shop/hang out at the cafes, attend the NANTA show and then stay for dinner and late night entertainment.  College towns are so much fun!"
28,4.0,"It's full of ""student atmosphere"" in this area, which may make you feel young!  There are lots of shops selling low price items, I think young people must like it!"
29,4.0,"From HongDae Ipgoo metro station to HongIk University, there are so many intersting shops, souvenirs, costum, dresses, jewellery and a variety of restaurants with unique interior. Near HongIk University, there are many street shops with homemade items and low price fashion items. At night more people on the streets. Some furniture shops also have some facinating items with creative design. The only bad point is traffic jam, expecially Friday nights."
