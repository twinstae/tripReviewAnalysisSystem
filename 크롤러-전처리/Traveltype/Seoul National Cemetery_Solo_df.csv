0,5.0,It is a cemetery indeed but it is so well done that it shows a tremendous amount of respect to the diseased. Beautiful autumn trees and very calm and relaxing atmosphere. I would def recommend to visit and pay respect.
1,5.0,Huge cemetery and war memorial in a busy part of Seoul buffered by woodland on most sides that allow for a beautiful and sobering walk. War relics and interpretative materials are available in buildings scattered about the acreage while there are many small monuments and notable tombs/graves. I was most impressed with the staff - many sought me out to provide English materials or just tried to make the experience richer in some way - a quiet and profound experience to take in over an hour or more.

3,4.0,"I have lived in Korea for 12 years (almost 11 in Seoul) but had never been here before. Koreans don't consider cemeteries as a place to sightsee and I've never suggested to my non-Korean friends to check this place out. I had some free time yesterday and wanted to go to a new place I hadn't been. I was surprised at how quiet it was. There are older people that just go there for a walk. It's laid out beautifully with grave markers everywhere to commemorate soldiers from the Korean War. I especially loved going to the top and looking below. The sight is astounding and you don't feel like you're in the middle of a large metropolitan area.There is no entrance fee. You can go to the visitor's center if you like to check out books or get pamphlets to tell you who is buried there or just go right in and stroll around by yourself.Don't forget to check out the clock on the grass which is at the entrance (at the rotary). I didn't realize it was a real clock!Finally, another reviewer said that the Seoul National Cemetery is near Exit 6. I'm not sure if the exit number changed but as of February 23, 2016 it is near EXIT 8."
4,4.0,The National Cemetery has a hauntingly beautiful air to it that instantly makes you feel more humbled and calm.A great place for a stroll especially during spring and autumn when the park foliage have much more color to them.
