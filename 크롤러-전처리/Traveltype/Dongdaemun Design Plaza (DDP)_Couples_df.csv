0,3.0,DDP LED Rose Garden is closed when we get there. :( So frustrated not to find it while thinking that it should be where it should be. Didn't get any review or advise online that it will be closed so sharing this post which hopefully would help those who plan to go to DDP to see
1,3.0,Will not visit again.  Interesting building design from the outside but boring on the inside. Noting much to do inside. 
2,5.0,"Excellent gallery, beautiful building, world-class art. We went during winter and it was great to have some time away from the cold."
3,4.0,"Located in the heart of Seoul, this Plaza certainly stands out for its futuristic design! There's a small museum nearby that goes into great detail about the flood control measures that have been implemented. Some ruins have been preserved as well. "
4,5.0,"Also caled DDP. This space ship is a major urban and most iconic landmark in Seoul. Build by Zaha Hadid Architects this neo-futuristic eccentric compkex is a multipurpose cultural center with galleries, event spaces, design shops and lawns that rise up to its roof. Here is the"
5,3.0,"This building symbolises modem South Korea with its futuristic design. The building  is lighted up in the night. Inside is a  kind of shopping mall with shops, restaurants and halls for exhibitions and cultural programs."
6,5.0,"This area is one of the best place to shop but this time, we went here to enjoy the cold weather and take lots of pictures here! Truly a wonderful place for photography"
7,4.0,Went here with my fiance and its amazing. The structure of the building is impressive. The way they left a piece of history in the middle is great and I love the 2 statues as well. If you get hungry there are a few different places to eat. Definitely going to go back next year.
8,4.0,Very nice to go even on a rainyday. Seoul showing off their modern arquitecture you can take nice pictures and visit Kako friends shop without the crowd.
9,5.0,"This is such a great area to visit! Great architecture and lots to do here! Shopping, outdoor markets, food, buildings! Their buildings are absolutely amazing!"
10,5.0,"We admire ZH jewels, this is one with rounded forms. Could spend hours there.Actual exhibition Paul Smith fashion designer."
11,3.0,"The building itself is wonderful but full of wasted space. You walk around expecting something great but it never comes. The shops around the area are a waste of time, selling knock-offs and cheap local style ""aji-ma"" style clothing."
12,5.0,Amazing architecture - the work of Zaha Hadid. Interestingly arranged interiors - from the design galery to the shopping center. Worth a visit.
13,5.0,"Here you can easily spend lot of time, impressive place also from outside and inside. Loved ""furniture exhibition"" where you see and can try design chairs all over from the world."
14,4.0,"Dongdaemun Design Plaza’s curvy and wave structure catches my eye in a neighbourhood of straight, boxy office buildings. Without the signages you would not know where is the entrance to the building.We walked around the DPP on a late afternoon to appreciate its exterior. Each different angle gives you a fresh perspective of the building. We didn’t visit any of the indoor exhibitions. There are shops, cafe and restaurants in the basement, and street artists who could do a quick portrait for you.The DDP is directly connected to a subway station. I’ll recommend a visit in the early evening."
15,4.0,One can't miss this delightful building when in the area -- but the delightful exterior far exceeds the utilitarian interior.
16,4.0,Dongdaemun  Design Plaza’s architecture is amazing..great sight with several shopping centers nearby.
17,5.0,The building designed by the wellknown late Zaha Hadid looks like a scifi spaceship landed in the middle of the city aurrounded by shopping malls. It looks amazing and walking in it feels like inside something surreal. Every corner is curved giving the feeling of endless boundary without borders. Really very interesting design concept and realization.
18,2.0,"We aren't only to find out there were no exhibits. Literally zero things to look at inside. It's a nice enough building, but we were expecting to see actual design work inside, only to discover they were between exhibits, have no permanent collections, and most people went for the market out front and the children's playland on the top floor. It was very disappointing. Would highly recommend finding out if there's actually something to look at before you go, else just stop by if it's on your way to someplace else. Not worth it to go to Dongdaemun just to look at an empty building."
19,4.0,We went in the evening. There was a food and art fair when we were there. A live musical performance as well. Food trucks were available and the local youth were spending their evening enjoying the good food and music.
20,4.0,"Besides the great amazing architecture, the thousands of LED rose flowers art exhibition also one of the most romance attraction at Design Plaza, it will close on 30-04-19, don't miss it at night time together with you lover, so romantic for photo taking."
21,5.0,This is the worlds  largest 3D atypical structure. The architecture is amazing. It has beautiful graceful curves. The whole structure is column free. At night time it is lit up and is really pretty.
22,5.0,"If you’re into modern infrastructure, engineering, construction, or art muesuem, you must visit Dongdaemun Design Plaza. This place is perfect for couples or families of all ages. This destination is a futuristic multi-use facility that serves as a museum, shopping center, café, holds public community events, and is connected to the train system. It’s best to visit at night so you could view the beautiful artificial flowers that light-up. The vibe here is very relaxing as people could be found everywhere socializing and being present in the moment."
23,5.0,Wonderful park to spend an afternoon.  Lots of things to see and close to the famous fashion center.  Connected by metro and located near many restaurants.
24,5.0,Use Exit 10 to check out the front of DDP illuminated at night.Then walk a long its corridors and admire the changing lights of the structure.
25,5.0,"Very nice place, took a picture of it and check in to Facebook! Alot of people as well so it's nice.Other than that, nothing much"
26,5.0,"The architectural design is very unique by following the contour of the surroundings. The thousand led flower lighting was mesmerising in the evening and is great for photography!In addition to near metro station, there are nice shops and restaurants there as well."
27,5.0,"I find the night view of this beautiful and serene amongst the hustle and bustle of the city. It's a modern walk thru the garden where you will find lit roses and standalone pianos to be played by any passers by (which can be heard from most parts of the spot). In the day you can do more with the design labs, art halls and others alike."
28,3.0,Mnet Music Awards 2018 was done here! There are free entrance in some areas for exhibits and garden. It is located near shopping malls and very convenient to go to because of nearby train station.
29,4.0,"I visited DDP at night. Beautiful building and lights. If you're here, be sure not to miss the LED rose garden."
30,5.0,"So glad I got to see this building. Also Love the shop inside. If you are an architect, this is a must place to visit in Seoul."
31,4.0,To be able to conceive such a beautiful building and making it a reality is awesome. Must visit the LED Rose garden at Noght
32,5.0,"you must try this branch of Aori japanese ramen.  the soup broth is so thick and yummy.  the sliced pork doesn’t smell and it was so soft, it melted in my mouth. the noodle was not soft or over cooked and it still had a good bite to it.  i ate here in 2 consecutive days. you have to ask for their english menu"
33,5.0,"It's a must see, appreciate the design of the building and come at night so you can see the different lighting fixtures. Also don't forget to see the LED rose garden."
34,5.0,"Unfortunately we missed this as it doesnt open until 10.00 which is when we had to leave we were only in Soeul for 23 hours so did the night market and missed this as our hotel hadnt mentioned it. was so near The building is stunning shame we didnt get the full experience, check the opening timings if your going as it changes weedays/weekends"
35,5.0,"We visited just after sunset, around dusk. The lights came on shortly after we arrived. Fantastic building, it's great to be able to wander around & view it from all angles. Really beautiful, so glad we visited."
36,5.0,"Visited this iconic architectural site on 26 October 2018 about 5 PM, it’s the perfect time to take pictures only a couple hours before sunset, we still have natural light, shadow was softer, the angles and length more vibrant. The view was breath-taking."
37,3.0,"Only visited during the day. Some people say here that it looks great at night. Im sure it would. They pulled down a huge baseball complex to build this amazing shell of a building on this site. Its great looking on the outside, but its the opposite of the Tardis. Big on the outside, virtually nothing on the inside. A couple of unattended sad sort of museums ( with boxes etc just lying around) , a small shopping centre and a train station entry. Must have cost a bomb. Nice curvy lines yes, practical/ useful - not at all. Underutilised. An opportunity lost ( a concert hall it should have been or just a modern stadium etc ) and I love modern architecture, but only if it is functional."
38,3.0,"We went to see this at the end of our trip; the design museum was closed (not sure why.) There’s a nice gift shop inside with handcrafted items by Korean artists which are reasonable and better quality (bought some earrings.). Ended up at a shopping area (Lotte) across the street which was standard fare (most of the clothing had no prices on them, a little odd.)"
39,3.0,"We visited the place at night to look at the Led garden, It was beautiful. It is quite easy to find the Led garden. It was quite impressive."
40,5.0,"This Zaha Hadid-designed building is absolutely stunning, both inside and out and is a must see if you are interested in architecture. Photos don’t do it justice as it is such a vast space from up close. Inside there is a large exhibition space featuring young designers which is great for browsing for gifts. Outside it is a short walk through the park to the shopping area of Dongdaemun."
41,5.0,Visited the DDP at night and it was so beautiful. The architectural beauty of Zaha Hadid's  design is accentuated at night with lights to wonderful effect. Didn't enter the building rather enjoyed the building and sculptures from outside. Definitely worth a look.
42,4.0,We were lucky that this beautiful piece of architecture was located almost next to our hotel. This place is really amazing. Walked around for one hour and took pictures from every direction. The forms are just amazing. It also stores a museum and some shops. Opposite the famous shopping buildings Lotte and APM wholesale.
43,3.0,"I think most people come here to see the unique architecture. But if you like art, go inside. Many shops there sell novelties and artsy things"
44,4.0,"This building is definitely one-of-a-kind in Seoul with its neo-futuristic design and massive perimeter (kind of looks like a UFO, IMO). Best visited at night when all of its lights are switched on. Tip: For foodies like myself, there is an awesome food court at Doota Mall (opposite DDP), Basement 1. Worth a visit!"
45,5.0,"a new place to hangout, and very stylish even at night. People are very relaxed and there's night markets every Friday and Saturday. Though not many foods for selection, you won't regret visiting."
46,3.0,"If I say this the same as mangga dua jakarta indonesia. Goods there tend to be expensive. If not join the tour then this place can be missed. But if you join a tour then try touring around the building, you will find Korean street food"
47,4.0,Very impressive architecture.  Saw the led roses lit up at night.  Beautiful.  There were stalls selling handmade accessories and essential oils.  There were also carts selling food and drinks at night.  Prices are quite high tho.
48,4.0,"There are so many amazing buildings in Seoul to see, mostly historical palaces, but there's something new and very impressive to see, Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) it is rather futuristic. The DDP is divided into a Design Hall, Art Hall, and Museum Hall, the whole complex is free to the public to visit, we walked through one of the buildings, but got more joy out of walking around outside. The complex was built on the former sight of Dongdaemun Stadium, built by the Japanese in the 1920s during the Japanese occupation.  During the process of redevelopment of the sight, relics were found which are now displayed on a large surface under the canopy of the curved roofline.  There are many other interesting things to see, do and eat in the area, it's a great part of Seoul to explore."
49,5.0,"What a fantastic idea. So much creativity to see and on the day we went, there was an African food market. Typical Seoul to always be thought provoking and creative. Great coffee shop inside if you need to shelter from the heat (or cold) too."
50,4.0,"Besides the beautiful architecture of the DDP (we have not visited the galleries), the highlight is the LED rose garden which looked so beautiful at night! A must visit when in Seoul!"
51,2.0,"The design of the complex is great, but that is all about it. Many empty stores and spaces. Better to be seen than visited."
52,5.0,"No doubt DDP is one of the most interesting sites to see in Seoul. Designed by famed Iranian architect Zaha Hadid, DDP is a fascinating contradiction to the squarish city that is Seoul. To really appreciate the marvel, visitors need to spend at least half a day walking and discover all its nooks and crannies."
53,5.0,"As great it is to walk around, you should really go in and check their design stores with some tasty coffee"
54,5.0,"Wow. This place amazing and beautiful. It's also the venue conferences, fashion shows, trade shows,.... The museum hall is a harmonious blend of Korean design and globalization. I will be back here when I come back Korea."
55,5.0,"Easily accessible by Dongdaemun History and Culture Metro station. Big and beautiful building, rather unique and artistic design. A great place to walk and take a stroll at in the evening if you are coming to Dongdaemun, lots of shopping and eateries opposite it."
56,5.0,"This place is a must to see, The architectuur can you campare with the modern part of Valencia, or the Gugenheim building in Bilbao.In the building you will be surprises buy the rolling lines of the wall’s."
57,4.0,"It is a nice building, surrounded by malls and restaurants. Good for photo taking but the place itself has nothing much. Perhaps spend an hour or less there, take some photos and move to the shopping malls nearby or find a nice cafe to relax. There is a tour bus station (hop-on, hop-off) nearby, and a metro station right beside."
58,5.0,"At first glance, the DDP looks like a set from a sci-fi movie (more like a giant space ship).  The building has a very modern and futuristic design so it makes a very nice background for photos. Don't forget to go to the back for the LED roses which light up at night.  There are not too many shops inside the building, though. But there are a lot of stores surrounding the DDP where you can do your shopping.  Worth the visit."
59,5.0,"Only stopped here because the building looked so cool from outside (my husband and I were on a bus tour). Didn't go inside, but walking around the building is cool enough; cool vibe and great people, lots of food stands around and great architecture, would highly recommend."
60,4.0,"This area is bustling and so lively at night. It is more of a wholesale market where people from all around the globe sell their stuff. The place has a array of shopping malls from luxury brands to locals ones selling souveniers. This is the place to buy local souveniers which are cute and cheap. I have attached the Business card of two such sellers from whom we bought cute Koreans nail clippers, magnets, ceramic items, mirrors and so on. There is also a Zara outlet in one of the mall which sells clothes at very good prices. If you are lucky you can find amazing clothes from Massimo Dutti at never imaginable prices at the same Zara outlet. DDP is a must visit."
61,3.0,Impressive place in terms of design but lacks an information counter or signages in English. Good to walk around if you have no agenda.
62,5.0,"The Dongdaemun Design Plaza was amazing, i came here in the night and the lights make it more magical to see. Since the mall around here they open 24 hours so this area will be packed by tourist and local who shop."
63,4.0,Showcases modern architecture of curves and modern materials. There are art shops inside that features unique designs. There is a pay museum at upper level. You can also relax at garden/open areass around the building. Right across the streets are several shopping malls some at duty free prices.
64,4.0,Looks wonderful on the outside! Good for pics. The shape is artsy and interesting. We didn't do much inside other than wander around.
65,4.0,Just the building and the surrounding area alone are worth a visit. There weren't many exhibitions going on when we were there though so the design shop was actually the most interesting thing inside with so much cute anime or kpop inspired things or design pieces.
66,5.0,This huge  unusual building has no corners or straight walls. Walk around it and enjoy the interesting surface of the building. You will also pass the old city wall. If you are smart you take an elevator of a the highest highrise building next to the DDP. Once you have reacherd the top floor cross the roof by foot and from the staircase of the connecting building you have a perfect view on DDP and the old City wall.
67,5.0,"We came to see the rose led installation but since it wasn't dark yet, they weren't lit.  The building is pretty cool architecturally and we enjoyed walking around the complex.  There was a lot of walking space free from vehicular traffic.  Also, we walked inside a couple of the buildings.  Entrance is free."
68,5.0,"If you love beautifully designed contemporary buildings, then it's worth checking out DDP. We visited while there was a fashion show and there was a lot going on, but there's also some shops and some art museums and stuff. I believe there's kpop groups performing here from time to time, as part of 1thek's Run To You project, so you might even be lucky to catch a performance!"
69,5.0,"Located next to the Dongdaemun History and Culture Park subway station, DDP looks amazing in its design. I wasn't into architecture as much but it was a great to see something this unique. In addition to the exterior, there were exhibitions inside that showcase some intriguing and quirky everyday products from local designers that can be bought. DDP is surrounded by multiple shops in the Dongdaemun area so it can be a little side trip from shopping."
70,5.0,"This is an astounding building, inside and out, totally dedicated to cutting edge design in its many forms. Different studios, office space, conference areas, some shops and ..... We went on Monday. Most of the shops are closed then. But we loved seeing the building from the inside and exploring the area around it. If contemporary design does not interest you, just drive by!"
71,5.0,"This is a great piece of art by a world famous architect who had left us with many of her designs in other parts of the world. Also the Seoul government committed a big piece of land in the city for such project. (clap, clap, clap)Inside the building is many shops for design items that I have not all visited. Will plan to go again the next day."
72,5.0,"World famous architect designed building. A wonderful costume display when we visited, interesting retail outlets.reasonably priced clothes amongst the boutique shops."
73,2.0,"The building and the history points on site are nice but otherwise it's just shops on the inside.My girlfriend said it was one of the top ten things to see in Seoul, but I reckon you could safely miss this one."
74,4.0,"As a fashion shopping area for young people, I would recommend it as a place for tourists. that there is no design for older women. if there is in the sightseeing and trendy designs everyday."
75,5.0,The building here so artsy and futuristic. Be prepared to amazed since its not something u always get to see and there are also garden of led roses that shines in night. Best to visit day and night
76,4.0,"Awe Inspiring architecture, lots of exhibitions. design and concept stores. Great picture opportunity."
77,2.0,"This is an attention grabbing building with little utility.  There is little going on inside... Some shops selling modern design wares, venders, cafe.. Nothing substantial.   The Dongdarmun Market bldgs are still there with its shops crammed with products."
78,3.0,"The Dongdaemun design plaza is a beautiful structure. You can find here a few big fashion musea with a few big event halls, although I never had the luck to visit anyone of them. Everytime I visit the place (about every couple of months) there are no events.The design plaza is a good place to relax in a quiet place, away from the buzz outside in the many fashion shopping malls right beside."
79,5.0,"What started as an attempt to see the flowery lights that we only see in kdrama's . I was surprised to find that on the Saturday night that there will be loads of food trucks lines up in the vicinity of the DDP. Boy the choices was good... looking the portion of some of the order it was also quite filling and not to forget smells soo delicious. We just had dinner , therefor was too full .. But we did share a churros , which was awesome!! Crunchy on the outside with a soft chew fluffy insides .  Besides foodtrucks, there were selfmade artist selling their arts and also a blowup balloon arts that was everywhere .. a very good night out and loads of photo Opp's.!! Do checkout this is on the weekend. The night life from cheonggyecheon river to the malls opposite the DDP seems like its always busy with something during Saturday late evening to night... =)TIPS: for those who doesnt have much time to spare in korea.. these places are all within walking distance to checkout - Cheonggyecheon River end- Grill Fish street - Dongdaemun Shopping Malls -Multiple BIngsu places -multiple Train stations nearby - if you come in the morning even have a historical landmark too""forgotten the name"". sorry... but the DDP is quite central easy to make it a landmark ""In-Case-Of-Lost"" among a big group.. =). ENjoy!!"
80,4.0,"Dongdaemun is a pretty interesting place, with its countless street markets and architectural design, but it's nothing really more than a few photo ops, here or there. I do visit Dongdaemun frequently, to clear the head after a heavy night out, but there really isn't anything you would write home about. If you are into photography, it is a fantastic place to practice your depth of fields and length snapping, but it's nothing compared to the palaces you have on offer a mear 3 or 4 stops away in Jonggak or City hall. I suggest visiting only if you have bags of time and you are passing Dongdaemun on the subway."
81,4.0,"I enjoyed walking the halls of the Design Plaza, but I was expecting more art and less commercial space. The exhibit space was nearly empty and very few staff were working in these areas. Most visitors were in the mall or restaurant area. Very cool building and a great place to spend a few hours. This place has huge potential and is a great addition to city culture."
82,4.0,"You would have a hard time finding a more splendid building.  From the grassy roof to the curves that you want to touch, this is a one of a kind place.  Walk about the grounds and just take it in.  After that, well...there is not much.  A art shop area was actually sort of a cheesy mall.  A coffee space, while amazing with a huge interior barista area, was largely empty of people and soul.  Other spaces just were not used, leading to the question: what is this building for?  Pretty, but then what?"
83,5.0,Come after dinner to see the lights and appreciate the architecture of the Design Plaza before heading to shopd which open all night. Accessible by a couple of metro stops
84,4.0,"Great piece of architecture and design, if your lucky there may be an interesting exhibition on as well (we got lucky with '30 years of pixar'), design shop is cool too. Def one to see if you are a fan of architecture"
85,5.0,"Seoul is city of design.  One of the most unusual design is Dongdaemun Design Plaza.  I love it, inside and outside!"
86,4.0,"There are museum/ Exhibition center/ in the building, you should check schedule before visiting! After I had shopping near around It's very convenient to take subway there! I love Seoul!!!! :)"
87,4.0,"When I first see DDP, I think it may be a science park or something extraordinary inside, I think this DDP is invest by the Seoul goverment to showcase the products that create and design by Korean talents, well worth a visit if you have spare time.."
88,4.0,This is my second visit here.  This time not on purpose as I went to see the night market but at night the Design Plaza looks very cool!  Probably best in the day if you want to have a bite to eat but at night visit it with other things in the area!
89,3.0,"The DDP facility is neat to see but when we visited in June 2017 there wasn't much to do there inside. The design museum was featuring a Korean calligraphy exhibition entirely in Korean so that was kind of a loss for us. It is worth walking around the grounds for 20 minutes perhaps but in my opinion there wasn't anything to do in the facility itself. Plenty of big-box stores in the blocks immediately around the DDP. Yes, it's on the cover of the Lonely Planet Seoul guidebook, but I don't think it's sufficiently emblematic of Seoul or Korean culture to make it a must-see."
90,4.0,"Located in the Dongdaemun shopping district, you couldn't help but be awestruck by the jaw-dropping architecture of DDP. The gargantuan size of the building is simply too hard to miss as it totally dominates the Dongdaemun area. It is even visible from the Seoul city wall nearby. I must say that together with the 555m Lotte World Tower skyscraper, these are truly Seoul's modern iconic wonders!"
91,5.0,"An amazing building to see and walk through and around, it is huge, curved and has a sci-fi look (we are sure there will be Sci-Fi movie made there one day).  Just outside Dongdaemun station on Line 2, when you walk out of the station   you encounter your first sight of this amazing building.  There is a cafe at one end of the building worth visiting and shops in other parts as well as a museum and large outdoor sets (huge camera) and old piano that you can play in the walkways. If you have the time, worth a visit and a possible look into the future."
92,5.0,You cannot help being mesmerised by this stunning structure which dominates the area. You can marvel at the lines and its shear size. Make time to see this spectacle from the mind of the infamous Zaha Hadid. Can easily combine with a visit to Gwangjang market and a walk along the city stream.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
93,5.0,Spectacular designed building celebrates small new designs inside. Travel up to 26th floor of the shopping plaza opposite to get a good view. See the precinct at night to see the LED white 'roses' at night and visit the museum at the back to see the history of the site.
94,4.0,"Impressive and unusual architecture which needs to be viewed by walking around and in it. Unfortunately we were unable to see the design exhibits due to lack of time, but just walking around the building as it snakes around a vast are of land was an experience by itself. Be sure to research where exactly you want to go as it truly is sprawling and information even from the staff may fall somewhat short of what you will need."
95,4.0,Modern architecture building with great landscape. Outside is better than inside as the shops inside are a little disappointing. Went to see the night LED roses landscape and totally worth it for the photo.
96,5.0,The place is vast and multi functional.The architecture is stunning but discrete at the same time. During Seoul fashion week it become the main spot
97,3.0,We found the area to be interesting and enjoyed the historical museum and the old wall. The actual exhibits in the building weren't of a much interest to us. The staircase in the main building is amazing
98,3.0,"My opinion is that such buildings like this DDP (as well as other buidlings by Zaha Hadid architecture) need more space outside. You need to have a better vision of the general buidling to get more impression (take Baku, Azerbaijan for example). But here the buiding is stucked between other surrounding objects and you can't get the right feeling. Anyway, if you have never seen Zaha Hadid architecture - it is worth a visit surely. At the same time I must mentioned really interesting designer shop here (if I am not wrong it is called Designer Lab)."
99,5.0,"Just seeing the building is impressive in itself. The shops inside are pretty generic, but just going to check out the architecture is worth it. What a great piece of art."
100,4.0,"Really glad I went to check out the famed architecture.  It really is quite stunning.  The Design Lab is also good.  Expect high end prices on quirky goods.  Lots of international representation, so dont expect everything to be Made in Korea, although there are enough local designers to make this a worthwhile destination for souvenir shopping if you have some money to spend.  It's not cheap.  The structure is huge, and perhaps the retailers were a bit overly optimistic about traffic volume.  The whole second level of design lab is closed.... kind of like an overly hopeful kid that planned a huge party, and no one showed up!   The coffee shop in A3chive has good coffee.  Not overly impressed with the sullen service by the twenty something crew, BUT they made a good brew.  Some fabulous sculptures outside, so have a good walk around to take it all in."
101,3.0,"Thought there would be more to this place. There is a movie theatre and places to eat at the lower level, but not sure it was what we expected. Could have spent the time somewhere else."
102,4.0,"The plaza design is one of a kind and worthwhile to visit just to see. Especially good for a rainy day. The design shop was puzzling. We most enjoyed seeing the art exhibition on the Korean alphabet Hanguel, which had an entrance fee. Other temporary exhibitions at the time were about Pixar films and Cars - great for families. The dongdaemun history museum is small and interesting, and displays artifacts found at the site, and explains the building of the city wall and gates, so worth a visit."
103,3.0,"Really nothing much.  Most people visit because it is near Dongdaemum and the building design is unique.  The shops within are just a waste of time, in my view."
104,5.0,You can't missed this building if you shop around Dongdaemun. The building structure is very special and big. Take some time to explore the place. Better to visit in the evening as the lights are beautiful.
105,5.0,"This incredible space was design by starchitect Zaha Hadid, the building hosts the Dongdaemun Design Plaza and exhibitions spaces occupying the landscape like a spaceship.  The entire space comes to life at night surrounded by a field of LED flowers.  The impresive building has a futuristic design and deserve a visit by any architecture lover."
106,5.0,I visited the plaza during winter where Fornasetti Practical Madness was featured as the artist.  The lovely architecture of the plaza was even more celebrated with the fusion of Fornasetti's design pieces strategically positioned on every curve of the design plaza.Want to come back for more.
107,4.0,"We liked to walk around this place. Lovely architecture. The design lab inside of one of the buildings was not what we expected, stores that sold some stuff. We thought that it will be some kind of architectural design exhibition."
108,4.0,"The DDP is worth a visit primarily to see this architectural masterpiece by Zaha Hadid, the first woman to receive the Pritzker Architecture Prize. I didn't find the shops particularly interesting, but they're worth a quick visit."
109,5.0,"There is the museum, that is a great piece of architecture. There are different exhibitions going on it during the year.Then you can find a lot of clothes and products from local brands.

111,3.0,"We recently spent an afternoon exploring the Dongdaemun area and found the design plaza truly amazing from an architectural standpoint. It was a cold, windy day but we highly enjoyed viewing the design plaza and the sculpture garden around it. The shops and businesses inside are average. We think seeing the exterior of the design plaza is much more interesting than the interior. It was a fun place to cross off our to do list in Seoul!"
112,4.0,"We were just passing through the way and got a view of Dongdaemun design plaza. Then we just could not put our eyes off the glitterati and beauty of this place at night and walked in. It is a huge architectural wonder which has various art and design studios, shopping places and restaurants.It was fun watching the  musical talent show going on outside which had a huge young and lively audience.All in all it is a complete entertainment package.I would surely recommend this place."
113,5.0,"Great Architecture the Must to visit in Seoul for art and design fans, Enjoy the fantastic space for photo shooting"
114,4.0,"The design is great! It was modern, huge and very interesting. A new place for gather .. hangouts .. and especially becouse the place become a spot for design and arts activities there are much you can do and gather from this place. Very interesting. It also very close to mall where you can find foods and points of attractions. This a place you can spends hours at it."
115,4.0,We visited the plaza after hours when the building was lit up and the retail shops were still open. It is an architectural marvel and close to great shopping at Dongdaemon Market and Doota Mall.
116,4.0,"Great design by Zaha Hadid, easy to reach by metro and near to dongdaemun market and doota mall. Great place to study on architecture detailing (as i'm an architect too) visually attractive and picturesque. There is a mall downstairs and connected to metro station."
117,5.0,"This building is the face of the future. Very modern and very impressive architectural details. You find here also the location of the hit korean TV series ""My Love from the Star""."
118,5.0,It incredible futuristic architecture makes Seoul (together with Tokyo) great cities balancing the old and new! The place is huge and deserves a few hours to be explored.
119,5.0,"We wandered into this place, and were surprised to find all sorts of interesting stuff. I particularly enjoyed the stores with modern design items that I had not seen elsewhere. Some great travel gizmos."
120,3.0,I really wanted to see the building itself. It is quite amazing and defiantly something worth seeing. We had a look through the design plaza and there were many cool items you could buy.
121,1.0,"I`ve no idea why other traveler like this. From outside it looks really great - thats a fact. But inside it is a joke. Half of the building building belongs to conference center and in the other part you can visit ""normal"" exhibitions. The design mall is of course a normal underground. And totally disappointing was the fact, that you can't find anything to do with design."
122,5.0,"The building looks awesome from so many different angles. There is additional artsy stuff to see inside the building. The plaza itself has a lot of open space and sculpture type things. In the surrounding area, you can find lots of stores for shopping too. The whole area is worth a visit."
123,5.0,"This is one of the best masterpieces ever done by the superarchitect, Zaha Hadid.  I visited Seoul over the years to witness its construction, and the end result said it all.  Every nooks and crannies are simply sublime, and yet, they all fit in together and the layouts are in such a coherent manner too.  This Design Plaza is an internal Plaza that's providing a platform for local designers to showcase their ware.  There is a Museum, Galleries (when we were there, there were presentations on Fornasetti, and works from Smithsonian Institute), cafes, green area, shops at the basement that's linking up to the subway station.  There are pianos being placed around the outside of the Plaza and so, from time to time, they might attract proficient pianists whose playing would imbue the environment with music that would elevate our aesthetic appreciation to yet another level.  All in all, Design Plaza to me is magnificent and if there's one thing that you must do in Seoul, make it this one~"
124,4.0,"Seoul is so modern and the architecture here reflects that well. We had a great stroll around this area, which was bustling with tourists. Nice thing to do in and afternoon, if you have it spare."
125,5.0,"It is a modern and amazed architesture and it is good for visitors to tour around this attraction day and night. Also, the park is very close to two different metro stations ""Dongdaemum"" and ""Dongdaemum History & Culture Park"", with walking distance to the old east gate of the city - Dongdaemum, as well as Cheonggyecheon Stream."
126,4.0,"A local called it the Space Shuttle, which does not give justice to this gem of architecture.  The spaces undulate amidst the sometimes monotonous and rigid glass-and-steel buildings that surround it.  Get inside and get lost in the curves and waves as you start on the lower level and end on the 4th floor.  Terriific artwork scattered all around will keep your visit interesting!"
127,4.0,We visited DDP for its well known architectural design but were delightfully surprised to find that the various exhibits were actually quite interesting.  Took tons of amazing pictures with beautiful composition.  Worth a trip whether you are into design or not.
128,5.0,"This place promote Design and Art. For those artistic people should visit this place. You will love this place. The Building itself has already make a sound of it's sound....and it sound like:""D-E-S-I-G-N""."
129,3.0,"It is best to visit DDP in the night when it is lighted up. It looks like a spaceship! There are nice seating areas to wile the time away. Located at the Dongdaemun history and cultural park station, it is accessible and opposite the shopping area."
130,4.0,"Thousand of LED flower at the outdoor of the DDP( Dongdaemum Design Plaza). Nice place to hang out and relax, the place is just right of the exit of the train."
131,4.0,Nice architecture and good design. It really does focus on bringing all what Korea can offer design-wise around this place.
132,4.0,We went there at night and just so happened there was this huge fashion show/award ceremony going on.. So the place was filled with people.. very happening and nice during the night time but probably would be less impressive in the day
133,5.0,The buildings are great examples of the wealth of excellent modern architecture in Seoul.  We enjoyed walking around and seeing the endless curves from different perspectives.  We also enjoyed the excellent sculptures which are part of the complex.  We were there fairly early in the day and did not see anything inside the buildings.  They were between shows and there did not appear to be anything special at that time.
134,4.0,"Very cool building, there are exhibitions and shops, a great place for taking photos. You can access by Metro, if you plan to visit Dongdaemun, you should take a look after shopping."
135,5.0,"The place is worth a visit for its architecture only. As a bonus, it hosts a design museum (which we did not visit due to time constraints) and a lot of design shops. There you can get great stuff for reasonable prices (not cheap, but ok!), and even wandering around these creative shops is a lot of fun."
136,5.0,"Everything from shopping, cafes, and the subway, to design space, museums and galleries, this is a must visit when in seoul. We visited several times over a few days and found something new each time. Very worth a day of wandering."
137,4.0,"We didn't actually go inside the plaza because there were no exhibits we were really interested in, but walking around the building and seeing the architecture was great. It's definitely an interesting building worth seeing in passing."
138,5.0,"Craziest 24 hours of shopping! Great street foods! Must go place in Korea! Bring your luggage carry on if you are planning to shopping seriously. They take credit cards, however, if you want discount of bargain negotiate them you want to pay cash so give me a good deal."
139,4.0,"Dongdaemum Design Plaza displayed some interesting arts, when were there. its nice to walk around on a sunny day, and the surrounding too, and there are many malls for shopping."
140,5.0,"This building has nothing to do with Korean culture. It is an impressive piece of modern architecture. It's facilities are used for fostering creativity, mainly in school age children. Excellent use of tax-payers money."
141,5.0,Lots of warehouse wholesalers nearby. Nothing interesting happening at this site itself when I visited.
142,5.0,"If you are an art/architecture lover who happen to be in the Dongdaemun area, I would highly recommend to visit this place at night, it's very beautiful when it's lit up.I'm not sure if it's a ""must see"" attraction for everyone else, since it's just an interesting building. We didn't enter to see what's inside this building, we just happen to pass by while in the area."
143,4.0,The curvature is impressive reminding one of Bilbao and Disney. Walk around the campus and enjoy the various angles and modern art.
144,4.0,The Plaza is an unbelievable monument which is magic during the night when illuminated. You can find exhibition spaces and art shops close to it.
145,4.0,"My husband and I wanted to see this stunning building designed by renowned architect Zaha Hadid.  Its futuristic design is something to behold.  Three gigantic curved buildings are melded together to form one amazing structure on a huge city block.  It is covered in silvery metal which must reflect and glow at night.  We went in the daytime.  Inside the building are shops, artist work spaces, and art exhibits.  Lots of open air shopping surrounded the buildings on the day we were there.  If you appreciate modern architecture, you must see the DDP."
146,4.0,"The outlook of this design complex is very attractive and unique, especially during night time.   There are various shops selling unique and artistic products.   An icon for those like arts and design.  Also, I appreciate people have enough public area to enjoy walking around this modern complex.  You don't have chance to feel crowded peopled around you.  So good!"
147,5.0,This is a very cool spot to start a walk in a very interesting area of Seoul.  Often lots of events here in the afternoon as well and a walking street not far from here
148,4.0,We were passing by and can't help but to notice this building. It is a very uniquely designed building which looks really artistic.
149,4.0,"Mall with nice design to take a photo with, but im not enter this place. I just go to dong daemun market near here"
150,3.0,"Over the years, City of Seoul has tried to beautify its old neighborhood with spectacular buildings such as this one designed by the legendary architect Zaha Hadid. It is a beauty to the eye of the beholder and perhaps more if you take the building in from the outside.  Absolutely spectacular considering what used to be there for decades - a dilapidated baseball stadium with has been a big part of Korean baseball history. If the exterior of the building and the building itself is a five star, the inner space pales in comparison.  There are knick knack stores everywhere and anywhere combined with children space, etc.  People with younger family may enjoy the inner space of the building but the exterior is where one finds the true Zaha Hadid's vision."
151,5.0,"DDP is an alien building in the context of urban Seoul that one would never miss. However, the building itself offers a wonderful adventure of visually stunning curves of aluminum panels and concrete, which, to me as an Architect has a wonderful afternoon. The place is easily accessed via a dedicated metro station. Content is a bit deprived- not a good place to relax with a cup of coffee but a wonderland for photographers. The building has almost no right angles! There is designer market which you can have 3D-printed selfies in one of the booth."
152,5.0,"The magnificent building is so eye catching and interesting.  There are many different levels and areas to explore.Another trip advisor member had mentioned going at night so we did that as well - it's a must do.There is a great ""Design Shop"" in there as well where you can buy interesting gifts."
153,4.0,"We spent an afternoon here which was great, looking at new designs. There were four exhibitions on but each one required a separate ticket which were about 9000 each. There are a few restaurants and shops nearby."
154,4.0,"This large complex by recently deceased architect Zaha Hadid has to be experienced on the spot. It acts as a large sculpture which changes continually as you move up, down, in and around it. It houses a museum (exhibition of Jean-Paul Gaultier when we were there) and an exhibition-cum-shop of Korean design – pleasant, but nothing earth-shattering"
155,5.0,"Dongdaemun Design Plaza is certainly not to be missed, impossible, in fact. But this massive feat of engineering plays home to art and design exhibits inside and all manner of playful fun outside, at least in the Summertime when we visited. We saw an art exhibit, visited several floors of incredible everyday living design shops, watched a concert on an outdoor stage, played on intriguingly designed outdoor-furniture toys. Certainly a worthwhile stop on your Seoul tour and a worthwhile destination!"
156,4.0,"This was an overwhelming trip! The DDP is HUGE! It was easy to get lost and turned around in, but everywhere we went we saw something new! However, I was afraid that my partner and I missed something because we were so turned around! The main reason we went was for the electronic flower that lite up at night. We weren't there when it was pitch black, but it was dusk enough to see the lights. If you're not really into museum type attractions, I wouldn't plan a day trip there. However if you're in the area and it's getting dark out, I would recommend stopping by and seeing the flowers."
157,3.0,"If you like art, then this place will give you some time to spent time looking at art from young Asian artists. We spent about an hour, hour-and-a-half, overhere. You can buy them, if you like too. The personel are young Korean teenagers, who can help you out. But don't expect too much on the English from them.It is a nice, not too expensive stop in busy Seoul. If you don't like art, the skip the inside."
158,5.0,It certainly shines during the day but it really come into its own during the evening when the district comes to life
159,4.0,Nice huge area where talented aspiring local artists and performers put up shows every evening. Good place to walk around for local art scene.
160,5.0,"As an admirer of Dame Zaha's work, the Dongdaemum Design Plaza is my must go in Seoul.  We ended visiting the Plaza three times.  One in the morning, one in the afternoon and one in the evening.  It's a very impressive and one really need to see it from afar, see it up close and see it from within to truly appreciate what Dame Zaha had created.  Heads off to Dame Zaha for her vision and courage.  Heads off to the South Korean government to commission this urban regeneration project."
161,4.0,"With its futuristic design structure, the DDP embodies building of the future. Some nice shops also add to the experience."
162,4.0,"Dongdaemun Design Plaza also know as DDP is unique structure a blend of traditional buildings and cutting edge modern multicultural facilities. We just walk around the path of DDP and trust me it's worth it. With Lights on.. it looked amazing.Also, opp DDP you can find shopping mall and shopping street with local eatery on road side.Plan a visit at this place after sunset or late evening."
163,5.0,"My wife and I stayed at a hotel near the Design Plaza and were intriqued by its beauty and size.  As some had mentioned, its lighting at night served to draw walkers to come closer.  Seoul has so many attractions, it is difficult to choose the ones to visit, but the Dongdaemun Design Plaza is # one...along with the many historical building such as the Changdeokgung Palace.  I truly admire the Korean's preservation of its history alongside its  new beauty."
164,4.0,If interested in architecture and shapes and the blending of the living space this is a must visit. Very futuristic development and the design centre for the country.
165,3.0,"I love taking picture of it at night time. It looked like a spaceship. When I got there at day time, the feeling was different. It's just next to the metro station. Very convenient and worth to go."
166,5.0,"Good place to visit, you will enjoy the design, there is acity bus tour from here if you want to see around."
167,5.0,"This thing (?) is right next to Dongdaemun shopping district, so we checked it out after we shop at Dongdaemun. This huge metal(?)  architect building was lit up with nice lighting ad the lawn was covered with LED lights to simulate flowers. A park like setting within and around the building made a nice refuge to a weary city walkers. The museum and shopping centers are all around. Good place to just hangout and watch people and cuddle with your loved ones.   ."
168,5.0,This is a place worth to visit.  Looking at the designs and the structure of the buildings is impressive enough.  You will be surprised by the architect works and how it was being wrecked down from a stadium to such a building place now.
169,4.0,"we came just before sunset and said ""meh,"" then we went across the street to a department store.  After finishing our shopping, we were on the top floor with a view of DDP --- we said ""OMG"".To our surprise, the once-meh monstrosity was lit up with beautiful LED lighting, and the park/plaza with more of the same, including those thousands of fake flowers.  During the day = 2 starsAt night = 4 stars"
170,5.0,Take the time to walk around this undulating structure to enjoy the full beauty of it.Then take a break and come inside to enjoy the restaurants and shopping.
171,5.0,"Good for shopping and sightseeing, lots everything in here and had a lots travelers. And easy to go there by subway"
172,4.0,"went duing daytime and visited the design lab, special, but perhaps more of modern stuff which may be able to find elsewhere too. can at night for the LED roses."
173,5.0,Go for a walkthrough of an architectural masterpiece. It's a spaceship sitting in the centre of Seoul city. There's a gorgeous valley of paper flowers and few other 'artsy' design booths. Its linked to the subway and is a short walk from the big flea market and shops.
174,3.0,Lacks atmosphere even though the design is fantastic  and some of the exhibits including the LED roses are really good ( can't help thinking the concept was copied from the London Poppies though ) it's a short 30 minute visit at most
175,3.0,"We had seen the very impressive buidling with its strong flowing lines on arrival at Dongdaemun but my wife was more interested in the many shopping buildings and options in the neighbourhood.  At the end of the day, when we were trudging back towards the Metro, we decided to visit this building.  There are exhibitions across several floors, with some where you have to pay, it seems.  I loved the exhibits on the ground floor, where they have a gift shop and display of items that are helpful in daily lives, such as kitchenware and utensils.  There were also several benches made of sculptures that you could sit and rest your feet.Do spare a few minutes to visit this place - it is worth the time."
176,4.0,I like it and I don't hahaha :-) walking around is interesting and you need around 3 hours to see it all.  They could have done more for helping people getting around as it is a hugeeee area. The shop is a highlight at DDP THE architecture is spectacular and I suggest a visit to the info desk before starting to look around :-)
177,4.0,"Our hotel was essentially next to Dongdaemun Design Plaza.  However, I ventured out to explore it only once.  We had stumbled into the underground shopping areas when exiting (the wrong way) from the metro.  It was so cold and blustery during our February visit to Seoul that my walk around the Design Plaza was pretty cursory.  I imagine that in spring and summer, this could be a really beautiful park-like setting.  It takes up a city block and is dominated by the spaceship design that covers much of that block.  It's quite a landmark that always helped me keep oriented while in Dongdaemun.  The picture of the map of the Design Plaza I have attached probably explains what's in it better than my description and other pictures."
178,3.0,The place is nice to visit to take picture. Nothing much else you can do other then visit the gallery.or do some shopping for local designer brands. Mostly young local will go there and chill. Wait till at night for the led rose garden. Very beautiful.
179,5.0,"DDP is a great place to visit for everyone. I enjoy visiting often for exhibits and unusual arts and one of a kind furnishings. They often have free outdoor events and decorations to enjoy. There are places to grab snacks and coffee. Right across from the famous shopping malls Doota and Migliore, as well as many large shopping malls within a half mile radius, so it's easy to spend a whole day here."
180,4.0,"When the only bad thing to say about a place is that there's just too much to see, it's a good sign.At the time of my visit there were the LED Roses in the garden area, Hyundai's concept car design exhibit and a smattering of others.Keep an eye on what's on offer at the DDP and if something that interests you happens to be on, don't hesitate to plan a visit."
181,5.0,I still can't wrap my brain around the design. You'll need to visit it to get what I mean. Don't forget to visit the museum too!
182,5.0,"There are some design exhibitions and stalls in this plaza which are worth visiting. Maybe you would like to take a look at their washrooms too, their washrooms are quite special as they've got an auto-heat toilet seat which is not so common in Korea's public washrooms."
183,5.0,"Well what can you say about the architecture of the building - amazing. Make sure too check out the grounds of the property as they are great. If you want a spot of shopping the design market on site has some quirky things that you can buy and easily fit in your suitcase. It isn't lite as well as I would expect at night, so visiting on a clear day makes for better pics."
184,4.0,"This place is worth the visit if only for the bold design by Zaha Hadid.The exhibitions are of varied interest, make sure to pick what you really like.Many shopping and food options in the immediate vicinity."
185,3.0,Nice design but not great to deliberately make a trip there. Took a walk around since i was going to the malls opposite.
186,5.0,We came across this area by mistake and were really glad we did. Incredible architecture and there was a mini festival going on the day we were there with bands playing and skateboard competitions. The building are incredible. Well worth a visit
187,5.0,What an awe-inspiring design! Great LED rose garden and fun shopping inside.  We didn't get a chance to see the exhibits but definitely enjoyed browsing the shopping area.
188,3.0,"very nice and large building, selling arty stuffs and ""new designs"" items. definitely worth checking it out"
189,4.0,The wide open and futuristic spaces are a real thrill to explore - like being on a movie set. Absolutely beautiful!
190,5.0,"Having read the reviews on TA for this place, I wasn't sure what to expect. The outside of the building is beautiful and awe inspiring (even on a grey day!). We spent quite a lot of time wandering around and viewing the building from as many aspects as possible. The design lab is a really cool collection of shops/stalls from designers all around the world. There are lots of unique, innovative products on sale here and it felt more like an Expo/design show than a shopping mall as others have commented. I really enjoyed looking at and playing with the products. Unusually for Korea, no one followed me round and the lack of high pressure sales actually made it very enjoyable. We then went into the Sculpture in Motion area, again, completely unaware of what to expect! Signage is not very good at this venue so it's a case of 'explore and see'! We found a free of charge sculpture exhibition by Hyundai and their partners. It was a fab two room exhibition of sound, sculpture, audio visual exhibits. We spent over an hour in there alone! Next we went into the shopping centre/mall and got a smoothie before looking at the concept cars and then taking the metro elsewhere. Overall a fab visit! I would recommend that you go for certain. There are some rooms that aren't used and we didn't visit the paid for exhibits so there was even more to see and do."
191,5.0,"A new addition to Seoul's Dongdaemun area. There are always events and festivals happening here, so always something to see. There is also a museum and shop inside. On the bottom floor there is a small mall and restaurant area. Been here many times for dinner and the restaurants are very good. Stay around for night time when the whole place lights up and LED light place light shows on the side of parts of the building. Definitely bring along your camera to snap some photos. Very cool place."
192,5.0,This is not just a good place to shop but also to appreciate how architecture and cultural and historic footprint is preserved amidst the throes of commercialisation.
193,5.0,"The historic site next to the Design plaza is worth visiting. The infra-structures of the old Seoul town is amazing.Of course, you wouldn't miss the whole sales markets (you can actually buy just a few pieces)crossing the bridge along the river banks."
194,4.0,Very interesting when it comes to the design world for the space ship look on the outside to the inside full of opportunities for the shopper or history seeker.
195,4.0,Come here at night to take some great pics - this building is truly unique + it hosts art installations and design markets! We were lucky enough to experience one of these little markets and it was great for design gift shopping.
196,5.0,"This building is amazing, there's nothing else like it anywhere. It looks awesome during the and even more so at night."
197,2.0,So I expected this awesome building to be filled with interesting things as impressive as the exterior however felt a bit disappointed when I stepped inside to find it more like a swapmeet.  A ton of little random shops selling items from lighters to luggage.  Do go later in the day to see the LED flowers outside and take stunning pictures of the exterior but don't expect too much inside the building.
198,3.0,"it's a great place to see an artsy stuff. In the night, there is spot which has an LED flower.  Great to take picture."
199,4.0,"An excellent choice far from the hyper-shopping building around Dongdaemun area. Full of art galleries, shops and other venues (including subway lines below). Most of the galleries close at 7-8pm so better spend your time here during day and later you can go and get crazy buying k-pop clothes nearby; these close at 6am...."
200,4.0,very impressive big building but very little inside did purchase a few things but would not return very quiet not many people visiting it
201,5.0,One of the most impressive buildings in Seoul. Lots of exhibitions and things to see inside. Must see at night also.
202,5.0,"Nice and futuristic. The place not too crowded and I went on Friday, there were some flea market. It provided street food.Nice picture with the led roses."
203,4.0,"This design plaza is new, modern, fun and exciting at the same time. Close to the famous malls, but also to the older market streets in the area."
204,5.0,"The Dongdaemun Design Plaza is an architectural masterpiece which will warm its way to anyone's heart, especially is you are a lover of unique designs"
205,4.0,The design of this complex is quite amazing. Some interesting and unique  shops inside as well.  Definitely worth seeing!
206,5.0,"Located in the center of Dongdaemun area which is the most recent construction opened in 2014 is the newest and most iconic landmark of the Korean design industry. It has 5levels.This place is awesome at night for photography, the Led displays are stunning!!"
207,4.0,Beautiful architecture building with some nice spots for photo at night. Personally like the white LED flower the most.
208,3.0,"Loved the architecture of the DDP. Inside, I expected to find something more exquisite, but was disappointed with shops and more commercial stuff. But one could spend an hour just walking around the building and soaking in the architecture"
209,4.0,One of the most architecturally amazing buildings I have ever seen.  A little hard to navigate when reading the floor plan due to its asymmetrical design.
210,4.0,A marvelous design building. Lots of shops inside the building with an attached subway station @ Dongdenmun Cultural park station. Inside the building has a TonyMoly and Innisfree cosmetic shops.
211,5.0,The architectural itself is amazing. When go inside even more surprised by the different designer's shops and art exhibition. Sunday food and goods market also is fun to go.
212,4.0,"This is a great place for art, craft, design and creativity. A great building to look at and be within. I like the fact there are no straight walls. There are art installations inside and out and a chance to pick up some unique wears by independant traders."
213,3.0,"We ended up here by mistake. Different architecture. Some shopping, but not what we were looking for."
214,2.0,Really interesting architecture but nothing much happening when we were there. May be better at night when illuminated
215,2.0,"Nice from a distance and some interesting exhibitions from time to time, but must be one of the worst designed buildings ever.  Signage is terrible and while looks good is not people friendly."
216,4.0,If you are in Seoul you cannot missed one of the most interesting buildings designed by Zaha Hasid. You should go around 5 pm to see the building during the day and night. Always you have interesting exhibitions.  You can see there everything on gadgets and design.  I have dinner there.  Best way to go? Metro.
217,5.0,"For me this was the highlight of Seoul. It is an amazing structure with such intricate detail, it's hard not to appreciate it. Inside you could spend a whole day just walking around marvelling at all of the cool and quirky things inside. Definitely don't miss out, we almost didn't go because we mistakenly thought it was just a fancy shopping center."
218,4.0,"Cool building you can walk around. there are a few places to take good portrait pictures, but it looks better from the outside. If you are in the area I would definitely suggest checking it out, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it or the horrible clothes malls across the street that sell mainly Chinese imported clothes at a premium price."
219,5.0,"Stop the press!  This is such a happening place to be in Seoul.  Art exhibits rotate through inside space-age, post-modern architecture.  And outside, the grounds are a far out melange of past, present, and future.  Stay inside during the hot days, and enjoy the grounds at night.  Food trucks offer some great food, and there's always stuff going down:  craft fairs, local music platforms, beautiful incandescent fields of flowers...There's also terrific shopping nearby."
220,5.0,"An enormous building, with plenty of things happening.  The shops inside were filled with amazing nicknacks and souveneirs.  A LED flower display was happening while I was there and it was  an amazing site."
221,2.0,"We decided to visit Dongdaemun Design Plaza because of its raving reviews. Unfortunately it was not quite worth the trip though the shopping malls around it made it better. The building is fascinating and artistic. However, other than that, there is nothing else to do there."
222,4.0,"that morden architecture just like a huge space ship, quite funny and unrealistic where located near the Dongdaemun, especially at night time, just like in the space!!!"
223,5.0,"what a great architecture, lucky for us to found this place. and truly is a must visit place. artistic and amazing, inside the building is store and gallery. not much to explore it."
224,5.0,"Dont know the history why Seoul build this building, but this building really has a high class architecture design. its very good if you visit at night for take a picture. unfortunately i didnt go inside. the location is eazy to access, just take a subway and stop at dongdaemun station or you can walk from myengdong around 20 minutes. just follow the road sign."
225,5.0,"This place is definitely a highlight of modern Seoul. The architecture is simply breathtaking! There are plenty of temporary expositions, a design gallery, restored parts of the ancient walls, shops, and so on. But just wandering on the inside of the compound is already an almost magical experience.If you're into photography come in the morning or at sunset to capture all the waved lines with a special hue."
226,5.0,"If you are into contemporary architecture and modern design, you can easily spend a few hours at this place. The architecture is very organic and offers a sleek view from every angle, inside and out. There are lots of design related exhibitions and shops in the building, and very good restaurants too. The place is located in the middle of town surrounded by lots of shopping and restaurants. We spent 4-5 hours here and wish there was more time."
227,5.0,"This is a great place to visit day or evening. At night, the exhibitions are closed, but it is lovely to walk around, especially with a partner. If you love architecture, it shouldn't be skipped on your trip. Make sure to travel around back to see the lighted rose garden. The whole place is a photographer's dream; make sure to bring a tripod for long exposure shots."
228,5.0,"Absolutely breathtaking example of modern architecture of organic design. Wonderful views at night, must see. There is interesting design shop full of various items to bring home as a souvenir. LED-roses field (enjoy it after sunset) is mesmerizing!"
229,4.0,"DDP, only one-year old, might already be one of Seoul's most iconic buildings. Unlike anything else in the city, the best way I can think of to describe it is ""Alien Mothership"". This futuristic impression is reinforced by the use of lightning, LED panels and smart technologies in and around the premises. A very interesting thing about DDP is that it blends the distinction between the inside, the outside, the plaza, the garden... Everything is integrated and mixes together remarkably well. You have a garden on the roof, outside tunnels between buildings, antique vestiges at the foot of LED-lit metallic buildings,... It is truly a magnificent structure. The surrounding neighborhood is a bit less spectacular. The DDP is not directly connected to nor offers a direct view of Cheonghyecheon or the Dongdaemun gate, and buildings around DDP are mostly slightly old Department Stores. These buildings are not modern and high enough to be visually appealing (such as central Jongro or Myeongdong), nor traditional enough to feel truly authentic (as might feel the rest of the Euljiro district just west of DDP). As to what there is to do inside the DDP, it depends if you value quality over quantity. There are not a lot of exhibition halls, or shops inside DDP, at least not as many as one could expect. So some might be disappointed. However, qualitatively speaking, I think that all the museums, designer centers, exhibitions or even stores are really interesting. The Hyundai-sponsored museum offers some great exhibitions, the huge designer store presents many highly imaginative and quirky items, and there are a few other places worth mentioning. I think that for such a building, focusing on the quality of the artworks and designs presented to the public was a better choice that having loads of less interesting stores/displays/museum, so I'd also give a thumbs up to DDP for that as well. Finally, the place is always evolving: exhibitions change, some stores and halls have yet to open so the Dongdaemun Design Plaza should get even more interesting as time goes by."
230,5.0,The building is stunning. Just go inside and see the free exhibitions - and the stunning staircase. Well worth a visit when around
231,5.0,"According to the Guidebook, this structure, designed by the famous Iraqi - British lady architect Zaha Hadid, was completed and opened in 2014. It now houses a variety of art and design exhibitions, hosts various events and also contains some fairly upmarket shops and restaurants.The exterior shell of the building is clad with (apparently) 45,133 aluminium panels (didn't check!), all of which are allegedly different. (I rather doubt that, although the hugely complex and futuristic 'organic' shape must have given the construction team some sleepless nights!There is a website for the structure which has some excellent photos and is well worth a look.We had a good wander round but had to leave long before exploring everywhere. I thought it was hugely impressive and a notable prestige project. It will be interesting to see how it ages. When we were visiting, the structure and its surroundings were being used by yet another United Nations ""Sustainability and Climate Change"" junket, as a marshalling / assembly point for a march by bureaucrats (both local and flown in from around the planet), presumably to City Hall (where the 'Conference' was being held) and arguing the 'evils' of CO2. As the ""carbon footprint"" of this concrete / steel / aluminium / glass project must have greatly exceeded the annual 'footprint' of several smaller Pacific nations, I confess I found this a trifle ironic. Fortunately, the design team seem not to have allowed their creativity to be unduly restrained by this currently fashionable idea. I don't think a Yurt of recycled bin bags would have quite the same impact."
232,5.0,"That's what it replaced. Unique design, with many most interesting exhibits inside. The rounded-off buildings are really exceptional, and on a very large scale too without intimidating the visitor.Inside, it doesn't look that much like it's in a UFO-type building, but also very well designed. Well worth an extended visit.I guess it's going to look very dated, but then, so do Gothic cathedrals."
233,5.0,Vibrant neighbor and busy street. Quite new place in Seoul. They tried to hold a lot of experimental events. So I think here needs more maps.
234,4.0,"First, if you enjoy futuristic buildings then you will enjoy the archetecture of Dongdaemun Design Plaza.  Even more, ensure you go through the various design centers to see what emerging designers are doing for Korean design.  Plenty of shopping malls are also around if you want what everyone else has..."
235,4.0,"We visited the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) on our free 5 hour layover tour provided by the Incheon Airport.  The Incheon Airport provides free Korean Transit tours for those with long layovers and even provided warm, down parkas because the temp was wind chill - 10 C. We only had to pay for a very inexpensive lunch at the shopping mall across from the DDP.  It was an interesting design and one the Koreans are rightly proud of.  The tour started at 10 am and ended at 3 pm.  Check into the free tours offered at the airport.  They have 1, 2, 3 & 5 hour tours to numerous sites.  The best time to visit South Korea per our tour guide is March and April.  February was quite cold."
236,3.0,"Yes, it's an interesting piece of (futuristic) art in the middle of one of the key shopping and dining destinations in Seoul, and stands in sharp contrast to the old Dongdaemun Gate. Beyond admiring the curves, however, there's really nothing much to it. The shops under the plaza are quiet and empty (if I may add, suffering from the extremely low flow of visitors), and makes for quite a depressing walk through."
237,5.0,Very impressive and modernistic. Good way to while away a few hours in Seoul. Did not manage to catch any of the conducted tours round the place but the whole area is very easy to explore.
238,4.0,"There used to be a baseball stadium where this park now stands (there's even a memorial for the stadium!).The designer parks feature some crazy and almost unreal architecture wonders – beautiful modern buildings, housing numerous exhibitions, galleries and conferences.While the park is not intended to be a museum, nor doesn't it have a museum ""feel"" to it, any art lover (and an architecture enthusiast) would absolutely love this place.Take the time to walk the long way up one of the domes on the inner slope. the perspective of the staircase from above is so worth the effort.You need 90-120 minutes to explore this park in detail.Highly recommended."
239,4.0,Futuristic construction. Enjoyed walking through and looking through all the stores and displays. Didn't buy anything but still really enjoyed looking around. There is a lot more to look at in the area so I'd recommend paying it a visit.
240,5.0,"First of all, the architectural marvel designed by Zaha Hadid is just eye-catching, there is no way to miss it, walking around the DongDaeMun area. It is a bit of a weird location actually, nestled in between bargain shopping and higher-end shopping (Doota, Lotte Fitin), but definitely this is a must go, if only to balk at the supremely organic building.It is free to enter, with some exhibitions charging a minimal entrance fee, but do put aside a whole day. Yes, a whole day, to walk and explore the building. I am not sure if that was the design intent, but walking into and through the building, was like wandering in a cavernous animal. There are several ""wings"", a splendid roof area of electric led roses art installation, and a few shops. The roof also offers an amazing vantage of the shopping district, and the lights at night are nice.The main museum shop was a good place to get affordable souvenirs, we enjoyed seeing quality designed goods, that can be purchased without the exorbitant prices of other museum shops (e.g.: MoMa, Tate Modern). We picked up a few pieces of printed chocolate bars, Tyvek tote-bags and a stylish new pocketbook pen, all for less than USD50. It was good quality, design-intended, and at a bargain price.Shopping aside, the exhibitions themselves are varied. Some are full-blown masterpieces, while others are Graduation Shows, or travelling exhibits and pop-up installations. The best bet is to head to a information counter, and get a run-down of the active exhibitions, along with a MAP. Alternatively, a quick visit to the DDP website, will also bring you up to speed and focus in on exhibitions of special interest to you, if you are short of time.The building grounds, also serve as a social gathering point, so it is a marvellous place for people-watching. Seeing Koreans coming in families, groups of friends, to see how they interact and enjoy the building is also interesting. They take lots of photos, and cute poses.Across our travels, and as a museum designer by profession, there is nothing quite like the DDP. Conceptually, it is more than a museum, but a complex housing various degrees of Art and Design, which makes it quite unique in itself. Whether you are a Zaha Hadid  or architecture fan, this is definitely one of the places in Seoul to visit, even better than some of the so-called ""proper"" museums. One thing to note, it is closed on Mondays."
241,3.0,"Looks nice but there was not much else to do. If you are planning to visit this area anyway then go and see it, but don't make a long journey just for this place."
242,4.0,"This area looks very new and has a small but ok mall inside. We tried to go to the nearby history museum but got there too late and it was already closed. The area though is worth a visit to see really the cutting edge of Seoul, and watch people shop their lives away. I thought Americans loved to shop but Koreans are at another level."
243,4.0,"If you take metro line 4 and exit at Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station exit 1 - you will arrive at this magnificent space resembling something out of a science fiction movie. The overall layout is a bit confusing but it's nice to get lost and discover the plaza from different angles. I went during the day and it was very busy, hard to get a nice picture without someone's head getting in the way. I visited the space again a night and I was able to appreciate the space much more. I visited the Design Market - although it offers many different independent/local designer items, I found most of it a bit expensive and some of it a repetition of what I have seen in other department stores/tourist attractions. The indoor space also does not reflect the same architectural details on the outside. The actual functional indoor space was so poorly planned. The maps were also a bit useless if you are actually trying to find where the exhibits are. Nice place - but do try to visit it at night - it's more impressive."
244,3.0,"Architecturally awesome, but ends there.	My spouse is a huge Doctor Who fan so we decided to visit the Dongdaemun Design Plaza today because something she referred to as a TARDIS was there.  I guess it is a big deal to have your photo taken with a blue phone booth from the UK.  Anyway, we have passed by this place before and did not realize it was so big.  We took our dog with us, the exterior areas were dog friendly, and I took a few photos of my spouse with the awkwardly placed blue phone booth.  After the photos, we took the dog home and returned to check out the Transformers 30th anniversary exhibit.  I am a huge Transformers fan (I ordered a new (2010) Camaro based on the video from the first movie, before seeing one in person).  I was disappointed in the display.  It was 30,000 won for two people to look at a few original concept art displays and some (limited) action figures as well as a couple of original comics.  We considered checking out another display in the Plaza, but after the Transformers let down, we refrained."
245,4.0,"I went to Dongdaemun Design Plaza with great expectations. It was supposed to be this great exhibition of architecture and culture. I found it to be bustling with groups of people: couples, families, friends. The building itself is quite nice, and some of the random modern art exhibits are really interesting. This cultural landmark, though, is really here to sell you things. The premises is littered with shops. Even beyond the free areas - beyond the payment gates into various exhibitions - shops seemed to be everywhere. I liked the area for the roominess of it, for the art and cultural experience, but I didn't go to DDP to shop for clothes or stuffed animals - there seem to already be enough of that in Dongdaemun as it is."
