0,3.0,The market was smaller than we expected with only around 20 -25 stalls on the day we visited. It’s in a very lively area with lots of shops and drinking places. Probably not worth a special trip but if you’re in the area...
1,5.0,Another gem provided by our driver.  We met an artist who did wonderful oil paint reproductions of actual photographs for an very low cost.  We visited the market in the afternoon and paintings of our three grandkids and two of my favorite airplanes were delivered to our hotel by seven in gathering evening.  Lots of neat Korean art items.
2,3.0,"A place for youngsters and teens. Lots of apparel shops, cafes etc. There were teens performing K pop dance and songs. We went on a Monday so it was not really crowded. A must go place for the young and young at heart."
3,5.0,"Lots of great stores here, clothing and skin care come to mind, oh and shoes.  Didn't see an Art Market, though saw many signs of art on the street.  Street perfomers, good bars and restaurants and street performers, what more could you want!"
4,3.0,"This place stands out as a place for the young people. Lots of shops, cafes & restaurants catering to this group of people.Many aspiring K-Poppers (either dancing or singing) perform in the open walkways. Hoping to get lucky to catch the eye of scouts.But be careful- there was a news report from Korea yesterday about some aggressive performers pulling the audiences' hairs ( see picture). Other than this, it is about the same as any other shopping streets in Seoul. Just come walk around if you have time to kill or has never come here before. Or if you would like to watch the potential K-Poppers performances."
5,1.0,"Should have done research. Went there Monday noon time. Nothing going on, at all. Area around has little shops selling clothes mostly."
6,4.0,"It was snowing when we were here. Lots of young people.As it was snowing and lots of people, it wasn't very conducive to shop. Very cumbersome if you want to buy clothes as you have to take off your winter wear etc...There are many restaurants, cafes, street food and fashion outlets. It should be a nice place to shop if it is not snowing or over-crowding."
7,5.0,"Hongdae Free Market is as good as Myeongdong and Ihwa or even better than these two areas. The visitors are mostly teens and students that studying in Hongik University. Many things to buy and foods are great after all. Of course, souvenirs are available as well."
8,3.0,"Well, it is a street market with some atmosphere, but I wouldn't say there is something extraordinary there."
9,4.0,"We had our individual caricature drawn here. The lady was really talented ! And she took only a mere 2-3 mins to complete it. Drawing it based on eye contact, she traces our faces on a sheet of clear plastic placed in front of us on an easel. She's so popular that it formed a long queue. Waiting in the hot summer certainly wasn't a good choice but hey paying only 3,000 won and getting a good picture was worth it."
10,5.0,"I loved it there. A lot of stores, little shops and restaurants. I even found a few Vintage Stores which was really nice. Absolutely a Market to check out."
11,4.0,"Its not exactly cheap and the food variety are not as much as Myeongdong but for youngsters, this might be where they want to be during a trip to Seoul. New trendy clothes, students from nearby Honggik University performing and many good bites all around. Recommended for young couples."
12,4.0,"If you are into shopping, then you might want to stick with Myeong Dong. If you want cheap souvenirs, go to Insa Dong but if you want to party and have some beers at clubs than come to Hongdae. During the day, it is calm and peaceful and you can grab a bite to eat and shop at some craft stores and souvenir shops but then the atmosphere changes completely at night and becomes a place where younger and more hipster looking folk come out to have a good time. It is not a sleazy area at all but definitely it’s a younger crowd just looking for some fun. I was looking for a massage place and they are plenty here but they are so dang expensive in Korea and comparable to American prices that I just passed on that. It’s worth a look in my opinion even if you don’t club and bar hop as I don’t but still had a good time people watching with my wife."
13,5.0,"I'm not sure if I am the only one who felt this way, but Myeongdong didn't seem as happening as when I visited 3 years ago.  The whole place seem to be swarming with foreign tourists, and for me if I go to another country, it would be nice to see more local people than foreign tourists.  Recently, the shops in Myeongdong seemed more and more targeted towards the tourist population.  In comparison, we stumbled upon Hongdae when we exited from Sangsu station looking for an ice-cream shop.  Unlike Myeongdong, this district has many small local shops and were patronised by mainly local young people with much less foreigners.   As another reviewer said, you can get the latest trendy clothes at a cheaper price. The buildings and shops also seem more colourful, modern and classy.  In contrast Myeongdong seems more jaded compared with 3 years ago.  Perhaps, this has to do with the fact that the University is nearby.   We saw this as an up and coming shopping and clubbing place, and good option to visit because it gets overtaken by tourists like Myeongdong."
