The echo area also has elevated decking paths where you can explore the flora in this area of Korea, with plenty of labels annotating the species of the various trees."

3,4.0,This is a nice large park in the middle of the busy city.  There are various parts of different sections with different themes.  You can rent a bike to ride around.  A good place to spend some time away from the hustle and bustle of the city.  Very busy during the weekends with the locals coming with their family.

Decided to try a few things and I do not regret it. Even without the food trucks, I would still recommend this park for those that love to walk and love nature."

Its a great place to ride your bike or go for a jog. If you are dating someone, you need to take them during the cherry blossom season. You just might get lucky, lol."
