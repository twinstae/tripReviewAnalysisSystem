0,5.0,We applied for the tour at the website and we got an English fluent tour guide who guided us around Jeoldusan. She explained us about Korean Catholic history and martyrdom and also about Jeoldusan itself. We also had a good time meeting the head priest of the church and he was really nice to us!
1,5.0,Its a great place to visit especially for Catholics. A volunteer guide will be assigned to each tour group. They will walk you through the rich history of the beginnings of the Korean church.
