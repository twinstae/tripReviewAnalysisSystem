0,4.0,"Hundreds of vendors with a huge diversity of product in one compact building on multiple floors. Great place to outfit a wardrobe for a makeover, new career, or new season."
1,1.0,Do not bother wasting your time in this mall especially in the males section . Aggressive sellers trying to coerce you to buy super overpriced goods with nasty attitude when you donâ€™t buy from them
2,3.0,"We went in early morning. Hence, there was no crowd. The layout is similar to Bangkok Platinum mall. Every level selling specific stuffs. Lower level for apparel, higher level for bags, shoes, accessories, luggage. Quite a good place to shop if you know what you want."
3,3.0,We have been to Migliore on previous trips and found this place had somewhat deteriorated. There were more empty units and the range seemed to be become lesser. The men's section on the 4th floor was quite scary as the sellers were more aggressive. There were a lot less shoppers as compared to 2 years ago in the same mall. The prices didnt seem as cheap anymore. We bought much lesser this time round. Will try the malls beside in the dongdaemun area the next time.
4,3.0,"Dongdaemun area is a shopping paradise and Migliore is a multi storey store in the midst of it. Itâ€™s crowded with little shops organised around a theme eg womenâ€™s, childrenâ€™s etc, but thatâ€™s about all there is in organisation! All the stores sell varied and sometimes duplicative items but if you persist, there are some good buys to be had."
5,3.0,This is a lower end shopping mall as compared to nearby Doota.This shopping mall is opened until 5am.Mostly clothing for men and women but more women's clothing.Price of the items can be further reduced by 10% - 30%.There is no changing room to try the clothing. Only wrap a scarf around you while changing. Try figuring out yourself ðŸ˜€The upper floors are for mens. They tend to be very pushy and aggressive. So be careful. There is no restaurant but a couple of shops selling beverages.
6,2.0,"Got coerced into getting a t-shirt for 20,000 won. Saw the same shirt going for much cheaper at Migliore Myeongdong. Don't believe the hype about low prices. I believe prices have risen thanks to the increasing popularity of the place."
7,5.0,"Love every moment there. They have a sale going on, which was brilliant. There are many different local designers that was featured in that place, and is definitely worth a trip there if you are fashion conscious, or have teenagers in tow."
8,3.0,"Not a place to go if you want anything somewhat high-end (or low-end..), but is a good place to spend your time at 3am if you are jetlagged and slept for 8 hours of the evening... Come ready to negotiate and never pay the original price. They'll usually drop it 10% before you even ask for a price. Once you've been here, no point in going to any of the other shopping complexes as they are pretty much identical."
9,2.0,It's okay.. Prices are actually much more expensive as compared to similar items made in korea on online website qoo10. (Eg a $25 top would be.. Less than $20 online) It's annoying to keep bargaining too because the prices are really jacked up. Didn't enjoy my time here. I would recommend edae or hongdae shopping over this place
