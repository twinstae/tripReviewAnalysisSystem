1,4.0,"This very nice shopping mall was located a short walk from our hotel in Dongdaemun and just across the road from the Dongdaemun Design Plaza.It isn't a huge mall but it does have a large Uniqlo store, a metro station, a play area for kids, massage chairs and lots of nice places to eat and drink. We bought clothes in Uniqlo, let the kids play in the playground in the basement and then had a nice Japanese curry meal upstairs."
2,4.0,This mall is more mid to high level merchandise. Clothing are of higher quality but so are prices too. They do have a fancy food court on the 7th floor but seems to be really quiet.
3,3.0,There are many small stores that make up this mult-storey shopping building. It is near Good Morning City and Apm Building. We just went to have a look. The nice thing is that there is a tax refund right in there where you can get your money back straightaway away.  It also has Subway fast food restaurant not far from it.
4,4.0,"We can buy clothes and anything in this mall and then get tax refund up to 8% at the tax refund counter on 8th floor.Good to buy Uniqlo from Japan, and ABC mart for shoes. You may try good buffet at Season's table on 7 floor. Dinner rate is 23,900 won while lunch rate is about 14900 won. We had dinner here so unsure with lunch rate."
