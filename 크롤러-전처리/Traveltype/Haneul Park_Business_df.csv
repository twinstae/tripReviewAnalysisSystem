0,5.0,Visiting this place requires some stamina. The views and the experience worth the efforts. You can either climb up the stairs or walk on steep hills leading up to the park. I personally find stairs climbing much more easier.The silvergrass in autumn brings a sense of calm with a hint of sadness (maybe it was just me). Absolutely poetic if you are sentimental. Recommended to visit at least once during autumn season.
