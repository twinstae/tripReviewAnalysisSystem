1,4.0,"I enjoyed my first visit to this museum about five years ago. Then I knew a little about Korean history and in particular the events leaded to the division of the peninsula, the Korean War, and the emergence of modern Korea.There's still a lot of information there for those who want to know about how the country that makes Samsung smartphones and other electronic products, produces very good cars, and is one of the world's busiest economies.On this recent trip I chanced on a special exhibition about Jeju and in particular, the bloody events that took place in 1948,Jeju is marketed as a picturesque island (many Korean moves and TV shows are shot there) and locals and visitors are charmed by its beauty.But it has a dark past as this exhibition shows. I'm reasonably stoic but some of the exhibits were a little unnerving. So much bloodshed and death.I'll not spoil the story for you but at the entrance there is a screening of art associated with the events of that time set to music written specially for it. It's hard to remember but the title had Camillias in it. It was heart-wrenching stuff.I'm doing a little more reading on the subject but the exhibition tells the story well. Don't miss it.The regular exhibits are, as I have mentioned in an earlier review, very good. I'm a historian by training and was impressed by the even-handedness of the information provided."
2,4.0,The visit to the museum was very informative as the museum focuses on the exciting history of modern and contemporary history of Korea. It has a massive repository of valuable historic objects. Must visit if you're in Seoul.
3,4.0,This is a good visual museum with exhibits mostly by decade.  It provides a nice overview of how far South Korea has come in the last 60+ years. Did I mention it's free admission. Worth an hour or two of your time.
4,5.0,"The period covered is from 1850 to present day. Admission free, headset with commentary also Free! This was a real eye opener for a non Korean especially for the period 1941 onwards. The South Korean people are to be admired for the adversity that hey have overcome.Try and do in the early part of your trip and perhaps before the DMZ tour.Highly Recommended"
