0,5.0,The temple looks boring from the front. Walk further in towards the back and u will see a kind of little forest or park. The autumn foliage is simply gorgeous and out of this world. this place is an easy 500m walk from Coex Mall so u can easily combine this with a visit to Starfield Library and a meal in Coex Mall.
1,5.0,"since i'm a buddhist, i figured i should come down and take a look, even if you're not, the place is right opposite coex starfield mall - so might as well drop by here. it is situated on a mound, so expect to climb a bit of stairs or walk up the slopes. the buildings and decorations are beautiful, especially the lanterns. just walk around, breathing in the calm scenery around"
2,4.0,Glad to have a chance to revisit this place and looking at those colourful lanterns with wishes hanging onto it. The chance to bath the buddha was also great!The temple seems to be undergoing renovation.A real short walking distance from the subway station which is good choice for the elderly.
3,3.0,"Maybe I'm a bit spoiled by seeing so many of these, but I just wasn't impressed. The architecture is beautiful, yet forgettable. Nothing exceptionally unique here either. Also not impressed with how they fit it all together - that is, with the lack of any general plan, when you feel like it's one complex, and not just a set of separate buildings. Dusty footpaths everywhere instead of filling space with a garden is another problem, which seem to separate Korean temples from what I've seen in Japan. Overall, if you haven't been to a Buddhist temple before or only seen one or two, you may find it worth a visit. Otherwise, it's rather standard, even though still quite beautiful temple, with a moderately large territory to explore."
4,4.0,"Bongeunsa Temple offers a reprieve in the midst of the bustling metro. We planned to only for a few minutes but we ended up staying more than half an hour. Its grounds were well-maintained and it was very peaceful. It sort of reminds me of Nara, Japan. It has several temples and a big Buddha statue. A lantern festival was being held when we went there which made the place extra interesting. A must-visit if you’re in the area!"
5,4.0,Very quiet and peaceful place.  The painting on these building is amazing.  Within walking distance of several hotels.
6,4.0,It’s hard to believe that there is a small quiet temple nestled between tall city buildings. Bongeunsa Temple offered a quiet place to visit. There are prayers held there daily so visitors should be mindful.
7,5.0,"Just opposite COEX shopping mall, this temple is another attraction of it’s own. Take more time to visit all the temple halls and the main attraction is tall Buddha and a open air area surrounded in a forest where devotees meditate and pray."
8,4.0,I reckon it's worth a visit especially if you're around gangnam area. The temple is open for free to all...even to Non-Buddhist. The temple is easy to find and walking distance from Bongeunsa train station. It's known for the tall Buddha statue and nice well kept oldest wooden temple and it's garden. Place is immersed in tranquility...I just loved it.
9,4.0,"If you have plan to visit huge library in COEX Gangnam, please dont forget to visit Bongeunsa Temple in front of east gate COEX. Its nice budhist temple where you can learn about budha religion even you can stay here. There is one big statue knside the temple..."
10,5.0,"The temple is great, you need to spend some time there, the flower decoration is awesome. Buddhism in Seoul."
11,4.0,"We visit the temple on the last day since we have nothing much to do. Very well preserve. But, if you coming around SMTOWN area, then can have a short drop off this place for some nice photo."
12,5.0,"I have visited menu temples and palaces, but this one is one of my favorites places. You don’t walk too much to appreciate all the site.If you want to do something else around, Coex has an aquarium and it is just crossing the stree"
13,5.0,"Over a thousand years old, this temple oozes history and culture. It contains woodblock carvings which resonate with Buddhists. Definitely worth seeing."
14,5.0,"I before was only by transit. This visit is second visit by long time, 2 weeks. I was also second time visit the Bongeunsa temple. This time I excited very beautiful flower..unfortunately I am forget the name."
15,4.0,There are lots of stairs but the end is worth the climb.  The details just amaze me in the designs and the build.  WOW.
16,4.0,"Comparing with Jogyesa temple, I prefer this one because it’s much bigger, more beautiful and has more to see. Unfortunately it is much harder to get to but we were lucky as we were with a tour guide. You can enter the halls and watch or listen to the locals pray but be respectful and be quiet and no taking photos inside. It was enjoyable listening to the monks chant, it was very calming and peaceful."
17,5.0,"You must visit this temple during the lotus lantern festival/Buddha's birthday in the spring! There are hundreds of colorful lanterns strung all around the temple complex and they are incredible! This is my 2nd favorite of the many gorgeous Buddhist temples in Seoul (1st being Jogyesa). It is very welcoming and peaceful. The grounds/buildings are beautifully maintained. It is a fabulous place to go for a stroll, pray or meditate, or take photos. There is also a very tall sculpture of the Buddha on site that is very striking. I highly recommend visiting Bongeunsa."
18,5.0,"The temple complex is a peaceful sanctuary in the middle of an urban jungle in Gangnam, Seoul. A serene place where people can go escaping the hustle and bustle of city life. The artifacts found in this temple in my opinion is a lot better than those inside the Gyeongbokgung Palace. We arrived here in the evening and the monks are doing their evening prayers. It added to the peaceful atmosphere that the place emitted. Definitely a must-see."
19,5.0,"Look out for the hazelnut tree at the entrance of the temple. It was the first time our kids get to see a hazelnut tree and they were so excited. There are also red dates, persimmon and Chinese pear trees in the temple. There is also a magnificent standing Buddha statue beside the main shrine."
20,4.0,"We visited the place for the sake of photography, nice garden, buildings, and friendly ppl we met there."
21,3.0,"This was a beautiful temple, but since it is an active temple it felt a little awkward touring it. We weren't sure where we could and couldn't go, but definitely beautiful."
22,5.0,If you are staying south of the river then it's a must stop.  It's a practicing temple.  You will here monks chanting and people worshiping. It's a big place to explore and soak in.
23,4.0,"The spot is Buddhist temple located in the middle of skyscrapers Gangnam. But this temple is kind of very valuable downtown park suitable for 20-30 min. walk. As long as you wear neat clothes in common sense, you can enter the place (There is no charge for entrance!) You can enjoy some old fashioned Korean Buddhist temple architectures and some quiet moods from religious faculties. They have big statue of Buddha (Maitreya). And all those old fashioned architecture and statue are mostly from modern times within 50yrs from now on. (Though the temple built almost 1,000yrs ago most of original buildings were burnt over fires). So the temple is not the kind of destination you should be, but worth visiting for short break, if you stay near to this temple."
24,5.0,It was amazing to see how Koreans take time to pray at this temple in the middle of the day.  The place was so serene and relaxing.  So many great spots to take photos of too.
25,5.0,I visits the temple after reading various reviews and I didn't regret it. It was the most peaceful spot right in the middle of the city. Don't forget to visit the Big Buddha at the back of the temple overlooking the city. Really tranquil place to visit
26,4.0,"We walked here from CoEx as it's only 5 mins. The temple complex is on the side of a hill, so you get views of the city. A few cherry trees were in bloom which brightened up the surroundings. We were too late for a guided tour but we just enjoyed walking around anyway.Well worth visiting if you come to CoEx."
27,4.0,"A peaceful ancient temple in the midst of busyness. Visited the temple in the late afternoon. Met with colourful lanterns and lotus carvings, as well as the early spring bloom."
28,5.0,There is easy access to the temple through the station with the same name. It is a beautiful temple surrounded by the city. Worth the visit. There is a huge statue of Buddha which can be easily missed as it is at the back.
29,3.0,I was impress with the art of this temple..no entrance fee..we came inside..through labyrinth of lotus see inside the temple and got out..no clue this temple history...
30,4.0,"Beautiful Budhist Temple older than a thousand year, close to Bongeunsa Station ( Subway Line 9 ) Good for Visit"
31,5.0,"We spent an amazing afternoon here with the family.  There are so many things to see that it can take hours to get through everything!  The flowers, lanterns, and multiple smaller temples are worth seeing.  This location is right across from the fun COEX Mall."
32,4.0,You can pay for a tour to the Temple but it's $45 each. Alternative is 45 minutes on a train at a fraction of the cost. Metro is easy ans signs in English help. People at the station and information guides are as helpful.An interesting active temple so remember this as noise and going inside are restricted.
33,5.0,Beautiful and scenery.. Good to quiet one mind with the nice weather and beautiful. Feel so blessed and glad to have a chance to visit this temple.
34,3.0,"A majestic Temple where Buddhism is the main religion back hundreds of years ago. Very big temple where the architectural portion are still very much preserve.  It is located opposite COEX. Korea Line 9, Bongeunsa Station.  Has to maintain peace and quiet in the temple to prevent disturbing Buddhist praying."
35,5.0,"In busy Gangnam it's an oasis of calm. Not overly large it's a nice respite from a bustling city. You can wander around taking care not to disturb people at prayer. If you can plan it, around sunset the monks work the drums and gongs - well worth experiencing. Attraction is free tho' donations are accepted."
36,4.0,"I went to Bongeunsa Temple on May and there was a festival of Buddha. So they held a festival for a few days and so many people came and pray, also they wrote down their wishes in a piece of paper and hung the paper on top. This temple is such a beautiful place in the middle of town. You can see so many tall building around this temple, and it;s just fascinating."
37,5.0,This is a perfect peaceful oasis in the middle of a modern city which is Seoul. The statures were beautiful and a relaxing pond with trickling water. It is an functioning temple so there was a service going on. So no loud picture taking or screaming kids.There is a little coffee shop to get some Korean snacks and drinks with real good coffee just outside entrance.
38,5.0,Beautiful temple buildings with lovely gardens.The big Buddha was awesome.The staff were very friendly asking where we came from.Had some lovely gifts in the shop
39,5.0,The surrounding of the temple was very beautifully decorated.  Full bloomed lotus could be seen at the entrance.  Quite many locals were doing their prayers and the chanting added serenity to the whole place.
40,5.0,"There are extensive renovation works going on right now and the result of the renovation are beautiful, vivid colours on wood. Nice greenery and some special features make it worth a visit."
41,5.0,"Very nice temple and monastery for peaceful reflection!   The view from the top of the hill is quite serene.  The big statue of Buddha, architecture and lotus flowers are beautiful."
42,4.0,This is a very beautiful temple you come come here for prayers and all. Is huge and really a great experience. Is also right across from the Coex building. We came on a very hot day but still manage to enjoy the experience and later went to cool off at Coex.
43,4.0,"If you visit co-ex mall, don't miss this boutique temple. It's small but beautiful. The water lily flowers add the uniqueness of this temple. It's worth visiting it."
44,5.0,After having been looking around in COEX that it is the right spot for a change of mind and same peace. Large Buddha statue in the back.
45,5.0,"We took a cab from Myeongdong to Bongeunsa temple, it was absolutely gorgeous. Beautiful and peaceful temple with full of Lotus in summer, far from our imagination.  Strongly recommend to everyone!"
46,4.0,A very beautiful place to go. Quite calm and restful though close to the COEX and the crowd.  We were charmed by all the lotus flowers and the ancient buildings
47,5.0,It's just beautiful and peaceful especially in the middle of busy Gangnam area. It's opposite COEX mall and not far from subway station. I think it's worth a visit if you are in the area.
48,5.0,"Don't miss it, its in Gangnam, you can take the subway/metro to get there. Plan for at least 1 hour to see the entire property. It's very inspiring."
49,5.0,"Right across the street from COEX.  Beautiful and nicely kept temple.  Nice break from the noisy street.  Around lunch time, lots of office workers bring their lunches and eat in the gardens.  Great place for pictures."
50,4.0,"One of my favourite areas in Seoul. There’s this sense of peace whenever I walk around, and though it’s situated in one of the busier districts in Gangnam (Samsung) and is rather close COEX and some large hotels, it is never really very crowded. The temple is mid-sized and is lovely to walk around in, with really nice scenery and is especially beautiful in winter and spring (and possibly even in autumn). There’s also a temple stay program here and offers a glimpse into the teachings of Korean Buddhism.  Definitely worth a visit, no entry fee is charged."
51,4.0,"This temple compound is a beautiful place to spend an hour enjoying the calm of the buddhist culture. You can climb your way up the hill/steps through and around a variety of old and new buildings. Worshippers often have the doors closed, but you can sneak a peak in a respectful way when the door opens and closes. The trees and plants are gorgeous and make a spring or summer time visit all the better. It's easy to visit the COEX complex (including the aquarium) across the street if you feel the need to re-enter the urban world. The temple is worth a visit for sure."
52,5.0,Peaceful setting and wonderful to hear chanting throughout temple grounds. Beautifully preserved. Lots of smaller temples to pray in. Walking though grounds to see budding Spring flowers was wonderful.
53,4.0,"Very nice temple.  People were friendly.  There was no cost.  Not a big deal, but a great way to spend an your walking around.  some of the areas are not open to the public.  Huge Buddha statue that is great for pictures.  Excellent gift shops.  Definitely worth seeing.  Right across from the COEX (mall, movie theater, restaurants, etc) and Casino so lots to do around the area."
54,5.0,Amazing beauty surrounded by modern buildings and technology. Very nice temple with abundance of history
55,5.0,Visited in winter. Great to see a working to temple. Came with a cranky toddler so couldn't stay as long as we would have liked but great peaceful place. Cafe nice for a stop.
56,5.0,Take a break from the markets and shopping for some peaceful reflection at this wonderful temple across from the coex mall. By far the fewest people we encountered gave us the opportunity to truly absorb the spirit of the place. Lots of different structures built on a hill with very good english signage made for a great afternoon.
57,4.0,"This was the inviting view (and the source of the alluring early morning sound from a Bell Pavilion) across the boulevard from our InterContinental COEX hotel and we explored around the many buildings which were in use for Buddhist prayer and meditation, the immaculate grounds, and the absolute serenity of the hilltop location of the Gwanseum-bosal statue."
58,5.0,It's the temple across the Coex mall which is really convenient. It's very beautiful inside starting from the doorways to the golden Buddhas . If you want to go inside the temples you need to take off your shoes and have to wear socks- you can't be barefooted. They have English tours on Thursdays and offer temple stays too .
59,5.0,This was a great site to visit -- We really enjoyed area and visiting - I would have like more description in English to fully enjoy however was beautiful site
60,5.0,"This temple nest with in Gangnam district, real nice, one of the very few  temple in Seoul. Temples are not within Seoul."
61,1.0,It is free to visit on top of everything. you are free to take pictures and enter the prayers rooms but should keep silent and be careful not to offend the people who are meditating there. a big and beautiful statue of budha is shining on top of a series of temples. you can also have walk inside woods. they offer a stay pachage for those who would like to experience living with monks and grt to know about Buddhism.
62,4.0,If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city come here to check out the peaceful traditional Korean houses- ☺☺ you don't have to pay it's free
63,5.0,"I've heard about ""temple stay"" and about this temple but just during visiting it i know what it's mean . Go there and enjoy , if you are looking for some special !"
64,4.0,Better than the ABC's of touring - another bloody castle. Quiet prayer and beautiful grounds are a nice break for people of any religion.
65,4.0,"We visited during a heavy rainstorm, and so didn't linger as long as I would have liked, but even in the downpour we could tell that this temple was extraordinarily beautiful and serene - despite being in the center of the city. We loved the paper lanterns, colorful painted details, and giant Buddha statue. Priests were chanting and holding ceremonies in several of the buildings we passed, which made it even more interesting and atmospheric. Even though this temple is popular with visitors, it is very much a working temple, and most people we saw were there to pray."
66,5.0,"My family stayed at the Intercontinental Coex and while we explored much of Seoul we liked finding places close by too and the Bongeunsa Temple was almost right across the street.The area covered by this temple is very large with several different buildings. There is a parking lot too but there are beautiful gates, statues, multiple halls, and a pavilion. The most impressive thing, I felt, was the Great Statue of Maitreya Buddha. It had some cool carvings in the side of demon type men creatures and is 23 meters tall. Many of the halls had little paper lanterns hanging from the ceilings, hundreds of them which we found interesting.There are a fair amount of stairs and climbing here, so be aware of that. It is sort of built on the side of a hill so there are elevation differences as you move around the temple site.The place offers opportunities to experience Buddhist practices with overnight stays and 2 hour tours, with associated fees. We did not participate in these. The 2 hour tour takes place every Thursday and includes a tea ceremony which I am told you can still watch even if you aren't part of the tour. The place is clean, serene, and lovely. There is a lot of greenery as your walk between the buildings and has a sense of being in nature, even though it is in the middle of the Gangnam district. It is a nice place to take a break and see some traditional Buddhist buildings and customs."
67,4.0,Many women went up to this temple during the middle of the day. It was interesting to watch them meditate and gather.   Not very many men .  This particular one did not smell like incense to us. It is right across the Coex mall. The Buddha in the back is very tall but not the most astounding  one I have seen In Asia. It was part of our Gangnam tour but I would not pay to go in for $30 per person.
68,5.0,"According to the brochure, this monument is 1200 years old.  Not a Buddhist, but interesting history."
69,5.0,Nice place to go to see Korean history. It was a good place for my 10 year to visit since he has a fascination with history. He had a very enjoyable time and of course us also.
70,3.0,Staff at the entrance helpful and provided a guide written in English. Lots of information boards too inside and nice to explore if you have half an hour to spare
71,4.0,"Beautiful image of Buddha in Korean style, many Korean people went there to pray and pay respect to.  Decoration and architecture are similar to palaces."
72,3.0,"The temple was easy to find. On our way there, we walked on the main road in the freezing cold weather. A better way to get to the temple is to cut across Coex Mall which we did on our return. In that way, you will be protected from the cold if you are travelling in winter. Upon reaching the temple, we were greeted by a few nice ladies and they gave us some papers to write our wishes on and after that we folded them on the strings in front of the temple. When we visited, part of the temple was under renovation but we are free to roam around. We walked around the temple and took some pictures, it was peaceful and quiet there. A good escape from the busy city in Seoul. Before we left the temple, we were given a packet of rice cake by the temple attendants for good luck. It was a huge packet and each of us had a bite. Overall, a pleasant experience for our family."
73,4.0,"I loved this attraction.  Unlike the palaces, the Temple is in use and has a peaceful and meaningful feeling.  The grounds are beautifully landscaped and the views are lovely."
74,4.0,"Historic, tranquil, and beautiful - three words to describe the temple. A sense of calm fell over me as I entered the temple, leaving the hustle and bustle of a city behind. A must visit for weary travelers looking for an oasis to calm the mind. The temple was undergoing some restoration work but still worth a visit."
75,4.0,There are several temples with active services going on.  The Buddha statue and temple artwork was amazing to look at.
76,4.0,Lovely and easy place to get to if you're in the Gangnam area. Quite small but up a hillside so a surprising number of buildings to see. A large Budda statue as well.
77,4.0,"After walking 600 meters from the nearest train station, this temple is a welcome oasis in a busy city.  It has nice gardens, beautiful buildings, a most serene looking giant Buddha.  There is a lot of opportunity to contemplate or mediate, pray and give offerings.  It welcomes everyone.  The architecture is beautiful.  There is a tea shop at the side.   Visitors are welcome to witness or participate.  We also viewed outdoor sculptures on our way to the temple."
78,5.0,"This Buddhist temple is utterly beautiful. Lies in between high skyscrapers, this is the place to go when you need serenity and a breather. It's one of the most beautiful Buddhist temple I've visited and believe me I've visited a lot. The temple architecture are so beautiful and the lanterns found around the ground of the temple add to its amazing-ness. Sorry can't help using the beautiful word so many times. ;)"
79,3.0,"One of the smaller palaces.  Many things to see, but little to do.  It is centrally located and minutes from subway."
80,4.0,"A reasonable sized working Buddhist temple. I hate to say it, but I have seen far more impressive Buddhist temples in Malaysia and India, BUT this one gets four stars for being literally surrounded by giant skyscrappers!"
81,4.0,We took a cab over to the Gundaem area where this temple is across the river from the main part of Seoul.  It is a large temple and on the grounds are smaller temples and lanterns and a giant statue.  We were glad we went to see it as it was larger that Jogyesa Temple
82,5.0,"Despite some seemingly mixed reviews, we found Bongeunsa a really pleasing temple to visit; very calm and peaceful, despite the proximity of a couple of major roads.  Although (as with much else in Seoul) not much was truly original, the renovations (old and modern) have been done well and it had real spirit of place and many people coming to pray and make offerings.  Actually, ""temple complex"" is more like it, as it spreads out across the hillside, with a number of buildings and the standing Buddah statue that makes it into all the photos. Given the location, close to Gangnam, makes it an easy visit; we walked up from Samseong station, less than 10mins past COEX to the next major road and then across and to the left.  Ironically for us, the ATM at the entrance was useful, as we were running a bit low on won by that point. A definite place to visit if you are in Seoul."
83,5.0,Really beautifully maintained with a ton of amazing history.  This castle was once destroyed after a time of war and unrest (occupancy by foreigners).  later the Korean government restored it to its former glory.  I am told there is still a lot of restoration to be done but what you see is amazing!  The changing of the guards is a fun thing to watch as well.  Our kids had a blast!  they loved it more than the Forbidden City in China!
84,4.0,"Situated in COEX area, opposite to COEX. Very good. The statue of Buddha is very impressive. Also have the temple stay programme.  Good vegetarian food. When we visited the Cherry blossom was happening. Riot of colors. Not to miss this temple."
85,4.0,We appreciate the guided tour conducted by the volunteer in the temple. We have a better understanding of the temple's structure and history. The Buddha statue is magnificent. Photography inside the temple is prohibited but I am happy with my shots around it.
86,5.0,This is a wonderful Buddhist temple just outside Gangnam and nearby the bustling Coex. It is very serene and a great contrast to the crowds and noise of Seoul. It is historically very significant and a joy to walk through and experience.
87,5.0,"Before you leave stop at the visitors desk. Its in an office towards the back they are unbelievably helpful and can recommend things to do there for children, temple stays, and other things you might have missed."
88,5.0,"A piece out of time, out of noise but still in center of a huge city. This represent the opportunity to feel a special moment surrounded by the chaos a very big city."
89,5.0,"We had  a little time left before going to catch our flight out, and since we went to do the early check in at the airport bus depot in Gangnam, we were conveniently close to the temple. Highly recommend that early check in in Gangnam, btw. Very convenient.  We walked to the temple after dropping all our luggage and carry on off.  The temple is right across the street from COEX. If you've seen the K-drama ""Faith"" then you will recognize Bongeunsa as the temple used in the show. The temple grounds is much larger than Jogyesa. There are lots of little separate pavilions. Also that huge standing white Buddha statue at the top of the hill. All the lanterns hung around the grounds also create a very serene and peaceful atmosphere. If you happen to be in Gangnam, don't miss this temple."
90,5.0,The architecture of the temple was beautiful. The temple is located directly opposite Intercontinental Seoul Coex so it is worth visiting the temple if you are staying at the hotel or you are in the area.
91,5.0,"This was a great experience.  Right in the middle of Seoul is this little oasis.  There are several temples on the grounds.  To look around is free, though they do have a donation box at the entrance.  The staff was very friendly.  We tried very hard to stay out of everyone's way, as there was ceremonies going on in almost all off the temples while we were there."
92,5.0,A lovely Oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Seoul. Could spend an entire day there just chilling out
93,5.0,We had the good fortune of traveling to Korea during the Lantern Festival which is a celebration of Buddha's birthday so the temple was busy with activities and beautifully decorated with thousands of lanterns. The grounds are huge and a bit hilly but the uphill climb is worth it!
94,3.0,We went during the period of their Lotus Lantern Festival in mid-May. Tons of colourful lanterns are displayed all around the temples which gives this peaceful praying grounds a dash of liveness.Drop by if u are in the area as there is another temple Bongeunsa that gives a similar vibes which I personally preferred much to this.
