0,5.0,A great place to spend time with your kids whom will love the adventure and thrilling of rides everywhere. It is similar to Disney Land & combination of Universal Studio but only Korean Style. Many amusement park indoor and outdoor were pack with teenagers and even children‚Äôs in all walks of age. Lovely to see explore and have fun to feel how it is it to be like kid again. üíïüíïüíï

3,4.0,"We got our tickets online with a magic pass 5 options. Basically you can choose 5 rides and cut the queues without having to book the timing like the magic pass on the main website. The entrance tickets are also discounted on the third party website. Apparently it is a promotion only for foreigners. So you have to bring your passport.The park itself was great fun. There were lots of rides for all thrill levels both indoors and outdoors. Atlantis, Gyro Drop, and French Revolution, were some of the more thrilling rides I remember riding. Definitely worth using the pass for. If you visiting with young kids I did see there were some rides that were only for young kids. The park really caters to all ages. For the Instagram mets there was also an area inside near the VR attractions for taking selfies. The selfie studio is set up with sets and props as well as tripods for rent. We loved taking pictures with the various backdrops.We happened to be there for Halloween, so there was also costume rentals and face painting (extra costs) near the entrance. There was even a haunted house set up. Not to forget the Halloween parade. We saw that they even has some of the park guests who were dressed as princesses participate. Lots of food affordable food available as well. Food stalls as well as set restaurants and food courts were available all over the park. There seems to have been no issues about bringing your own too. We brought in our own water.When it was time to go we exited into the Mall and we glad to find that there was a Lotte Mart around the corner of the exit. So manage to squeeze in a little grocery shopping before having to head back.Overall I felt it was a fun place to visit for the whole family."
4,4.0,"Lotte world is a nice amusement park right in the city. There is a indoor section and an outdoor section so even on rainy days and in winter you can still go and have a good time. There are plenty of places to eat and drink in the park. The inside part has balloon shape cars that go around the ceiling and a wild indoor rollercoaster.  There is a stage that has performances several times a day. Between the park and the metro station there is a big shopping mall. So you could go the park, go shopping, eat and never have to go outside. Great for those cold rainy days."
5,5.0,"There is an indoor and outdoor amusement park with lots of rides, including trill rides. The VR rides are really good. Plan to spend the whole day there as half a day is not enough."
6,5.0,"Still halfway through the day but this adventure land is paradise for the children. Recommended for families. Awesome 3D VR experiences. Bigger indoor than expected. Still yet to find the outdoor segment. Floors aplenty of amusement games, food stalls and activities."
7,5.0,It‚Äôs a beautiful shopping üõç mall and very big too but little far from the center of Seoul many good restaurants and shop !! Good for family with children too !! Best way to get here by taxi üöñ
8,1.0,I'm writing this while still in the queue for our second ride. We have been here for 4 and a half hours now. I was afraid it could be crowded so we went on a Monday and I bought a 5x Magicpass which i could not use a single time because all seats have been booked out almost immediately for all attractions which are popular.I think its only worth a visit if you are totally into waiting or if you come with children because the attractions for small children seem to have less waiting times.
9,4.0,"This is a whole world of entertainment. Outside park, inside entertainment, food hall and shopping ,shopping ,shopping. It was amazing to watch the people having fun and enjoying all the possibilities to be entertained. For us it was a little bit to loud. We are not used to that common notices!However what a fine location to enjoy life!"
10,4.0,"My husband and I went to Lotte World for a day date! We had so much fun! The lines can get very long (like all amusement parks); however, the rides were fun and well kept!"
11,2.0,"We went there on a Monday, in the morning. But the amount of people queuing was unbelievable. The waiting time was at least one hour, up to 3hours. The most popular rides have longer waiting time, ofc. During 6 hours spend there we took 3 rides total. You can buy a magic pass, but that costs extra 100k and you can‚Äôt use it on all rides. And let‚Äôs be honest, 50$ for the regular ticket is not so cheap. Also, you have to pay extra for some of the rides/attractions. To sum up, I don‚Äôt recommend it neither will I go there again."
12,2.0,"Ok, we were here on a Saturday night which is probably not ideal as it is very busy. The rides are mainly for little kids, so, nothing too exciting for adults. We wanted to go on the hot air balloon ride but the queue was 2 hrs. We queued for about 1/2hr for the monorail ride but because it‚Äôs winter, half of the ride route was cancelled, so, it was a very short one. Some nice photo ops outside at the Disney looking castle, so, make sure you go out of the building & walk around a bit. We were lucky that there was a Christmas parade - this was the highlight of this visit."
13,4.0,"Very strange place, but a fun time had overall. Initially when entering the park, the place seems very small. All of the big attractions aren't immediately visible. Take a few minutes to locate all of the major rides/attractions inside and outside of the park. Some of the lines can be very long, but hey, most theme parks are. The indoor section looks very dated and there aren't as many spectacular rides. Roller coasters are a blast. Lots of food options too! There is enough to see for an entire day so plan ahead. Not a bad option for a day at a theme park."
14,5.0,Reminiscing back our childhood days at this place. Was so fantastic that you would say to yourself its nice to be a kid again.
15,4.0,"Sweet little theme park that is not overblown. Good for kids, big kids and adults who are kids inside. Great way to enjoy a day.Lotte World theme park is not overly crowded. Most rides will require about 30-50mins++ to line up for. Indoor activities are quite numerous but are aimed at younger audiences. Be warned, some 4D rides can get you very dizzy. Outside is fun but can get colder at night. No extreme thrill rides such as a crazy roller coaster and some rides are notin operation. App/Web is not updated about status.They have some theme (halloween) but arent as committed as other parks. Lotte mascots are not as relatable to foreigners."
16,4.0,"We had a spare day during a recent tour of Korea so decided to spend it at lotte world. Got some tickets online (with a massive discount) the night before, collection was easy. Was pretty amazed by the spectacle of the whole site really, rides are designed for kids rather than adults but we found the outside ones a but more adult. Very much enjoyed our day but it was very busy with long lines for all rides. Food and drink was farely priced considering it is a theme park. Is it a must see thing in Seoul, maybe not buy none the less we did have a great day."
17,4.0,"i rally wanted to go to lotte world when i was in Seoul and when i did i didn't regret it, it was magical and fun. it was very busy but it was near Christmas so it was expected and i did go on a weekend there were very long lines for rides and we only managed to go on 3, but they were well worth the wait.the food was really yummy we had some of the food off the stands and went to the Korean restaurant in the magical kingdom are both were really delicious. beacuse the rides were so busy we decided to go and do all of the 3D rides which were so much fun!  there we 4 or 5 i think they were only 5/10 minutes or so long but so good!overall i would recommend people to go to lotte world just not on the weekend or at peak times!"
18,3.0,Lotte world is good for Kids at heart .. Still fun but if you been to universal or disneyland you will be disappointed..Good thing with Lotte world though is mall is just right there too with a bunch of places to shop for .. But entrace is quite expensive if you buy there in the spot find some cheap ticket online..Food wise its good theres various selection.Jamsil station is right there as well and they have lockers on the train station ..
19,4.0,"Besides waiting 2.5 hours in a line up for a roller coaster wearing virtual reality goggles, the first thing we did getting off the ride was get back in line for a further 3 hours to do it again. It was a memorable time but allow yourself a full day."
20,5.0,"I read couple reviews before going and I kept asking myself what would people do there for so many hours. I know now, after leaving when 11th hour passed.This spot just keeps throwing fun at you and it won't stop.Ticket price is about 50k won per adult, but what you get inside makes up for the price."
21,4.0,"Admittedly, I'm not sure if we got lucky or whatever, but it was a Tuesday. There were kids on their field trip there but despite that? there were no lines. Majority of it is indoors with a train that goes around the indoor area and around the outdoor area, too. That said? it was rather fun, and this coming from a guy that doesn't particularly enjoy  theme parks. Just be aware that the B3 entertainments with the VR and ice skating? know that those do NOT come with your entrance, so don't be surprised if you need to pay extra for those."
22,5.0,Lotte's department stores are incredible with up to 17 floors of every type of merchandise you could wish for. It is not only a store but a real experience with marvellous facilities for keeping families amused whilst bargain hunting. British department stores could really benefit from seeing how these work
23,5.0,"I have been to many theme parks around the world, but i had a lot of fun in Lotte World, even though the rides are not extreme at all. Its just a fun place in general and something different to do when you are not busy doing all the cultural activities. We ended up going after 4pm to take advantage of the cheaper tickets as we didn't think we needed a whole day anyway. We spent around 5 hours here during a weekday and we managed to visit all the main rides (although one or two rides were out of service). The only problem we had was that we enjoyed trying to cram in as many rides as possible, that by the time we finished up, we realised the park was closing and all food and snack shops were closing up. You wont need more than 5 hours here in this park and its very easy to reach by MRT. And also, just take note, around 8pm there is a parade that happens inside which is quite cool, but it means a lot of the rides will close down for the duration of this 20-30 minute parade."
24,2.0,"Had time to kill. Lots of young kids, good for them. Queues were long (on a week day) and rides maintained but need updates."
25,5.0,"We were here for a day and there is so much to do!  We were in the area mostly to see the Cherryblossom Festival so it was a convenient place to park. The amusement park looks awesome but we didn‚Äôt go inside. The lake next to the mall is beautiful and it was a great walk going around both sides. It is lined with cherry blossom trees this time of year, and my wife was in heaven.  The mall has a lot of high-end stores and was interesting to visit, but we were there for the restaurants and shops in the lower levels after the walk around the lake. Definitely recommend if you are visiting Seoul."
26,5.0,Fantastic quality and service excellent food and great staff at super modern complex with indoor and outdoor options!
27,2.0,"I had heard that Lotte World is one of the busiest amusement parks in the world (apart from Disney and Universal Studios parks). So we decided to visit it.  Honestly, it's not a good amusement park. I would advise people to not go. I have not been to Everland, but surely it can't be worse. The only reason I can think that Lotte World is busy is that it is in the city centre area beside 3 or 4 big shopping malls, so I guess people who are around find it convenient to visit. But I can't imagine anyone going for more than 1 visit. And I don't recommend that anyone visit it even once.The indoor part of Lotte World feels like a bunch of mediocre amusement park rides have been shoved into a shopping mall on 3-4 floors. Making matters worse, there is a bit of a bad smell around the space. We went on a few rides in the indoor part (a dinosaur shooting one and a flight simulator one) - they were somewhat copies of Disneyland rides, but not even 1/4 as good. The outside area of Lotte World was not very big, connected via a bridge over the highway. There is a castle in the middle (copy of disneyland), and the main ""thrill"" rides seemed to be the rides that either go from side to side (like a ricking ship ride) or that spin. We didn't go in tot the haunted house as I read a review to avoid it. We went on a Monday and the wait for those average-looking ""thrill"" rides was 40 minutes. Those rides remind me of old-stlye travelling amusement parks that go to various cities with basic rides. Really there is not much more than that, from what we could see, at Lotte World.It was a real letdown. We left very early."
28,4.0,Went there during rainy day.spend more time inside then outdoor.the 3D movie rides are not good..too childish n non exciting.some rides need to pay eg haunted house..not included in ticket price..love the hot air balloon ride..the outdoor rides cater more to the adventurous adults.the performance was cancelled due to rain and most rides closed as well..but can really spent whole day here.location is very good.directly outside subway station.love the korean cultural museum most.
29,2.0,"If you're planning to go to Lotte World, i suggest you not unless you're going for the kids ride only! This place is suuuuper crowded even on a Monday! So crowded and most rides would cost you minimum 1 hour to 2 hours max waiting in queue!I went there around 10am+ and i was only able to play 1 ride and that 1 ride had me waited 2 hours in queue. Yes it was a fun ride but will i go for another ride and wait for hours? Hell no!And the Magic Pass app is a useless app, can't reserve any rides at all! Wasted my hald day there."
30,3.0,"As a 'foreigner', you can get very cheap tickets from Trip Advisor, Klook, etc. We got some from Govoyagin for 28,000. The problem we found was that it didn't include the three Magic Passes which enables you to skip the queue using either an app or the vending machine outside the ride. Going on Lunar New Year Eve, it was particularly crowded and most of our time was spent in queues. There was even a hot air balloon ride inside (much like a Ferris wheel, really) which had a queue of 100 mins!!! In sum, it was interesting, cute, had some cool VR rides (did the three 'Wild' ones), but it was an exhausting day. PS. Skip the haunted mansion... Wasn't worth the extra 6,000 won."
31,5.0,"Really this place is totally unexpected. Right off a subway station you get a mall, amusement park, skating rink with a shooting range in the basement. It's so many things in one small space and the execution is good! When I first heard about it I thought it would be childish or cheap feeling. I was so wrong. The amusement park is better than some I've been to in North America. What a great place to have a date!"
32,4.0,"Used to visit the park a few times as a child and then as a teen, enjoyed it a lot. Of course, Lotte offers high-quality entertainment, but now the park is too crowded and you have to wait for 40-60 minutes to get on a popular ride. Tickets became too expensive recently, btw. Well worth for the first time visit or for families with children. I was also really pissed off at Lotte corp. for clothing Lotte mart at Jamsil station. It was the only place to buy some Korean food and snacks to bring home."
33,1.0,Too Long queueing - not worthy for coupleOne day pass not worth it.During winters out door park are closed
34,5.0,"After we pre-booked our tickets our I worried myself a bit after reading some poor reviews but we had lots of fun! Lots of teens/children but we are both in our late 20s and still had a great day. Don't spend money on the mini zoo (the animals are so poorly looked after) and be aware that some things will cost extra. We arrived early on a wet, overcast day which seemed to help as we had little to no wait time on most rides. As the day went on we could see wait times were massively increasing so would strongly recommend going early. Check out the folk museum and don't forget to get a park map as many rides are upstairs, downstairs or outside"
35,4.0,"It's one of the most interesting amusement parks of S. Korea and conveniently accessible, as far as it's located inside the city.However it is really overcrowded!!In order to enjoy your time there and to avoid wasting the most of your time, waiting on long ques, try to avoid -if possible- weekends and holidays!On the other hand, using the fast-pass can save some waiting time, but it's availability is very restricted."
36,1.0,"Such a disappointing park. If everland is a stripped down version of disneyland, this is a stripped down version of everland in a shopping mall.If you have to choose between everland and lotte world, dont choose here."
37,4.0,"The big draw for this place in Korea is that it is partially indoors. There is a very expensive shooting range here, too. The lines for the rides are usually really long..."
38,1.0,"I understand there are queues on theme parks, but I have never seen anything like these 2+ hour queues. Managed to get to 3 rides but none are the popular ones. mainly outdoor where is was sun baking us. it was extremely crowded when we went and staff were not helpful trying to manage the population."
39,4.0,We didn‚Äôt go inside the Lotte World. Anyway there is a beautiful lake walk around. You can admire the world‚Äôs 5 highest building from different angles and even go into the top at extra cost.
40,4.0,Very popular with local people. Connected with Lotte hotel and shopping complex. Can easily spend a day in this area.
41,3.0,"We are not huge Disneyland people, but this was a fun adventure.  More of a kid and teen activity, but ok for adults.  Pretty pricey, about $30US/person, but if you're into rides and games, it's fun, especially at night.  They even have an ""Electric Light Parade""  just like Disney!"
42,3.0,"First off, this is nothing on the scale of Disney, which it seems to want to replicate (Magic Island in place of Magic Kingdom, marching bands and cute characters wandering about for photos). The park is good, but perhaps a little pricey for what it is. The rides are on the same scale as say Legoland. Don't expect anything that will leave you wanting to ride again. There are some food outlets which vary in quality. The high points are the water log ride, the Zombie VR area and the Korean Heritage area. There is a huge shopping mall attached which should suit every need. Annoyingly you would need a more expensive day pass to be able to enter the park, then leave to go shopping, then re-enter later on, even though it's all the same Lotte complex. As the title says, this is definitely not a must see place (I only went on my second visit to Seoul) but if you have a spare day on your itinerary and you like theme parks then perhaps this would be a good idea. Try and find a discount coupon as a foreigner you'll get 20% off for up to 4 adults!"
43,5.0,"We booked a ticket on the internet and saved a good amount. The theme park is absolutely amazing. Rides are a combination of adrenaline and smooth. The overall park is a Disney style theme, a must for families.I didn't think the park looked ""old"" at all. Very well organised and definitely value for money. You will have a very good time. This is coming from someone who has three world class theme parks in their city."
44,1.0,"We visited the Lotte World amusement park expecting a ""Disney-like"" experience. The park is expensive and underwhelming."
45,4.0,"So here's the facts you need to consider:Best to go during the week whereby you can purchase tickets at a lower cost.Next. Arrive as close to opening time as you can to ensure short lines.If not happy about long lines, purchase a Magic Pass (a fair bit more expensive) that takes you to the front of the queue. Note that once queue's build up substantially - which they do - many of the rides close the expensive Magic Pass. In other words, get there the earlier the better.Weekends are terribly busy meaning long lines.Lotte World truly caters for all ages (not necessarily those over 65 who Lotte World believe are too old to go on some of the rides!) with a myriad of toddler, child and adult rides.Now to what really upsets me: You'd think that the entry fee would cover everything (aside from food etc of course). Well, it doesn't. Indeed, there are many areas requiring you to spend extra! Take the Ice Rink for example; it is completely autonomous to the adventure park, even though it is right in the middle of it.You can have a great day at Lotte. It really comes down to what you make of it."
46,4.0,"I recently attended Lotte World, and was impressed with the variety of rides on offer.  All ages would enjoy this amusement park, as it caters to those who like placid activities as well as adrenaline junkies.Unfortunately, we went at the start of August, when Korean holidays were on.  Accordingly, the lines for most of the rides were very long.  For example, I waited over an hour to ride the French Revolution. Surprisingly, one of the best things about this theme park was the Italian Restaurant.  The Margherita Pizza (albeit expensive) was, quote possibly, the best pizza I have ever had in my life!I would definitely come again, but only if it was outside the busy period of school holidays and weekends."
47,4.0,"If you like amusement park, this place can be a good option. I've been here three times. On the weekend, it is super busy. Lines will be so long. The longest time I waited in the line was 2 hours."
48,5.0,"We just came to window shop and my wife checked all the designers store. All the beauty products under the sun is here, plus more. Duty free shopping is also available here, very convenient for foreigners to shop. The food section is unbelievable, anything you want is available both local and imported items. The quality and availability of food items in this market surpassed the US supermarkets."
49,4.0,"Don't expect a Disneyland kind of experience but with the right mindset this can be a fun place. Don't pay full price, there a discount coupons all over Seoul and if you visit after 4pm you pay a reduced price, combined with a discount coupon the entrance fee is reduced by almost 50%. The place is open till 10pm so you have lots of time to explore. Most of the rides is standard carnival stuff but they also have a couple of rides which are brave attempts to copy Disney. They do not succeed but it is all very charming and we laughed about it. Staff is for the most part friendly. Stay till 8pm for the excellent light parade!!"
50,3.0,1 hour from central. this indoor & outdoor park is big. with many rides. whether you visit in weekend or weekdays it is extremely over crowded with locals. you have to wait 30-60 minutes for most of the rides. we have spent 5-6 hours and hardly enjoyed 7-8 rides. we have spent whole day standing from one queue to another.You have to pay money for many rides. and many rides are boring and mostly for kids. so not worth standing in queue for long time. few restaurants inside.
51,5.0,great experience in Lotte World Adventure and Aquarium! one of the most memorable trip of my life! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
52,2.0,"Shops and stalls all selling the same thing its outrageously tedious and time wasting , improve you life and give it a miss."
53,2.0,Im quite disappointed with lotte world. If you are two adults thinking where to go between lotte world and everland I think everland would be better. The lines are insane and its very hot inside I'm not sure if they have an air conditioning or its an outdoor with roof. üôä  but if you really want to go there I suggest that you go after 7pm the ticket prices is much lower and its enough to go around the area and the lines are a bit fast by that time.
54,1.0,"If I could give it minus one star I would. Wait for rides are massive, 140 minutes at 2pm in school time for one of the less popular rides. Over-priced, over-crowded - left me feeling underwhelmed and under appreciated as a paying customer. Would rather have paid best part of 40 pounds for someone to slap me in the face with a wet fish. At least cost wise‚Äã it would have been better value than this complete rip off. Don't bother with the App to reserve rides - doesn't work. Hardly a surprise..."
55,4.0,"Not as many exillerating rides as many of the outside parks have to offer and we experienced really long lines, however it is very much worth a visit and we had a blast. A rollercoater ride inside is pretty hair raising. Try find foreigner discount days if you're a visitor, it can make a big difference price wise."
56,1.0,Too many peopleNo opportunityNo management. Even..at least. you should wait for 100min to enter the Ghost House.Here will be the worst experience of yours.
57,2.0,"If you want to visit a crowded department store to spend thousands of dollars on over priced designer labels, go for it. I walked through as a curiosity to see what kind of person would pay enormous amounts of money for clothes and accessories made in China but stamped with some designer name. I can afford it but would never spend thousands on a purse or shirt."
58,4.0,"We went to Lotte World on our last day of our holiday. Due to the rainy weather we were stayed at the indoor theme park. This is great for all ages, especially for family's. We took the subway to get to Lotte World."
59,3.0,"I had fun with my friends here. The lines were much too long, and my friends didn't know what they were doing, but it was still really cool being here. The food is crazy expensive. We had to search for forever to find the one ice cream shop that was more reasonably priced because it was EXTREMELY hot seeing that it was summer. It's half inside and half outside so that part was super cool. It was my first time seeing an amusement park inside. We ended up finding the ice cream shop. Since it's half inside you could go on a rainy day, but I would suggest going when you can enjoy both parts of the park. There are many rides that are copies of Disneyland so I would compare it to that. Not very thrilling, but everything was very cute. Couples everywhere. Must-go-to if you love amusement parks. We ate at the Lotteria outside before going into the park."
60,4.0,"West Edmonton Mall eat your heart out, give or take 800 shops and a kids entertainment centre. They have a shop for anything you can think of! If you love shopping, this is a must see!"
61,4.0,"Outdoor attractions was thrilling, by the looks of it (we only rode one because we felt a bit old and our hearts couldn't take the rides, haha). On the inside there was an ice rink in the middle and VR attractions were everywhere, the quality was amazing. We spent most of our time inside the Fold Museum because we went to do pottery painting and at the same time, learnt a bit about their culture."
62,4.0,We spotted this while roaming around the Lotte shopping area. Though it was 4pm but we decided to go in and explore this indoor and outdoor adventure park. We even got a discount as they offer discounts after 4pm on the day Pass.  There was a waiting of almost 30-45 mins on all the popular rides but it was worth waiting in the queue. We loved the V. R roller coaster and air balloon ride.  If you have the patience of waiting for 45 mins per ride then its definitely worth buying a day pass to spend a few hours in th evening. Outdoor theme park is also beautiful with lots of rides and amazing view of cherry blossom in the spring season.
63,4.0,"I've been to Lotte World many times and I have to say I am never tired of going here. Its fun, cheap (with coupons), and has pretty cool rides. The only downside is that no matter when you go there will always be a line. Even if you go on a school day you will see students in their uniform skipping. Expect to stay the whole day here. They also have themed parades and shows that are pretty cool"
64,3.0,"We went on a weekend. Overcrowded with people and queue ranging up to 30mins for rides.They have an outdoor and indoor theme park. Indoor rides are less exciting. Outdoor rides are heart-pumping.There are restaurants and cafes, as well as souvenirs shops in the theme park.This theme park is more for kids and young people. Not suitable for middle-aged and above."
65,2.0,"This indoor theme park would probably be really enjoyable for children under 10 and their parents. As two adults, we found majority of the rides quite tame. The rides that looked like they would be more appropriate for us had massive queues of over 2 hours (on a weekday) and the magic passes had all been used. We used the discount coupon from the airport bus ticket but it still was an expensive day due to the limited appropriate rides."
66,5.0,A very nice attraction specially for kids and kids at heart who wants to enjoy a modern carnival-like atmosphere. Consists of many fun and exciting rides for all types of ages.
67,3.0,"Good Attraction, but you need to rethink about your trip plan!!This is my 2nd time visiting Lotte World, bought the discount ticket (30% off) from Trip Maker through my guesthouse, and I went there on Saturday and omg that was a disaster!!!! Arrived there at 11am and left at 8pm (7 hours), I have spent almost 4 - 5 hours ONLY lining up and looked at my phone :(No doubt the rides and everythings are cool and entertaining in the Lotte World, both indoor and outdoor, but there are sooooo many people; For the most famous rides like Gyro Spin and Atlantis, I have spent 45 mins queuing for each lel.I don't think I need to describe how fun it is in the theme park since they are more or less the same seriously... yeah Lotte World makes you feel joyful and excited when you step in the indoor park, but for real, when you get closer to the ride and once you spot the end of the queue, and start lining up, and wait for 15 mins, and wait for 30 mins, still a long way to go, I am sure you will get mad. (I was with my boyfriend and we were getting more tired and even stopped talking...)I strongly suggest my fellow travellers, try to avoid visit Lotte World on Friday/Saturday/Sunday!!!!!My first visit to Lotte World back in 2014, I paid full-price and only spent 4 hours there becasue I was so fed up with the queuing. Thought it would be better for my re-visit after 2 years, still the same..smh"
68,3.0,This place is best for kids and kids at heart.Typical amusement park with korean taste.Not the best but ok.
69,2.0,"We came here early, just after it opened and there was already ques for 60min(there are signs which tell you approx waiting time). So we though we would go on a few other rides and the ques would get shorter. Big mistake. by lunchtime there were lines for 120min, then a few hours later they reached 170min. You cant leave the park once you are in, and the lunch area was so busy that we had trouble finding a seat, and it was just the two of us. Can't imagine bringing a family with kids. We ended up waiting in some lines, and did enjoy the rides we did go on. I wouldn't recomend though"
70,3.0,"Conveniently situated near Jamsil Station, it has both indoor and outdoor theme park. The queues were quite long and you will need to queue more than an hour for popular rides. The Cinderella performance for Christmas season was fantastic; beautiful costumes and dance routines. There is plenty of shopping choices and restaurants right outside the theme park as well.If you are not a fan of rides and do not have patience for queuing, then I suggest you give this place a miss."
71,2.0,"This place really is incredible to view. The design and overall appearance of the precinct is nearly breathtaking. It is a shame however that unless you're willing to stand in lines of at least an hour, you can't really do much. Any of the attractions that are really worth going on are minimum hour sometimes significantly more. The locals didn't seem to mind and perhaps that's a cultural thing but lining up for an hour then having a five minute ride, only to line up for another hour wore thin very quickly. I could only imagine it with a couple of kids (although again, no local kids seemed to mind from what I could tell!). Steep entry fee but it probably is worth a look just to actually view the place."
72,4.0,If you have kids go there you will have fun with them. If you want to get 20% discount use MasterCard to get the tickets at the door.
73,3.0,"The theme park is big, but is not attractive enough for adult to come for second time.  And sometime need to queue long...."
74,5.0,About:Lotte World is divided into an indoor Adventure theme and a Magic Island theme outdoors next to Seokchonhosu Lake.Magic Island is where the prominent dazzling Magic Castle is located also the venue of exhilarating different rides.Tips:When visiting Magical Island during winter remember it gets very cold as surrounded by lake so gear up.There are different tickets prices and if you buy cheap one; the admission one that will not get u any free rides remember.Best to buy day pass.Other tickets are cheap that is from 4pm to 7pm or the 7pm to 10 pm one but in winter it gets dark pretty soon and gets very cold especially during night so u will not be able to enjoy. Better to buy day ticket n visit during day and if want can use at night time too.The day pass is 52000 Won and After 4pm is 41000 Won. The General Admission after 7pm is 18000 Won.
75,5.0,"a lot of funs here... suitable for all family, couples and all age ranges.will visit again!! love it"
76,1.0,This place was disappointing. The collection is not great and the prices were very high. I have not enjoyed this place.
77,4.0,"Directly connected to Jamsil station. Theme Parks, underground shopping & Lotte Mall are all interlink. There are lots of shops on the way to the park entrance.  The One day ticket price at 52,000 Won is a bit expensive. There is a Master Card Promotion of 20% discount, but unfortunately we only have Visa.The theme park is consists of Indoor & the outdoor - Magic Island.   The Indoor theme park have many attractions suitable for children, but most require height limit of 110cm & the friendly staffs actually carried around a stick with height limit! We tried the Balloon ride, Pharaoh Fury, Wild Jungle & Wild valley which are average.If you are a theme park fan, the outdoor rides are much more exciting! We tried the Comet Express which is pretty fun & exciting & not scary. There was a long queue on popular rides such as Gyro Spin, Gyro Swing, Bungee, the Atlantis. Some of the queue last as long as almost an hour & we went there on Monday.  Though you can use Magic Pass to reserve ride & skip the queue, you can only use it once in 2 hrs. Hence, it is better to come on Weekday."
78,4.0,"There are tons of tourists. The amusement park has many photogenic places.Good for families, couples...etcDuring winter/ weekdays, I think some of the attractions are shut down due to weather and maintenance. So I could not enjoy many of the famous attractions there.If the weather is too cold/hot there is an indoor place where you can enjoy attractions under cool environment.Lotte mall and other places right beside lotte world are worth visiting.Tons of shops and restaurants around."
79,3.0,"This theme park is in operation for many years, the facilities cannot serve the increasing demands. All the facilities are full of goers queuing up. Some facilities have to wait for over 2 hours but only play for 5 minutes. It's surely not worth to spend lot of time in waiting and waiting. I strongly hope the park manangemrnt should plan to redevelop the park to cater for the high demands."
80,5.0,"I really enjoyed the indoor inspire theme of this attraction considering we traveled during summer. Although it was crowded during that time because of the school breaks, i enjoyed their facilities and was glad i got to visit stairway to heavens set location!"
81,5.0,"For us ex-pats, this was a great place to enjoy many things besides shopping. Great first run movie theater, great restaurants (American and other international offerings)."
82,3.0,"My husband and I spent a rainy evening at the inside portion of Lotte World. We don't have kids, but still had a pretty good time. While we were there, it was more adults than children there. Overall it was an interesting experience. The little arcade is fun, and they have some tame rides that are also fun. I wouldn't spend an entire day there, but it's a nice experience for a few hours on a rainy day."
83,4.0,"You will be able ton find in the place a (mini) Theme Park (like Disney), a department store and an indoor ice-skating rink!"
84,4.0,Although it's mainly for kids but the rides were quite thrilling. It's an nice experience and I enjoyed my day there.
85,4.0,"So we decided after venturing to the Aquarium to try out the adventure world. it is definately a place where everyone goes. its in the place to be. Warning the weekends best to avoid, think all locals come down for a great time and its a great time but be prepared for the very long queues but you can purchase a Maxi pass thats like a jump the queue"
86,4.0,"It is a wonderful entertaining theme park for family especially for those with children.  It is really much better than those outdoor theme park in summer time.  However, it is very crowded during weekend.  Suggest come here during weekday.  Then, you will have more time to enjoy all the games."
87,4.0,"Had fun there using the magic pass which is a must, too bad I only had two. We really enjoyed the folk museum. It was great to see Korea historically and to learn about the country. Due to the time we went, we didn't get a chance to see the outside nevertheless it was great as an overall. I would definitely go again."
88,4.0,"Lotte World was spectacular. The park was awesome, alot to do and see. All kinds of cafes, restaurants and shops. We went on a weekday, but still the waiting times for the rides were not less than 1 hour. Even 2 hours on the more popular ones.We were there after 4 pm, so 10 000 won cheaper for the tickets. And by paying with mastercard, we got 20% off."
89,5.0,"My husband and I have had such a blast and have enjoyed Lotte World twice now in our 2.5 years in Korea. They offer different pricing depending on the length of stay:all day, after 4, after 7 so there are some choices available. There is an outdoor and indoor section to the park. As a foreigner there are ways to get discounts so it is best to do some research for available offers. The lines can get pretty long, but this is a universal truth. The best time to go though is during Chuseok or Seollal, as these holidays offer discounts for foreigners usually and offer the least crowds (these are family holidays and most people leave town). Also, most rides are actually not in plain sight so the park is much much bigger than it looks!! Use the map so you don't miss anything, like their underground roller coaster located on Magic Island (the outdoor section)."
90,5.0,I don't really expect it will be this big. You will ask to download the application and you can reserve any rides for free! You can reserve only 3 rides so use it wisely. The coupon discount also in the phone application. There is a parade. Your kids can be part of parade but I m not sure how. There is an ice skate as well. Some rides are for kids and some are really scary ( outside). I recommend to go during weekdays and in the morning to avoid people. You can spend the whole day there. It s do easy to get there by train. My favourite ride is bumper car and 4d movie.
91,5.0,Nice Place. Very big building. I have never been to an adventurious place like this before. Our hotel is near. So i everyday come here!
92,4.0,"Nice modern mall. Not many choices of restaurants. There's an indoor theme park good for those with kids around. Personally, we prefer Hyundai departmental shops."
93,4.0,If you have children this is great......they will have a great time. Of course it isn't as amazing as disneyland but it is so much fun and isa really big park ......it even has a castle! You could certainly spend a full day exporing even if you dont go on the rides.
94,5.0,"purchased one day pass, we downloaded the magic pass which we can avoid the long queue, well we did not stay long, we already tired after few games, we were a middle age couple who trying to have some fun, apparently we had fun, but for sure we will not come back for second time."
95,5.0,"Every time I think i've been to the biggest mall in Seoul, we stumble upon another one. This one is no joke, it has everything all in one place. Great food options, great name brand stores across all price ranges. Lots to do and see if you don't want to be outside or the weather isn't good. Doesn't hurt that there is also a theme park right across the street, as well as a large outdoor lake to walk around."
96,5.0,"Got 50% discount coupon from the website and it was a super cool theme park. There are so many rides both indoor and outdoor, plus shopping and eating! The view was great too as it was the full bloom of cherry blossom, thus you can enjoy the nature and have fun at the same time!"
97,4.0,"We were visiting Seoul and our hotel had a shuttle to the lotte World - we not dropped there, We did not feel ike paying 45$ for the rides even if for a week day it is probably ok as there is no much lines. Walk down the skate rink and watch all these future speed skater olympic winners.. Then walk yourself out, cross the street and walk toward the castle, you can enter the beer garden (baden-baden) and enjoy a Kloud (the only acceptable Korean beer IMO) in the sun..."
98,5.0,If you want to take the rides of both Indoor & Outdoor Parks you need to be there very early since the queue will be long.For people who don't want to ride any indoor or outdoor rides but wants to see the view then you can take the 4pm entry which it is less cheaper.If during rainy days you can enjoy the Indoor view & rides but obviously not the outdoors.
99,4.0,"You need more than a day to explore the whole place. From mall, restaurants to amusement park. A nice place to visit. Various popular international brand shops and international cuisine restaurants."
100,3.0,"Definitely a great place for kids and families, as long as your kids don't mind the wait. My husband and I went by ourselves over a holiday weekend because they had a 50% discount for foreigners. The lines were just unbearable, but I suppose this is Korea. Because half of the park is indoors, I felt very overwhelmed by all the noises and people. If you can go on a weekday when the lines aren't so long, it's probably worth it."
101,4.0,"This place was fun, but very crowded on a rainy day so lines were extremely long! I mean hours long which made it less fun. I would go again though for sure."
102,5.0,"We loved it here! It's like an indoor Disney World for all. So much to do and see from ice skating, roller coasters, shows, food, and so much more. Place was huge. The staff were all helpful & accommodating. Definitely one place we will go back to next time we are in Seoul. Highly recommend!"
103,5.0,"Like my visit here , its like wonderland though i can t take any rides this trip is still worth it .Theres just too many people queveing up for the rides..too bad"
104,3.0,Went with my boyfriend. Ride lines were ridiculous some over 1 or 2 hours wait. We just enjoyed our own company and ate around. Next time hope to go when less busy. Expensive price to get in. My boyfriend said prices had gone up in ticket. Overall good experience.
105,1.0,"Awful awful awful. We spent a lot of money to get in (plus transportation) and the wait for each ride, even the kids' rides, were 120 minutes minimum!! There was little to do and it was a total bust. We were very disappointed!"
106,4.0,They claim to be the largest indoor amusement park. While easily believable I wish they have added more rides or optimised their quee management system to make lines shorter.
107,5.0,"I am 50 and went with my friend and she is 50, she lived in Korea so this was pretty special for her.  Definitely a neat attraction for families and I can attest to this by watching all the little kids having a wonderful time with lots of squeals of delight.  The parade is really neat and there are lots of rides but I am guessing it would be pretty expensive.  There rides are quite like Disneyland, they are trying their best, and their ""theme"" and ""characters"" were a little odd for me (being from Canada) but for little kids from anywhere and the locals, I am sure it would be special.  We walked the whole park, it is quite large and to be in doors is rather amazing."
108,4.0,"If you visit Korea, and you're either an amusement park aficionado or have kids, go to Lotte World Amusement Park.  The usual guidelines: go EARLY!  and There's always a discount coupon available (that is, don't pay full price).  Although it got quite crowded in the afternoon, the queues in the morning were reasonable when we went.    We often got a bit lost, but eventually we found helpful directional signs.  The stage shows had surprisingly well-trained (Russian?) dancers in absurd costumes and kiddie narration in Korean.  The food and souvenirs were reasonably priced; and there were plenty of places to sit or stand and get your bearings.  The ice rink at the bottom served as an orienting and comforting center to the place.  In all, it is stunning to have such a space in the middle of a huge metropolis!  Plan to spend the whole day, and more."

113,4.0,"This small but exciting amusement park, you can enjoy all exiciting ride. However, it is a little bit expensive."
114,3.0,"Stores were high-end, and much more international merchandise - the prices were not for the budget traveler.  Insadong had great low prices in the many street markets, however, Lotte World was a fun place to stroll and grab lunch."
115,5.0,"I just simply can't say anything bad about it. Many people here compare this place with other huge amusement parks in the world. Well, it's a different place. Don't expect it to be the same. It IS in fact the largest indoor amusement park thus it's very popular so it's normal to have so many people there. Yes, the waiting can get too long but it's no different than in any other popular amusement parks. It is expensive too but the variety of the rides and other games, the pretty views, the shows and the overall magical mood of the place totally makes up for it. There are many cheap restaurants and some souvenir shops inside. Also, if you go to their website, they usually have discounts, especially around holidays (Christmas, Halloween) and for foreigners, also, you can just buy the afternoon ticket. All it takes is a little research. It's better to go on weekdays to avoid the crowd. I think it's more about the mood and less about the rides. Been there 3 times and always had a good time!"
116,1.0,"Billed at the largest indoor amusement park in the world. Such a let down. Very expensive to get in the door ($33 a person) and that includes NOTHING, you have to pay for all rides inside. If you want to go ice skating there is a rink here, but you have to pay a fortune to get at it. Inside is all small children stuff outside is more adult, however it's really packed with pre-teens hanging out in lines that are two or more hours long per ride. I would suggest skipping this unless you really want to throw your money away, have tons of time to burn or have a very small child to bring with you."
117,4.0,"There are few indoor theme parks and lotte world is just the one, the big one. With so many interesting activities for children and even adults, lotte world is so crowdy! I have to say that I really like it, even though I an adult."
118,4.0,"We were lucky enough to be in Seoul close to Thanksgiving and they had a 2 week foreigner special (50% off tickets!). So we went to check it out. Definitely a cool place! Not too many adult rides but there's some good ones - but be prepared to wait an 1hr+ for some, but try to get some magic passes! Pretty cool to see the inside with the multiple floors - the largest indoor theme park in the world! The outdoor area is also really nice. Some rides we really liked were the: balloon ride, french revolution and Atlantis (pharaohs fury was unfortunately closed, and the flume ride was too long of a wait)! Probably wouldn't have come if we had to pay full price, but had a great time. Also: with your ticket you get free entrance into the folk museum on the 3rd floor! Actually really cool and they have a miniature village section with great models. Not too many people visit the museum, but def worth checking out!!"
119,4.0,"My first time in a balloon ride and like any first timer,, I more than enjoyed the ride, being an indoor theme park, the space was limited compared to outdoor theme parks like Ocean Park, Disneyland, etc.  I also enjoed the Pharaoh' revenge ride.. Also too oir lunch inside.."
120,4.0,High end shopping mall with tax free prices and nice food court...but it is expencive compered to so no bargins or good deals...but ask for a extra discount on very expencive items...
121,4.0,"Hi! Lotte world was a last minute decision because we were bored in Seoul after being there for 10 days. And I have to say it was a well spent day:) it is easily accessible by train to jamsil! I went on a Monday and the queue was not too long, probably a 15mins average waiting time! I went from 11am to 6pm and I managed to ride almost all the rides. Heads up first,  for those who love crazy scary rides, this probably will not satisfy you 100%.  However, for those like me, who enjoy a moderate level of fear rides, this will be an enjoyable trip! They do have one roller coaster that was said to be the scariest, but I didn't try it so I can't comment. However judging by the speed, loops I saw and the screams I heard, it should be satisfying for any fear-seekers. The coolest part about this park was that it was indoors and outdoors. I loved the outdoors more cause it had more fun rides there! There was a ride I loved so much I went on it for at least 3 times. Furthermore, they had those cycle sea ducks I always see on korean variety shows that was free!  Overall this was one of the better theme parks I've been! Should give it a shot^^"
122,3.0,"This amusement part located in jamsil, eastern part of Seoul, has many rides but nothing special. It's rides are quite old and they don't seem to add new ones these days. But still it's always fun visiting an amusement park. But be aware that they had some safety accidents few years ago."
123,4.0,"I've been here twice; the first trip was amazing the second trip was horrible.So what made the first trip great and the second trip horrible? Maybe it was luck because we went on a week day in April and it was pretty much abandoned compared to the second trip. The second trip was also on a week day but was in May and it seemed every school is Seoul was there for an end of the school year trip. The first trip there we were able to go on rides without any wait time with the exception of a couple of the bigger rides later in the day (we noticed more people there, teens who had come after school) but even later in the day the lines were not as outrageous as the second trip there. On the second trip the wait time for most rides (even the smaller ones) was about 1hr 30mins to 3hrs+ (no I am not exaggerating). It was so busy on the second trip that even the rides you wouldn't think would have a wait time, had a long line! I found it very frustrating, we finally gave up and left because we couldn't find any ride that had even a smallish line. Soooo with all that being said here's some great things about Lotte World. A lot of it is indoors so it makes for a nice rainy day activity. If you can get the military discount it cuts the admission in half (show your ID at the ticket counter, if they don't understand, move to another line and try again). The food prices are not outrageously expensive like most amusement parks in the States. They have two admission prices: 1 that includes admission and rides and 1 that just includes admission and no rides (great option for parents or grandparents). This place has more than rides, they have a small arcade and a lot of little ""claw"" machines scattered all over the place, shows/performance acts on the big stage (most are a bit babyish and intended for the little ones), and lots of food options (sit-down, fast food, snacks, etc).Some not so great things about Lotte World. I think the price is a little high but alright if you're lucky enough to be there on a day that isn't busy. But if you're there on a busy day it feels like a bust. I don't know about you but waiting in line for hours to take a ride that's only a couple of minutes takes all the fun out of it for me. Depending on the day/month some rides are closed due maintenance. I was heartbroken the second trip because my two favorite rides were closed, major bummer!"
124,4.0,"you must visit if traveling with kids, the place is huge. either is the biggest indoor theme park I think but not so sure. you can find mickey and minnie mouse is different way, as Lotte character."
125,5.0,It was a rainy monday so we didn't have many choices on touristy places to visit & so gave this place a go.It's recommended if You 1. Have young kids 2. Have 2-3 hours & $ to spare 3. Love taking photos 4. Enjoy ticking off first / biggest sort of places in your travel list and/or 5. Want to go ice skating in summer I'm biased as I enjoyed going here partly because I've seen it in lots of kdramas. This is where we first tried korean fried chicken (Lotteria) & enjoyed eating against a colourful backdrop of balloons & stuff. The parade was also nice & fun. The highlight for us was the folklore museum - the dioramas in the miniature village were really good & something even non-history buffs would appreciate judging by my husband's reaction.
126,3.0,"Lotte World consists of outdoor and indoor theme park. Outdoor theme park is kinda small, with a snow white castle as well. If you are not interested with rides, you may purchase the ticket without ride. There are some skin care shops too. I didn't go for rides but I visited the shows and kinda interesting. There is parade show (at about 8pm if not mistaken)."
127,3.0,"We thought it was the ""world's largest indoor theme park,"" but it's ""one of the...""  We don't have kids, but we thought it would be good for a rainy day.  There was really only 1 roller coaster...My husband liked the 3 shooting games, but besides that there wasn't much for us.  Food is overpriced.  We ended up doing 9 ""rides"" but that averaged out to $8.50 per ride (for 2 ppl)... Something to see, but not so fun if you don't have kids."
128,4.0,The easiest in term of transportation if you need to go to lotte world. Just go to jamsil via subway. One of the exit leads to lotte entrance. Its also connected to a lotte shoppong mall. So you can throw two stone at once. The park is extremely beautiful. Too bad when we went there its buddha birthday so the rides took hours for us to play. Outdoor rides is more extreme  and indoor is more to adventure. Parade is great. And yes theres and ice skating rink available. Trick eye museum.
129,5.0,"We (my wife - Korean, and I - American) visited Lotte world on the second-to-last day of our Korean vacation. This park is immaculately kept; not a single piece of trash, garbage, etc. to be seen. The rides were very exciting (especially considering that most of them are indoor), and we had the opportunity to try out their new outside roller coaster. In true Korean form, I received a 50% off discount on the entrance price ""because of my birthday;"" which is Korean for ""we give Americans free stuff!"" Even though we were at an amusement park, there were many instances where I, being the 6' 1"" foreigner that I am, was the main attraction. =)"
130,4.0,This is a Korean take on the Theme park. It has 4 good coaster/rides which we rode multiple times. It is quite compact but really well laid out.I really liked the indoor section as this is not something usual for most theme parks.Beware when it rains that outside rides may not run.Although nothing like the big US parks it has a strangely quirky and characterful feel to it which we found endearing.
131,3.0,"I hope you like waiting, because that is what you will do in Lotte world. It was hard to comprehend waiting for over 2hours to go on rides that really don‚Äôt look that good. Luckily, Lotte world does have signs that show how long the approximate waiting time is for each ride so you can skip the ride queues. Also, the queues for entry tickets at the ticket booth can be incredibly long as well. It‚Äôs worth going for a wander to find an automated entry ticket machine and get your tickets through that. Inside, Lotte world is visually stunning. The beautiful ice rink below balances out the craziness going on above your heads. But just because you can see the ice rink, that doesn‚Äôt mean your entry pass to Lotte world allows you to use it. It is run as a separate entity that you cannot access without leaving Lotte world, which does not do passouts. If you are half decent at darts, you will win a whole bunch of prizes with the fairground games. It was a great way for me to get presents for my niece and nephew. These were games where you had to pop balloons with darts from about 2 metres away. When you are used to aiming for triple20‚Äôs, it was a great feeling to be good at darts! I believe Lotte world would be a fun day out, if you went on a day where the crowds weren‚Äôt bordering along biblical lines. Even after a day where we left at 6pm, there were thousands of people waiting to be let in! So go early, go on a weekday and don‚Äôt plan on Ice Skating."
132,2.0,"Visited here last Thursday evening (just before a Korean holiday weekend) at 8pm with my girlfriend. Thought the chance to walk around for 17,000 won would make it worthwhile for my first visit, but this is a poor date location. Lotte World was mobbed with middle-school students in their school uniforms taking selfie pictures with every attraction in site. Lines were long even late in the evening, and the indoor section of the park closed down completely from 8:25-9:10 for a ""parade"", which was pretty lame.Lotte World is pretty old and not that large, though conveniently located in the middle of Gangnam, so considering the value of the land it sits on the park is a reasonable size. The few rides we took (without the long lines) were quite basic... shooting some dragons, a 3D haunted-house movie, and a balloon IMAX movie that my girlfriend found entirely disappointing ... not the balloon simulation that she was expecting. Anything worth riding had a 20-30 minute queue, and just about every line was closed by around 9:30pm, so you just don't get to try anything with the late admission ticket.For 2 adult visitors, Lotte World was very underwhelming. Avoid."
133,4.0,"There was a lot to do here, though me and my husband basically just walked around and relaxed.  The lines were very long, so other than food, we did the balloon ride, the trick art museum, and that's about it.  It would have been great for kids.  We also watched the characters put on a show from a hot dog places' window."
134,4.0,It's was a very exciting to watch a big toy land almost semelr or some typical design and characters such as Desiny Land but little bit expensive tickets which deserve somehow.
135,4.0,"Like a mini disneyland hong kong. Spent a day here in the rain - most rides were operational. Indoor ice skating rink was cool but had to pay extra to get in (annoyed but wasn't that much extra). The lotte world adventure ticket is already quite pricey..Most kids are more suited for kids but we went on the- gyro drop- comet express (really cool rollercoaster ride)- the haunted house (laughed more than being scared)- giant loop (heaps fun)Be prepared to wait in line, dedicate a day trip here. The fantasy mask parade was interesting to watch - mix of asian and caucasians performing. Families with little kids may be invited to join the performance as well. There was a mirror maze which we had lots of fun in!Overall a fun day out!"
136,3.0,"We visited Lotte World in April 2015 during our trip to Seoul. The whole infrastructure is very impressive. It is a huge complex with both indoor and outdoor facilities. The rides were of high standard and offered some great excitement and are made of modern and quality materials. Restaurants, cafes and snack stalls/stores are widely available and you don't have to walk far until you come across the next one. While everything is huge, impressive and contemporary, it seemed quite dull and lifeless to me. There were some nice things to see but the overall experience was just... boring to be honest. I'm sure it's different for kids, but there are theme parks that can excite even the dullest of adults.We also found the price to be quite steep, the day pass was close to USD 50.00. Should you decide not to take any rides, their entry fee was still pretty hefty at USD 31.00 for a day. Seoul is such an exciting city, if I knew beforehand about Lotte World; I wouldn't have bothered and would have spent the money going someplace else."
137,5.0,"Having visited a number of historical and educational places in Seoul all week, we decided to visit Lotte world on our penultimate day. We opted for the post-4pm ticket which costs about 80% of the usual price, but we still stayed for 6 hours and got lots done. The attractions range from simple arcade games to bumper cars to roller coasters. Having he majority of the park inside you don't have to worry about the weather. Plus it looks truly magnificent. The indoor rollercoaster is great, as well as the outdoor ones. On first appearance we didn't really see a lot, whilst it looks impressive we thought it was aimed more at younger children, but we soon stumbled upon more rides the further we looked. Lotte world is a true Narnia at the back of the Lotte shopping mall and caters for young children through to adults. Queuing time was okay, having gone on a Friday evening we didn't wait more than 40 minutes for a ride. The evening show at 2030 is a real highlight and is a Disney-esque style parade and a spectacle to watch. If you don't want to dedicate a whole day to it, visit in the evening like we did after a day of doing other stuff (we visited the Olympic park in the local area). You won't be disappointed."
138,4.0,"Young people will love this place. Quite, cool attractions. But restaurant.... I never visit again. It's better to buy food from outside."
139,2.0,"We visited for a day during our week stay in Seoul.  As adults we wanted some thrilling rides.  We went on a Wednesday so the crowd wasn't that bad.  I think the longest we waited for was 40 minutes.  Anyway the indoor rides are alright.  You get a nice view of the whole scene on a couple of them.  The outdoor park is where all the fun is.  I really enjoyed Atlantis and the Gyro Drop.  On the other hand, the food is really terrible.  The vendors don't keep their food at a warm temperature.  We tried three different vendors and barely ate anything.  We were starving on our way out ready for some real food."
140,3.0,"This place tries very hard to be like disney, all of it's character have a clear disney counterpart, and the parades have characters from the public domain that Disney uses.  Even the rides are knockoffs of classic disney rides (Sinbad = Pirates of the Caribbean).  That being said it was fun to see, and the rides were fun.  Lotte World isn't as pristine as Disney parks, but it is cheaper, and less crowded.  All of the rides had fairly long waits later in the day.  It seemed like when school got out, all of Seoul's youngsters came here.  We had fun, but I don't think we would go back.  If you are a fan of Disney parks, you need to check this place out, it is very amusing to see."
141,3.0,"Lotte World is a lot of fun if you can manage to time it right and go on a day when it is not wall to wall people.  Most of the time it is extremely crowded and very long waits to get on anything.  The good parts are that food and things like it are priced very reasonably, about what they would be outside the park.  Also the size and scope of the indoor portion are pretty impressive."
142,5.0,"i go to lotte world in april , and there are little bit cold and that day so many people bcoz there are already vacation , waiting 1 hours to try one attraction , great location and best attraction"
143,3.0,"I purchased annual pass with my wife and enjoyed very well.The best thing of Lotte World is location: it is LOCATED IN Seoul! and has great public transportation access. If you are residing in Seoul, annual pass will be great choice for you. Just visit here after quitting your office (or school) with your annual pass! ""Lotte World in weekday night"" is less crowded than other popular area in Seoul. (But it's crowded in the weekend, like another theme park)Lotte World is indoor theme park in urban area, so there is not enough space to expand. (someone might think the park is small) Single day would be enough for visit."
144,5.0,"Me and the wife took in a whole day here just being kids again, a good place to laugh and just cut loose together, and it's also good for getting your shopping in, fun for all ages."
145,3.0,"As it was terribly cold when we visited Seoul, we decided to visit this theme park instead of Everland as it's nearer in location and has a indoor park. The rides indoor are more for children, but when you step outdoor, the rides are much more exciting. Not as great as other international theme parks, but it serve its purpose well."
146,3.0,"I visited Lotte World during winter and maybe this affected my experience but I couldn't find anything exceptional in this park, the attractions are in the average, the most interesting part for me was that a big part of the park is indoor and you can arrive there directly with the subway, spend time inside and then continue your visit in the outdoor part of the park.In my opinion is a good place to visit if you have children and the weather is not the best, otherway there are much better park to visit."
147,4.0,"Just about in every Korean drama, there will be a visit by the couple to Lotte World. It is Korea's local version of what Disney is to USA, with Korea's own creations of characters.It is worth a visit where adults can enjoy rides and the Gyro Drop is one of the favourites, taking you up with a sudden drop. Not recommended during winter as this is an Outdoor activity and will be too cold. There are a lot of other Indoor activities and rides to enjoy despite the cold winter season, like the Viking, and an indoor Balloon ride circulating the park. For kids, there are a lot of milder rides and watch out as well for their indoor parades and entertainment shows. And yes, an ice skating ring too !"
148,2.0,"Lotte world does not fair well in comparison to any other amusement park in existence. Despite reading the average reviews for this place, especially during Winter months (December 2014), my partner and I decided to give Lotte world a chance since it took the title for largest indoor theme park. We paid a hefty 46,000 won for entrance to find that the only rides available were mediocre ""teacup-like"" rides and required at least 100 minutes of wait time. The rides looked lifeless and dull, even for children. I cried in the horror house (which was actually a 3D show) because it was so boring and poorly made.The outdoor park seemed much more interesting with the majority of ""thrilling rides"" residing here. However, at least 4/5 of the slightly more thrilling rides were closed. Because snow has just started to fall in Korea, the floors outside are very wet and slippery. When walking outside, be very cautious.Another piece of advice; when using the lockers, make sure you have everything you need with you because if you open it to retrieve things, you will be charged again for trying to re-lock it.Overall, if you have children, this may be a considerable place to visit when in Korea. But I personally would not come here ever again. My experience was also partially affected by the amount of young and loud adolescents who were obnoxious and disrespectful on rides and in lines.Disappointed."
149,3.0,"a very big theme park with indoor and outdoor facilities. easily accessible by metro. took us about 30 mins from hongik univ station which the distance is so much nearer to Everland. very easy to find the theme park once you are out of the station. the signage were adequate in my opinion even if you dont understand korean. there were parades fixed at certain timing which you can enjoy by standing at the side. inside the indoor theme park, there is a small version of trick eye museum. we spent about 15 mins to complete the pictures. don't expect much though. once stepped outside to the outdoor theme park, the first impression was.. totally feels like Disneyland. the layout and colors were very similar. queues for rides were about 30 minutes since I went on a weekday.overall, the theme park is reasonably entertaining. cater 30% kids 70% adults. 7 hours inside the theme park is more than enough (including lunch and queue)"
150,5.0,"Guiness book of record being the largest indoor theme park.Amusement park,island with a lake and mono rail travel,malls everything looks a replica to Tokyo Disneyland to a extent.A must to see if in Korea"
151,5.0,Visited this place 4 years ago. This is a must Visit place in Korea. The amusement is very big and fun. Games are very exciting and enjoyable. I enjoyed all the rides there. I hope to visit this place again in the future. I strongly recommend this place to everyone going to Korea.
152,5.0,"The place looks awesome -- fantastic for wide eyed kids (and kids at heart like me)The kiddie rides are fast queueing.  The other ""adult type"" rides of course have long lines and a waste of stay time.The lunch queueing is worse.  Aladdin should add more cashiers when the lunch surge kicks in.  The LONE CASHIER is simply overwhelmed by the volume of people.In all, if rides are all that matter, then this is the best place.  If you're planning on getting the lunch ticket, I suggest you don't.  Bring your own food or just get some from the other hotdog cencessionaires."
153,5.0,"I had never been in a place like this, even in London, Tokyo, New York, Paris is aswome this place is the most luxury Mall in all over the world"
154,5.0,"First time visiting sucha indoor theme park ! watch running man & insist of going there to take a look . went during a off peak period, queues for rides is quite short. we used around 4 hrs to cover indoor & outdoor park."
155,4.0,"This is a nice location for family with young ones. It is relatively small in area compared to Disneyland and thus make it more enjoyable for children less than 10 years old. It has various activity of attraction for the visitors and I could imagine children could enjoy it a lot. It is however, a little boring for adults."
156,2.0,"The place is nice with great rides, but only if you are patient enough to wait in the queue for an hour and a half per ride. We felt like we are not getting much value for our money, since we did not feel like spending the whole day standing in the queue. In the evening some of the rides were closed even though the place was supposed to be open till late, and for this reason the queues were equally long in the evenings. Moreover, you cannot leave the place and go shopping or do something else for a while and then go back, your one day pass is not valid anymore if you leave the area. There was no smoking area in the whole place!"
157,4.0,"Me and my girlfriend went there on a weekday afternoon, when we wouldn't expecting such a long wait for some of the exceptionally popular rides thus we had to skip some of those ride.Price wise for both the indoor & outdoor magic world theme park are reasonable.Rides are suitable for both adult and children for the indoor theme park, while the outdoor theme park cater more to the adult riders. Overall experience for Lotte World is a good despite skipping some of the rides."
158,4.0,We went there as it was known as the biggest indoor theme park. the problem with theme parks is the long queues to get on the good rides.
159,4.0,"It is one of the biggest theme park in the world, in fact, largest indoor theme park.there's also outdoor section.Ice skating and magic island connected to the indoor area by monorail. Like to visit again with grand children."
160,5.0,"I loved it there. Got there early till closure at 23h. Around 40$, you get access to the whole park. Lots of photo zonen for selfie addicts. The decor is amazin and detailed. The attractions are not for thrill seekin persons. That's why I say it's more disneyland type. Beautiful, magical ambiances but mostly relaxed attractions. Perfect for me who gets sick a lot in rides. I went on a weekday to avoid crowds. Lots of people in a peak of 3 hours but after 19h, i was waiting not even 30 min in lines. Had to run in between. There were 2 parades (a day and a laser one at night) plus shows every 2 hours. Love em. There are some pay attractions. Did some. Not worth it. Part is indoor if ever it rains. I recommend. I had fun!"
161,4.0,"We went there on monday morning to avoid the big crowds. Still there were a lot of people and the crowd got bigger in the afternoon. We did some less frequented attractions indoor first but I advise to do the popular stuff first (outdoor Atlantis, Balloon ride..) and maybe reserve one of the popular ones with the magic pass to get fast access (we did not try it but it should be possible). We went there as a couple and there is something to do for every age group. Some thrill rides, something for smaller children and romantic rides as well. It's not nearly as good/big as disney world and the like but still we had a lot of fun. As most of the attractions are indoor it's good alternative on a day with bad weather (in our case it was really hot so we were always happy to get back to the A/C). If it's raining the outside part might be closed."
162,4.0,"After the initial greeting of sweet, fresh faced staff that wave a lot in such a cute Lotte World way you are immediately overwhelmed by the sheer scale of this wonderland. And we are yet to get outside. Indoors is probably more suited to the little people of this world, I mean children but there are still things for the grown ups to do but its outside that you will really be in your element. Apart from the huge ques (30-60min for the popular ones) the rides at this place are pretty awesome though not entirely new and original. But it's a gas and great to immerse in the Korean candy world of a theme park. Off the shelf prices are pretty high but there seems to be many ways to get a discount."
163,4.0,"This indoor/outdoor amusement park is quite pricey, but if you came after 4 pm, you can buy discounted ticket for 26.000 won. Indoor section is most likely for children, but it can be fun for adults too. While outdoor section is filled with some sorts of adrenaline pumping rides. It also has a giant skating rink, but you have to purchase different ticket from Lotte World ticket.Lotte World is easily accessible via subway, since one of the subway station exit is within Lotte Mall."
164,1.0,"We went to Lotte World on a normal working day, no school holiday or something like that, thinking that we would not have to bother with too many visitors and queues. However, the park was overcrowded. They let in masses of pupils who were blocking the attractions in endless queues. An American teacher working in Seoul told me while we were waiting in one of the queues, these were school kids on ""field trips"". Well, remembering my own schooldays in Germany, me made our field trips to museums, cultural organisations and other boring stuff, not to fun parks. So much for the ""hard working"" korean school kids and the ""demanding"" school system in Korea.Many attractions were closed, or got closed during the day, which made the queues even longer.Not worth the high entrance fee - only if you are a korean kid on a ""field trip""."
165,5.0,"I loved this place!) if you are adults go straight to the opened part or the park. You will find many funny, cool and even scared games. But lines are every time, weekdays too. We came there around 3pm but it was enough to  enjoy the most interesting attractions. So you won't regret if you visit this park. Enjoy!))"
166,3.0,"My husband and I decided to visit Lotte World on our last day in Seoul.  We went on a Sunday in the late afternoon, hoping to avoid bulk of the crowds.  This was not the case.  We were warned that it would be busy but with only Disneyland to compare to, we underestimated how popular Lotte World would be.  The price of admission was fair, about $25 per adult if I remember correctly. GET A MAP - this place has so many levels and rides everywhere it would be easy to miss something without getting a free map at the info desk. We didn't get to go on too many rides as waits were were up to 2 hours on some of them.  The ones we did visit were great! Well worth the money just to see the largest indoor amusement park in the world.  If I were to visit Seoul again, I probably wouldn't go back to Lotte World unless it was in the middle of the week when crowds would be lessened. The size and detail of the park is amazing, but I only felt it was average for the waits and crowds even late on a Sunday.  Food selections are OK but not fantastic,  prices for souvenirs are less than they would be at comparable parks in the US."
167,5.0,"It's a MUST-DO in Seoul, especially if you haven't been exposed to the amusement parks. Not crazy fun like Six-Mountains, but you don't have to pay $80 for a day either. You pay $60-70 for Disneyland HK and Tokyo, but I paid only $20; there were plenty of deals to cut the ticket price cut to the half. It's not definitely like dreamland (Disneyland or Universal Studios) or extreme ultimatim (Six-Flags), but I made sure to visit off peak hours, so that I didn't need to queue for a while. The portfolio or rides and equipments were very well balanced, from family to epic-high stuff, and the mixture of indoor and outdoor. Food inside is quite good but pricey as any other amusement parks. There are gourmet restaurants outside the park, so make sure to come out and enjoy the food and shopping. The parade & circus show are something kids love about. I'd visit again. Make sure to avoid weekend or summer time, when youngsters come any time and cause a long queue."
168,3.0,"very confusing, disorganized and disappointing. Most announcements and signs are not repeated in English, some attractions include stories or set phrases... well, we'll never know.There are a lot of games and attractions that are not included into 1 day pass, it gets frustrating when you already get excited about going somewhere... and it requires separate ticket line and payment.A bit too much food places as well, but it is understandable - food is everywhere anyway =))All in all, it's worth seeing if you have some time and money to spend and aren't much of adrenalin junkie. The park had its own special features and has very nice and elaborate decorations."
169,2.0,"I have been here twice,the first time is quite exciting as I enjoyed riding all the thrilling games,Gyro Drop,Atlantis etc..but sadly I have to queue up more than 1 hour just to play 1 of those games. Compared to others theme park, this is not worth your time as you have to be patience enough just to play a game. I went here just because it is famous in drama series like Stairway to Heaven, Athena and variety show, Running Man. Second time I went here, it was raining and I can only play indoor games. In term of entrance fee, it is pricey and not worth it. Plus no more discount for foreigner. Disappointing."
170,3.0,"Took a good look at the infamous ice-skating rink as seen in Boys over Flowers and that was it. Did not take a single ride the entire 4 hours that I was there (It was part of a package tour) because every ride had a snaking queue which meant a wait of at least 45 mins on average. Most of the rides are meant for kids, except a few like Gyro Drop which is located at the outdoor section. Nice place to stay for 1-2 hrs but not a place I'd go back to again unless I have kids with me."
171,2.0,"as it was a bitterly cold day, we decided to visit lotte world late in the day as there is a discount ticket after 4pm. we queued ip for a few rides, but whilst eaiting for another, we were asked to show our tickets. we were stunned to be told that the ticket we purchased simply allowed us to walk around but not go on any rides. people do this?? we had been reassured when we bought the tickets that they were valid for all rides. we waited for the staff to leave and rejoined the line and went on the ride without further incident. its expensive if you by a day ticket and frankly not worth the money."
172,3.0,"First time visited an underground themepark. Staffs are friendly, but not all. Visited there during winter so some of the attractions are closed. :-( Most of the rides need to queue for super long, around an hour. But overall experience was good."
173,3.0,Its crowded all the time and its a place where the kids are running around doing whatever they want.. I got a chance to go for free because of a card program my friend had so it was ok cause i didnt have to pay anything to get in. The lines to go in are long and the rides are ok but they were doing alot of renovations and most of the things were closed off and no access granted to other things.. I was disappointed but we made the best of it. There are alot of other places better to go than Lotte World.. try everland its alot better in my opinion.
174,1.0,Bought a ticket on a one-by-44000 KRW. This ticket with all the attractions. Very much to people. It is difficult to walk around one people. Queue on the rides a half or an hour of waiting. Not a day as many tickets to sell. People do not have time nor the rides and eat. Waiting in the cafe for an hour.
175,1.0,"I visited lotte world today and was so disappointed. The queues for any of the decent rides were over an hour long, I left having only been on one ride. A huge waste of money!"
176,2.0,"Lotte World certainly does not live up to the hype. No thrill rides, long lines, etc. Totally not worth it! The only redeeming quality of this attraction would be the Folk museum."
177,5.0,"My husband and I went here by ourselves (37yrs old) and loved it.  Lots of it was very young but was still great to be around. What a fantastic amusement park. Like nothing I have seen before. Worth every cent of the entry fee.  My husband loved the museum.  It was very interesting, and great for the adults to kill some time while the kids play. Although it is great for the kids too.  I just loved seeing the kids having a ball. The ice rink in the centre of the ground floor was awesome, we watched loads of little kids getting their skating lessons.We got a suprise at night when the laser show started. We had no idea it was coming and there were pyrotechnics, a huge screen telling a story and massive flames around the centre, and of course we had no idea we were standing right next to one and got the fright of our lives.The outdoor part was fantastic. We went outside at night time, so some things were closed but still great. Live bands; the list just goes on and on.  This place is fantastic and I highly recommend it.  The variety of activities to do is endless.  Let your inner child out and have a ball.We never made it to all the shops but they looked great. You can easily spend a whole day here. We chose to stay at the IBIS Seoul Ambassador nearby and caught a taxi to Lotte world and back.If I know anyone going to South Korea, I always recommed this place as a MUST!!"
178,5.0,"The attraction and the show are fantastic. No wonder, disneyland and universal studio don't want to open their heme park at seoul. The size is big, you can spend a whole day at this place."
179,3.0,"Lotte World is a place where dreams go to die, and are reborn in mediocre rides and junk food.  The lines are long, but the people-watching is fantastic.  I kept expecting the indoor part of the park to start falling apart at any minute.My wife and I were there for an entire day.  Our first ride was Sinbad - a subtle and horrific hat-tip to Disney's ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" ride.  It was fantastically awful, and when I was finally splashed by the water, I expected it to burn through my clothes.  Our second attraction was an insect/rain forest mashup that featured lots of empty insect viewing cages and many children that perhaps should have been in some of those cages.  Then we ventured outdoors, for the real fun......Of waiting in line for 2 hours for ""Atlantis.""  Actually a pretty good roller coaster - the ride consists of going in and out of a man-made mountain, and has two main runs.  Again, not bad.  However, the other rides (all 8 or so of them) all had very long lines, and we were getting cold, so we ventured back inside.Our finale consisted of a tea-cup inspired ride that had a large cobra in the middle, and revolved just quick enough to entice the junk food our of your stomach.  Not bad, but perhaps a ride to be taken earlier in the day, before food consumption.Many of the indoor attractions and rides cost a little extra.This is a genuine piece of Korea, and while many foreigners might scoff at the rides and general condition of the place, the people-watching is superb."
180,4.0,"Entry after 4pm is discounted, and foreigners also get a 15% discount. It was pretty busy with teenagers and families on a Friday night. Be warned that some rides close early in the evening, so plan your trip well. The rides are fun, with Atlantis being the best! Although there were some very long lines, there are plenty of places to eat, drink and hang out. Yes, it's lame, but you'll have fun!"
181,3.0,"Well, we are not kids any more but we still wanted to go there for a visit.The exciting rides outside were good but having to wait good half an hour for one. Depends on if you are very keen on them. We were not.The indoor rides were average as they are very slow moving. Either for younger kids or accompanying by parents to ride.The parade from different stories were highlight of the visit. You must see this one."
182,4.0,"If you are travelling with young kids or teenagers, a day out at the Lotte World with the family should prove to be decently good entertainment and fun for all."
183,5.0,"It was very fun, there are lots of games, and shops and food. it was really nice, had a great time there. but the waiting time for the game is quite long so we did not get to play all the games that we want to play."
184,2.0,This amusement park is not worth the price of admission. The rides are geared towards young children.  The adult rides have extremely long lines and not very exciting.  I will not go again~
