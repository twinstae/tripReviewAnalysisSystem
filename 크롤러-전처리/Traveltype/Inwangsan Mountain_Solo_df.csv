0,4.0,"The hike was quite easy even if you're not much fit (but you will need to stop dozen times aling the way). The scenery was great, you can observe the Namsan Tower from far, the Bukhansan Mountain, the Blue House. Start off from  Gyeongbukgong station, take bus 7020/1020/7022 to Jahanum bus station. Take left onto the road, and your hike begins. Go aling the city wall until the last one where you'll need to take bus no 5 to go back to Gyeongbukgong station."
1,5.0,"If you don't want to take on the more challenging Mount Bukhansan, Ingwansan Mountain is a great alternative. But be warned, it's still a serious workout! I took plenty of rest breaks on the way up.The hike to the top and back down can be achieved in 2 to 2 1/2 hours, even if you're a bit slow. But you do need to be reasonably fit - there are a lot of steps on the way up, and a rocky path descending. I've noticed someone saying the trail is hard to follow, which I did not find to be the case. Simply follow the old city wall up and down, and you won't get lost. If you're doing this hike alone, as I did, be aware that there aren't too many people on the mountain (which is a good thing!), so take a mobile phone, plenty of water, and a jacket in case the weather turns. On a hot day it's a hot walk. Very windy at the peak. Nevertheless, a steady trickle of other hikers will pass you, so if you do have problems you should still be able to ask for help. If you're getting about on public transport, take the Metro to Geongukgung Station, Exit 3, and take a bus number 7212, 2010, or 7022. Get off at Jahamun. Cross the road and you'll see a path leading up to the right, that takes you to the old city wall. Follow these steps to the peak, then continue to follow the trail down the other side. You'll come out amongst a lot of apartment buildings. Walk down the winding road for a bit, find the steps that go down to the main road, and you'll be near to Dongnimmum Station where you can take a train back to the city. Make sure to wear sturdy footwear, but no specialist hiking equipment was needed when I went."
2,4.0,"If it is summer, come here as early as possible. It is a steep and sweaty hike up from the metro station. You will pass some shaman shrines, the guide advised against taking photos of the shrines to show respect. One idea is to come here early and visit the prison afterwards. Another idea is to start your walk along the city wall from here, if you do that, bring plenty of water and some snacks (start early)."
3,5.0,"Amazing mountain climbing along Seoul City Walls. Be careful for each step.- Starting from the west (near Muakjae Station or Sajik Park) is recommended for an easy ending(near Changeuimun Gate).- Obviously, this is an easy mountain comparing to others in Seoul. But, still needs to be careful on a rocky mountain. Start to go down before it's too dark. Some tracks don't have lights and they're risky.- Looking around the top near the sunset is beautiful.- 2~3 hours depending on pace. it has almost no shade while climbing. Visiting during summer will require carrying some water. WInter climbing is not recommended for the safety.- Also, there are other places to see on the mountain such as Hwanghakjeong Archery Field, Dangun Shrine, Changeuimun Gate, Sukgulam Temple, Suseonngdong Valley, Mumudae Observatory, etc. Good to visit if you're not in a hurry.- Seoul City Walls connect to Bukaksan Mountain after escaping to the east."
4,5.0,"Amazing way to get away from the city even though you are still in Seoul.Thus, it was originally built to protect the city, so it's very cultural!A must go place if you're in Seoul!"
5,4.0,"There are many trails to go to the top of the mountain. There are many stairs at the beginning of the climb, but as you progress, the journey will become harder as the trail can be quite steep. Nice workout!! I sweated all over although i hiked it during the winter. In winter, once you reached the top, all you can see is thick mist, so it is not  advisable to climb it during the winter."
6,4.0,"This is a hike that involves climbing a lot of steps and stairs up to the top.  There is a small section, closer to the top, that is steeper and requires a bit more care, but all in all, this hike can be done in less than an hour to reach the summit.  It is impossible to get lost since you just follow the fortress wall all the way.  The views of Seoul are great!How to get there:Take the subway to Gyeongbokgung station.  From there, take exit 3 out of the station and turn right.  There is a bus stop just after Starbucks.  Take bus #7212, 1020, or 7022, and get off at Jahamun stop.Once off the bus, cross the street onto road where the museum is.  Walk along the path until you get to the first police post.  From there, turn or look to the right for the wooden steps up.  Go up the stairs and follow the fortress wall all the way up.Once at the top, you can backtrack back down, OR, you can descend down the opposite side of the mountain.  Follow the fortress wall (there are some steep areas) until you come to the road and police stop.  Turn right on the road, and follow it down.  After about a 20 minute walk thru a neighborhood, you will come to a main street.  Turn right, and you will see Dongminnum subway station (orange line).Hope these instructions are helpful.  This is a great activity on a sunny, clear morning or afternoon."
7,5.0,"No car required: this steep but scenic hike with views over the whole city is very close to Line 3's Dongnimun station. Finding the trailhead is a little tricky. Look for staircases due east of the station, walking between the two station exits on the east side of the road (opposite the prison museum). If you see the city walls, you're headed in the right direction. There are LOTS of steps and some pretty steep bits, but it's worth it."
8,5.0,"I was looking to get out of the city-scape a little and fortunately was staying <1 mile away from Inwangsan! Who knew this little hill (let's be honest, it's not a mountain) was so accessible and had such a fantastic view?? I walked from my hotel near Gwanghwamun, but you could just as easily take the purple line to Gwanghwamun station, or the orange to Gyeongbokgung and walk over. Or taxi. I walked up a street ""Inwangsan-ro"" until I saw other hiker-like people and then followed them :) just keep heading up, and you'll get there! I think it was 4 miles roundtrip from my hotel, took me ~2.5 hours as I was walking leisurely and stopped at a couple places on the way back. Worth it!! Better view than N Seoul Tower in my opinion, and way less crowded!"
9,4.0,Here is one of the mountain where you may enjoy the view of Seoul city. By the way there is two temples and holy rock where the prayers are always avaliable. Be ready to climb high up!
