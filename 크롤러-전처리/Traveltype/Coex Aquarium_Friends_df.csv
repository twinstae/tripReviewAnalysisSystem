0,5.0,"The Aquarium is great for all ages. If you are there at the right time, there is shark feeding at 1:30pm and feeding for other select tanks at 3:30pm. They are very efficient and effective with the use they have and some of the smaller aquarium tanks are artistic design and fun for all ages. There is also one are where kids can tough sea creatures and one tank you can put your hands in and the fish will nibble the dead skin off.  The Aquarium is a good size and there is one place in there halfway through if you have a hankering for a snack or some ice cream. There are many places outside the aquarium where you can eat before or after. There is a fun stamp book for kids as they go through to find stamps along the way."
1,5.0,The fun is in the inner areas. Navigate to see crabs and otters inside. They're amazingly huge and colourful.
2,4.0,"Very nice place for everyone interested in nature. Worth to go there especially when the weather is bad :) Staff is nice and helpful, speak in English. I really like part ""Story about Korean fish""!"
3,4.0,"The aquarium was definitely better than I thought especially you pay 27,000 Korean won ($25). Well-designed with many different fishes I’ve never seen before. It’s an interactive experience where you can actually touch a few sea creatures. If your kids have never been to an aquarium, this is not a bad choice to make. It was enjoyable."
4,5.0,"Lots to see, very well displayed with lots of information also in English - many creatures that we hadn’t seen before in aquariums in England. Funny that they put fish in random things like a phone box and fridge. Would definitely recommend a visit if you like sea creatures. Loved the otters they were so cute !!"
5,5.0,"This has got to be the most amazing attraction that I visited while in Seoul. The Aquarium is smartly divided into different sections so visitors (especially children) can learn a lot of things about marine life. It's great for families, friends, and couples too. The best thing about Coex aquarium is that a wide range of species can be found here and they all are displayed creatively. The mermaid show was amazing as well. The whole place is clean and spacious. I would love to visit it again!"
6,3.0,"The aquarium is tucked away in the mall, but easy enough to find with adequate signs pointing the way. It was a bit underwhelming but large enough to keep you entertained for a couple of hours."
7,5.0,i was first a little taken-aback by how up close and personal you are with apex predators and the lot... it was absolutely a one of a kind unique experience  that none of us will forget! if youre out here for some unholy reason do yourself a favor and dedicate a couple hours here!!!
8,5.0,"you'd think an aquarium inside the basement of a mall would be lacklustre, but wow you'd be wrong. This place is huge and has so many different areas. You can spend a couple hours in here easily. It has pretty much all the staples of a good aquarium. There's a shark tank, otters, an underwater tunnel, educational things, jelly fish, and some extra trendy stuff. It isn't the best aquarium I've been to by far, but it gets a 5star simply because it was way better than expected. Easily accessible by subway and you can spend a whole day here if you like malls. Watch a movie, eat some food, go to a temple across the street, go to an arcade all on a subway stop. This place is also one stop on bus from the airport for about 15 bucks. So even a great stop over spot when in Korea"
9,1.0,"Aquarium is okay, not really spectacular but not bad. It is in my mind a good educational experience for children.However parents  are terrible at controlling their children. People touch the fish in the tanks even though people are prohibited to do so (Korean and Chinese were the only one we saw doing so at that time). In the Marine Touch Lab it is even worse, there are clear instructions how to behave and what to do. However parents with seriouse dillusions of grandeur, think the animals are indestructable and people just manhandle them. Here are some suggestions:*Close off the tanks so people cannot touch the animals.*Discontinue the touch zone because people are re~￦@%d and cannot behave themselves."
10,3.0,"We went on a Monday and it wasn't very crowded. The main attraction is the huge aquarium with sharks, manta rays, and turtles which was quite impressive. Everything else felt like it was just filler. Great for small kids though. Lots of activities to keep them engaged.We paid 50,000 Won for 2 people and I felt for what was offered it was a bit overpriced. Wouldn't go again necessarily, but I didn't regret going in the first place."
11,4.0,"We enjoyed walking around, learning & viewing.  It's a good aquarium, but not great (like Singapore).Loved the quirky house area where marine life were in everyday home areas: bed heads, fridges, kitchen sinks, etc"
12,4.0,"Good aquarium. Entrance fee is 25,000 KRW. Great location in Gangnam. The one in Busan is probably better"
13,4.0,"I didn't expect a huge Aquarium inside a mall. It looked small when viewed from the entrance, but you'll be surprised how bit it actually is. It had different themes and a good variation of fish and other animals."
14,3.0,"Just an aquarium with some national Korean touches. It's not the biggest one among the oceanariums I have visited, but it is obvious the object is very well maintained. The entrance fee is a little high for such a place. Good place for educational trips with kids."
15,5.0,The aquarium presents a large and rare variety. The whole arrangement is with due consideration of children. The informative boards are in simple but catchy language to attract the kids. And really the kids enjoy it very much. It has a high educative value and is a 'must visit' place for children.
16,4.0,Their aquarium is pretty huge with huge sea animals too. Great for kids. And nice place to take picture.
17,4.0,"I found that it is one of the great aquarium (probably the best one) in Korea!! I didn't expect that much, just thought it would be normal one. But it was really nice and I did like it!! A lot kind of fishes and etc..... The best part was the glass tunnel there I felt like I was under the real sea!"
18,5.0,I loved this aquarium! It was lovely with many species of fishes & huge sharks. Its not over crowded & also pretty diverse with other animals other than fishes.
19,5.0,I went with a friend and we both think it is really a nice and particular aquarium!It is really unique and I think it's a good place to spend a day for families with kids!
20,3.0,"Had a lot of beautiful fish displays but also a fair amount of animals too, like otters and beavers and Guinea pigs."
21,3.0,"This is a ok aquarium but there are some things that let it down. Some of the tanks are a little small but this is due to the fact that it is in a mall. Despite this, it's still a nice way to spend the day. For Conan O'Brien fans, they have Samuel the Octopus on display toward the end of the aquarium. They also have an exhibit of more ""unusual"" fish tanks, with fish inhabiting such things as sinks, fridges and phone booths.This would be a good place to bring children. There's an ""aquarium passport"" that children can pick up and stamp along their way through the aquarium.All in all, a decent enough aquarium but certainly not the best one I've been to."
22,4.0,You must get the feel of this place. Worth spending money on it. You will get to see shark also. It will pass over your hear. It is just awesome.
23,4.0,"The COEX Aquarium is a fantastic aquarium for the price point. It starts off slow with really small fish and sea creatures, but eventually opens up to larger tanks and fish. I would say this COEX Aquarium is almost as good as the Jeju Aquarium, but it's half the price."
24,4.0,"it was my second visit, love the place, clean, lots of things to see. a bit different with my first visit."
25,3.0,"Visited the COEX Aquarium after a visit to Bongeunsa Temple. Not a really big aquarium, tanks are mostly small. However, i enjoyed their ""petting zoo"", whereby we were allowed to get up close to sea creatures. Overall an average experience, for I have seen bigger Aquariums."
26,2.0,"It's in the Coex mall and it's pretty much like every other small aquarium you've ever gone to. If you absolutely have nothing better to do, go ahead and spend 20,000+krw. Frankly, I'd rather walk around the mall (I hate malls), see a movie and have a bite to eat."
27,4.0,I was here few times. And always enjoy my visiting. They had a very wide range of animals and the exhibits are very well maintained. It takes about 2 hours to look through all the exhibits
28,5.0,"Awesome is the word. This place should be in the must go place in your trip. The coex mall in itself is very large and you cannot even imagine so big aquarium inside the mall.They have created an environment where fish can be found everywhere. In refrigerator, washing machine, phone booths etc etc. They have large varieties of fish available. There is also a show inside which is also very good.Overall you will find a day very well utilized in Seoul :) :)"
29,4.0,"Coex aquarium is definitely worth a visit if you have some spare time. The aquarium is well set out,the displays are very well done and it was good to see them feeding the fish.Being in a large shopping mall there is many places where you can get something to eat and do some window shopping after you have been through the aquarium.Look for the Hyundai shopping centre if you are into food. The presentation is something special however check the prices before you buy.Get the subway back. A day well spent."
30,5.0,"I think people are being a little too harsh on this place...In regards to what others have said, ""too expensive"" or ""not worth the price for the size"" and ""I've been to better.""My thoughts on these comments: ""too expensive"" and ""not worth the price for the size""It's 22,000 won for an adult (which is about $22). That's a few dollars cheaper than the other aquariums I've been to. So with that being said I don't think it was too expensive. I also have to say that it felt a lot bigger (maybe even double) the size of the aquariums I've been to (Aquarium by the Bay in San Francisco and Sea Life at the Mall of America.) So I have to say that it's worth the price for the size.""I've been to better""I have to say this tops my list for aquariums. It was mapped out perfectly and you flowed through the place. It was more than just fish but mammals as well. I doubt I'll ever go to another aquarium that has penguins, seals, sea otters, manatees, crocodiles, etc. all in one place. Other highlights for me: cool fish tank displays (working Coke machine, washing machine) and ""Dr. Fish."""
31,5.0,"Lots of information about the fish Lots of fish!  Watched the snapping turtles feed, that was great The Manatees were the cutest I liked the Korea section - fish in Korea I completed the little treasure hunt thing and got all the stamps I think some of the displays were a little strange but creative (fish inside washing machine, fish inside refrigerator, fish inside telephone box etc) I didn't feel that there was enough effort in raising awareness about ocean conservation, but of course there was some at least Ocean conservation education is pretty important to me so I felt that could have been betterYou can touch the starfish And I saw the two huge tortoises mating There were jellyfish (which they didn't have in Seaworld, Yoiudo) And a huge octopus which was sleeping It took a while to get around It took the whole day actually (one hour from where i stay plus lunch and then going home again) I liked how it takes you through all the different waters of the world so you always know which ""region"" you are in when you see the fish Some of the creatures were really massive And they all look healthy and the staff were affectionate towards the animals so... good place :)"
32,4.0,"This is a pretty good aquarium, better than I thought it would be. It is a great place for small children with many features provided for their benefit, like an acquatic petting zoo! There is a tube shaped aquarium with a beautiful array of sharks and rays and other species. There is enough English signage for non-Koreans. Bathrooms are easily reachable."
33,1.0,"My friends and I were visiting Seoul for just 2 days. we decided to take a city tour that included the Codex Aquarium. My friends enjoy diving and marine anything.  The building that houses the Aquarium is a marvel. There are shops and restaurants and meeting places for large events. A huge facility. The entry to the exhibit space is colorful and welcoming.  And then it happens. You see large tanks of huge fish, so full of fish that it looks like one of those choose your own fish for supper places. Sadly, it gets worse, because they also have marine mammals, otters etc. and they have no room to swim, little tiny bits of water in the very front of the case, no privacy areas. They have Bats, where they cannot fly. They have Manatees just in a tank, no environment and with 3 beasts no room to really move and nowhere to move to. Really really sad. The whole thing is just heart breaking.  Kids who don't know any better will love it. But their parents who should know better should not take them there and support this cruel treatment."
34,4.0,"Great place, spent hours in here on numerous visits. Interesting and creative displays and so many different tanks and exhibits. Well maintained and great fun."
35,4.0,"Lots of beautiful creatures in relatively good sized aquariums. Some creatures in cages/aquariums that were far too small. The information boards, for the majority, were easy to translate into common english. The exhibitions were interesting. We had 3 hours to look around and found it not quite enough time."
36,4.0,"When you see the Aquarium from inside COEX Mall, it's deceiving. It seems like it would be a very small aquarium. But once you're inside, it keeps going and going with pleasant surprises. I especially liked seeing the sharks through the clear glass tunnel. I also enjoyed seeing the penguins jump in and out of the water. There are two downsides to this aquarium. It's very crowded on Saturday afternoons which should come as no surprise. You'll be bombarded with kids and some parents that might bump into you with their strollers. Also, the prices are a bit steep (22,000 won for adults, 19,000 for middle/high school students, and 16,500 for senior citizens). But if you're patient, you'll be able to enjoy a nice experience."
37,4.0,If you like aquariums you'll like this one too.Offers good views of the fish and loads of different kinds of fish.Nice attraction for 2-3 hours.
38,1.0,"It's expensive. Around 20,000 won. The space is small, so it gets crowded very easily. The animals were poorly kept. The tanks weren't clean. It had an interesting smell. I was really turned off by the venue. There was one area that seemed to get more attention than all the others. It's an open amazon kind of space. That was the most interesting. I will not go there again."
39,5.0,"Originally I had visited COEX Mall for some shopping but little did I know that it was closed for renovation! I was so devastated until I found out that it has an Aquarium inside. Honestly an aquarium in a shopping mall, I did not think much of it but went in anyway since I didn't want my visit to be an entire waste of time and man was I surprised. I haven't had so much fun in ages, I felt like a little child again. There was a fair number and variety of animals on show and we spent a good couple of hours in here unknowingly. Definitely worth a visit."
40,4.0,"It was kinda boring at first but it became more exciting as I walked further, I saw various of marine life together in one trip, from a tiny jellyfish to a huge shark and mantaray in different size of aquarium! penguin,catfish,manatee, you name it..almost everything can be find here..The not so enjoyable part is, it was too crowded with people especially kids and the price is quite expensive."
41,1.0,"Quite possibly the worst rip-off in Seoul. For $17 admission fee you get little value. You get poor signage, incoherent educational value, questionable exhibits (aquarium with a bathroom setting?) and no standout animal attractions. Save your money and check out the free seafood markets instead."
42,5.0,"I visited this place on last Sunday and trust me it is amazing. You can see fishes everywhere like inside fridge, washing machine and even inside commode. There are a lot of variety of fishes available.To go there you can take subway. You should get down at Samseong Station (Subway Line No. 2). Exits no. 5 and no. 6 of Samseong Station are directly connected to the COEX Mall.About Aquarium : If you are visiting this palace, you should take out atleast 2-3 hours of your busy schedule.Entry fee for Aquarium is 19500 KRW. It is situated on large area. Following things you must do:- Please check feeding program timing, You will enjoy.- Fantastic part of visit is underwater tunnel safari. Below the shark.- You can also see many varieties of jelly fishes. Take a photograph of jelly fishes- Penguins activities.To Eat :- There is some food is available outside Aquarium. You can try that on your own risk. It is good."
43,4.0,"COEX isn’t just all fish.. no they have a small “jungle” themed section with monkeys, tropical plants and elsewhere there are some prairie dogs chucked in for good measure. There are Beavers, penguins, dugong and chipmunks? (squirrels maybe),  OH! And you will find fish in the fridge, washing machine, toilet bowl, kitchen skin, telephone booth and chilling with spider man! This section of unique places to hold a fish is referred to as the “Wonderland” and yes, COEX has thought of it all! I did a blog post on this attraction, its worth the visit but be mindful of long lines on busy days! http://rememberthefirst.wordpress.com/2012/12/15/coex-aquarium-seoul-south-korea/"
44,4.0,"Managed to do a 3 hour visit.  Been to other aquariums such as Underwater world and Resort World's SEA aquarium.  Personally, I feel that it is well managed as it is well divided into different eco systems for fishes (ie, Amazon, Ocean etc). Place is clean and exhibits are plenty.  Downside of this is that the walk from the subway station is kinda far and confusing, though the species of fish are available in English, it can further improved by providing the description of species in English as well.  Overall, still a nice place to visit!"
45,5.0,"There are many many varieties of fishes and other sea animals. Also has sharks, sting rays, giant turtles. Best part is the Aqua Tunnel at the end. It also has some good places to get pictures taken. Overall a very nice place to visit."
46,5.0,"good if u have an interest in biodiversity...sharks are the real attraction..situated in Coex mall.. Will take 2 hours minimum, 19500 fees"
47,5.0,"It's the only place where I saw manatees. They are huge and funny. You can watch them majestically swimming by or mouth-watering crunching on the cabbage. You will see different sharks, big octopus, fur seals and plenty of others animals and fishes. Some fish tanks will make you laugh, some others let you see the very details through a magnifying glass. The place is not big but well maintained and definitely worth a visit."
48,3.0,"When I saw the first set of fish tanks for the early sections of the aquarium, I was pretty disappointed. Being from the Midwest in the United States, you saw pretty much the same fish in the tanks that you'd see in any lake. They even had chipmunks at this aquarium. It was an odd combination of animals to put together. If I remember correctly too, there was a squirrel as well.The place was still decorated with festive Christmas themed fish tanks, which were fun too see, but the thing I liked best were the very cleverly used phone booths, soda pop machines, traffic lights, Korean mail boxes, etc. that were used as fish tanks.They also had an some manatees that were very active as well as many other sea creatures that were very enjoyable to see. The aquarium used its space pretty well, although like all places in Korea, it was VERY crowded and got really hot inside. I am not fond of the constant crowds that are frequently found in Seoul, especially when it's crowds of parents with their young children pushing strollers. I tend to refrain from it as much as possible when going anywhere in Seoul. So if you do happen to be there, I would recommend going when they open. So you can enjoy yourself better."
49,5.0,OHHH!! Amazing aquarium. I have not seen such a big one before. It has lots of see animals to see.  It is for everybody. Do not miss this. Most of the attractions in Korea have discount for foreigners and Samsung employees. check it before taking ticket.
