0,4.0,This is smaller than most other palaces in Seoul. Unhyeongung might be the only smaller one than this today.- Entrance is free of charge. Some office workers visit during lunchtime on weekdays.- This has comparatively less visitors than other major palaces. You'll like it if you want to take a look slowly and quietly.
1,3.0,"In the buzzing Seoul. A good place to slow down after a day in the busy Seoul city. Suddenly, youâ€™ll feel the time slow down. Take a slow walk around the compound, take some pictures and enjoy the shade of the trees."
2,4.0,This place is small but you will find a very interesting part of the Korean Culture and history form Korea. Not too visited by tourist so it is very peaceful and not crowded. Entrance fee is free
3,3.0,"To be honest, I feel bad for this palace. It is a beautiful palace, very tranquil, very serene, but tourists often fail to consider visiting this (or I think, even Korea fails to promote it just as much as they promote Gyeongbukgung and Chandeokgung). It is a small palace and when we got there, I can count in my fingers the number of visitors checking it. It got buildings there too that aren't as brightly painted like the ones in Gyeongbuk and Chandeok. =(Yes, it does look like the other royal Korean palaces but if one decides to do the ""Five Grand Palaces"" tour while in Korea, then this this place shouldn't be skipped."
4,3.0,"This palace is one of the ""Five Grand Palaces"" built by the Joseon Dynasty, it is also the only one free of charge (note, other palaces fees are not too much expensive).It is a quite and rather small palace. When we were there half of it was in renovation, so we could only saw the Main Hall and around the palace, tho I'm pretty sure there is more to see."
