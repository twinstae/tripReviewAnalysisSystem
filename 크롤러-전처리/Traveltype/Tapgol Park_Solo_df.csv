The pagoda in the middle is full of colour and is always full of local old men passing the time of day. There are also a few benches dotted around under the trees. The stone pagoda at the back is beautiful, but somewhat spoilt by the plastic protective case it's in...you can't have it all I suppose. When I visited it was a autumn day so there was lots of colour too."
1,3.0,"Not very special. There is a nice pagoda, but it's hidden in a glass building, so it's hard to take a good look at it because of all the reflections in the glass."
2,5.0,Finally got a chance to visit where my grandfather participated in the March 1st 1919 Independence Movement.  This location is an important part of Korean history and its struggles with Japanese occupation.
3,3.0,Nothing very special with this place but just quiet and small park with some history in it. Worth to visit in case you are near by chance.
4,4.0,"I stopped by this park and it took me about 30-45 minutes to walk around the grounds and stop and read the various plaques.  The highlights are a well-preserved 15th century Pagoda encased in a protective glass structure, as well as a monument towards the front memorializing the Korean Declaration of Independence from Japan.  Students met in this park to announce the declaration in 1919.  Off the beaten path and worth the quick visit!"
5,4.0,"Not far from my hotel in Seoul, was a public park – Tapgol Park – also known as pagoda park.I found it to be a delightful park that was peaceful. It has the statue of Son Byeong-hee. The park has historical significance treasures like Wongaksaji Sipcheungseoktap and Weongaksabi and the Palgakjeong where the Proclamation of Independence was read and was the starting point of the Independence protest in March 1919. Tapgol Park is located on the corner of Jongno 2 ga on the former site of Weongaksa Temple. In fact, it is the first modern park to be built in Seoul. There are some beautiful flowers and shrubs. I saw a number of people practicing Tai-chi."
6,3.0,Tapgol Park is between the intersection of Insadong and Anguk. I was there after shopping in Insadong.
7,5.0,This park is very small but has Huge Korean history.  This is where their independence was announced in 1919.  There are several large sculptured plaques on the wall that surrounds the park inside.  They are all about the war with the Japanese.  It shows the beginning and the end.  I was very fortunate that a local Korean man saw me taking pictures and he came over and walked with me to each plaque and explained each one of them to me.  It was very interesting& sad.  This park also houses the the 40foot tall stone pagoda of wongaksa temple sight.  definitely worth a stop.  It had much more meaning to me since I had a private tour by a local wanting to share history with me.
8,4.0,"Tapgol Park is a small, intimate park in central Jongno-gu in Seoul.It is laid out around a central pagoda with other historic ruins including one of the earliest temples, the National Relic No 2, the Wongaksa Temple built in the reign of King Sejo around the 1460s.Plenty of old men sit around the park talking, smoking and passing the time of day.I was the only Westerner wandering around one mid-morning.There is a great series of carbon or iron motives around the park depicting the reading of the Proclamation of Independence in 1919 with Korean patriots pursuing their dream of independence.Worth a visit."
9,2.0,Found it uncomfortable here - only place in Seoul I did.  Full of old men sitting around.  The statues and the pagoda were impressive but with hundreds of eyes on me I didn't stay long.  Then when I walked onto the side street a vagrant dropped his pants in front of me and pooed in the gutter - not nice overall....
10,1.0,Completely deserted and no activities happening - please don't visit even if insisted by your tour guides
11,4.0,"The park was close to my hotel, so I went there, it's nothing spectacularly but you can see it in 10-15 min, and it has and old stone formation from an old pagoda."
12,3.0,"Chanced upon this place when I was in Insodong area. There's a really old pagoda in this park, and quite a number of stone murals depicting some wartime history, though I didn't notice any English explanation around. There's really nothing much in the park besides the two main things I mentioned earlier."
13,3.0,This small park amidst the modern buildings is nice but there are many more interesting ones in Seoul. The 10-story pagoda encased in glass is beautiful but hard to admire due to the structure that protects it. If you walk by take a look but otherwise it is not worth a detour.
14,4.0,"I thought this park was very peaceful and lovely. It was a place of relaxation and was very calming. I loved that it was so quite in that place and I saw many couples just walking along together. Some of the imagery is heart wrenching and even if you are not Korean you can understand the pain of the people that were portrayed. No it is not a huge park, but with all the trees and left over parts of the temple it is a very calming place. I only gave it 4 marks due to how many homeless people were there. I think if you are into historical things or if you just enjoy walking around with lots of trees then you should definitely go."
