0,5.0,It is a major part of Korean history and an obvious great source of pride for the country.  I do suggest you see the queens quarters/area to get away from the crowds and manage a closer look at things.
1,4.0,"This was the smallest of the palaces we visited during our trip and it had the lowest admission fee.We entered the grounds of the palace from Chandeokgung Palace and the path was elevated above the grounds.  As we walked down the stairs we saw the first buidlings one of which was used primarily by the King's concubines.   There was a lot less buildings compared to the other Palaces we toured.  However, the grounds were beautifully landscaped.Once inside the main palace complex we saw that a part of it was under renovation.  The main throne room was quite nice with highly detailed ceiling that showed a lot of craftsmanship.  However, after we finished walking through the other parts of the palace there was not much else to see.  We exited back through the entrance and had to show our other palace tickets to re-enter. Overall it was nice but if you only have a limited amount of time then I would skip this one."
2,4.0,"If you want to go in for free, visit one of the neighboring shops to rent traditional Korean outfits. The place is huge and sprawling, the palace was maintained very well. If you plan to visit this place, make sure it is on a bright sunny day as the grounds are not paved so you will end up walking in mud if the weather is bad. So many tourists visiting the place, I suggest coming in early to avoid the crowds. Also, make sure to go towards the east entrance to watch the changing of the guards."
3,3.0,"As all the other places, just the outside of the buildings to see and all of the same decor. Be better to visit this Place when the Wildflower garden is in Bloom. Nice walk around the wooded ares. Adjacent to Changdeokgung Place with an interconnecting gate Ideal to visit both at the same time, There is a charge for both Places except for the over 65's on proof of age."
4,5.0,We walked through this to get to another palace.  Beautiful cherry blossom was blooming everywhere (end of March)
5,4.0,"another nice traditional palace in Seoul. a nice history attached to the palace, typical korean style architecture, a very peaceful ambiance."
6,4.0,This is a truly amazing place. It looks like the secret of Korea is held in this place. A must try to place to visit!!!
7,3.0,this is a smaller palace whose entrance is adjacent to huwon secret garden.  WE went in for a quick 30 minute look around while waiting for our secret garden guided tour to start.
8,5.0,"This palace is one of the top ones to do in Seoul (let's face it, there are a few to do if you have a lot of time) and is within walking distance of Gyeongbokung Palace so you may want to plan for both on the same day."
9,5.0,Great to see this fabulous piece of history. The guards at the lest and right sides are cool to see. Do the fortune thing
10,4.0,This place has some very interesting style and the large expanse makes for a great stroll.  I loved the detail work.
11,5.0,Definitely worth the trip here as it is grand in size and offers a great park to walk around and some ancient royal buildings to look at.  There is actually another palace attached to this one but it takes another ticket to get in....
12,5.0,"When we got there it was very easy to get in and maps were readily available so that tourists could have an idea of the layout of the palace. It was clean, well kept and full of different attractions such as the Korean Folk Museum and an extract of the library to browse through old Korean books. I highly recommend touring the National Folk Museum, it is extremely well laid out with pop up exhibitions and very interesting in general.The weather was pleasant and we got some superb photos of the palace on the lake and even the minor details on the palace. You will see lots of people dressed up in hanboks (traditional dress) and will be taking photos, you can also rent one at the store near the monument. Usually, if you dress up, you can get in for free. We happened to go on a day where the entrance was free regardless."
13,5.0,"I visited all the palaces in Seoul, but I liked this one the best. The palace and halls are smaller, but I liked the wooden details. Moreover, the compound, garden, pond, trees and the Grand Greenhouse, a conservatory built in 1909, are beautiful and calming. You will also see a large variety of  flowers and plants in the greenhouse. Worth a visit!"
14,4.0,This palace is adjacent to the Changdeokgung Palace. It is smaller and seems to have more green space than the other palace (if you don't count the Secret Garden). It has not been as recently painted.  There is a nice hall where you can rest out of the sun on the floor.
15,5.0,"Relaxing and enjoying the wood, flower, and sunny day, thanks God as it was rainy day before.  just one to two hours walking around the palace,  although not many features to see as in a museum, great to see how the wood work and builder work during that period of 19TH century. Originally heading to Changdeogong, but ended up get ticket at Changgyeongong firstly, 1000 won. And then pay another entrance fee to the Changdeogong, 3000 won."
16,4.0,We have visited the palace and found some pretty cherry blossom treesThe entrance is 1000W per adult and free to children up to 6 YOBefore entering we have watched the  ceremony which was magnificent Good for a walk and to set for relaxation between the sakura
17,5.0,"One of three biggest palaces in Seoul.- Popularity might be lower than other two(Gyengbokgung and Changdeokgung). But, this palace is well-organized with nature including amazing old trees. The pond is nice. And has the wonderful greenhouse of quaint plants.- The area is quite a lot. Visitors will have to walk a lot. Take your time and enjoy slowly.- Location: This is locating right north of Changdeokgung Palace connected sharing the fence."
18,4.0,"this palace is sooo recommended! you can go from Anguk Station, its not far away from there (exit 3). this place so magical, I came when Seoul its bit snowy, so its slippery inside but the view so magical. snowy street, calming palace also the good spot to take photo with Hanbok (traditional Korea clothes). This Palace not so crowded as Gyeongbokgung palace (as my experience) but this is must to see when you go to Seoul."
19,3.0,"Went here in November 2016 with my family and it was serene and not too vast. There's a beautiful Lotus Pond at the back of the palace and the wooded areas aren't too tiring to walk at. There are historical items/monuments along the way too with descriptions so you'd understand what it is. I remember ""finding"" this stone turtle-looking monument somewhere in the middle of the woods and according to the description, during the Joseon dynasty, placenta and umbilical cords of the royal babies were kept there. I was such a geek so I love stuff like that so yeah, this palace is worth the visit (especially when Gyeonbukgung and Chandeokgung get too touristy).But the greenhouse was under repair when we went there. The experience would be much nicer if we were able to see that too."
20,5.0,"As palaces goes, Changgyonggung Palace is up there in terms of size, openness and architecture.  It is amazing that the walls separates it from a modern city."
21,3.0,Nothing special but an interesting place to visit for a few hours.  We enjoyed our visit but it was a hot day so we did not stay long enough to see it all.
22,4.0,"Peace and quiet if you go on weekdays, you can rent a Hanbok at the nearby street area and take beautiful pictures of the palace.Look out for the change of guards in traditional customs."
23,3.0,It was better than the Gyeongbokgung Palace as it was a bit bigger but nothing very interesting about this park. Just a big park with historical buildings.
24,5.0,"A grandeur sight that brought wonder on the richness of the history of South Korea. Pleasant place to roam around, beautiful architecture to the detailing work on ceiling, tiles, roof-tops and more. Relaxing and beautiful connecting garden and lake. We enjoyed photo-takings, strolling with family and learning a little bit of history."
25,5.0,This palace connected ti changdeokgung palace and this palace big enough like gyeongbokgung and in here you can take alot of picture too like in another palace
26,4.0,"We bought the palace combination ticket and this one was in the 4 palaces on the ticket.nearest train station is Hyehwa. Takes about 15-20 min from the station to the palace so do plan your time. We went for the English guided tour. Think it's very recommended as you get to know the sad history of the place and where some of the events happened. We went in the late afternoon time. The place was quiet. Only a few visitors. It was nice and a refreshing change from being in crowded spaces. It was nice to walk around the garden and admire the buildings despite its past history being somewhat sad. One thing to note : there's only 1 public toilet area on the palace grounds which is some 200m away from the entrance (inside the grounds) , if you are urgent... It's abit difficult! We were there in winter, the path to the toilet was icy and snowy, slippery and wet. It was a difficult 200m! But on the whole, I really liked this palace. It had a certain feel to it. Can't describe it but alluring."
27,4.0,"It is better to buy the Combination ticket that costs W10,000 and gives admission to 5 sites and Secret Garden. When we arrived, we were greeted by a volunteer guide. She took us around the palace, explaining the features and history of the palace and telling us stories about the Japanese attempts to erode the Korean legacy during the Colonial period.After the guided tour, you are free to roam around the palace ground. There is a gate to the Changdeokgung at the back of the palace. This gate is near the entrance to Changdeokgung's Secret Garden entrance."
28,5.0,"This temple bring to you peace, relaxing and special effects, everything looks so beautiful and you can feel the peace"
29,4.0,Not sure if free entry with Hanbook wear as i never try wear the hanbook for here. quite historical place. Need additional entry fee for secret garden as only allow 100 visitor per time. there are time to get in the secret garden. Never go in as need wait quite long time.
30,4.0,"It's a lot smaller than the Gyeongbokgung Palace, making it easier to explore. It's definitely worth seeing if it's your first time in Korea."
31,5.0,If you wanted to know more about Korea and their culture then this is the place to be. They offer guided tours but they also have the app on which you could follow through the whole area.
32,3.0,"This was nice to see, but the site did not meet my expectations.  Additionally, the extra money for the secret garden was not worth it in my opinion.  Afterwards, do walk around the neighborhoods, where there are nice crafts stores, restaurants, and artists."
33,4.0,"It is possible visiting the palace only with a guide and there is only some hours for the english guide, so it's better to inform about the hours unless you are korean speaking. It is worth a visit , so suggestive and exciting even with kids ( good walker kids!) , it is full of garden and trees so even in the summer it is pleasant to walk in."
34,5.0,"The Palace is quite big. Get there at the changing of the guards, it's worth it. We walked along the walkway leading to the Palace and saw a K-Pop group filming. Fun."
35,3.0,The Palace is like all other average palaces and venues in seoul. Maybe we went little late in our trip so did not find much attraction. There are some parts with some historical importance and a huge park for walking. Little expensive for tourists.
36,4.0,"Beautiful buildings and rich heritage, good way to learn about the culture and custom of S Korea, very interesting"
37,5.0,We couldn't wait 3 hours to get into Secret garden which was separate admission fee and time. Otherwise very reasonable admission price. Palace grounds are smaller than other palace nearby. Separate buildings house administrative govt and king. Good historical sight in middle of city.
38,5.0,"One of the best Korean traditional palace. In this palace, flowers and trees are very beautiful especially in spring and autumn. Especially around Biwon, about 20~30 minutes from the main gate has stunning view and I think this place is one of the most beautiful place in Seoul. Definitely worth a visit."
39,4.0,Family with a baby we enjoyed the beauty and stroll around the garden.  We did the English tour and enjoyed our tour guide.  We came in the early spring.
40,5.0,This palace is the most quiet one among the five major palaces. Not as crowded as Changdeokgung Palace. My sister and I were the only people there when we visited this place.
41,4.0,It is the biggest and the most beautiful palace.  The main gate is great also.  The roofs inside are painted in unique style with colorful colors and designs.  All the buildings are in good conditions along long walk ways.
42,4.0,Get to understand the culture of Korea and know this place in more details. Weather is too cold and we did not move around much.
43,4.0,i can say that this is the most silent palace among the five as you will have time to appreciate the palace because it is so serene.  There are very less people when we came here in the afternoon and we had a lot of time to appreciate the palace.
44,4.0,"This palace is right behind Changdeokgung, and if you're already there, it's worth the visit. It has a pleasant park, with a lake and lots of trees. Really peaceful and serene. Loved it.If you come from Changdeokgung, you descend a gentle slope towards the gardens. There are nice stones along the slope. You can also the Changgyeonggung palace below.The buildings themselves seemed to us just like the other palaces, so I would come there just for the park."
