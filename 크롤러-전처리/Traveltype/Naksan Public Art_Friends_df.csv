0,3.0,"It was very disappointing to find out that the stairs with fish and mosaic flowers were painted over with grey paint. The remaining murals are OK but not worth all the hassle that is required to get there. If you however want to go there let me give you detailed instructions. Go to Dongdaemun station. From exit 10 head straight for approx 30m till you see a bus stop with a bright green ""03"" bus number on it. It will be a small green bus and Naksan Park is the last stop (do not freak out when bus driver will make a loop just at the bus entrance). Then, when facing the park you'll have entrances on left and right - go right if you want to get a paper map. If you chose this entrance, walk approx 30 metres towards the park until you will see wooden stairs (with green stripes on the steps) leading down. Take the stairs (two sets of them) and head left. Within few steps you will see a path leading straight and an U-turn. Take the U-turn (you will see a metal installation of a man and a dog). After few steps you will find a little pub/cafe called Jazz Story. They have paper maps of the murals and toilets! Once you have a map you can find your way round (you have to walk the U-turn back). The bus stop is also marked on the map."

I drained my energy to walk to this attraction because it's on the top of a hill and you must walk (or climb?) for about 30-40 mins from the nearest subway station. This place is actually famous for its mural village (Ihwa Mural Village) which used in many dramas as shooting location, but if you're not a drama lover than this place is just no other than a place which got some murals on the walls. If you have much time in Seoul, maybe you can visit here for some sightseeing. But if you only have limited time, this place is actually not really worth it.P.S this place looks much better in picture :p"
2,5.0,Nice pictures to be taken and there weren't that many people so the lines weren't that long. The walk to the public art along the Seoul wall is very nice and calming as well. It's a must do!
3,5.0,"One thing for sure, to find the place is easy, if you read the direction map carefully! I thanked for a review in Trip Advisor that gave me the clear direction. Went here a couple months a go, and the feeling of post-visit is still here. I'm amazed on how those art works put places in this village. Definitely the right place to strike poses! Try explore the places a bit further, and you might get different art works that you've seen in internet."
