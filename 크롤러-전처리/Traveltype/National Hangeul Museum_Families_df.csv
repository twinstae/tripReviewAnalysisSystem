0,5.0,"Hangeul has long been recognized as one of the most rational and logical alohabets by linguists. Well, Korea did well in building a grand building highlighting what is a true jewel of Korean culture. The building is new and the exhibition design is successful in telling the story of Hangeul. From traditional to state of the art exhibition tools, the museum is very visual.  I wish there were more accompanying english texts but there are 2 english tours every Wednesday at 2 and 3pm.There are great playrooms and interactive rooms for young kids.Go, you will be satiated. It helps that the grounds adjoining the National Museum of Korea is so lush. A visit is a refreshing escape from the din of the metropolis."
1,3.0,"We included this museum on our visit list with the hopes of learning more about the Korean language origins and use.  The introductory video welcoming visitors was quite interesting about how the language was created by a king for the Korean people.  We saw lots of well organized displays, however, it was a little difficult for us to understand their context as they were mainly presented in Korean.  We did find the interactive computer room the most helpful with one teaching how to properly write Hangul and another allowed us to create a selfie with the Hangul characters.  We spent less than one hour here and was a bit disappointed with the outcome for us."
2,3.0,"The exhibits are very well done, visually stimulating and informative. It is a small museum so suggest you plan this as a side trip immediately before or after the National Museum (which is awesome!) which is right next door."
3,4.0,The National Hangeul Museum is a wise investment made by South Korea. I observed a lot of Korean families with their children getting them exposed to the origin of their language. They even have a separate building to serve as Family Lounge. The surrounding landscape is also well maintained.
4,3.0,"I visited with my niece as she is learning Korean in advance of moving here.  She found the museum fascinating and it made lots of sense to her.  For me with no knowledge of Korean it was slightly boring.  Only the basics was given in English so I didn't really learn a lot.  If you have the interest go, as it is on the grounds of the Korean National Museum you can fit it into your itinerary easily."
