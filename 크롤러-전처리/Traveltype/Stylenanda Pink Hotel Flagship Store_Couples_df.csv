0,5.0,The shop is very cute with lots of variety and the Pink Pool Cafe on the top floor is amazing! The decor is very fun and has lots of cool photo opportunities. I had an iced green tea and caramel croissant and both were delicious!
1,3.0,"Went to the one in Myeongdong, it was super crowded on the ground floor, but it was actually quite empty on the other floors (which sells the same cosmetics). Top floor was the rooftop area, not exactly clean, the pink and white pillows were kinda turning grey and no one was taking care of the finished drinks from previous customers. Blue cream soda was good tho."
2,4.0,"Never miss out this millennial pink store when you are around Myeongdong. Each level has their own unique concept (e.g., selling makeups and clothes). Do check out their pink pool cafe (and their rooftop) for insta-worthy photos!"
