0,3.0,". . . from which one can see the Banpo Bridge Rainbow as well as the changing lights on Some Sevit. Numerous folks were having picnics, while others were skate boarding or bicycling on a cool, June evening."
1,2.0,"We walked to the park from Gangnam station (~40min) and absolutely hated the entrance to the park through the dystopian looking underpass along the busy highway. The park itself is small and surrounded by heavy traffic, there is almost no vegetation and very little room to sit or walk. We went on a Thr afternoon and it was empty with only cyclists passing by. Even the building on Sebitseom were empty and partially closed. We ended up walking from Sebitseom to Dongjak bridge where we took the subway. It was definitely not what we expected and dod not provide a relaxing nature experience. It might be worth visiting at night for the night lights but could easily skip otherwise."
2,3.0,If you are bored strolling the crowded streets of downtown take the Metro Line 9 to Yeomchang Station and you can walk upstream along the river front first through Hangang and than through the Riverside park as far as to building 63.
3,4.0,The night view here is beautiful especially the lighted bridges. A good place to relax and picnic. Best to come in the evening to enjoy the night view.
4,5.0,Looking at the Hangang river to refresh the mind and think of inspiration. Walking and strolling down at Hangang park.
5,5.0,"It's where the locals go for a run, walk, picnic etc etc. Especially the Banpo Hangang park is one of the nicest areas amongst the others. The park is considered safe even at late at nights. It's a good walk if you happen to stay near by."
6,5.0,"One of the best parks in Seoul and maybe in megapolises of SEA. Very clean, peaceful and calm. So beautiful. There is a special line for cycling, probably as long as 70 km long, both sides of the river. On weekends always crowded, so I prefer weekday."
7,5.0,A very beautiful spot in Korea. You can do activities such as enjoying a bike ride. There are seats where you can relax. When we visited there are many flowers arranged so you can use for your photo op. I suggest you visit on weekdays and start to stroll early in the morning so you can enjoy the place best.  This park is free :)
8,5.0,"We went at night where the wind made it really cold.  We were dressed for 13 degree weather, but with the wind, it felt like 5 degrees.  So we were really cold.Great place to walk, enjoy the scenery, catch a movie.  But check weather and activity schedule ahead of time to make good use of your time."
9,4.0,"Seoul is a no no for drones.  Fortunately Hangang park provides a descent space to fly your drone. Search for ""hangang drone park"" for details."
10,5.0,"Despite going in a chilly spring breeze, this riverside park is absolutely delightful and a joy to visit! It stretches a fair distance if you like walking, and it's also great to ride a bike or skate. The ministop is great if you need a quick snack, drink or even ramen, and the view is absolutely beautiful. They also sell fried chicken and other street food if you're in the mood for a warm bite. I think the annual fireworks are even held there, which is great if you find yourself there at the same time. Amenities at the park also include sports facilities including basketball courts and fitness centers, The river is really clean too. The night light show is also worth checking out if you get the chance to!"
11,5.0,I LOVE THIS PLACE! My favorite part about my holiday in Seoul! Barely any tourist there! So relaxing. A great place for an evening stroll. They even have small shows & performance. Locals having picnics & riding bicycles.. My happy places. They even have water/bridge shows at night.
12,4.0,"We went to Hangang Park at night, we missed the lightshow, so there is not much to say about that. Hangang Park is a beatifull place to relax at at night."
13,4.0,"I've visited this park with my husband several times since we moved to Seoul 9 months ago and plan to continue going once our baby arrives this spring. It is a fabulous park that we find is always clean and well-maintained. The park has plenty of inexpensive parking and options for restrooms and refreshments throughout. The park itself is huge and spans quite a length of the Han river. I doubt you could see it all in a day. However, it's a lot of fun to spend time here on nice weather days. We like that there are separate walking and bike paths along the river - it means much less risk of getting flattened by bicyclists than other parks we have been to. There are also wonderful sweeping views of the city skyline to be seen from this park - bring your camera! We have also observed children's playgrounds, basketball courts, soccer fields, picnic pavilions, sculpture gardens, water sports and water taxis, waterfront dining, and other attractions at Hangang park. We would definitely recommend this park to fellow nature lovers."
14,4.0,We managed to catch sunset from the Han's river park. We walked along the bridge too. Good place for cycling and catching up with friends. Visited the area where they acted the Legend of the Blue Sea
15,5.0,Great place to watch the world go by. We bought snacks in the building and sat on the steps overlooking the bridge. It was a cool and shady place to relax.
16,5.0,Just in love! A favorite spot for hanging out or walking down the river side to watch the beautiful scene of Han River and everything around. Best time to enjoy the view is near the sunset time but it's good also in the evening with the city lights bright up the the surrounding.
17,4.0,"Like the Park very much, nice breeze and fresh air. Went during May so sun was pretty hot but the strong wind has help to relief the heat....  walk along the park all the way to the other end of the bridge. Spend a sweet afternoon with my husband there. Love it."
18,5.0,"In my opinion, this is the place to come if u are coming with your girlfriend..... a good place to hangout"
19,4.0,"There is a drone park there so we were visiting to try out the mavic iron albs. The weather was nice although it was cold Feb, i believe if you go during spring it must be much more beautiful to walk around."
20,4.0,"In the three-month summer holiday vacation, I travelled to Seoul, which is the capital of Korea. Korea is a country that gathers different kinds of culture. Except for the shopping malls to go, there is also a nice park in Seoul for people to visit which is called Hangang Park. Actually, when I am on the subway, sometimes it will pass on the river, it is really beautiful. This time we go to Hangang Park to have a look. As we entered the park, it is full of local people or tourists. The greenish area there is quite large. You can see many people doing different sports there. Like riding a bicycle, playing football swimming and so on. I have a picnic with my friends sitting on the grass. I enjoy the sunshine and fresh air there. It makes me comfortable. I recommend that the people who want to have a picnic there can prepare more things."
21,4.0,"It can be a really nice pause from all the sightseeing. You can hire a bike for free (for expample near Oksu or Eungbong station) for 3 hours or 1-2 hours during summer (you leave your ID). You can also hire a bike for a whole day for 15000 W. There is a bike path near the river so you can admire Seoul from the other perspective. There are a lot of 'gyms' and places to play basketball on the way. You can also see the unusual fountain from the banpo bridge (at certain hours, the best at the evening with lights and music)."
22,4.0,"We came here in the evening during the weekend. It was nice to walk around and be near the water. There are people playing music, riding the bike, having a picnic, and skateboarding. We had a good time getting a little rice cake dish near by the station and eating and walking around the park. Next time, we want to rent a bike and ride for a little while."
23,4.0,"Seoul has really put together some wonderful places for the residents to get out of the urban concrete highrise filled dongs and back to nature, and Hangang Park is one of the great ones. We visited at night, pre Eland Cruise, and it looked like a place that would be a go-to weekend destination of mine if I were to live in Seoul. Walking and biking paths along the Riverside, a beautifully sloped grassy rise perfect for picnicking with views of the Seoul skyline, it was very nice and seemingly much appreciated  by the locals as many were out enjoying the evening- mostly couples naturally.  Is it a tourist destination? Not so much if you have limited time in Seoul but if you are going to the river cruise, building 63, or even the huge wet market it is worth taking an extra 1/2 hour to go stop by for a visit!"
24,5.0,"This was one of my top activities in Seoul!  What a great way to get out of the chaos of the city and walk, run, cycle or just hangout by the river.  There are lots of open green spaces and outdoor fitness areas.  What I like in particular are the separate paths for walkers/runners and cyclists.  Along the path are several gateways that will allow you to enter/exit the park.  Due to the proximity of the Gangnam neighborhood, you can easily explore the shops and cafes of Sinsa-dong Garosu-gil."
25,4.0,"Lovely place for couples and families. Spotted many families and friends gathering for picnics, camping, various sports (baseball, running, cycling, usage of fitness machines). I enjoyed the night ferry cruise from Jamsil Dock that went to Banpo Bridge (8pm rainbow fountain ""show"")."
26,4.0,I go here in the night and so cold and also so windy maybe it will be nice if i go here in the morning or afternoon.
27,5.0,"It was first time visiting there. Due to the fact that it was Wednesday night, there were not so many people as expected. Im sure that there will be no space during weekends. Its really nice to go out and grab some unique street food. The food around there is quite costy compare to just normal ones, but the stakes there are pretty nice (8,000₩-10,000₩)Park was a lot cleaner than expectation and the cool breeze was enjoyable."
28,4.0,"Yeouido Hangang Park is the best place to chill. A lot of locals come here with their couple and families especially at night. Plenty of things to do like riding bicycles, river cruising, watching street performances, having picnics or just taking a stroll along the river. The closest metro station is Yeouinaru and there's plenty of convenient stores to grab a snack."
29,3.0,It is very far from metro station about 1.2km and 20 mins walk. Check the fountain schedule and plan you trip allow extra travel time. We had been there during the night and couldn't tell the view during the day.
30,3.0,"Not the easiest place to visit, but sure worth it. I can recommend to rent a bicycle and take a drive along the river. It is fun."
31,3.0,"This park in the Gangnam district of Seoul is on the Han river. There are a few cafes and shops in 2 large glass buildings, and other than that there's the bridge across and not much else.Nice for a stroll if you happen to be in the area, or for some cycling, but if you're on a tight schedule you can safely give this one a miss."
32,4.0,"Great view, perfect for a bike ride. Walking can be nice too, however, it's not a 'real' break from the city, the air quality is still bad so people should be careful spending too much time in the area without wearing a mask."
33,3.0,We came to the park hoping to see cherry blossom unfortunately we miss the season already... yet we have our time there sitting on a bench and enjoying the moments we have :)
34,3.0,"The Han River Park is a popular spot to escape the city, but I always feel it could be so much better. It's great that Seoul has such a large park running along both banks of its river - few cities do - but the facilities are poor."
35,5.0,"Visited the stretch of the park in Ichon, near the National Museum. Spent a relaxed late afternoon here, in the shade of a rest shed, with a view of the well-manicured eulalia grass fronting the Han. Bicycle tracks line the edge of the park. Plenty of open green space for dog-walking or just chilling out. I came with guests from a friend's wedding, and we had a chimaek (fried chicken + beer) picnic, thanks to Seoul's relaxed open container laws."
36,5.0,"What a relaxing way to spend a day. We took a 45 minute boat ride down the Han River, then lunch at the boat launch. I would split up my trip with a day here to unwind and view the great scenery"
37,4.0,Nice view of the Hangang. Must by Ramen from convenience store and eat with the Hangang view. Great for a leisure afternoon. There are bicycles rental too!
38,4.0,"As I'm overlooking the park daily from home I can only recommend to visit the park.There are sooo many activities one can do, there will be one for you.During the cherry  blossom season the Yeoido island section is good, near Ichon the basketball courts, rollerskating tracks,  bicycle renting place, waterskying centre, soccer and camping grounds, sailing school and all Korean sports grounds are well visited from spring till autumn. Throughout the year the place is well visited for cycling and walking. The endless cycling paths at both sides of the Han-river give you plenty of opportunities and all are well maintained. Various location provide open air swimming pools  in summer. Also evenings along the river shall not be forgotten such as cruises on the river from Yeoido to the fountains of Banpo bridge or a simple picnic (don't forget the chicken and soju) anywhere along the river."
39,5.0,Hangang Park is definitely the best place for couples and to do tandeum bike riding. We were extremely lucky to have perfect clear weather while we were there. My partner and i enjoyed cycling along the Han river and admiring the awesome view it has got to offer. Definitely one of the best memories made from our trip in Korea.
40,4.0,"This is a lovely park with fantastic views of the Seoul skyline, but maybe plan to go in summer. This past weekend was too cold to be out long enough to enjoy it!"
41,4.0,Nice view over Seoul skyline. Very calm and quiet by the bank of the river. Floating artificial island nearby. Superb water show Apr/Oct. Very nice walk.
42,3.0,"Not easy to get here. Good for a stroll in warmer times... I have been here in the summer and it is a great area to spend a day picnicking, swimming in the pools, jogging, walking around, etc. Walk to the colourful water bridge in the evenings... but in the winter months is is fairly dull and lifeless..."
43,4.0,"Even thought it was winter, we can go on the cruise and sailing on hangang river. The tour guide gave the Information in 3 languages: korea, chinese, and english. So no worry about the language. It is a good experience seeing so many things during the river trip. The park is also beautiful, some people were playing kite on the afternoon."
44,4.0,"Visited here with my boyfriend. There wasn't much people when we visited, so we are able to enjoy the scenery and the cold wind. While taking a walk around the park, we noticed some youngsters riding bicycles, skateboarding, rollerblading, etc. There are also couples and families. Convenient stores and cafe are nearby the park. It is nice to have a warm or hot drink in this cold weather after a walk. Must visit this park once when you are in Korea. To get here, you can take the subway and alight at Yeouinaru station (여의나루역), exit 2. Walk out of the station and the park is at the right hand side."
45,5.0,"Went there in the evening, plenty of couples and families there. Enjoyed the scenery at night & definitely worth a visit"
46,5.0,"Hangang Park is a beautiful oasis in Seoul, you feel like in a different world. Considering Seoul is such a huge and busy city this park is really like an oasis. You can go for a stroll, have a coffee at the floating island, rent a bike and just enjoy the day. The park is definitely worth a visit."
47,5.0,"Rent the bicycles & enjoy the ride along the riverfront. Gorgeous view of the city. There are cruises from the pier but you must check their timings. If they don't have at least ten people, they will cancel the cruise."
48,4.0,A nice place to go when you want to escape the beautiful madness of Gangnam or Myeondong.  It's great for picnics or to just go walking.  The current trend (2015) is to head there in the evening with friends or a date and have fried chicken and beer.
49,5.0,"My favorite place to be when in Seoul! Great views, happy atmosphere, excellent for both spontaneous or planned picnic."
50,3.0,"Lovely views across the river but not many facilities, the only cafe we passed was closed. Did enjoy the free exercise area."
51,4.0,"Wonderful park to walk around in. We found an outdoor rock climbing wall, bike paths, cafes and restaurants and a campground off the river. The tents were reasonably priced (free WiFi was also available for the campers) and a bbq area and coffee shop. A great place to stroll by the river, relax, picnic or camp!"
52,3.0,You can spend a relaxing time walking along Hangang Park.The best time for walking the park would be spring as you can admire the flowers planted along the sides of the parks
53,4.0,"This is rather a long stretch of green place with all the facilities suitable for the young and old to hang out, relax and exercise. You would realise cycling is rather popular as lots of cyclists can be seen even on a hot summer. If you are travelling and wish to get away from the city, this is one of the places to consider."
54,4.0,"not much to see, but the garden with river view and city view couldn't nice without boat tour. so you must jump to the boat and get the tour. it is nice."
55,5.0,You can rent bikes to ride on the 50km of trail or relax and enjoy the view of the water.  Its very romantic after dark.  Its very safe too.
56,5.0,The park is located in the middle of the city. It is a perfect spot for families and couple to have a picnic and leisure activities such as cycling. Most people are here with chicken and beer for gatherings. Good place to chill and relax. Plenty of chicken and beer stalls.
57,4.0,"Just nice, but the ubiquitous piped music is too much, especially at the volume at which it is played near the ferry departure points.  Don't bother taking the ferry trip.  It is too short and commentary is rubbish.  Also very tacky.  You'll get the same views and photos from the water's edge."
58,5.0,"This park has many interesting features. Except being park itself, two big landmarks can be found there. First is Rainbow fountain. Check show times, there are not that many. Show lasts for about 20 minutes. It's not very colorful with naked eye though. Second interesting places is floating islands. Impressive example of modern architechure of organic design. They really make you say ""Wow!"". Fantastic views after sunset. On island themselves there is pretty much nothing except couple of cafes and one small souvenir shop. Floating islands are must see!"
59,3.0,"There are multiple Parks by the Hangang river ... hence, the review will vary according to the Park visited/ passed by..."
60,5.0,"I love this park. The scenery is peaceful and serene. You can have a date by riding a couple bicycle, rollerblading, picnic, dip our feet in a cold stream, playong kites, eat ramyun and enjoy a live band."
61,5.0,"The park is the site of many Hangang attractions, including the Banpo Moonlight Rainbow Fountain, Moonlight Square and 3 , floating islets. The rainbow colored fountain composed of 200 lights, unfolds on both sides of the bridge, which is 570m long. With the fountain's total length reaching 1140m when both sides are included, the fountain is recognized by the Guiness Book of World Records as the world's longest bridge fountain. The fountain's water jets are dynamic and can moved in time to music creating spectacular ever changing displays. We  visited on a Saturday and there was also a display of fireworks, lighting up the sky. We could also see N Seoul tower from where we were seated.  Then we proceeded to visit the 3 floating islets which was brightly lighted up. There are many restaurants , cafes and a  souvenir shop"
62,4.0,"There are a few parks along the river to choose from, with Yeouido Park and Banpo Park being two of the most popular.  You can rent a basketball, a bike, set up a tent or simply walk around enjoying the river.  It's beautiful at night as well.  Lots of couples and families walking around when the weather is nice.  Just be prepared, sometimes it can smell awful, like the day we went."
63,5.0,nice sunset and beautiful view of the hangangdisliked the crowds along the row of sakura trees though
64,5.0,"The most famous area is Bampo but there's so much more to discover and enjoy. There are cycling (rental shops in several locations) and walking paths along the river and tributaries. There's also outdoor exercising equipment, football fields, inline skating spots and so much more. It's more enjoyable on week days since it can get crowded on weekends when the weather is nice and people bring tents, tables and chairs for picnicking."

70,5.0,"a great place in any season and any time of day or night,picnic, swimming pool,cycling, cafes, recommend it!"
71,4.0,"Enjoyed watching the fountain show and listening to music. Had a nice evening walk there. A bit distant though, and there were no cafes or restaurants nearby."
72,5.0,"This park basically gets a lot of nice view, especially at nite. If u wanna see more beauties of this river, I recommend u take the tour boat and enjoy the view there. Btw, it's good to go there at evening or nite."
73,4.0,Went here for the October Fireworks extravaganza. It was cheek-to-jowl! 2 hrs before we got a small place on an embankment. 7.30pm fireworks were awesome from the park. We loved it and left 08.45 pm. It was Very dangerous though with police having great difficulty channeling thousand of people across narrow bridges. It was scary. I can imagine a real problem and serious accident here if things do not improve....
74,5.0,This park is great for walking around or to relax at one of the benches. Bike rental available at reasonable price. The park has a biking track. The roads are flat and easy to bike. Enjoy the view on the Han river. Hawkers and small 7-11 around the park for refreshments after a long walk or bike track.
75,4.0,"Easy to access, and has a beautiful view of the river.  The park is well kept, clean and a lot of fun.Bikes and Tandem bikes are up for rent at cheap rates (3,000 won per hour for a single bike) and make for a great way to explore quickly.The playground included a lot of interesting installations which even I had fun playing.  All in all, a great place to have a picnic, enjoy a Monday (because everything else is closed), and have a blast."
76,5.0,We rented bikes (US$25 for 2 bikes for 3 hours) and road 18 miles. We could have gone much further on the dedicated bike paths. We highly recommend this!
77,5.0,"This park provides a stunning view of the city from the river side (Han river). There are trails and the only bicycle road in Seoul. It stretches several kilometres, but there are facilities at your disposal at regular intervals. Also drinking water fountains and some 7-elevens will be on the way.We rented a tandem bike close to Yeouinaru station, line 5, exit 2 and walk straight for 2-3 minutes. The price was 6000 for the first hour and then 1000 for every additional 15 minutes. Half the price for a regular bike."
78,4.0,"There is a beautiful path along the Han River, a walk of about 45 minutes. I was very fascinated to this fantastic place as they have been able to exploit this park and the river itself. A pleasant walk watching all those people playing sports and outdoor activities. All in all it worth a stroll through it."
79,5.0,"Great view on the city and a nice way to ""go out of the city"". Even though you're in the middle of Seoul, it feels fresh and nice there. The park is actually the area next to the main river of Seoul (Han River). You can access to Han River by a lot of places but the most famous one is probably Yeouido (Yeouinaru Station, line number 5). You can also go to Ttukseom Resort if you are in this area.There, you can just have a walk, ride a bike or even do some camping! Koreans love to go there with their friends, order some chicken (the delivery guy will come next to the river!), sit on the grass and just chill. Usually I like to go there by bike and just enjoy a nice ride. There are a lot of places where you can rent a bike. You'll need to leave an ID and pay 3000won for the first hour. Then if you return your bike after more than one hour, it will cost you 500won per 15 minutes. You can also cross most of the bridges with your bike. On the side, they have specific bike lanes, the view from there is amazing. I particularly recommend to cross Mapo Bridge or Sogang Bridge.If you go untill the Banpo bridge, you can see the Rainbow Fountain show. The schedule is as follow :* Weekdays: 12:00, 20:00, 21:00 * Weekends: 12:00, 17:00, 19:30 (July & August only), 20:00, 20:30, 21:00, 21:30"
80,4.0,"The parks along Seoul's Hangang are a great place to relax. The Hangang park in reality is a collection of areas all along the river Han. My favourite spot is the one accessed from Ttukseom Resort subway station (exit 2 or 3). It is nice in all seasons and from here I saw an amazing sunset in winter however in summer it transforms into an activity hub. All facilities are easily located near the station. Just outside the station you can find a bicycle rental place (you just need to leave an ID at the counter, pay the first hour: 3000 won, and then 500 won for every additional half hour when you return the bike) with the bike you can then cycle on the well maintained cycle path all along the river. It is a nice way to see the city from the river. Here you will also find an outdoor climbing wall, a skate park with ramps, and a number of watersports (wakeboarding/water skiing, windsurfing, kitesurfing, SUP). There is also a swimming pool which should be open from June onwards. It is quieter during the week; if you go on a sunny weekend it is better to go in the morning as it can get quite busy. The Hangang park in Yeouido instead is the place to go for the cherry blossom in spring."
81,5.0,"Has been here twice and yet still stunning with the nice atmosphere surrounding. An area full of young people and couples spent time together camping on the park, jogging, cycling, and near to ferry cruise to sightseeing beautiful Seoul from Han river especially at night."
82,4.0,"If you have got some time to kill in Seoul and want a nice place to relax in the sun, then check out Hangang park in the spring, summer or Autumn. There are large grassy areas to sit on, a stream and a large pond which is interactive public art you are allowed to swim in, and bicycle paths and bicycles for hire. Once you have had enough of the park, you can head to Building 63 (aka City 63) and get a birds eye view of the city. More info and lots of pictures in my blog.http://gdaykorea.blogspot.kr/2014/05/seoul-hanggang-park-bicycles-building-63.html"
83,3.0,"It is not so much a park but a long promenade along the shore of the Hangang river.  It would be nice day out if weather is fine.  Frankly speaking the view of the two sides of the river and the bridges spanning across the river are not very spectacular and also there are not many facilities such as cafes, viewing points, pavillion, shops that you can rest during the walk.  Could be quite dusty when there is strong wind.  Felt that the park is half-finished and facilities can be improved.  Quite some locals have picnic or lunch or running there as weather was good and cool at the time I visited.  There are bikes for rental and this may be a better idea if you wish to finish the whole path."
84,5.0,"away from the city is a long walk along the han river.We wanted to try the cafe there. We thought it was a proper restaurant for dinner, but it was normal cafe with good view, ended we didn't try.but the view was amazing."
85,5.0,"Following along the bank of the Han River, this park offers ample activities for the fitness inclined. Spring is the best time to visit. After the biting cold of winter and preceeding the sweaty heat of summer, springtime invites Seoulites of all ages out to enjoy the sunshine. Families and couples picnic on the grass, while Ajumas and Ajashis exercise on the myriad machines underneath the highway. The smooth, level path entices cyclists to ride down its length, rain or shine. All in all, a very enjoyable experience, particularly on a warm spring day."
86,4.0,Oh ! Wonderful day for me .  I hope will comeback comming soon . I love korea and nature frome korea .
87,4.0,"Personally, i like to go here in the fall when its not so crowded during the week, the weekends is always a popular place for everyone to gather. There are miles and miles of bike trails and if you are into biking than this is the place for you, bike rental places are all over the place and you can rent by the hour and time flies when you start to bike along the river. If you prefer to walk there are alot of trails that take you close to the river and great place for couples to take pictures and families to bring a mat and have a picnic. Its relaxing and enjoyable but spring and summer are really crowded so pick and choose the time to go. I have never been at night so i dont know how it changes but during the day until sunset is a great place for a place to chill and take a breather!!"
88,5.0,"My husband and I love this park!  We rented a tandem bike for $6,000 won per hour and rode along the Hangang River.  It was a great way to see the city and give our exhausted feet a rest.  A plus is that the back person on the tandem bike can also take photos! The rental bike shop if off the Bundang Line, exit 2 (note that this line may not be in the old metro map).  There are gardens, outside gyms, volleyball courts, bat mitten nets, a rock climbing wall facility, a roller skate park, and convenient stores along the bike path.  We enjoyed the breeze, watching the locals, and stopping along the way to soak in the scenery.  Highly recommended!!! Even if you don't like biking, I would recommend that you check out the park for its facilities (fountains, playgrounds, deer zoo, etc)."

There are also no places to rent a bike, or even sit in the shade, but it's a pleasant park, very clean, there is exercising equipment, and you can walk/jog/bike a decent distance without going in circles."

At nighttime it was nice to see all the Korean couples holding hands (Koreans seem more romantic than Americans, constantly holding hands but never making out) walking along the trail, and during the day it was nice to see school groups."
