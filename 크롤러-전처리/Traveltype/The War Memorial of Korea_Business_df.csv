10,5.0,"This is arguably one of the best war memorials in the world, there are memorials for every country, and service person who lost their lives during the Korean War. My favourite display was the 3D theatre showing the history of the Korean War which is told from the perspective of an old man, who’s statue sits in the front row. It’s haunting, particularly given how close they are again to the brink of war."

12,5.0,So much to see here and a wonderful memorial to all the hero’s. We spent half a day here and could have spent so much more. It is always nice to take time to thank those who have given their lives so we may be free.

As an example,us lost of man,Turkey lost 894 man and luxemburg lost 1 man .But the section in museum is same and equal for all."

20,5.0,"Being a war buff, this was a really cool museum to visit. I loved the dioramas that were on display as it really gave you a feel of how it would have been during the Korean war. What a great tribute to the fallen too!Good on Seoul to have such a memorial - if I was a local, it would surely instill a sense a strong national pride in me!"
21,5.0,definitely worth a visit for photos and to take in the charming environment. the war museum should be visited showcasing the Korean war and its aftermath.
22,4.0,Learned so much more than I thought I knew. The appreciation they illustrate throughout the museum is truly incredible. The amount of suffering they went through was equally incredible.
23,4.0,"Normal, pretty much what you'd expect, but then the anti-Trump gang came by.  The anti-America came up as a surprise, but didn't deter to the tour...  Mostly, those in the tour (Can, Swe, Aus, Nze, Mex) all LOVED the tour and America.  I'd go right back to again learn even more...well worth the time, excellent time spent by my family of seven!"
24,4.0,"As a long time history buff, I love to see military relics from various times.This place has it all.From a B52 bomber and a Russian Mig to helicopters and Chinese and American tanks, this is the place to see.Missiles and artillery round out the showcase with a boat to tour as well.It was cold and brisk for us but the onsite coffee and snack building is perfect to offset.If looking for buses don't worry.... there is a bus stop that taxis and buses stop frequently right in front of the entrance!Kids have a small playground to play on as well."
25,5.0,Lots of content on the 1950-53 Korean war--very informative for westerners. Other wars covered as well.  Very moving!
26,5.0,Don't know much about the Korean War...You definitely must visit this Memorial.  It is full of archival footage of a terrible time in the history of this wonderful country.  It is nicely set up and easy to follow all the displays.  You must see it for yourself.
27,5.0,"Lots of history here, and not just what we Westerners call ""the"" Korean war.Well laid out exhibitions, and something for every nerd.A little heavy handed on the ""we wuz robbed"" view of history, with plucky Korea continually being buffeted by ill-thinking foreigners.  Then again, I guess that isn't so far from the truth."
28,5.0,"We had nice visit to this memorial, know more about the war between the north & south Korea a half century before. Many war weapons. Good chance to learn about the war."
29,4.0,"A good place to enjoy Korean history.  Some real models of old war machine: ariplanes, tanks, APCs, cannons, etc.  Best of all, it is free of charge."
30,4.0,"I took the free English tour of the museum. Our guide was a little hard to understand but having her show us around was invaluable. One my own, I wouldn't have stopped to watch the short films, but I found them to be great at explaining the war and I am glad they were part of the tour. The guide mentioned several times how the UN soldiers saved S. Korea from the North and the gratitude and appreciation to the soldiers who fought for a country they didn't know was truly humbling."
31,3.0,This is a large enough museum to spend a couple of hours at least. There are displays of the weapons and equipment from the war as well as a chronology of the three years of conflict. The signage is in English so I had no trouble with the information on any of the displays. I did find it interesting that it is definitely from a Korean point of view. A few times it seemed like the Koreans had just invited NATO along for the ride as they won the war! It is a must see for anyone interested in war history.
32,5.0,"I thought the memorial was about only the Korean War in the '50s, however, it is about all the wars Korea was envolver in. Very interesting to know the Korean history, specially how the country overcame all the difficulties and become a developed country. Amazing."
33,5.0,Beautiful location and so much to soak in and learn. A must see if visiting Seoul. The staff was so nice and wanted to help!
34,4.0,"A beautiful military history museum adjacent to the US military compound near Itewon, Seoul.  The museum is free.  Outside are many displays of military aircraft, ships, and armaments.  Inside are various displays of Korean military history to include the Turtle Ship.  The Korean War section is elaborate and in depth.  Harry Truman made the right decision to defend South Korea. A legacy we are still living today."
35,5.0,"... least this is what they claim, Really huge, with most modern technologies for visitors equipped. Shows highlights of the last 1000 years of wars in Korea."
36,5.0,We visited this Memorial on a Saturday morning. It took us about 2 hours to go through it. It was so amazing and informative.
37,5.0,"If you are a history buff, this memorial traces Korea's military past, all the way through modern times. It is a huge facility so make plenty of time and bring comfortable shoes."
38,5.0,In short ~ outstanding ~ highly recommend. Covers war Plus history and has best selection of planes from war and all the rest including memorial to brave souls whom scarified their lives so Korea is peaceful today
39,5.0,"The Memorial is in front of the Korean War Museum and a static display of vehicles, planes, tanks and even a boat. The museum provides in-depth information and displays about the Korea War. A must see for anyone visiting Seoul."
40,4.0,"I didn't realize that the museum has displays for the entire history of the Korean Peninsula. I spent 4 or so hours wandering the halls. It's a solemn experience. But it's also a must see to anyone visiting Seoul. The exterior displays are military hardware from the last 75 years. Planes, boats, tanks. Most are available for touch. I'm happy I had a chance to visit. I recommend to anyone interested in korean history."
41,3.0,"Interesting museum to visit. Depends on what interests you have, I was mainly interested in military aviation. The museum is in three floors and on each floor there are several exhibition rooms. Many exhibits are explained in  English language and there are film presentations on some topics, but these I missed, they all started on the hour. Provides insight to the Korean War and plenty of US material. Outside there is a display of various military aircraft used in Korea. The largest is the B-52 bomber, then there is the Phantom, MIG-19, AN2, small Cessnas etc. You can climb steps to see into the aircraft cockpit on most aircraft on display, including the B-52. I suggest you reserve 1,5 to 2 hours to go through everything at a reasonably quick pace."
42,5.0,"Visiting the war memorial of Korea is a great oppotunity to learn all about the history of Korea, the well known war and it's results on the present. Very interesting and informative."
43,5.0,"I visited the War Museum, in Seoul, Korea, and I would highly recommend any tourist that is traveling to South Korea this spring, to include the War Museum, in Seoul, as one of your highlight sites to visit. I went in the month of May, and it was absolutely beautiful!  With their weather warming up in the month of May, and all the beautiful flowers in bloom,  it was spectacular! You are able to walk around the outside gardens and water ponds, and tour the old war planes, and the battleship, and the submarine, in the out doors, and then go into the inside of the war museum, and learn alot about the history behind the Korean War. Take time to visit the simulator,and feel first hand, what it may have felt like to have been there. The temperatures in South Korea can be very cold during the winter months, and very hot during the summer months. However if you take a trip there during the springtime, or during the autumn months, you can really take advantage of the beautiful outdoor sites and wonderful weather, while enjoying the culture, and learning about the history, of one of the most beautiful cities in the world!!!"
44,4.0,Very informative museum with great displays of Korean wars from the past.  It's free--who can ask for more than that?!  Three floors x2.  Most everything in English as well as Korean.
45,5.0,"A well crafted and laid out museum, the War Memorial gives a thorough look at the young and violent history of Korea. Tons of stories and artifacts. Definitely a full day."
46,5.0,"I knew very little about the Korean war, but this museum tells you all you need to know. I was welcomed with an offer of a free English guide, very friendly. Museum is well made, text and animations, all in 2 languages."
47,3.0,"It was ok, but I have seen better memorials. This one seemed lacking and was mediocre. I guess it is worth seeing if you haven't but don't have high expectations."
48,5.0,"Wonderful balance of respect and weaponry. Sit under the wings of a B52, and see every piece of military hardware used in conflicts to keep the peace and make peace! Respect for those who have given their lives  for the country are beautifully presented in wonderful sculptures."
49,4.0,"The War Memorial of Korea provides guided tours with guides who were directly affected by the Korean War (1950-1953). The tour guides provide a unique perspective on the ""Forgotten War."" The controversial General MacArthur, who was removed by President Harry Truman, remains a hero in the minds of many Koreans who are alive today."
50,5.0,War memorial is a kind of war museum which exhibits war equipment and depicts the war field and related historical facts. War planes used during Korean are halted outside the memorial.
51,5.0,"Went here recently and it felt good to remember the sacrifices made to secure our generation's safety. Loved the vintage and historical cars, tanks and jets. :)"
52,5.0,"Entrance is free,three floors inside that have  very detailed history of the Korean war. Outside has lots to see including a F4 Phantom,a B52D,F101,Sabre, and lots more tanks,APC's and even a PT boat. Allow at least a full day"
53,4.0,Very interesting history of the Korean war and we'll as earlier battles. Recent conflict with North Korea also covered. Lots of original military equipment outside as well as huge war monuments around the memorial.
54,5.0,Very well arranged. The sculptures are magnificent! There's a large variety of weaponry on display from several wars. From a vintage patton tank to a B52 stratofortess to a scud missile and a small gun boat. It was a very interesting visit.I enjoyed it very much.
55,4.0,"My time there was made meaningful with a personal guide arranged by my travel agent.  Unfortunately, there were also other tour guides who had students and army boys there too and they were a bit noisy.  The place is a bit warm for me as it didn't seem to have air conditioning. They offered a free book about the war.  It was too heavy and thick and I didnt lug it back."
56,4.0,"The outside exhibits were great. Interesting, English available, and lots to see. The inside was harder, more ancient history than I was expecting, and too many school groups. (The kids do sit on the floor and pay attention to their guides though!) I'd plan to spend a hour or two here. Lots to learn."
57,5.0,"Our guide shared war and post-war experiences with Australian soldiers and his visits to Australia. A guided tour is the most efficient way to get an overview of the war. Spend 15-30min downstairs to get a quick overview of 4000+ years of Korean history at your own pace. Free book about the war available at front desk, plenty of ammenities (seem to be everywhere throughout Korea) also friendly and helpful staff. Not too crowded, we were there after lunch on a weekday."
58,5.0,After visiting the Memorial I am like most of the visitors would appreciate PEACE and FREEDOM more than ever. This Memorial is so well done that I get to learn so much about Korean history and not just war. We were very lucky to have a FREE GUIDED tour at 2pm (check information for time) which lasts for 1.5 hours. You do not have to be a historian or weapon fanatic to find this place a great way to spend 4-8 hours there.
59,5.0,"South Korea is shaped by its geography, in particular the Japanese occupation and Korean war and its aftermath. This museum traces the long history of Korea's kingdoms and invasions with a particular  focus on C20. It contains many moving memorials and reminders of the importance of international commitment to peace."
60,4.0,"I enjoyed my visit.  It has a lot of ""hardware"", such as tanks, planes, and even a patrol boat. But at the same time, the exhibits are very well organized. Some of the stories are also very touching.  It's free, and I think it is a must-see for first timer in Seoul."
61,5.0,This was an incredibly moving museum. The museum provided a very comprehensive overview of the Korean War. There are other exhibits providing a nice summary of ancient Korea history. I really enjoyed the exhibit and highly recommend it.
62,4.0,"We planned on spending just a couple of hours here not knowing that this memorial/museum had a lot to offer.  We spent most of our day here and hubby wanted to come back another day as we were not able to finish going through the whole building.  Wear comfortable walking shoes and eat first before coming here.  So much to see and learn and so little time!  Most moving exhibit for me was ""The Drop"" by Dong Man Kim."
63,4.0,"Not quite Smithsonian quality, but a really nice job nonetheless.  Sadly most of what I previously knew about the conflict came from watching the TV show M*A*S*H as a child.  I learned a lot about how it really went down.  Especially liked the patrol boat replica with all of its damage reproduced in detail.  Standing in the wheelhouse with all the bullet holes riddling the inside, I could literally feel the terror those sailors must've faced.The  B52 was also a highlight for me, though a little sad to see it deteriorating outside like that.Well done!!!  Go see it for sure."
64,5.0,I was very favorably impressed with the careful information and graphics provided in the museum about the Korean War(s). South Korea has gone through much since the 1950s (actually 1910 with Japan) and has recovered as a country with great culture and active development of very world competitive automobiles and technological products.
65,5.0,"I enjoyed the museum, lots of good info about the Korean War and a good variety of equipments on the show, highly recommended"
66,4.0,"Accessible, with tourists even the cold season, it helps you realize the history of Seoul and South Korea."
67,3.0,"If you're interested in Korean military history and its glorification, the place will definitely please you. Don't expect to see evidence of the horror that wars can cause."
68,5.0,"The museum is incredibly informative and well laid out. It caters for English speakers and is a fitting tribute to all those who fought as part of the UN coalition. The scale of the US contribution is staggering when you walk around the outside of the building and see all the names of those who died carved into the walls. Also impressive is the hardware parked outside. A real B52, a replica gunboat, tanks, helicopters, artillery etc. Can easily spend a day here."
69,4.0,"This modern museum fully captures the Korean, US and UN contributions to the Korean War. Exhibits are artful and informative. While most exhibits are presented in Hangul, many have English translation. English tour guides are also available."
70,5.0,A very well laid out and complete memorial. Could have spent a full day here but didn't have the time. A must see for any visit to Seoul.
71,5.0,"South Korea are a very proud nation and extremely proud of their armed forces; national service is still in place. A museum that tells a storey, the past and potentially the future, with thanks and praise to those countries who helped them during the invasion. Very good!"
72,5.0,"If you love history, you can spend a day in the war memorial. The memorial offers an english tour at 10 AM. Our tour guide was really good and explained the whole Korean war really well.  The tour is free."
73,5.0,"A great museum, well laid out and tells the fascinating story of the Korean War. We were lucky enough to be shown around by an English speaking volunteer who spent almost 2 hours with the 2 of us - and it was for free. Recommend this to anyone - just ask about the free guide"
74,5.0,"An expansive and very impressive memorial.  We spent 5 hours at the war memorial but could have spent more time.  There is an extensive outdoor display of aircraft (including a B52), tanks, missiles and a exact replica of a Korean patrol boat.In the time we had we focussed on the outdoor displays together with the 3 halls devoted to the Korean War.A MUST do when visiting Seoul."
75,5.0,"Been to a number of similar museums throughout the world, but this one is one of the best.  The place is enormous, you could spend an entire day here.  Free entry. Asked about English  guide thinking electronic device and had this young student Amanda take us around free of charge again.  Her knowledge and insights were amazing. A must see"
76,5.0,I recommend the War Memorial of Korea as a must-see on anyone's list of things to do.  The Memorial offers such an intense learning experience.
77,4.0,It is an interesting and informative institution to visit. A place full of Korean modern history. It show case the pain and suffering of the Korean people. One just wonders how mankind could destroy each other just over different ideology and influence. Friends and families were permanently separated. War is not an alternative to peace.
78,5.0,"I visited during May and there was a festival going on....families, kids, picnics.  Such a sight to see!  The museum and memorial was comprehensive, very informative and quite moving.  Go!"
79,5.0,Best War museum of the world........from the begiining of the Korean History to modern times. The outsiden exhibition of war-machines is of high quality.
80,5.0,A wonderful tribute to the people of Korea and the UN who assisted in protecting the people of the South from the invading. Makes you feel lucky to have not lived in such a treacherous time and environment.
81,4.0,"Is similar to other Memorial , but inside you feel immediately the sensation of how much is till actual the idea and the presence of the war in Korea . Very wide collection of aircraft . Not loose if you visit Seoul ."
82,4.0,"I went only because of the cherry blossom. But the way they respect their brave, it's a honourable site. It is next to a subway station and easily accessible."
83,2.0,Probably a must see but I was not really thrilled. Building is massive and you will go through the entire history of Korea through the wars that they fought since the origine of time. Very little translation in English so you get bored rapidly. There are some old military junk outside which probably will make kids happy.
84,5.0,"Be sure to make time and visit the War Memorial if Korea when you are in Seoul! The exhibits and tie in with the living history is outstanding, Allow at least 3 hours for a full visit."
85,5.0,"Spent a few hours at the museum.  Very educational, told the horrific story of the Korean War.  Well worth a visit."
86,5.0,Its the only war history memorial. Lots of details plus free so must not miss. I also got a free war history book that is excellent. Not much crowd in Sept. so my wife and I literally had the whole place to ourselves
87,5.0,"There are lots and lots of things to see here. Each of the huge pieces of art outside have a story to tell, and tell it well.I really enjoyed the display of planes, tanks, and a boat that have good explanations in English.The courtyard outside the main entrance has an amazing display of black obelisk-like pieces, one for each country that sent troops to aid in the war effort. From the U.S. with 36K+ dead, down to tiny Luxembourg which sent 85 soldiers (and lost 2) each piece has words in the country's native tongue honoring those who gave their lives in the fight.By the time I got inside, I was almost worn out. I only looked at a few of the displays there but, again, there were good explanations for the exhibits.For anyone remotely interested in history, this is a ""no-miss"" place!"
88,5.0,"If you love history, you would love this museum/memorial.  I went during the week, so it was more relaxing to read and study the art.  Just plan to be there a while...took me about 3 hours...because I read everything and Google things and I still missed some things. *smile*"
89,4.0,"Everyone should visit. Don't try to rush this experience. Also, summer and spring is the best time to go."
90,5.0,Nothing like seeing with your eyes .... It's like living history. I hate war memorials because glorify war ....but in Korea its their reality. Their country is still divided. Only seeing the mistakes of the past will keep us away from repeating them.A must !
91,5.0,"As a plane enthusiasts I was amazed thay you could get so close to touch, feel and see some of these awesome machines.If you have a spare couple of hours, then this place will educate you to the point that you will have a new found respect for the men and women who served."
92,5.0,"I could not believe this place was free, the war memorial is right next to the museum and you can spend hours inside that place. Highly recommend taking a trip to this area, but leave plenty of time to explore."
93,5.0,"I visited because I felt ""I had to"", but ended up staying much longer than expected. Very informative in an intelligent way, interesting architecture. I highly recommend."
94,5.0,"Intriguing, inspiring and totally worth it. Casts great insight into the regretful Korean war. One emerges from the visit feeling awed - and grateful."
95,4.0,Very informative and emotional history of the Korean War and the help it received from its Allies. highly reccommend a tour prior to visiting the DMZ and JSA. Puts everything in perspective.
96,4.0,The war memorial opened in 1994 on the former site of the army headquarters to exhibit and memorialize the military history of Korea.
97,4.0,"This is a great attraction if you want to learn more about the history of the Korean war. That exhibit is excellent, and really highlighting the UN involvement, and the contributions from the international community. There are other parts of the memorial that are more nationalistic, glorifying the Korean military, which you can skip."
98,5.0,very good Museum not only for Korean War history but also touches on other historical events in Korea. Unique artifacts can be found here as well.
99,5.0,"We visited the museum as part of a Korean War Veterans tour. We toured the museum with a HS aged young man who was very knowledgeable and spoke perfect English.   He was an American Civil War history buff too which really surprised me. Anyway we spent several hours inside the museum and many of our group did not realize that there was a large collection of aircraft, tanks, etc. outside the museum building.  So take some time to go outside.  They have a good collection of airplanes including a B-52.  This is a very interesting museum and War Memorial."
100,5.0,"You can spend all day at this museum depending on the pace you go through. It is very informative and best of all FREE! During the summer, if you can try to schedule your visit with the honor guard ceremony, which is interesting to watch. Visited the museum numerous times and is great to walk the grounds during fall and spring."
101,5.0,"A must visit if you are in Korea. A lot of great statues, moments and artifacts all throughout the premises. So much history to be seen and it's available in english as well."
102,5.0,"If you want to find out about how this conflict took place, this is a great place to spend time at. I was familiar with the war but not the detail the memorial displayed. One of the most impressive placesI have been to."
103,5.0,"Terrific outdoor exhibit of missiles, aircraft and boats.  Even a B52.                                               It takes at least an hour to walk through."
104,5.0,One of the best war museums in the world. Really worth a visit each time I visit Seoul. Has changed a lot over the years.
105,4.0,"Didn't spend a lot of time at the memorial,  but did get to look at all the statues. Would love to visit again."
106,4.0,Had a great time here and learned a LOT about the history of warfare on the Korean Peninsula. Inside exhibits well done and the flow through the museum takes you chronologically from floor to floor and room to room. Well marked and easy to follow instructions.
107,4.0,"If you are a war history goers, this place is for you. This place says what you have to know about Korean war in the 50s from South Korean perspective.If you go there during weekdays it's quite empty, but I'm not  so sure during the weekend. The museum has massive carpark too, so not to worry if you go there with a car.In general, this is one of my favourite museum."
108,5.0,"Huge area with three large building covering the wars history of Korea. Large exhibits of aircraft, tanks and ships.Entrance is free."
109,5.0,Great Tour at the memorial. The Tour guide was a lady with depth knowledge on Korean history and who indeed experience the Korean war.
110,5.0,The recollection of bygone korean war's succession of defeats and successes and the sufferings of the Korean people throughout the war and after.
111,5.0,"I thought that I knew the history of the Korean War but this museum gave me so much more and in a very interesting way. It made the history come live, and made me curious for even more info.There is an interesting and very impressive collection of original airplanes and vehicles from the war, and in addition you can see more modern vehicles used by the Korean army.The long rows of stone columns with endless rows of names on South Korean soldiers who died during the Korea War made me quiet and thoughtful. I can't really comprehend the extent of the casualties such a war takes.The history is taking you right up to the newest incidences in the Korean conflict including the naval incidents 1999, 2002 and 2010. This clearly shows why South Korean people and government still take the situation very seriously.The Korean War Museum is a must-see, if you’ll try to understand not just that particular war, but also the whole situation in the East Asian area."
112,4.0,"A well-designed explanation of South Korea's history, with interesting exhibits and plenty of English translations. There are planes, tanks and helicopters outside, too."
113,5.0,"Amazing, and well presented in the floor lay-out and displays.  A very impressive outdoor armament and aircraft display too."
114,5.0,I only spent about two hours there because of other other commitments. Two hours is not enough. Very well done
115,5.0,"As far as museums, go, this one is interesting, varied and easy to navigate.  Most things are in both Korean and English.  Many artistic dioramas and displays make it easier to imagine the war settings and to see the ingenuity involved in the battles and strategies.  I found it very educational and moving.  I had no idea that 1,800,000 Americans had fought in the Korean War!  33,000 were killed.  And 22 nations were involved.  Those are big numbers!"
116,4.0,"If you are a military buff, you HAVE to visit this museum. Armored vehicles, choppers and planes on display outside. Even the entrance to the property with huge statues dedicated to the war will keep you for 10 minutes snapping photos."
117,4.0,It is a must place to visit in seoul. It was great to see thoase real war machines at one place. Also some miniature models are kept in the memorial.
118,5.0,"I literally spent 6 hours here. The exhibits are all subtitled or signed in English. The sculptures out front, and the 'court of flags' (of the nations who had troops in the war) is a great ""thank you"" from the Korean people (or at least, that is how I see it). There is a very somber section where the names are engraved. The only suggestion that I would make if the managers read this is to put a sign in many languages in that area requesting silence, maybe some of the other tourists can take the hint!"
119,4.0,"War memorials tend to be grave and sombre. The outdoor display of guns and other warcraft was however quite stunning and the surrounding park is actually quite pleasant, albeit different from most experiences of this type."
120,5.0,Very interesting half day visit to the War Memorial.  Lots of displays  with many aircraft and other military equipment to see.  Well worth a visit if a history or military buff.
121,5.0,"The South Korean government has done an excellent job of honoring the memory of those who fought so bravely during the Korean Conflict.  Not only Koreans, but those from all the United Nations countries who served, many of whom lost their lives in the cause of freedom!As one enters the grounds, there is a stunning statue atop an open mound known as ""Brothers.""  It depicts two brothers hugging one another:  one is an officer from South Korea, the other, a soldier and younger brother from North Korea.  They meet on the battlefield and embrace.  It is a very powerful statue!  Inside the open mound are pictures and images from both Conflict that express the desire fro reconciliation felt by all the Korean people.  It also depicts the 16 UN nations that fought so courageously in this war.Past this is a huge open field where planes, tanks, trucks, helicopters, rockets and missles are displayed.  Many of these were Korean, but there were also a wide variety of US, Canadian, Russian and Japanese planes, helicopters and tanks.  The largest plane is a B-52 Stratofortress.  There are information plaques to identify each of these and what part they played in the fighting.  The area is surrounded by beautiful flowers and ponds.  There is also a battleship from the war that one can board and see the huge guns and ammunition that was used.  The outside was simply magnificent.  There is also a museum with indoor displays that not only showcase the Korean Conflict, but also many other periods of war in history.  One can easily spend 3-4 hours here enjoying the beauty and the history.  It is a great place for children and families with all the outdoor displays."
122,5.0,This is a massive memorial to a forgotten war. Displays are interesting ans generally well kept. The military equipment outside is a highlight. Recommend at least two hours to see the place.
123,4.0,Really enjoyed this - beautiful monuments lots of history.  I learned a lot and enjoyed the exhibits. Pretty cool seeing all the old planes and tanks.
124,5.0,Absolutely amazing place.  Plan to spend several hours as there is a lot to see.  Admission is free but they will take donations.  If you get hungary there is a small cafe next to the gift shop.
125,5.0,Provided very interesting insight into history of Korean War. Had a lot of interactive options that made tour engaging.  Large display of military equipment.
126,4.0,"The war memorial has a very big outdoor exhibit area full of planes, helicopters, tanks, artillery & boats. Inside there are several floors of small war memorabilia.Overall it was worth spending a half day viewing it all."
127,5.0,I have toured this museum a couple times and still have not seen everything.  English and Korean signs and videos are available at almost every point.  You have the opportunity to actually enter and walk through many airplanes out side and the tours inside the building are very impressive.  worth a whole day but need at least a half day to see it!
128,4.0,Got here early so I didn't get to enter the museum building area. Fantastic display of monuments and military equipment.
129,5.0,This museum is a must see when you come to Seoul. I gained so much knowledge on this visit and to understand the history of Korea and their struggles was humbling.The admission is free but the exhibits are amazing. It is well laid out and there are so many planes and tanks and other military weapons to see. Time well spent.
130,4.0,"Great place - if you plan to go to the DMZ, do stop by here for a more comprehensive explanation of the war before you go. The compound is large. So plan on spending some time here."
131,5.0,"I have visited the War Memorial museum in Seoul on several of my visits.  It is well put together, and loads to see, plus the price is free.  In the warmer months, there are several outside displays of old machinery (tanks, planes, anti-aircraft guns, etc) that are also very nice."
132,5.0,A salut to the Koreans for their pride for their countrymen. I admire them for providing such wonderful site to commemorate their soldiers and heroes. It was actually kind of an emotional experience. Plus there was an area where the Koreans commended the countries who helped them during the Korean war.
133,5.0,"This would rank among one of the most comprehensive war museums in the world. Plenty of preserved tanks, aircraft and even a patrol boat are on exhibition outside the very imposing building. Included is one of only two B52 bombers in a museum outside of the USA (the other one is in Darwin). Inside are some fabulously presented exhibition halls dedicated to remembering those who gave their lives fighting for Korea. The columns of names of the fallen are a very sobering experience. If you are visiting Seoul, set at least a half day (full day would be better) to have a look at the War Memorial of Korea. It's unforgettable."
134,5.0,"Easily located in Samgakchi, this is good for a short visit.  The outdoor exhibits are as good as the inside!"
135,5.0,Don't miss this slice of insight into the Korean War and Korean history. The volunteer took extra time with us and answer our questions as well as explained a Korean view of history.  Great fun!
136,4.0,A really good museum to help understand the Korean War and its impact on a people and many nations.  I appreciated the displays and commemorations from the Korean people
137,5.0,"Lot's of 'hands on' things to see and do.  Patrol boat, tanks, planes all available to explore.  Interesting exhibits and moving displays."
138,5.0,"Been here on business and had a Sunday afternoon free. Expected to go for two hours, but stayed even over 3 hours in the outdoor area, then another 3 hours inside. Absolutely interesting and rich of information about the war and relationship between North and South. As an east-Germany-born traveller I would recommend it to every foreigner - this is important history to understand. Good English descriptions, very well organized. I would definitely say this one first when somebody asks me for the best museum I have been to! Good also for geocachers!"
139,5.0,"Wow, best place to understand Korean and Korean nodern history. There are exhibitions for Korean (1950 ~ 1953). We can understand the tragedy of war and Korean war's weapons by South Korea and North Korea. Further more, the park is beautiful itself. It looks like a peaceful common park. Why don't you enjoy history and leasure time here."
140,5.0,"Wasn't sure if my two youngest kids (12 and 9) were going to enjoy it.  They LOVED it.  so much to see, interactive stuff, movies, etc.  We only had 2.5 hours unfortunately, but I had to drag them out to catch our plane!  Recommend a minimum of 4 hours if you want to only see your main interests and some of the flight simulators..."
141,4.0,"The War Memorial in Seoul is very well laid out and tells the visitors about the various details of Korean Wars.The building is very big and have number of illustrations for telling you the different aspects and stages of different wars. We hired an English guide which was very helpful in understanding of the museum. He explained the importance of weapons on display and also various video clips. The museum outer area has lot of Korean war planes, helicopters etc. The enterance of the museum has lot of stone sculptures which are very well laid out."
142,5.0,The best tourist spot in Seoul. Very well maintained museum. Do keep a good 4-5 hours if you want to see the whole museum and the 3D/4D shows.
143,5.0,"Been here on business and had a Sunday afternoon free. Expected to go for two hours, but stayed even over 3 hours in the outdoor area, then another 3 hours inside.

I would definitely say this one first when somebody asks me for the best museum I have been to! Good also for geocachers!"
144,4.0,"Went to the memorial unsure of how it would be.  Very good exhibits showing history of wars in Korea with nice mix of historical archives/analysis and big war toys like tanks and planes.Was surprisingly interesting and good for a couple hours.  We didn't take one but English tours are available.  One downside, very limited air conditioning adn the place gets hot in summer."
145,4.0,"The memorial includes a huge museum building and large exterior display of ROK, U.S., and Russian military planes, tanks, and related machines, a statue display, and flag display.  This is a huge facility so allow time to see it all.  Check its business hours before visiting to ensure you have enough time to see it all, but the exterior display areas are open even if the museum building is closed.  The museum is only a block or two from a metro stop."
146,5.0,I have been to a lot of museums but no place compares to this museum.  They take a lot of pride is showing their national history of war and remembering the people who helped keep their country free!  This is a must stop while visiting Seoul!
147,5.0,"The Korean War Memorial is well worth the trip to visit.  It's a war memorial, there's not a lot to say apart from that.You can get to it via the city tour bus which is a cheap way round most of the sights to see in Seoul."
148,3.0,"I find it curious that the War Memorial of Korea is the top attraction for Seoul. It is free and it does have interesting bits but top attraction for the average visitor?Anyway the War Memorial is house in a very large building within a large park. One side of the park is full of vintage tanks and aircraft. There is a patrol boat in a pond which is quite impressive in the sense that it's hard to figure out how they got the boat in a pond in the middle of Seoul. The main building has several levels. The main level is dominated by a big room dedicated to those who died in battle. The lower level has a brief military history of Korea from Paleolithic to end of the Korean Empire, told through battles which must be obscure to all but the specialists.The greatest amount of space in the rest of the building is taken up by the details of the Korean War, which must represent more than half the museum. The section on all those countries those that contributed to the UN forces was done very well. The role of the modern Korean military and the Korean defense industry wraps up the exhibition. Overall it is worth a visit and you do see some interesting stuff but on the whole the curation was not very clear and I had trouble trying to see a coherent theme. I think it must be difficult to curate a war museum designed for both locals and visitors, especially if the visitors are from nations who were how shall we say involved in those wars but now are major trading partners."
149,4.0,"Very interesting and informative place to visit albeit somewhat sobering. Lots of information and well-illustrated exhibits about the history of Korea and the Korean war. It is a bit out of the way and whilst it is relatively easy to get to by subway, a taxi is actually a far cheaper option."
150,3.0,it is alway good to remember the ones who fought for their contry -but htis is not mycountry so it is a bit difficult to connect
151,5.0,"Before I arrived in Seoul I planned to visit the War Memorial but never thougt I will spent more than 3 hours visiting. It's a very huge area consisting of outdoor and indoor sections. Outside there are many tanks and armoured vehicles of army, a small ship and some boats of navy and my favourate airplanes such as a huge B-52, F-5, T-33, F-84, F-86 etc. Indoors are seperated in different sections which is designed very good. There is no entry fee. There is a guided English tour at10.00-14.00 hours. Indoor galleries consist of the ones which show the wars Korea went through ( with very good show and animations)  and separate sections for UN countrys which supported them. There is also a section which consists of donations of many war related items. Also an area for children is available. I plan to visit again next time I travel to Seoul ."
152,4.0,"It has a very good timeline of the war and the events surrounding it, as well as many other interesting details. Whilst it was a very informative visit I felt rather sad at the end of my visit due to the nature of the events it was immortalizing. Still worth a visit to learn about some of Korea's history."
153,5.0,Best things you should not miss are 4D theater which  simulates Incheon landing during korean war. 3D theatetr which gives you the feeling of flying Mig 15 fighter jet is also a wonderful experience. the way original documents of Korean war were stored is excellent. I could not find any shortcomings in this war memorial..
154,4.0,Nicely put together museum. An interesting hour to learn about what really happened. Very well designed and shown.
155,5.0,A well designed and fascinating museum.  You cannot understand modern Korea without understanding the turmoil of the Korean War.
156,5.0,"Gorgeous memorial. Very well curated. The War Memorial is a must-see when you're in South Korea.It's seriously the biggest, most awesome war museum I've ever seen. The giant reproduction of a turtle warship from the 1500s is probably their flagship piece, but the extensive grounds full of tanks and planes and other engines of war vie for the top spot of most awesome thing to see there. And that's not even taking into account the inside displays of all the canons and various firearms from I guess every military conflict ever to take place on the peninsula."
157,5.0,"If you are in Seoul, make time for this.  Interactive and interesting.  Will go back if I get chance.  Well worth the time."
158,4.0,"Can reach there using public transit- even if one does not know the language. It is a huge place so be prepared for long long walk. Very well made. Starts with huge door/gates and since it is bang on the main road, it may be a challenge to cross the road. Worth the visit. Very well maintained."
159,5.0,Had a very brief stop at the Memorial. The multiple name listings gives a better understanding of the losses suffered.  A very nicely maintained tribute.
160,5.0,"There was no entrance fee which is amazing...!!! Very good to reach by Subway. And very very good and interesting museum... Loved the set-up of it... A must see when in Seoul, I think..?!?"
161,4.0,If you like military gadgets this place is great. Also a lot of information regarding the Korean war.
162,5.0,"I've been to South Korea as part of a business trip. I had 2 days to explore Seoul, and after taking a look at the palaces and other central locations, I found this gem. If you like history like I do, you will greatly enjoy this museum. All places have ""English buttons""  that tell about what you see, though you might feel a bit awkward, as generally you will be the only foreign person, and the Koreans will patiently wait till you hear it out. I liked the ancient boat especially. Don't use the cafeteria, it is a total disaster - better to bring your own food."
163,4.0,Many Turkish soldiers fight and died in Korea during Korean War. For that reason I wanted to visit War Memorial. It was huge and impressing.  There were many children there with their teachers to learn the history of South Korea.
164,5.0,"It is accessible, interesting and really telling on events that are not very far away and we need to continue thinking about."
165,4.0,"Its difficult to make such a subject as war a tourist attract but the museum has done this very well the building is attractive, with external displays that are very good and very spacious interesting displays in side. Certainly worth a visit if its a rainy day. Its even possible to get married there Korean style."
166,4.0,Well worth the time to visit. Inspiring and thought provoking and well put together. I recommend it.
167,5.0,the military history of Korea goes back many centuries and this museum captures it all up to the modern era.
168,5.0,"this was about 30 min cab ride from downtown Seoul (gangham area) and it was worth the ride. first, it was free admission running on donations. The amount of items here is just mind boggling. It was really great to see planes such as B52, tanks and helicopters that were used in the war. I spent a good 4 hours here, and left satisfied. You could easily spend all day here.  If you had family that passed in the war, there is nice memorial in the front of all members KIA from all countries.The amount of information given, really put the war in perspective."
169,5.0,"As a citizen of a Korean War participant country, it was definitely more than i expected. We ended up crying in the United Nations hall. It is an amazing memorial, which shows respect and apretiation for the participant country. Definitely should be seen!"
170,4.0,For a swede with little knowledge of the Korean War it was a really educating and strong experience. The museum exhibit a huge amount of weapons from both the North Korea and from the South Korea. It take a while to see everything but it is well spend time. No entrance fee wish is nice too.
171,5.0,"Provides great review of Korea and the wars they fought since the bronze era. Lots of displays, in many different languages. Can spend many hours at the displays both in the museum and on the grounds."
172,3.0,"I unfortunately could only get to the memorial on a Monday, when the museum is closed. I did see the exterior exhibits, I found the display unordered, with only very basic English explanations. The Korean could have been more detailed. The exhibition includes quite a few aircraft, tanks, some missiles and AA guns, and some other heavy military equipment. unfortunately the exhibits look deteriorated and dirty. I did enjoy some of the impressive statues. In short if you have the time and enjoy this kind of attraction you should put the memorial somewhere on your list of sites to see in Seoul."
173,5.0,This is the first war memorial I have ever seen and this was an excellent experience. This museum offered a good balance of war time information along with interesting tidbits and artifacts from the war time. I could only spend about 2 hours in the museum and I will have to revisit there again to see this completely. Nice audio visual effects of the war time videos. I can easily spend an entire day over there.
174,5.0,The Korean War has been the most important event for the two Koreas in the 20th Century. The War Memorial is an outstanding museum to display these terrible and tragic events. It is particularly also easy accessible for the younger generation as there is a lot of audiovisual stuff and 4D-movies.
175,5.0,You can spend a whole day here. There are many great things to see. There is also an outdoor exhibit which has lots of military tanks and planes. The dislike was that there was no air-conditioning inside of the building.
176,4.0,"Remembering how difficult the past has been, the lives of those that sacrificied to give us peace... worth a trip"
177,5.0,"The museum was divided into sections - 3 for the Korean War and 1 for earlier military history.  At the time of my visit, the 3rd section of the Korean War exhibit was under renovation.  THe static display outside the museum was nice."
178,5.0,I learned more in four hours here than in any class I have ever taken.  The museum was extremely well layed out and maintained and the displays were creative and informative.
179,5.0,"What a great place to visit! This memorial is a combination of a memorial and a history museum. Outside the building there are a variety of powerful statues and tributes to those who took part in the Korean War. There is also a range of military planes and ships on display [great for kids to look at!]. The museum itself is extremely informative and very tastefully done. We ended up arriving right in time for a free tour in English, and our guide (Roy) was knowledgeable and friendly. I walked out feeling like I had learned far more about the Korean War than I would have gleaned from any history book."
180,4.0,the war that never ends....people on edge ...thats what is displayed here....the tears of people ...and the spirit that never dies...two cousin ...apart...
181,5.0,"The real-life crisis of a country divided in two by outside parties, waging war back and forth across their tiny country over five years with the only outcome being a highly divided country - a tragedy at all levels but a testament to human revolve."
182,5.0,"Fantastic (admittedly biased) museum of military history. Planes and tanks aplenty, and interesting displays inside with plenty of signage in English. And even an electronic rifle range to practice your sharpshooting. Moving memorials to the Korean War dead too. At certain points in the year they also do military precision drill displays on a Friday afternoon so I'll be back for that for sure..."
183,4.0,If yue are interested in military technologynand late 20 century military eventsbamust see. Quite interestingbartifactsband memorablia. Museum shop needs a bit more interesting gift ideas. Korean war ration for example?
184,4.0,"Seoulmate provide FREE SEOUL TOUR. They have 11 tour courses, and this War Memorial of Korea is one of the tour courses. If you will go with seoul mate, you can feel real seoul."
185,4.0,Great venue for this event and continued to see plenty of tourists visit the museum whilst i was there for 7 days!
186,5.0,"deep depiction of the korean war through the korean's eyes. a must if you're a military buff. also a large ""park"" full of tanks, choppers, planes...etc"
187,3.0,"I like visiting the Memorial, but the museum felt kind of empty.  There is a lot of stuff to see, in a very big space."
188,4.0,"My favorite display was the full size ""Turtle Ship"".  We have a model of this ship in Newport News Virginia at the Mariner's Museum, so I found it fascinating. I found the Korean War displays to be extremely well prepared and laid out."
189,5.0,"I spent a couple of hours here watching the movies (good but maybe would have liked English subtitles).  There are a lot of things to see, including finding out all of the places South Korea has sent their military out across the world.  The Korean War exhibit was very good."
190,5.0,A testiment to the local and international efforts and sacrifices of persons and families only 50 odd or so years ago. An artistic and emotional tribute to the best and worst we are.
191,4.0,"This museum is very interesting in its coverage of all wars involving Korea going back to the dynasties of the seventh century or so. My particular interest, however, were the WWII and Korean War eras. These were indeed covered very thoroughly in a very engaging manner. The displays were very informative and I learned quite a lot. It is interesting to get the Korean perspective on these events. I recommend this museum if you have any interest at all in this subject matter."
192,5.0,This place is definitely worth visiting if you're in Seoul. It offers insight into the sad history of Korean war
193,4.0,"Visiting this museum, keep in mind what the money spent on war could do for humanity if we didn't wage war"
194,5.0,"Kinda creepy that they have a ""how to don a gas mask"" area for kids, but probably necessary.  Great exhibits."
195,3.0,"The Korean War Memorial museum was an expansive and well-done grounds with 4-D experience of Incheon landing.I think this war needs to be remembered and would have appreciated a little more about real people's experience. It is heavily military, but as a military history experience is it good.I was there on a day with many elderly Koreans - and some of the men were looking at the large equipment, going over every detail, laughing while shaking their heads in reminiscence of what they had survived. And many did not survive this horrible period of Korean history. I wanted more of their story - not just weaponry."
196,4.0,Outside displays very cool but was surprised to find it closed on a Monday.
197,5.0,"Every kind of military hardware used in the Korean War or by Korean forces in subsequent conflicts is on display here. Row upon row of tanks, planes, helicopters, etc. There is even a B-52! The museum also contains historic materials on the Korean War, walls of names of those who fell defending South Korea, etc. It's a moving and slightly strange place. The South Korean patrol boat that was shot up by the North in 2010 or 2011 is there (the Norther attackers were sunk). All the shell holes from the North's attack are outlined in red paint. There are also some very interesting statues on the grounds. When I was there in 2010, by chance on the anniversary of the end of the Korean War, we witnessed a bizarre interpretive dance. Good cheap food in the cafeteria. Lots of little kids on school field trips drawing bloody battle scenes for class credit. Go see it for yourself."
198,5.0,"Lots of aircraft, tanks, missile launchers etc on display"
199,5.0,"Very touching, excellent museum to visit.  I put this right up there with the ones in Washington, DC.  So many lost there lives which I am so grateful for, the museum had no charge to the public, it was free."
