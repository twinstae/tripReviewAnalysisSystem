0,4.0,"Beautiful little stream with people walking and jogging around. However if you go there during the night, it can be a bit scary as the street light is not much in terms of quantity and brightness. But don't worry as local people here are very nice and friendly. It is also peaceful to walk during the night."
1,5.0,It is quite nice man made attraction at the middle of the city. People just walk along the stream enjoying scenery.
2,5.0,"You won’t miss this if you’re walking from kwangjang market. Pop by for a quick photo, beautiful reflection of the sky in the stream."

4,4.0,"Magificant light festival along the river, whenever you go to Seoul it’s akways worth checking what’s happening on the river. Lots of bars and restraints nearby"
5,5.0,"Located in the Centre of the metropolis, the walkway gives a sense of calmness from the fast paced city. No festivities while I was here but I’m sure events would be well decorated."
6,5.0,"A must see place in Korea, it is located in the middle of tall buildings but it’s amazing how they preserve the place. It is indeed so rich in culture. A huge place to visit. You need at least half a day to visit all the sites in the palace. When you wear the hanbok costume, the entrance is free."
7,3.0,"The famous stream was next to our hotel and of course having seen it in so many korean drama, we had to take a look. It was just a stream and on a hot summer day, many tourists were seen soaking their feet in the water. Nothing much to do here."
8,5.0,"My Korean friends have told me that Cheonggyechon Strean is exclusively for couples, but is not the case, of course, you will see couples walking around and having a romantic moment but you can go check out the stream with friends and family too. The best thing is you can take off your shoes and dip your feet in the stream. Since is summer, many people go there and they bring their snacks and beer to have a relaxing moment. Here is where the lantern festival takes place in November, if you are in Korea around that time I highly recommend you to check it out. You won't get disappointed."
9,3.0,I didn't know what was the big deal when everyone told me I have to visit the steam. It's a very long walk until the end of the stream - you don't have to walk all the way. The view is better in the evening. Apparently it used to be road. And the government decide to make it a stream. I think that's a fantastic idea! I appreciate the stream even more
10,5.0,"I went there around 6.30 pm so that I had an hour walking along, and then saw the sky changed its colour"
11,4.0,It is indeed a place worth visiting.  We strolled along the stream and stopped to sit at the side to enjoy the breezy wind and get some sunlight during the spring season.  Don't forget to bring some titbits and a bottle of hot tea with you at your next visit.
12,5.0,"We were here first at night, and everything was decorated with lanterns because of Buddha's birthday, so it looked really awesome. But also during the day, it's a nice place to take a walk."
13,4.0,It was a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the surrounding markets. There was a water fountain.
14,4.0,We stayed a bus ride away from the stream so we appreciated the nature amongst the bustling city when we arrived. The Stream is set lower than the streets surrounding it which separates the area a little better and as we walked down on a Saturday morning we were able to take a nice break before we headed out to busier parts of Seoul. It was a peaceful area and was nice to relax in.
15,5.0,We decided to walk from Gwangjang Market to Dongdaemun Market (about 20 minutes) and it was such a peaceful walk. It felt like we stepped out of the city into another place.
16,4.0,"For art lovers , then you could stay here. We had our own photo taking . Nice place to stroll around. Watch out for announcement of festivals , it would a much better environment."
17,4.0,"I’d suggest going early in the morning, and walking along this stream. No traffic lights here! Also in the evening, along some sections, there a small laser show. Actually quiet peaceful by this stream.Only negative, needs more signage, so you know where to exit from, or which street your at."

19,3.0,"Although the stream was unimpressive and small, its river bank has been spruced up and decorated with caricatures, paintings, plastic models and structures, which help livened up and made the riverside ""interesting and attractive"". Clean and uncluttered, the tagline then was ""I Seoul U""....."
20,5.0,"This is a great oasis in a very busy city, and is perfect for a contemplative walk, a jog, or just to sit and soak up the atmosphere."
21,1.0,"South Koreans don't like to pick up their litter. In an advanced country like this, everyone just throws their garbage everywhere. It's sad."
22,4.0,"This place is transformed to be a very beautiful area during christmas season.. all the lighting and christmas tree make it amazing at night. If u go to seoul on December, its a must see.."
23,3.0,Displays of lanterns along the stream.  Nice place to chill out and enjoy the lovely lights after a day of shopping!
24,3.0,Unless  u are a couple which is food as it's dark.  If not go in the morning between 9 to 12 PM as you will be able to see the change of guards. As  night time  unless there are some events if not . There are not much lights to see much of the  beautiful history or this stream which survived wars
25,4.0,Lovely way to get away from the streets and still get where you need to go. The sound of the water and traditional music was a nice change from the cars when walking the busy streets. There was still a lot of greenery in October.
26,4.0,"Yes, try to stroll a stretch along this stream. Really gives you a break from the city traffic and noises..."
27,4.0,"nice place to walk in the evening, when the lantarns are in the water arround the festival periods it is just perfect"
28,4.0,"During the day, the stream is just there amongst the hustle as it is close to the markets.At night, it comes alive with lights that give it a unique feel. There is a water fall with lights at one end and then you follow it down where there is displays of light here and there.There are stone steps across the steam if you want to cross over.  I enjoyed walking below the street level with the stream next to me while you are surrounded by office towers."
29,5.0,"Wow. What a great place to go for a stroll in this noisy, big city. I lived in Korea many years ago and it’s hard to believe this river was under my feet. It’s a lovely place to walk and take a break."
30,5.0,This is such a lovely place to visit in the hub of a busy city. We strolled along the stream in the evening and it was just lovely and peaceful.
31,5.0,I usually go to S.Korea in the winter time so there are always light installations at the stream.  It's very nicely designed and perfect for photo ops! If you're in S.Korea I totally recommend this as a place to check out.
32,5.0,"Buy some street food and bring it here with a loved one or someone you're trying to woo. It will make them fall for you just like in K-dramas. Even better, if it's raining, make them share an umbrella with you."
33,5.0,"I am shocked by the fact this stream is so clear that you can see fishes. The water is so cold. Try putting your legs there. It's refreshing! And, don't forget to cross the river. After a long day, spending my time at this stream heals me a lot."
34,5.0,"This is a lovely place to take a quiet stroll, and makes for a nice alternative to the sidewalks above. It's well lit at night as well."
35,4.0,"Lovely little stream, the history behind it as well is also fascinating. Nice and cool with lots of shade on hot days, and not too busy either."
36,4.0,"Offers light show, a good walk or place to dip your feet during summer. This park caters to all. A good walking distance from Myeongdong Shopping Street."
37,4.0,"This is about the most peaceful place in Seoul that I could possibly think of. Spring and fall are great times to visit, and the stream also plays host to the Lantern Festival in November. Usually a lot of space to relax, unwind, and contemplate."
38,4.0,I love this place but too bad I always went there in the afternoon. Hope i could visit there at night later
39,5.0,"Having a walk beside the stream in a hot summer afternoon, you feel cool, quite and relax.   It is really a marvelous water work, turning a dirty sewage into a clear stream."
40,5.0,"Its refreshing, in the middle of the road you cant believe that you can find a clean water and solemn park."
41,5.0,"This place comes alive at night. Night bazaars lighting up the place, and busking groups spread across the area.The area used to be a place of waste, but then it was rebuilt as public place with a stream flowing in the middle. Stairs are provided for people to sit down and spend times with loved ones. You can even dip your feet in the stream as it is very shallow.You can find friends, lovers, and sometimes family just sit beside the stream, chatting, eat, and drink beers.The place is near Gwanghwamun area, so you can also enjoy buildings and night lights."
42,5.0,I'm a nature lover that's why i love this stream. Its sound and the cold water is sooo refreshing. A must go place after a tiring all day seoul touring. :)
43,5.0,"Very cool manmade underground stream.  Often there are concerts , markets or other events held at the beginning of the stream"
44,5.0,Beautiful man made stream and love the rainbow lights. Landscaping along the stream are beautifully done. Must see
45,5.0,"Its so refreshing and calming, listening to the flowing water.Nice place to take a rest when you get tired walking."
46,5.0,"Have a stroll down the stream with your loved ones, family, alone or a best friend. Super relaxing and the whole vibe is sure to get you in the mood to want to lay your mat and picnic somewhere cosy. If you’re lucky you might spot cute ducks waddling in the stream. Recommended, highly. If you love quiet places to spend quality time with your loved ones or alone."
47,4.0,"Little fountains. waterfalls, lots of places to sit but it's all concrete. If you are walking by the area, you would enjoy it for 10 minutes"
48,5.0,"Had to visit this stream in our tour, but before that you will pass Kyobo, which I think the biggest bookstore I've seen in my entire existence yet. And after there you'd see this stream which is a very nice place, but yeah nothing much to do here."
49,5.0,A small canal about 10 km in the center of Seoul. The canal has been rotten in the past. Now it is the public park and it has waterfalls in the big city center between many tall buildings. It make us relax.
50,5.0,"After many activities of shopping and eating in Seoul, this river offers freshness and tranquility. You can just take a walk or run (if you want) along the river. It is FREE and refreshing! There is also a coin spot for you to make a wish in this river. Such a lovely place 💙"
51,5.0,"A nice way to move through the city, quiet and pretty. There are a few places you can scan with your phone and get translated information on the plaques/exhibits."
52,4.0,Its better to go there at night. The river is beautiful with some of light decoration. Many people visited here especially couples. Many foodstans too.
53,5.0,"Was fortunate to visit during the lantern festival that promoted the 2018 winter Olympic games.  Fantastic experience, especially since I had assistance from really friendly locals to help put my lantern together to send it downstream"
54,3.0,"Read some reviews about this place and this is my comment: Timing.We were there at night during the Christmas week and there were some human traffic about, but not overly heavy that we were not able to take pictures of the stream and the Christmas deco placed. However, the particular night we were there, it was pretty cold and it was 10ish so we did not complete the entire walk, just after some Santa Claus blow up dolls. For those intending to visit this place, some things to consider:-a) time of the dayb) season - maybe there are more things to see during certain seasonc) potential festivals - eg Christmas, Lantern Festival, New Years, etc"
55,3.0,passed by the stream many times but i only went down to take a walk this time round. many parts were still covered in snow.. (there was heavy snow abt 1-2 days before i reached). nice place for a stroll and taking photos but it can be cold and somewhat slippery depending on the weather.
56,3.0,In a busy city of Seoul there is a walking stream path. While it isn't anything special the stream path was good to get away. There are lanterns that lights up at night time
57,5.0,"This is definitely a site to see! No entrance fee, walkable from Myeongdong, 15 mins. It's amazing how the old unused canal has been converted into a nice green eco-rich area.  You can stay here as long as you want, sit, read, eat. Beautiful place!"
58,5.0,Peacful place in the middle of the city. On warmer days I would definitely spend my time here eating food from Gwangjang market.
59,4.0,สะอวด สวย เดินเล่นได้ แม้ว่าอากาศเย็นก็มีคนมาเดิน ออกกำลังกาย.  ไม่อยากคิดเลยว่าจะมีบรรยากาศธรรมชาติที่สวยงาม สะอาด ท่ามกลางแห่งshopมากมายNice and clean canal. Let’s stop by for walk after shopping or conference.
60,1.0,"We found the stream easily enough but after following it for the awhile, we still hadn’t encountered the “main attraction”.  As a featured sight, it will help tourists if the exact point of the stream worth viewing is indicated."
61,3.0,"We visited the annual November lantern festival along the stream. While it is a nice walk with the autumn breeze in the evening viewing the different lanterns, the long distance we travelled to visit it didn‘t seem worthwhile"
62,4.0,"This stream running centrally in Seoul, is innocuous by day, but in the evening is lit up with a plethora of lanterns and lights, and is most attractive."
63,4.0,we went at night which also happened to coincide with the lantern festival. beautifully lit lanterns along the stream. jam-packed with people and there were people to direct the public to only move in a single direction. nice place...very lively atmostphere
64,4.0,We happened to be in Seoul during the autumn lantern festival. The stream is festively decorated with a variety of lighted displays. It made the stream so festive with the full moon backdrop. So worth battling the crowds.
65,3.0,"As our airbnb was along this stream at Jonggak station, it's almost a daily event for us to walk passed. I would definitely recommend walking along this stream to get to Myeongdong instead of taking the subway. It took us about 10 to 15 mins with a few traffic lights to Myeongdong shopping area. Like most tourists, our initial days were spent taking subways, climbing up and down the stairs just to change train at Seoul station. The stream needs maintenance. Too much wild plants growing on both sides. Lights at both sides were dim and not many street lights available on street level. Can be dangerous for a lady walking alone at night. There were many exits along the whole stretch so do note which exit you are going."
66,5.0,"A calm from the storm, if you want to walk and get off the normal city streets, this is the place you would like to go.  Great for a run or bike ride.  It really is a beautiful amenity that can easily be missed in the busyness that surrounds you."
67,5.0,"Today was an unusual quiet Sunday as most people have left the city for the October Golden Week holiday. The walk was very enjoyable without shoulder bumping shoulder or endless young children running. The serenity of the stream after Euljiro-3-ga is almost like a fairytale oasis. A lot more greens and wild flowers on both sides of the stream. There are also fish, birds and even stork."
68,5.0,"I love hanging out in this area, it's giving me kind of peaceful feeling. It's surround by office building, and rows of tree. I believe it would be wonderful in the autumn. The water so clean, you can dip your feet into the stream."
69,4.0,"This stream is a rejuvination of Seoul. Years back, an elevated highway buried the stream. It is easy to see how you can while away an hour or two of your time at this place. Watch out though where you are stepping, especially when getting a good shot of the waterfalls where the stream begins. My foot fell into a gap and got my shoe wet. Safety first! 😛"
70,4.0,"Very cool usage of urban space. Not much to do there but walk around or stick your feet in the river. But if you have some time between sightseeing, I would recommend getting a bottle of soju, some food, and having a quick picnic by the stream."
71,5.0,"I like walking around along Cheonggyecheon Stream during the summer nights. I have some friends who work near there so we meet up somewhere in one of nearby restaurants and we take a walk afterwards and catch up with one another. Sometimes, there are some artists who sing there and some exhibitions that worth having a look. Often, couples walk arm in arm and everything seems very romantic."
72,4.0,"Lovely long peaceful walk, clean water with heaps of different fish, stepping stones, flowers. Great place for a jog, or a break from the city bustle."
73,4.0,The stream is good for visit both daytime and at night. It was a leisure stroll along the stream at daytime especially during weekends as parents like to bring their kids there for fun. There are many coffee shops along both side of the stream for rest after the walk. Evening visit is more interesting as  the lantern lights floating on the stream are on. A good photo spot for evening scene.
74,5.0,This is also one of the spots in Seoul where you can get away from the chaos of the city. After a long day spent on a city tour this is one of the best places to go to chill before you go back to your place. Check the schedule of the lantern festival in November. We were able to catch it and it was really awesome!It can get a little crowded but still a good space to walk around with friends. You can also space out while staring at the stream if you are really tired. You can also chance upon a hot air balloon and a busker.I recommend doing this at night especially during the lantern festival!
75,5.0,"Perhaps one of the more surprising parts of downtown Seoul, this is a haven from the skyscrapers and traffic. Very popular with locals at lunchtimes and going home, it deserves a visit from anyone seeing Seoul."
76,4.0,I enjoy walking along the stream. Even better if you go with your love. at the end of the stream is a nice scene to watch and enjoy.
77,3.0,"If you are near Dongdaemun, just go for a nice walk. Evenings are good and lightings would be there mostly.  Very peaceful area even though it's in middle of the city.But there is nothing else amusing and don't make it as a destination for your Seoul trip."
78,5.0,It was a good long walk from one end of the stream to the other end and it was cooling enough to walk the entire way on a September night in Seoul without breaking a sweat!Many people come here for dates and it's a good place to bring your partner for a romantic night out. Many food places around so you won't be left hungry.
79,5.0,"Probably one of the most endearing parts of Seoul, this former sewer was recovered and turned into a well thought out walking park.  We loved the crowds playing in the water on Sunday and the enormous mural of the funeral procession (actual numbers!).  The next day, I travelled away from the giant corkscrew on the smaller, more rural side of the creek, which was just as fun.  Made it all the way down to the Eastern gate - a lovely walk."
80,5.0,"In Seoul, everything is fast and modernBut this stream brings back calm and less pollution to your bodyYou can run, bike, enjoy a walk, have a dateEverything is so peaceful next to that cute stream, especially on Lantern FestivalI recommend it :)"
81,4.0,"Nice to find a place like this in the middle of an urban jungle! I think that hether or not you will appreciate it depends on the time that you visit. Visit early in the morning if you appreciate the calm and quiet -- there will barely be any people at this time (at most, maybe a handful jogging or exercising in the area). If you would like to see the place full of life, go in the late afternoon to evening (there are also usually bazaars by the stream at this time on weekends)."
82,5.0,good for a nearby morning stroll and perhaps a nice soak of feet during summer LOL. would be good to check out for exhibition as the plain stream can look plain. LOL
83,5.0,"I absolutely love visiting the Cheonggyecheon Stream! This is a place I could've visited every day during my week in Seoul and still enjoyed it. My first experience visiting the stream was on my second night in the city and this was during the Seoul Performing Arts Festival. We were dead tired when we arrived here, having spent most of the day at the Gyeongbokgung palace premise in the intense sun, but this place uplifted our spirits almost instantly! I never thought that I'd love a crowded place as much as I did, but this place just blew my mind away!"
84,5.0,This is just a walking district with the stream beautiful street made around a simple stream that crosses the city. On both sides there is a sort of embarkment for walking people. In its begging few portals go down from the embankment upper area to walk by the stream. In the night it is nicely lighted with great ambiance around.
85,3.0,This stream cuts through the city but otherwise is pretty unimpressive if you come from a place with lots of natural water.
86,4.0,The Cheonggyecheon Stream used to be covered by roading but was dug up some years ago to reveal the stream. Nice place to have a wander particularly during a hot day. Many people sit with their legs in the water relaxing and cooling down. During the Lantern Festival the stream has many lanterns and displays and looks absolutely stunning. A nice little oasis in the middle of the city.
87,5.0,"After a day's tiring tour of the city, we went here and dipped our tired feet in its cold water even if it was summer already. What a relief!! It was enough to recharge and to scour again its surroundings. I suggest you navigate the entire stretch especially at dusk and you will see how this place is teeming with activities. There's even an exhibit under the bridge and there was this cool sax player who played several songs to the delight of those sitting around with their dates."
88,5.0,"Took a walk along the Cheonggyecheon stream after dinner and it was so lovely. It felt a little surreal to see the towering skyscrapers line the banks of the stream. There were different activities along the banks, such as light shows, musical performances and art exhibitions. It also seems like a popular place for dates as we saw many couples seated along the banks! A perfect place to stroll, relax and chill at night!"
89,5.0,We liked this place so much that we actually went here twice. It is very calming and looks the best at night
90,3.0,"Interesting to note about that the river was cleaned and rebuilt as an attraction for Seoulites to enjoy strolling. However, there is really nothing impressive to see while strolling on the river banks. Just take photos from the top and it's enough."
91,5.0,"A beautiful stream which is great for walking alongside. The waterfall is best place to start and an awesome location for taking photo's.Art alongside the walls, historic references and stepping stones to cross the stream. Above you can here the traffic of Seoul going about there business and in the evenings the surrounding buildings light up with colour. Some of the bridges have beautiful art underneath them.Take some bug spray if you are planning an evening stroll after a hot day.You have to visit the stream if you are in Seoul."
92,5.0,"Love this place, been here in 2014 and again in 2017. Made good memories each time. Really good to just stroll with a friend or sit around and eat food or drink beer."
93,4.0,It was nice to visit this place at night. It's actually SEOUL Lantern Festival when we got here. One of the most famous sightseeing spots in Seoul.
94,4.0,"Walking along the river is a much nicer way to walk to where you want to be right in the middle of the city.  Walking back however we wanted to stay out of the sun.  The path on that side was narrow with walkers out during their lunch breaks, in groups, and not easy to walk around/past."
95,5.0,It is a nice leisure place to spend an afternoon. Many local residents taking off their shoes immersing their feet into the stream. There are performers busking along the stream adding colors to the place
96,5.0,Please visit for having a break during a day. You will never be disappointed. Family friendly place.. You can sit down and put feet in.
97,4.0,"For me this place is special, we stayed here few hours, very scenic, clean, and just a few blocks away from our hostel. Very clean, you can stay here as long as you want, a public place but maintained well."
98,4.0,You should not miss a walk along the stream at daytime and after dark. Look at the local people enjoying this atraction at the city center and admire the initiative
99,4.0,The stream is located at the Dongdaemun area and many kids play around at the stream. It is a nice place to sit down and take a break after a long day of shopping at Dongdaemun!
100,5.0,This is a perfect place to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city even though it is positioned right in the city! Very relaxing and some amazing artwork on some parts of the walls as well. Keep an eye out in the stream for wildlife! I spotted some very large fish and also turtle!
101,5.0,"Great spot if you want to walk in a calmer setting in the center of Seoul, some parts aregreen with trees and really beautiful."
102,4.0,"I just visited this past week as I wanted to see the famous paper lanterns on the stream in preparation for May 3rd's Buddha's Birthday. The walk by the stream is quite long which is nice; however, wgen I went it was really crowded by the main lantern areas so it was difficult to walk around. However, the mkre distant paets were not so crowded. The only issue I have is that the staircase to go up and down might be difficult for the elderly or those with knee problems such as myself. I was able to avoid the stairs on the way down taking a ramp close to the entrance but had to take stairs on the way out - or I would have to go all the way back to the entrance. I would like to give it 3.8/5."
103,5.0,A nice river with fresh air and clear waterA nice pathway to walk from Dongmyo station to walk to Dongdaemunyou can save money and exercise at the same timeYou can breath in fresh air to purify your body and become restful.Suitable for those embrace the nature.
104,4.0,"We came to this place by subway, green line and stop in sindang station. After that, walk about 250 meter.The stream located between highrise building in the middle of the city.The place is calm, local people used to come here just for relax, meet up with friends or family, have a little sport.There's a small waterfall in the end of the stream. The water that run through the stream is clean and clear.It's so refreshing, sound of the birds and the water accompany us enjoying this place. Some trees stretch in the edge of the stream, made beautiful scenery."
105,5.0,its a very nice place to go and relax. Sit by the stream and enjoy the calmness. good place for photography and people watching. the stream is 8km long. A great place for family and kids.
106,4.0,The area became very lively during that festival. Colourful lanterns were being displayed along the stream . We had an enjoyable walk that evening.
107,3.0,Well it's a small stream running through Dongdaemun. Not very clean so I quickly abandoned the idea of a stroll along its bank.
108,4.0,A good walk to walk.. quiet  walk with good ambiance. . Recommended for a quiet walk..Overall simple canal.. nothing special. . But its very close to Myongdong so on the way u can have a look at it
109,4.0,"There are few reasons for my review title: a) Regrettably I wasn't w/ a boyfriend [not on a date]; b) my feet hurt from walking all day; c) it was freezing cold temperature. Otherwise, it would have earned  a pretty perfect score. I truly wished I was with a nice guy; enjoying a Spring or Summer night walk along the stream. That would be pleasantly romantic indeed."
110,3.0,"Was there in the morning. While it had a nice view and serene to walk through, I think it'll be better done at night to see the lights. There is nothing to see otherwise unless you do one of the Seoul walking tours which will provide you with some information along the way."
111,5.0,It was winter when I went there but I have enjoyed snow fall there and it was so exciting. Glad to be there!
112,5.0,Chenggyecheon is right by Gwanghamun (the area with King Sejong and the statue) - and so it's definitely worth checking out. I've gone during the day and during the night and both are GREAT times to walk the area. At night they light up the waterfall at the end of the stream and it's absolutely beautiful - such a nice treat in the urban setting of Seoul!
113,4.0,Located in middle of seoul near gwanghawmun square. Very clean stream and have historical story about this.
114,4.0,"Cheongey-cheon is pretty much historical stream located along the middle of downtown Jongroe. The more you know, you can see more. To see the historical changes of this stream, I recommend to plan to visit this place including Cheongye-cheon museum together.If you plan to drop by Ming dong (Myung dong ?) for shoping or restaurant, it will be good to have a chance to walk along the stream...If your hotel is in the downtowm Seoul near this stream and want to take a walk in the morning or evening, absolutely this is good place to have.  Also I recommend to seniors as well."
115,5.0,"Cheonggyecheon stream is not famous for how it look, but it is famous how they made this canal happened. This is a symbol of success in escalating the normal canal into stream park where people hanging out."
116,4.0,"It's amazing how this stream makes me feel peaceful inside a busy city as Seoul. I would just sit there for hours and read my book. The wall decoration is nice culture art.If you wanna get some quiet time, go there."
117,4.0,It's very relaxing and romantic spot... I just loved it... walking around with a coupe of coffee following the stream of the river can make your day
118,5.0,"This is a very beautiful place to visit. If you've seen it on TV, it's just like it. A must-go place."
119,5.0,"Great to go for a walk in the evening. Go there walk a little, find a nice spot to sit and have a good time talking with your friends or your love. Very relaxing area... Super beautiful."
120,4.0,"this place is surely nice , but if you went at night you will see a lot of couples there . what i did with my friend we went to the grocery store to get some snacks and some drinks and we picnic there . its a good place for it"
121,2.0,"This stream on an average day is just a stream. Since it doesn't stink, I guess one would enjoy a leisurely stroll along the paved banks."
122,5.0,"I completely forgot about this area and I stumbled across it as I was heading to an office nearby. This month they have their winter decorations up. My little one and I took many pictures there. I had expected it to be more crowded, but there weren't many people at all. I went there 4 years ago and it was still as beautiful as I remembered. A great tourist spot so be ready with your camera. I wouldn't suggest letting your children run loose because there are no guards to protect from going in the stream. They have a walkway that they built that I don't remember being there before. Usually you can walk on the rocks to cross the stream. The Christmas decorations are so lovely, please go and enjoy."
123,4.0,Lovely place to stroll and chill on a cool day. Take the time to unwind and soak into the beautiful scenery surrounding this stream.
124,5.0,Nice place to see lights at night. Photo taking should be done in the afternoon to have a nicer view of the surroundings. It is a nice place for a stroll in winter where there will be no insects! I went to this stream a few months ago also and that was during the end autumn and it was a horrible experience as there was endless amount of flies. I had to walked out of the stream just to avoid all the flies.
125,4.0,"A stream that is right in the middle of Seoul, a great place to stop by in the evening after work, dip your feet in the cool stream and watch the sun set over the giant buildings."
126,3.0,"I see ao many review about this beautiful place. Full of light it says. But when i visited it, unfortunately  just ordinary light.  So,  please make sure about the time to see the beautiful light"
127,4.0,"An extremely long stream running through the city, this is the perfect place to unwind after a long day of sightseeing. Order some takeout, sit by this stream and relax!"
128,5.0,"it's was during korean lantern festival, held for 3 weeks, ended on 20th Nov 2016. huge lanterns in many designs were floating on the water. the stream is always my favourite spot for visiting; beautiful, clean and well maintained.awesome view during daytime and even spectacular during nighttime.do go for a walk if you are around the area, you won't be regret."
129,4.0,"Originally a drainage ditch, it was once covered over but has been opened in recent times and is like an urban canal with walkways on either side and stepping stones across.There are numerous quirky sculptures and other artistic features.Well worth a short walk."
130,5.0,"As a local here, I always enjoy a little stroll at night after having dinner with friends. I would not suggest to visit here as the main purpose, but even if you do, a lot of touristic sights are along the stream. My favorite course would be to start from the main starting point which is by Gwanghwamun and walk your way east strolling until Jongro5ga, where there is a local market called ""Gwangjang sijang(market)"" where you can stop for many delicious street food!"
131,4.0,Not sure that there is much to see here other than when a festival is on. We were there for the Lantern Festival and it was very colourful with lots of different lantern themes.Very organised in that you are directed to walk in a certain direction only.
132,5.0,I went here around evening on weekdays.. not much tourist or activities on february (maybe its winter there). We freely taking some pictures along stream.. also have a wish well there.. throw some coins and make your wish.. ~ gudluck..
133,5.0,little interlude in seoul  very typical of korea.Trees and water keep the temperature down to enjoy some time out and nature
134,4.0,This stream is well maintained. And it's very clean. You can take a stroll along the stream. At night it's lighted up and it's a very beautiful scenery.
135,4.0,If there are no events at night . Would advise to go in the morning to see what are the writings on the wall
136,4.0,"A calm and relaxing atmosphere in the middle of the city.A lot of local couples go here to cool their feet in the water. You can just walk around and enjoy the atmosphere, or you can sit down and do the same, it's always a pleasure!"
137,3.0,"It is a nice stroll from Samil-daero or Myeongdong. But I found that I missed a lot of the above the ground sights if you stroll below. It is better to peer down from the cross bridges, and there were several of these."
138,4.0,"The Cheonggyecheon Stream isn't as scenic as the Yeouido Park, N Seoul Tower, but it is a great place to relax and chill, simply just to breathe in the fresh air and take photos."
139,5.0,Unique place and very creative! Love how korean people maximize their public place to be a tourist spot. Better visit at night for the light
140,5.0,"Loved this stream as it was located in the middle of the city in between roads and buildings. Seoul has done a great job in preserving its rich culture, heritage and nature amidst rapid globalization. We started off at the beginning of the stream near to City Hall or Gwanghwamun station. Walked all the way to Gwangjang market. A must-see destination."
141,5.0,"The way Seoul took advantage of their own city spaces is just amazing, and this stream is a must see. You definitively can´t miss it."
142,4.0,I would say this is actually one of the most memorable places we went to in seoul. Ot's such a relaxing place to just stay at when you've been tired all day walking around the city. Many locals seem to like this place too and this is a good place to chill at if you want to interact with the locals. You can dip your feet at the stream. Although I didnt try it.myself cause I was wearing shoes and didnt feel like taking them off I bet it's refreshing. Plus! This place is free no entrance fee or whatever.
143,5.0,This is a wonderful public space that was once a neglected area and had a freeway over it.  It was a major initiative to restore the health of this water and create a wonderful public space;  the project started a movement around Korea to restore unhealthy waterways.  I was there in the August heat and the shade created by the bridges is a great place to relax and take refuge from the hot sun.  It was a bit overgrown and needed some maintenance but it was enjoyable and I felt I was in a unique setting.  If you like interesting urban spaces I would recommend incorporating into your trip.
144,4.0,It's a long stream located near the DDP so you can plan your trip accordingly. I would say that it's a very nice place to take a stroll at especially at night because that is when the lights are switched on. Many couples hang out here.
145,4.0,"Start you journey from Gwanghwamun Sta. exit 5 (subway) and find a river down from the street. The river start from the waterfall. It happens to be the source of the water that along for many kilometers onward. This is great when you walk and sit around first 1km, spent the time to stroll along the river but actually you can walk far more than 1km to another area but the view lesser nice walking away from the starting poin.Anyway it was a good place, when the evening comes ... the lights turned on, than you'll have another environment. Good place to photo as well."
146,3.0,Its a nice little stream in the middle of the city. Dont plan to walk the entire stream since its pretty long. Do visit it in a combination  with insadong and Gwanghwamun Square. A nice trip is Gwanghwamun Square - Gyeongbokgung Palace - Bukchok Hanok village - Changeokgung Palace - Insadong -  Cheonggyecheon Stream
147,5.0,"This was a great idea to unearth/un concrete this stream and turn it into an urban water park - below the streets.  It is lushly landscaped, kid friendly, and in some places, so quiet.  A MUST SEE!"
148,3.0,"My local friend brought me here. It's a stream running through the city. Only locals come here to hang out, and Thts exactly what we did. The stream is flowing with fishes. You will see many people coming here with their children or couples Jst sitting around having chats. It's a place to chill ."
149,5.0,"Great place to walk around, especially at night.  Very safe.  Lots of couples walking around.  Spots to sit by the stream.  You can cross it at several locations.  Nice way to spend an hour or so."
150,5.0,I visited Korea when there was a lampion festival. We can enjoy the festival alongside the stream. So beautiful.
151,5.0,The walking beside the stream is very relaxing. During both morning or night you will be happy to be there.
152,3.0,"It's a stream below road level in the middle of a busy downtown area. Its like Paris gone wrong. Its a tiny stream that is carved out in the middle of mainstream Downton main road because it used to exist earlier. To me it's an oddity. However, it must be nice for those who live there. It seems to be imposed and not organic to its surroundings."
153,5.0,The water river is so clear and the place is beautiful during the night. I just can't stop staring into this river.
154,4.0,"This is a nice stroll to take at night, lots of artworks and interesting spots to take photos. It looks safe, and there are stores to shop around the area, If you are coming from Dongdaemon and going to Insadong this is the best route to take."
155,5.0,"In the midst of high building and city noises, cheongecheon provides an area of rest and tranquility for those needing a break. Its a lovely walk to take whether day or night, or simply go there to dunk your feet in the water for some relaxation. Its a place where you can go with your friends, family, lover or even alone for some peace. I highly recommend this place."
156,5.0,This is a wonderful part of Seoul. Visit during spring and fall and you can enjoy the many restaurants and shops in the area.
157,5.0,"This stream is a great place to stroll along, with lots of places to sit down along the way. You can also cross over the stream over stepping stones at many locations. It is also a great place to go for a run, especially early in the morning when it is deserted."
158,5.0,"You can rather go with friends to do a small walk or also if you enjoy running go there.There's allways people walking, but running almost always foreigners. Among the way you'll find some fitness machines designed to help olders be fit ( you van use them no matter your age for free)!!!"
159,4.0,It's really amazing that such a place just a few meters below street level can really have a different feeling.
160,5.0,"I went there twice, once during the day and another time during the night. During the day it's really enjoyable. Even on a hot day you can cool yourself down by holding your legs into the stream. But don't walk around in it, the security(?) will whistle you our ^^ During the night you might bring a date. The lights are really romantic and if you go alone you might feel lonely between all the couples xD"
161,4.0,"I visited Cheonggyecheon Stream with a friend the other night. It's a nice place to get away from the heat and bustle of Seoul. You can walk on street level above the stream or down below. Everything seems well lit, and even under the bridges it's not the least bit unsafe feeling. There are a bunch of stores and restaurants nearby. One note: it's a long stream, so getting directions there can be confusing. We went to Dongdaemun station and walked from there: it's very close by. (Although I'm sure there are other transportation options.)"
162,2.0,"This idea is brilliant and genius I love it.Then, the uneven pavement is just horrible and the bush is a total eye sore!They should really put more effort into making it a garden park alike zone."
163,3.0,"i visited this place last 2014 and i just wanted to rate it. We came right out of Insadong for some shopping and we could not figure out where we wanted to go next, so we just walked and walked until we saw the Seoul Tower. Funny as it may seem, we walked towards it like kids not even thinking about how far that place is and how high it was situated. :D So on our way there we saw this stream. I saw it somewhere while researching for itineraries so i joyfully pointed there and went there for some pictures. It was very nice seeing a clean stream in the middle of a heavily populated and progressive city. It's truly a touch of nature in the city! I would definitely recommend for you to visit this when it's near a place you are going :) Plus i heard there are times that this stream is decorated  with lights :)"
164,4.0,Nice and serenity place to hang out with your love one.You should find the stone with heart-shaped. There's a lot of fun and romantic too.
165,3.0,"Unfortunately, nothing special wad there while both of times me being tat this place. But the place is kind of romantic to spend time with your sweetheart."
166,5.0,"This place is good to enjoy a walk with your partner, family or friends. The scenery is rather romantic at night with all the lights and the waterfall area is a nice place to chill, just listening to the sound of water is calming. Very popular spot with tourists and locals."
167,4.0,"If you have had your fill at Gwangjang Night Market, or are waiting for the all night shopping in Dongdaemun, you might enjoy a walk along the Cheonggyecheon Stream. This stream, although man made, runs through many interesting neighbourhoods of Seoul and ends near the square of King Sejong the Great and Gyeongbukgung Palace. I would recommend walking along the stream at night, as you can sometimes find street musicians set up under the many bridges, or come to view the beautiful lights and waterfall near the end of the stream. If you walk down the street from Dongdaemun or Gwangjang your way will be illuminated by many of the lights, and you will be dazzled once you reach the end and can view the square with the Palace and statue of Sejong the Great."
168,5.0,"During my time in Seoul I loved to take walks down the stream, it's romantic during night and I loved the sound of water. In June there is a festival that takes place there."
169,4.0,Taking a walk along here is a relaxing way to spend your day. It's located city central and is a very easy and peaceful walk
170,5.0,"The stream starts with a lovely fountain where you can get nice pics. Take some snacks with you, walk down the stream and chill in the sun or shadow enjoying the water cooling your feet. The stream is really long and not worth walking all the way down, just take a metro or taxi when you have get enough of walking."
171,4.0,It is such a pretty place to stroll. Not do pleasant if it's on a very hot day though. Go in the evenings. On the weekends you get to listen to talented buskers singing. Quite a romantic spot for couples too.
172,4.0,"A nice place for a stroll and a rest by the stream. Lots of couples and families enjoying the outdoors, feeding the fish and dangling their feet in the stream. Some nice places for photos as well. Surrounding shops and cafes  looked interesting, but we didn't have time to explore."
173,5.0,"I went there during night time while holding a hot toffe nut latte in hand. It was breezy and cold. Walked with my friend along the stream and crossed the stream on man made stones. There are lights lit in the waters, and nice landscapes to be enjoyed. A nice place to walk on during winter nights. Thumbs up!"
174,5.0,I enjoyed the walking path - located nearby Myeongdong. One could consider taking a stroll on a cooling evening to enjoy the pretty lights and peaceful stream along the path.
175,5.0,"Among many things we can do during the summer night, taking a walk along the Cheonggyecheon Stream is one of the most recommended activities. Gentle breeze cool down the late night heatwave of the metropolitan city. If you want something very unique activity, you can borrow hanbok, traditional Korean costume from the K-Style Hub, located near the beginning point of the Cheonggyecheon and walk along the stream. You will be the focus of photographers and visitors."
176,5.0,"a nice break from the hustle and bustle of myeongdong. go for an evening stroll, lots of locals do it too."
177,5.0,"To get a rest, to walk among, to take pictures. We even saw a heron that looks to be a resident in there!"
178,5.0,Love it....its just near by with Dongdaemun free ease to move around n shopping mallVery scenic view of stream n very clean ever i've seen..Love it..
179,4.0,Visited the stream at night. There's a lot of resting area which is perfect for hang out and gather after dinner. Loads of trees which keep the place green and relaxing in the city centre.
180,5.0,Historical yet modern spot to chill and relax or just do a selfie session and walk along the stream path. One of my fave spot in Seoul. Still very windy on early May though for you who cams from tropical country don't forget to bring your jacket.
181,4.0,"Not really a stream. More like a canal with sidewalk on the side and street art. If you happen to be walking in the area, you might as well walk along the ""stream"" instead of street level. I read that sometime, there are festivals there and at night, it is lit up. I was there on a regular day so I was not that impressed."
182,5.0,Lovely place to wander for a stroll in the middle of bustling Seoul.  Loved the relaxed environment and although it is fully man-made it was still a peaceful place to relax in.
183,5.0,"it was very glad to see a river in the center of the city, with small waterfall and many color lamp and cold and clean water there, so peacefull"
184,5.0,"A beautifully done water stream, in the middle of city center, just behind the city hall with kilometers of walking path, both sides. In some places, it is possible to cross the stream and walk back or climb up to the road. It is always crowded, well lighted and very safe.  It's a place to relax, walk, listen to music and to chill out while watch beautiful people. ~! One of the most visited spots in Seoul."
185,4.0,"I went during the Lotus lantern festival in May, and the area was lit up at night with glowing lantern artwork.Even if you miss that, I think the area is nice for a walk and a coffee."
186,5.0,"Since I was there during the lantern festival, the Stream was decorated with lanterns and there were many lantern platforms on the water. Nice stroll in the business area"
187,5.0,"if you want to just take a walk without being bumped by fast street-goers, better come to this place at night and feel the cold air.."
188,4.0,We only covered a short distance after walking from the palace. Its a nice place to have an ice-cream :)
189,5.0,This man-made stream starts in central Seoul with an attractive waterfall and extends for about 11 kilometres with numerous bridges.  It's a good place to relax or walk. Certainly a successful and attractive project.
190,4.0,How nice to walk along this lovely  tranquil stream and watch the fish in the middle of busy Seoul. Only problem when we were there was the midges .
191,3.0,"its pretty cool how this used to be a waterway, and then it's being transformed into a pretty stream. go there for a short rest after all your shopping."
192,5.0,This stream which stretches for miles across Seoul .Went there at sundown and walked along the promenade on the sides.very relaxing place .At night there are light shows at vantage points.On exiting this place there are a lot of restaurants and shopping places to visit too.Very beautiful attraction in Seoul!
193,4.0,"this place often holds events. It is very romantic for couples , and very cosy to chat with friends.Great to take photos.  There is a lot of places where you can sit too. But be aware when night falls , I would suggest to have a good mosquitoes repellent , it is seriously a pain."
194,4.0,"A little too hot in the day, but nice to just stroll by if you happen to be in the area at night. Not much in the way of street activities though, compared to other riverfront precincts."
195,5.0,What a fun place to walk around during the day and especially at night.  Most cities don't have anything like it.
196,5.0,"Spot families, couples, and friends strolling this accessibly stream.We walked here from Gwangchang Market. A pity we didn't finish walking the entire stream."
197,4.0,"Although it's great for a walk or for jogging, the vegetation around needs urgently a hand. Come here for the sunset or at night when the lights dim with the bridges. Also a picnic here would be a super romantic date."
198,5.0,this stream run through seoul. many people come here to relax or meet friends. also its recommend place for dating where you can see many couples hanging out and street musicians play on their guitars. at night they have light show on water
199,5.0,"Really beautiful stream in the middle of the city! Great place for a short or long walk, enjoying all the art all over the place. I went there during day time, which is a pity, because I bet it would be something really amazing at evening."
200,4.0,"We stumbled across this walk on our way to a supermarket in the evening, plenty of people enjoying a stroll alone, with SO or friends."
201,4.0,"Cheonggyecheon is among the places where both, tourists and locals enjoy having fun. Especially, on the nights, you will see lots of couples walking around, so if you are looking to have some peace from the busy city of Seoul, this is the spot.If you go around the whole stream, it will take you close to an hour, but overall it is worth the walk.If you go on the daytime, it is more quiet as there is a lot of elders walking around."
202,4.0,"This is shallow stream about 15~20 feet wide, with walking paths on each side, connected by several small small bridges spaced out along its length.  It cuts through a major part of the city, following the path of a natural stream that was at one time covered up by concrete and later uncovered to make this attraction.  At Christmas time and other festival times, the city makes light displays here that are quite nice.  Then, I would say this is for sure a place to come and take a few pictures.  At other times, it is a just a calmer place to walk - no cars, traffic lights etc.  Generally speaking, I think the nicest time to walk here is in the evening, when they turn on the everyday lights (under the water, and along the pathway).  It might be a nice simple break after a busy day of sight seeing, and after a nice dinner.  You could just walk a little ways, and sit for a while with a coffee (when it is a bit warmer).  Kids might be entertained for a short while, but it is more of a place an adult might appreciate.I have visted in summer and winter.  It the summer time when it is hot, it feels a little cooler walking beside the water.  In certain sections there are bushes and trees that give some shade.  Many sit on the edge and put their feet in for a while.  In the winter time / colder times of the year, it is not as appealing, because the bushes and trees are brown, and the stone is a little chilly to sit on, so you are not so inclined to mozy along and relax. You could possibly take this walk/coffee break in connection with a concert at the nearby Sejong Arts Center, or in connection with a tour of the nearby main palace (10~15 minute walk from the main starting point). The Myeongdong shopping area is nearby as well."
203,5.0,"Walking along the paths by the Stream just before Christmas with lights and light shows is an unforgettable experience. It is very popular with Koreans who come to take photos, meet friends and enjoy the carnival atmosphere. Originally this was a run-down area but it is now one of the not-to-be missed sights of Seoul."
204,4.0,"The stream is a good visit for a morning or a couple of hours in the afternoon. You can start near the city hall and walk all the way to the East. There's different parts with some more nature feel or modern urban feel. What I missed was the connection to the street and maybe some places to have a drink. But see this as a nice quiet stroll along the river, that happens to be in the middle of the city"
205,3.0,"Nothing spectacular except when there are decorations or particular themes being displayed at Cheonggye Plaza/at the start of the stream. If it's on your way from one attraction to another, it's worth a quick stop for some photography."
206,3.0,"It's a cool place to walk by if you happen to be nearby, mainly at night. Not necessary to walk all of it, with just a Km you can appreciate it more than enough."
207,3.0,"We chanced upon the place on our way to Dongdaemum. Earlier, our host has advised us against going there as there is nothing much in winter and he's right! However it offers another type of tranquillity and charm in the busy city area with its half frozen stream and spacious walkway. Worth a drop by if it's on the way but would not have purposely make a trip there during winter months or when there is no ongoing festival."
208,4.0,"Even if you just want to take a walk across the stream, you will reach other part of seoulwithout having any Idea. Mak sure to check it out during Lantern Festival (it looks fab espacially for kids)"
209,3.0,"The Cheonggyecheon Stream is definitely best seen at night. I went in January (windy, cold, unpleasant) and during the day. There wasn't much to see and had I not been in the area already, I would have been highly disappointed."
210,4.0,"Went a couple of days before Christmas, so it was lit up nicely with many lights (snowflakes, flowers etc.) There were so many couples! The waterfall at the end was also very pretty."
211,5.0,Amazing place in Christmas! It's decorated with a lot of beautiful lights even if you go not in Christmas you will also enjoy it!
212,5.0,"Took this walk for the first time last Labor Day 2015. I was all alone, but thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Would highly recommend it to anyone. good walk with a friend or girlfriend, also for anyone interested in Korean history."
213,2.0,"I know it had the best of intentions, but it's not that nice. It's rather random exhibits sponsored by various countries."
214,5.0,"This is a great place to visit for a relaxing afternoon. The stream has many lovely shops and restaurants next to it. During the warmer months, you can sit and put your feet in the stream. I have been many times and I enjoy it without fail."
215,3.0,"The photos definitely make this look nicer than it is. There were unlit Christmas lights and figures which were still in the stream, which took away from the experience. It would prob be cooler at night. The wishing well was cool, and so were the stepping stones. But it was underwhelming compared to the photos."
216,5.0,"I went to Cheonggyeochon Stream during spring season and it is located near Dongdaemun. At first, I just accidentally saw this places in the afternoon and it is really beautiful. When night came, I visited this river once again and it's still as awesome as you can imagine. The water is really clear and you can just sit on the bench of the river and put your foot in the water, it might be simple but it's sooo refreshing! you can see many couple spending time near this river because somehow this place brings you a romantic feels :D a must visit in Seoul!"
217,3.0,"Took a walk at this peaceful and calm stream with a friend. It is located very near to Dongdaemun shopping complex, Pyeonghwa market and Dongdaemun market. Took some pictures and enjoyed the peacefulness and calmness of the stream. Not to miss this stream if you are nearby Dongdaemun shopping complex."
218,4.0,Its an amazing feat having a clean and clear stream at the center of a busy city. We had a walk on this famous stream in the morning and it felt really good. The sounds of the water and the man-made water falls really calms you down. The water is so clean in fact we saw Koi and other fishes. Our Tour guide told us that it's better to visit the place at night especially during summer where there are lots of people just hanging around. Worth visiting !!!
219,5.0,AMAZING! DAEBAK! BEAUTIFUL! I suggest you should visit the stream at night or more good if u visit on Christmas or the latern festival! Romantic and really beautiful!

224,5.0,"Before my visit to Seoul, many friends have recommended visiting this stream. So I set aside half a day to visit this stream. It's a beautiful stream situated in the middle of a city. It was nice to walk along the stream to just relax and take a break from the busy days in Seoul. I walked along the stream right up till the waterfall where the stream began and where everyone there was taking photographs with the waterfall.Recommended to anyone who would wanna take a breather from all the busy streets and see a long beautiful stream."
225,4.0,"Cheonggyecheon Stream was once a dirty river, now it is the main attraction of Seoul. This place is beautiful day and night. U are lucky if u travel in November during a lantern festival. It must be so beautiful at night."
226,4.0,This is an easy walk from the palace on the way to Myeongdong and some time should be spent here. There is a Lantern festival whole of November so that's a bonus.
227,5.0,This place is a must see place when you visit seoul especially at night. This place is near seoul city hall and city hall subway station. Many young people go this place at night to hang out whether with friend or with their couples. Often you will see a bazaar held in this place also music performance by locals.
228,4.0,"This stream is less natural than many think - water is pumped into it from elsewhere. Still, and despite lots of concrete, it makes a nice break from the crowded urban surroundings. Part of it is a wetland and it seems to have attracted quite a lot of wildlife considering where it is."
229,5.0,This place is definitely on top of my fave place in Seoul. The river is the best place to have a break after a long walk around Seoul or around the markets... Kekeke

233,4.0,Visit on November and you will witness more of the stream's beauty with the lantern display during the festival. Nice to stroll around and then head at Gwajang market for some street foo to taste.
234,5.0,Perfect place for a walk. Must see when in Seoul. At night it's all lighted up in magnificent colors. You can get good food by the sides of the stream and wonderful bars with good service. It gets really cold on autumn and winter! Be prepared.
235,4.0,"Obviously, as the name goes, it is a stream, but it makes for an enjoyable walk. It is quiet, and at night the lights give it a different feeling, that during the day is lacking. Good though for a run outside the busy roads and streets."
236,4.0,"Near dongdaemun market, dongdaemon design plaza, and JW Marriot Seoul Hotel. Cool, quite and romantic river in the middle of city. how to get here, please go by subway or metro line 4 stop at dongdaemun station exit 8 😊"
237,4.0,"On a Saturday evening as dusk starts to fall, I find myself walking with local friends showing me the famous Cheonggyecheon Stream in downtown Jongno-gu in Seoul.The place is a buzz with people of all ages enjoying the walking and art.The stream was created in 2005 as an urban renewal project to bring water, trees and art to the community.It is now a great success with many interesting displays of art in the stream, on its banks and interactive art works for the kids to enjoy.A great place to wander on a sunny day for a few hours."
238,5.0,One of the best place in Seoul. The water stream is so relaxing. I can never imagine there's a place like this within the Metro. Don't miss this.
239,3.0,"nothing special to describe this place, just a nice place to take a rest after a long walking day. Too Dark, i think need to put more street lamps."
240,4.0,Do check it out if you are in the area during evenings. Pretty with the lighting and good for an after dinner walk.
241,4.0,We passed by during the day and thus did not see the wonderful lights but it was equally pleasant. The stream was nice to stroll along and relax.
242,4.0,And to think that at one time this stream was covered up... This is now - after early 21st century project completion  - a beautiful and unusually appointed urban space. Lovely place to stroll and relax. During our Seoul stay it housed a recycled art exhibit and on a sunny October day our stroll was breathtaking beautiful!
243,5.0,I came here after Gwanghwamun Square and Gyeongbokgung Palace. These place are in one area so you can reach all of them in the same day by walking to each other. Recommended!
244,5.0,"It's got to be my favourite place in the entire city of Seoul. Agnes and I were there in the late afternoon, we strolled along the stream for 2 hours and enjoyed the stream set against the sunset. It is absolutely beautiful. You'll have to see it for yourself ^^"
245,5.0,"I work just across the street from Cheonggye-cheon, and here are quick tips for 2-3 days tourists.1. If you are rushed by time, consider visiting here at night time. It's got a fine night view with lights on the buildings nearby.2. The stream itself is some miles long, but it's all artificial and the best part is the starting point.3. If you like tracking, you may consider walking through the stream from Gwanghwa-mun to Dongdae-mun, it would take about 30-40 mins normally.4. MOST IMPORTANT : Don't even try to get into the stream when it rains. The stream has a function of city sewerage for heavy rains, and it easily pours out especially in the summer. When it is closed, don't go, and when you see the rain, don't go downstairs.5. Drinking & Smoking is strictly prohibited : up to $100 fine"
246,5.0,"Came to this stream to see the annual lantern festival throughout the month of November. Warning, it place does get really crowded, be sure to arrive early so you can be one of the first people to walk through the lower level of the stream area. Unfortunately, when I came, it was extremely crowded and the line to go toward the lower level stretched for miles. Eventually after 30 minutes of waiting, we finally decided to leave. You can get a couple great shots from the upper level. Along the upper level, there are food carts aligned all over. I purchased grilled octopus and cuttlefish as a snack. If you're in the area, be sure to try some!This steam features other types of advertisements once the lantern festival came to an end, including latest technology mascots, etc. I definitely enjoy walking here when it's less crowded in order to enjoy the sights and for a late night stroll."
247,5.0,"I wished I had realised how close I was to the stream earlier.  We didn't head here until the last day of our visit in Seoul.  As it was Chuseok, they had the green umbrella's up and it was beautiful at night.  We took a few awesome photos and the weather was beautiful! There were a few buskers around as well to lighten the mood..."
248,5.0,"When i was young, 청계천 was covered under concrete road. Over decades it's created to the very new landmark of  city Seoul. I've witnessed all changes, newly made history. When i walk along side 청계천, i feel like time traveling. There are lots of cafeterias,restaurants,snack vendors, and constant events. You can enjoy  relaxed break time in the midst of very busy city life."
249,5.0,A wonderful example for al of us. How to get back to nature. The benefits for the city are enormous and a delight.
250,5.0,"How a central water feature can enhance any city! This is also the case for this canal, inaugurated on October 1st 2005.We saw the stream in the day-time and there were people around (tourists, passers-by, office workers taking a break) and we saw it at night, all lit up, and it was even busier with couples and families enjoying a little rest and unwinding.The stepping stones and the wishing well are great fun  and it was a pleasant rest from the busy city.Highly recommended for the ambiance.Try to see it in November if you can; we were told about a Lantern Festival then."
251,4.0,"We dropped by before heading to the palace. It was great place for photo taking. Sit by the stream, it is quite relaxing & calming. There were cute umbrellas hanging above and some parts of the stream."
252,4.0,"Pragmaticly married a storm-controlled facility with natural environment and creative architecture. The stream resided within the busy city-centre, yet a stroll along the stream return you to quiet  nature without the noise of city automobiles."
253,4.0,Always love the evening stroll throughout this stream. The colourful lights and the breezy wind bring you at peace.
254,5.0,"Beautiful huge stream that stretches through the city. Worth seeing during the day, but walking along it at night is a must. Starts with a waterfall at the west end and meanders across the city with trees and small parks as it goes along. Very vibrant area at night, lots of people, always exciting and beautiful things going on."
255,4.0,This was a nice way to walk if you want to get away from the crowds.  Not sure I  would walk alone at night.
256,5.0,"Took a stroll along this stream on our way to Insa-Dong. What a beautiful mid city experience. Clean, fresh water, dragon flies and damsel flies and filled with fish. Stepping stones at regular intervals enable crossing. Well marked with exits for orientation. Add to your must do list."
257,4.0,A lovely place to stroll through the city. In the fall there is a Lantern Festival that is lovely and definitely worth a visit.
258,4.0,Thsi was one of the highlights for us while we were in seoul. It was so relaxing to just take a stroll along the river and see the light show and the artwork along the walls. It's a nice break from the running from store to store. The lightshow is also something I would definitely recommend for everyone that has the chance to see it
259,5.0,We absolutely loved this spot! I would have gone there every day if I could! I loved that it seem to be full of locals as well and just so beautifully relaxing. Definitely a wonderful place to cool off your tired feet from all of the walking and hiking you will likely be doing in the city.
260,5.0,A beautiful and relaxing experience right in the middle of Seoul.  It used to be a belt highway and the city converted it into a walking stream.  Worth every penny.
261,4.0,"I really like this place, it's beautiful. basically it's an artificial (?) river in the center of seoul and it's a very good place to chill and hang out with your loved ones. you can also find street musicians performing here at night."
262,5.0,Very lovely place to go and walk around and relax. Very peaceful and beautiful. We went during the day although I wish we had stayed to watch the sunset and the lights come on. Very close to dongdaemun plaza which is also definitely worth visiting.
263,4.0,"Interesting to see how many people congregate under the many bridges simply wasting time, eating or playing various instruments."
264,5.0,This must be one of the best urban rehabilitation projects anywhere in the world.  You can walk for miles/km through wonderful greenery from Kwanghwamun all the way to Dongdaemoon and beyond.  Every city should have something like this.
265,4.0,"Cheonggyecheon stream effectively divides various neighborhoods of Seoul, and the amazing thing is that many subway stations are situated around the stream itself. Just to name a few, Jonggak, Jongno-3-ga, and other Jongno stations, Dongdaemun station and so on. While the festivities around the stream area are mostly in summer time or the beginning of September in the fall, and around the Jonggak and City hall areas, you can effectively stroll along the stream from the source at City Hall station, and then walk all the way to Dongdaemun from there, which takes a few hours, if you like to walk slowly. Otherwise, you can just sit down at a corner along the stream, soak your tired feet in the cooling water in summer and fall, or have an open-air picnic with friends around that area."
266,5.0,"Bench marked from San Antonio's Riverwalk, except the riverside restaurants so less crowded by restaurants but feels more artifical place than Riverwalk. Actually the water comes from the mountains in north of Seoul and in old days this place was stream for everyday people's use. it's a nice place for having a short walk during lunch hour and enjoy an urban life differently."
267,5.0,The stream is very peaceful at night I enjoy it immensely I come here often especially in the summer nights
268,4.0,The Restoration is an example of urban life. It is well designed and you can also try your luck with throwing coins into a specific place. There are a large number of youth and couples hanging around and some bands are playing music. A good place to stay for a while.
269,4.0,"It's a great way to cross the roads via the stream like an underpass, where you get to enjoy the breeze and hear the sound of the flowing stream. You get to step on stones to get across, interesting activity for kids and the young at heart."
270,4.0,"Cheonggyecheon stream is a little piece of heaven in the middle of the bustling metropolis of Seoul. Down by the stream, if it weren't for the tall buildings you can see above you, you could well believe that you're in the Korean countryside next to a babbling brook. There are some large rocks in the middle of the stream, which make for a wonderful photo opportunity if you take the time to climb onto one of them. If you have time, walk down to the southern end of the stream and up to the bridge over the stream to see the statue of Jeon Tae-il (Chŏn T'ae-il), the 22-year-old labor activist who set himself on fire to protest the appalling conditions for workers under the dictatorship of Park Chung-hee in 1970. At the north end of the stream, check out Dongdaemun, the Great East Gate of Seoul. There are also some interesting side streets near Dongdaemun that will give you a feel of Korea before the great industrialization launched by Park Chung-hee."
271,5.0,"One November evening, my friend took me here to see the lantern festival and I was totally blown away. It was so beautiful, but because of all the lanterns, I have no idea what the actual stream looks like, but its a lovely area for a nighttime stroll."
272,3.0,There were breeding mosquitoes everywhere. But still it's a nice place for you to sit down by the stream under several bridges.
273,5.0,"Visited this place twice. First time was on 1st March, it looks peaceful and beautiful and weather was great for a stroll. Went back again on November, it was towards the end of their lantern festival. The entire length of the stream was decorated with beautiful gigantic lanterns of historic characters. Very beautiful indeed. Highly recommend to visit at least once if you are in Seoul."
274,4.0,We stumbled upon this stream on a night out in the downtown area and it was stunning when lit up after dark. There are points where you can cross by bridge or by steps so it's quite fun to walk down. Really impressive!
275,5.0,"We had our hotel around this area and we used to go for walks around the stream on evenings. This seems to be a popular place for the locals as well and is definitely a teenager dating spot for the locals. You get really nice pictures here after the sunset when the light turn on and theres always music playing as well. Nice and peaceful in the middle of the hub of the city. Lots of food joints, restaurants, cafes and shops around."
276,4.0,"Walk in the side of the stream, is nice while enjoy the scene. It's a long walk, so if you wants to enjoy the stream, don't forget to prepare your walking shoes and camera. It's beautiful in day or night. A lot of people enjoy the beauty of the stream."
277,4.0,"You'll hear some Koreans talk about Cheonggyecheon as if it's one of the wonders of the world, which is going a bit far, but it is a very pleasant place, right in the heart of the city, to take a walk and get a bit of something more natural than concrete and steel. It's particularly nice in the evenings when it's very prettily illuminated. It's easier to appreciate the local fondness for it if you remember what was here before. When I first came to Korea, the Cheonggyecheon development was just beginning, and at that time a congested street and an overpass stood where now there is a stream, trees, ducks, and people strolling contentedly in the sunshine. It's a spectacular improvement."
278,3.0,"Unusually and interesting place to see.  People sitting around enjoying each other company and the hear the soothing sound of running stream.  Colorful lanterns lit the stream below.Careful because the ""walkways"" are uneven, you can trip.People also come here to drink and eat.  I must say they do take their rubbish with them.What a wonderful idea!"
279,4.0,"this is quite close to the myeongdong area; and we just walked down from the street and sat near the stream. its nice and clean, and peaceful. you can just sit here by the stream and relax a little. something great to have in a city"
280,4.0,"We decided to take a walk through the Cheonggyecheon Stream from Insadong Street and enjoy the scenery. It is quiet and clean area & at one point, we nearly forgotten that all this is right in the middle of the bustling city, not rural area. The water was very clear and we saw fishes swimming upstream, as well as a pair of ducks foraging for food. It was daytime then and we were told that by night, there will be more activities going on. There are some events going on, so check the calendars with the information center for the schedule."
281,4.0,The stream is located right near the Dongdaemun Night Market area so it makes a nice area to just stop and relax with coffee after a long night of shopping and drinking!
282,4.0,Its a place to relax and take a dip in the stream. The water was cool n crystal clear. Enjoy you coffee while the stream right in front of you.
283,4.0,"Cheonggyecheon Stream has a remarkable history.  Originally, it was a stream that drained a good part of old Seoul, eventually surrounded by shacks and primarily fouled by sewage.  At the headwaters at the western end was Mugyodong, which was a hive of cheap eateries and bars, that served as meeting locations for student anti-government organizers.  The prior Park Chung-hee fascist government solved the eyesore and political agitation center by paving over the stream and building Korea's first long-distance overpass.  Eventually the overpass started to become a dated, crumbling example of average urban planning while the concrete buildings built along the sides of the paved-over stream started to become increasingly ugly structures.The remarkable solution was to tear down the overpass and tear out the pavement to recreate the original stream with fresh water.  The water that flows through the stream is not natural but pumped into the system from the Han River to the south with the wanter eventually returning to the Han River upstream.The project has received several well-deserved international awards for creative urban renewal.  At the same time, it has been criticized by urban archeologists in how the project more or less bulldozed through several important sites in the reconstruction.  There was some attention made to the historical value of discoveries, but not adequately so in many historians' perspectives.Regardless, today the stream is a real joy for Seoul denizens and visitors alike.  In most seasons, the stream is particularly a joy to visit in the early morning hours or at dusk and into the evening when the architectural lighting found at the west end headwaters at and near Chedongycheon Plaza, near Gwanghwamun, is truly beautiful.Often special events - both cultural and political - are held at the Plaza, so it often seems there is always something happening there.  And during the hotter months of summer, one can find individuals, dating couples and even young families literally cooling their heels like Korean Tom Sawyers and Huck Finns under the various bridges.   Watching kids and adult wade about, one can almost forget one is in the very middle of one of the world's largest cities."
284,3.0,"I visited a few days ago (late May 2015). My (local) friend took me there, making a stop over at a monument erected for Jeon Tae-il (d. 1970), a South Korean worker and workers' rights activist who committed suicide by burning himself to death at the age of 22 in protest of the poor working conditions in South Korean factories. His death was a catalyst for the labor union movement in S. Korea.Learning about his life and death was more memorable than our walk by the stream, which was full of gnats, and a little hot in the middle of the day. Unless you're close by, or visiting Pyeonghwa market, I wouldn't make a trip out just for this place."
285,3.0,"If your near gwanghwamun, it's a nice detour. Some years ago the city renovated this stream which was a polluted dumping ground. Now It's a nice place to have a lunch along the stream. Be aware that there are a lot of bugs (flying gnat like bugs) all over the stream area in the spingI don't go out of my way to go there because, while it's nice, it's not that big a deal. If you go by the entrance near gwanhwamun where they have the man made water fall it's pretty. Take a few pictures, have a light lunch then move on. It's only interesting there when there is a festival like the lantern festival where they set up beautiful lantern displays along the stream."
286,5.0,"This place is one of my favourite! This is good mixture of nature scenery, fresh air and the busy city. It is so relaxing every time. I really envy the Seoul citizens they have this place. I visited it at the day time - it is a refreshing place at the hot sunny days. At night it is full of musians and installations, so it is also lots of fun."
287,3.0,It's ok but I wouldn't go out of you way to visit this.  Maybe it's the time of year I visited but there wasn't much water in it! Might be nicer at night when it is lit up.
288,5.0,Just what you want to see in the middle of a bustling metropolis!  A nice change of pace down by the stream. Take a stroll to contrast the hustle and bustle of Myeongdong
289,4.0,"This place is in the travel book of Korea. Its center of town. Near City Hall, Myeongdong and so on. Easy to go by subway. I went there by subway stop at City Hall Station then walk along the road and taken photo. Here always have event and workshop. A lot of tourist. So I think you should visit here at least one time when you are travel in Korea."
290,3.0,Many people walk along the stream and stopby. Take off your shoes and soak ur feet into the stream water. The icing cool sensation relax ur tired feet after a long walk or exploring Seoul. There's wishing pool where u can make a wish.
291,5.0,"A stroll in a park with clean and calm water, nice place to walk and feel the cool breeze of the metro"
292,4.0,"Actually I just walk by but this design really attract me a lot , nice ! And lovely ! Some details like the flowers, rock, and water...."
293,4.0,I was there early morning & it was quiet.  Took about 20 mins to walk from my hotel.  The lower part of the stream were not maintained with grasses growing wildly so at first I could not believe that it was the place.  As I walked further up & saw the mini water fall & only then.  It would be nice to see you in the evening but I didn't have the time.  At least I know where it is & will visit in during the nite next time am in Seoul.
294,5.0,"It is was great to end the day walking along this stream by night. It is relaxing,romantic, and it is free! What else can you ask for."
