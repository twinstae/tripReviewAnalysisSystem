1,5.0,"We trekked up the Bukhansan as part of a team building activity and it surely worked. The trail starts right from the bottom (although there is a way to drive up halfway), and it starts very gently at first, with walkways past narrow streams and wooden bridges.But once you cross the Buddha temple halfway true, the 2nd half of the journey to the top is what needs more skill & teamwork.We had the added challenge of rain once we reached the top, so our journey down was even more challenging & worth the fun.Overall, the visit is a must do, for kids & adults alike, for beginners & pro climbers alike."
2,5.0,"Every time I am in Seoul, I always try to go hiking in Bukhansan National Park.  It is easily accessible by trains and buses.  This time I took Bus #704 in front of my hotel to Bukhansanseong (Fortress) Entrance.  On the way it stopped at Gupabal Station, where many hikers got on the bus.Bukhansan is a rocky mountain.  After the Bukhansanseong Information Center there are two choices: an intermediate course and an expert course.  I chose the latter toward Uisangbong (Uisang Peak).  At several places, there are steel cables to help you go up the steep granite.  At some places you have a nice view of parts of Seoul.Rather than going up to Daenammun (Great South Gate), I made a loop of four hours.  Near the end is Deog-am-sa (Virtuous Rock Temple), whose main hall with three Buddha statues is in a stone cave, which is the templeâ€™s unique feature.I look forward to going on another hike at Bukhansan."
3,5.0,"The trail is easy to follow on the trail map and is also in English. The trail starts out easy to go to the summit, but evolves to a moderate rock climb. Hiking boots are recommended for the portion of the trails that take you to the summit with the Korean flag at the top. There are many trails, but this is just the experience that i had. Bring a backpack with water and food to eat on the flat stone when you reach the top. Remember there be many others on this trail as it is very popular."
4,4.0,"During my last visit to Seoul with my wife, we decided to hike Bukansan National Park. Getting to the park/mountain was super easy via metro/subway then one bus ride to the entrance of the park. Though the path is well marked, and signs are clear, please keep in mind that it's pretty strenuous hike if you wish to get up to the top/summit. I hike on a regular basis in Colorado (various trails in the Rockies), I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at the level of difficulty. If you're not in shape or would prefer an easier route, please choose a beginner route, but keep in mind that final .5KM or so is difficult no matter what path you take as it involves climbing up the granite face. However, there are metal ropes that will assist you. I highly recommend this great treasure. I plan to visit again during my next visit."
5,4.0,"Extensive network of well-groomed trails, with English on maps and signs. Some steep sections can be hard to complete for unfit people, or when ice-up. Many users even on a winter weekday with marginal weather, so expect tons of people on a nice springtime weekend!"
6,5.0,Tallest mountain in Seoul.  Popular mountain hike place.  Be prepare to spend at least half day to go the peak.  Outstanding view of City of Seoul.  Many international travalers in th peak.  Better to go a weekday and week ends are crowded with locals.
7,4.0,Beautiful park and very large area mountain walks and restaurants . Good parking avail el and well managed .
8,5.0,A beautiful National Park. A bit of a challenge to get there as a Tourist as many locals have never set foot in it even though it is only a few minutes from Seoul. The Park is beautiful and quite wild. The baths are demanding but fun. There are a lot of Boulders to climb over and the paths are quite steep.
9,5.0,"I have been a Boy Scout leader in Seoul for the last nine years and have hiked Bukhansan dozens of time. This park is in fact my favorite hiking location and is one of the most hiked in Korea. The park is formed by two parallel mountain ridges with a steep valley between them. Hiking starts on paths at bottom of the mountains and go up to the ridges. Hikers then walk along the ridgeline enjoying the sights. Part of the old Seoul defensive wall runs along the ridgeline on the east side. Located north of the outskirts of Seoul, mass transit is available to several of the start point where outdoor stores and restaurants can be found. A day spent hiking the ridges of Bukhansan is a fine day indeed."
10,5.0,"I love hiking and I had planned to do it. I was going to join a tour group and pay about $150 for the hike, lunch, and Korean spa after. However, by the time I knew I could go, there were no more spots on the tour. So, I went by myself with public transportation. There are excellent articles on the Internet on how to go to the trail head on public transportation. The hike was  wonderful but challenging.  I had jet lag and did not have enough sleep, so it was very hard for me.  However, I see a lot of people do it, young and old, men and women, well equipped or causally equipped, all made it.  You must have enough water and pace yourself.  For most people, it is 2 hours up and 2 hours down. It is an extremely popular hike for the locals, so there will be people. It is unlikely that you will be lost if you just follow the trail. I did find a few cross-roads to be somewhat confusing at times and wished I had a guide at the moment. But I managed to make it to the top.  You are rewarded with an unparalleled view of Seoul."
11,5.0,"Its almost 60 kms out of the city and you might need to take 2 -3 transport to reach the place. It's a trekker's paradise but not totally out of reach for others. Yes the last 1 km is quite steep but once you reach the top you will realize its absolutely worth. Better to go in the morning so that you can reach on the top by lunch...take rest and back before 3pm. light clothes, trekking shoes and water."
12,4.0,"I had a wonderful day. But I was lost several times. There were no signs in English and I quickly lost the trail I intended to hike. But the scenery was beautiful and the first temple I came upon was stunning--with those iconic, jagged cliffs as a backdrop."
13,5.0,"Outstanding park, great views if no smog or fog. Clear sign-posting, useful to pick up map first though. Generally english signs at a reasonable frequency. Well maintained tracks"
14,5.0,"If you prefer to avoid tourist traps and would rather see what the locals do in their spare time, then this is for you. Other posts adequately describe how to locate the main park entrance gate from Dobongsan Railway station. You'll notice other train travellers all decked out in the latest hiking fashion. I'm told they are not so prevalent midweek, but on the weekends there was no doubt you were heading in the right direction. The main gate would not be more than 500 metres from the station. The short walk that can only be described as Innsbruck done Gangnam style. This area is worth the effort to see on its own. It is unique. The walk from the station is lined with shops and market stalls selling all range of hiking and outdoor gear. All you'll ever need and plenty that you won't. The locals obviously frequent these stores. I did the short loop walk as I arrived there to find it was raining, which caught me out. This loop is an easy walk, for anyone of reasonable fitness, of about 5.2 kms. It passes through natural forest settings and past a couple of Temples and their gardens. This walk is well sign posted and could be easily navigated even without knowledge of the Korean language. I'd recommend doing this walk early. Aiming at getting back to the entrance gate around 11-12 o'clock. Then sit back for something to eat and watch the endless parade of happy locals pass by you. A highlight of my trip."
15,5.0,Gorgeous views of Seoul and surrounding countryside. Also a really interesting hike featuring some historic Korean buildings.
16,5.0,Bukhansan national park is perfect for hiking with a beautiful monastery on top of the mountain. After noisy Seoul it felt so good to spend a day in the nature and climb to the monastery with wonderful views around. It is easy to reach from Seoul for a day trip.
17,4.0,"I went on this hike with a group of senior leaders in my organization. It was breathtaking ""literally"" as began elevating up the slope. The views of the temples and various statues of Buddha were gorgeous. Seeing the locals camp out along the streams made me appreciate the view much better. I thought to myself, if these old people can make it up these trails, I should have no excuse. We were limited on time as we only had a couple of hours to go as far as we could. My group took the harder trail heading toward one of the peaks. A day later, I must say my calves are kind of tight. All in all, I'm glad I went on this trek. Go see it for yourself if you get a chance!"
18,4.0,"It is so close to downtown but you can enjoy the feeling of outdoor and still get good foods around.  There are trails for hikers and you can enjoy the remnants of old dynasty markings and smell the natures.  Actually, there are many trails that you can enjoy short or long hikes and have access to main road to return easily.Watching sundown from Bukhansan offers great view and it is one of memorable experience I have."
19,4.0,"Always love to look over Seoul, and see the ever rapid spread of its boundaries southwards, and reaching into the future of the nation and people of the Land of the Morning Calm."
