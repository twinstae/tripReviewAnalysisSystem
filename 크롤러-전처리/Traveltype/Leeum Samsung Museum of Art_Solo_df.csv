0,5.0,"Lots of impressive eye candy in the form of lights and mirrors. The 3-D contemporary art is my favorite, and it delivered. The abstract expressionist stuff isn’t my thing, nor is the 12th century pottery. If you want semi-interactive 3-D art with a “wow” factor, this is the place!As with much art, the photos really don’t do it justice. Particularly with these pieces, I was amazed at how they changed as you moved around, which pictures can’t capture. Was 11,000 won/$9 US for entry with audio guide."
1,5.0,"While the collection is not enormous it is very high quality with works from virtually every noteworthy modern artist from the last hundred years. The audio guide (cheap at only one dollar) is excellent and covers every painting and sculpture. The collection is small enough that you can afford to devote some time with each piece and good enough that you'll want to. If you don't like modern art, then this may not be the museum for you.  The building is also stunning and at $10 its pretty cheap. So if you like modern art, or are curious and want to learn, then you could hardly do better than this wonderfull gallery!"
2,5.0,"It’s like 3 museums in one.  Leeum Samsung is divided into 3 sections, each of which was designed by a different architect (definitely watch the film in which they describe the intent of their design).  The spaces are unique and well used.  The art collection is nothing short of amazing.  A very high tech audio tour is available - definitely pay the extra.  It is well worth the money.  One of the best and most interesting museums I’ve ever visited."
3,5.0,"If you are interested in art, do not miss this museum. Beautiful collection of Korean art, and the building itself is quite beautiful."
4,4.0,Enjoyed the modern art at the Leeum Samsung museum.  The architecture is well done.  Loved the outside sculpture garden.  Great neighborhood to walk around afterwards.  Enjoyed the audio tape.
5,4.0,"A perfect retreat for a rainy day in Seoul, I got free entry with the Discover Seoul pass. Many interesting pieces on display, perhaps most striking is Anish Kapoor's signature metallic bubbles in the garden. Photography policy is abit confusing, at the entrance is says no photo's yet plenty of people were happily snapping away on mobile phones, whilst others were told off. Some European visitors were speaking loudly inside and staff did nothing to quieten them."
6,5.0,"Love museum 2:Beyond Sapce more than 1:Beyond Time, One of my favorite art at Public zone is ''Olafur Eliasson''Digital guide is really useful, and the rental cost 1,000won, quite cheap."
7,3.0,It has an interesting outdoor art piece comprising metal balls and an interesting internal staircase. There are numerous art pieces on display with some impressive ones. There is a fairly long walk (up a slope) from the nearest metro station; a surprise is a huge dog statue at the bottom of the slope but it is not part of the museum. The museum may suit someone with an interest in Korean art.
8,5.0,"In the middle of bustling Itaewon, the Leeum Samsung Museum of Art carves out a quiet respite from the city. There are a few large outdoor modern sculptures that you can photograph. These are also the only works in the museum that you're allowed to photograph.The walkway entrance to the museum immediately puts the visitor into a calm and tranquil state prior to passing through the doors. The traditional and ancient art, paintings, celadon vessels of Korea are located from the 4th floor down. They've kept the lighting very dim in the galleries to better highlight the exhibits. There is also a gallery of modern art on one side of the building that is a total contrast to the traditional galleries. These are vibrant, interesting and occasionally a little disturbing.I would recommend the audio guide as it provides greater details of the traditional exhibits. What's cool is you don't even need to touch the audio guide. It operates through Bluetooth and as you approach an exhibit case, the guide will automatically start to describe the exhibit you are in front of. I spent a few delightful hours here ... and then later walked down to a cute bakery, the Glamorous Penguin for coffee and cake."
9,5.0,"The Leeum Art Museum in Seoul is a manageable private art museum with three levels inside and an outside sculpture garden.  Audio phones in many languages allow one to have a private tour at ones own pace.  From ancient to modern art this private collection is informative, educational, entertaining, and thoroughly enjoyable.  I took two hours on a Sunday to leisurely tour the entire museum.  It cost about $9 USD. Plus $10 for the audio phone. Well worth the price."
10,4.0,"The museum itself is already a masterpiece you don't have to admire anything else. Entrance fee is at 10000 Korean won for both permanent exhibitions. The first exhibitions are all chinaware/bronze ware displays, calligraphy and Buddha statues. The second exhibitions are for modern / contemporary arts, which I love. There is also a little outdoor garden with a few pieces. Great to spend an hour or 2."
11,5.0,The details of this museum are very unique. Since it is the Samsung museum you get the options having a samsung audio guide which was a really interesting museum experience. over all the artifacts are very old and different from what I was used to in the states so I would most definitely recommend for people who are interested in design and architecture and art of facts of history as well. Also the installation and from Rem Koolhaas architecture of the building is worth to check out.
12,5.0,"This is a really fantastic museum and a bit of a hidden gem, some of the Korean's I was working with hadn't heard of it. The Museum is split into two sections, contemporary art from International and Korean artists and also Ancient art and lots of ceramics from the Ceylon period. All of it beautiful and interesting. It's curated really well, and the flow of the space is excellent. Other reviews have mentioned the interactive hands free headset. It's definitely worth getting it for the extra 1000W. It activates by itself when you move to a piece that you are interested in and gives a short but helpful amount of info. Very clever. A must visit if you are an art lover."
13,5.0,"I spent a couple hours exploring this wonderful museum in Hannam-dong, I took the subway to Hanganjin and it was a mere 15 minute walk away. The museum has an impressive collection of contemporary art from artists around the world and Korean artists in one area and in another area a historic collection of wares and paintings from a bygone era of Korean history. I was so excited to find an Alberto Giacometti that I set off the little alarm warning I was too close to the painting. After a week of battling with other tourists at tourist hot spots, this museum was a welcome relief to the weary mind. The cafe also made a fantastic coffee and served pretty good cake too. If you visit I recommend that you pay the 1000 won for the digital guide which works when you stand in front of an exhibit, giving you the low down of the artist and the thought process behind a piece of work."
14,5.0,Set in quiet location in a trendy neighbourhood the museum building designed by world renowned architects is fascinating. I liked most the museum 1 building both in terms of architecture as well as collection. The audio guide which works automatically when you approach a piece of the collection is a must. You start at the 4th floor and then walk down. The ceramics collection is outstanding. In museum 2 I liked Damien Hirst's work best. Definitely worth a visit!
15,3.0,"Small-ish collection, but some great pieces. Lovely building and well set out for easy self-guided tour.Even though it perhaps costs a little more on a strict collection size to price ratio than some other galleries and museums in Seoul, I don't think you can grumble over the ticket price given some of the world class art and artifacts on display."
16,2.0,"Leeum Museum has a beautiful collection, including Damien Hirst, Basquiat, Paik Nam June etc. However, the staff really made the entire experience unenjoyable. They hovered around, seemed very suspicious of the guests and monitored you wherever you went. The proximity sensors in front of many pieces were far too sensitive, and very loud and shrill. I was constantly disrupted by the alarms sounding by someone passing by a painting ""too closely"". The museum is also very harsh on its ""no photography"" policy (that resulted in the staff staring closely whenever you took out your phone) which I dislike but others may be fine with. I would still say go for the art, but try to ignore everything else that's going on."
17,2.0,"I truly enjoyed the exhibitions. My favourite was the Basquiat piece they had on display. I didn't care much about the staff, other than a few of them basically following me everywhere I went. It was as if the intention was to make me feel uncomfortable. I was there for the art, nothing else, however they might want to rethink their way of dealing with art-lovers from other parts of the world. It's a place where people appreciate human expression, in its purest artistic form, rather than be constantly reminded of human insecurity and fear of the other. I asked to write a comment about my experience and was given a sticky note, which I'm sure was thrown away soon after. Unfortunate"
18,5.0,"I always visit art museums when I'm visiting any foreign city. The Leeum Samsung Museum of Art is a must see for anyone who likes are, and beautiful modern museums. The museum has collections of modern and historical art; I only visited the modern wing because that's how I roll."
19,5.0,"Despite being in Seoul a few times already, this was the first time I made the track to Leeum. This is definitely one I regret not going to earlier.The museum is split into two permanent exhibitions: Beyond Time, which houses historical art, and Beyond Space, housing contemporary art. Beyond Time focuses quite a bit on traditional Korean pottery (showcasing some Buddhist and Confucian elements). Unless you have a tour, I’d highly recommend getting an audio guide to truly appreciate the story/technique behind the historical art. There are also special exhibitions from time to time (check their website).I highly recommend the docent tours. Our English docent tour was lead by by Soyean, who was friendly, extremely knowledgeable, and had a great command of English to be able to explain things/field questions well.Make sure to take a step outside and admire the building and the decks, which itself feels like a work of art. In the sculpture garden you’ll find works from Anish Kapoor, who sculpted the Bean in Chicago.Will definitely be brining friends around next time I’m in town and there’s a special exhibition.P.S. No pictures allowed."
20,5.0,"This a museum of modern art, so if you enjoy a more realistic style, this isn't for you.Took the subway and then walked about 10-15 minutes to get here. Hangangin station I believe, exit 10. Once you get outside follow the signs, turn right and head up a steeper road/hill. Museum is on the right hand side.Korean Museum so emphasis is on Korean pieces, two main galleries, one is international and one is Korean. A great deal of traditional Korean Pottery which is very nice. I rented the audio guide for 1000won, well worth it. It tends to work on automatic, as you near a piece it will start telling you about it, though sometimes, you may need to remind it where you are.Small place so, you'll need maybe two hours depending on your interest and speed. Nice way to spend part of an afternoon."
21,3.0,"This is my 3rd time here in 3 years, and probably lastThe 2 permanent exhibitions are always the  same and the temporary exhbibits are few and far in between. I enjoy the rothko, giocometti, hitst, warhol, de kooning et al, but they are always the same ones. I think they bought a new murakami, which is niceThe other thing i don't like is they don't let you take pictures. And they have a dozen staff on each floor to stop you"
22,5.0,"The Leeum is located near the Itaewon station. The streets of Itaewon are pretty quiet on the weekday morning I visited, and I appreciated the different vibe of the area in comparison to the other parts of Seoul. The museum itself is quite a sight to behold from the exterior, and the inside only gets better! The permanent exhibition features four levels. I started from the top floor which housed Korean ceramic artifacts and worked my way down, and the audio guide that came with the full admission price was well worth it. There is no descriptions written beside the artwork so that's where the audio guide comes in handy. The bottom two levels are dedicated to contemporary art, with the likes of Francis Bacon, Willem de Kooning, Anish Kapoor, etc. The spiral staircase connecting the levels centers around a stunning piece of installation art. There is another side of the building that features a special exhibition, and at the time of my visit, it featured the installations of Olafur Eliasson. Breathtaking and inspiring! I easily felt that the Leeum was one of the best highlights of my trip in Seoul."
23,4.0,I made the wrong turn when finding this place and notice the houses are modern in this area. This museum have modern and traditional arts display which you can appreciate both.
24,4.0,"I went to see the Olafur Eliason (please excuse my spelling if it's wrong) and it was interesting. I'm not a big modern art fan but I found some of the art to be very unique and peaked my interest. It's a well laid out museum that has various exhibitions to go with it's permanent exhibition of Korean pottery and Buddhist art. Since I'm not a big modern art fan, this will probably be a one-time visit but I enjoyed it much more than the Tate Modern in London."
25,5.0,"I very much enjoyed my visit to the Leeum Smasung Museum.  I went on a Wednesday just after lunch and found there to be few other visitors which was a nice change of pace from many over crowded attractions I have seen in Seoul.There were 3 options for tickets- the permanent collection (10,000 won), the special exhibition (8,000 won), or a "" day pass"" combination of both (14,000 won).  I chose to get the day pass, which also includes a free audio guide(otherwise rental costs 2,000 won for permanent collection or 1,000 won for special).  The audio guide automatically picks up your location and tells you about the art you are in front of so there is no set order and it is very easy to use.  I would not have had as good of an experience without it.The permanent collection consists of 2 Museums (labeled 1 and 2).  Museum 1 has traditional art- pottery, calligraphy paintings and buddhist metal works. Having not been familiar with traditional works of this area, I found the audio guide to be very informative about the special features of each piece so I could better appreciate them.  I probably spent the most time in this gallery simply because I listed to the guide for almost every piece.Museum 2 has modern and contemporary art.  The collection is not extensive but they have a very interesting variety of works.  I particularly enjoyed seeing the Andy Warhol floral painting in person, the texture and contrast between the gloss in the black paint and the matte of the other colors can only truly be appreciated in person.For me, the highlight was the special exhibit, which is Olafur Eliasson's ""The Parliament of Possibilities"" which continues until the end of February 2017.  There are 22 pieces, many of which interact with the viewer through mirrors and light. The booklet reads ""The parliament of possibilities is the perfect occasion to explore the dynamic relationship between art and life""Other information included in the booklet that may be useful- parking is highly limited and public transportation is recommended. Usual admission is 10:30-6pm and is Closed on Mondays (as are many things in Seoul). The museum also includes a cafe and gift shop as well as a coat check, nursing room, and free wheelchair rentals.Overall I had a very pleasant afternoon here.  If you can appreciate the variety of art- from traditional pottery to recent modern works, there is plenty to see.  If you are coming only for one specific thing you may find it not worth your time.  I spent just over two hours here but could have easily spent 3 if I looked at and listened to the guide for every item."
26,4.0,"This museum is worth a visit if you're interested in Korean or Asian art. Went here to see the architecture and was amazed by the exhibit on Olafur Eliasson. If you're in Seoul and you love art, the exhibit is a must-see."
27,5.0,"In the heart of Itaewon, nice exhibits of artifacts and of modern works. 7,000W gets you in to all three halls, and it includes the audio guide."
28,5.0,"Am so glad I decided to drop by this museum.  Currently having they are having special exhibition - olafur eliasson ""parliament of possibilities"" which is definitely a big plus for me."
29,5.0,"Agree with the reviews. A must see museum. The contemporary stuff was more interesting to me but overall it's all worth seeing. There were so many moments I turned a corner and said ""wow"" in surprise at what I was seeing. Buildings and outdoors sculptures just add to the quality."
30,5.0,"As one guidebook said, if you only visit one museum in Seoul, Leeum is the one.  The buildings housing the museum, inside and out, are worth the trip alone and it is beautifully laid out.  Pay a few Won more for the day pass which gives you the interactive guide (a must!) and access to the whole building.The exhibits are excellent and varied enough to be of interest to a wide range of people.It's not well signposted from the station though.  Come out of exit 1 at Hangangjin (line 6) and walk straight ahead for about 500 metres.  It's then signposted to the right."
31,5.0,"Museum split into 2 parts. Museum 1 displays classic pieces from mostly 500-1000 years ago giving insight into not only Korean, but also a bit of Chinese art of that time. Educational (art-wise). Tye second part, Museum 2, displays 20-century art from Korea but also international artists in a way that connects them in a meaningful manner. The museum building itself with its exterior is quite cool too! Samsung made interactive displays that allow you to see a few 3D objects displayed in the museum from all angles (by means of virtual rotation etc.). I was not that amazed by that part, but looks cool. At least for those 2 vases it's meant for 😃"
32,5.0,"Ok so I've found my galley nirvana, this place is so very good. Curators need congratulating for superb exhibitions. Putting Rothko next to Buddha is inspired genius. Good mix of art, eras, special exhibition. Architecture wonderful"
33,2.0,"The Leeum Samsung Museum of Art is located about 10 minutes away from the Hangangjin Station on line 6 of the Seoul Subway.  I found the outside of the museum to be well designed.  On the inside, the art work displayed may not have been my type of art because I was mostly underwhelmed, especially since the admission fee is 10,000 won ($10 USD).  It also didn't help that I found the staff on duty to be mostly cold and unfriendly.  I went near closing time so they may have been dying to get off of work but that shouldn't be an excuse.  I found that the War Memorial of Korea and the National Folk Museum of Korea to be better and the admission is free."
34,5.0,"Undoubtedly, it's the best museum I've visited in Seoul. The three buildings are amazing gems built by renowned contemporary architects: Mario Botta (Swiss), Jean Nouvel (French) and Rem Koolhaas (Dutch). The displayed collection mixes Occidental and Asian contemporary art with wit, intelligence, with a rare sense of elegance. That's a must!"
35,5.0,"The place has a great expensive collection of art and it is very affordable for the quality of time and money they put in the space. Where else will you see mario botta, jean nouvel and rem koolhaas buildings in the same place? I mean I wasn't in love but I really appreciated the large sculptures and their vast collection of korean art and international art."
36,5.0,"This was the highlight of my Seoul stay. The curators did a fantastic job, and I would love to go back again to see what shows they put on next in their non-permanent wing. Take the time to get an audio guide for your tour. The museum staff designed them very well--the interface is extremely user friendly, informative, and helpful. Budget at least 2 hours, but if you love art/architecture/history you can spend 4 without issue. The museum is located near many excellent restaurants, so you can make a day outing of it, and even puncture your visit with some extended shopping/browsing nearby to avoid museum fatigue :)"
37,5.0,Decided to strike out on my own for this one.  Family was involved in other things.Itaewon is a popular area with many things for people to do.  There are several hidden gems here!  The historical exhibition on Korean pottery was amazing! Some of the shapes i have never even seen.  And the colors!! I also appreciated the way they positioned more modern pieces among the antiques. There was an exhibit of royal pieces. This gives a slight glimpse of the opulence of some of the dynasty royal's lives.The 2nd area was completely modern.
38,4.0,"I could see this museum from my hotel in Itaewan and was determined to find it.  Located a short walk from Hangangjin subway (Line 4 - Exit 1) walk about 50m turn right and head up the hill.Before you enter down the pathway, turn right at the entrance and enjoy the outdoor space.  There are views, sculptures and a great view of the 3 buildings designed by 3 different architects.On entry into the museum, you are overwhelmed by space and the clever use of natural light.  Visiting in Autumn allows the stunning autumn leaves to dominate and every window frames a perfect photo.  I have never seen so many staff at a museum, it felt a little overdone but clearly the art on display is important and showcases Korean traditional art and Korean and international modern and contemporary art.Take the time to visit both Museum 1 and 2, the staff direct you to the top floors by lift and then there are arrows to guide you around each floor and down the staircases in each museum, each a work of art in itself.What I enjoyed about this museum was the space, it was not overcrowded and the art on display was impeccably staged. It took me 1-2 hours to see everything and I did not do the audio tour but I would suggest if you have time to sit in the foyer area and watch the digital display or have a coffee in the cafe.  It's a very cool space and one of the most beautiful museum's I have visited."
39,4.0,"A rare unique collection of porcelain artifacts ,  Buddhist paintings and structures spread over 2 museums"
40,5.0,"Not as large as the Lourve or the MoMA, Leeum is equally astounding in terms of aesthetics and appreciation of ancient heritage. Tucked inside a quiet hill side of bustling Itaewon, she is perched on a little hill waiting to welcome art lovers and history buff alike. I went to the ancient Korean Art exhibit where Celadon and Porcelain art work were the main art pieces. Korean art is filled with splendor, resplendent and utterly mesmerizing for our eyes to behold. Worth a visit."
41,4.0,"Tucked away in Itaewon, I got a little lost finding it so arrived with only around an hour to visit.  I would recommend giving yourself a few hours to spend with the two collections (the traditional art and contemporary), I wish I hadn't had to rush through."
42,4.0,"My 2nd time here and this time I spent more time and also ventured into the traditional galleryMuseum/gallery 1 is traditional , with all the porcelain , gold and other ancient artifacts. Quite interestingly , they intersperse some modern pieces that were inspired by ancient art. So you see a Giacometti or something else next to a ancient vaseGallery 2 is the contemporary one, which I prefer. They have all the famous names - twonbly, hirst, bacon, kooning, Zhang Fangyi, Warhol et alI think the downside to this museum is that they don't have temporary or rotating art, so you see the same pieces on your repeat visit"
43,5.0,"This is a favorite spot for any artist.  It's easy to spend 3 hours here.  The work is very up to the minute and the displays are expertly done to give the maximum effect for the work and the artist's intent.  There is audio if you like to be lectured to or you can forgo that.  The price for the shows are standard, similar to what you would pay in America or London."
44,2.0,"One of the smallest collection ever that need to pay 10K W. 3Floors of ancient and modern art display.walking uphill was a huge effort. Go to other Museum or Palaces...if you like architecture, go around backlane of itaewon you can see more interesting cafes and boutiques design."
45,5.0,well I was so lucky because there was a exhibition of jean michel basquiat...wich I loved..the museum is located at itaweon neighborhood so you can have a chance to do both...it worth a visit !
46,5.0,The way the museum shows traditional Korean art in one wing and modern Korean and World art in the other wing provides a great contrast.
47,5.0,"I really enjoyed my time here!Going to art museums is my second favorite thing to do when I travel and this is probably one of the best museums I've been to in a while.First the architecture is so beautiful and each section of the museum has it's own vibe that compliments the artwork that is on display. Second the entrance fee is completely reasonable and even includes a free audio guide (English available) with these high tech Samsung phones that automatically go off when you're in front of the art piece. The guide also has additional videos or photo books to look at the piece from a different view (like the back of it if you can't see it, or multiple pages of a book in a display case) This was REALLY helpful and I really enjoyed it.Third it has a wonderful mix of old and new. The first gallery is all older works, mostly ceramics, the second gallery is all modern works including some bigger names. I was really surprised to see three Giacometti pieces which was wonderful! The third gallery is the special events currently it's: Shooting the Elephant- this was my least favorite part of the museum- I wasn't a fan but the space itself was really cool! I hope to go back and visit when a different special exhibit is going through. Overall I had a great time and would recommend this art museum to everyone!"
48,5.0,"This is the best art gallery I have ever visited for a number of reasons:- The architecture of the building is as impressive as the artworks inside. - The collection in the second gallery are particularly thought provoking and by some extremely famous artists (e.g Gilbert and George) - I discovered a sculpture by Korean artist Do Ho Suh... One of my now favourite artists - The audio guide is ultra modern, like a Samsung phone, which is triggered automatically when you stand in front of each exhibit but you can also view close up images of the exhibits on the device."
49,4.0,That was a direct quote from Agnes Martin. And it was the room with her paintings that moved me the most. Yes there are a couple Rothko's here. And the national treasures are impressive. But go see Agnes. Feel the blue.
50,5.0,"An impressive museum with both old and new art. Museum building itself is a work of art. There are some longer-term displays and changing displays. At one part of the museum some Korean old pottery was beautifully displayed, at another there were modern paintings and installations (Hirst, Rothko, Naim June Paik and such). Also the changing display was very interesting and thought provoking. Museum has good, and of course beautifully designed, cafe."
51,5.0,"If you're into modern art and/or architecture _at all_ then this is worth a visit. The building itself is stunning, and the thematic flow of the exhibits is great. The collection isn't obscenely massive, but it's of very high quality, displaying prime examples of both Korean/Eastern and Western modern art. Get the little Samsung devices that use NFC to display info about the various works of art when you're near them."
52,3.0,"I anticipated more from this museum, based on its name; my mistake. The architecture was interesting, as were the exhibits, but: (1) photography was not permitted, although the items were in general not necessarily light sensitive, and (2) the National Museum, as it turns out, had more and better examples of many of the items on display."
53,5.0,"A MUST visit if you are into modern art and good architecture. I spent 3 hours there and could have seen more, but got tired :-)Tips: - Get the cheap audio guide - makes you put your eyes on the right things- Avoid the museum cafe and shop: even as everything looks nice, the prices are just far beyond sensible prices elsewhere in Seoul"
54,5.0,I liked in particular the display of old china. It was exquisite. The best thing about this museum is the phone guide. You just stand in front of the item you would like to be explained and the voice recording goes automatically without you needing to push any buttons. Lovely!
55,5.0,Very nice place to visit especially if you love art ! Many artists and very cool building ! Worth a visit !!
56,4.0,"Located in the middle of a residential district, I took a cab here. I headed straight to the contemporary section with the electronic guide (samsung phone and headphone of course)There's Andy Warhol, Damien hirst, Ai Weiwei etc, so pretty interesting There's an outdoor section as well with sculptures but it was a hot summer day so one can't stay long Didn't go to the traditional sectionHad to wait by the entrance for a cab and thankfully it wasn't too long as some people would drop off"
57,5.0,"I loved this museum.  Unlike most of the other major museums in Seoul you have to pay for entrance: 10,000 KRW.  But I consider it well worth the cost.  The museum is in two parts:1.  Antique pieces (pottery, paintings etc.)  The collection is quite small but well curated which I prefer to a huge amount of random pieces.  There were pieces of modern art interspaced, in some cased to complement the antiques and in other cases directly inspired by them.  I thought this was a really nice touch.2.  Modern art.  Its mostly Korean but with some foreign pieces present as well.  The galleries are by theme rather than country of origin allowing you to compare and contrast how Korean and western artists reacted to new artitistic trends.For an extra 1,000 KRW you can get an electonic guide: a small tablet and headphones which automatically comes to life as you approach each exhibit.  It's really great and well worth the small extra costs.  All together, this museum is just first class, nice exhibits well created with a nice guide in English providing you with as much or little information as you want for each piece.  A must-visit in Seoul."
58,5.0,I tried to visit today and was sadly disappointed. When I arrived the sign said it will be closed for a few weeks to prepare for an anniversary. Not sure the dates of closure. I rated it excellent because of all the reviews.
59,5.0,"Half of this museum is devoted to traditional historical objects, ceramics and jewelry. It's similar to what you see at the National Museum of Korea, but a smaller and better-curated selection. Elegant stuff. The other half is contemporary art. What's neat about that half is that, in addition to Western artists you usually see at high-end museums, you see some really edgy contemporary Korean artists. Very creative and unusual. The museum is not huge. I arrived 1 hour before closing and managed to see most of it while only feeling a little rushed. It's a little hard to find up in a residential neighborhood in the hills. You may want to have a hand-held GPS with you. But it's only a 10-minute walk up from Itaewon, where you can find many Western-style restaurants if you need a break from kimchi. Admission in April of 2014 was around $10."
60,5.0,"An easy walk from the subway station, The Leeum Museum is a must visit for art lovers who are into contemporary art. The place is easy to explore and the collection well laid out. A good place to while away your time if you have extra time in Seoul."
61,3.0,"almost all the museums in seoul are free, bigger and betterthis one costed me something like 10usd... if you have just a few days in seoul go to the war museum and national museum, they are better... but still if u like art, this is ur place... also photos are not allowed inside... :("
62,5.0,"Went to many museums during my stay in Seoul. This was my favorite. Great collection. Great audio guide. No pictures though. Pay the 12,000 for the day pass, definitely worth it."
63,4.0,"I made this my first stop in Seoul, I was really looking forward to visiting it! Its architecture drew me there and left almost pleased, the Samsung Child Education & Culture Center was closed to visitors, such a letdown! Museum 1 was boring to me, but went in anyway to check out the rotunda. Museum 2 was enjoyable but just showing its permanent collection, which was ok but didn't make it up for the disenchantment of being unable to check out the inside of Koolhaas building. I guess it was probably bad timing, but definitely worth going and have a look around this interesting ensemble!"
64,5.0,"An international level museum. World known artists and impressive displays in a unique building. Don't miss the outdoor sculptures of Anish Kapoor and Calder and Takashi Murakami's installation in the lobby hall. Luckily there was a Calder exhibition, but the permanent collection is also beautiful and interesting! Easy to reach by the brown metro line to Itawon"
65,4.0,"Leeum had a rather memorable collection of celadon, bronze and other national treasures viewed last year which encouraged a return during a recent trip to Seoul. In addition, I had the chance to see their current special exhibit on Calder which was worth visiting on its own.Individual entrance fees are KRW10000 (~USD10) for the permanent exhibition and KRW8000 (~USD8) for the special exhibit, but there is a reduced day pass of KRW14000 (~USD14) to visit both. The digital guide costs an extra KRW2000 (~USD2) and while it enhanced the viewing experience in this modern private museum, did not think visits would be hindered if you don't rent one.The digital guide operates on a sensor and automatically plays when you come close to objets d'art, while containing additional information to read. Its use can significantly increase the time spent in Leeum, especially because of the long physical descriptions of what is evident in the item. I did like the explanations on why an object is rare, or how it was made.The permanent exhibit remains impressive on this second visit.  The collection offers a small (but not insignificant) number of high quality, well-preserved, beautiful historical items and art works which are displayed for individual appreciation. The highlight of this visit would be the special exhibit on Calder, the father of mobiles. This is a comprehensive exhibit featuring Calder's beginnings, from his charming wire sculptures, to jewelry, to visually striking paintings, and of course to his mobiles, which were many sorts: large and small, while some were on the ground and others hung from the ceiling. This was indeed well-done and much enjoyed, and the visit was hindered only by a big group that had a loud-speaking guide. Anyway the Calder exhibit felt worthy of the entrance fee and I wouldn't mind coming back to see this again. Unfortunately the exhibit ends on 20 October 2013.There is no photography allowed in the permanent exhibit but the Leeum brochures contain a good amount of photos which serve as substitute.The outside area was being renovated last year and Bourgeois' spider is now gone (although it remains on a few Tourism brochures). This area, which is open to the public, now features a towering installation of chrome balls. There is also a large mobile installation behind it.Once again, this was a very good visit to the Leeum, covering the exhibition rooms for around 3 hours. For those who have been to the Leeum before and find themselves in Seoul again, it's worth checking back to see if the special exhibit would be of interest, as this recent one on Calder was well put together and very much enjoyed."
66,4.0,"A museum where the space is a masterpiece on its own.There are few art pieces, modern and  antiques, displayed with a lot of  care. it worth the visit."
67,5.0,"Yeah, this museum is not well spoken around, but I liked it a lot!You should rent the audio tour, and then you will learn a lot about korean ceramics, painting and other traditional arts.They also have a ""modern art exposition"", which features some contemporary art!My recommendation is to come here and then have some lunch at Itaewon, since it is walking distance! On your way to Itaewon  there is some small cool shops!"
68,5.0,"A really fantastic introduction to Korean art. Such a classy museum! Exhibits are introduced by a friendly voice on the rented (Samsung!) device, and this adds to the experience."
69,4.0,"I only had a couple days in Seoul, so had to pack in my sightseeing carefully; this art museum was easy to fit in just a couple hours due to it's small size and had an appealing permanent exhibition. It seemed carefully curated and provided a nice taste of both traditional and modern/contemporary Korean art. There was some international modern art as well, with samples of work from easily recognizable Asian and Western artists. Besides the collection, the building itself was also beautiful and you could tell a lot of thought was put into the entrance to and movement though the building. While I love art and always want to see a lot of it when I travel, I'd also recommend this place for those who aren't huge museum fans but just want a taste. Not only is it easy to digest, but it was easy to get to; a short enough walk from the subway station, which was lined with a great variety of restaurants, cafes and boutiques. All in all, this was a very pleasant way to spend part of the afternoon."
70,4.0,We only had a short time to explore the museum which the Grand Hyatt overlooks. The description system on samsung phones is really good and very comprehensive. It was a fascinating place and definitely worth visiting.
71,4.0,"This is an interesting museum, with both traditional Korean art and some very modern stuff. The building that houses the various collections is gorgeous. Do take the audio guide, which is quite high tech and fairly interesting, unless you have less than one hour to visit, in which case you wouldn't be able to listen to all the explanations."
72,5.0,"Great but standard contemporary art, still one of the most interesting in SeoulSponsored,or owned, by the Samsung family"
73,4.0,"Leeum Samsung Museum is worth a visit.  The museum is down the hill from the Itaewon subway station (actually a bit closer to the one after Itaewon that began with an ""h""), which allows you to fill an afternoon with both the museum and shops/food in Itaewon.  The museum is a lot smaller than many others, but that makes it manageable.  I made it through the two permanent exhibits and the visiting exhibit in an hour and a half.  The self-guided tour is well worth the 2,000 Won.  They give you a Samsung smart phone that tells you about each piece when you step in front of it.  Cool building architectually, too."
74,4.0,"I really enjoyed my visit to this ultra modern gallery. The architecture is attractive and welcoming.  The space is open and allows easy flow of traffic without interfering with others viewing.  Lovely feel to it. Small enough to view in a lazy morning or early afternoon... Two hours is plenty. Brilliant outdoor installations on a decking suitable for taking the sun if the day permits! I loved this place, which is surprisingly easy to access from Itaewon Main Street."
75,5.0,"They had three architects - OMA, Mario Botta, and Jean Nouvel - to create this museum. It's interesting to see how these distinctively different styles come together. If you are into architecture, it's worth going. They also have good collection of art. I went to see Anish Kapoor exhibition last November. The place is also quite spacious, enough to handle big scale art work like Kapoor's."
76,4.0,"I am no fan of museums but this museum has interesting pieces that made me want to start going to more museums. Even if pictures are not allowed or that I forgot to bring a notebook or my phone to take note which ones are interesting, some pieces are remarkable that I was able to remember. They advise you to start from traditional museum (Museum 1), from the highest floor down. Quick tip though that if you have limited time, get to choose which collection you would be more interested in - traditional or modern. I personally noticed too that the more interesting pieces tend to be on the lower floors, i.e. contemporary art in the Modern Collection.It is a quick and easy walk from Hangangjin Station. Signposts are there to guide you to the museum. I've written a more detailed review of the museum in www.iamnotravelplanner.com."
77,4.0,"It was a really interesting place to visit. It was neat to see the giant spiders in the middle of the city. Most of the art is contemporary, but there is an upstairs section devoted to the family's collection of antique celadon pottery. Mostly the placement of the art was good, however especially in the antique pottery section, the lighting was too dim to really be able to appreciate what was in front of you. Still, it was a great place to visit and the artwork was delightful!"
78,5.0,Comprehensive display of Korean Art including some National Treasures.  Also a good collection of 20th century Western painting.
79,4.0,"Recently visited the Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art and had a pleasant viewing here. Entrance fee is pricey (KRW10,000, ~USD9) considering the fraction of art available in this museum and compared with the free entrance and much more extensive collection in the National Museum of Korea (NMK). However, personally found the traditional art pieces in Leeum to be worth viewing. It might be because of the presentation, but thought Leeum had more exquisite celadon than the NMK's special exhibit which was viewed later that day.The lay out of Leeum is quite good. Each floor houses enough art pieces which are well-displayed for individual appreciation. In Museum 1, captions also indicate the time period, allowing one to be somehow acquainted with the Korean dynasties and the prevailing ceramic art of the era. The well-preserved ceramics from Goryeo period were very nice. Equally enjoyed was the metal/bronze floor, displaying elaborate art pieces, also well-preserved, dating back to the 5th/6th century. The modern and contemporary Korean and international artworks in Museum 2 were also interesting; though not a big fan of this period, found the ones in Leeum to be accessible and ""amusing."" Was quite entertained with Kim Sooja's Needle Woman, and intrigued by Jeff Koons Smooth Egg with Bow.  However  at the time of visit, Louis Bourgeois's renowned spider art in the complex grounds had already been removed, and the outside public zone art works were not yet ready for viewing. This was the only disappointment had here.To get to Leeum by metro, take exit #1 in Hangangjin Station. Lots of signs along the way leading to Leeum. Note they are closed on Mondays and some holidays. In sum, Leeum packs the punch when it comes to quality art. Particularly for the traditional Korean ceramics and bronze/metal, it probably doesn't get any better than here. For museumgoers, this makes a worthwhile visit when traveling to Seoul."
