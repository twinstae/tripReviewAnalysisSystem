0,5.0,University and working life canâ€™t be the same for sure. The campus has best scenery on fall when the leaves turn into a colorful scenery.
1,4.0,"I'm currently studying in Korea University for the summer (June-August), and I'm enjoying my time here very much. Buildings are not only well constructed, they are also rather amazing and grand. Couples can take nice photos (even wedding photos!) in front of Inchon Memorial Hall. Amenities in school include Hana Bank (local Korean bank), many different cafes (E.g. Aricafe), and convenience stalls. There is also a health center located in school, with medical amenities."
2,4.0,Situated on its own hill. Korea University runs its own shuttle service into campus. I took a taxi there.  I also found out this university is serviced by airport bus. Good to explore the grounds of one famous university in Seoul.
3,5.0,"Instead of korean building, here we can see a lot of western architecture. You can easily access this place as it is near to station"
4,5.0,"Most of tourists from HK go to hongik or ewha women's university actually for shopping, but Korea university is total different. It's a true quite campus with beautiful trees, grass & building, you could soak in such academic environment, feel like back to campus & experience golden time again. I go in may, for sure it will be much more beautiful in fall with red leaves everywhere"
