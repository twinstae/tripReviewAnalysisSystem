0,5.0,"The Cathedral for the diocese of South Korea is one of the must-sees in Seoul.  Nestled downtown by the famous Myeong-dong market, several Masses are held on Sunday and all are filled with devout Catholics who seem to fill the air with spiritual warmth."
1,4.0,"As everything was nearly destroyed during the Korean War, and efforts to remove traces of Japan's colonial rule of Korea, there are only a few western-style historic buildings left. This is one of them. Visit here while you are at Myeongdong, a popular shopping district."

7,4.0,The Cathedral is worth a visit even if it was for a change of atmosphere in a buzzing city. It is a strange sight in the usually buzzing city. An oasis of rest and quiteness with even a Lourdes like prayer cavern. It si atrange to see a usually tall building almost seemingto drown in the moderness of tall skysrapers.
8,5.0,"The cathredal is located on a hill in the Myeong-dong shopping district. The shopping district with it's (mostly well known) shops, coffee chain shops, restaurants and massage parlors is like any other district of this kind. The cathedral is the real USP and makes the place worth going there."
9,3.0,"Myeondong is commercialized and packed so seeing the Cathedral to my left was a bit of a surprised since I didn't expect it there. Surrounded by a nice garden, it is a pretty red cathedral."
