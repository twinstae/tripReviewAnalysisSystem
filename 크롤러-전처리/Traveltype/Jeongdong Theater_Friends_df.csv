0,5.0,"I saw ""The Palace"" show with my friends. The show is a story about a king and his concubine. It's easy to understand because there aren't a lot if dialogue and they have subtitle in English, Chinese, and Japanese for foreigners."
1,5.0,"Very nice experience, I would suggest to everyone visiting Seoul to book a ticket for performance in this theater. It was nicely done, good artistic performances and fun, all in one. We have got the cheapest tickets, but the view was still very good."
2,5.0,"What an amazing experience... we watched a theatrical performance play "" Lotus - a flower comes out once more"". The story is told with beautiful and splendid music and dances. The performers and their outfits were superb. Not to miss if you're in Seoul."
3,5.0,"I attended a performance of  ""Lotus"" last night. It was excellent. The performers are obviously highly trained professionals and the production values were very high as the costumes, lighting and set were really good. The sorcerer's dance and the Queen's struggling with jealousy were amazing. The cast were not only wonderful dancers but excellent drummers and actors."
4,5.0,"I just watched ""Lotus"" last night. It was so good that my friend and I was really satisfied. The dancer/actors are professionals. The witch's dance with power , beauty, and mystery impressed me most."
5,5.0,"It was in the evening of our second day in Seoul that went to this theater. The way it was performed was fantastic , the stage and the lightings left no questions . It is about the ancient stories and myths and they have all been given life and brought to life by the professional performers who are wearing traditional costumes . There is no talking in the performance. The stage is being changed regularly based on the subject of each episode . Each performance takes almost one hour . At the end of the performance, back to the waiting hall , the performers are present for taking pictures."
6,5.0,Last  night  was  my  second  time  at this  show .  I saw  the  performance  10 years  ago  when  the  now director was the star of  the  show .  Great  dancing  with  music . The  finale is rousing  and I  defy any  body  to not  feel  the drums  during  the  ending . Don't  even  try  to  make  or take  a picture  or phone  call  when  the  play starts. The ushers are right   there  to politely  remind  you . After  the  show  there   is  a  meet  and  greet  for  photos . I  recommend  this  as a  must  see .
7,5.0,"Last May 2014, I was able to watch a popular traditional Korean play at Jeongdong Theater called Miso. Miso, a Korean word that means “beautiful smile” or “magandand ngiti” in Filipino. Miso is the No. 1 Korean Traditional Arts Performance loved by people from all over the world. Starting last April 2014, Jeongdong Theater presents its new performance for 2014 which is Miso: Baebijang-jeon. It is my first time to watch Miso and for me the performance is very interesting and funny at the same time. I did not have dull moments while watching the show which makes it MUST-SEE performance when you go to Seoul. Baebijang-jeon is not just an ordinary play as the story is told through traditional Korean dance, Samulnuri (traditional percussion quartet) and other Korean traditional instruments as well. The combination of the traditional dance and music will definitely capture the attention of all the audience not only Koreans but also foreigners like me as well who loves musical performances. For me it is like watching my favorite sageuk drama live and up-close since we had a good seats in the theater. The whole production is perfect from the background, to the music, the cast (all of them are handsome and pretty!!!), and the colorful and vibrant costumes used in the play. If I want to I can watch the play over and over again and you don’t need advanced level of Korean to understand it because they provide English, Chinese, and Japanese translations on screen. Lastly, one thing I like in Jeongdong Theater is that the size of the theater is not so big and not so small either just the perfect size for you to watch the play and you can see the cast really close without using any binoculars. After the show, you can take pictures together with the cast as souvenir for free.Performances are held twice a day (Closed on Mondays): one in the afternoon 16:00 and at night 20:00. The tickets for this musical range from ₩ 40,000 to ₩ 50,000. If you come early you can visit the nearby places like Jungmyeongjeon Hall, Jeongdong First Methodist Church, and Seoul Museum of Art before watching the show. To get to the theater you can either got to Seodaemun Station (Seoul Subway Line 5), Exit 5 or You can also go out from City Hall Station (Seoul Subway Line 1, 2), Exit 12 and just follow the stonewall road along Deoksugung Palace. #wowkoreasupporters"
8,4.0,"The Chongdong Theater is a cozy small theater. You probably have a good view on the stage from nearly every seat. However I wouldn't go for the front rows as you really have to look up the entire time. We were on the fifth row in the middle which was just excellent. The musical starts with the entire story (written) shown on a screen. Throughout the rest of the musical there will not be spoken so to know the story line beforehand is helpful. There's no language barrier or a problem with comprehension as the actors are just brilliant. Their expressions, together with the beautiful music played live on Korean traditional instruments, helps you understand everything perfectly. The show is not too long, 80 minutes without intermission which is just right. There are some interactive and funny parts which makes it all very entertaining. Having said that there are some intense parts which would make me advise against taking too young children."
9,5.0,The Chongdong Theater provides a wonderful cultural experience (although a bit on the loud side).  I enjoyed being able to see and hear the traditional musical instruments and dances.
