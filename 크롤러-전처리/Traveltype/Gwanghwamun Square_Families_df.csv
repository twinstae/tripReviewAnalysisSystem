0,4.0,"We were walking through the square, saw the massive statues of King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sunshin, so we decided to stop in.  I found this museum very engaging for being devoted to only two historical figures. Turns out the King Sejong created the Korean language and was an early model for the value of scholarship.  Admiral Yi's story is simply amazing and the exhibits in that portion of the museum are fantastic.We intended to just have a quick look and ended up staying for two hours.  We were pleasantly surprised.Also, the museum provides (for a charge) activities for kids.  We loved making the wood cut prints - my kids still have theirs!If you have some time, stop in and see what this museum has to offer!"

But the 2nd time, I walked here, I realized that there's actually a mini museum underground with the entrance somewhere near the statue. How did I even missed that during the first visit?

Very lively procession with lot of music, characters of dragon, cartoons, creatures. Good for all ages"
47,4.0,"This area is opposite of Gyeongbuk palace and you drop by before or after your visit to the palace. I would say taking picture of the Gwanghwamun gate from the square is recommended as you can capture the whole gate. The square itself is not huge but you have statues of King Sejong and the scientific inventions from his era as well as Admiral Yi Sun Shin on the other end of the square. Under King Sejong's statue, there is a small area which you can enter to learn more about him. There are also flowers in the middle which looks beautiful especially during the spring. On certain days, there are flea markets, concerts and other entertainments around the area. There is also a small booth for foreigners to try to put hanbok (traditional Korean attire) near the exit to enter the subway station (which is right behind Admiral Yi Sun Shin). You can park somewhere around the area or using the palace's parking area and drop by the square for a walk."

51,4.0,"This is a great square, and it has the two most famous statues -- King Sejong the Great (inventor of the Hangul alphabet undergirding the high literacy of Koreans) and admiral Yi Sun-shin (commander of Joseon Navy which destroyed the Japanese fleet supporting the Hideyoshi invasion of Korea).  Very often there are events in the square and a fountain complex in the southern part that is really fun for kids in the summer.  It is often the site of political demonstrations, too, but these are very tame for the most part.The more interesting part of the square are what is around and what is below.  What is around include Gyeongbuk Palace (with its displays and its guard changing), the Sejong Cultural Center which has performance events, and good restaurants on the Sejong Cultural Center side.  On the U.S. Embassy side is the Museum of Contemporary History which is new and okay.  Below the square are two fun museums devoted to Admiral Yi and King Sejong respectively.  The Yi museum has a walk-in replica of the famous turtle boat, and there are lots of things for kids to see and do.  The King Sejong side is very educational and informative and has some displays on the many design achievements that make use of Hangul."
