59,4.0,"During the visit to Seoul of Korea, I also go to visit a famous area---Hongik, which is a commercial place for people to go shopping. I suppose that it is really a great place to know more about fashion. As we all know, the K-pop music of Korea is quite popular all over the world, especially among the youngers. I enjoy the Korean music a lot, it is with the strong beat as well as the wonderful music. There are some teenager that are keen on the K-pop music and dancing. They perform in the street by themselves, this type of situation also attracts many passer-by’s attention. You will have a enjoyment of sighting and listening. What’s more, there are also other Korean style food to have a try. I think that the tourists can make a schedule to plan the routine to Hongik. Hope you guys enjoy yourself!"

62,5.0,"Another happening place at Hongdae is the Children's Park. On Saturday nights, the lights and the crowd of college students make the place come alive. Young performers sing, dance or rap...each group having their own styles, and attracting fans from the crowd. When we were there, we were amazed at the talent and versatility of a boy band group who wowed the audience with their rapping skills.  They had a good rapport with the audience and soon participation was  encouraged. Some were dancing with the beat,  but is was a wonderful surprise to see a foreign student who moved from among the crowd to the makeshift stage and rapped her heart away. She definitely stole the hearts of the audience and the performers. If you are fond of music and unconventional ways of the Korean youth express their passions, go and experience what we did.  Best part? It's free."
63,5.0,as in many street markets in seoul you should not miss this one. lots of independent craft stalls on weekend. on weekdays you can mingle with the locals and not so much on tourists because this area is for the hip and young crowd as this is an university area.

So the question is, why go if you are not one of them, or to party?The answer is simple: it is the future of the country. Literally, as the youth will Be the next generation of leaders in business, politics, and drivers of direction of the country. But really, what I mean is this is where you can experience the culture of the NOW of South Korea. Forward looking, in style, thought, desire... the movement of the new, now.Is it the South Korea you expect, festooned with hundreds of years of Confucianism morals and ethics... or a process shaped by generations of religious and old world cultural beliefs? Well, yes, yes it is. Just not in the way you might imagine. To understand, you must see. To see, you must be openminded. To be openminded, you must go without preconception. Leave judgment at the door, thank you.So, go. Go you must, if you want to understand South Korea. Make sense? Who? How? Go, and know. There, now you understand. If you don't, pass. If you get it, go.

114,5.0,"Fun, interesting, gorgeous people and great restaurants.  Easy to hang out here jumping from coffee shop to barbecue restaurant to boutique to bar."
115,5.0,This place is full of Yongsters and alot of clothings and also few nice things for you guys to shop. and Hongdae areas is full of bar and club and ask for a map and ask the hotel staffs to help you guys out
116,3.0,"Lots of shopping, many youngsters too. There's a great fried chicken and beer restaurant. Forgotten the name but you  can ask the tourist centre for directions."
117,5.0,"A little crowded over the weekend, occasional cars that venture in to make the stroll more agonizing! Fashion and items are generic and repetitive. But lots of choices for food. Plenty of trendy folks around too. But much prefer Konkuk University street."
118,4.0,"we visiting Hongik at Saturday night and that is a great time to seen the Korean teen life, many apparel brand shop and also street dance performance. feel you see the K-pop show, LOL. must visit and must seen if you're in Seoul. Recommend for Library Cafe near the exit subway."
119,5.0,"This whole area is very happening and bustling. Compared to myeongdong, this is where you will find the local youngsters. I always get lost as there are lots of little streets and alleys. The restaurants here are very cheap and there are countless cafes. You can easily spend a few hours. In my opinion the weekend ""Free market"" is so overrated. Although its nice to support students and their handcrafts, their selling prices are so high it's hard to purchase anything. Also we lined up for over 1 hour to get our portraits drawn."
120,4.0,"This is a place to visit in the evening. There will be lots of people; average age is probably in the low 20's, and lots of eateries. It's fun just to walk around and listen to the street musicians, have a bite to eat and a cocktail in a plastic bag."
121,4.0,"This place is more or less like myeongdong but this place is more hip and chic with coffee shops, cafes,  street foods and also cosmetic shops. With additional of busking street.. Since arex is direct to hongik university station. I prefer to stay in this area and avoid transferring subway line with bulky luggage. My advice is to stay anywhere exit 8 or 9 as this is where its all busy and exciting place."
122,4.0,"Went in May 2015.  Many things to see, more of an artistic place to roam and many youths were there performing. Should go"
123,3.0,"A few good blocks of shopping. Items were on par with Myeongdong, but at slightly cheaper prices. Knock offs and local goods mostly and not many designer brands if that's your thing. Worth an hour or two if you have some shopping to do but not for luxury goods."
124,1.0,Lots of cheap clothes for students and some not so exceptional  restaurants.  This is the only area Korea where we saw grafitti on the walls and garbage on the streets. Nothing in this area worth seeing unless you are absolutely bored out of your mind and have nowhere else to go.
125,4.0,"if you like to shop, and have a few drinks after dinner. This is definitely the place to come. It's packed with boutiques, cosmetic and make up houses for those who likes to shop, and they have varieties of pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes all over the place. Explore the narrow alleys and you might stumble upon a neat hangout."
126,5.0,"a nice place to hang around in the evening / nite. Nice bars and restaurants, fab atmosphere and some good shopping as well for cheap and trendy stuff."
127,3.0,"clouded w/local youngsters, street music. a place for you to shop for cheap cosmetic, fashion and trendy item."
128,5.0,Best for teen's to hangout & to appreciate music like hip hop Pop or buskingBest crowd & lots of cafes & shops to look at.
129,3.0,"This place is close to Hongyik University and more vibrant compared to Ewha Women's University fashion street, which I visited earlier. There are many more restaurants but there seems to be more fashion shops in Ewha.I personally prefer Ewha as the place is less crowded. If you like a vibrant place, this is worth a visit to experience a young atmosphere."
130,5.0,"The area around Hongik University is fantastic, always something going on. Lots of street performances, cheap restaurants around the area. Pojangmachas (tteokbokki, odaeng) and mobile clothes shops are also found there.Easily accessible. Nice place if you like it lively."
131,3.0,A little over blown in the brochures from what we could see. The art work is just okay. Music in evenings is kinda cool.  The restaurants are nicely priced though. Great bbq.
132,2.0,"Maybe it was just me. But I found the place intolerably loud and crowded. The street performance like magic and K-pop was lack of talent. I was curious how this place was rated so high by most people here. But if you're 16 and are bored with country life, it may be a different story."
133,4.0,"The place has lot of trendy nice cafe. With unique shops selling mostly women stuff and nice restaurants filing up the streets here, a lot of youngster can be seen. Worth half a day visit. I visited around noon time and alot of shops are still not open yet. Go there in late afternoon."
134,4.0,"We stayed in Hongdae and this street was only a few minutes from our apartment.It is an eating mecca and also has lots of smaller shops.  Cafes are everywhere and there are desserts and chocolate things too.  Definitely a great area for staying when you visit Seoul, as you can get coffee and breakfast in the morning and dinner at night with ease."
135,4.0,"The livelihood of this street doesn't really stops. It's like discovery of one after another; row of eatery shops (lots of beer and chicken shops!), youth performing with their guitars, some dancing around in weird costumes, and screaming exciting fan girls over their local celebrity. All in one! I would have wanted to study at this area during my uni days! The clubbing are all located here as well, but we didn't manage to hop into one. Too tired by then!"
136,4.0,"had the best street food here since it's full of university students, it's always busy and full of life in Hongdae. at night time it gets even busier and most restaurants stay open late, budget friendly shops and places to eat! a great place to go for a bite, shop and feel the crowd!"
137,4.0,"the place are so crowded , but the place are so great u can buy anything from the cheapest until the expensive things there , and so many club there , the bad thing when night is come in street u can see so many trush"
138,5.0,"This is a nice place to spend an evening. It has a really nice vibe and some pretty cool stores. There is LOADS of food options. It is worth asking a local, which are worth going to, as it can be quite overwhelming with choices."
139,4.0,"Regardless of your age, whether you want to dance or drink or eat the night away or all of the above, this is the perfect neighborhood for you.  If you're older, this is where you can soak the energy of youngsters, if you're a youngster, enjoy your youth!  I knocked one star off my review because everytime I come here I drink and party too much."
140,4.0,"Lively place on weekends, with a largely young university crowd. Like the EWHA University street nearby, Hongik (or Hongdae as other would call it) is home to several shops, boutiques, cafes and eateries catered to the younger folks. It's perfect for leisurely afternoon strolls. We were in the area for a touristy photoshoot at Goguan Studio (at Seogyo Plaza where the trick eye museum is; quite fun photoshoot experience), and had also treated ourselves to really awesome Korean fried chicken at Kyochon Fried Chicken (Seogyo-dong 362-15; closer to university entrance).Those who like bazaars would be glad to see the various shops set up by the students during the weekends, selling a variety of things from jewellery, clothes, Kpop souvenirs, to snacks and drinks. There is not as much emphasis on cosmetics/beauty product stores in Hongdae as EWHA University street, but then again this is not really surprising since it's not a ""women's"" street ;)"
141,3.0,"Very lively place with lots of street food, cafes and small shops. But be mindful of the prices, especially when shopping because the shopkeepers can be dishonest. One tried to accept a larger bill I gave because I was not familiar."
142,4.0,"Lots of street food and stores selling cosmetic products and clothes. We found prices here to be slightly cheaper than those offered at Myeongdong, and the day crowds were also lesser here. It's a good place to walk around to shop casually and to sit down at the numerous cafes to chill out once tired."
143,4.0,You can find kinda lots of food and nice coffee shop here BUT do not try to look for Coffee Prince No. 1 (Korea drama) as you will disappointed!!
144,5.0,"A very happening area in the night, with many stalls open selling accessories, clothes, bags and various whatnots, not forgetting streetfood! The hotteok there is one of the best I've had in Korea, and the time I went, there was quite a line too. There are plenty of bars too if you want to pop in and have a drink and relax. We did not check out the clubbing scene but there were a few clubs that we passed by which looked pretty crowded."
145,3.0,"There's absolutely nothing unique about this street, other than the fact it features several clubs and where the youngsters come to party.As a Korean street, however, it lacks any charm.There are also some stores to shop in and a small market in the area."
146,5.0,"Here you can find all kinds of food and fashion! In the night you can find all kinds of nice winebars, clubs and anything else, there's something for each and everyone here!Don'r come here from  early morning to early afternoon things start to happen!"
147,4.0,"This is by far my favorite area in Seoul. I love the indie/free thinking vibe in this neighborhood. There are so many good restaurants, bars and shops. This is also the area to visit if you enjoy sseing live music, in particular Punk and alternative music. The small park across from the university has a weekend art market. Most weekend nights there will be some type of free live music in the park or even spontaneous breakdance or freestyle rap battles. As with most places in Seoul, be prepared for huge crowds at night and during the weekend. There are alot of dance clubs in the area and the partying doesn't stop until well after the sun has come up the next morning. Expect to see a lot of drunk people staggering around. If you're not familiar with Korea you may be concerned by this, but it's a safe area and public intoxication is not a crime here. You will see people passed out drunk in the street and police officers helping them. Be sure to get a piece of pizza at Monster Pizza, probably the best pizza in all of Korea."
148,5.0,"So, this place is filled with lots of snacks and small,cheap shops. Like literally, cheap! The clothes sold here are mostly for university students or young workers, so has lots of choices for my hubby and me. A lot of accessories and socks shops too.."
149,4.0,i liked their culture and life style there. very happening especially during weekend. Their youngsters very energetic.
150,5.0,"We loved this street in the Hongdae area that we visited it twice. The first time was on a Saturday morning, specifically for the Hongdae Free Market, which is a flea and arts market. It has a ton of interesting trinkets, as well as, quality goods, that are korean-owned. We bought leather passport covers, and a triangle leather coin pouch from one of the sellers called Jayne. She makes them all in her free time, so it felt really good to support actual artisans and craftspeople. At the market, were also a few carts selling snacks and food, do not miss the kebabs, which was heavenly on a blistery cold morning, and then after that, an ""ice-pie"", which is a waffle circle loaded with ice-cream! yum. We also took a light lunch at a nearby cafe, and watched young stylish Koreans out and about. If you are a street-style watcher, this is the place to be to see chic, creative and unique sartorial statements.The second visit was the next Saturday night, and by 7pm, the whole street was bustling. It was a mini celebration, as it was near Halloween, but also the general atmosphere was lively, with musicians and street performers. We walked along the streets, got a bit lost, settled for heavenly galbi that did not break the bank USD12 per person for a lot of beef, and simply soaked in the sights.The cafes are full with the youths, while the restaurants attract a slightly wealthier patronage, so if you are looking for a relatively quiet place to sit and enjoy the night, definitely forgo the cafes. The restaurants will be a better bet. That night, we shopped, the prices were affordable as the base demographic were students, and ate lots of street snacks. The highlight would have to be the ice-mango desserts, that are similar to Japanese and Taiwanese version, but it completely Korean in its own right.Wear comfortable shoes, be friendly, and just soak it all in!"
151,5.0,"Located in the hustling Hong Dae school district, Hongik University street is PACKED with shops, restaurants, bars and not to mention the cutest cafes ever to take a break - you really must check out the hello kitty café if you're in the area and try out the dduk bok ki at Jok Bo Duk Bokki. On Saturdays during the mid afternoon, a bunch of street vendors come to show off their handmade skills - ranging from dolls, to purses, to fans, paintings, etc. the shopping craze was endless! Most of it is definitely geared towards females, so if you love super cute and trendy items, this shopping mecca is for you!"
152,5.0,"Great street at night. The neighborhood is vibrant and packed with terrific, well-priced restaurants. The bars and clubs cater to the young college crowd, but there are live music sets performed in parks with real talent and draw big crowds."
153,4.0,"Lots of shopping, eating and clubbing options. Very crowded, but that's to be expected. Great night life, lots of variety."
154,5.0,"Great alternative atmosphere,live street music,found some great clothes at cheap prices.Uni students have a flea market on weekends and I bought some cute bags and purses made by the students themselves."
155,4.0,"This is a lovely area to visit. During the day it is the perfect place to do some shopping if you are after something different. Different goods, different levels of prices. We found some lovely leather bags in this area.Towards the evening the area becomes this bustling festival: there is singing, dancing, ice cream shops full of people, cafes and bars all packed with students.. Very lively but could seem a bit crowded for those who appreciate the quiet and the peace."
156,3.0,"Recommended for the younger crowd. its quite a walk and note that the ""garden"" next to the university isnt actually a real garden or park! They do sell interesting clothes and catered for the youth."
157,3.0,We went to the street on a weekend...it was really crowdy with the students but i liked..lot of performances were going on...i guess by the students...one can relish his/her university time moments.
158,4.0,"What used to be an area for indie culture and artists is now collapsing under the weight of its reputation.  Boutiques and small bars are being replaced by H&M and Forever 21s and Taco Bell.  Most of the visitors on weekends are there for the nightlife - clubbing or the occasional punk show or drinking in the hilariously named Children's Park.  I find that Sinchon has better shopping, but there is always something going on in Hongdae."
159,5.0,"On weekends the street is deliciously lively and provides all kinds of entartainment - funky museums, gorgeous street food, funny shopping, busking, impromptu performances and even secluded romantic wine bars"
160,5.0,"Go to Hongik (or Hongdae in Korean) and explore this young area. Don't hesitate to go far in the neighborhood, between Honkig station and Sinchon station (exit 8 or 9 from hongik station). You can try to find the trick eye museum (which is a bit pricy though) or the hidden Toy Museum.In the afternoon, take a break in a coffee shop (not Starbucks or a big brand), try a small one with a unique theme (like the Coffee Lab for exemple). Then take your time, go in the small street and don't hesitate to enter in the small shops.And at night, it's one of the most popular places of Seoul to go clubbing : M2, SK@, NB2,... Just remember that this is a students area so you will mostly be partying with students.Anyway my main advice is to just take your time there and don't hesitate to go explore the smalls streets."
161,5.0,"What a vibrant area! Lot's of young students, restaurants, bars, shops, cafes etc. Just a very cozy place you can spend several hours in. Make sure to check out all the small streets around the area, you'll find some gems in there. We had such a nice time, we ended up coming back three times. Food seems a bit cheaper here as well (maybe cos it's a uni. area)."
162,4.0,We love walking around Hongik University. You would feel that you are a student once again. There are lots of shops to look at and restaurants.
163,3.0,"Good place to do shopping, lot of fashionable youngster surrounding probably uni students, got one halal restaurants next to cat cafe,street-performer,don't miss this out."
164,5.0,"The city of Hongdae is brilliant. Love the restaurants, cafes and shopping there. Especially at night time you will get to see many street performers, feels like part of them! People-watching is great too, many funky and fashionable youngsters hangout there. It's a must go place in Seoul!"
165,5.0,"Surrounded with lots of creative cafes, restaurants and fashion. Its no wonder its a heaven to all young kids and tourist. A worthy destination to be if you want nice fashion & cozy cafe to rest your tired feet."
166,4.0,"Hongdae is a very happening area. The nightlife culture is great around Seoul in general, but very evident in Hongdae as there is a large concentration of college students/young adults. The food spots and cafes are endless. You shouldn't go hungry in this area for sure... If you're uncomfortable with the language there are 7-Elevens and shops of the like around where you can just go in, pick something, take it to the register & pay without speaking a word of Korean.Hongdae is located/situated pretty well in Seoul as most major attractions aren't that far. I used Sangsu and Hapjeong Station the most when using metro. I also used the limousine bus service (Bus 6002 Route) from the airport (Incheon) which dropped me off right in front of Hapjeong Station. I loved Hongdae and I'm glad I stayed in this area vs Itaewon! As a tourist, I think it's better to eat and look around in Itaewon, but not to stay there as you miss the true Korean experience. Cheers!"
167,5.0,"Came here on a Monday night and the place was still very busy although it was close to 8pm. Lots of eateries, club and interesting shops, some more mainstream, some vintage, some more indie... didn't get much as I was just window shopping. Plenty of cafes as well to people watch. Many buskers on the streets even though it was probably close to 0 degrees Celsius when we visited. Love the vibe, would certainly come back again. Also if you watch Running Man, Haha's restaurant is located 5 min away from the main Hongdae thoroughfare."
168,4.0,This place is a must visit if you are looking for trendy outfits. Your eyes will really feast on the bargains you will see while exploring the streets of Hongik University.
169,5.0,"Plenty of less-stressful shops than dongdaemun :)There's a lot to shop here, as well as quite a number of Korean BBQ restaurants. Good place to bargain if you are up for it. I got called 'bad-boy' by one of the sales staff as he let me have the requested price ;)"
170,4.0,"This was an area with a lot of shopping, bars and restaurant. Most of the shops were small and this was an area where clothes were cheaper. Local clothes and young fashion wear. As it gets later, there are more people and the main streets are pretty packed. I went there mainly to shop and did end up buying a lot."
171,5.0,Hongdae is such a quirky place! There are a lot of cozy coffee shops and stores/stalls that sell unique and cute things. The wall graffiti works in the open area where they hold the Free Market on Saturdays was cool!
172,5.0,"This was a great area to explore at night.  Keep a look out for fried chicken places, this area does it really well.  We got there too late to see the flea markets, but they're on every Saturday and Sunday until about 6pm.  Great atmosphere, lots of choices."
173,4.0,"This area is for everyone! It is vibrant, crowded, surprising and a lot of fun. One can feel the exuberance from the crowded streets. Full of cosmetic shops, fashion shops and cafes it is must-see place for all visitors. When we were there live bands were performing to enthusiastic audiences and creating a wonderful atmosphere. The variety of international cuisine was amazing."
174,5.0,"This place is so awesome! I love to listen to street bands around the corner of the park, feel like 60s, but so young and energetic. Although I didn’t understand most of the songs (the Korean ones) but their vocal and harmony were so great. The place was full of young people, such a different side of Seoul after a day visiting ancient places."
175,5.0,"A place where you can shop for latest youth fashion, chill out at little cafes, dine at fushion restaurants and in the evening, party at the hottest clubs. Expenses in this district is considerated as reasonable as it caters mainly to students from the university."
176,5.0,Full of shops and cafes as well as foreign restaurants. Here you will find cute little shops selling limited items but sizes are all small that a size xl is nowhere to be found. Cheapest cotton top is 10000 won. Don't forget to try the street foods a lot of students are eating especially the one with a whole egg on top.The trick eye museum is located near taco bell.
177,3.0,Free market was interesting but it only happens on Saturdays 1 - 6pm. The rest of the Hongdae is somewhat similar to other areas.
178,4.0,"Stayed and wondered this part of Seoul, really good feel, with random live performances.A lot of good value meal options all around this area.Some good shopping too."
179,5.0,"During the day, its great for hanging out withfriends and mingling with not only the locals, but trendy foreigners as well. At night, it boast a large amount of clubs and bars. Also, check out the art exhibits closer to the Univ. entrance"
180,4.0,the back streets of hongdae are filled with interesting little shops and places to meander during the day. the area certainly comes into its own in the evening - bars and nightclubs abound and its a great place to have a night out in seoul.
181,4.0,"Lots of streetfood, great cheap shopping and chilled out people! A really friendly place to hang out. Fun to stay at!"
182,5.0,"Hongkik University has it's own stop on line 2 of the subway.   We discovered this area when we went to the Trick Eye Museum (definitely worth a visit).    There are an amazing number of bars and restaurants in the area.  Had we known earlier, we would have gone every day!"
183,4.0,"we had the best food in the Hongik University area - the Army stew, the pig's trotter, boiled pork, seafood soup etc! and prices are reasonable as compared to the restaurants in Myeodong - but of course! since Myeodong is a tourist belt. we went back again for lunch.there are many cafes, some more quaint than others. and apparently, it's a super happening place at night when there will be many people partying away! quite a few drinking places too, and cheap alcohol.and there are alot of shops there as well where you can find relatively cheap clothing, accessories and stationery. but you can't try on the sales items that are displayed on the racks outside the shops. It's pretty quiet on weekday afternoons, but the crowd starts forming in the evening where you will see many youngsters thronging the streets. they're probably from the Uni. it is worth making a trip down to the Hongik Uni area, which is a nice change from the touristy Myeodong."
184,4.0,"The streets surrounding Hongik University are filled with trendy shops and interesting cafes. Be adventurous and venture out into the small side streets - there always something interesting just around the corner. There are also a number of cats/dogs cafes in this area - great for animal lovers, those who miss their pets back home and first dates (as I have observed). Stick around at night for good street side shopping and entertainment. You may even see some cool pop-up performing artists performing in the ""square"" behind the main street."
