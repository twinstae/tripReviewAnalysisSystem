0,4.0,The mall is huge and you can buy almost anything you need. Parking is not difficult with payment deferred if you shop. The supermarket is also big and complete. Lines are not too long and there is a tax refund options if you bring your passport. You can spend the whole day here with a lot of food choices and variety of stores.
1,5.0,"This department store has basically everything you need. From mid range to luxury fashion items. Various range of restaurants in the food court. But for now , clothes are mostly geared for winter. At the same period , most bases are covered."
2,4.0,"After visiting Lotte world, a visit to the department store just flow naturally. The mall is huge and as per instinct we drifted unto the basement and in search of food. Not disappointed as I am able to sample and buy some of the local delicacies. We also bought some food items and wears from the department store."
3,3.0,"Came here to see one of the major departmental store in Seoul.  One thing to note:. They close at 8.30 pm on weekends (8pm on weekdays).  Didn't notice this unusually early closure for a Korean business.  Anyway lots of brands (luxury) here as with major departmental stores do.  But in a bizarre twist, there wasn't a toy section here.   A sign indicated that it was relocated to Star Avenue but subsequently was not found either.  More about that later.If you are looking for bargains, there won't be any.  If you ask me, they seemed targeted at the Chinese market primarily.  They even have Chinese translators at the ground floor with many staff who can speak Mandarin.  So we know who are their target customers.Anyway, about the Star Avenue, it was first a waste of time looking for the toy section there as it turned out to be a passageway outside featuring famous Korean stars.  Now they have these palm imprints (of the stars) on metal plates along this passageway where u r supposed to be able to bring up a video of this star when I place your palm on it.  It didn't work for most of them.  So don't waste your time.  Stick to YouTube."
4,3.0,"The mall itself was no biggie, just like any other big brand mall in Asia. Was pleasantly surprised with their foodcourt in the basement. Reminded me of those high standard ones in Tokyo. Getting to an elevator took a lot of patience.."
5,4.0,"The place is composed OF The whole Building. IT has everything you want to buy. Above floors are for shopping whole The basement is The supermarket and Food court. After shopping, prices are reasonable, we ate at The Food court at Panda express. There are a lot OF choices for Food, desserts and confections. A good half a day to spend."
6,5.0,Staying at the Lotte Hotel Seoul gave us the easy excess to this department store as it's just a walking distance down the escalator from the hotel lobby. It is so huge and down below the department stores are the supermarket and dining area. We manage to grab our lunch here at the food section.
7,4.0,"It was a weekday yet so very crowded! The mall is very big and has many floors. I recommend to check the directory for what each floor offers, so that you can better understand where to go. Otherwise you spend a lot of time navigating thru the crowds and floors. There are some floors dedicated for duty free shopping, which seemed the most crowded with shoppers pulling trolley bags to contain their things. Be prepared for the long queue to make payment for your shopping goods!"
8,5.0,"This one of the main department stores in Seoul.  It is comprehensive in that it has a large food court, clothing, beauty, travel and many other features.It was an easy walk here from my hotel Prince hotel.  Directly across the street is a large street market area in Myeongdong.A great store to shop in.  It gives you a cultural understanding of Seoul."
9,5.0,"This Western department store is massive, with endless amounts of shopping! The food options are fabulous (but don't eat at Elbon on the 14th floor!!!). They offer substantial dining options downstairs, and nicer restaurants on the 13th and 14th floors (only accessible using the hotel elevators, the department elevators only reach the 10 floor).There is a Krispy Kreme in the basement if you're homesick for America, and go deeper to find the Euljiro 1 metro stop on the #2 line (green line). It's a pretty impressive destination if you happen to be in the area."
10,5.0,"Amazing shopping center that seems to have anything that you wold need. It is really large so it can be quite hard to find specific items. We stopped by before heading off to get tteokbokki chips, among other things. They have empty boxes available  at the checkout for carrying items. There is also tape and ribbon to pack the boxes. We essentially packed what we brought and left for the airport."
11,5.0,"We stayed at Crown Park Hotel which is across from this mall. It is huge dept store that sells duty free brand items. Global Blue tax free shopping onsite. It has many floors with clothes that are pricey.  I love the food court!!! lots of choices, appealing display of cookies, pastries, cakes, street food items... etc. We eat here all the time before going back to our hotel."
12,4.0,"In Lotte Department Store you can find a lot of shops: Chanel, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Kakao friends, Line friends and more.  Mostly I liked basement floor. There are many foods and drinks. You should go to Ops! and Tea Museum. W Lotte Department Store można znaleść wiele różnych sklepów np. Chanel, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Kakao Friends, Line Friends i wiele innych. Najbardziej polecam poziom -1, gdzie można znaleść jedzenie i picie. Polecam szczególnie: Ops! i Tea Museum."
13,3.0,Lotte Department store is a luxury mall with high end brands inside of it. There's some food court on the basement. We visited this place just for window shopping and seeing its nice interior.
14,4.0,"Nice, worth a visit. Many tourist especially from mainland China. Not all are cheap but not all are expensive. U have to know the price at other place before comparing."
15,4.0,"Large luxurious department store. Luxurious prices too!Food halls in the basement are nice, elaborate and offer a wide selection of gourmet foods. If you're looking to have lunch, the choices are mainly Asian food. Not much in terms of diverse western cuisine. However, for Korean, Japanese, Chinese food you're well taken care of. Self service, but stalls offer a broad variety of choices.Upstairs this is a typical department store. You can find many brands that are popular in Asia, but perhaps less so in the USA. Restaurants on the 13th and 14th floors are Asian as well. Again mainly Korean, Chinese, Japanese."
16,5.0,Lotte department store is a hub for all of the world class brands and also the korean ones. The basement have a huge gourmet stores and a grocery store. Also it have a huge cinema theater next to it
17,4.0,"Lotte department store is one of the best shopping centre in Seoul.It  Interesting and there are many products.Also,It next to Lotte hotel.There are Taxi free in (9,10,11 and firsr floor).There are many good shops .In my opinion if you have kids you should comewonderful design cloth  and cool deal.Women products Paris and Milan are more cheaper for woman hand bags and shoes."
18,4.0,"This is definitely a good place to go if you can afford such brands: most of the brands there are more on the high end side e.g. MCM, Gucci etc. There is a bargain basement (where most people were there) and also a great food court (I hanged around there for most of the time). I am not sure if its a must go place because it is just a department store full of stores that are in fact on streets as well."
19,4.0,"We were there on Silent Night and Christmas Day, which was crowded with people, in particular on floors 7 or up for imported brands and tax refund service. There are almost every leading world brands of bags, cloths and accessories coming. Just coming out from Incheon Airport, special shopping coupons at Lotted Department Store are seen everywhere. But the terms and conditions are not user friendly such that deterring customers from using it eventually. The inner design and layout of the department store seems a bit old, in compare with its entrance and ground floor design. On floor 8th, there was a bridge connecting to nearby Lotte Young Plaza. One catching note is, there are mouth wash steriliser and cups facilities for customers to have mouth wash, fantastic!"
20,4.0,"If you haven't been to large department stores in London and Tokyo, this is the one you can definitely go to experience the feeling of walking through a massive department store that not only sells clothes, but also groceries and food.  This flagship department store is similar to other department stores in that it sells plenty of clothes, home kitchen supplies, and other items.However, you really want to visit the basement of this store to see the groceries and food sections.  It did seem to be a little smaller than the basement food sections of department stores you see in Tokyo (e.g. Ginza), but it is still worthwhile to visit.  There are plenty of high end groceries (especially meats and seafood - and your expensive fruits and melons) at really high-end prices.  There are also plenty of small restaurants and stalls selling take away food and snacks, so allow yourself some time to go through the basement...The store is also conveniently located next to the subway line so it makes it quite easy to visit."
21,3.0,Very crowded department store. Suffocated during my visit. Beauty products are offering at better price. It is a good place if you are planning to buy things in bulk.
22,3.0,"This was our first family visit to Seoul with the in-laws, stayed at the Lotte Hotel World which is close to where family lives in Jamsil.  As an American, I prefer my South Coast Plaza/Nordstrom/Macy's, but this was convenient to have close by.  We were able to purchase a nice birthday gift duty-free for my mother-in-law's birthday celebration.  However, most the items were high-end luxury items, not necessarily the brands I would shop at home.  The food court and grocery store in the basement were convenient to have around, as were the Korean restaurants on the 11th floor.  Don't eat at the other ethnic restaurants--the Indian, Italian, Vietnamese food taste weird and are not authentic.  Stick with Korean, and the Japanese is OK.  The customer service is OK.  I feel smothered because they tail you as soon as you enter an area or show interest in an area.  I like having my independence and personal space.  If you are looking for more affordable shopping, go the the sections of the store bordering Lotte Mart -- there are some domestic low-cost brands there as well as a Zara.  Or walk further into the new mall at the Lotte World Tower, there is a Gap, Banana Republic, etc.  Or go to the basement into the subway area, there are tons of local stores and chains that sell items for $10-20."
23,4.0,"Bring your passport to get duty-free benefit. The Lotte department store is usually busy with tourists. The staff were friendly and helpful despite being overrun by so many people. Overall a nice mall. The food court is busy and good eats. Prices are good too, especially with discounts and tax free if you have a foreign passport."
24,4.0,"It contains 3 blocks of building, linked with footbridges, suitable for different people from young shopper to luxury brands lovers.You can find all you want here.  Not too crowded except the top few floors of Duty Free Shops, with all the chinese crowded buying different cosmetic items.Convenience location near subway station."
25,5.0,"There are more than 10 floors of shopping with the Lotte Hotel in one of the wings.  The duty free shop is on the 10th Floor, Supermarket on the lower ground with food court. We took subway and exit at Euljiro 3 to get to this HUGE MALL after our visit to Nami Island"
26,5.0,"This place is awesome .Nice ,big, staff are friendly  .Clean There three building there There cinema Prices  reasonable Raining day still provide plastic holder for wet umbrella Love this place"
27,5.0,"A great place for shopping or just hang around. Good touristy places too like the ""Stars avenue"". Located right in the heart of Myeongdong shopping district. 10-15 minutes walk from the metro station."
28,4.0,"10th floor on ward is Duty Free! Bring your passport if you want to shop here!At here, only need to show your passport and they will do everything in order for you to shop for duty free product.Must visit the concierge first in advance to know all sort of promotion for all sorts of credit. I gotten my Silver VIP Privilege Card for free due to credit card promotion. (Forgotten which bank promotion). But not all shop giving extra discount for VIP Privilege Card though. Better than nothing."
29,2.0,"Yeah, this place is super super crowded, particular at the Duty Free shops at 9th and 10th floor. It feels like you are at a fish market or something, except that you are shopping for luxury brands and cosmetics. And don't be surprised, most people there are Chinese and even the staffs speak Chinese. They seem to have special promotion for foreigners from China."
30,2.0,"THE GOODThis mall have the american brand and branded ones. If you want to buy the expensive brand this is the right place for you. YOu can have your Tax refund here.THE TO IMPROVEThis mall is very complicated when you are transferring to another, you can get lost. It close very early. it close 8pm. hoping they extend it."
31,2.0,"I didnt like it and i didnt waste my time in that place not because it was not good, but because the prices in my country are cheaper than the prices here. It is well organized and has lots of choices"
32,4.0,"We only stayed in the capital for 4 days, and this was the nicest mall we were able to visit. Not big enough for me, but maybe I am just used to the large malls we have in Manila. Was able to eat a salad at the food court. Supermarket was disappointing though. Not enough seaweed in my opinion."
33,2.0,We were disappointed with the selection of stores. We got the impression that Seoul would emphasise it's fashion outlets but there was little in the way of decent clothing. The entire mall contained sportswear shops and restaurants. Though there is an aquarium and cinema.
34,1.0,"I asked price of few items in parfume department, there was no price sighn , I asked price for Chanel Madumasel, 100 ML AND got answer with f.....  210000 won  which is double priced, and chanel blue same story. Prices for clouthes too high, I avood to do any shoping here. After I went to duty free wich is on flor 9 to 11, Prices here was beter but still not cheap, for example suveniers has double priced, same u can buy much cheaper in marked. Parfume prices was in USD dollars, wich is not handy for me.So I very disapointed, avoid this place.  To many people to crowdy, and nosy"
35,2.0,"Make no mistake, the Lotte Dept. Store in Central Seoul near Euljiro 1-ga offers world-class merchandise. You will be completely overwhelmed by the breadth and quality of what you can buy at Lotte, whether it may be high fashion, food, or practically anything else.That said, the shopping experience leaves a lot to be desired. For example, half of the B1 level is an amazing food store, with Korean groceries, international delicacies, prepared food to take home or to eat on premise. But the floor itself is not optimally laid out, there are too many people and the ceilings are extremely low. I am also not a fan of the faux Baroque architecture typically found in Lotte stores.Once you experience B1, try to get to the Duty Free floors (9th-11th), which is likely the main reason to visit Lotte. First of all, I challenge you to find an elevator, let alone one you will be able to fit into. Once you get to the floors you will be completely overwhelmed by tourists! Times Square at Christmas is a cakewalk compared to this. My wife, who loves to shop and grew up in Seoul, swears she will never visit the Lotte Duty Free area again.The other issue with Lotte is the relative lack of subway access. You can directly access the subway #2 line at Euljiro 1-ga but this is the loop line. You will likely need to transfer or walk to a better Metro station. Even if you are staying north of the Han River (Kang-buk) you are better off visiting the Shinsegae branch at the Express Bus Terminal south of the river in Kangnam. It's less crowded and the overall experience is better. There is no Duty Free floor but that's a plus in my book. I recommend staying away especially if you have kids with you."
36,3.0,"I have to say that the entire Lotte World is not well designed.  Maybe because I am a foreigner, I am used to things being designed for the masses, where everything that can go wrong, will go wrong, so you try to make things idiot proof for the first time visitor.  Like, this whole complex, the department store, the amusement park, etc, are all integrated into downtown Seoul.  Not the city center, but a side city, Songpa-gu.  In other words, Lotte World is the majority of Songpa-gu.  That being said, it is hard to figure out where Lotte World begins, and where it ends.  There is no guidance on where to go.  It is just there.  Park somewhere, figure it out.  No shuttles, no monorails, no people to tell you where to go. Just start walking and figure it out. But this is true of all of South Korea.  All of the signs inside, like where to find the bathroom or this or that, only get you half way there.  Seriously, you will follow a sign, and then there is no sign, and the thing you are looking for is nowhere to be found.  It is the most frustrating thing I have encountered.  It is almost like they said, we'll do you a favor, but not really. And that could not be worse in a city where the temperature and the humidity both hover around 90. You will need a shower before you find a drink of water.Sticking to topic, the department store:  So, the front entrance is kind of there where the hotel entrance is, and I see people getting off of buses, I guess for the amusement park.  But where do I go?  I just want to buy this damn toy helicopter that my girlfriend's kid who keeps asking for it over and over and over.  So, inside, am I near the department store?  Hell if I know. Finally, after wandering around, I find a long hallway that leads to some stores, and hey, there is a toys r us. I found the helicopter, but only after my friends bus had left. Different cultures, I guess."
37,5.0,"Lotte department full of varies food , I relly like there cookies , example: lotte chocolate pie and mints."
38,4.0,"they have a huge food center. the price is bit higher than the street price but for traveler which worry about hygiene, this is a great place. you can taste almost all the local food here. we love this place. for others stuffs, you can spend half a day just to walk see all the stuffs here. for level 9 is there the duty free place, you can get good bargain cosmetic products. for girls, this is shopping heaven  :). please make sure you know bring your visa platinum card. you get extra discount % :)"
39,4.0,"all things mostly very expensive, more expensive if you compared from my city (Jakarta), but i fall in love with the food court down on the bottom floor. lots of food vierity there, asian and western all are availble. price might be costly but if you feel the taste and quantity its worth, i been eating here for 2 times, and always i need to share my food, you can say, 1 portion sufficent for 2. taste also amazing, so fit with my taste. love the food court heaps :)"
40,5.0,"I like to visit food courts,all over the world in department stores.I think that they offer great opportunities to discover food cultures.Lotte Food departmant was amazing.We took tasty foods from food section.There was a comfortable sitting area inside.I mostly like baked korean sweet patatoes.It is worth a visit for a lunch."
41,4.0,"Anything you want, from the budget items to the highest level (they even had a section of Gucci for Kids), with a large variety of everything... It was especially crowded on the sale floor, so best avoid that unless you really want something from there.Good variety of gadgets and sunglasses despite this being a non-speciality store."
42,5.0,"This is a luxury department store in the center of Seoul downtown, but what we found to be most impressive and very special is the food court in the basement of the department store. You do not want to miss this experience! It was one of our best dining experiences in Seoul."
