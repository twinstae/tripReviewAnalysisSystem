1,5.0,"The area is almost always awake. In the morning you can go shopping and at night you can enjoy one of the many available bars, clubs, and restaurants in the area. It was interesting to see almost everyone communicating in English here."
2,3.0,"We visited this place at night. This area is for the young. Bars, clubs, restaurants,Karaoke and dance venues. The music is deafening and the crowds of young people in the back alleys are beyond belief. Not much different to other cities of the world to areas that attract young people. Go to observe if you are a bit long in the tooth or partake if you are young."
3,2.0,"I went to Itaewon because many Malaysian travellers recommended this place for the mosque and halal food and because I wanted to try Plant Cafe. The mosque was great - it's located uphill and you can get a view of Seoul from there. However, Itaewon feels and look tacky. Definitely not the best part of Seoul. Not worth visiting again in future, except if I want to eat at Plant Cafe again."
4,3.0,"We visited Itaewon to drink Korean craft beer. We went to Booth and Magpie, both were great. An interesting part of the city."
5,4.0,I’m not sure if the food stalls is a staple here but it was an awesome atmosphere. Lots of people with great food. The aroma will surely make you hungry
6,3.0,Used to have great shopping from numerous small shops selling everything. Now some shops but nothing special. A fair amount of bars and restaurants with great selection of food and drink. We did not feel it was worth the effort to visit but did have a great lunch.
7,4.0,Popularly known as expat area. You can find variety of shops and restaurants serving cuisines from all around the world. Vibrant nightlife. Local Korean brands shopping. It was difficult to get a taxi back to hotel on Saturday night.For cheese pizza lovers i  highly recommend to visit Pizza Revolution.
8,3.0,"First visited 2 years ago with friends and saw different parts in the evening. There are many interesting shops and once we had some beer at an independent brewery and another time we had ice cream in a Turkish cafe. This time when we returned at midday it seemed quiet and lifeless. I liked the greetings in different languages on the pavements but there wasn't much else to enjoy. Perhaps best visiting at night for a lively vibe but Hongdae, Insadong and Myeongdong might be more interesting."
9,2.0,"I have been dragged to Itaewon a couple of times and for me, it's not very interesting. It looks/feels tacky and it is quite an average part of Seoul, I don't understand the hype here. There are much better places in Seoul to eat and spend your money. Many people are saying it is foreigner friendly, but almost everywhere in Korea is foreigner friendly. The locals do whatever they can to accommodate you. I feel if you come to Korea, you should experience the real Korea and not somewhere that feels like the West/home."
10,4.0,The area is good for food and drink and night life everything is open for late .. too many restaurants and different cuisines.. Hala food and fast food .. and it have tooo many night clubs
11,3.0,"This place is full of bars, local & international cafes & restaurants.Every corner you turn, rows & rows of such F&B outlets catches your attention. In fact, there are more F& B than products shops. Noticeably there are also more Westerners ( saw quite a number of military men) here than in other places.If you are the type that likes to mainly shop (& dine local cuisines) in places like Myeongdong, Hongdae, Dongdaemun, Namdaemun & similar- then skip this place.Don't waste your time here. Or unless you have time to kill & have no where else to go. Like us , on the last day in Seoul.We skipped Itaewon in previous visit few years back.You can see from the many pictures that there are not many tourists here as compared to the other mentioned places.An interesting thing about Itaewon station is that it is the only one we have been to so far, that has both a Tourist Information office & a station information counter. Most stations don't even have a station information counter."
12,4.0,"This is a great neighbourhood to go explore for food and drink. The main street is abuzz with pubs and restaurants but we particularly liked the side streets and back lanes where it was quiet and filled with hidden cafes and intimate diners. The residential areas are also really nice to walk through. The closest subway station is conveniently close by, Itaewon Station."
13,4.0,"We stayed at apartment that we booked via Airbnb in Itaewon.. the surrounding is very clean and safe even on the weekend there is so many people gathering and drunk around the pub area... i never been feel so secure to walk around drunken group of people... beside we can easily find muslim friendly restaurant and street food... even some of the teksi drive dont know where is the mosques but u can reach by walk if u dare to climb the 'deadly' itaewon spa stairs... deadly mean the stair is very steep and hight... overall.. we love to stay at itaewon again for our 2nd trip.. in running man, they said.. itaewon land of freedom.. which mean.. people don't bother what u do.. just mind our own business in a good term, but it doesn't mean they are selfish and anti social..."
14,4.0,"Itaewon is a fun neighborhood of Seoul with a relaxed, youthful vibe. There is an endless supply of fabulous restaurants representing any type of cuisine you could want from around the world! There are also lots of interesting shops, many that you don't see elsewhere in Korea. My husband and I enjoy just strolling around looking for street art and murals in this neighborhood. There is a lot to see and do here!"
15,4.0,"Come to this area if you want a bit of of an international experience. What you will notice almost immediately is that there is a lot more English around. On shops, on menus, on signs and spoken as you walk the streets. You can find many different restaurants (Indian, Malaysian, Canadian, Tai, etc) that I have not seen in other areas. Sadly we noticed that Graffiti was also a lot more evident. If you have been travelling a while then sometimes the home coforts that can be found here are a nice indulgence, even if the prices are up to the higher end."
16,5.0,"Getting to Itaewon Station would be on Line 6 of the Seoul Subway.This place is probably one of the coolest area to visit in Seoul. I had the international feel here, with alot of restaurants serving international cuisines, many shopping areas with international brands, and an area where students (University or college kids can be seen. We went to this area both in the daytime, for lunch, and came back on a nightime. There is a lot of cool bars around. We witnessed a halloween parade here. It was really cool, there was a show on the streets and people were in costumes in celebration of the halloween. It was a pleasant dining experience in this area as there were a lot to choose from. The international feel or ambiance of this area added to its charm. This area is lovely, fun, and where many events seem to be happening."
17,2.0,"If you were a U.S. Military member and remember all the great times you had in Itaewon in the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's, well you are in for a shock.  Not a place to hang out or spend the night in.  Half of those hole in the wall clubs are off limits by USFK and many of the others are run down and closed.  The King Club, UN Club, Grand Ole Opera and East/West clubs are still there, but really are not what you were use to.I would not go there unless you were in a group (especially women that are alone).  And don't flash any cash or high value jewelry.There are several new eating establishments within the area behind the Hamilton Hotel.  All are ethnic based and served with a little Korean flair.  Korea is still a great place to visit and play in, but times have changed and Itaewon is ""Not What It Use To Be"".DDS"
18,3.0,A place with some cafe and bar. if u muslim go to this place because there is a mosque and halal food in this area
19,5.0,"My partner and I LOVE visiting Itaewon in the evenings. The night life is a blast, especially for a gay couple. Gay Hill is fin and loaded with gay bars. Hoe Hill is also always poppin and alive. If this isn't your scene, there are HUNDREDS of other very modern, fun bars all in walking distance of one another. 11pm to 5am has never gone by quicker!"
20,3.0,"There is a large US military base in this neighborhood - I believe it has been there since the Korean War. The base probably has influenced the types of shops and restaurants here. The shops are not high-end, but very diverse. The restaurants are crazy-diverse too. There is a lot going on here, day or night. I would recommend getting there by subway (line 6)."
21,3.0,"The Itaewon district offers a wide selection of various shops, street vendors, restaurants and pubs / bars.When visiting Seoul my fiancée and I spent about an hour or so in the area, before visiting one of the many (good) restaurants located here.It is okay for a quick visit or just to have been there, but in my opinion now that this one's been ticked off the list I would most likely not go back.The area is not bad in any way - it's just so many other nice areas to experience in Seoul.Note that many of the shops close between 8 pm and 9 pm."
22,5.0,A fun area to be strolling around.  Found small hole-in-the-wall coffee shop in the back alleys.  Streets are lined with restaurants from different countries.  Interesting public art in  front of buildings.  Would come again for art galleries and museum.
23,4.0,"This is definitely NOT a shopping area because everything seems expensive here even just an ordinary souvenir shirt where you can simply find anywhere at Seoul. I can see that this is the place where the expats hang out. But if you cross at the other street, Korean food here are so yummy! You grill your fresh meat at this said restaurants. Bar-b-que or grilled pork, Kim chi and vegetable wrap are the best! We kept coming back to Itaewon but we prefer where the locals eat and drink because they're the best resto with the best korean grilled pork and vegetable wrap ;)"
24,5.0,"We enjoyed being in Itaewon each time we visited, day or night, it’s just vibrant.The street stretch begins and ends with and arch like structure on road saying Welcome to Itaewon. It’s a must visit place when in Seoul, it’s a place where one would definitely go crazy for shopping and Halal food options. Be it ice cream  or Korean, Indian, Arabic or any cuisine, it’s just awesome, it has free WIFI as well all over to update you whereabouts on social media instantly ;) LOLA perfect place to hangout wide variety of shopping for cosmetics, clothes, toys, souvenirs. One of the night when we visited we walked up hill to see how the ambience is like… there are many bars and restaurants. We walked a few steps in that lane and returned as it’s not our interest. On the last day of our visit after we enjoyed our meal it started pouring… and trust me that was the day….. me and my partner had fun filled afternoon… people are waiting for rains to stop and we were taking the pleasure to the most…. We packed all our stuff in a borrowed plastic bag and dumped in our bag… started making video of the street and water flowing… people were looking at our craziness and wondering what were we up to… common we were on Holiday!! Finally after about an hour it stopped pouring and we completely drenched took a cab back to our Hotel!We packed wonderful memories back home from Itaewon."
25,5.0,"Have stayed in Itaewon several times now and wouldn't go anywhere else in Seoul. The main street has always been full of shops and stalls, but the bars and restaurants are getting better and more numerous all the time. If you go down hill alongside the army base this area is also exploding and getting really exciting."
26,4.0,"But is that what you really want to do in Korea? Maybe sometimes. Itaewon is a nice district to hang out in now and then to get your western food cravings taken care of before heading back to wherever else in Korea you're going or living. I like it for its western feel, but it definitely can feel like a bubble for foreigners in the mid south of Seoul. Then again, so can Hongdae, the university district. Anyplace where young Koreans are attracted to are more likely to feel this way. I can recommend this district if you're feeling a particular hankering for familiar food or unfamiliar cute socks."
27,3.0,Just a street with stalls selling cheap fake Calvin Klein underwear and such. Side streets have multitude of fin restaurants and bars though
28,5.0,"Itaewon is the most attractive place that I have been to recently. There are mainly three reasons why I think Itaewon is the best place ever. They are location, various entertainments, and various atmospheres.    First, the location is very excellent. There are a lot of transportation and it is convenient to access. Thus, you can easily go to Itaewon from anywhere by various subways and buses. Moreover, because Itaewon is located in the center of Seoul, you can move easily and quickly to anywhere in Seoul from Itaewon. There is Namsan Mountain in the north and Gangnam in the south. You can go to Namsan Mountain if you want to feel the fresh air of nature, or you can go to Gangnam if you want to enjoy a luxury of city. In addition, there are some parks near Itaewon. For this reason, despite the Itaewon is an entertainment district, the air is quite refreshing.    Second, the entertainment is varied. Diversity is the biggest attraction in Itaewon. Even if you have never been to travel abroad, you can feel the world in Seoul. Embassies from all over the world are located in Itaewon. As a result, there are many traditional restaurants of the world. In particular, the Greek restaurant that is called 'El Grecos' offers traditional Greek food very well, and ‘Gyros’ that I ate in ‘El Grecos’ is the most memorable meal for me. In addition to this, you will also be able to taste the food that you can’t eat often, such as Turkish, Brazilian foods. Besides, there are many traditional costumes as well as food from around the world, so you will be able to easily get unique items. In addition, because the people of various countries are gathered, there are now a wide variety of pubs and bars in Itaewon catering to all tastes.     Third, the atmosphere is different for each area. Near the main street, there are many gorgeous and splendid shops. Especially, I want to recommend ‘the glamping’. In this store, you may be satisfied with the atmosphere in this store. The interior of the restaurant is decorated like a luxurious camping. When you eat the food surrounded by camping supplies, you may feel a sense of freedom as a real camping. And below the main street, there are quiet and secluded stores that are not crowded. Lastly, to the upper direction from the main street, there are charming alleys. There are some unusual and exotic shops hidden in these alleys. Therefore, you can choose to go anywhere depending on your favors. For these reasons, I recommend Itaewon to anyone who want to enjoy feel the global cultures in Seoul."
29,5.0,"brazilian, indian, hot foods,,,,,many world restaurants, cafe, beers in this place.maybe u can enjoy to have a dinner with friends together."
30,3.0,"It's not like the rest of Seoul unfortunately. A lot of the food is westernised, so it's good if you're craving some pub food etc.Many other strips in Seoul with much more authentic look and feel!"
31,3.0,Did not stay in this area for too long and stayed on the main street. We visited this area during the day but I hear the nightlife is great. Some shops line main street and I was pleased to find a New Era Cap shop as well.
32,4.0,"Although we were fully aware that it is the 'international' part of Seoul, we were still overall disappointed.  The 'antique street' was full of British knock offs and the 'fashion street' had little in the way or fashion and many overpriced shops.  The main street was OK and I did get a great jacket made for $300-.  But most of the shops were again of poor quality.  The food street is however, really good and we went back a few times"
33,3.0,"When reading reviews of this place, I expected a bustling area for tourists and many destinations/attractions worth seeing. Unfortunately, my expectations were met with a gloomy and mediocre city that itaewon wasn't supposed to be.Shopping is the repetitive as similar items can be found in almost every store/stall. There were also many counterfeit items being sold but they were extremely overpriced for the quality.Unfortunately, I feel that I wasted my time coming here."
34,4.0,"Great place to see the locals selling western goods and buy cheap souvenirs.  Didn't get to experience the night life here, but can see that it is bustling with everyone from all over the world. Lots of bars and restaurants."
35,2.0,"Did not like this area at all. All the tourists are packed there and it does not feel like ""real"" Soul. The shops were no good and the restaurants seemed overpriced. There are nicer areas to visit in Soul for sure, so this is not worth a visit."
36,4.0,"We liked this area, we went back a few times to eat here. So much food and plenty of shops to see. Food is always great in Asia"
37,3.0,"Itaewon is a very crowded area, with lots of people, shops and restaurants of every kind.If you are staying in Seoul for a long time, then you should definitely visit; if you are staying only for a few days, though, then you can skip it!I wanted to visit the famous ""Homo Hill"" but it was too early and the clubs and pubs were almost empty..."
38,5.0,"Itaewon is a fun area. There are loads of international food choices and different pubs to visit. There are many different clothing stores as well as Korean tailors wanting to sell men suits. Itaewon has a very international feel to it and at times you'll forget you're even in Korea due to the large amount of foreigners in the neighbourhood. Explore the area behind the Hamilton hotel, there are so many cool spots to find."
39,4.0,"Did a little shopping then ended up having dinner at a Mexican Restaurant, Tomatillo, which ended up as a pleasant surprise!!"
40,5.0,We visited Korea and Itaewon in october 2012 and this place is full of life. its one of the most happening places in asia and we really had great time eating out and partying in the hippest area of Seoul.
41,5.0,"Itaewon has got more bars and restaurants than you can visit!  With a bustling nightlife that seems to never stop (I've driven past people staggering out of bars at 5 AM!), and a plethora of authentic international cuisine, Itaewon gives a great change of pace in the heart of Seoul.  Traditional Korean restaurants are great, but, especially if you are a vegetarian, culinary variety is a great thing and that's what you will find in Itaewon.  Be sure to look up (and down!) while you roam the streets; there are hidden gems everywhere!  They really have a skill at using every cm of space available here.  There's quite a bit of shopping to do in Itaewon, too.Word of advice if you are planning to stay in the area... Find a place that you won't mind walking to/from.  There are some pretty steep hills and trekking back up to your room at the end of a long night of eating and drinking can be tough."
42,4.0,"we went to itaewon one evening to check out the offering of bars and restaurants at the bottom of the hill, and what a selection there was! restaurants offering food from around the globe, and there were some very well designed and interesting looks welcoming you in. unfortunately we couldn't try them all out, but if you want a plethora of mid - upper range restaurants, and more on the western side, this is definitely the place to go. there were also several outdoor and rooftop bars where you could relax and have a drink."
43,5.0,"Itaewon is an area that is a must see.  Muslims will go here at least for the Friday prayers as Seouls only mosue is located here.  If you are after seriously good food, exit at No. 3 at Itaewon station.  As you emerge from the underground, a mouth-watering aroma of grilled meat hit you...and you just know its halaal! I do not recall the places name, but on the right to the stairs is a Turkish restaurant. It's small, and quite busy at times, but bide your time.  The wrap ha is sold there is heaven-sent, and the owner is very friendly too.  He speaks english, Turkish, and Korean. It's cost effective and filling, and the cokes are sold at locl prices (not hotel prices).The Area is generally trendy, and you would do well to stroll down the streets and look onto ech of the shops. Don't get caught by insistent shopkeepers for you to come in.  I found that in some cases, if you even just looked in their direction, it was an invitation for them to launch a sales battle on you. If you search for wifi, you can pick up free wifi in some areas. The trade offers clothing, food, shoes, a number of bargain shops and is worth the sore feet and dedicated afternoon in the area. We kept on coming back here for the Turksh wrap...it was that good! Oh, and it's across the street from Baskin Robins."
44,3.0,"We went during the daytime but didn't have high expectations.  Basically it's a 1 km stretch of shops many of which cater to the large foreigner population.  We couldn't find the ""Antique Furniture Area"", but I guess if that is what you are looking for then this is the place to go to.  We did pick up our kitchy souvenir shopping here like Korean chopsticks.  But we went through here fairly quickly.Also a good stop if you are looking for non-Korean food apparently.Only 1 bus stop from the Korean War Memorial.  And on the way to Namsol Hankok Village"
45,4.0,"If you are hankering for something to remind you of home, chances are you'll find it here.  This area has apparently long been popular with expats and the shops and atmosphere reflect that.  Typical street stalls selling clothing, accessories, and bric-a-brac side by side with grander shops and even some familiar fast food outlets.  Most vendors here speak english.  The Metro to Itaewon station takes you right into the heart of this area.  Don't forget to explore the sides stre ets as well"
46,4.0,"This district is lined with international cages and retail stores. You will be surprised to find cuisine from India, turkey and thailand. If you're looking for korean made quality leather products- this is the place to head to. Of course there are counterfeit goods too but most are of good quality ."

48,3.0,"Iteawon is probably the most touristy of all the Seoul shopping districts. It caters to US military personal and their familys as well as forigen tourists from all over the world.  It is of course a gaurentee that anytime you have a large number of tourists in a given area there will always be folks there to rip them off and this district is certinly no exception.However, thats not to say that there are no bargans here because there are indeed some great bargans to be had as well, you just have to be careful who you deal with. I was told by a local who has lived here all of her life that the best way to weed out the crooks is to stay away from the ones who come out onto the street and try to lure you into their shop's with the promise of a fantastic bargan.  The very reputable shop owners who have been there for many years and built up a solid reputation do not have to resort to those tactics, so seek out one of the quiet unassuming little shops where the owner is patiently waiting inside his or her store rather than outside on the street ""barking"" at tourists for the best quality items."
49,3.0,"We had fun partying it up with expats and locals alike at the many bars and nightclubs in this area.  Unfortunately, we also witnessed a number of GI's obnoxiously drunk- two of them were actually in a fist fight in the street.  I could only hang my American head in shame."
