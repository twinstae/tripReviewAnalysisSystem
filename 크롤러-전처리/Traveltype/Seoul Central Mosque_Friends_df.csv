4,5.0,"Never been here before, last time I visited Korea in 2010. Just have a chance now and it is great to visit this place in Korea. Seeing so many people from different countries come to this Masjid to do prayer is beautiful thing, since the location of the masjid is in Itaewon, quite from the office area in Seoul. Must visit place for muslim whenever you come to Korea."
5,5.0,Kinda hard to find for me. Very peaceful place. Lots of restaurants around. Also a great view of the city.
6,4.0,"Near Itaewon station, 10 minutes walk. Outside is peaceful. You get a great view east of Seoul. Inside is tranquil. (Men downstairs and ladies upstairs ) Architecturally not a big thing. But interior with blue mosaic was pretty."
7,4.0,"The ladies' prayer section upstairs is accessible by a long flight of stairs. The mosque and its compound itself were clean and nice. However the road leading to the mosque - with its many halal restaurants and turkish supermarket- was shockingly dirty! Cigarette butts, rubbish, empty boxes/ bottles etc littered the streets in front of the shops and garbage bags were stacked high in the side streets. Compared to the other areas in Seoul this part of Itaewon seemed seedy."
8,5.0,the mousqe is sourrounded by many halal restaurants and Arabic and Islamic stores. the mousqe is on the top of a hill in itewan so the night view of seoul is beautiful from there. women wearing short clothes will be provided long skirts to wear.
9,5.0,One of the best place to visit and get to know the Muslims in this city. Loads of halal eatery to be found surrounding this places!
10,5.0,"The 1 and only Mosque in Seoul, just 10mins from Namdaemun if you are taking taxi.Heaven for Halal Food if you are a muslim, just a walking distance from the Mosque."
11,5.0,"Since I am a Moslem, then this place surely becoming a must-visit place for me in Seoul. This mosque is the one and only mosque in Seoul and since it's SUPER hard to find places to pray for Moslem in Seoul, than this place somehow will bring some happiness for you who crave a proper place to pray. I met many friends here and they're willing to smile and greet you warm-heartedly even you haven't met them before. I also met some tourist visited this Mosque for sightseeing. You can also find many halal restaurant (which quite hard to find in Seoul) as well as stores which sell halal products near this Mosque. This Mosque located in Itaewon which famous for its multicultural surroundings."
12,5.0,"One of the must visit for me here, to see the mosque in the middle of Seoul, a city which Islam is minority. The mosque is big enough."
13,4.0,"The mosque is worth going to. It is located uphill, so might require some effort to go up.  But the view from up is fairly good. While the mosque itself is very different from the typical mosque that you can find in muslim countries, it is also located in Ittaewon area, where lots of stores for shopping is available. Many halal food is also available here."
14,4.0,"Never imagine a Muslim community living in the central of big metropolitan city like Seoul, where a rapid emerging human life with entertainment and popularity become a major aspect in life..Beautiful mosque, a lot of shops providing halal foods, and it is a beautiful scenery overall.."
