0,4.0,"This place is huge, will need some time to see it all. Too many name brands to mention, itâ€™s all there under one roof. Not a cheap place to go shopping but if brands are what you are searching for, look no further."

3,3.0,"Nice modern indoor shopping with a variety of stores and restaurants.  Although prices are high, there is a large bookstore that I enjoy as well as an E-Mart (similar to Wal-Mart) with groceries and the upscale department store Shinsegae.  There are many Asian restaurants along with an On the Border (Mexican chain), Molecole (Italian), and Seven Springs (healthier food with a buffet)."
