0,3.0,"We visited on a Wednesday.  Not too many people, so we were able to move around freely.  As a Senior, I didn’t have to pay for admission.  However, as a senior I found it difficult to relate to the exhibits in a positive way.I understand that at least some of the exhibits “spoke״to younger people."
1,5.0,Great space with 6 exhibition halls to go through. Liked all the exhibits (5) open when I was there. Friendly help by all the staff.
2,4.0,"It was an interesting museum. Though, most of the displays were slightly too dark and/or disturbing. It's a really big museum, with modern spaces. The exhibits and exhibition style was interesting too. Their souvenir shop is pretty cool though."
3,3.0,"It's a big museum but most of the sections are closed or are not opened. There were only 3 areas opened the last time I visited and the entrance fee was $4000 Korean won. There's nothing really much to see, there's also this video showing how 3 women survived during the Korean War, the video itself was boring and the set inside the temporary theatre was really creepy."
4,4.0,"Spent an hour in this museum after touring Gyeongbokgung -- the exhibits are beautiful! Entrance to the museum was free for those under 24 (even for tourists as long as you have your passport), which I think is a great way to encourage the youth to drop by.I think an hour is a bit too short if you really plan to see and take in all the exhibits. But for those with just a little bit of time to spare, it should be enough."
5,4.0,"came to visit during november 2016cost 4000won each person (~SGD $4.80) to view all the exhibitions in MMCAAs MMCA is near to Gwanghwamun palace, you can pop by if you are keen on arts and you can walk over to Anguk later for your lunchThere are digital lockers (free) which we utilized it to store our bags and autumn jackets while we wonder around MMCAit is interesting to see art pieces by the korean artists. looking at art pieces somewhat help to calm my mind and there is a sense of serenity, i do enjoy being there. i will probably return if there is new exhibitionwe spent about almost 2 hours, taking non-flash pictures of the exhibits (:"

7,5.0,Great museum with very large exhibitions of Modern and Contemporary International artists. Great place to see if you like art
8,4.0,"The museum has quite a number of spaces for exhibition, but during my visit almost half of the spaces are closed, so there was not a lot to see. They were having photography exhibition by that time and I'm more interested in painting and sculptures so I was a bit disappointed. But it was still a nice place to go if you do not have much to do and want to relax in the afternoon/to visit on rainy days. I wish there will be more spaces opened next time I visit. Also, there are a lot of galleries near the MMCA, so it can be a good idea to visit the galleries around the area."
9,5.0,"Must visit if you are an art or cultural lover. MMCA is a modern architecture with innovative interior design, which was awarded as ""Architects of the Year"" in Korea, 2014. Also, it is an art, culture & education multi-function complex, consisting of 8 galleries, lecture halls, digital facilities and theater. A wide range of exhibitions have exceeded our expectation, which provided a new art appreciation experience.  You can also enjoy free admission to visit during night opening from 6pm-9pm on Wed/ Sat. Don't miss it!"
10,5.0,"Really awesome, affordable museum to wander about. Many different exhibits and installations happening ~ I really enjoyed the William Kentridge exhibit. The museum itself is very modern and open. We went on a holiday when the museum admission was free for everyone. Even though there were A LOT of people there, it did not feel crowded because of the very large, open spaces."
11,5.0,Didn't even notice when ladies said it's time to close the museum! Spent there whole day without noticing when is it time to eat.  Enjoyed the benefit of free admission for students but had so much fun!
12,4.0,"I love visiting museum when I travel to other countries. National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Seoul is easily accessible ! Just a walking distance from a royal palace called GyeongBukGoong . Nice exhibits and environment !"
13,4.0,"We'd heard great things about this museum and given that it was a short walk from Gyeongbokgung Palace we decided to stop by. Students were free which was a nice surprise, and we loved the interactive exhibits and installations. A really cool museum - would recommend a visit even if you're not typically a fan of contemporary art."
14,5.0,"Not being a great fan of modern art, I was pleasantly surprised at this museum.  The exhibits were varied and interesting.  My visit coincided with an exhibit on an imaginary country, Xijing, which was quite superb, and worth the admission money alone.Even if, like me, contemporary art is not quite your thing, this is well worth seeking out.  As it's near the Bukchon village, this would make an excellent half-day visit."
