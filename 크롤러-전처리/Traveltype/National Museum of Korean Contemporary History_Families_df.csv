0,5.0,"Fantastic, well-located museum. Right next to palace and American embassy. No admission charge, excellent exhibits on Korean history from before the Japanese occupation through the Korean war to the present.  Really well done and informative, with panels in English and Korean. Also a beautiful view from the rooftop garden. Definitely worth a visit for any visitor interested in history - esp. on Monday when so few things are open but really on any day! They also have a children's museum section which we didn't visit, and a caf√© with coffee drinks and baked goods."
1,5.0,This museum is a must do for both Korean and non-Korean people. The turmoil and stress the country has suffered in the last 100 years is sobering to see.Outside influencers and world politics have played a huge part in creating the current divided nation. It certainly gives all the information on how things have developed and can fill you with sadness to see. The striving for a united Korea is something to hope for.Cafe has good food for a break or lunch.
2,5.0,"This is the kind of museum that Seoul had been lacking. Its focus is contemporary history with plenty of visuals. It is nicely divided into 4 sections. It is not heavy on dates and names and there are plenty of pictures and objects. It is reasonably objective but does lean toward ""Through all the struggles and hardship we have endured and flourished because we are Korean"". There is a great children's section that my 3yo loved. It is free, provides free audio and you can print out a free photo. The courtyard on the 8th floor is quiet and offers great views over Gwanghwamun, the palace and Bukhansan. The four main sections took approx 90min to get around, could have stayed longer."
