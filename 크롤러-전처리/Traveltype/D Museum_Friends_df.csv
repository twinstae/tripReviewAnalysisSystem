0,3.0,The museum was really great and I wish I had more time to look around without having to wait on the crowds of people. I went and visited during the weather exhibit. Very interesting and wonderful. Iâ€™d say the customers coming into the museum were 85% female and 15% male (the guys seemed like they were dragged there by the girlfriends). It was a selfie heaven for all the girls so enjoying the actual art itself was a bit distracting with all the sounds of the cameras.
1,5.0,"From what I read on the other reviews I didn't think it was going to be too much to look at, but boy was I wrong!  It was very ""selfie"" friendly and they knew they were coming to a culture that loves to take photos! The vast diversity was wonderful!  I would highly recommend everyone go and see Plastic Fantastic while it is still at the museum but I think it only has a week or so left!"
