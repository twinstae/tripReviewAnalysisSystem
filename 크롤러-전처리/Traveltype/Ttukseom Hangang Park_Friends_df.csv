It's hard to understand a place like this can exist in the busy town of Seoul. You can have a relaxing picnic while admiring the town on the other side of the river."

The area is really peaceful and less crowded compared to other parks and there's also nice cycling track along the river which is really awesome.Park is very easy to reach by train as the station connects directly to the entrance of the park and the place is huge, so you can spend the whole day to explore and have fun at your own pace with a beautiful han river view."
