0,1.0,"I am so regretting what I wrote about this hotel just before. It’s bad for club guest. If you have plan to meet with your guest or friend at the clubhouse, you MUST expect to pay for your guest or friend. Per person $25 even they drink coffee. So don’t be upset if they charged your guest."
1,4.0,"Room was clean, hotel staff were very polite. Hotel was conected to a department store. Very convenient for shopping."
2,5.0,"I was unwell right at the start of my two week's working trip in Seoul. Upon knowing of my condition since 13 Oct 2018, the Club Lounge staff had been very concerned each time they see me, and during breakfasts, would recommend what to drink and eat to better manage the condition of my extreme throat inflammation. Specifically on the 13 Oct 2018 morning, the two Club Lounge staff had helped to find the nearest clinic for me upon request and followed up with me on their own accord an hour later if I was going to the clinic. Another special mention would be the male lobby senior staff who, upon my inquiry of direction, brought me to the clinic for fear I might find it difficult to locate. Very thankful for the concern and dedication of the hotel staff during my visit to Korea this time. Grateful to have made the acquaintance of the hotel staff.  RegardsRoom 3002 Guest (8 to 18 Oct 2018)"
3,5.0,I spend 1 week at the lotte World hotel Jasmine location.The hotel is extremely clean but what makes this hotel stand out is their staff ... one of the best customer service I received ... especially if you meet Rain and Suzie who worked at the executive club... They went above and behind to make my stay an excellent one..also location location location 1 minute walking to the subway...I will defiantly rate this hotel 4.5 stars...Kansameda lotte staff!!
4,3.0,"Lotte is a well-known chain in Korea, and its hotels have a somewhat formulaic uniformity. Lotte World has a rather dated feel and look - it was probably the bees knees twenty or thirty years ago, but doesn't seem to have moved with the times.The staff during my stay were impeccable - polite and efficient, if rather lacking in warmth. My double room was comfortable, functional, and equipped with the sort of items that one needs and expects in a hotel of this level, but faded. The wallpaper and carpet looked as though they should have been changed years ago, and the shower over the bath tub was a Heath-Robinson arrangement. The corridor carpets were equally in need of changing, and the space was pervaded by a musty smell, that may be a legacy of the days when smoking was common in the corridors and rooms.I didn't think much of the dining options: a Chinese place on a high floor (which I didn't try) and a buffet place on the second floor (which I did). The hotel lacks a simple coffee shop type restaurant where one can order a simple dish from a menu.There are plenty of better hotel options in Seoul."
5,5.0,"I have stayed here at least 5-6 times and every time the staff in the hotel, at the club lounge are excellent.Great service, always smiling, positive feelings for guests. The manager and his team are very friendly and helpful. Rooms are nice and quiet with molten brown amenities. Same old nice touch with no reduction in quality - always of a high standard.Breakfast and the evening snacks are superb. High quality food always.Kloud beer bar at the basement is also very nice and not overly priced.Location is super as you have a subway Jamsil station and a super mall beside and the new 123 floor little observation tower.Only gripe is the tax refund people - not part of the hotel - are rude. The young lady needs some training to be more polite to tourists who pay your salary and reason for your job. If you are still rude to such tourists, who are your customers, then you will be out of a job. Be nice. I don’t owe you money and I can return your tax if you feel that you deserve it. I pay high taxes back home too just so you know!"
6,4.0,"Huge shopping center with all brands from all the World ; four floors of shopping and eating , clean and good connect."
7,4.0,Everything you can dream of is there beauty wise with great counters load of staff and good prices. Mix of modern and traditional architecture
8,4.0,Very large shopping mall. You wikl find all you need over there. Especially all the famous international brands
9,4.0,Nice view from top of the tower. Multiple option of restaurant at the top. There is observation deck on chargeable basis to enjoy the view or choose to eat out at any eating place to have a good view
10,5.0,"This is a unique place where you can just spend one whole day here doing everything from having an amusement park, supermarket, shopping complex, food complex, Korean folk village under one roof.  There is also a hotel here, so you can do a quick Korean experience just under one roof."
11,5.0,Nice department store and mostly chain with differwnt brands to buy depending on the money you put !
12,4.0,"Welcome to the world's largest indoor park, a multi-level venture with air balloons, a carousel, roller coasters and an outdoor extension for additional fun. Delight at the off-toned Goofy knock-off as he dances and welcomes visitors with a cavalcade of vaguely familiar but not-quite-right-characters, like a bad case of Deja Vu tinged by excessive soju consumption. There's a bounty of foods available, from sushi to Halal, so you'll never struggle to find an appealing meal. Popular with young Koreans and Chinese tourists, foreign visitors and stressed out families. If you forgot to load up on skincare products out in the Jamsil station/Lotte mall, you'll find your fix inside Lotte world, because what goes better than family fun and consumer goods? There's also tennis shoes, make up, knock-off questionably-licensed Iron Man, Pokemon, Disney characters and more to pick up should you feel spendy! Don't miss the evening show, full of brightly illuminated floats and catchy songs surely to remind you of nights at Disney, weather permitting... Lotte world, at least, is largely spared the concerns of weather."
13,4.0,"The rides are very interesting. Skating rink is at the basement (extra fee). Very long queue for most of the thrill rides, usually about 1hr or more."
14,4.0,When entering from the Mall I thought at first it would be a small console type operation. To my complete surprise it was an amazing experience with a vast amount of rides and amusements where easily you could spend a day. Definitely worth a visit.
15,5.0,It was like I was a kid again when we went here. There were extreme rides to that i really enjoyed it. I will be back here soon!
16,4.0,Probably the biggest theme park in Seoul but extremely crowded. Better to visit in the morning. One of the biggest shopping area in Seoul. You can buy highquality and fancy items in Lotte department store.
17,4.0,It's nice to visit but expensive. I did like to look around and it's walking distance to Gaungum. Try it out.
18,5.0,The best indoor and outdoor  theme park ITS got so much entertainment that even two days is not sufficient. The attractions are so good that you would. Want to repeat them. The whole arena is planned so well that you could see the entire park from any angle. A must visit if in Seoul. They have a special half rate if you go there after 3pm. Very good for business people who do not want to do all the e rides.
19,2.0,All the variety of games were full...and amazing is Korean also can not stay in line. Like chinese people they love to push and going forward to move their line infront.Less staff who can speak English...if you can speak Chinese means your are okay to travel in Korea
20,5.0,"A lot of thrill rides here and strange enough, it was not totally crowded. On a Saturday with beautiful weather, I would expect this place to be packed with people and hours waiting in line, but not at all. It's not a big park and the things are quite close, so not a long walk from one ride to the next. The Lotte shopping complex is just huge and right next to the amusement park."
21,2.0,"If you only have one day stay in Seoul, better skip to visit Lotte World. The playground is as not what I expected. It's probably the same as worse as Genting in Malaysia. It's dirty, plain, and not interesting. It consisted of indoor and outdoor theme parks. Since my visit during winter, it was slightly better experience for me to seeing snow and wandering around just to feel the weather.Overall, better save your time and money to see other worth-it sightseeings. This amusement park ain't no different than Time Zone really."
22,5.0,"Lotte World is unique to me.  Between a very nice hotel, theater, assuagement park, kids indoor play area, and more stores and restaurants than can be counted, there is something for everyone.  It is easy to find since the nearby Lotte Tower (>100 Stories) dominates the skyline in the area."
23,4.0,If you are interested in shopping you must visit this mall as it is probably.the biggest in town.This complex also has the tallest building in the city.Crowds of Chinese tourist come for their shopping.
24,5.0,"It is not a huge one, but a lovely place. I like the parade. It looks awesome.  Pretty much the same or better Disney World's parade."
25,5.0,"It is very good place for indoor amusement park in the winter.  In my opinion, for asian traveler, it is very good eventhough the size is very small compared with Everland because it has indoor and small outdoor zone(=Magic Island). So you don't worry about cold wearher. But if you want to enjoy snow Everland is best. Everland has Snow Sleigh. There are small ice link so you can enjoy ice skating.  :)"
26,5.0,"A Korean answer to Disneyland.it is located near Seoul and can be reached by fast train, bus and even by taxi. A really large complex containing over 30 exciting rides,adventurous activities and extravagant sprawling structures.It has a shop for gifts and souvenirs. A good day activity for all ages"
27,5.0,"Nice room and great location. The hotel is very close to shopping malls and restaurant, and connected to subway. Very helpful staffs."
28,5.0,"Here is a place where you can spend lots of time and enjoy it all. They are a bit cautious about seniors but not restrictive. Great to have the overview ride, and you can determine your level of activities and eating style. Very enjoyable!"
29,4.0,I stays here for 2 days. It is convenient for business meetings and equally good for holiday also. They have a indoor theme park for which entry ticket  is reduced for hotel guests. Next to lotte world tallest building in Korea. Great for duty free shopping for branded products. Also they have lot of dining options for all types of food. Otherwise you can always visit local market dongdemun for great shopping of Korean made products. Staff is courteous and very helpful. Overall a great stay but a bit expensive.
