0,5.0,Right in the heart of Dongdaemun is this piece of of history that you must check out. It's a two minute climb up from near Heunginjimun gate. The view from up here is amazing. For the best experience go up before the sun sets and watch the lights of the city come on from up there.
1,2.0,"We followed the city wall whilst hiking up Inwangson mountain...the viewpoint at the top's great, but in all honesty, the city wall in Seoul looks like it was constructed just last month. The city wall in nearby Suwon is much more impressive."
2,4.0,We could actually see the old seoul walls in many places. Its interesting to see the old city walls. Near namsan park we could see a long part of it.
3,5.0,"Being built in 1396, Hanyang Doseong (Seoul city wall) is the longest wall of its kind in the world and definitely a place you should not miss during your visit in Seoul.Getting there is an easy task. Bus or subway are convenient, especially of the way transfer works in Korea. The stop you have to loom in the stops list is Dongdaemun (동대문 in korean). Our choice was bus and you know you are close when you see the gate on the horizon. But if you come by subway, the exits 9 and 10 gets you right in front of it. For reaching the beginning of the trail of the city wall, you will need to cross the big avenue. You know that you are in the right track when you see an informative sign about the trail.Make sure to wear comfortable clothes and shoes because a long walk is waiting for you ahead and have your camera ready for terrific pictures. At the beginning of the journey, it would seem that someone just put a bunch of rocks in a specific way to build a wall but as you continue going forward (“upwards” describes it better) you will start seeing a magnificent view of the city. If you were wandering, Seoul city wall had a function of safeguarding Hanyang (present Seoul) and demarking the city limits. The Seoul city walls were built in 1396 (617 years ago) during the fourth year of reign of king Taejo and only two years after relocating the capital of the new established Joseon kingdom (1392), taking in special consideration geomantic theory. The wall measures between 5 and 8 meters high and is about 18.6 kilometers long, of which around 70 percent has been restored to its original condition. Incredibly, nowadays it is possible to visit all gates, but it will take you a couple of days. If you have the opportunity go and visit at any location, the Seoul city wall. I really recommend you going near night time so you can enjoy Seoul view during day and night. In my opinion, Seoul has an amazing night view and it is something you wouldn’t like to miss.After a long walk make sure to reward yourself with a good drink in your favorite coffee shop and if you are still with energy after all that walking, you can shop since there are a lot of places to do it nearby Dongdemun. In conclusion, we can list 5 reasons why we should visit Hanyang Doseong:1. Our number one reason to visit Hanyang Doseong is that it is the place where the “old meets the new”. What we mean is that in a modern city like Seoul, finding a place that has so much history behind is something fascinating. And even there is a museum called “Seoul City Wall Museum” where they explain in more detail from its construction until all the efforts made for its renovation and preservation so tourist and citizens can appreciate its beauty.2. Even though it is an historical site, the way it has been remodeled for people visit, makes it a good “escape from the routine” place. Often people are immersed in daily routines and stressed from tiring jobs, for that reason, its well-designed trails makes it an interesting place where you can go for thinking, relaxing and having fun with friends or with your family since it provides all the facilities needed for everyone’s joy.3. Moreover, another important reason of why going there is the “healthy hiking” it provides. What a good way of having a walk and learn from it. It is not an intense hiking so it is suitable for all ages and all that workout with be rewarding by the exceptional views found on many parts of the way. It has many Insta stories places and the night view is spectacular. That is why we hardly encourage you to try both, day and night view and choose your favorite.4. It is not only a walk next to an old wall. It is also a place where other activities besides walking can be done. There, you can find the “Ihwa mural village” where you can eat, refresh with a drink or just enjoy the artistic mural or decorations found in there 5. For us as foreigners, going there and learning about the history behind it, help us “understand a little bit more the Korean culture”. It is part of their historical heritages where you can see and experience in first row 617 years of history from Joseon Dynasty and is still standing strong. Thus, it has the plus value that makes the city more attractive."
4,5.0,"1. The History of South Korea and the People: When you look at this wall and learn the history, it is more than just a wall. It represents hard work, loyalty to country, and strength. The wall was made up of stone, wood and other materials, and the purpose was to protect the city against invaders. The original wall was built in the late 14th century under the Joseon Dynasty and was built in about 98 days by men brought in from different regions. The main materials were constructed of medium-sized stones held together by mud. As time went on and the wall began to break down, different materials were used. It is amazing to be able to walk along the wall and see the different time periods and people that are represented.2. Beautiful Scenery: Seoul is a crazy, busy city. The population of Seoul is roughly 9.7 million. Everywhere you walk and you are surrounded. However, walking along the wall there is so much peace and tranquility. You forget about the hustle of Seoul and you are transported into a paradise of some sort. No noise, no crowds, lots of space.3. Hiking: There are roughly 6 different trails around the city- Baegak Trail, Naksan Trail, Heunginjimun Trail, Namsan Trail, Sungnyemun Trail, & Inwangsan Trail. It would take about 10 hours to walk around the entire thing. It made me think of a good ole Pioneer Trek and is now on my South Korea to do list! If you are an avid hiker, this is not a huge hike, but to be part of a living museum is an amazing experience4. Location: I had originally found out about the wall through a blog I found on Pinterest so I assumed it would be difficult to find, however, because it is so big it was fairly easy to find! Also, a lot of people I spoke with had no idea it was there but once they heard about it they couldn’t help but see it when they went into Seoul. And because of the length, you could probably find different places of the wall to visit! Some parts of the wall are broken down, but you can still be directed to see it.5. Last, but most importantly to preserve the history and dignity of the wall and the people: I asked our tour guide what the people of Seoul thought about preserving and maintaining the wall and she implied that people really weren’t concerned about preserving it. My first point I talked about the dedication of the people, but seriously this is so important to remember. Pat of the wall building process, people would cut their initials into the wall and so people that are able to trace their genealogy back! THAT IS AMAZING! At one point people that were refugees into the city would build their homes on the wall. We need to remember the past, we need to remember where we came from. Most importantly, we need sites like this to see that we all are not very different and we go through similar trials and can come out strong.If you are in Seoul, I HIGHLY encourage you to check out the Seoul City Wall, you will not be disappointed."
5,4.0,"We walked along a section of the city wall in Namsan park, from the top of Namsan down to Myeongdong. The wall is beautiful and interesting, it's inspiring to see the effort that has gone into preservation and reconstruction. Would love to go back to Seoul, see more of the city wall and visit the related museum."
6,5.0,"We walked around half of Seoul's city wall and spent a fantastic day doing so. The only reason we didn't do more, was the fact that my husband wore the wrong shoes.It was a beautifully sunny day and the views over the city were fantastic and we had a lovely lunch along the way. I loved the fact that the you are in the city and immersed in nature and history at the same time. It's not an easy hike as there are plenty of steps up and down the various sections of the wall, but that means its a good work out! The hike is popular with the locals who are all well equipped in full hiking gear. A must do if in Seoul for a few days! I would love to come back and do the full circuit."
7,5.0,"Construction of the stone city wall (Hanyangdoseong) began in 1394, designed to protect the city, much of the wall was built on the ridges of the surrounding mountains, when complete the wall measured 18627 metres long, varying in height from five to eight metres. Today there is only 13370 metres of the wall remaining and a good place for acity hike.  On our first visit to Seoul we did not have the opportunity or know to hike along the City Walls, on our recent return visit to Seoul we made a point of finding an easy accessed section of the wall, this was from Dongdaemun.  Across the road from Heunginjimun Gate is a uphill path to the wall, this path takes you to the City Wall Museum, which was great to visit, and all the way up to Naksan Park where there are views over neighbourhoods.  It is then possible walk further north.  There are other sections of the wall that can be discovered like over near Dongnimmun/ Seodaemun Prison History hall.  Wear comfortable shoes, take water, snacks and sunscreen and have fun."
8,4.0,"Walking the City Wall is a great way to see how modern Seoul is becoming and experience flashes of the past at the same time!  Depending on how much time you have, you can choose a short and easy 1 hour route, or a harder 3.5 hour route.  If you are really short on time, you can walk the four flights of stairs directly up to Naksan Park for some amazing views!We started at Dongdaemun Gate, walked through the Seoul City Wall Museum (free) then continued on to Naksan Park.  It took us about an hour.  Some of the path was steep, but very safe.  The path is paved with cement or concrete unless you are walking immediately next to the wall. Sunset was spectacular!  Don't forget bug spray though because the bugs start swarming as the sun sets.  We have a video that you can find by searching ""Amy Moncure"" for more visuals."
9,4.0,"We spent 2 days covering the wall. It was cold in March when we visited , especially if your are from the tropics, but the walk warmed us up so much we lost the jackets and was down to a base layer plus a hiking shirt for temperatures between 0-5 celcius. The signage could be a bit challenging at times but common sense prevails."
10,5.0,Follow the Seoul city wall trail (aka Hanyangdoseong trail) to get a unique perspective on the city. Seeing the ancient remnants of the wall is interesting in itself.
11,4.0,"The Seoul City wall walk covers the entire 19km stretch around Seoul.At all four main gates you can collect a chop at the little stamphouse. The walk you can do at your own pace, not necessarily all in one day. After collecting all four chops you'll receive a badge to rememver your achievement. The walk brings you to memorable views and city areas around town. At some areas the steps can be a bit steep but definitely worth to take.Best times are autumn and spring to enjoy the views most.The Seoul City wall museum is next to the Dongdaemun gate, a good basis to start the walk with. Don't forget to bring your identification card or passport to access the northern section, north of the Blue House."
12,5.0,"Started at Dongdaemun Gate, you will see the start of the trail across from the Gate. It is well paved and you just follow the wall. It is a hike uphill so wear comfortable shoes. Not too far, you will reach Ihwa Mural Village which will provide plenty of photo opportunities as there are many murals all over the houses in this small village. So if you are only planning to do section of the wall, starting at the Dongdaemun Gate will be good so at least you can see the Ihwa Mural Village along the way."
13,5.0,This is not a wall to be compared to the Great Wall of China.  However you will be able to take some nice pictures at the top of the wall from Namsan Park.  The wall winds itself down from the top of the park.  Following the wall up or down is not for the feint hearted so put your trainers on!
14,4.0,"This is a 18km long walk with some parts which are very steep. You will be able to walk on the trail along the fortress wall, to get a panoramic view of Seoul at some times and even (if you have your password with you) enter in a restrictive zone with guards, cameras and motion detectors (Blue House security)."
