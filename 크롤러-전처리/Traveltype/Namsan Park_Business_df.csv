0,4.0,"N-Seoul Tower is a must visit site if you are visiting Seoul. The tower is open till 10.0 or 11.0 pm for entry. You will witness some breath taking views from the observatory deck, Access to the uphill transfer till the tower is comfortable."
1,5.0,"Nice view of the city which is surrounded by the sea, hilly mountains.Weather was great in coldness i presume below 10c, flower was bloomimgsGood to spend time here with loved ones with the great scenery and cold weather"
2,4.0,This is a good place to walk but be aware that it is all up hill.  Some of my older friends taxi up and walk down.
3,5.0,Get your partner there and she/he will fall in love with you all over again and again and again I promise
4,4.0,"Took the cable car up to the top. Was on a weekday, no queue for it. Once up there a nice view all round the city. The love locks was an interesting find.Good for a visit and to see the changing colors of autumn. Cable car ride is very short but do try it for a spectacular view."
5,5.0,"you must see Seoul from the top of this tower, and you can ride the hanging cart to get a nice experience."
6,4.0,"If you're anywhere near the Namsam Park/Tower, I would highly recommend a visit to the top of the hill/mountain. The place is an easy hike up through various trails, but if you are not up to hiking up (easy and paved steps/trails), then you can take the tram up to the top and walk down. I would imagine, the leaves are turning colors now, which would be nice. I plan to do the hike (which I've done multiple times) when I visit Seoul in a few weeks."
7,4.0,"Walked here in the morning - there is a service road leading from the north east corner (head up behind the Youth Hostel) which contours around the hill and is popular with joggers and walkers. It gives a nice walk in the forest without going too far, and ends at the ground station for the cable car. There are several coffee houses in the streets near the Youth Hostel, so it made a nice early morning walk and breakfast."
8,5.0,I went for a run in the park all the way up to the tower and enjoyed it a lot! There are also many outdoor gyms scattered throughout the park. The history of the old city wall that runs through the park is also very interesting.
9,4.0,April is the spring festival season. The waking route till the n tower is like a heaven. The garden is very well maintained and one of the must visit place
10,4.0,"Breathtaking!   Exhilarating!   Cherry blossoms greeted us along the route to the tower!   Despite an overcast day, visibility of the city was good!   There are also many restaurants and things to do indoors!  This is a site worth visiting!"
11,5.0,"Namsun or Nam mountain, is a must see in Seoul. There are several options to get up there, taxi, bus or cable car. You can go all the way to the top of the tower to have nice dinner, or just to experience amazing view. Namsun is not something that some of other cities don't have, Belgrade also have Avala mountain and Avala tower, but it is about 20 km from city, so the view is nothing special, just woods. But Numsan is totally different you will be amazed by the view, because it is located almost in center of Seoul. Oh yea, you have to use cable car, it will take you to one amazing street, and most crowded street I have ever seen, it is Myeongdong."
12,3.0,Spent an evening here in the winter. Good views of Seoul but bitterly cold! make sure you wrap up warm before you go!
13,5.0,"Good park & tower in the heart of city. Fresh air, nice nature, good food & others. You can relax after seeing the city on a trip"
14,5.0,"The cable car runs every 10 minutes, and is a popular ride to get to the N Seoul Tower. Up top, you'll see the thousands of ""locks of love"" placed by couple on all the fences and ""trees."" Fantastic views, even if cold and windy. Arcades, restaurants and a gift shop as well."
15,5.0,Very worthwhile across the Street from Grand Hyatt walked every day quiet relaxing the fall colours were beautiful was also there last Feb even though winter was still nice amazing city views and history there
16,5.0,"Stayed at the Millennium Hilton my first night in Seoul after flying from the U.S. awoke early and hike to Seoul tower via Namsan Park. Very nice walkway, lighting where needed, and many spectacular views of Seoul as the sun rose. Great Way to take advantage of first-night jet lag!"
17,4.0,"Since I stayed nearby, took a climb up the park. That is 1.5 kilometers up. There are cable car option that you can take. Cost 6000 won one way. At the top is Seoul N Tower. Do take a look at the very colorful love locks on the way down. It adds to the uniqueness of the place."
18,5.0,"Sometimes in clouds and sometimes sunny, the place is like a hill full of trees. Also nice for a walk up or down."
19,5.0,"I would recommend this for anyone fond of trekking. the view of seoul is rewarding. for people that are wary of trekking, there is a cable car to take you to the top."
20,5.0,The hotel we always stay at in Seoul looks out over the Namsam Park.  I love hiking around the woods and trails.  The tower provides an awesome view of the surroundings.  We had an amazingly beautiful day but was a bit hazy so didn't get the usual view.  Can spend as long as you like touring around this place.  They did have a very nice performance playing at the top.  Like Samurai type warrior stuff.  Really nice to watch.
21,4.0,This park is quite beautiful and is a welcome respite from the concrete and busyness of Seoul. This park is on a mountain and is surrounded by forest. It is accessible by walking or by cable car. The view of Seoul from the cable car is wonderful and there are plenty of things to see at the top. I recommend going in the morning because the park fills up quickly on the weekend. It is also best to go on a clear day when the pollution is not too bad. The love locks are fun.
22,5.0,Namsam during Cherry Blossom time was magical. There were various species of cherry blossoms bursting everywhere. The park (on a mountain) is very well designed and a delight to explore.
23,5.0,"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt so the mountain & park was a short walk. I really enjoyed the trails & the views from the top. I didn't use the cable car or tower. My highlights were the old city wall & the Namsan Alpine Club (I accidentally stumbled across this unique ""outdoor gym"" high up on the mountain"
24,4.0,"Got up at 6am to walk up to the Tower.  It is freezing in March so make sure you bring your winter clothes.  It was -2 degrees celsius on this morning and you can reach the top in around 25 to 30 minutes - including photo stops.  The steps can be quite steep so expect to do a few rest stops on the way up.  You get to go through Namsan Park so you can see some monuments on the way, the National Library, Observatory, and if you start at a later time, get a chance to take the cable car.  At dusk you are able to see the city lights and see the sunrise too.  Good exercise, lots of exercise machines in the park too."
25,4.0,I had intended to go downtown but because of political protestors we had to turn around. We were near Namsan and decided to go to the top. What an amazing view from the top of the tower. They were performers at the top and I could have watched their sword act for hours. And make sure to lock your love. Due to the Christmas season it was decorated and lit beautifully.
26,4.0,"We started our walk from The Hyatt hotel, and it was just all up!  Fantastic and lovely walk thru this park. Loved how there were 2 gym areas to do you workouts, lovely clean areas everywhere - this is how ALL of Korea is CLEAN AND TIDY.  Whilst walking we past a lovely small lake which has heaps of 'gold' fish in it - however the lake was frozen - rather funny as we tried to drop stones on it to confirm it was frozen"" ❄️as it was -6"" and we were loving it. There was also a lovely kids playground and some interesting signs around the park.  Then came the huge steep hills, they have steps or ramps to get up them, which I had to do the ramp. (Definitely need shoes with a good grip). Once we finally got to the top we found out that there was a bus that could take you to the top.  I'd recommend this if you couldn't do the walk as it's definitely something that you should see.  From the top we found this incredible view 360"" of Seoul.  We had a lovely cheap lunch - pizza & drink - I was there with my brother & the restaurant took us to an area which was for couples - love seat with an amazing view.  Would've been great if I was with my husband, so we got up & went to another area which was heaps cheaper & perfect for what we needed. When heading into the tower be ready to gave your photo taken & to make a pose. Unfortunately we didn't do it in time so we got a crappie photo. There are shops underneath the tower however most of them went finished being built, only a couple open, so not really worth going into until they're finished.  Enjoy the return walk as it's mostly down hill, we actually went thru a dirt track coming back and it went straight down the side of the mountain - extremely quickly considering it took as about 45 minutes to get to the top and about 20mins to go back down.  If taking the short cut be very careful but definitely worth it."
27,5.0,"Great paved hiking paths to the top of the mountain. Several exercise areas along the paths. Paths lead to Seoul tower with wonderful 360 Views of Seoul and surrounding mountain ranges. May be strenuous, but all ages are hiking. Restaurant and snack area at Seoul tower"
28,5.0,"From downtown Seoul, there is a beautiful path up to Seoul Tower.  I've done this twice now, the first time by myself, and I believe it would be difficult to get lost.  Just head up towards Seoul Tower, and eventually there will be signs leading you up the path.  There are a ton of stairs, but it's peaceful, beautiful, and very friendly.  The view from the top is great, but it's all about the journey.  I highly recommend following the path up."
29,3.0,"This Namsan Park can be reach by using the cable car from the city.  Where we get off near the namsan tower.  We can see good view while we are going up by the cable car.  Soon when we arrive we can find some Cafe, Restaurant, Souvenir Shop.  Before we can see all the restaurant, shop, etc, we should climb up Steps.."
30,4.0,"Located close to old downtown, there is a good and nice ride with the cable car to teach Namsan tower top. Good views and a nice restaurant."
31,4.0,"Tend to be crowded with tourists and locals alike. However the reason to that is that the cherry blossoms there are really nice, and if you have time to take a walk, it is utterly romantic and you are able to get a view of the city below."
32,5.0,"It's must see location if you are visiting Seoul. Perfect view of the city and its surroundings. Good to visit during the day and at night. Many interesting things to do,  perfect pictures opportunity."
33,5.0,"The park is crowded at all times of the day, every day of the week.  But, it's so beautiful and the trails, streets are just a nice place to walk and hike.  During the summer, you have to get out very early because it's so hot.  But during the winter, it's so nice to go for a walk around 4:30am to have a quite beautiful walk!  It's clean, and very nice.  The cable car is an option for anyone who does not want to walk up.  There are shops and restaurants on the top, that are fun to browse or eat at!"
34,4.0,Not only is it a cool way to get up to the tower but you don't have to do the 30 min uphill walk if you are in a rush to get around and see this incredibly big city. The ticket you but for the tram IS NOT a ticket to get to the top of the tower. You must purchase another pass at the top. The views even if not going up to the top of the tower are still remarkable
35,3.0,"I rode the cable car to the top, expecting beautiful scenery and hiking trails. Instead I found hordes of tourists posing for selfies, eating, and buying souvenirs and love locks. There were good city views. Although I had bought a RT ticket, I walked back down. There was a lot of construction and it wasn't very pretty, except for a few statues.  Not a highlight :-("
36,5.0,"What is so amazing is that this beautiful park is in the middle of a concrete and steel city. Walking in the park (like walking in Central park in NYC) you do not realize you are in a large, busy, international city. It's a lovely experience."
37,3.0,Traveled there in the autumn and enjoyed the beautiful colors. Not much else to do. Skip the car that goes up and simply enjoy the view walking around if your hotel is near; otherwise skip altogether.
38,3.0,"It has a nice view, a trick eye museum, a restaurant, and a cafe in the tower. The price was really affordable, it worth a trip while here."
39,5.0,"Nice oasis of tranquility in the busy Seoul.  Nice climb with an amazing view from the top.  For those who can't climb, there is a cable car that will bring you to the top, and, I think, some buses are available. When I say climb, it's not rock climbing.  On top of the trails in the woods, there is the road that you can walk up."
40,4.0,"Very interesting place. You can see how huge Seoul is from this tower. Not so many activities up there, I think just shopping souvenirs."
41,5.0,Beautiful scenery of entire city of Seoul can be viewed from Namsan mountain and the TV tower on top of it.You can go up using the cablecal or by foot. Recommended: go there afternoon and beginning of the night to see the city lights.
42,5.0,"I enjoyed wandering around. We found our own route up on small deserted footpaths which was very pleasant. The top is a bit hectic, but part of the experience. You can appreciate just how massive Seoul is stretching up the valleys on every side."
43,4.0,"Very good complete view of the whole city.Must visit while in seoul in the night time especially. Love the infrastructure, main tower & lock trees were hilarious."
44,3.0,"I signed up for an hike organized by the COEX Intercontinental Hotel concierge staff to explore Namsan Park. On April 19, we caught the very tail end of the cherry blossom season, and the wildflowers were in full bloom.  The weather was cool and humid, and the walk was a good distance for me (approx. 3 miles up and back, since we started at the park entrance. Some tours drove to the top but our excursion was labeled a ""hike"" and hike we did!) There is some serious elevation gain, either by the stairs (which is more directly UP) or by the road which winds around but still is on the upward slant. At the top, we walked into a spring festival in full swing. We ended up not going into the radio tower, as the view from the top of the public access was quite nice in and of itself. At the top you'll find love locks all around, in the shape of trees and along the guard rail of the top deck area. Suggest you wear comfortable shoes (amazing to see many folks walking up in high heels, and full on Sunday duds - stockings, 3 piece suits etc!) You'll generate a sweat, even in cool weather, so dress appropriately! Even from where the busses might drop you off (if you're on a bus tour) it's a steep 100 meters or so up to the top of the hill.All in all it was a good hike, and a nice scenic view at the top. A nice way to get a vista of the entire area."
45,4.0,"I took a train into Seoul station. From there I took bus route 03. This bus can be found outside exit 10 of the metro station but any stop showing route 03 would work. From there it was about 15 stops until the top of the lookout. Maybe 1/4 mile from the tower. Really 30 minutes at the top was more than enough for me. Only tour buses and this city bus can get to this part of the park. The lift would have been neat but the bus was easy and quick.  If I knew then what I know now. I'd have walked down the hill in the direction that all the buses take. I'd have enjoyed the park and continued to the Namsan Public Library. it looked to have a very pretty garden in front of it. Route 03 has a stop at the library. From there (or the top) $1 gets you back to the station. This time a short ride, only 5 stops."
46,5.0,If you come to Seoul you HAVE to take a trip to Namsan tower. You can see the entire city from this viewpoint. You can ride a cable car up to the top or walk but it is definitely a walk. Also pay a ticket to go to the top of the actual tower. It is worth it.
47,5.0,2 options of following the concrete road or natural trail. Suit your style and mood. Must do the entire length and enjoy some great views on the sides.
48,5.0,This tower is a great place to visit at night. Located on the highest hill in Seoul you get a 360 degree look at the lights of the city. Steep incline to climb and descend going and leaving the tower but worth the effort.
49,4.0,I stayed at the Hilton directly across from the park. It was a great walk in the morning through the park and up to the Seoul tower.
50,4.0,"Namsan Park has many years of history and it is one of place you can look down Seoul good.The Namsan tower is a replica of Toronto CN tower and indeed there is a rotating restaurant with a great view.Namsan park has very long walking trail and you can literally spend a whole day exploring different side of Namsan (tower and immediate area, to Namdaemoon and Namdaemoon market, National theater area with Jangchoong dong, and hotel Shilla area).  There are many eateries and shopping you can do from duty free to cheap market street food.Highly recommend for new visitors in fair weather days."
51,4.0,"Liked the ways to make your way to the top.Walk up, bus up, or take a tram. Best on a clear day. You can eat at the rotating tower at the top of the mountain. Gorgeous in the fall."
52,4.0,"Was told to go here in the evening, but I think it is better to go in the daylight so you can see and enjoy the views.  I took the cable car up since it was pretty cheap less than $10 round trip and I went in the evening.  There is also a local bus that will take you there for cheap. There are some really good views of the city.  Not really sure why but there seems to be a thing about buying locks as symbols of love and affixing it to the railing, walls, and anything else. Everyone is doing it. I would not go to the N Seoul Tower as the price to go up is very high and did not seem to be a value for the cost. Lines can be long but they move really quickly."
53,4.0,"Walked into the street accidentally while looking for Namasangol Village. Nice neighbourhood with design houses. What an uphill climb! At the end of it, found out from the police in a patrol car I was in the wrong place. They kindly gave me a lift to the village in the next street. Very sweet senior patrolman!"
54,4.0,The park by itself is beautifull and for peace off mind i would definitley reccomend this one.Go all the way  or just take a small stroll around
55,5.0,"It's a great place to walk, hike, and run with all ages.  History and nature combined into a wonderful setting for all ages.  The walk to Namsan Tower is fun, and the views of all of Seoul are amazing."
56,4.0,"Take a walk around this lovely park to stretch the legs and clear the head. Catch the cable car to N Seoul Tower and walk back down, or walk all the way up if you're feeling fit. Interesting cultural landmarks with informative signs and great views of Seoul."
57,4.0,"A steep hill with good view of the city (on a clear day/night).  It's a great spot to escape from the hustle and noise of Seoul and enjoy the sound of the birds - if you're quiet you might spot a squirrel.For those not keen on the walk (which has lots of stairs if you approach from the North), there is a cable car.   Very popular with locals (especially on a summer evening)."
58,5.0,Visit this park and the Seoul Tower in the Namsan Park. You will have a mind blowing view over Seoul and the park is beautiful.
59,4.0,"A good place to go, if you just want to chill on top of it. Make sure it's not a foggy place. You can op to visit the teddy bear museum on top of the Seoul Tower."
60,4.0,Packed into a cable car and taken the short journey to the top .... great views of the huge city of Seoul. Padlock city up there ..... lovers and couples putting padlocks on the fence for good luck.
61,5.0,"Great walking , I missed the cherry blossoms by about 2 weeks, some were still in flower and I could imagine it's stunning park when they are in full bloom"
62,4.0,"if you visit seoul, you should see Namsan Park. Especially in spring. I have visited there second week of april and it was wonderfull. You can climb to Seoul Tower and see the best wiev of Seoul from here."
63,5.0,The trip up the hill is good for fitness. Many vista points with good views for Seoul. Once the trip is complete the area surrounding the Seoul tower is full of life and good scenery.
64,5.0,Namsan tower is about 1-1.5 kilometers away from Seoul subway station. It would take about 45 min - 1 hour to trek all the way up from Subway station to the top of namsan tower. Observatory is very good. Worth a watch.
65,4.0,"Go early, take the cable car up to the top and then go up in the observation tower.  The walk down is easy."
66,3.0,Plan ahead for this excursion and go early. We waited in line for at least an hour to take the tram to the top and when you arrive at the top you have to walk up a long set of stairs. This was after making a hike just to get to the tram station! Then you get to the park.  There is also another building you can visit but it costs extra and that felt like a rip off! Not suitable for elder folks or people who cannot walk up hills
67,5.0,One of the great place to visit and see in Seoul! A must for the family! There's also some great cultural shows there!
68,4.0,"Our visit was the first week of December, the temps were in the 50's so was a pleasant surprise.  Being from Minnesota, USA this was unbelievably warm for December.  The view from the tower sadly was poor, the smog, pollution or just the low overcast made the viewing a disappointment.  Tried a soft serve ice cream cone when we came down.  What a mistake.  No one told me until after I got food poisoning to not eat the dairy products in Korea since they do NOT pasteurize. I was sick for 12 hours after we got back to the hotel.  The cable car was a nice experience and was the friendly Koreans we met."
69,5.0,This park is like Central Park in NYC but is really a huge hill and former fortress from earlier times. The best place to get away from the hectic pace of a vibrant city.
70,5.0,The park has a highest building in Seoul (a Namsan tower - 236m). This tower is situated on the Namsan mountain. The park is a very beautiful place with a lot of bloomy trees especially cherry trees. When you walk through the park the petals of the cherry trees are on the ground like the snowflakes It looks like wonderful
71,5.0,Wonderful place to be to get some amazing views of the city on a clear day and watch a wonderful sunset..
72,4.0,"If you want to walk up a hill and experience some relative quiet and surround yourself by greenery, this is the place. You can also observe Koreans relaxing and having fun."
73,4.0,"I'll start of by saying I've been through Seoul more than a half dozen times. I've done everything on the standard tourist attraction list and many off the beaten path. This is by far my favorite place to go when I'm in town. I always find myself going for morning or late afternoon walks. When it's warm I'll even bring a book. It's not that it's a spectacularly amazing place to see, but rather just a nice and relaxing place to unwind a bit.If you don't find parks enjoyable or don't like walking then perhaps you should just make straight for the Seoul Tower to knock it off your list.It's places like this that make me feel I'm really in a new place and are the most memorable to me. If you're feeling blue or bored I highly recommend just taking a deep breath and giving this park a stroll or two."
74,4.0,"Since going to this park is essentially trekking up to Namsan, and the elevation is quite steep, it really is a great workout for your legs, thighs and bum. When you reach the higher areas, the views are amazing. You have a great view of Seoul, especially from sunset to evening when the city lights up. There is also a portion of the city wall that is preserved here, which also gives you a glimpse of history. The park is huge so you don't expect much people, especially during weekdays."
