0,4.0,"Huge mall near Yeongdeungpo Station (Line 1).  Signage to get from the Station to the Mall is a little tricky - Aim first for the Yeongdeungpo Underground Shopping Mall, then the entrance for Times Square Mall is a a couple of hundred meters along on the left hand side.  You enter the mall at gate 10.  The mall itself has everything - department store, supermarket (HUGE!), premium brand apparel, jewelry, sports, etc. reasonably well organised.  Lots of coffee shops, eateries and restaurants, as well as cinemas and entertainment zones. Good place to spend the afternoon, especially if the weather outside is inclement."
1,4.0,There’s a Shinsegae store and the usual cast of mall shops in the Times Square proper but i found some neat shops in the large underground shopping complex. There’s several dining areas with a great variety of restaurants as well. You can get here on metro line 5 and walk to the mall using the underpasses and underground shopping passages. Good for getting some walking in on a cold windy weekend day.

4,4.0,Went to Times Square Mall in Yeongdeungpo a couple of times during this trip to Seoul. Times Square Mall took me less than 10 mins walk from Yeongdeungpo Subway Station (Blue Line).

6,4.0,I like shopping at Times Square Mall because it is not as busy or crowded than shops in Myeongdong. I enjoy much quieter and better quality shopping at Times Square Mall.
7,3.0,"Read about this new largest mall in Seoul, so decided to check it out.  It took about 25 minutes by Korea Rail/Metro to get there from City Hall station.  It's main anchor tenant is Shisegae and that is the first building you notice across the road when you step out of the Yeongdeungpo station.  It is not directly connected (at least I could not find the underground link) so it might be difficult to get to and from the station when it rains.It also has a large ecopark whe you can sit in fine weather to have a quick lunch.  I loved the huge Emart store spread across two floors in the basement, which sells everything from groceries and beers to car accessories and home linens, and everything in between it seems.  There are also the usual brand names you can find in any mall, such as LV and Coach, as well as high street stores like Charles & Keith and H&M.  If you are hungry, you can have Mexican food at South of the border, burgers from Lotteria and KFC, Japanese ramen and Viet noodles, and many more.I enjoyed visiting the pet and flower shops at the end close to Emart, where there were several puppies for sale.  As mentioned before, it is quite a distance from town, but you can make a day of it by exploring the streets of Yeongdeungpo anto see how the locals go about their daily routines."
8,5.0,I really love this mall because it is not so crowded during weekday and I could easily spent more than 3 hours there shopping and eating with a lot of personal space and avoided the noisy tourists crowds!
