1,5.0,I was staying at Courtyard Timesquare and it was easy to go to timesquare mall because literally it is just right next to the hotel. it is one of the biggest mall in Korea and you can enjoy shopping and have different franchise eateries. 코트야드메리어트에서 숙박하면서 쇼핑하면서 놀고먹기 좋은곳. 정말 바로 옆에 붙어 있기 때문에 이동하기가 편리하다. 여러가지 프랜차이즈 음식점들도 입점해있어서 쇼핑과 식사를 해결하기에 좋은곳

3,3.0,"Took subway direct from Euljiro 1 station to Mullae station & walk about 10 mins from Exit 4. A huge xmas tree outside the mall with a little red car display, pretty to take photo. Glad that we came from Mullae station else could have missed this nice photo stop :)Many shops including Kaokao Friend store, sports shops, ladies boutique, restaurants etc but it's a pity E mart is closed. Glad to find my sport shoe size here as it's sold out in Myeongdong & Express Bus Terminal underground shopping.The mall basement is link to Yeongdeungpo underground shopping & link to Yeongdeungpo station.Had Korean dumpling & noodle lunch before head to next destination. Spend about 3 hrs including lunch. Nice place to relax."

6,4.0,"Times Square is one gigantic mall. It’s a good place for you to stroll around if you want to get away from the heat of the sun especially in summer. It has a lot of shops ranging from average to even high-end ones. Moreover, you will also not get hungry in this mall because there are a lot of restaurants and cafes to choose from. Also, their food court has a good range of food to choose from which caters to customers who are on a budget. So don’t be afraid to come into this mall because they have affordable picks to choose from. And speaking of affordable picks, Time Square is also connected to E-Mart which is one of the biggest supermarkets in the country. This is the perfect place  for you to go gift shopping on snacks and food because they sell them in affordable prices, they also have wholesale items which means cheaper price too, and they often have items on promotion like buy 1 take 1 items."

Leave the station through lotte department store and cross the street and walk straight for another 200m, turn left and walk for about 150m to arrive at times square."
