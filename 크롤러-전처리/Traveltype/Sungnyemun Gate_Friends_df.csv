0,4.0,Bus passed here and it looked like a really interesting place to go. It's located on the Western entrance of the Namdaemun Market. The gate looked really nice.
1,4.0,"Landed up here by accident looking for the market , the Guardâ€™s are really helpful and in full attire. Quite cool for a few pictures with them but not worth a special trip."
2,4.0,"Known as one of the main gate of Seoul, this historical site is a good place to know more about the Korea. The main attraction for me is the traditional Joseon guards who guard this gate. It will be really attractive when they change the shift in a small traditional ceremony."
3,4.0,Located across from Namdeamun Market. You can either walk across the street or there is an underground path way to Sungnyemun Gate. It free to get. There are a brief descriptions carved into the stone about this place. It is worth seeing and learning the histories of Seoul.
4,4.0,"This impressive Gate is in fact the No.1 Historical Monument in Seoul.Note that the actual gate is closed on Mondays, but it is still possible to absorb the grandeur at any time day or night, when it is lit up. Very photogenic."
5,3.0,"If you are on a trip for history and culture, stop by for 5-10 minutes to say you were here. It sits on a busy corner and there is nothing to do here but look at the monument and take a picture. Once you know the history- it's interesting."
6,5.0,A part of history in the middle of the city. It's been really cool to find these gates around soul. It's a part of history you can find right in the middle of different parts of Seoul!
7,4.0,"A great ancient monument that has been restored to remind us of how grand and great the gates to the city looked long ago. It is st the western end of the namdaemun street market. Although not very big, it is very grand. The gates are closed on mondays and on other days at 6 or 630 depending on the season. It looks grand by day and simply impressive at night.Tip: see it in late afternoon before u walk the mkts and captured it in the early evening when the lights come on for good photo opportunity."
8,5.0,"Obviously there isn't too much to do. Just take a couple pictures and that's it. But it looks amazing. Magnificent view, the ancient gate in the middle of the whole modern city. Is really worth a view and couple pics."
9,4.0,We stayed near this place so we visited many occasions. This is situated right across the Namdaemun Market. Beautiful architecture. Entrance is free.If you are passing this area worth a visit
10,5.0,It's amazing and powerful and great to check out after it was restored. A terrible fire caused by a crazy guy burned it down years ago but now it's nice and beautiful. Tourist can easily go and visit and you will learn so much about Korea and the history of Seoul. I think you should visit around 4pm. The evening sun falls beautifully at the wall. A must go
11,5.0,"It is a very good place, a must, any you should have a photo in your library and share it. This place says 'you are in Korea'. Also I recommend a little reading of its history. You won't spend more than 20' there."
12,2.0,"Not the most interesting attraction in Seoul. Once you've looked at it for a minute, there's nothing else to see in the surrounding area and it's very similar to the other gates which are situated all over Seoul"
13,4.0,It's a symbol gate of Namdaemun area! You should take photos here! It was worth walking in daytime or nighttime but at night you can have a very pretty picture here cos the light makes it more interesting & stunning!
14,3.0,nice place to take picture. but is it merely a gate. but the structural design is great and it is located in the main street
