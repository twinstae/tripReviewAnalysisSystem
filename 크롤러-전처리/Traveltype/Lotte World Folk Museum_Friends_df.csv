0,5.0,"Came to Lotte World for the rides and attractions - didn't even give the Folk Museum a passing thought until my dad mentioned that it was included in our admission ticket. We decided to drop by to have a look around (had no idea what to expect) but it turns out that this museum is an intricately curated collection of both life-sized and miniature models and displays of Korean life throughout the ages. There were moving ""robots"" showing how life was in the olden times (Joseon and Silla dynasty etc) and also replicas of how a typical home would look like in those days - all the way up to the Japanese colonial period. There are even interactive aspects of the visit as they let you try simple and traditional mock-up Korean games. The most impressive part was probably the cavernous room filled with miniature displays of a typical day at the Palace or village.The careful attention to detail was amazing and I could definitely feel that lots of thought and effort went into preparing the exhibitions. It was quite empty when we visited - think this place is a hidden gem and is not to be missed!"

You know when you are a kid (for generations before the internet age becomes mainstream) u can have just 2 small action figures and play all day with your imagination? well, when i was at this place, my imagination comes alive. I can imagine these small dudes moving. For those who cant imagine, you can appreciate the art of making the small people. It just so cool"
3,3.0,Just like any other museum. Nothing spectacular about it. But because we got the Lotte World park ticket and this was inclusive hence we went for it.
4,5.0,"It was so beautifully curated and I was blown away by the efforts put into the miniature models. I ended up spending 2 hours in the museum... longer than I did queuing for the outdoor rides. I give it a 10/10 and recommend it wholeheartedly. To thoroughly enjoy the experience, I would suggest visitors go check out the actual Gyeongbokgung Palace first so that they will be better able to appreciate the models in perspective. An A* attraction."
