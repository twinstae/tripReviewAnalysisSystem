NO, they don't treat tourists the same but I understand why. This fish market is for locals and they are looking to make money and not entertain. So bring the cash and enjoy an amazing fresh seafood dinner. After you haggle them for the price, they will take it upstairs to the restaurant which they work with and you simple just let them know how you want your meal cooked. That's it.I was so blessed that night with meeting the most amazing Korean's at the table sitting next to me. The night turned out to be a huge 3 hour party. Good Times..."
