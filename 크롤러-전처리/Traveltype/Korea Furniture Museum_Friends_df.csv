0,5.0,"If you are in South Korea you might have noticed that this is a country that really knows how to preserve the past on the streets of Seoul city. The Korea furniture museum is no exception even though this attraction is a little bit far from the metropolitan area of Seoul. Here you are going to make it not just to learn about the history and different uses that items of furniture used to have in the old times but also, you are going to feel how you can travel to the past by looking at the wonderful Korean architecture style in their houses and gardens. Every detail in the gardens and the inner part of the houses has been meticulously placed to make the guests feel the harmony and balance between nature and Korean architecture. After living in South Korea for three years I never heard about this place before and none of my Korean friends talked to me about it. I'm going to dare to say that this is is a hidden jewel in Seoul. The guide has really good English skills and everything he said was didactic at all time. I think that despite the long distance from the metropolitan area of Seoul to the Museum this is a must visit if you appreciate the Korean architecture style, and remember, that you must do an online reservation in advance to visit the museum."

There are stories to go with each piece of furniture and each room of the carefully reconstructed and rebuilt historic houses. A fascinating place to see how Korea envisions its traditional past — and a peaceful place to dwell for a couple of hours."
2,5.0,"Stunning examples of traditional Korean architecture in a truly lovely setting. The grounds are peaceful and I felt like I was transported to another era. The furniture collection itself is quite small, though still interesting and indicative of traditional Korean life. It's not the easiest to get to, but is well worth a visit for history lovers (Gilsangsa temple is also nearby)."
3,4.0,My Korean flight brought me there as it was the place that the First Lady of China visited when Xi JinPing visited Korea. The place is amazing because i never knew furniture could be so interesting.  Our English guide spoke perfect Engllsh and told stories of ancient Korea through furniture and the way of life.  The setting is beautiful and the korean style ancient architecture is so simple and beautiful.   Even my Korean friend said he learnt a lot from the guide.  It is definitely worth a visit.
4,3.0,"This museum has potential but I felt like I wanted more. The collection of ancient furniture was surprisingly small; our guide mentioned that most furniture were destroyed when their owner died which would have been a reason why the collection wasn't large. However, the collection itself was beautiful and the guide gave detailed history of what the different furniture were for, how they differ from each period, the symbolic way a furniture was made, etc. I also enjoyed the rooms of the 'lord and lady' of the house; as it gives us a chance to see how furniture were made with the human functionality in a room in mind.The location of the museum, while in itself was at a beautiful location (up a hill away from the bustling city. It was quite difficult to get to without a taxi.Overall I enjoyed it but I believe that the museum has the potential to become something more. At this stage, as another reviewer stated- this is a one-time visit."
