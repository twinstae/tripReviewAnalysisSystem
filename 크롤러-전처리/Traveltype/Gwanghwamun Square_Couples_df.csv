0,4.0,The square is large with 2 huge statues of Korea's historical figures. And in the background you can see the mountain and the palace.
1,1.0,"There is a fringe political group holding protests in the area - every weekend apparently - they wear earplugs and shout through very loud speakers, block the way and harangue tourists. I would advise staying away until these folks shuffle off."
2,4.0,"This is a very formal and grand public square in honour of the well loved Emperor Sejong.There is a museum in the basement (free admissions) which is below the statute of the Emperor. Look for the interesting displays on the history of Korea, Hangeul language and the lifestyle of the early days.You could watch a short movie, which is very informative, in this small museum.Back to the Gwanghwamun Square, there are many spots for nice photos."
3,3.0,"An imposing square -- with a Joceon Palace to the north and statues of King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sun Shin adorning the median. Obviously not worth a trip, but when in the area it makes for a lovely stroll (as long as there are not more anti-American demonstrations along the way, since this is also the site of the US Embassy)."
4,4.0,Absolutely loved the mountains in the background and to see the palace in the distance. The statue is very well made. At the sides of the square is a floor plaque for each year with something written next to it (wasn’t in English so unsure what it said but I found it really intriguing). I loved the buildings and really feeling like you were in Seoul.
5,3.0,The statute is massive and situated right in front of the palace entrance so it can’t be missed. We went early and managed to avoid the crowds.
6,3.0,Wind blowing will make your face frozen when walking in this square. King Sejong's underground memorial/museum can be your savior to escape the winter cold. Nice to walk in this square until you reach Gyeongbokgung Palace.
7,4.0,"Visited Gwanghwamun Square to take photos of the King Sejong statue. When I arrived at the statue, I found that there's a museum dedicated to the king down under the statue. Admission into the museum is free and there's no crowd at all. Worth visiting."
8,3.0,"Gwanghwamun is not really a square but a large rectangle in the center of Seoul, directy in front of Gyeonbokgung Palace. There are two famous statues in the middle of the square which divides the highway in two. Many tall buildings are on each side of the street."
9,5.0,"I much preferred our recent visit to Gwanghwamun Square than in the past, it was full of atmosphere with a local community fair in progress as well as a large memorial to a recent disaster in Korean to view and ponder, it certainly was a busy public square.  Also there are two fabulous statues of great Korean people, Admiral Yi Sun-Shin and King Sejong who have left their mark on Korean society and culture, check out the fun water fountain, most likely enjoyed more in warmer months.  At the far end of the square, away of from the business centre, is Bukaksan Mountain in the distance with Gyeongbokgung Palace in the foreground. There is no shade on the square so sun protection is required and recommend a good pair of walking shoes for an enjoyable day out in Seoul."
10,4.0,When we were there this year the square was set up for viewing of World Cup matches so there were many tents round the statue of King Sejong the most revered monarch in Korean history who created the Hangul. We had a nice wander around and saw the statue of Admiral Yi where there was a mountain. There was a moving memorial exhibition about the Sewol ferry disaster where bodies of a number of people have still not been found and families are still waiting for an investigation to be done and those responsible held to account. The square is really impressive esp as you walk towards Gyeongbokgung and the mountains behind it. A must visit site when in Seoul - easily accessible to Cheonggyecheon and other sights.
11,5.0,Nice place to walk around and see thing a lot people here they hangout and do a lot of different thing ! A lot a shop and coffee shop also!! Beautiful view of the mountains too and very clean!!! And very safe!! I will be there in June 5 2018
12,5.0,This area in the front of  the Gyeongbokgung palace is  a very nice place to be. It is a great area which give you several connections to other nice places. The big staties remind to the history of Korea. You can free walk in the middle of this grand street
13,4.0,"It was a very impressive square. The area was huge and there was Gyeongbokgung Palace and Bukhansan National Park in the background. The square contained imposing statues of Admiral Yi Sun-sin, a military leader and King Sejong the Great of Joseon, the creator of the Korean alphabet. As we walked towards the statues we passed a memorial for the victims of the 2014 MV Sewol ferry disaster, most of whom were students. There was a tent set up with information and it seemed that the families of the victims were still searching for answers. It really pulled at the heart strings."
14,5.0,This city square highlights the best of Seoul. A touch of history at one end mixed with the modern day hi tech world. As you walk from the LED screen billboards towards the Palace grounds. You can see many historical statues and city buildings. Try to get up to the palace gates prior to 10am to see the changing of the guard ceremony.
15,4.0,"Be there before 8am to avoid the crowd, it is different to walk in a wide street without anyone around you. Great opportunity for photograph. Enter the palace and watch guard changing shift at 10am."
16,4.0,It is a nice square to walk to the Gyeongbokgung Palace and Gwanghwamun Gate. Make sure to check out the US embassy to the right
17,2.0,"Gwanghwamun square is in front of the Gyeongbokgung Palace.  If you visit the palace, you will see the square.  Otherwise there is no need to just come to see it.During our stay, there are some activities in this area: booths for remembering the victims of the ferry accident,  concert, choir performance and protests.  Since English is not always used by Korean, most of the time we had no clue of the nature of the events."
18,4.0,"We visited here after visiting Gyeongbokgung palace. The police were having come sort of exhibition here.  Lots of tourists here. There was even a stall where you could rent korean costumes. You can find statues of Admiral Yi Sunshin and King Sejong here. Lots of young people hanging around, even on a hot sunny day.  The square is free to visit."
19,5.0,"It is in the city center, big, spacious, behind you will see Gyeongbokgung Palace and Bukaksan Mountain, of course if it is not rainy day."
20,5.0,Not everything is as at seems.  The statue is only a top of the iceberg.  Under the statue is entrance to a large museum area that I recommend visiting.  It is very interesting to read about King Sejong and also to learn about the battles at sea with the Japanese navy in ancient times.  Highly recommend it.
21,4.0,"It's one of the good places to take photos at in the city. Especially to budget travelers, no entrance fees needed."
22,4.0,You can see the square and walk along it when you exit the subway station on the way to the big palace.
23,5.0,"I walked from city hall heading North then found the 1st person is Admiral, Yi Sun Shin( I saw movie about him before I came here). Keep heading North, The 2nd person is King Sejong. We found history of them in Memorial of War Museum (free of charge)."
24,3.0,Just a huge square with some historical statues. A pass by location before visiting the Palace. Note that at the east side there's the US Embassy with heavy security.
25,4.0,"It's just a big open square but you get to see statues of significant leaders from historical Korea and have a good view of Gwanghwamum. It is a central place with other shopping places, attractions and museums around."
26,3.0,"Just for the Square it might not be worth a visit, except there are some special happenings on the square. Or when there is special illumination at night.But if you link it with your visit to the Palace and / or Insadong then it's surely worth a look.It's a really massive Square. With the statue of the Admiral Yi Sun-sin a bit to the south and the Statue of King Sejong sitting prominently in the middle of the square, greeting all the visitors. Talking about visitors: There were surprisingly few on the weekday afternoon. Which was good for the photos. And there are quite some photo ops, especially with the King Statue and / or the Palace in the back.Underneath the Square there is a small exhibition hall and museum about the two historical figures depicted the statues.And on the east side there's also the US Embassy with massive security.So, in the end it's just a square, there's not much to do. But come have a look anyways before or after visiting the Palace.Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile."
27,4.0,"Gwanghwamun Gate seems to be the main and largest gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace, one of five palaces those are must-see spots for your first visit in Seoul. we walked along the Centre stream, then reached  Gwanghwamun square. there was a flee market in the square which opened in the weekend only. we also visited an underground museum of a Korean King (not remember the name). the entrance of museum right in the backside of the King's statue. After visiting the underground museum we moved forward to the Gyeongbokgung Palace. it was so crowded as so many tourists embarked from the tour buses. we therefore just wandering around and taking photos from outside of the palace. There is also an admission fee, but i am not quite sure how much it is."
28,3.0,Interesting but not a must. When you walk around the palaces walk to the square. The king is waiting patiently for you.
29,3.0,It's a nice square but busy with traffic around it. The sculpture was really cool and there was an event going on so there was a lot going on whilst we were there.
30,3.0,This statue is in the middle of a busy street. The giant square in the photograph doesn't really exist. There is a wide median in the middle of a busy street and the dirt area around/behind it seems to be permanently occupied by protesters and vendors since it's almost directly across the street from the American embassy. Having said that the statue is of the last and what Korean's believe greatest King Korea has ever had. Note that he's carrying a book not a sword.
31,5.0,"Not sure about weekdays but on the weekend (both Saturday and Sunday) we were there, it was the hub of local activities from which one gets to see local life.  On the Saturday evening we visited there was another THAAD demonstration and the northern end of the square were flanked by what seemed like more than 100 police buses.   The two boulevards on either side of the square we closed to traffic.  When it ended with a parade, the police were lining the streets and the whole event concluded peacefully.  At the southern end, there were booths showing displays of a ferry disaster and people calling for action.  In between the statue of the great King Sejong looks south and below that is the museum to his honor - a great place to visit and understand why the Koreans revere this king.On Sunday morning, there were lots of activities in the square.  To name a few, there was a play with the actors and actresses dressed in traditional garb, there was a free calligraphy event where one can choose a proverb or saying from a book and have it written out on rice paper in Korean by one of the calligraphers, there was a demonstration against environmentally dirty air, there were booths with craft activities for children and adults.Combine your visit to the Gyeongbokgung Palace and other attractions and this square on a weekend and your experience is all the more complete."
32,5.0,"There is always something going on in the square. We discovered a museum underneath this statue of King Sejong the Great - it had a wonderful section on the Hangul writing system and the inventions of King Sejong. Another time when we came there were memorial events for the boat disaster. From the square, you can visit museums, the main palace, tours, and it is close to fascinating streets and shopping and eating areas. Activities enough for a day or so!"
33,4.0,"We walked from the palace at one end to the N. Seoul Tower at the other - about an hours walk. Plenty to see (museums, monuments). Plenty we didn't see in the streets and roads that go off at a tangent - you'd need a months stay to investigate them all."
34,4.0,"The square itself is very impressive considering its sheer size. However in winter, when there are no flowers the square looks a little desolate. However it provides a stunning view on Gwanghwamun Gate"
35,4.0,"it's on the busy main street you cannot miss. The King (1397-1450) was the 4th king of the Joseon dynasty. His visionary concerns were rooted in Neo-Confucian principles of benevolence, pursuit of knowledge, and improvement of society. This led to many scientific, technological, artistic and administrative innovations but none as singularly revolutionary as the invention of the Korean alphabet, which would liberate the written word from nobility down to the masses.Across the street is the U.S. Embassy, just as an FYI.Mount Bugak offers an impressive backdrop."
36,4.0,The square that places the statues of King Sejong and Admiral Yin Sunshin. Very nice place to walk in the evening while enjoying the evening skyline views. Also walking distance to Cheonggyecheon stream.Stop at Gwanghamun station if you are travelling by train.
37,4.0,"A great place to start your whole Seoul trip! Get off the subway, walk through the square and then onto the palace. At around 11 there is the changing of the guard!"
38,4.0,Interesting place with different activities ongoing such as protests. Underground area to learn more about the history of King sejong and the warrior.
39,5.0,"If you go to Gyeongbukgung Palace, you will see this square in front of the Palace. Instead of seeing the Palace, and then walk the Square, I suggest you print the Gwanghwamun Square Walking Tour from The Seoul Guide website, and approach the Palace from the Square. Do your own free tour of the Square at your own pace.. Take subway to the Gwanghwamun subway, and get out from Exit 5. Start the walking tour from here. It will take you all the way to the gate of the Gyeongbukgung Palace. Because of the ongoing street protests against President Park, our hotel advised against going to Gwanghwamun Square on Saturdays and Sundays when the square is a venue of protest marches. Behind the King Sejong statue is a mini museum - we went on a Monday, and the mini museum was closed. Be careful, cos if you go on a Tuesday, the Gyeongbukgung Palace is closed on Tuesdays. So if you have time constraint, I suggest you just do the walking tour on your own, and then head for the Gyeongbukgung Palace. At the Palace, be in time to join an English tour."
40,4.0,"Visited at the end of October and the was so much going on in the square.  Army cadets doing marching drills, concerts, musicians. Very entertaining and all free."
41,3.0,"An all important Tourist spot, the Square is not quite an attraction by itself but visited alongside nearby tourists spots of the Palace, Museum & Hanook village. The close to 20,000 sqm Gwanghwamun Square 광화문광장 is located at the center of Sejong-ro which connects Gwanghwamun Gate to other end at Sejong –ro junction. Two towering statues of Admiral Yi Sun-Shin and Sejong the Great dominates the view.  They are both great and influential people in Korean history, greatly admired.From the northern end Gwanghwamun (Gate) is the impressive Gyeongbokgung Palace and the massive mountains behind. the subway Gwanghwamun Station is just nearby .Probably takes up ½ hour of visiting time afterwhich one can proceed to the Korean History museum, the Museum dedicated to king Sejong and Yi Sun Sin, the Sejong performance art centre and Gyeongbokgung Palace are all within walking distance. Shaped more like a rectangle there are normally side walk stalls of Events along the beautifully paved walkway. Wonderful spots to take some great photo along the central walkway, which we did.From here we next drop by the nearby Bukchok Hanok village and Insadong before heading back hotel."
42,3.0,"This leads up to one of the palaces, and it is something you must see, and then you've seen it. I found contemporary Seoul much more compelling than these historical relics, but one can't really skip them, can one?"
43,5.0,"Certainly on weekends,holidays,and fairs this is a great place to see Koreans. People watching at its best"
44,4.0,Statues of Admiral Yi Sun-Shin and King Sejong are a must-see. They are over guarded by the Police and you can understand why as soon as you see them.
45,4.0,"Whilst in Seoul there was always something happening in this area with swarming people and side walk stalls. It is beautiful paved and features 2 magnificent statues, Sejong The Great and Admiral Yi Sun-Sin. On the northern end is the impressive Gyeongbokgung Palace. From this location it is easy to enter the subway network or simply amble along the wide walkways heading south to City Hall and shopping."
46,4.0,"We stumbled upon this square after leaving Cheonggyecheon and on our way to Gyeongbokgung Palace.  This square is very impressive with two major statues.  Good history, lots of the explanations in English.  It was well worth the time to see this."
47,4.0,The open area where there is two statue here located in front of gyeongbongguk palace. sometimes they held festival here
48,5.0,"While the statues of King Sejong and Admiral Yi are impressive, you can take the stairway to the underground museums dedicated to both of these icons and you are likely to be even more impressed. Both museums are top notch tributes that explain the importance of both of these figures in Korean history. The cost is free! If you benefited from this review, please click the helpful button."
49,3.0,"A nice place to visit on a sunny day. Besides the historical statues and tiles, it is fun to see the children play in the fountains."
50,5.0,"We kept passing this place up on our extended trip to Seoul to visit family. I researched what the place was and found out it’s a memorial to King Sejong. Thus I wanted to check it out. The only problem was when we finally got around to visiting it, it was snowing and nearing blizzard type conditions. That was sad because on other occasions, there were many people out talking, eating, dancing, people with protests signs and even Christian groups out singing. This is a cool little section in the middle of Seoul and if you’d like to get a sense of Korean culture and daily life, I’d highly recommend it."
51,5.0,"I love this place. You can see Mt.Bugak behind Kyungbok palace which is surrounded by modern sky scrapers. There is so much going on. It is a vibrant,fun place one must visit. It is not so commercialized as some other big cities. It is packed with culture, history, and fun!"
52,3.0,"nothing spectacular, just photo taking for 'i've been here' sake... but can see gwanghwamun at the background of the statue, quite nice."
53,5.0,"This is a busy square, with plenty to see.  There's a metro station right underneath, so it's easy to get to.  Beneath the square, there are shops too, including a large book store, food outlets and clean toilets.Seoul City Hall and Deoksugung Palace are a short walk from one end of the square; Gyeongbokgung Palace is at the other end of the square.In or immediately adjacent to, the square itself is the 40th Anniversary Monument of Gojong's Enthronement, and statues of Sojung the Great King along with some of the inventions he is responsible for, and Admiral Wi and his ship in which he defeated the Japanese navy.  There's a subterranean display of their respective achievements.The United States Embassy is right there too, with a constant, massive police contingent.Right now (March, 2016), the square is hosting the sad Gwanghwamum 416 Family Memorial Alter, mourning those who lost their lives in the April 2014 sinking of the Sewol Ferry. Nine bodies were never recovered. The sinking claimed the lives of 250 high school students on an excursion, eleven teachers, and 43 other members of the public and crew - a total of 304 people.  They have a display there, and you can sign a petition calling for an investigation as to how the disaster happened, and for the wreck to be raised to try to find the missing bodies so they can be reunited with their families.  Very sad indeed."
54,4.0,"This place is in the Downtown Seoul area. All the buildings here are pretty much government buildings. The statues are located in the center of the road and the walking area is pretty long or at least a good distance. If you are in Seoul, I would stop here!I found it really interesting to learn about the history of King Sejong and how he came to create the Korean alphabet. Below the square is a museum about King Sejong. The entrance is just behind the statue of the king."
55,5.0,"I enjoy visiting Gwanghwamum square often. There are always lots of people and things to see and do. The ever changing pop up tents, activities, and sights make it a must visit for travelers and locals alike."
56,5.0,Just the statue of Sejong the Great. Not really spectacular but on the way to the Gyeongbokgung palce. So you can take a couple of photos and carry on further.
57,4.0,You should leave your foot print here even you wearing shoe. Visit it when weather is clear or you will on trouble to look for shelters.
58,4.0,"Nice square in the heart of Seoul worth a look either when visiting Gyeongbokgung palace or in the evening when there are often street preformances. I have seen acrobatics, drum bands and classical Korean singers around the square from around 1800 (not so many in winter). There are two main statues and it can be a nice way to walk to or from the palace."
59,4.0,"good walk on a good weather towards Gyeongbokgung Palace. Ample space with modern buildings on the both sides. Police were line on side, not sure if it's a daily thing or just for the day."
60,3.0,"Gwanghwamun Square is a large public space situated in the middle of Sejong-ro, just south of Gyeongbokgung Palace . The plaza is 34 metres wide and over 500 meters wide and includes a few interesting things to see.  Here you find large scale monuments to beloved King Sejong the Great and Admiral Yi Sun-Sin, both important historical figures in Korean history. The statues are facing the south, providing a nice photo ops in front of Gwanghwamun Gate and the palace in the background. Another interesting attraction which can be accessed from Gwanghwmun Square is the underground 'The Story of King Sejong and The Story of Admiral Yi Sun-Sin'. This is a combined collection of learning displays and information, a very helpful attraction for those who wish to learn more about these two great men. Overall, they have done a nice job with Gwanghwamun Square. History buffs will appreciate the attractions here and others will find it worth a quick stop before or after visits to Gyeongbokgung when spending time in this area of Seoul."
61,3.0,"The square has nothing much to see thou but walk, 2statues where you can take photos. Might be holding lots of history thou but for layman nothing much."
62,5.0,This is a big area with lots happening when we were there end of August sept we saw the demonstration of the protest of the 9 children still missing after the ferry disaster. It was very sad they had a tent were you could sign the papers to protest to the government . Plus other things like little stalls etc
63,3.0,"we walk along from deoksugung palace toward gyeongbokgung palace.pass by Gwanghwamun Square, and also protester's sewol ferry disaster."
64,4.0,One very acessible photo spot in seoul!  Big square if you are there on the right day something interesting might go on. Close to a lot of other tourist attractions therefore as a tourist you will most likely end up her! ^_^
