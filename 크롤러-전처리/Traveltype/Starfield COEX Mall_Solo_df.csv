1,4.0,"It is huge and it is very very easy to get lost. So honestly check out the library and then some local stores, because otherwise it is a large mall with a pretty good food court."
2,5.0,"I walk here at least one Saturday each month, to shop at No Brands and The Hyundai stores, eat at one of the many restaurants,  pay my mobile bills at the SK.Premium store, watch a movie at Megabox, have a smoothie from Joe & the Juice and walk around for a while looking for sales in the myriad of other shops in this large modern underground mall. Definitely worth a visit and it's easy to reach by bus or subway."

5,4.0,A place with everything what you want!  And the most spectacular ‚ÄòStarfield Library‚Äô üìö is the highlight herer.
6,5.0,Huge and packed mall! There¬¥s something for everyone. Also great for buying fun souvenirs or toys. Many coffe shops and restaurants. You can easily kill many many hours in here. Dont forget to visit the peaceful bongeunsa temple right next to the mall.
7,3.0,"Worth a visit just to see the library. If you are staying in one of the nearby hotels, it's a good place to walk around in the evening."
8,4.0,"Specially traveled here to visit the library. Not very huge, but definitely worth taking some nice pictures. Also dropped by the SM museum and aquarium since I was already there. Had a quick lunch at the basement CJ foodcourt. Limited options and food was alright."
9,4.0,"This is stunning mall, the big dashing design libraries and equipped with high brand clothes and food, there also kimchi museum, my planned to korea 2nd time is not to explore mall but my ‚Äúnew‚Äù friend tag me along to her ittn so i was amazed with this huge mall."
10,3.0,"This mall has an amazing core library and that‚Äôs all, it has the same shops than any other mall, and for instance uniqlo has fewer clothes or Kakao friends shop is smaller than others. So if you are going to stay a couple of days in Seoul it doesn‚Äôt worth a visit"
11,3.0,Found an under 10$ store here and bought a lot of items.  It's an underground mall. Very large and easy to get lost. Has a fantastic library here and an aquarium
12,5.0,"A different interior from the usual mall. I like that wherever you came from, there is an entrance/exit nearer for you. And finding a library in the center of the mall, with awesome placing of so many books, is so great."
13,4.0,"C1 ( 2017.04.13 ) I visited this shopping mall because I want to buy some books. There had many facilities like restaurant, shop, book store and theater, etc. Many brand shop and food court was operating, too. All was good with good atmosphere, but there was confused because of complicated load. Need detailed road sign, I think."
14,2.0,"A large mall between the 2 intercontinental hotels, and linked to the CALT airport bus stationMiddle tier and quite boring. Some global brands like Zara, little known ones like dyptique, and many local brandsQuite difficult to find good food also"
15,4.0,"My first time to Seoul was in 2003 and one of the so called tourist spots was COEX. Haven't been back to Coex for almost 15 years since my last visit (even I have been to Seoul many times after 2003). Good to see that Coex has changed to a better outlook, it seems so new to me."
16,3.0,"visited here since it's one of the biggest malls in korea. wasn't really too impressed by the shopping. but if you're an SM fan, there's an SM Coex Artium area which has a shop (usually packed with fans) and all sorts of other things to do. Also there's a city airport on level 1 that has a money changer that provides pretty decent rates."
17,5.0,excellent venue for conference. really enjoy it and would like to come again in the future for any upcoming events thereexcellent place !!
18,4.0,"It's the biggest underground shopping mall in Asia in the coex building. One of greatest aquariums connected to the coax mall, exhibition, convention center, intercontinental hotel, casino & movie theater etc. Line2, exit8 of seolleung station."
19,4.0,"One of the interesting places to visit in Seoul is the COEX Mall.I would say don't miss it. The best way to get there from the city center, if you are taking the subway, is to take line 3(the orange line). Line 2(green line) will also take there, but line 3 takes less than 25 minutes.Take line 3 to Seoul university station and then take line 2 to Samseong station.Whenever you get out of the train look at the station and vicinity map posted on the platform to see the closest exit to the mall. As you enter the mall, make a right and you will see the information desk and a virtual interactive map of the layout of the mall.Check this out before you start exploring the place. Check the various restaurants and the food court before you decide to eat. Believe me, you wouldn't want to miss out on some of the best food in Seoul, all under one roof. Also check out the various retail shops, just browse, even if you don't buy anything, this would be an interesting experience. Once you are done with the mall, check out the area around the mall. There is always something going on.When I visited in September, there was a free K-pop concert ( Korea Sale Festa) going on near the mall."
20,4.0,"The Mall has all Kinds of Brands that is usually found in the Market, the Mall is very Spacious and Probably the Biggest in the City, it has an Adjoining Art Center and Other Places for Shopping. it can be easily reached through Taxi, Trains and Buses."
21,5.0,"This is the luxury place ,Shopping department store,And also aquarium located there , you can also reach casino near by.Great to see , but closing soon at night !"
22,4.0,"A great place for a rainy day!It's easy to get lost in here because it really is big!Loads of shops (particularly cosmetic shops), cafes and restaurants!In general the shops here are more expensive.I could spend several hours here browsing and shopping without getting bored as there's loads to see!"
23,4.0,"Like other extra huge malls, COEX mall has everything you need under one roof. The unique point is, it's connected to city airport check-in mall, 5 star hotels, Hyundai Department Store, world trade centre and conveniently link to Samseong metro station. Local cafe and eating places at cheaper price  mostly hidden at the corner; more premium cafe and restaurant is at easy to spot location."
24,1.0,"If you are looking for a mall where lots of things happen don't go to this place. They have every brand and every big shop which involves clothes, shoes and accessoires. Just 1 marvel shop and some minor kid stores. Other areas got way more variety in stores."
25,4.0,"For the SM Town fans you can buy some of merchandise in this mall, there is also digital theater for watching. You can recording your sound and become like SM Town singer."
26,5.0,A huge mall with most international brands available. Ideal for those looking to buy branded stuffs. There is a lotte duty free store in the mall.
27,4.0,"The largest shopping mall in Seoul.There are many stores, restaurants, cafes, cinemas, concerts,‚Ä¶‚Ä¶as well as a Kimchi Museum and an Aquarium.  The mall is connected to the Hyundai Department Store and at least two 5 star hotels. .You can spend half a day here, to buy, to play, to eat, to be entertained, and even to learn.  A paradise for shopaholics and tourists."
28,5.0,"A very big mall. Need clearer map. Great variety of shops. Consider putting a supermarket in the mall, then will be perfect."
29,5.0,Located in East of Kangnam area.  There are many restaurants and pubs.  Always crowded with young people and tourist. There cinema as well.
30,4.0,"This complex is quite large and you can reach there either from Sports Complex Station or Bongeunsa Station. With many local or international brands, restaurants, casino, duty free shop & hotel, there is not enough signages to ensure you are on the correct way to the destination, so I have to check the digital directories from time to time."
31,4.0,"Shopping, aquarium, hotel, restaurants, mart all within one complex with connections to Hyundai department store, the CALT building and more, can get lost easily however there are directories everywhere, don't bother going to the customer desk, they can't really speak English."
32,3.0,"Pretty modern indoor mall (connected underground by subway). Lots of a great eats and there's a movie inside that plays the hits of the day. My goal was never to actually shop here but from the looks of it, I'd go elsewhere. Seems overpriced and in certain places, too specialized - or is that the point? There's an aquarium inside too which I was really tempted to go but I'd just eaten a bunch of sushi and didn't need a reminder that I had probably eaten Nemo."
33,4.0,"I've been here twice and I have to say the first time was better. While it was under construction it seemed like it had SO much potential to be bigger and greater. The second time I visited, after the renovations, it was just a giant regular mall with regular stores. Or maybe I was just tired of Korea by then."
34,5.0,"It is large and maze-like enough to get lost in. There are nice stores and lots of  cafes and good restaurants. And then there is a huge Hyundai department store. The first level of Hyndai mall  is like a big kitchen with treats from all over the world. It has lots of bakeries selling awesome treats like cheese cakes and other desserts and fruits.,And you can find every luxurious brand under the Sun in  on other levels this mall.The maze and the vastness of the mall allows you to  wander around aimlessly!!The mall is connected to three five star hotels Oakwood, Intercontinental and Gran Intercontinental. It seems there is also an aquarium closeby. I cudnt visit that.So walk around, shop, eat and tire urself!!"
35,4.0,"This mall is recently renovated and it shows. It is very clean and organized. Very modernized. Has a huge variety of shops and food selections you can choose from. Although a lot of the shops sell high end products that are not cheap, I would only recommend if you have a few more days in Seoul, or near the temple close by."
36,3.0,"I found the mall to be very large and easy to walk around. Did not pay much attention to prices, but just the experience of being there was enough for me."
37,4.0,"Came here opening weekend.  If you're American, this place will be most familiar to you.  There's an aquarium, which I didn't enter, but seemed to be really popular.  Lots of local designers and food options.  My mom even got her hair done at a salon here.  It's definitely worth visiting if you have an afternoon free in SK."
38,3.0,"I was there at the end of Nov, days after their official opening date of Nov 27th. The mall is huge and it was pretty decent. There are still lot of store spaces to be filled and lot of restaurants to be open by early December, per signs at the doors. The Hyundai department store is worth to check out, mostly their food section in the basement. I think it's a good place to do shopping and eat. I didn't go to the aquarium or the movie theater so I don't know if they are worth the visit."
39,4.0,"I had a convention on COEX and I had little chance to visit the mall. Before I came to Seoul I heard that COEX mall is one the famous indoor shopping mall. But when I visited there, they were having renovation. Most of the shops were closed. Hmmm... But still you can find some shops opened. It would be very convenient if the weather is bad. But it's worth vising for those of you who have conference or business in COEX but if not, I recommend you to visit Garosu-gil instead."
40,3.0,"Located underground, it's quite small shopping mall but there is a wide selection of Korean and Japanese restaurants."
41,2.0,Right now the COEX Mall is undergoing a massive renovation.  At least 80% of the facility is closed.  The English handouts state it will reopen in December 2014.What's left isn't bad but...  There are other Malls in Seoul worth visiting in the meantime.
42,4.0,"I went to the COEX Mall last Sunday. It is conveniently located above Samseong MRT station. Part of the mall was undergoing renovations but there were still many shops open. There is a good variety of restaurants there- Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Italian, Western, etc. I saw many people in their twenties (mostly young couples) at COEX so if you are a young person you will probably enjoy the atmosphere there."
43,5.0,"Hello everyone,I always use this application, when I go abroad,so I guess you'll see my review, before you come to Samgsung road.Actually I'm Korean, and I live in the Samsung road(10 minutes by walk from COEX.)My grade for Coex is 5stars, because there are many wonderful restaurants, and shops, and etc.But not now.From 2013, Coex mall is on a remodelling, so if you come here, you can use just 2 services.First one is a mega box theater, and 2nd one is a aquarium.I think, It's a terrible season for you to come here.For me, I live in here so I go there to see a moive, but you don't have to see the movie here in Korea. Instead of Coex mall,I recommand you some sites.1st one is Í≤ΩÎ≥µÍ∂Å., which is a royal palace of CHOSUN dynasty. You can see the Korean traditonal structures, and traditional clothes of royal family.2nd is Insa-dong, where you can drink Korean-tea, and see the gallery.3rd one is ÎèôÎåÄÎ¨∏ ÏãúÏû•, which is an cheap market for clothes, and sports equipments.4th is  Î™ÖÎèô, the downtown of Seoul.You can see the cathedral, and korean traditional market, and may complex marts.I think, You can shop here, instead of Coex.5th is  Ïù¥ÌÉúÏõê, this is a road for foreigners. You can go by the subway line no.6, so It's very easy to find it.There are may restaurants of western foods, and pub& clubs are  in Ïù¥ÌÉúÏõê. So I reccomend you to go there in the night.Next is ÏÇºÏ≤≠Îèô.It's a little bit expensive, but there are may beautiful cafes, and delicious Korean restuarants.My last reccomendation is Ïó¨ÏùòÎèÑ.It's a little island, in the Han-river, and in Ïó¨ÏùòÎèÑ, there is a nice river side park.You can jog along the river.(Beer & Chicken will be a perfect selection. You can odrer by phone at the park.)And for the restuarant,I'll say just one thing.Please stop by the  ÌåîÏÉâÏÇºÍ≤πÏÇ¥, in Ïã†Ï¥å(sinchon).It's very popular Korean pork bbq restuarant, and so many Japanese love this restaurant.I believe that you'll be satisfied.That's all.I post this review,just because I see so many foriegners in the Coex these days,and everyone was dissapointed.So I can tell you, not to come Coex, until 2014.(The remodelling""ll be finished on 2014.)Thank you."
44,1.0,"Decidied to take advantage of a rainy day by visiting the Coex Mall for a spot of shop and drop retail therapy. It wasn't until I arrived on Subway line 2 Coex Mall (World Trade Centre) stop and wandered through the maze of boarded gangways that I became aware it was under refurbishment and only a handful of shops were open, alongside the Mega Box Cinema, a few restaurants, and the slightly fishy smelling Aquarium that initially had me thinking the loo's needed a good cleaning...you can imagine my disapointment as I navagated myself back through the maze of boarded gangways looking for the light of freedom empty handed wishing I hadn't bothered to visit.With this in mind, my advice would be to avoid until refurbishment is complete....when this will be is anyones guess!!"
45,5.0,"Very convenient as going through this location I have done with my duty free shopping, cinema, gadget browsing, the COEX Aquarium, attending conventions (such as the 1st Korean Style Week) and right across it is the Bongeunsa Temple, where you can lose half a day or more without noticing except for your really tired feet :)"
46,3.0,"Coming all the way from Myeongdong, I took the subway to get to Coex and Bongeunsa Temple.Armed with a map and the directions I got from the KTO website, I just followed it and emerged in front of a group of buildings that includes COEX MALL and World Trade Bldg. At the other end of the block, after a lot of walking (I was on my own DIY adventure with the map so I was looking like a lost little person), I found the Bongeunsa Temple on the other side of the street. The pedestrian lane connects Coex to the temple fronting each other.I wanted to see that temple where the Korean actor Lee Min Ho emerged from (particularly the Buddha Statue within the temple) in his KDrama 'Faith'.Going back, I ate lunch at Coex food court, found DunkinDonut for coffee."
47,2.0,"It is a very large and empty mall, rampling and expensive, with unatractive atractions. Only good thing: ends in Hyundai food court"
48,4.0,"This mall is big and busy. The bathrooms are really nice and colorful. I liked shopping here. I bought some jewelry, ate some ice cream and window shopped for the most part. Had to mime a bit,and practice some of my very limited Korean since most of the vendors did not speak fluent English but that is the fun in it all."
49,5.0,"If you want a versatile place to do shopping, and you have a lot of time to do so, you may want to look into dropping by COEX. Reasonably priced, great bargains galore and great eating experience. Don't expect high end stores to be within the area, but then again, you can look into great bargains of products that are quite lovely. I thought I could cover the place in an hour's time, ended up staying for 4 hours :)"
