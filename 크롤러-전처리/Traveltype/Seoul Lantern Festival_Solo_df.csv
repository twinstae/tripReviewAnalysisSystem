0,5.0,Mid November don’t miss this beautiful event in Seoul! Located on a small river Cheonggyecheon on Euljiro this is so beautiful at dark! Many families and a very pleasant and nice walk.
1,4.0,It happens every November and is a wonderful attraction to stroll along the Cheonggyecheon stream. The artists let their imaginations soar and the lanterns can be fanciful or literal.
2,4.0,"I came here to watch the Seoul Lantern parade, and it was beautiful!! So many big and beautiful, and culture lanterns :)."
3,4.0,"Wonderful way to begin the festive holiday season. From the first Friday in November to the third Sunday in November bright lanterns are on display.  Celebrating history, multiculturalism, or pure entertainment this was a fun display. There were vendors of food, wearable lights, and an opportunity to make a floating lantern yourself. Easy to get to on public transport (metro: Jongo 3-ga Station, Jonggak Station, or Euljiro 3-ha station) and a short walk to the river. The lanterns are staged in the water along 1.2km between Cheonggyecheon Plaza and Supyogyo Bridge.  Lots to do in the local area as well. Would definitely go back and bring the children. Photos just can’t do it justice (at least my iPhone photos!)."
4,4.0,"It is very nice and enjoyable festival, where many activities are displayed along with cultural introduction. A wonderful international gathering."
