1,4.0,"We were walking towards the Gyeongbukgong Palace to watch the changing of the guards when we came to a huge momument of a well known person in South Korea, the Statue of Sejong the Great. We did not waste time and started clicking for souvenir photos and at the same time searching Google to learn about this Great Man sitting on a big chair atop a pedestal in the Gwanghwamun Square walk path leading to the palace. We learn that Sejong the Great was born in 15May1397 and was the 4th King of Joseon dynasty of Korea. He ""reinforced the Confucian policies then created and promulgated the Korean alphabet Hangul.""He died either in the year 1442 or 1450 according to scholars of Korean history."
2,4.0,Iconic statue of Great King Sejong. The location is strategic and can be accessed from the Gwanghwamun Gate. Very good place to take a quick photo session or admire Korean Culture and History.
3,4.0,"There is always something going on in the park around this statue, but that doesn't reduce how cool he is against the backdrop of the Palace and the mountains.  Worth visiting."
4,5.0,"In another post re: Gwanghamun Square, I mention that there is a museum that you can enter for free for a great cultural experience.  I highly recommend the King Sejong Exhibit Hall which is located at the backside under the statue."
5,3.0,"Interesting as statues go, but for me worth mentioning is the revived stream with a gushing waterfall (frozen in the winter) nearby. Locals sit in the shade of the bridge and dip their feet in the water in summer."
6,5.0,"Taking into consideration that he was the creator of the most logic phonetic alphabet you just have to show the respect to such great mind. Of course, this is subjective thought by Hangul enthusiast :)"
7,5.0,went into Seoul for the day and saw the Statue of King Sejong. It was so amazing just to think of the great accomplishments he brought to the world.
8,3.0,"This status is located in the middle of big square in the modern city theme , close to Koreans historic palaceTakes just 10 to 15 min to visitI'd rather to spend more time in the palace which is very beautiful :)"
9,5.0,"The museum and his statue are awesome. Definetly a must see. Such important man in the history of Korea, creating the Hangul. Worth it!"
10,5.0,"He's the man who built the Korean alphabet - the basis to the entire language - kind of a big deal. All kidding aside, there's a museum underground that provides a lot more of the historical background - definite must-see if it's your first time touring Seoul."
11,5.0,"Nice, big statue about the king in a great location. Middle of the square by one of the biggest temples in Korea"
12,4.0,"The statue of the man who gets credit for introducing the Korean alphabet is cool. It's also a great place to get a wonderful city view of the Gwanghwamun area. It's conveniently near Cheonggyecheon Stream, Insadong, Gyeongbok Palace, and the Jonggak area of restaurants and shops."
13,4.0,"read more about king sejong and his achievement at the museum which is located at the bottom of the statue. during the time of visit, november 2016, we simply entered without paying.do go during the daytime and you can head over to Gyeongbokgung Palace when you are done with King Sejong's exhibitionbut AVOID going on saturday evening as there is a massive protest currently going on on every saturday evening, you wont want to be squeeze with thousands of people gathering there or ""millions"" as what the media have been saying"
14,3.0,It is just a statue which you are bound to see on a walking tour of Seoul. Sejong was a King and is also credited with devising the Korean Hangul alphabet.
15,3.0,"as an attraction on its own, it is not something you plan to see.But as part of a bigger route then you will pass this statue.a good route is:Gwanghwamun Square (where this statue is located) - Gyeongbokgung Palace - Bukchok Hanok village - Changeokgung Palace - Insadong - Cheonggyecheon Stream"
16,3.0,History lovers would enjoy learning about this king's achievements in the history. The statue looks great in the day and even better at night with the lights. Police are always around the area for security purpose. It's a great place to take a nice photo and it's just a very short walk away from Gyeongbokgung Palace.
17,4.0,It's located on the side street near Gwanghwamun gate. By just walking from the gate and you'll find the statue. Very iconic !
18,4.0,The inscription of the words on the statue are a reminder of the history of King Sejong... A great king who created the Hangul.
19,4.0,Since it is just next to the main entrance to the Palace you will be near anyway. It is a nice spot to see the gate to the palace surrounded by green mountains. Not worth to see it on its own though
20,3.0,"If you're going to visit the largest palace (Gyeongbokgung Palace) You might as well take picture with King Sejong and Admiral Yi. They are located at Gwanghwamun Sq, which is a stretch of road leading to the palace. To go here: Take metro line 5 and stop at Gwanghwamun St, exit 2, directly to the Gwanghwamun Sq. Move towards the palace and stop and take pic along the road."
21,5.0,This is in a square between the road leading to and from the palace gates. Very well done with musem with entrance in the back.
22,5.0,"It was not a planned trip. To be honest, I was having high fever on that day but who could miss out on sightseeing even if we are on our last breath. Ok so moving on, I needed the loo, to wash my face and to get out of the freaking cold, I saw an entrance with an elevator and I though, why not? I told my other companions to follow me. We took the elevator down and to my surprise, it was a free museum. I walked in and immediately I realized that this is my kind of place. Full of history and information on King Sejong and the Great general Yi Shun Shin. I was dumbfounded by the beauty of the place and best of all, it was underground. Amazing. Most of the reading panels are in English and you can even ask for an audio guide from the Information counter. Of course I did get my toilet break plus a 15 minutes nap on one of the benches but when I woke up. I suddenly realized this place was kinda familiar. Then I already knew that I had watched this place on TV before. And for those who didn't know, like my companions didnt, it was one of the shooting place for Running Man's episode 7 if I am not mistaken but with all the history around, who really care? Except me.. Overall, I am happy I stumbled upon this wonderful treasure whilst looking for a toilet."
23,5.0,"This is a fairly new statue (by new I mean like 2009) that stands in the middle of a really large street in Seoul. You'll see the statue if you take line 5 (purple) on the subway and get off at Gwanghwamun station. It stands in front of Kyungbok Palace, the largest/main Chosun palace in Seoul. The area in general is an interesting area where you can see the intersection of the old and modern."
24,3.0,I passed by this so many times but never once stopped to read it. A statue of an beloved Korean King who invented Hangeul: the Korean alphabet. He is a hero because it made it possible for the common people to read and write as the Chinese characters that were used were very difficult to learn and reserved for scholars.
25,4.0,"Been here for a day tour while on a business visit.Very conveniently located in city, 15 min walk from holiday inn.Weather was very pleasant.Glad to see how they preserve such a ancient monument."
26,5.0,There are no adequate words to describe the majesty of the great benevolent king Sejong.Except for the ones he invented.Which you can see in the museum below.Check out the museum after taking a photo with this statue.
27,5.0,Amazing statue outside the palace. Still golden gleaming bright. Visit the museum accessible at the back and learn about him. Great statue and part of history.
28,3.0,"We were walking in the neighbourhood of our hotel when we pumped in to this statue, we were not able to see any sign in english telling what it was so we had to google. Not sure if this is something I'd specially go look after but was quite impressing in the dark. Seems to be a popular place to hang around for the locals as well during the evenings as the place was crowded every night."
29,5.0,We didn't have a lot of touring time in Seoul; but we did make time to stop to get photos of the beautiful statue of Sejong the Great.  it is huge and quite an impressive statue.
30,4.0,"The statue of King Sejong The Great is located in the Gwanghwamun Square along with the statue of Admiral Yi Sun-Shin.  A great way to see this area is to start from in front of Gyeongbokgung Palace and its front gate, Gwanghwamun.  You can reach this area best by Metro, orange line 3 and take exit 5.  Once in front of the gate you can look down the beautiful boulevard.  There is moving traffic on both sides, but the center square is wide and has much history.  King Sejong is credited with being the creator of the Korean alphabet, Hangeul.  The statute is simple but very impressive.  Just a simple block with the King sitting on top.  As part of the Joseon dynasty, this statute and Gwanghwamun Square is a national and culture treasure.  The water fountains and maybe a festival will be going on when you visit."
31,4.0,"You will immediately notice the statue when you are walking along the area. It is located in between the roads, dividing the traffic. The statue itself looks great. There are water fountain in front of the statue that opens at regular interval. It looks great both at night and day."
32,4.0,"Great just for a photo, however, many buildings and museums are around this area, Gwanghuamun. King Sejong statue is a great photo worthy place but just for the photo. In is centred in the massive street, and on both sides of the street are international embassies, museums, Sejong Theatre and shopping centres along with business buildings."
33,4.0,"A great night walk in Seoul...   start at the Gwanghwamun Gate of the Gyeongbokgung Palace, walk down through the Gwanghwamun Plaza and see the Statue of King Sejong the Great who is credited with inventing the Hangul alphabet. Continue down the plaza to see the imposing statue of Korean Navy Admiral Yi Sun Sin, often referred to as the Lord Nelson of Korea. You can take a peaceful break along the Cheonggyecheon Stream, before following this to Dongdaemun Gate, or continuing down the plaza to Namdaemun Gate. We preferred the latter.King Sejong is considered by Koreans to be the greatest of all the Kings, and is honored with his image on the 10,000 Korean Won bill. He is credited with the creation of the Hangul alphabet that Koreans still use today. He is also responsible for reversing the anti-science sentiment created by Confucianism and elevating science to an important place in Korean society, a value still held by Korean culture today.This monument is imposing during the daytime, and quite beautiful at night. Because it is one of the less visited sites, it is easy to get wonderful unobstructed night photos of this beautiful landmark."
34,4.0,"If you wanna know about Korean dynasty and The Great Sejong, you should come and visit his big monument located at the centre of Seoul city. The statue is surrounding by modern city of Seoul. Its also a great location to snap lots of pictures and worth visit too."
