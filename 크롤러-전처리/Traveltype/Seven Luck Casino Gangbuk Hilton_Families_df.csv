0,2.0,"Small casino, probably the size of 2 hotel ballrooms. Smoking is now only allowed in 2 tiny rooms at the opposite ends of casino. Under 10 blackjack tables, probably 20 baccarat tables, a few roulette tables, slots. Machine roulette and baccarat available. Spotted 2 three card poker. But that's about it. Since this is foreigners only, there's quite a mix of people. Dealers can understand hand signals for blackjack and basic English. Be wary of Chinese middle aged women tourists, they tend to nag at YOUR blackjack game. Great for a quick gambling fix, but probably a one off visit."
1,2.0,"I only know of this place because I stayed at the Hilton next door.  My mother (who is a big gambler) was initially excited but quickly became disappointed upon entering.  First of all, the place is pretty small.  I believe there might be less than a 50 slot machines in total.  Second, the machines are all pretty old and according to my mom, they weren't very fun or interesting. I'd say if you're looking for gambling action in Asia, head to Macau."
