0,5.0,"Historic and informative, took around 1 hour and a half to see everything around the prison. Ticket is 3000 won."
1,4.0,"We were at Seodaemun Independence Park which leads to the Seodaemun Prison History Hall. We didn’t get to visit the Prison as it was quite late in the afternoon and near the closing time.The park is like a green oasis compared to the noisy traffic just blocks away.There is a impressive archway, located at the entrance of the park, which was modelled after the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. This was where previously the envoys sent by the Chinese emperors to Korea were being received.There are stairs which leads to Dongnimmun metro station. Very convenient."
2,5.0,I would certainly come here if you are in Seoul. Set in a peaceful park it is hard to imagine this was a big prison for Koreans fighting for independence who were kept here by the Japanese. You can going into the cells and learn about the torture endured. It is a huge place. Took us about 2 hours to get around. Most of it is in English but it does sort of give up in a few areas. The main messages were were translated and delivered. There’s a gift shop.
3,5.0,"This prison history hall wasn't on our radar for our first visit to Seoul but for our second trip I was looking for something a little different, to discover more of the history of Seoul, and we certainly got it here.  Seodaemun Prison operated from 1908 to 1987, in 1988 it was designated National Historic Relic No.324, then in 1998 the History Hall was opened. The Prison History Hall is located in Seodaemun-gu, easily to accessed by Subway Line 3, Dongnimmun Station, from here it is a short walk.  Our self-guided tour prison history hall complex cost 3000 won each and lasted 1.25 hours using the brochure that we were given at the ticket office.  There was plenty of the information to read (Korean and English text), the displays were excellent and conveyed the significance and at times were quite emotional. The torture chamber was the most alarming with descriptions of the variety of tortures conducted on prisoners, at times with sound effects.  On the day of our visit the museum was well attended by nationals, young and old, and families. A very interesting morning."
4,4.0,"We have been to many prisons around the world, and this one had its own unique way to memorialize its prisoners.  Instead of death masks or head molds we have seen elsewhere (of newly executed prisoners), here we saw many molds of prisoners’ feet.  These were presented on individual prisoner plaques, with a three-dimensional view of the bottoms of their feet."
5,1.0,"I was really excited about seeing this. As we walked around, there were no less than 50 groups of children (likely on field trips from school). The children were running around, screaming, and in my opinion, being completely disrespectful in an area where many people died so that they could have freedom. Their teachers largely ignored the behavior, and used microphones with speakers to talk to the children creating such a loud a chaotic environment that we could not possibly concentrate on the tour. The reason why I give it one star is because even though there were signs all over asking for people to be quiet and there were staff members in every room, I didn't see  single staff member as the children or teachers to abide by the signs and be quiet. We left with headaches, shame :("
6,5.0,This was another find by accident. We spent a full day here and had a day of sadness & amazement of the human spirit. The people were so badly treated but seem to still keep their spirit and pride.
7,5.0,"We originally decided to visit here to fill in time, and so glad we did. The whole site has been refurbished and takes at least an hour to complete the route they suggest. Very good displays and explanations in English for us. As you walk around you could imagine what it would have been like for the prisoners under Japanese rule. Usually places like this only keep 1 or 2 buildings as a museum and destroy the rest but here you get to view basically the full occupied site."
8,5.0,"The prison museum and the surrounding area is interesting and for photographers a good place to visit.  I also entered the woods in the hills behind the prison and found some flowers and bugs to photograph.  The bugs were quite easy to photograph.  Patient and still while I was photographing them.  A tip for photographers here, for close up photography I got better results with my smartphone at close distance than with my dedicated cameras.The only drawback was lot of mosquito bites we had on this visit ;)"
9,4.0,Travelled to the museum from myeongdong for under USD6. Museum is tourist friendly with descriptions in English. The tour route is nicely planned to so you wont have to wander around and just follow the arrows. We were lucky that there was an exibition on the student uprising which was very interesting. Per person cost about 2400 korean won
10,5.0,"This former prison and history hall shows what lead up to the Japanese occupation in Korea in 1910 and what happened after that. It's a very sad history but will make you thankful for the blessings that you have. You'll see where prisoners, who fought against the Japanese soldiers were tortured, put into prison, biographies of male and female prisoners, and pictures of the people that died there. It's a sad reminder of how evil war can be.You can visit this place within an hour to an hour and a half. It's closed on Mondays (if a holiday falls on Monday then it's open on the holiday but closed on Tuesday). The hours are from 9:30-6:00pm from March to October and 9:30-5:00pm from November to February. The cost is ₩3,000 for adults, ₩1,500 for youth between 13-18, and ₩1,000 for children between 7-12. However I wouldn't recommend bringing young children here. It's located at Dongnimmun Station (Line 3), Exit 5."
11,5.0,"Unlike other reviews I felt a little disappointed with the availability of English translations (about 2/3rd of all signs) or English subtitles on videos (only 1 out of 4/5) as without a guide I'd like to read everything to get a good understanding of what's on display. Nonetheless gives the museum a good impression of the horrible time during Japanese suppression. Spent about 2,5 hours. Entrance fee is comparable to other museums, couple of Euros per person."
12,4.0,"A very interesting museum that takes a visitor from the colonial period through the 1980s. The story of Korean nationalism plays out through the displays. While there is little regarding the prison's use during the period following liberation, I was pleased to at least see some acknowledgment of the abuses suffered at that time by reformers. While the preponderance of the displays are in Korean only (this is Korea, after all), there are still enough English languages boards to inform the English-speaking visitor. This is a well done museum and a recommended stop for a visitor to Seoul - especially one who wants to understand the still-strained relationship with Japan and the emergent Korean nationalism that was torn apart in the Korean War."
13,5.0,"Amazing complex not far from the city center that tells a lot of the hardship korea had to face while under japanese occupation.Shocking to see what humans are able to do to each other,but thru this hopefully we are able to learn.After all it is a prison,and it gives a feeling of sadness but also in a good sense."
14,4.0,Very nice place considering the genre. We were met by a volunteer tour guide who spoke excellent English and was very up on the history of the prison. It was a good place to spend the day learning a little history.
15,3.0,"I guess it is a must for people that are into WWII stuff and history. It is well preserved, depicting specially the struggles of the more than 3,000 ""martyrs"" imprisioned there during the Japanese occupation of Korea, from 1910 to 1935. There is a whole section of the prison where the instruments of tortured are showed, plus testimonies, pictures, etc. Although you can follow in English, pretty much, there is a lot of stuff in Korean that it is not translated. Pretty shocking and graphic, make the actual American debate about ""water boarding"" a joke. It is not for everybody. I won't recommend it unless there is a specific interest."
16,5.0,Our visit to the prison was one of the most humbling experiences we had. The prison was used for political dissidents under Japanese rule and visiting the museum revealed the depths of human nature.I maybe wouldn't recommend going with children that are really young as some things can be quite could be upsetting. But for anyone who is interested in Japanese/Korean history this is a must see.The museum is one of the most interesting we have visited. It is rare that I find myself reading every display in a museum but I did at Seodaemun Prison.
17,4.0,To be done your last day in Seoul. Shows how corean prisoners were treated by the Japanese. Edifying.
18,4.0,"This is an interesting prison well layed out and easy to get to on the metro, Dongnimmun station. Located close to other major sights it is worth a visit if you like history and only takes a couple of hours. Not all the information is in English but most is. The museum covers the time of the Japanese occupation and includes a section on torture, so emotive but presented in a informative way."
19,3.0,"Interesting landmark in Seoul; I think it would clearer if they changed the name to the Korean Patriot History Hall because that is what the museum truly focuses on. If you are expecting an Alcatraz-type tour, you will be disappointed."
20,4.0,Interesting place. Easy to walk around in a couple of hours. Tells a very interesting story of the effects of the Japanese rule. I would have liked to hear the eye witness accounts from the prisoners but they were only available in Korean. Interesting explanations of some of the things the Japanese did to ensure they maintained absolute control over the   Korean prisoners.
21,4.0,"Off the beaten path (and less busy) compared to some of the main attractions but it's a gem of a place. This place should be ranked higher on the list of attractions in Seoul. It's a very moving place with a lot of great information about Japan's occupation of Korea and there are bunch of buildings to look through. Random Information:Cost was 3,000won for 1 adult.Plan to spend 1-2 hours here.There were vending machines with drinks available.Small gift shop at the end of your self-guided tour.One of the lesser busy places to visit on the weekend."
22,4.0,"I would highly recommend to spare few hours to visit this historical musuem. You get to see how freedom activist tortured by the Japanese, stay in the actual cell that housed prisoner, plus witness the actual execution chamber and secret passage to transport dead body out the prison. An eye opening experience. Very good way to learn history.https://vinshengloh.exposure.co/seodaemun-prison-seoul"
23,5.0,"I am just so glad I got to see this unfortunate slice of history come alive. The torture, the beatings, the hardship, the desperation and isolation of the exercise yard and the solitary confinement. It's all here. Superbly laid out and wonderfully preserved for future generations. This was the best thing I did while I was in Seoul. How the prison doesn't even make the top 20 attractions is just beyond me. Please go. You won't regret it."
24,4.0,"I'm a prison museum junkie, so I wouldn't say this is a fair review. I loved it here, even though a friend said it was for kids. The most interesting part was the part showing the torture methods used in the past, which were pretty mild and child friendly.Only complaint was that many of the displayed showed minimal English without elaboration, and some were even lacking English descriptions. As I was interested in reading about the history, this was rather disappointing."
25,4.0,"Even though the prison was used after the Japanese occupation ended, the displays mainly focus on the harsh treatment Koreans suffered under Japanese rule. As a result it has an anti Japanese vibe, but I'm not sure how you could tell the story in a way that honors the thousands of Koreans who died without sounding a little anti Japanese.The prison is right next to Dongnimmun Station on subway line 3 which makes it really easy to get to. Today, only a fraction of the original prison complex remains standing, but you can still see the workshop, some of the cells, the execution room, the torture rooms in the basement, the walls and the watch towers. lots of pictures and more info on my blog here http://gdaykorea.blogspot.kr/2014/05/seodaemun-prison-history-museum-old-seoul-prison.html"
26,4.0,"It is no auschwitz take of that what you will, but it still a stark reality and a peice of history that most people do not visit. The presentation and the history lit before the actual buildings are Korean heavy, so recommended to have someone with you for translations, I was lucky enough to have someone with me who spoke Korean, but what we did find that the translations omitted certain things in either the English or Korean, so be wary of the translations that are presented for you. Overall a must see as it helps really make you realize how much S.Korea has changed in such a short time."
27,5.0,This museum highlights a part of Korean history that some may choose to forget. You can tour the actual rooms where they tortured prisoners. This can be very disturbing but it is also educational as you cannot forget what happened to these people. You cannot imagine living in such a place and going through what these people did. This museum is a bit far from the city center but we got there by subway and then walked so make sure you have good directions.
28,4.0,This place was the prison during the japanese colonial and pre-democracy age. A lot of historial information was shown about the flighters against the japanese for their independent.
29,5.0,I'm not usually that impressed with museums but visiting Seodaemun Prison History Hall ended up being one of the highlights of our time in Seoul. It's design is very visitor friendly and the information is presented in various interesting ways. I found the visit very thought provoking and it gave me a much better understanding of Korea's difficult history.
