0,5.0,"You're experience may vary depending on the exhibition on offer at the time but with regards to the facility itself, they were great. Staff were very helpful.One tip: definitely wait for a docent to give you a tour of the exhibit as they really help to point out features you may have missed on your own.In my experience, my ticket allowed endless re-visits so I was able to do one run through the exhibits on my own then another with the docent. This allowed me to take in my own thoughts and emotions while still learning about the artists' original intentions."
