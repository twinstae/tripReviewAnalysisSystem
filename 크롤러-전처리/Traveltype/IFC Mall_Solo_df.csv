0,4.0,"Premium mall under the International Finance Centre (IFC) buildings next to Yeouido Park.  Connected to Yeouido Station and Conrad Hotel.  Many international and luxury brands (not really the place to come for a bargain...).  Large number and range of eateries, from coffee shops through to bars and restaurants.  Provides a good dining alternative if you are staying at the Conrad Seoul.  Beautifully maintained.  An apparently pets are allowed!"
1,5.0,"It might be located a bit off from common tourist destinations. Located in the business district quite close to the Assembly Hall and KBS. However, mall features good brands such as A/X, Mango(He/She), Zara, Guess and others. There are eating places at the basement along with the cineplexes. Good bargains during the festive seasons."
2,4.0,After work I often visit this place and watch movies or read and buy new books or buy clothes and always eat delicious food! This place is very convenient for fooling around doing nothing on holidays or after work! Always beneficial anyway.
3,4.0,Numerous options for shoppers and even food lovers. Nicely located close to subway station and there is a way to lead to Conrad Seoul hotel.A place for your to find brand shops and individual boutiques.Fun to be there!
4,3.0,"It's a good place to grab lunch or catch a movie but the stores are what you'd find in any euro/us shopping mall.. Mostly draws locals and other asians who have money to burn. I think the only korean brand here is Beanpole. They do have an electronics/book store. If you are a westener I would recommend Hongik univ, Ehwa womens univ or Myongdong instead.."
