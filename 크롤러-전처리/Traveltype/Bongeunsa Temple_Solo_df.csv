0,4.0,The temple isn’t just a tourist attraction but an actual active one. There are monks and worshippers at the temple so it is a real authentic Korean experience and worth a visit. Though the temple is located right within the business area on Gangnam-gu it is nice and quiet and an opportunity to relax and wind down.
1,5.0,This is an active temple with worshipers. The architecture is interesting and worth a visit. It will not take very long to visit the property.
2,5.0,"A random decision to book 2D1N temple stay in Seoul.  It's a journey of learning & experience Korean Buddhist culture w open mind regardless of religion , background.  Friendly & humble coach , Sunims , yoga teacher sharing their experiences n stories. Will definitely make this as part of future trip to Korea"
3,4.0,"From Seoul Station, I took the subway and made a transfer to line 9, which has an exit right by the temple. It was very easy to find. The entry is beautiful with many white lanterns, flowers, and sculpture. Once inside the grounds, I enjoyed taking photos of the temple buildings with the modern skyscrapers in the background. It is such a stark contrast. It is very peaceful and I highly recommend this peaceful respite."
4,5.0,I walked by at the end of my vacation in korea. The temple was very beautiful and they offers classes(?) to experience Buddhism. I wish I knew about this earlier.
5,5.0,Complex of small temples on a hillside opposite side of road to Coex conference centre and Coex Intercontinental Hotel. Beautiful displays of paper lanterns sponsored by worshippers. This is a large restoration site but done very sensitively to create a restful location in a busy city. Worth a visit as part of a Seoul trip.
6,5.0,"We visited one afternoon in June 2019 by chance. We were mesmerised by the thousands of coloured lanterns, the intricate and beautiful painting of buildings and the amazing plaza with hundreds of statues around a massive Buddha. Despite being in the centre of town it was very peaceful and spiritual. And  amazingly it was free. Highly recommended."
7,5.0,"I was here around sunset and really enjoyed it. The temple looked great, as it was still decorated for Buddha's birthday. It was very quiet too, almost no one there."
8,4.0,"I had a nice, quick, visit to this temple. I happened to be there when there was a lantern festival happening, so it was extra beautiful. All I did was wonder around since there isn’t any real directions or guides (at least that I saw), but that was enough to see the beautiful grounds and temple. Close to subway and other attractions. Would recommend stopping by if you are nearby."
9,4.0,"This temple is located not far from the metro. The temple is nice, calm and peaceful. There is a big Buddha in the temple. During spring, the cherry blossom and magnolia is blooming in the temple."
10,5.0,can accept temple stay in this templeno entrance feehas monks insidethey also have huge parking spaces
11,5.0,"This temple has so much more to offer than the more popular spots in Seoul.Gyeongbokgung Palace was just... big, while the Temple was wonderfully ornate and less crowded. I am so glad I went there."
12,4.0,This Buddhist temple is located in Gangnam district just across CoEx. It's a good example of an old structure meets modern buildings. The temple offers temple stay wherein foreigners can understand and experience what monks do in their daily lives. Nice place to visit and appreciate the structures and surroundings because its not often you can see something like this.
13,5.0,"You are an early riser tourist and looking for something to do. I would recommend Bongeunsa Temple which is located next to COEX Mall. It is being described as a millennial Buddhist temple that commands a rich history of over 1,200 years. Understand that they are opened at 3am and closes around 1000pm. No entrance fee at all.Boungeunsa Temple is a peaceful retreat that is nestled in the heart of one of the busiest location in Seoul. When you set foot at the entrance, it transports you into a distinctively different world. As foreigner, you can participate in the “templestay program” in experiencing traditional Korean Buddhist culture and practices.The location is easily accessible by public transport. There is an exit directly outside the temple. Most of the halls are well layout on forested hillside. The library is the oldest remaining building in the compound. It contains Avatamsaka Sutra woodblock cravings and over 3000 Buddhist scriptures.The main highlight of this historic Buddhist Zen temple is the 28 metres tall stone statute of Maitreya whom is the “Future Buddha”."
14,4.0,"I shared with 6 people in the thursday afternoon tour and it was very interesting. Clear explanation during a tour. Attent a session in the temple during prayers (very respectfully) and attent a drawing a drawing sessions that learnt you to meditateby focusing on drawing korean writing and a tea ceremony wit the same goal. The conversation with one of the monks was relaxing in itself. I had expected a full meditation session under guidance, but this was well compensated. Surely recommend this experience on an quiet island in the heart of modern Gangnam."
15,5.0,I didn't expect this temple to be as beautiful as it was. It's not too large but there's quite a bit to see which different sections as well as a staircase at the back leading to another area. The entrance to the temple is lined with lanterns and plants which makes for a great photo opportunity but don't forget to be respectful.
16,4.0,"It is a large complex, with a number of smaller shrines in the midst. The temple grounds are well maintained and do not seem to close, even late into the evening. It is just directly opposite the COEX exhibition centre so easy to get to."
17,5.0,Stumbled across Bongeunsa when visiting Gangnam - absolutely recommend visiting - beautiful grounds filled with lotus flowers and laterns - and the Buddha statutue is very impressive
18,5.0,Here is the  first time I come here. I cant imagine that there's a Buddha Temple in the middle of Seoul. The Temple is next to the Mall. The Temple is very quiet and the lanscape is tradional. I like many handle picture on the gates and walls. The Temple besides the moutain make me feel  so small. I'll come back this Temple on the future.
19,5.0,"A very beautiful place to relax, meditate and/or contemplate. I was there during a ceremony, and lucky enough i got to hear the monks chant and recitation. A very beautiful moment. It´s a strange feeling watching the skyscrapers (and all commercialism) surrounding this peaceful temple yard. There´s also a small buddhist shop beside the entrance where you can buy malas and gifts. Don´t miss this spiritual waterhole."
20,5.0,"Lovely temple complex in the southern part of Seoul, very quiet and peaceful. Templestay options are available"
21,4.0,This temple is just across our hotel by the Coex and it's almost a crime if you don't go visit it.  I find it very minimalistic but with nice and serene feel.  You can see people praying and meditating so that is very nice and real.
22,5.0,Love this place. Feel so relaxing just to look at all the beautiful flowers and colorful paper lanterns.
23,5.0,Bongeunsa Temple is comprised of multiple buildings. There are multi-lingual posters explaining the historical significance of each of the distinct areas. It was very pretty and peaceful. The entrance was free. This Temple is located across from Coex Mall.
24,5.0,"Wonderful Buddist temple they accept reservation for accommodation at the temple. Beautiful place and about a 15 minute walk from the Joseon Royal Tombs inscribed on the UNESCO world heritage list. Amazing art great for pictures took me about an hour to your the entire place, light walking great for meditating not very on Sunday there was light tourist and local public."
25,3.0,"Famous temple and it's more than 1,200 years old. Though partly damaged in the past, restoration work has mostly repaired it, and still going on. As a tourist site, they don't have much info about the place . locals come here for their prayersIt's just across the intercontinental coex where i stayed so it was convenient to get to"
26,5.0,Out of the way from other temples but worth it. Great place to spend and hour or so looking around. Very beautiful in every season even in the rain.
27,5.0,"This Buddhist temple is amazing! There are locals that go for prayers, so remember to be quiet and respectful to them. The architecture is beautiful and the goddess statue is magnificent! Definitely a place to stop by for a quiet and peaceful time."
28,4.0,I toured the Bongeunsa Temple on a guided tour on 10th October 2017. The Goddess of Mercy is a very pretty statue. There are also various buildings in this temple premises. I’m downloading photos to display Bongeunsa Temple.
29,5.0,"This was one of the places I always wanted to visit after seeing a photo of the temple with the sky line of Gangnam in the background. The temple is very easy to find and is located just across the road from COEX mall. I spent a good couple of hours here just exploring and admiring the stunning traditional architecture, hearing the chants coming from the main hall whilst sitting on the steps was very relaxing. I am not religious in anyway but I felt comforted here a thousands of miles away from home."
30,5.0,"Although quite a bit of a trek outside the main downtown area, the metro will whisk you here for the largest temple in the city. Some of the halls are quite new and others (mainly those hidden in the hills) are much older. Regardless, you need to remove your shoes to visit any of the shrines inside. The vast statue that dominates the hillside is the main attraction. Free to visit."
31,5.0,The Bongeunsa Temple is a place of history and is being renovated as I had a walk around. It is a great place of peace and tranquility in the midst of city center and opposite of the COEX mall. It has many small temples and a main one where there are prayers held apart from many other prayer hall. There is a large Buddha statue in the middle. It is dedicated to the Korean Buddhism sect and comes across as a great place to visit in the evening. Enjoy the wonderful place when in Seoul.
32,5.0,"I first went to visit the Coex (Giant Mall) and had to take a step out half way through because of the amount of people there. What did I find? Across the street this wonderful place that was quiet and with limited amount of people. The traditional style of the buildings, beautiful statues, and simple walking paths around the area. This was a peaceful (and fun) afternoon especially to escape the ""concrete jungle"" and to take a moment of refreshing calmness from the fast-paced lifestyle in Seoul. *As of Oct '17 - There was no entrance fee and no restroom fee*"
33,4.0,"Place is located in the always busy Gamnang area. Entrance is free, and the area is quite calm and nice. While for me Seoul seems as very western oriented country, it was good to be able to see actual old culture.Also place seems to be very popular for the koreans"
34,3.0,The temple is beautiful but unfortunately they are doing some renovation now and with the construction cite and the noise ....it makes it kind of hard to enjoy the peaceful place.
35,4.0,"The temple could not be missed when visiting Seoul. Just out of Exit 1 of Bongeunsa station was a beautiful temple located on a hill. The main entrance was impressive with hundred of mini lotus pond. Besides, the temple was decorated beautifully with thousands of white lanterns. Walking around and sitting silently, I found peace of mind to myself."
36,5.0,"Had joined the temple tour, held every Thursday 2 pm, 20,000 won. Its all worth it. Our Korean guide tried her very best to explain in English. Must do in Seoul."
37,3.0,A nice and peaceful temple in the middle of the city (like everything else in Seoul that is in the city....peaceful or not). People pray here so be quite. It was worth a visit...I like culture and history. I mindfulness I give this temple 4 of 5. The metro station has same name as the temple it self. Easy to get here.
38,5.0,A very quiet spiritual plave to visit.The Buddha was very special.The paintings were stunning too.
39,5.0,"I'm very serious about the following: this place might be one of the most peaceful places on earth!Whether Buddhist or not, you will find a place for relaxation and connection with yourself or whoever you believe in. Just make sure to follow and respect the common rules (such as shoe wearing in certain areas).I found quite interesting to see the contest between the traditional and spiritual that represents the complex and all the modernity that surrounded it."
40,5.0,"I visited this site on a quick visit to Seoul. I wanted to see a Buddhist temple and learn a little about Korean culture in general. I found this place absolutely stunning. The buildings are magnificent, the giant statue of the Buddha breath taking. I took my time to stroll around at my leisure and felt very relaxed, everyone is doing their thing so you can really explore freely. A wonderful visit if you are looking for a calm place."
41,4.0,It was a good short visit but i heard you can spend a night there during the weekends and learn about meditation. Cant verify it though.
42,4.0,When I went there were a number of lanterns around. The temple is small and by far the most impressive aspect is the very large standing Buddha at the back. I didn't meet too many monks or staff but the few I did meet were very friendly.
43,5.0,"Bongeunsa temple near the business center in the city center. Beautiful complex of Buddhist temples in a large park. Peace silence, people dedicated to prayer and a lot of tourists. Relax and enjoy the visit. During my visit could be seen and sculpture exhibition."
44,4.0,"""Quite mesmerizing"" was the sight of these rows of beautiful white paper lanterns overhead stretching from the entrance gate all the way to the first temple building raised up on concrete pillars, and more white paper lanterns along with red ones are to be seen in that building & the one right behind (pretty much connected to the first building) on the way to the inner temple grounds where all the way at the back is a great ""standing Buddha"" with a square-plate hat (a pretty ""unique"" design of a Buddha statue really!) on a pedestal with also big carved sculptures around its base.  Some views of the city from near the big Buddha (which is on somewhat of a high ground) are alright too although there's not much of a skyline to speak of in this area pretty far to the south of the city (across the wide Han River) from the hustle & bustle of the downtown area in the north in the vicinity of the palaces.  And yes, what's ""really great"" about this temple is that it stays open late; I only arrived at pretty close to 6 pm and they were still open (temples in Japan for example, from my experience, all close at about 5 pm) although a monk was hitting a gong or something inside a temple building at about 6 20 pm which I'm not sure was a signal for closing.Coming by subway, the nearest station is Bongeunsa Station (the same name as this temple) on Line 9, and it's a mere 3-minute-or-so walk to the temple entrance gate (with its four big guard statues) after getting out of the station."
45,3.0,"Unfortunately, greater Seoul has grown all around this old centre of Korean Buddhism. The grounds are quite spacioius (there's even a lovely wooded hill behind), but wherever you wander, you're never quite free from traffic noise.This is a functioning temple, not a mere tourist attraction, so parts of it are constantly being remodelled. It's not quite as ""romantic"" as one might hope.Nevertheless, it makes for an interesting visit, especially if you also cross the road to compare it with the COEX convention centre, a temple of another kind:  to globalisation and commerce.To get there take the metro to Bongeunsa station and follow the signs."
46,4.0,"Bongeunsa in Gangnam district,  is a temple highly popular with tourists. It is very easy to go there with a metro station (Bongeunsa) right at the door-step of Bongeunsa Temple. This temple is said to be the largest temple in Seoul during the Joseon Period. After the temple visit, Coex Mall is just across the road. With the largest under-ground Mall in Asia, it is a good place to shop and to dine. The other end of the Coex Mall is linked directly to another metro station where you can visit Unesco Royal Tombs. Thereafter, you have many shopping and sightseeing options."
47,4.0,"the templelife program allows you to follow the activities of the temple, take part in the guided tour within the temple, understand better Korean culture and buddhism, experience Korean tea ceremony and zen meditation."
48,5.0,"From the very entrance you could sense the seperation from the hustle and bustle of the surrounding neighborhood. When I visited there were renovation works, but the route was designed as serpent, when you go through a stunning looks of many lotuses. Take your time to visit the several pagodas, sit a while in silence while gazing at the breath taking ceililng or just watch the random worshippers pray. You could have a nice stroll between the halls, and might gat lucky to watch to monks praying their mantras. If you like, you can get souvenirs and buddhist religious artifacts from the shop in the entrance. Recommended!"
49,5.0,"The bongeun temple is next to the Coex in samsung-dong. It's the most biggest temple in seoul & has a long history. You take the line 2, off at Samsung station & exit 6. No entrance fee."
50,4.0,"Free admission and feel free to walk around the numerous buildings. I didn't go inside the buildings, since they were being used for services."
51,5.0,"For the attendee of any conference at Coex, it is difficult to miss this compound of temples.  It is right across the north entrance of Coex.  It is beautiful from the outside and impressive from the inside.  There is no entrance fee.  A small buddhist store and a volunteer tour guide's tent are right at the entrance.  I opted not to get a tour guide because my intention was some silent reflection. There was a ""service"" going on when I visited.  There was a prayer leader leading a group of practitioners in song and meditation.  The music/singing  could be heard throughout the temple grounds but it did not preclude silent reflection as the music was conducive to it.  There were many people tendingto the gardens and ponds when I was there.  I do not know if this is a daily thing or just a coincidence.  The grounds are very well kept.  Some of the trees looked really old.  The pond with the lotus flowers was lovely.  They don't mind tourists taking pictures as long as this is done quietly and unobtrusively.  I highly recommend a visit."
52,5.0,"It has many areas for praying and it has the biggest buddha sculpture. Traditionally you should bring some food to the temple as a part of the praying. People generally bring a bottle of water or rice but you can get creative (your country's famous biscuit for example) When you are there dont judge and dont talk so loudly please. Explore, have fun, have the bliss!"
53,4.0,"I was in Seoul on an official trip and had some of my colleagues with me. I had meeting in COEX which is a mall and has many a things like offices, the famous coex aquarium, branded shops, etc in it. I was very interested to visit the Bonguensa Temple as I love to visit the religious places of different religions and country. I like to see how in other countries the Lord is worshipped. Hence, I decided to visit this place which was very near to the COEX Mall. My colleagues chose to keep visiting the mall. The moment I stepped into this place it was very calm and a divine feel was coming. In the entrance there were lotus plants every where and the God was also being offered Lotus. The local people were buying grains and other things to offer the God. I went there in the evening and that time the monk was offering the prayers and then he rang the big bell. The sound of it was giving peace to me. I saw how the locals are offering prayers and then did the same way. In the premises of the temple there was a garden, a place where the monks stay, a very big statue of the Gautam Buddha and there was a Goddess also who was resembling our Indian Godess. The place was very beautiful and calm. A must visit if you are around the place."
54,4.0,"Nice area to visit the history of Korea in the middle of Seoul Metropolitan. Active Temple, so please be respectful while you are there as services are always being held.  Great place to visit for an hour."
55,5.0,"Over 1,200 years of historical BUDDHIST temple in Seoul, dignified the long journey of Buddhism was introduced to Korea. Very well preserved ancient wooden flooring and building structures. Most of all, a treasure of the 1st edition of Avatamsaka Sutra in wooden blocks were well preserved here."
56,4.0,"The temple itself would deserve 5 stars. It's very beautifull, but when I was there their was construction work next to it. So the noise disrubted the piece and tranquil place."
57,5.0,This is a nice temple located directly across the road opposite COEX mall. This heritage temple is a nice attraction for those who is keen to know Korean Buddhism culture.
58,4.0,I was at a conference across the street at COEX and this was my first attraction to visit in the city.  The layout of the temple was similar to another temple I had visited but the buildings were all their own.  I loved seeing the daily rituals of the temple going on around me as I walked the grounds.  The lanterns everywhere were beautiful and the entrance with all the lotus flowers in the big wooden pots were beautiful too.  I forgot I was in a big city for a bit!
59,4.0,"An over 1200 years historical Buddhist temple.  Unfortunately, most of the buildings were ruined or burnt.  The current architectures were rebuilt after the Korea War. Behind the main hall, there is a newly erected (1996), 23 meter tall statue of the Maitreya Buddha. The temple provides religion related activities for tourists-- meditation, temple stay program,…etc. A nice place for Buddhists and temple lovers."
60,4.0,"If you are in the vicinity of COEX in Seoul, I highly recommend visiting the nearby Bongeunsa Temple, located across from the main COEX convention center and conveniently located off the metro line 9 stop with the same name.  I visited on a Sunday morning and the place was full of worshippers.  While I did not enter any of the buildings where the services were taking place, it was nice to hear the drums and chants of the people at these services as I wandered around and took pictures. The architecture and paintings on the buildings were interesting and there was information in various languages, to include English.  They offer temple stays if you are in to things like that.  There also is a large out door central area with a big statue and cushions where one can pay their own respects.  It was very peaceful and beautiful.  Altogether I am very happy I visited and would recommend visitors to Seoul check it out, especially if attending something or shopping/eating/going to the aquarium at the nearby COEX.  About an hour is sufficient to view the complex, more if you sit and soak in the atmosphere."
61,3.0,"Visited Bongeunsa whilst attending a conference at COEX across the road. A welcoem respite to the activity of the conference.When I visited the way into the temple was between a path of water lilies in large barrels up to the first Hall - and as this is a working Bhuddist temple the hall was full of devotees chanting as where the other halls around the site. The different halls are architectural Korean buildings in their own right with highly decorated exteriors and interiors. There were lots of messages for the Gods hanging like an upside down carpet between some of the buildings, incense and shops to buy food for the Gods.There is also a bell and large drum pavilions, a large open air statue and if you wish to do so you can book to stay here and experience the life of a monk. An hour or so will allow to enjoy the pleasures of this temple"
62,5.0,This was an amazing temple.  When I went the temple was getting ready for Buddha's Birthday celebration so there were a lot of visitors and a lot of action.  it was beautiful and very peaceful.
63,5.0,An easy stroll from the metro finds you at this classic temple. Do visit any time but especially during the lantern festival.
64,5.0,"I was very fortunate to visit Seoul just in time for Buddha's birthday. Hence the entire city was decorated in festive lanterns and lights. Bongeunsa Temple is situated very close to Gangnam, right across the street from the COEX Mall, and just a few blocks walk from the Park Hyatt, where I was staying. The temple staff are very polite, and I was treated to a wonderful volunteer led tour of the temple grounds with other English speaking tourists. They also had a number of fun celebratory activities, but also host a Temple Stay program as well as a day program on Thursday afternoons for tourists interested in learning more about Buddhism for a small fee (something like 20 USD). Highly recommended if you are in the area."
65,5.0,"I've been to a few temples and this one is my favourite, it is so peaceful and you really feel like the spirits are there with you.Well worth the visit."
66,4.0,"I loved this temple, although in Asia all the temples are similar, but this one was different and was very peaceful, I loved watching people pray there, and took a lot of amazing pictures."
67,3.0,"There is a big Buddha, and it´s quite calm. If you are only in Seoul and can´t visit any temple in any of the several mountains, that it´s a nice location. It´s also special that it is in the middle of the metropolitan city."
68,4.0,"Relatively easy to find, best to use the COEX exit as the temple is just across the road.  Chantings was going on as part of the pre Wesak celebrations, lanterns were strung up.   Wesak day celebration is a biggie in Seoul. There are a number of buildings including the main hall sprawled around the temple grounds.  A must visit is the huge stone standing Matrieya Buddha, you can do some meditation in front of the statue."
69,4.0,"I was there a few weeks before Buddha's birthday.  All the colourful lanterns were hung up and it was beautiful.  The lilac trees were in bloom.  Unfortunately due to the workers it was very dusty and noisy when I was there.  On any other occasion, i'm sure the place would be quite tranquil."
70,5.0,I was staying across the street and went into this temple. I was so moved by its beauty. It was so beautiful and peaceful. I recommend everyone go and walk through. Also make a small donation so they can continue their work. So amazing.
71,4.0,Spent about 30 minutes walking the grounds and enjoying the peace and quiet away from the crowds. Did a little prayer too. Cherry blossoms were aplenty when I was there. I wish I had the time to do a temple stay program.
72,4.0,"Went here this morning to kill some time and it was very peaceful.   The architecture was very cool.  It's amazing that this place is in the middle of a very busy city.  If you are on the arwa, you should stop by, you only need about an hour and it's free."
73,5.0,I visited in early April just as the blossom was starting to bloom. The grounds were beautiful. The whole place is very peaceful and spiritual as it is an active temple. Looking out over the city from above the Buddha gives a great view.
74,5.0,"First, it is free.  Second, this is a little oasis in the middle of Seoul.  Buddhist chants are heard throughout the site.  Blossoms on the trees, with the dullness of the rest of the grounds, adds a pretty contrast."
75,4.0,"If you are in Seoul, then don't miss this. You would get a very good glimpse of Korean history and ancient architecture! Also this is at the downtown, so don't miss the hot stream which is walkable from this place. It's reachable via Seoul metro!"
76,5.0,I visited the temple primarily because it was opposite the COEX where I was attending an event. Due to its location being surrounded by lots of modern offices etc. I was expecting much but it was very enjoyable. The gardens were nice to walk around and some of the construction of the buildings appeared very old which was interesting to look at.
77,5.0,"This Buddhist Temple was right across the street from my hotel.  There was no charge to enter the temple grounds, but there was box from donations and a gift shop.  It is an active temple with services run on a regular basis during the day.  It had a several interesting buildings and a brochure for a self guided tour.  I was careful to be respectful of the worshipers and the holy buildings during my visit.  It was very impressive and I would recommend it if one is staying in the area."
78,5.0,"Lived in Seoul for three years and this temple is my favorites of all in the city. Right across from the COEX mall, you can see the two worlds co-existing in harmony. Free to all but donations are greatly appreciated. Please show respect when on the temple ground. Dress properly and remove all footwear when entering prayer rooms."
79,5.0,"Bongeunsa is the head temple for Seon Buddhism in Seoul.  It is a very peaceful place, surrounded by the skyscrapers and busy streets of Seoul. Would definitely recommend a visit on a sunny and calm day, and spend time walking around the grounds."
80,5.0,"Beautiful Buddhist temple in the heart of Seoul, surrounded by skyscrapers but still a relaxing place. Entrance is free and it really worths the visit."
81,5.0,"DATE VISITED: November 15, 2014PROS: Astounding place, beautiful sight, a bit peaceful (if you want some break from busy Seoul). Huge place!CONS: Nothing much, just put this sight on your list of places while in Seoul and you won't regret it.LOCATION: 5/5PRICE: 5/5HOSPITALITY: 4/5ATTRACTIONS: 4/5"
82,3.0,"I took a chance to visit the place in the evening, after all the palaces and shops have closed. However, it was too dark to see anything. At least from outside. It is far from everything, except if you stay nearby. A bit dissapointing."
83,4.0,Beautiful temple situated just next to the COEX Hotel / Shopping Complex. Free to visit. Many different areas to wander around. Has various ceremonies at different times.
84,5.0,"Calm and serene place in heart of the  city, rather s walk from the business center. The temple is very pretty and spread around in a big area. I went there in the evening and enjoyed walking around in the temple and seeing the evening rituals."
85,5.0,"Pronounced 'Bong uun sa' this temple complex lies on the south side of the river dividing Seoul and is almost a hidden oasis of peace threatening at any time to be swallowed up by the tall techno-scrapers surrounding it on all sides.  even the 70-ft high standing Buddha statue is hidden from city view.  This complex is home to the Korean style of Buddhism and has been here for over a thousand years.Walking through the main gate you are greeted by carefully crafted tree and shrub arrangements with streams, and the first temple is in front of you.  There are twelve others, and when I was there, a religious ceremony was taking place.  No wonder so many people were praying for peace - the North Korean ultimatum ha just 2 more hours to run before it expired.On an upward slope with the statue of Buddha crowning the site, this complex simply radiates serenity, peace and calm.  My photographs do it little justice.  The complex has a supernatural capacity to shut out the noise of Seoul City, so that the visitor at once feels calm and rested as you walk through the glades and around the variously sized temples.This really is a 'must see, must experience'.  It is tricky to get to from Downtown, as you need to change on the south side of the river.  But it is definitely worth it, far more than the more tourist-packed temple near the Downtown area of the northern half of Seoul."
86,4.0,"Whilst attending a convention at Coex, I could look out at this temple. It looked so serene that I escaped the conference for 40 minutes to visit it. Amazingly a quiet oasis right beside a busy 8 lane major road. Just walking around this temple, which is still being used, was a delight. Calm and serene you could understand why people still prayed there. Lovely buildings to view and wander the grounds peacefully."
87,5.0,"I had the opportunity to do the Temple Life program at Bongenunsa Temple (wish I had more time to do the Temple Stay.)  It was an awesome experience - tour of the temple, learning to meditate, made lotus lanterns and had tea ceremony with a Buddhist Nun.  Before the program I walked around the Temple on my own for hours and saw the beautiful lanterns on display for the upcoming Lotus Lantern Festival.  It was a peaceful, calm area in the middle of Seoul"
88,5.0,"It's easy to grab lunch at Coex and then head over to this lovely temple. It really has it all, beautiful nature, a giant statue of Buddha, lovely architecture, the works. Definitely make a stop here."
89,5.0,Be prepared to tap into your spiritual side.  This temple is well maintained and is part of a program called TempleStay.  You can opt to stay and participate in the religious routine by selecting a program that fits your schedule.  Views are spectacular.  In walking distance from Coex Mall.
90,5.0,"Going to Bongeunsa was odd as took a tour through Gangnam. Lots of traffic. Temple was closed for a ceremony, but our tour guide managed to get us in. Once inside, you can see why it's a popular place to visit. Beautiful grounds and so peaceful. Strange to believe with all the traffic on the other side of the fence. A flying visit, but well worth it."
91,5.0,This is a beautiful temple in Seoul and easy to get to by metro. Our highlight was having traditional tea in the temple. There is no fee but if you would like to give a donation you can. The hostess was very nice and spoke english and explained the process of traditionally serving tea.
92,3.0,"Went there during the night time at around 8pm after a whole day downtown. The lantern and light decorations were beautiful. But the main reason to being there is also to visit a very old temple. During the night time the pathways were poorly lighted up and the temple, surrounding areas, statues were poorly lighted up. You will need a very good camera with good flash to capture it. Best visited during the daytime. If you planned to visit early in the morning; they are already open from 3am! And by 5am, Seoul would have been quite bright during summer time."
93,5.0,"I'd spent a few days wearing myself out at a conference and shopping binge before I fonud this place and it was just the thing I needed. I didn't book a tour, just went in and walked around. It didn't cost anything. I sat and meditated in the hall (shoes off) for a while with some other ladies and scored some traditional Korean cake that tasted very buddhist, ie. of nothing! Still, it was a really touching thing to be given something by a stranger in that quiet friendly space. Up behind the main hall is a series of dirt paths through a small grove of trees. It's pretty and feels like you are out of the city even if you can still hear it. The gardens closer to the temples are lovely and still under construction. When I was there it was spring and the cherry blossom had just fallen and was carpeting sections of the temple like snow.It is literally just outside and across the road from the COEX centre, so if you're there on work I recommend taking the time to stroll over to this restorative place."
94,4.0,Peaceful to walk around and not so crowded.Nice architecture and sculptures. Nice Gardens and cherry blossom.
95,5.0,"A calm temple in the center of the Gangnam. It was amazing to feel such tranquility in the center of the city. I practice yoga often, so it was quite an experience to visit such a special place and watch people take time to meditate in their day. Beautiful gardens, a must see."
96,5.0,"I actually visited here in April of 2014 (but it's not letting me select back that far).  It's located in Gangnam, across from the Coex mall.  It's a lovely escape from the bustling city right outside it's temple walls.  It's a beautiful temple, definitely worth a visit.  There's also a gift shop in the front with a lot of buddhist type gifts.  If visiting temples is your thing, check this one out."
97,4.0,"Very big and beautiful.  It is very active very touristy also.  Set it the middle of the city it provides beautiful pictures, but you won't get much of a traditional feel as everything looks new and well-kept.  Not a quiet place for contemplation."
98,4.0,"C1 ( 2015.04.01 ) I visited there because my appointment with my friend delayed near Bongeunsa, So I went in temple and enjoy having time to spare. This temple was located near downtown Seoul. By contrast, general Buddism temple was located in the mountains. This temple's atmosphere was very calm and reverent. I liked Buddism temple's atmosphere, view, scent. There was big statue of the Buddha, and some Korean traditional temple structures. Not big temple, but beautiful place."
99,4.0,"It is a Korean Buddhism Temple situated in front of  Coex, a huge shopping center and Intercontinental Hotel."
100,5.0,"I visited this location just after checking out to COEX mall and it is fantastic! It is preserved amazingly and it is still being used as an active temple, so you will see people going to pray. There was also a cherry blossom tree there, first one ive seen all week in Seoul so far. You can also purchase some souvenirs at the shop, they are reasonably priced."
101,4.0,"""Are you a Buddhist?"" , the girl at the information counter asked seeing I was wearing beads that were given by a Chinese friend. Finally, I had the chance of visiting this Buddhist temple across the Coex Interrcon. Long before this part of Seoul was developed before Seoul hosted the 1988 Olympics, this temple stood to provide a place for meditation. Now, it appears to be an anomaly in the husle and bustle of Gangnam. A great place to escape the city... Chanting monks, age- old painting and structures, a bell.. a temple stay is available too."
102,5.0,"I visit this temple every time I am in seoul. First time I barely found it after getting lost and ending up in the high school above it. This time I bought a candle for my mom. There was a decent wind blowing, but there were candle helpers there to get the candle lit and placed properly. Only other place I have done this is St. Patricks Cathedral in NYC. There I was presumed to be a threat and my backpack was searched. Here...I had help and was not treated as a threat. Very nice."
103,5.0,"It's surprising how peaceful it is here despite it being right in the middle of the city. I visited once by chance as I was passing by and liked it so much I went back for their one day temple stay. We made traditional tea, meditated and made lotus lanterns - a great insight if you don't have a couple of days to give to a temple stay or if you're not sure how you feel about 4am meditation and hours of silence!"
104,5.0,"Beautiful temple in the city.  The temple is part of a larger complex with several buildings, fountains, and statues to check out.  After spending time looking around the complex, I took off my shoes, went inside, grabbed a mat and sat down.  There was an interesting mix of people inside--toward the front of the temple closest to the statues were those who came to pray, around the sides were mainly tourists, and along the back wall were people who appeared to come to spend the afternoon; some were reading, some were clipping coupons, some were doing their bills and chatting.  I got the feeling that the temple is really a gathering place and I was happy to be a part of it."
105,5.0,"Bongeunsa Temple, located near the COEX mall, in Gangnam-gu, dates from the 8th century and has been very well maintained to this day. I visited in the afternoon on a weekday when it was quiet and uncrowded. There were beautiful red lanterns being put up in the Dharma King Pavilion. The Main Buddha Hall (Building no. 5) is especially beautiful and peaceful. Do spend at least a few minutes inside this hall, perhaps meditating. One can observe other worshipers chanting, praying or bowing to the Buddha, and it is very peaceful to hear the chants.The huge 23 meter statue of the Maitreya Buddha is very impressive to behold. Also recommended is the Statue of Bodhisattva of Compassion by the Water. Separately, the temple also offers a templestay program (2 nights' stay) for KRW 70,000 and a templelife program (2 hours on Thursday) for KRW 20,000 which could be interesting to those keen on learning more about Korean Buddhism.The tranquil and peaceful temple aura makes this a must-visit temple in Seoul!"
106,5.0,"It was rather amusing and fascinating. Didn't really know such place existed until I saw this but wow was I impressed. It's quite big and even thou I'm not into religion, it is something that people should appreciate anyways.https://plus.google.com/u/4/b/106023067131637354979/106023067131637354979/posts"
107,4.0,It can be seen right across the north gate of COEX with the towering statue of Buddha. It is one of the 14 major Buddhist temples in Korea & one of the oldest with 1000 year history. The shrines & halls of the temple are spread  on a forested hillside..This is a must-see attraction when in Seoul.
108,5.0,"I am not a Buddhist, but I was enthralled by this temple. The display of flower offerings are particularly beautiful and the grounds well kept. You can walk from one building to another among beautiful gardens. It's a tranquil place."
109,4.0,"A large and peaceful buddhist temple in the middle of chaotic Gangnam area. It is like an oasis. If you visit the temple around 11.30 a.m., don't forget to buy a lunch at the temple for just 1000 KRW."
110,3.0,"Bongeunsa Temple is a little far out from the usual tourist spots in Gangnam. If Gangnam is not in your itinerary, there isn't much to convince you to go out of your way for it either. There are some interesting views from the temple due to its land area size. Another plus point is that there is no entrance fee. However, there are far more interesting locations and sights in Seoul if architectures and cultural-related sites are off your interest."
111,5.0,"I had a wonderful day here. I read about the two hour program (which, due to Russian speaking and Japanese speaking small groups joining toward the end, using translators, turned into closer to three hours). It is offered on Thursdays a  ""temple life program."" Our guide was lovely and very informative. When you walk by a temple which is not spectacularly ornate or is located in nature and serene, it is sometimes easy to overlook so much that has meaning. She explained Korean culture and Buddhism and architecture in a way that was simple and helpful. There were some activities such as walking the temple grounds and learning about the various buildings, a Korean tea ceremony which we took part in, a brief meditation introduction, and a creative little paper lotus lantern making class. Truly an excellent experience here."
112,4.0,This temple is situated in a new highly-built up area of Seoul and was a beautiful contrast. The entire area was beautiful and I really enjoyed walking the paths that were lined with lanterns. The huge Buddha statue at the back of the temple was also very impressive. Highly recommended as a place to visit while in Seoul.
113,5.0,"Visit during the evening hours, the views are breathtaking! One of the most beautiful buddhist temples I have ever been to."
114,5.0,"This temple was easy to find and once inside, you forget about the noisy city all around it.  The shrines were beautiful and the grounds were filled with lanterns, vegetation, and water. This is a must do if in Samseong and visiting other sites like the Coex and aquarium.  Be sure to visit the gift shop just outside of the temple with the nicest older couple you could ever want to meet."
115,5.0,"You can see the temple from the gym of the Intercontinental Coex hotel so there was no excuse for me not to take a look. There is no entrance fee and they have brochures in English explaining everything.What made it particularly interesting to me is that it's actively being used. That is to say that it isn't like a museum where you just look at something that's been around a long time. People were actively coming and going meditating or praying. Some of the buildings, or halls, have very intricate paintings and statues.Had I made a special trip just to see the temple from further away I may have only given it 4 stars since you can see everything in under an hour. But since it was close to my hotel and free 5 stars seems about right."
116,5.0,"Bonguensa is a lovely place to visit as it provides a break from the hussle of the city. This simple temple overlooking the Coex Mall, is one which you can go around it on your own and appreciate the lovely structures and history. During my visit, there was a large crowd performing prayer rituals and was an interesting experience. There is a majestic Buddha overlooking the busy streets and was quite an impressive sight."
117,5.0,went there on the celebration of Buddha's b'day and it was so beautiful and peaceful there.. so many lanterns were there decorating the temple..
118,4.0,"Bongeunsa is beautiful, quiet and easily accessible from Samseong Station Exit 6 (Come out of the exit and keep walking until you reach a major junction, then turn left and keep walking until you see it on your right). Alternatively you can come out of COEX Mall but I cannot really explain that way (I always manage by accident).On my first visit to Bongeunsa, there was a lady who spoke some English at the Information Centre. It was funny because she was speaking English to me and I was replying in Korean! They offer Templestay in English and Korean only. The various shrines inside Bongeunsa are simple and practical. Some of them have information boards to explain the shrines, most of them have mats for worshippers to kneel on and pray. Do remember to close the doors if you do enter the shrines as the noise and light from outside may disturb the others in prayers.I went in spring during the cherry blossom season. I encourage everyone to visit during that time. The hillslopes around Bongeunsa were covered with white or pink cherry blossom petals and it was truly beautiful to see. [I would go on about this really handsome and kind guy I saw praying... but that is another story...]On my second visit, I went in early summer (ok earlier this week, in fact) with my mum, who is a vegetarian. This time we also visited the thrift store near the entrance, where I bought a small sling bag. Items are really cheap in the thrift store if you don't mind browsing a bit.We also visited the cafe. Unfortunately, this cafe isn't a vegan cafe. Some of the items on the menu do include eggs as ingredients. Please do check with the staff, some of them speak English. The cafe does have a variety of travel booklets for free and they serve traditional Korean teas. Some of the dry food stuff they sell are also not vegetarian nor vegan, so do check with the staff when in doubt. On the whole, my mum and I liked it a lot. We really did. If the cafe were a vegetarian/vegan cafe, it would be even better. =)"
119,4.0,"A woderful palace to walk aroound and explore..most all museums, palaces etc. are closed on Monday..check first"
120,5.0,Great place to go for a time out and reflect on the other things of life. Very peaceful place and chanting from the monks sets a good rhythm
121,4.0,"I'm only giving 4 stars instead of 5 because I didn't have enough time to see the entire complex.  The entrance is beautiful.  There was a prayer service in place when I was there, and even seeing the full to capacity building was very moving.  The huge Buddha statue is a sight to see.  But the best sight is seeing the temple and the complex against the very modern architecture of Gangnam. I wish I had enough time to walk through the entire grounds.  As my brother visited this place on a separate day, he said that this was the best highlight of our family Seoul vacation, and he stayed in Seoul for 2 weeks.  He said that there is a 2.5 hour tour which included the history of Buddhism, a tea ceremony, along with a meditation class!  I hope this helps those of you who are considering visiting this temple because if I had the opportunity and time, I would absolutely jump at the chance to take the tour that my brother did."
122,4.0,"A truly wonderful place. very peacful to visit if you wanna escape the busy city life of seoul, its nestled near coex mall and its quite a lovely Gem of Korean history. Check it out. No fee. Just enjoy the peacuflul temple."
123,4.0,"Having been to Seoul several times, I had seen most of the marquis sites. I was in Gangnam this time and found the description of this Temple on TripAdvisor. I was intrigued concerning this institution that had roots going back 1200 years. In looking at the website, I was confused as it almost looked as though you had to make reservations to tour the grounds. But the reservations were strictly for the guided teaching/experience tours on Thursdays (which might have been interesting if I thought I could have fit it into my itinerary). There is also a two night overnight experience that looks like it would be good for those who want to take an in-depth dive into the Zen order that operates this temple. As it turned out, the grounds were indeed open to simply stroll. The location was interesting as the peaceful setting was striking and yet I did not lose awareness by any means that I was in urban surroundings. That contrast was unusual. When walking in, there was a free brochure available that pointed out the highlights of the grounds. There was a worship ceremony taking place at the time I was there, which was interesting to witness. The grounds themselves were very nice and the buildings were lovely from an architectural perspective. I was a little surprised to see the number of Buddhist followers who visited the Temple while I was there, many of whom appeared very devout. The highlight of the facilities for me was the 23-meter tall Statue of the Maitreya Buddha. The faith holds that this Buddha will come to earth to save those beings who are suffering. This statue was apparently carried from Jeolla Province to be placed here. I would recommend taking a stroll through these grounds if you have the time. You will find the atmosphere to be peaceful, the architecture interesting and you will have the chance to learn a little about Korean Buddhism. And it's free!!"
124,4.0,"For a country like South Korea, which is pretty known for its lavish high rises and technology, seeing a temple in the middle of Samseong-dong is like a breath of fresh air. Everything is peaceful and I can definitely see their dedication to their beliefs even I don't share the same religion as them."
125,5.0,"I walked to Bongeunsa on my first day staying in Gangnam.  After getting lost in the maze that is Coex across the street, this absolutely made my day. I only took a walk around the grounds and watched the prayer session, but I am very glad I found my way there and experienced it.  Also a great small gift shop near the entrance."
126,5.0,"Beautiful!!! If you go to the café try the cold plum tea. One of the best things I tasted in Seoul. The mini rolls were good too a bit fruitcakeish, my spouse had the walnut tart, also good. The bathroom was clean and interesting. A little bit hard to find. I personally don't much like the Gangnam district. I prefer old stuff."
127,5.0,"I went to a conference in COEX - which is right beside Bongeunsa - and could only visit the temple after the conference finished, around 7 pm. Being used to Japan, where every temple close early, I thought I'd never be able to see it. However, I was wrong! All temple halls are open until at least 9 pm, when they start closing it. The main hall stays open until 10:30 pm!! There is no entrance fee, you can just go in and explore the grounds by yourself, and also enter the main halls and catch a glimpse of the Korean practice of the 108 bows (there were so many people there!), or even take a cushion and try a little bit of zazen by yourself. The temple is gorgeous, and very well conserved. All statues were clean, the wooden floor shining, and the temple was full of beautiful paper lanterns when I visited. It was, definitely, one of the highlights of the trip! I love visiting temples and churches, and this one was - by far - the best of all."
128,5.0,"As you enter you can donate to help them, on the right is a food shop.  photos allowed but not inside any buildings, keep out of peoples way that are praying.  everyone was helpful in explaining what things were for and how the were used. you can see it all in under 2 hours."
129,5.0,"What an amazing temple. Although I am not Buddhist, I could feel the spirituality. While I enjoyed observing Koreans engage in rituals, I also felt that I was intruding. Be sure to bring a pair of socks because it is custom to take off your shoes when entering the temples."
130,3.0,"I found this place to be very lovely, but it was so hot the day we went that I was dehydrated from all the walking. This place is a 1200 year old buddhist temple and even though Buddhism is not my religion I can still respect a place of worship for it's beauty and historical aspects. There isn't much to do here unless you are Buddhist, but I will say that I felt very much out of place. The majority of the time that I was there (maybe one hour) I felt that we should not be there. It was almost as if we were invading someones home while they were showering. It was just that uncomfortable to be walking around while people prayed and meditated. Maybe it's just me, but that's the vibe that was felt. I will say that the statues and art on the walls are lovely. I think if you come here, come with a group of friends so you can have someone to talk to because as I said...there's nothing to really do unless you are Buddhist."
131,5.0,"A Budhist temple, free entrance, every time full of people  practicing your rites and worship and tourist sometimes disrespectful"
132,5.0,"located just across the conference venue, convenient to visit during breaks, we had a very friendly vollunteer who explained everything to us. the white and red flags,and the countless golden statuets of Budha were awesome"
133,5.0,"This is a beautiful temple, and I like the big statue of Buddha at the back of the temple. It is not far from the Coex mall and Seoul world trade center.  I first saw this temple in a Korean drama and always wanted to visit it. I visited during the Lotus Lantern festival so it was vibrant and full of colors. It also has lovely flower gardens, and I liked walking around the temple. From the temple, you can see the architecture of modern Seoul against the older one in the Temple. You will also see people worshiping in front of the statues. I recommend visiting this temple when in Seoul."
134,5.0,"This is a big temple located in Gangnam area very close to Coex mall. But you walk in and it feels like you have been lifted out of the busy Gangnam area, surrounded by trees, sound of water streaming along the side, chants from the main temple, the aroma of incense sticks wafting around.  Temple architecture seemed a bit similar to that of the palace, if you have already been to the Gyeongbuk palace! But its a great place to sit down and meditate or just enjoy a quiet, peaceful walk around the temple!"
135,5.0,"If there is one temple you want to visit, this is it. Only one long block from the subway station. Even though it is surrounded by tall building, but you won't feel being crowded. Utilize the English tour guide, be interactive, and they will share their belive with you. Even if you are not a beliver, be there around 10:00 am and join in with the prayer session at different parts of the temple, your soul will thank you for that."
136,5.0,"The Temple is Just across COEX , how can one , not drop by to see the beautiful buddhist works there ;) Plus , it was the locale of Lee Min Ho's Faith drama."
137,5.0,"Very spiritual place. It worth your time to come there in the evening in a candle light, sit down somewehere near the statue and observe the silence, feel the waves of people's prayers. Don't forget to ring the big bell and drink some water out of  small local fountains and make a wish."
138,5.0,Bongeunsa is a small but wonderfully peaceful Temple in the heart of busy bustling Seoul. It is near the Coex mall in Gangnam. It occupies a smallish area with lots of different buildings and a large Buddha. You can find real peace and tranquility here and it is a working temple which makes it feel even more relaxed. There weren't too many tourists when I went and you can spend time contemplating and enjoying the site in relative calm.The juxtaposition of the temple with tall buildings and busy roads make it the nicest sight I saw in Seoul. I also enjoyed the spiritual side of it and wandered around for a few hours.
139,4.0,"The Bongeunsa Temple in Seoul is a lovely stop in a vibrant city.  The temple grounds were undergoing renovations at the time of my visit, but it did not distract from the sense of peace and tranquility.  There were colorful lanterns strung throughout the grounds, and the buildings themselves are gorgeous works of art.  The woodcraft and artwork are amazing.  It is an active site of worship, so plan for a contemplative and quiet stop, but you will be rewarded by the beautiful blooming trees and lovely sights."
