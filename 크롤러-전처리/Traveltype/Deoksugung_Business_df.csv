0,4.0,"Make sure to include this in your itinerary.Walking through the palace corridors, absorbing the rich history and imagining being there as well."
1,4.0,"Part of your combination ticket, this palace is similar to the others (closed Mondays). Dunkin' Donuts is next door if you are cold and need a coffee to warm up."
2,3.0,"Very convenient to the CBD area and a short walk from some of the major hotels.  Lacks information and signage to give a feel for how the place looked in its prime and how the place was used.  Odd collection of buildings of various ages, some in traditional style and some in ""western"" (read brutalist ugly) style.  Worth a visit, but 30 minutes probably all you need"
3,4.0,"I stayed in The Plaza Hotel so it is very easy for me to reach this palace. The buildings are well preserved and incredibly beautiful, exactly like what you see on the dramas or movies. Definitely clean and tidy in every corner of the complex. Too bad I only spent less than 1 hour in this place. I will advice you to spend at least 2 hours in order to really enjoy your moment there. It has particular times where you can see the traditional dance performance and palace guards' shift-changing ritual."
4,5.0,"Subject: DeoksugungLocation: Seoul, South Korea, AsiaTitle: Deoksugung Palace - a snapshot into South Korea's historyID#: 443966790A tour of this palace is a must. The English tour guide was knowledgeable, enthused and provided an overview in a manner that encouraged questions, allowing you to feel the Palace and hear the different spaces. For those of us who need to see, hear and read, the pamphlet available is well written and outlines in details the different Courts and Halls as well as the different time periods and what was taking place. With this being my first time to Seoul, it was a great introduction. Because it was a group of us, we made reservations to be hosted by a English speaking tour guide. And yes there is a small entrance fee. I hesitate to quote the amount here as who knows when it may change."
