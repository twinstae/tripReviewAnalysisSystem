0,5.0,"We spent time here as part of our hop off, hop on City tour and really enjoyed exploring the various areas of the park."
1,4.0,"The park is very very big and clean. Saw mostly locals there, many with kids or elders. Nice place to walk around and enjoy the nature. Original purpose was to look for flower beds but couldn't find. Walking up to the tallest hill there can have a good view around too."
2,5.0,We went there to see the SOMA museum in 30 minutes. We spent 90 minutes look at all the statues outside in the park.
3,5.0,"We visited on a fine autumn day. Autumn foliage was everywhere and made the park so beautiful. It is a big place, so it does not feel crowded. We started from the Mongchontoseong Station and took a nice walk at the road beside the park to enjoy the yellow  trees there. Then we went back into the park towards the Peace Gate. While looking for cosmos flowers at the Wild Flowers Garden, I stumbled upon a field of beautiful pink muhly flowers instead and was so thrilled!"
4,5.0,"We visited this park and easily could've spent the day wandering around but instead it was just a long morning but we did not get to see everything we wanted. With the fall foliage, this park is gorgeous and clean. They had some fitness classes going on during the time we were there as well as kids learning to skate. It was fun to people watch as music played from the speakers. We wish we could've stopped here one more time for a stroll before we left."
5,4.0,We went there on a weekday and the park was not crowded. The park is so large and it needs hours to walk. It is advised to wear good walking or jogging shoes.Pay attention to the lovely rabbits. You may find a few jumping around somewhere in the park!
6,5.0,"We arrived on an incredibly hot day, hoping to see everything before the afternoon heat came! We picked a day when it was already full of school trips at 10am - ir is that everyday? It was top of my list to see and well worth it. View of the Lotte Tower from here today, which is just a short hop away."
7,5.0,"When you are in Seoel, i advice a visit to the Olympic Parcours.When you close your eyes you feel the présence of the top-atletes. The several sports accommodations will give you A good idea.I don’t know if in 1988 all the works of arts and the status allready where.But it is worth to see.There are two musea to visitAnd there is A beatifull rosé-garden. Go thereSo take A half day and enjoy"
8,5.0,This is a very fun place to visit. We rented a bike while we were there and explored the whole park. This is a great place to come to escape the crowded streets of Seoul and to get a taste of nature in the city.
9,3.0,"A lovely park and worth a walk around, but if you only have a short time in the city, then just go to the plaza and see the flags and gate. It is close enough to walk to Lotte tower and mall where there are lots of places to eat, drink and shop, but there are also a couple of restaurants in the park itsself."
10,5.0,"This is a place where opening ceremonies were organized in 1988. Beautiful park with some cafes, ponds, walking routes, museums... If you want memories the games there is a wall which tells the Olympic game winners. Children can rent bicycle vehicles."
11,4.0,"Worth it just for the World Peace symbol which was the logo for the 88 Games. It is a huge structure dominating the plaza, the shape of which up close was different to what I had seen and remembered.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
12,5.0,"We walked through the park on our way to the Lotte Mall and observation tower.  It was fun to see but not a ton to see, an easy walk through on your way to other things."
13,5.0,"This place wasn't on our agenda to visit but since we had some extra free time we decided to do give it a look-see.  Absolutely no regrets.  The 1988 olympic site is now an excellent public space so we see a lot of Koreans come here to unwind or to take a lunch break.  We entered via the front going through the expansive Peace Square plaza and along the boulevards lined by pillar masks made by sculptor Seung-Taek Lee that leads to the World Peace Gate and the eternal flame.  We hired a tandem bike so we could quickly get an overview of the park and then decide which spots we would like to cover in greater depth.  The Flag plaza is still flying the flags of the participating countries.  Incorporated in the park are the ""themed parks"" - the cultural art park with more than 200 (many captivating) sculptures scattered throughout its sprawling lawns along with the Olympic Musem and the SOMA (Seoul Olympics Museum of Art), the leisure sports park - obviously, the environmental eco-park with flora and fauna that excites and lastly the history experience park featuring  the historical fortress and museum about the Baekju period.  Once can easily spend half a day or more here.  Definitely worth the visit."
14,5.0,"...obviously, given why it was created. Well laid out with plenty of artwork for photo opportunities. Stadiums (stadia) are quite impressive. Nice for a couple of hours walk - can hire a bike too."
15,5.0,It was great to see the location of the 1984 olympics. We walked through the entire park and is well worth a visit.
16,5.0,"Being Olympic fans, we loved this area.  We could picture people milling about heading to events.  The Olympic Museum has free admittance and is worth a visit! Information is about all athletes, not just the Korean athletes. The entrance gate to the area is spectacular!"
17,4.0,"Great park, with food, sports, and bicycle (2-seater, 4-seaters) riding opportunities.  Fun place to relax take pictures, play games, and have a picnic.  I suggest it as a must see."
18,5.0,"It so happened that a music festival was on-going when my husband and I visited. We did not get tickets because we werent sure who were playing and most of them were local / Korean bands. There were so many people around the area but we were not frustrated as the whole place was just lovely! We enjoyed sitting on the lake whilst listening to the sound of the bands playing. It was so memorable and we thought if we ever go back to Seoul, we would not miss the chance to visit Olympic Park again."
19,5.0,"Whenever you visit here, you can enjoy beautiful scenery. The park was arranged and built with ancient historical sites about 30 years ago. You can see the harmony of the old sites and the sculptures which human made. Also goof place for trail; walking and running."
20,5.0,"Parade of beautiful flowers await you at Olympic Park.  Easy reachable by subway and just a short walk from the subway station.  We visited late in the season, October, so the peak season was past, however the Roses and Cosmos’ were beautiful.  Also enjoyed visiting with school children on a school outing.  If you love flowers this is the place for a convenient visit.  As Korean aspiring athletes train here you may have an opportunity to view a practice.  We enjoyed watching tennis players sharping their skills.  A great afternoon."
21,5.0,"I remember the games in 1988 and how I was allowed to stay up late to watch the epic, but ultimately the complete let down of the 100 meter final. From that day on I wanted to visit Seoul and the Olympic park, this year I finally got to go. With my memories firmly embedded in my mind I set off walking around this magnificent park, viewing the sculptures that each visiting team had left and the still used facilities. We took a bike and rode around for an hour before coming to a stop at one of the many coffee shops available.the Olympic park is a stunning place that brought the world together for the first time in 12yrs, worth a visit and so easy to get to."
22,4.0,"Although the day was cloudy, we took the bike ride around the pathways and gardens while looking at the facilities from 1988 Olympics. Some buildings were very tired and locked to the public; others had been turned into day care centers however the gardens, statues and memories were terrific. The gardens were turning with the autumn colours and many flowers were still out. Pretty great all round - well worth the couple of hours."
23,5.0,"Oh this was one of our most favorite days in Seoul. The park was big, beautiful and so well maintained. We went through the main entrance first because the street beside it is famous for the beautiful rows of yellow leave trees (forgotten their names!) but the park itself is just as stunning! Very peaceful, great for a stroll and picnic. The small speakers around the park even had classical music playing out of it which was a cute touch. LOVED this place!"
24,5.0,"We took the metro here which was convenient and easy to locate.   On the day we came there was an exhibition or festival with activities going on as there were lots of tents with segways, tennis and bmx around.   We watched a motorbike show with a few bikes doing stunts. The park was quite busy with school aged children around cycling,  people having a walk and taking their children to the playground.   The Olympic flame is still going and there is a museum which is free which was worth a pop in although there was potential to be much better and informative. We hired a 4 wheel bike for 1,000 won for 60 mins which was fun to go around searching for the various stadiums to save on a lot of steps and time.   The park is a great place to get away from the hustle and bustle of it all and whiled away a couple of hours for us."
25,2.0,This park is nothing special. It may have been nice back in 1988 when the Olympics were in Korea. However there's not much to see here now. No tourists go there. Only locals walk around here.
26,4.0,"I think a bike would be best to explore this place. They are allowed everywhere, and you would save a lot of steps. We only spent about an hour, but could go inside many of the buildings, such as the gymnastics arena, the indoor pool, etc.  wish we could have found a gift shop.  Lots of great Statues here. The acupressure path lets you walk on a walkway made of many types of stones, wooden beams, etc. that excercise parts of your feet. Print a map before you go, you'll be glad you did, if speaking English. Lots of drink vending machines along paths, and public restrooms are clean, free."
27,4.0,Husband and I ventured 3 subway lines to Olympic park station. Take exit 3 and loose yourself in the grounds. Originally opened in 1986 for the Asia games and then the 88 Olympic Games it has held together better than some other countries. You can hire bicycles which we saw many do or else foot power like us is fine as well. Easy paths and clear directions.
28,5.0,"Plenty to see and do whilst unwinding from the bustle of the city.Hire bikes, stretch the legs, take in the views and get some fresh air away from the traffic fumes. Food and drink outlets are plentiful as are toilet facilities.The antidote to Myeongdong, Gangnam, Itaewon and all central districts."
29,3.0,We drove and walked all over...never did find the Olympic Rings. :( There isn't much to see other than the feeling of being in the former Olympic village. That was cool.
30,4.0,"There wasn’t much to do but then again it is still the Olympic Park of the 1988 games. The Olympic flame is still there and so are museums. If you don’t get a bike, be prepared to walk. It is a bit run down now but so are many of the 2008 Olympic sites in Beijing and that occurred 20 years later. What we liked the most, and I am a big guy and love food is at night, they have a gathering of vendors and they bring together food from around the world. It was an enjoyable evening and I was able to taste food from around the world."
31,5.0,"Great location for many activities. Soccer, baseball, gymnastics and road racing. Olympic fans is a must visit"
32,3.0,"definitely worth going to, but wait until the spring flowers are blooming or summertime.  we rented a double bike buggy and that was a fun way to see the park."
33,5.0,"While I was staying in Seoul I use to walk/job at Olympic Park. really nice. Lots of paths, ups and downs.It's overall a very nice place to visit and walk."
34,5.0,"This park has it all.  Small river,  restaurants near the road,  subway stations,  bus stops,  jamsil is pretty much next door,  huge rose garden... the outdoor scenery is beautiful and very clean! You could spend a whole day here!"
35,5.0,"First, if you don't like gardens do not visit this park you will most likely find it boring and a waste of time.  If on the other hand you are like us and enjoy gardening visiting this site gives you an appreciation of Korean gardening styles.  You will have to walk past the entrance area and head down to the lake and walk clockwise around the water and across the stone bridge.  From there follow the path till you come to a archaeological dig, where they are searching for the inhabitants from 2000 years ago and go up that path will take you up the hill, which were the original battlements of the town.  Along the way you will find arbors of gourds and fields of flowers (we visited in late summer), as well as the Korean style of forest garden, where the concept is to construct a garden to look like an untouched forest, with grasses trees and shrubs.  Sometimes the trees are pruned to make them appear much older so to create a the view of seeing a forest from a distance and so using less space.  You can visit the pit hut where excavations done twenty years ago show the remains of part of the old huts, there is a guide inside who is extremely helpful and knowledgeable, and has a passing understanding of english. We spent four hours here and would recommend it for anyone with an interest in gardening."
36,4.0,"It's a very large nice park great for picnics and such but nothing to write home about.I wouldn't consider it a ""must see"" place but it's worth a look if you're in the area. You could also check out the Olympic Museum while you're there (it's free).Side Note: This was a very pretty park in fall when the leaves changed color."
37,5.0,"lovely place to go, absoloutely this place good for kids too. the garden with playground. I could wish have much time to enjoy the garden, but 1-2 hour spend for whole garden is enough."
38,5.0,"We went here for a concert while staying in Seoul. The park is huge! We did not allow sufficient time to explore, will definitely arrive earlier next time as there are many activities around the park."
39,4.0,"This very large park contains a couple of museums an old fortress you can walk along the top of, ornamental ponds. many plants & flowers and lots and lots of sculptures to appreciate.  It makes a very pleasant stroll away from the busy city and it is also interesting to watch Koreans at leisure."
40,5.0,They have already started to built the park to accommodate this famous event. Location is excellent and beautiful.
41,5.0,Really nice place. Sculpture park is impressive. You can rent bikes and small carts to go around it. It is also venue for various festivals.
42,5.0,"It is a really cool complex, go and visit it if you get time. We went there at night for a concert but it would be great for all activities that are hosted there"
43,4.0,"We came here on a day there was a k-pop concert on, it was crazy!  The grounds are beautiful, and we decided to hire a tandem bike for two hours to go exploring."
44,5.0,"The Olympic Park is so huge that it make take you more than half a day to fully appreciate the beauty of this place.They have lots of benches in case you get tired, lots of walking paths for those who want a leisure stroll, and left and right, you could see interesting objects.I believe, this is a place not visited much by tourist but I strongly recommend that you place this in your itinerary, especially if you love a leisure and nature type of walk."
45,5.0,"A nice park, with bike rental and public open-air workout facilities. The Olympic park, where the Olympic Games of 1988 were held, might be a place to visit for those who are interested in sports and history; other than that, it's in the different city part from the main attractions. Possible to combine with a visit to Hard Rock Cafe, a bike ride along the river, or a trip to Gangnam, each a few stops away by public transport."
46,5.0,Just love the calm atmosphere and scenery in this park.. great spot for photo taking and not to miss the Alone Tree when visiting this park..
47,5.0,there are many park in korea. this park is a good to visit i visited the park during fall. so many people came here
48,5.0,"What a lovely park. Nice views from the top. Close to shopping malls, so an ideal place to have a break during a shopping spree. Definitely worth a visit if you like parks."
49,5.0,"We really enjoyed our trip to the Olympic park, we hired a tandem bike and rode around for a while and enjoyed all of the views of the differnt sporting venues that were included.We caught the train out to here which takes about 40 minutes and loved every minute of it.The bikes are about 25,000 won for an hour and it's well worth it to ride around and see more of the park."
50,4.0,Olympic park is huge and well kept. There is plenty of open space to walk around and see. You can spend plenty of time here; it's a great place to relax. Seoul is great.
51,5.0,"I really love this place! You can relax a whole day on the grass, visit the Olympic Memorial Walls or have something to eat or drink at some of the cafés or convenient stores. Because it is so huge it seems like there are not many people inside. A great place for families because there are also many playgrounds and other fun places to go with kids."
52,4.0,"An amazing green park with many sports facilities open to the public, as well as inviting picnic spots and rambles. I like to think this actually achieved what the IOC want a city to have: a stunning international facility that continues be part of the beat of a city well past the celebrated event. Just a great place to unwind from Seoul's urban pace, as you'll see from the occasional jogging clubs, aerobics nuts, walkers and photographers you may pass. If you're an olympic enthusiast or collector you will find many lovely items for sale at the Olympic Museum near the iconic gate."
53,5.0,"Seoul's Olympic Park is an underestimated place, in my opinion. It is a lovely place for a day or at least half a day out.The park has different parts. There is the 'real' Olympic part, with an Olympic Museum and outdoor sculptures and all. And there is an adjacent sculpture park with the SOMA and another museum. All in all there are 100-200 huge sculptures from all around the world in a pretty, forest park!! How cool is that?!There is a lake, you can have a bite and a coffee in Angelinus, you can rent a bike, walk, people-watch and just relax.If you like sculpture parks, then I highly recommend this place."
54,4.0,"I've never been to an Olympic related venue/area before, but this place did not disappoint. It was awesome, and easy to get too as it was located right off of the Mongchontoseong metro station. When you come up the stairs, you'll see the World Peace Gate (Wing like structure) which is kind of cool. It's lovely to take a look at an area where the world's best athletes competed. If memory serves me right, I believe Jackie Joyner-Kersee (American) set the heptathlon world record of 7,291 points. As a tourist, I appreciated the open space of the park, and the history of the 1988 summer games. I did not get to see the actual venues, but I heard they were in use and not turning into vacant eye sores. It's a very pleasant place to take pictures, walk, or simply chill out and reflect. I would recommend making it a point to visit this area, even if for a half hour. Cheers!"
