0,5.0,"Me and my girlfriend visited this temple and found it as a very good experience. I would recommend it to everyone, especially if you are near by COEX mall"
1,5.0,This is a temple complex in the middle of bustling Seoul. It is very beautiful and interesting to see and well worth a visit while near COEX.
2,5.0,"We were only able to see a small portion of the temple grounds as it was spread out over a good sized forested area.  This was an unusual location as modern civilization has grown up around it.  It was unfortunate that most of the original temple buildings were destroyed over the years and had to be rebuilt.There was lots of parking available here should you happen to drive.  However public transport was still the best way to visit for us as it was close to many major sites such as the COEX Mall.The pathway leading to the temple was covered with colorful paper lanterns which seemed to be quite common.  The same paper lantern ""roof"" continued through the first gate until we arrived at the main temple building.  The main temple was large and intricately painted especially inside with the artwork surrounding the seated golden buddha statue. A short walk away from the temple led us to the Maitreya statue, which was a very tall representation of the future Buddha.  I believe it was considered one of the tallest in Korea.  It was located at the end of a wide plaza framed by a wall containing many miniature statues.  It was beautiful setting.There were various pathways and stairs that led further into the temple compound but due to time constraints and aching feet we did not get the chance to explore them."
3,5.0,"The place was illuminated, not least by the profusion of artistically painted (probably) paper models. And then we saw the beautiful circular arena at the top with the very large statue of Buddha surrounded by numerous statues and a much larger number of statuettes - a wow moment"
4,4.0,"Very easy access to the temple! The biggest plus of places outside of the city is that there are not so many visitors that makes these places gain a lot on the climate! One of the many temples so popular in Korea, with the here that we have preserved the atmosphere of this place"
5,4.0,"Seoul is such a large city - you don't realise the scale of it until you get there and it is clear the maps don't really do it justice. We came here because we saw some awesome pictures online of the buddha with the backdrop of the skyscrapers of Gangnam. To get that shot there is a path up behind the Buddha - but you might have to rustle some bushes to get behind and take that shot. Apart from the Buddha, there isn't too much to see or read about. This is a real place of worship and is not really built to be a tourist destination!"
6,5.0,It is quite spacious with a lot of worshippers. It is easily accessible in from of the COEX center and transportations stations.
7,5.0,A bit of peace and calm in a bustling city. Good to have a stroll through the temple and have some time to reflect. Our favourite temple that we visited in Seoul.
8,5.0,Easily accessible with Seoul Subway Line 2 - Bongeuna Stationor Samseong Station (COEX mall)I spent like 30 mins touring the area and praying respect
9,3.0,"To be honest reading all reviews I can’t fully agree. It is a nice place, but nothing exceptional.Quite fast visit, when I was there there were 2 funerals and that gave another aspect of the traditions, nice to visit, but not a real must (for me)."
10,5.0,"There’s a nice teahouse on the grounds of the Temple.  You can sit at conventional tables or at more traditional tables.  The staff does not speak English, but were great with hand gestures, pointing and laughter.  Lots of fun."
11,4.0,"Visited the temple as we were meeting a friend nearby at the COEX. It's quite amazing that a temple like this exists in the middle of a busy area in Seoul full of tall, modern buildings. It feels so secluded and tranquil you can be mistaken for a while that you are in the mountains somewhere. We were lucky to see a couple of monks drumming. One of them came towards us and gave my husband a rice ball which was sweet. My friend recommended we return at night and it was even more enchanting and mesmerising with the various lanterns lit up. A recommended visit when in Seoul!"
12,5.0,The temple was opposite our hotel and we had driven past it a few times.  We decided to visit one evening just before sunset.  The crowds were gone and the place was blissfully empty and relatively cool too.  The displays of lanterns were delightful and the new building construction was interesting to see as well as some of the painting and decorations on the older structures.  The whole site is free to enter and wander around.  Being next to the Coex site there are plenty of bus and subway options to get here or car parking on site if required.  As the evening progressed some of the statues and lanterns were illuminated which just added to the serenity of the place amongst the bustle of the city.
13,4.0,"Having explored many temples in South Korea, Bongeunsa Temple has its own unique glamour. I took a walk through in the late afternoon (4pm) once the temperature dropped and it was quite crowded. There was an unexpected traditional Korean drumming performance at 5:30pm. It was very loud and could be heard throughout the temple. I would definitely recommend wearing comfortable shoes because this temple is currently under construction and there is a lot of rubble and rocks on the roads. I loved the beauty of the forest hidden behind the temples. The trees were vivid green and the air was so fresh and crisp. It was certainly an amazing break from the hectic pace of life in the city of Gangnam. Due to the reconstruction, I don't believe there is a charge for admission to get into the temple which was great. 1-2 hours was certainly more than enough time to visit the temple. I would recommend anyone visiting Gangnam to visit this beautiful Buddhist monument, if time allows."
14,4.0,"Bongeunsa is a lovely calming place to walk around, particularly if you go in May when it is decorated for Buddah's birthday. It is a working temple, so there are some areas you can only go if you are praying, and there is very little information about the buildings and statues. But still, well worth a little stop off to see the beautiful architecture."
15,5.0,"if you like relaxation, calmness and tranquility, sign up for their workshop (Thursday 2pm) it costs W20,000 per person, they explain you about the philosophy, you will observe a tea ceremony and you will practice patience when drawing some letters, good experience, really I recommend it"
16,4.0,We were staying across the street at the Coex so it was very convenient to visit multiple times. Beautiful grounds and well maintained temple buildings. Worth a visit!
17,4.0,"Very nice temple. We just took a taxi from the hotel and visited it during the evening. By the way, all temples are open 24 hrs."
18,4.0,Visited this place while they’ve praying session. Its a great experience for us to see and learn how the culture here. The temple also have a nice and calm garden theme compound. A lot of bonsai and pear trees around. How i wish i can pick a pear and eat it there. Haha
19,5.0,"Got off the hop on, hop off bus on a whim at this stop.  Great experience seeing monks in action.  Old architecture from 1800s. Very cool experience."
20,5.0,"This is the top thing to do in Seoul in my opinion. Visited many temples around the world and this by far the best.It appeals to the senses - there is quiet chanting in one of the halls, cool wind drifts down from the hill behind, air crispy with the scent of trees and incense, prayer halls interpersed among the hill instead of a single imposing one.Beyond the explanable senses, i actually feel the holiness here. I am not a buddhist, but i get this sense of rest and anticipation  sitting in the dark in front of the maitreya bodhisattva."
21,5.0,"An Buddhist temple near Coex - International Exposition Complex. It is a peaceful place, a must see in Seoul!"
22,5.0,"This Buddhist temple is over a thousand years of age and is quite well kept and maintained. While the temple is only a few blocks away from a shoping mall, it is rather peaceful and quiet inside the temple. There are about 13 buildings / structures in the temple and be prepared to allow 2 hours or more for this visit. Further, if you happen to go there after 5 pm, try to extend your stay until 8 pm because when the lanterns are on (there are hundreds of lanterns near the temple entrance and in the main compound of the temple), you would suddenly find yourself wandering in a ""temple of lanterns"". How to go there: it is about 500 m away from the Bongeunsa Station (Line 9)."
23,5.0,"We visited the temple in April after shopping for a bit in the Coex Mall. Luckily, when we went there weren't too many other tourists. The grounds are beautiful and really peaceful despite being in the middle of an urban area. The decorations are colorful and ornate. There are statues throughout the entrance area as well as a canopy made of colorful lanterns. There are also many beautiful buildings with alters that people go to to pray. We saw two cats that seem to call the temple home too. My favorite part was the giant buddha statue in the back."
24,5.0,Amidst the chaos of Gangnam is this beautiful temple.  There is a sense of serenity when you step inside its courtyard.  I heard the monks chant and saw people worship.  The colorful llaterns welcome you and then at the top of the steps are thousands of white laterns with the wishes and devotions of many Buddhists hang close to the heavens.  The temple was founded in 794 and was moved to it's current location during the Joseon Dynasty (1500's).  Lots of history here.  I love to meditate and practice yoga regularly so this place was really nice to visit for me.This is a must see if you are already touring Gangnam.  You are just minutes away from shopping at Hyundai Department store and other cool areas of areas of Gangnam.
25,5.0,"If you have very little time -- this is the temple to visit. Such an oasis and they even offer you accomodation if you enquire ahead. I stayed in Seoul so I organised a GangNam day in which we took a bus from Namdaemun direct to GangNam central (takes 20 mins) -- have lunch.You can walk 2 kms to the Sejong Tombs (which is on the way to Bonguensa) or you can take a subway ride. I was hot and lazy: i took the subway. After the tombs, we walked 700m to the subway and took another 5 mins subway ride to Bonguensa Temple.Tip #1: Download the Seoul Subway app which will tell you what buses and trains to take.Tip #2:Download Maps.me app offline version so you can walk around and find the pesky bus stationsTip #3: The train back from Bonguensa can take you directly to Seoul, MyeungDong or Namdaemun"
26,3.0,"The lanterns and large Buddha statue are interesting to see, however this is working temple so it did feel appropriate to look inside. The outside was very similar to the Joyse temple in Insadong. The lotus offerings at this time of year was a bonus.Can easily combine your visit with Olympic Park or Gangnam district, both of which are close by.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
27,5.0,"I was so happy to be able to return to Seoul after five years and experience Bongeunsa again. This is a wonderful welcoming Buddhist temple located right in the heart of Samseong Dong / Coex area that allows for a quick respite from the hustle and bustle. The people are welcoming even if you are not familiar with the rituals. The entire grounds are decorated with colorful ribbons and paper lanterns. It is a very calming contrast to the modern urban world beyond its gates. It was also nice to see some renovations and expansion in progress, we look forward to another visit in the future ."
28,5.0,"Its Temple is opposite the Coex, a convention hall. When enter to main gate, colorful lanterns are floatting in the air, So tidy and beautiful! Inside the temple, there is an information counter, main building for praying, small building beside for activity and the stair for go up is behind this small building!For the Big Bhuddha, just walk up. So nice place, take a deep breath for very nice weather there!!!PS for tourists should be polite and do respect to the sacred place or statues. I think they don't restrict to the very short clothing but we wore T-shirt and covered-knee pants with sport shoes(walking support, Fine)."
29,4.0,"Fortunate to see the temple area with snow and without. What a calmness in the heart of a bustling area of Seoul! The grounds are beautiful and you'll forget you are across the street from a convention center.We spent about 1 hour walking the grounds. It was fairly romantic with the snow covered trees actually. It was great to just walk across the street from meetings and a busy shopping area to relax in the temple. Recommend more as a respite from a hectic day rather than a must see spot. If you are at the convention center, take the time to go."
30,4.0,"This was included in a half day tour.  It's near the COEX center so easy to see it if you are headed to the aquarium.  If you only have time for one Temple though go see Jogyesa, the chief temple"
31,4.0,"Across the street from the western modern COEX Mall, this was a nice 180.  Dressed up for Buddha's Birthday in early May this is a nice colourful walk in the park.  A large Buddha statue has a prime location.  This is on the #9 subway line also so a short ride from many Gangnam locations."
32,5.0,"I was in Seoul for 2 weeks and this is one of my favorite stops! It was a lucky random find during our walk around Gangnam. Beautiful area any person, regardless of spiritual beliefs, can appreciate!"
33,4.0,This temple complex is opposite the COEX   shopping centre. There are a lot of buildings and explanations on leaflets. There are opportunities to light candles and present offerings. There is also the tallest stone statue in Korea.
34,3.0,"Was nice enough place to look around and see. A little village right in the middle of the metropolis. But we were there on a freezing cold windy day and didn't fully appreciate it. So if you're popping into COEX across the road, and it's a warm day, take a look. Free entry."
35,4.0,"One of the 2 attractions I enjoyed most on our visit to Gangnam. Went there at around 6pm and the gates are still open. Glad we visited the place at night as the huge standing Buddha looks stunning with the lights on and the mountains perfectly placed at the background.., so photogenic! Admission is free, printed English guides are provided, and you can enter the temples. Picture taking is allowed. Just observe silence since this is a place for worship. COEX is just across the street, so you can do shopping after."
36,5.0,Wonderful temple. Free admission. Very beautiful and scenic. People at the gate were very friendly and helpful.
37,4.0,"A quiet place to hide from dynamic Gangnam-go district, though it can be a little intimidating for those who are sightseeing. The lanterns are beautiful!"
38,4.0,"A must visit, its a temple that is still in use so its great to see the traditional Buddhists walking around. Also a good break from the hustle of the city."
39,5.0,"A giant old asian castle. Close to the train station and incorporates a museum in the middle, some of it is still under construction but the place is massive so plenty to see"
40,5.0,"This Buddhist temple, for me, was my biggest discovery in Seoul. with more than 1200 years of history, this place is clean, exquisitely beautiful and retains a surreal charm. One can attend the ceremonies and chants in the main hall, and I wish I had more time to spend here."
41,5.0,"Been here 3 times. This temple been around for >1000 years and there are plenty of precious relic including old paintings, buddhist sutras. Other than the main temple hall, there are quite a few small structures around the site. Dont be discourage when you see the hall is closed, not sure why it is always closed unlike temple in other countries, you can get in from the side door, but remember to remove your shoes. Once you are inside, you will see many people praying & meditating inside.On my first visit, an old man told me not to miss the lunch because it is only 1000 Won but I already had lunch.  My second trip, we just missed the lunch. We went there again the next day at 11.30am and there was a queue of hundreds of mostly old people.  We followed the queue, paid the money, picked up the utensils, and the volunteers will serve you rice, kimchi, dried vegetables & hot soup all in the same bowl. Simple food but heart warming food."
42,5.0,"A great place to visit , we felt peaceful and quietness , a very big Buddha in a huge space you and pray to if you like , and pic for your memory to bring back . An A , for us ."
43,4.0,"In the middle of bustling Gangnam, it is a peaceful place to wander and enjoy.  I am not buddhist but I enjoy seeing the different temples, their history and the rich tradition throughout.  It is currently under construction so not as peaceful as normal but still a sight to behold.  Wander the grounds to see the many small buildings for worship and the amazing, huge statue in the back.  It is free and easy to get to from the Coex shopping area."
44,4.0,Impressive statue which remains you the splendor of the old days. Some people can pray or just meditate.
45,4.0,"The real attraction of this temple is the 75-foot tall standing Buddha located on an elevated site in the very back of the temple complex.  Be prepared to climb some steep steps to get there, although I did see the locals walking on a dirt road on the left side which looked a lot less difficult.  The buildings composing the temple complex are actively used for worship and study.  Visiting Bongeunsa Temple felt like an authentic experience."
46,3.0,"This temple was close to our hotel so we checked it out after a day of sight-seeing. Not the most impressive find. Most of it was closed, with quite a lot of partitioning - perhaps they were renovating or there was a festival on? The enormous Buddha is stunning, but other than that I wouldn't recommend searching for it."
47,5.0,Came to to relax from the city as well as to see the interior of the temple.It is a huge complex but amazingly calm
48,5.0,I was surprised by the beauty and location of this ancient temple being so close to the hussle and bustle of Seoul and being so close to the COEX building. As soon as one enters the ambience and tranquillity is noticeable even though it was packed with tourists. Definitely worth a visit. Free of charge too.
49,5.0,"The temple is located opposite COEX. There is a big Buddha statue and a few spots to explore. You can also buy candle, rice or grain to offer to the Buddha at the front door. I went on the day that there were lot of local chanting. So I missed a chance to get into the main Buddha hall (Daewoongjeon) however, to see lot of local chanting is a nice experience. You can book for a temple tour or walk around by yourself. There is an English info available."
50,4.0,"Gangnam is busy and trendy and full of cool restaurants and hotels and shopping malls so it's great to have this temple complex so close. A short walk from Samseong subway station on Line 2 (exit 6), or Bongeunsa station on line 9 (exit 1). Even if you're not a Buddhist (I'm not) you won't fail to be struck by the peace of the place. The sounds of chanting from the various temple buildings. And a wooded hill behind it all just to sit and be. After all this is the main temple for Seon Buddhism - better known as Zen."
51,5.0,This is a beautiful temple that is USED!  It was so nice seeing people praying.  Such a peaceful place.  I guess you can actually stay there and participate in the practices.  We happen not to be buddhists.
52,5.0,We were shopping at local mall and this was across the street. It was great to be able to view the monks in the active temple
53,5.0,"This temple was so lovely, serene and peaceful. The architecture is exquisite. Walking through the grounds and listening to the chanting in background was so wonderful."
54,5.0,"Located across the street from Intercontinental hotel. This temple is relatively easy to find. Peaceful and quiet. Temple ground has a lot of greenery. At the time of visit, the monks were chanting Diamond Sutra in the prayer halls. It was ok to enter and watch as long as one remained quiet and respectful. Architecture was interesting. I visited during the Lotus Lantern Festival. There were displays of big and small lanterns around the temple ground. This temple also offers a temple stay program. An excellent way to get away from it all."
55,5.0,"This was probably the best attraction in all of Gangnam, considering that it was FREE.  The temple grounds are lovely, and the architecture is stunning.I'd love to see this place lit up at night, I bet its gorgeous."
56,4.0,"Lots of preparations being done for Thursday's service, so there were a few large trucks and workers present. They were a bit of a distraction for pictures in some areas."
57,5.0,"It was my favorite stop and a true sanctuary in Seoul.  I didn’t know what to expect when we walked up to Bongeunsa Temple but a calm came over me about thirty seconds in.  It was around 5:30pm and we were just in time for the evening prayer.Bongeunsa Temple is a beautiful 1200 year old buddhist temple nestled in the midst of a concrete jungle, located a bit far from the typical tourist sites, right in front of the Intercontinental Coex hotel."
58,5.0,"What a beautiful, peaceful place.  And a great chance to glimpse the real life of the holy people who call it home"
59,5.0,"One of the very few tourist site south of the Hangang river. A real jewel. Not only a temple but many temples, pagodas. Lovely walk through the park, very nice garden."
60,5.0,"My husband and I happened to be staying across the street from this temple, so it was at the top of our to do list for today. We are so glad this was our introduction to Seoul! Although it's in a busy part of the city, you'd never know it from the inside of the grounds. It's free, and it's an active Buddhist Temple, so you get to see and hear how they worship. We thought it was very interesting, and well worth the visit!"
61,5.0,Well worth a visit if in the area. It's a local visit for me and i love temples and  go regularly. Fantastic in summer. Go for it!!!
62,5.0,"All constructions are very nice and beautiful. It seems that the garden is also nice.  However, given that our visit was on 1st of January, we could not see the most of this garden. It is better to come here from mid spring till the mid autumn."
63,4.0,Great place to visit but please bear in mind that it is a place of prayers so please respect the place
64,5.0,"Free entry, so authentic. We were the only tourists there, everyone else seemed to be there to pray. We didn't get a chance to see a service as one of the people praying shooed us out of one of the temples when they saw that we were just tourists taking photos, but in a way I liked that. It showed how 'real' the temple was, not something special that has deteriorated into a predominantly a tourist attraction. Best temple in town. Right next door to Bongeusa subway on line 9. Be respectful and discreet with your cameras. Bear in mind that first and foremost you are in a place of worship"
65,4.0,"This Temple is quite well hidden from the surrounding hustle and bustle of Gangnam. You could blink and quite easily miss it. When you enter the temple grounds, it's quite surprising how large the temple actually is. The temple is beautifully preserved, it has a number of pagodas, and one of the largest statues of Buddha at the foot of the top hill. Looking down from the statue, you get to enjoy a difference perspective of Gangnam. The temple is also part of the Temple stay program that is popular with foreigners and highly recommended for those seeking something different and alternative to the buzz of Seoul."
66,5.0,Wow heaven you can stay at this temple if you want to do a retreat . The day we went it was full of people praying and they had a full on service with singing and it was wonderful to see so spiritual . the temple is huge and has quite a lot of different parts to it . There is a big white statue outside on the hill which is huge and it is so peaceful to walk around and there is a huge bell which is in a preserved casing you can look at . The white lantern on the roof make a big flash of colour as well as the red ones in the temple itself . We just walked in off the street no entrance fee like some charge
67,5.0,"The largest Buddhist Temple in Seoul. Calm, serene, Has a nice tea house serving green tea. Tried not to disturb people praying inside. Be sure to visit Jogyesa Temple which is located in the center of the city."
68,4.0,"In and among the skyscrapers is this temple of tranquility.  There are rooms where you can go and meditate or just sit peacefully.I saw many workers sitting in the gardens during their lunch time, which is what i would have done, if I lived and worked there.They offer an over night stay for a fee or an afternoon of meditation and lantern making (again, for a fee)."
69,5.0,"We stumbled upon this temple by accident but were so glad we did. We ended up getting there during prayer time and it was a moving experience. Beautiful grounds, interesting history and a great cultural experience. The temple is near other attractions (e.g. CoEx) and would make a great stop during exploration of Gangnam."
70,5.0,Loved the tea room. The tea ceremony was taught to us by a very gentle monk and payment is donaton only.  The contrast to the city is dramatic in mood and archetecture. It is a working temple.
71,5.0,This is a very serene and peaceful place just a short walk from the bustling city. Seeing the locals pay homage to the Buddhist shrines is inspiring. Well worth a visit.
72,4.0,"The temple itself is full of many places to see. The different halls, the Buddha statues and the colorful lanterns make this site a truly religious and sacred place. We happened to visit at prayer time and it was interesting to observe the rituals and prayers."
73,5.0,"Went for praying with my wife while on holiday. Very grand temple that is very well maintained and kept its architecture that spanned centuries ago. It is very clean, and there is a magnificient Buddha statue facing the modern, highly developed Seoul Metropolis. Buddhist books on sale but all in Korean though.Highly recommended for Buddhist tourists visiting Seoul."
74,5.0,"Right beside the temple to excess that is the Coex Mall, sits this haven of tranquility.  We loved the paper sculptures - really beautiful."
75,5.0,Delight to visit after sun set when all the displays are lighted and the lanterns glow... Its a fairly big temple so do set aside 30-45 minutes to get a complete view of the temple
76,4.0,Very nice Buddhist Temple in the COEX area in Seoul! A moment to medidate in a green authentic space situated between modern buildings and skyscrapers.
77,5.0,"We enjoyed this peaceful temple, If want the best experience try (temple life), It will take around 2 hrs and cost you 30 $. before you leave try lovely Green Tea in Korean Way for free but you have to donate and put the money you want in small box"
78,4.0,"Despite being a tourist place, it is very peaceful here. The scenery is moving and beautiful. The best time to come here is during autumn and spring. Very colorful nature art, amazing chery blossom. Simply love it."
79,4.0,"We had a guide with us so had the advantage of getting a description and a bit of history of what we were seeing.  The Temple grounds were larger than some of the other temples we had seen, and there were a number of interesting buildings.  It was worth inclusion in a tour."
80,5.0,"It is a 1200year old temple built in 794 C.E. during the reign of  King Wonseong. Today it is the center of Buddhist practice where monks apply themselves to chanting, monastic meals, communal work and Seon meditation. Explore the 12 views , starting with Jinyeo-mun, Gate of Suchness, things just as they are. From this gate, your trip to the ultimate truth begins. To the left and right  are the 4 celestial Kings., constructed from wood.  Up ahead is the Beopwang-ru, Dharma King Pavilion which  faces the Main Buddha Hall., Daewoong-jeon.. There are also other praying halls and at the time we visited chantings and prayings were being carried out at these halls. You could feel the qi.  There is a 23m high  Statue of Maitreya Buddha , the future Buddha who vows to save sentient beings in the era after the lifetime of Sakyamuni Buddha.. Up next is the statue of Haesu Gwaneum-sang, Bodhisattva of Compassion in the pond., behind the Bell Pavilion. Inside the pavilion are 4 instruments- a Dharma Bell, a Dharma drum, a gong and a wooden fish. These 4 instruments are struck just before services at dawn and in the evening, with the intention of saving all beings in the universe. To get here, we took Line 2 and alighted at Samseong station, exit 6 and walk straight ahead for 10 minutes."
81,5.0,A beautiful refuge from the bustle of the city. The big standing buddha and the surrounding buildings make a very picturesque visit. We were there in May and it is the month os Buddha's birthday. The lantern festival makes very good picture opportunities
82,5.0,"I never thought I could find such a quiet and serene atmosphere right in the middle of upscale Gangnam. The monastery is beautiful, well-kept, clean. Overall there is a very positive vibe, the nuns are very nice. We talked to one and she said they pray all day for re-unification of Korea. Better than expected experience."
83,5.0,My husband and I visited and we were amazed by the beauty and serenity of it all. beautiful detailed artwork.
84,5.0,"I love that there is this zen spot among all the tall buildings in the area. Very relaxing! I am glad that they opened the temple for temple stay, wish we had more time to stay. The people in the information counter are helpful and informative. There are candles, incense, and rice if you want to make an offering. There is a nice, huge drum with a dragon head in one of the structures. They have a stream going down towards the main gate, beautiful! Worth the trip!!!!!! Go and visit."
85,4.0,"Bongeunsa is a little out of the way if you are visiting central Seoul, but if you are in Gangnam, this is well worth the visit.  The temple has some relics, a manicured grounds, amazing structures and even a shamanistic shrine.  It stands out from the otherwise modern setting.  Worth a trip."
86,5.0,"Its a place were you can stay in peace and relaxing, in the middle of a big city like Seoul. Beautiful place, visitors can learn about meditation and buddhism."
87,3.0,"We found it in front of the North front of the Coex mall easily and took a stroll around. There weren't that many people and you could hear monks chiming around the place (followed by groups of tourists)The hall with the many red paper lanterns is quite beautiful, and so are the statues, but it isn't as inspiring as many were not built many years ago, but recentlyBe prepared for quite muddy ground and few English signs. TheOne that were translated were written in a confusing way, while referring to statues and decorations without stating properly where it can be found or being in proximity of them."
88,4.0,"Very surprised to find this temple sitted in the bustling city and streets. However, once you step in, you will find it very tranquil and serene. A huge compound for a temple, one of the biggest I've been so far!"
89,5.0,"go early in the morning. Less crowded.Still a very authentic temple , in the middle of the city. Just next to the Korea World Trade Centre. You can reach it using the Metro."
90,5.0,Go at night to experience the peaceful tranquility of the temple grounds while surrounded by the bright lights of Gangnam. The big Buddha statue is a must see!
91,4.0,"This is a lovely temple, located near the COEX mall in Gangnam.We visited the temple after dark, so we managed to enjoy its lovely lights, lit flowers and candles in all their glory.There was a quiet ceremony going on during our visit and it was very tranquil and peaceful to watch the worshipers during their prayers.While the temple itself is not too impressive per se, it's still worth a visit.Don't miss the lovely statue in the back side of the temple.There's no entry fee and you could easily spend 30 minutes to enjoy this place."
92,4.0,"This temple/shrine complex is a nice escape from the busy Gagman neighborhood. It has beautiful landscaping and buildings. The monk (?) who was singing was so on-pitch we though he was a recording, it was very interesting to see modern Buddhism in practice. We are staying at COEX and it's literally right across the street. Check it out!"
93,5.0,"In the heart of the bustling Gangnam district is where the Bongeunsa Temple is located - near the Coex Mall/hotel. The temple was very well maintained and had various ceremonies going on when we went to visit. There is no cost to enter and you can easily spend about two hours here walking the grounds. I wouldnt necessarily go out of my way to visit this place, but it was on our way to shopping at Gangnam so we stopped by - totally didnt regret it though!"
94,3.0,"There are a lot of people praying which may seem odd for a non-religious person. Ok place to visit, the Buddha statue is nice, but not much to see besides that."
95,5.0,"This temple was opposite our hotel so, we visited it rather a lot and each time we found something new and interesting. It is situated North of the COEX Mall. The oldest building is still standing and was constructed in 1856. The temple also runs activities and programmes from 4hrs to 2 days where you can learn about Buddhism, meditation etc. There is a shop selling Buddhist goods and souvenirs. My only criticism, which is unfair of me, is that the monks start ringing bells at 5am which woke me up each morning in my hotel room ! !"
96,5.0,"The temple is magnificient. Structures are beautiful, from the buildings to the huge Buddha statue. There is even a temple stay on its ground. It interposes well with the surrounding modern buildings. It is easily accessible via the subway. Just drop off at the Samseong subway station and it is not far from there. Admission is free."
97,5.0,"Went here after a walk from Gangnam. Have been to many Seoul and Korean temples, this was the best (and FREE) The mix of statues, temples, gardens trees and buddhist monks was a dream (as a photographer) I got 150+ quality photos and the green and natural backdrop is sweet. Areas here to sit, relax and contemplate too... Enjoy!!!"
98,4.0,"I took the walking tour, they have it once a day. Guides are volunteers, so they English is so-so, but I took part in tea ceremony, lotous crafting and ""meditation"". It was good experience:)"
99,5.0,"Located just directly opposite intercontinental hotel coax, samseong station line 3 (green line). In fact it's directly opposite our room. We could see full view of it! Feeling is amazing as Bongeunsa temple is like situated in a mountain but it's in the city! It's sun so there is service in the main hall. It's a pleasant walk around the temple to pray, very honored to see 佛经<般若波罗蜜多心经> displayed in 1 of the hall. We felt so touch. There are kids singing song towards end of service, buddha song I guess as its in Korean, rhythm was so peaceful, calm yr mind n soul....The temple is surrounded with yellow flowers almost everywhere really pretty. We are glad that we found this place after so many times to seoul! Well, It's never too late to pay respect to our Buddha in Seoul!"
100,5.0,"Very beautiful Temple, quiet and charming place, that is surrounded by skyscrapers and modern buildings."
101,4.0,"The temple is approximately 1200 years old. There are more larger and prominent temples & palaces around Seoul but this was one that impressed me the most.When you visit Seoul, take note it is divided between North and South of the Han river. Northern part of Seoul is approximately 600 years old and it's in this part of Seoul where most temples & palaces are located at. North is the city centre and here is where you can do most of your sight seeing and shopping. Everywhere, you will see the modern Seoul being intergrated with the old Seoul in harmony.Now back to Bongeunsa Temple. This located in south river in Gangnam district. Gangnam is approximately 70 years old, very sophisticated part of a Seoul. It's where the well to do stay in Seoul. What's impressive is how preserved this 1,200 year old temple is from the artifacts right up to the structures built in the the temple surrounding. I personally have never seen a place that old within the city which is so new. You would notice this immediately as you walk in to the temple.The artifacts are labelled with description and background in English for non Korean speakers. One will learn the importance of this temple in Korean history. This was the birth place of Korean Buddhism. The walk around the temple are between each temple is definitely an experience you will remember. Taking note that in Seoul, everything else is new, advanced and sophisticated. My respect for the Koreans for also being able to preserve their traditions, whether in art or religion was confirmed once I visited the temple."
102,5.0,"love it!! best part is it's right in the city, the views of old temple intertwine with new world in the background are breath taking!"
103,5.0,"This is by far my favourite temple I went to in Seoul. I visited the other palaces and temples first and left this until last. Its in a very inconspicuous place within lots of skyscrapers near the world trade center, and then suddenly you stumble upon this cultural oasis which is the Bongeunsa Temple. Its still very much used by the locals and its not as big as the others, but its extremely well looked after and comprises of a various selection of outbuildings surrounding 2 larger complexes. There is also not set way to walk around so you can really have an explore. At the back end of the temple there is a big Buddha statue in a stone courtyard. There are some truly wonderful photo opportunities here, dont miss it off your list. There is also a really nice shop at the entrance selling all manner of Buddhist jewellery, I got a really nice bracelet im still wearing today!  No fee to get in and easy to get to via metro."
104,5.0,This is a great place to visit. In the middle of a mass of high rise buildings sits this beautiful temple. Really quiet and peaceful. The weather wasn't great when we visited however if it was we would have sat here for a while to relax and take a load off our feet. The hustle and bustle of the busy city around you gets forgotten about. From the top you can see over the city and the high rises. It is a fair way out of the centre of Seoul but well worth a visit!
105,5.0,"The wife's Vietnamese, and Buddhist, so this one was looked forward to. Religious beliefs apart this place is a must see, The workmanship involved IS impressive. Quiet, peaceful, thoughtful place, skip the souvenirs shops, unless you fancy an ice cream, the rest is ""tat"", which should not detract from the temple and it's grounds. So, do GO !."
106,5.0,"We squeezed in a visit to Bongeunsa on our last night in Seoul. It was around 7.30pm when we got there and it was almost deserted except for a few worshipers and visitors. The lanterns above the worship area were lighted up and the whole place was quiet and peaceful. The only sound was from the wind chime hanging from the roof. The area where the giant Buddha stands was equally as quiet, with a couple of worshipers there. It was nice to just stand there and take in the serenity of the temple against the Gangnam evening skyline. The outside of the temple is not well lit at night. Therefore I don’t recommend going to Bongeunsa after sunset if your objective is to take pictures of the temple surroundings. However if you happen to be staying in the Gangnam area and would like to visit some place quiet at night, try going here."
107,5.0,The temple is in the middle of the sky high buildings. The scenery is breathtaking and the environment is peaceful. We prayed at the big Buddha statue too. Just go visit and feel the peace.
108,5.0,"Beautiful,quiet ,peaceful in the new part of Seoul ,stroll along and enjoy . Place of worship for Buddhist ,lovely monks chanting,soothing your soul !Near the new  COEX   Mall , a  10 minute walk  from Samseong Station Exit 6.  Worth your time and effort ,you will love every minutes there."
109,5.0,Visited on our first afternoon in Korea as staying nearby. It is a lovely peaceful place in pretty well maintained grounds. It is not a museum but a living place of worship with most building full of people with Buddhist monks chanting. I would think the tour would be very interesting.
110,5.0,"Beautiful temple with coloured lanterns covering ceiling,welcomed to walk around the grounds and right in the heart of Gangnam about a 10 min walk from station."
111,4.0,"Place is surrounded by high rise buildings, busy roads and bustling city but still you can feel the peaceful atmosphere of the Buddhist temple. Area consists of several buildings, few statues, ponds and beautiful park. Temple buildings are not allowed to be visited shoes on but there are shoe shelves just outside each door. Toilet is must see."
112,5.0,"Loved the tour of the grounds, landscaping and architecture of this beautiful temple. Definitely worth going to on your visit to Seoul.The tour guide spoke English so we were able to understand her."
113,4.0,"This old temple is the best part of Gangnam. Very beautiful and peaceful, and an interesting setting since it's juxtaposed with some of the fanciest modern architecture in the city. Worth an hour's tour, but be respectful of the people using the temple - I saw several tourists who either blatantly or obliviously ignored customs (didn't take shoes off, etc). However the temple users are very welcoming and seem eager to teach newcomers about their religion and way of life. I would like to go back and do a temple life program to learn more."
114,5.0,"Yes the buildings and site are very interesting, but this is a practicing Buddhist Temple.  Most of the buildings were holding 'services'.  I'm not sure there were any tourists, besides me at the site.  Virtually, everyone else was there for the services."
115,5.0,"Probably the most impressive temple in Seoul. Walk around to discover all the places, just a few minutes away from COEX. Take line 2 to the Samseong station exit 6 (then walk straight along COEX for a few minutes and turn left). That's why this temple is amazing, it's in the middle of the city, next to big hotels, and the biggest departement store. It's weird to see such a traditional temple there.Definitely a must see in Seoul."
116,5.0,"Arrived at prayer time on a Sunday and the chanting was very relaxing and melodic. Amidst the skyscrapers of Seoul and allits modernity, this temple complex has managed to survive and is great to walk around to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life."
117,5.0,"A beautiful temple right next to Coex Shopping Mall. I went last week and there were some upgrading construction works hence it was noisy. Otherwise, this will be a nice place to rest your tired feet while finding your inner peace. Would love to try out the temple stay or at least the half day temple programme if I visit Seoul in future."
118,5.0,This Buddhist temple surrounded by large buildings and malls (Coex) is a haven of peace where disconnect from the hustle and bustle of Seoul for a few hours. You can stroll and watch the faithful as they make their prayers and deliver offerings.
119,3.0,"A large and impressive temple in the Gangham area south of the river.  This is the more attractive of the two main Buddhist temples in the city although it is a long way from most of the main sights of interest.  It comprises a series of halls, pavillions and statues on a steepish hillside park."
120,5.0,"The temple ground is just too big to walk within a short time. With my limited spare time, I just had to cover as much as I can"
121,4.0,"The ancient architecture and art work is beautiful - An Asian version of the Sistine Chapel. Right across from the bustling COEX Center, this is a slice of history."
122,5.0,"Whether you are a buddhist or not, visiting this temple is really a good experience. Enter the main hall, sit down and you will feel your mind at ease looking at the peaceful buddha statue. If you have time, join the temple tour on Thursday from 2-4.30pm. I will hope to join the temple stay programme the next time I visit Seoul."
123,5.0,Bongeunsa is a 1200 year old temple located in Samseong-dong in Gangnam. There are over 12 different buildings located across the site and its an enjoyable walk around and get away from the busy city of Seoul.
124,3.0,"Located in or close to Gangnam, the temple is something of a haven from the high rises, but there is little other than antiquity to mark it out from other historic places of worship. It is set on quite a small site and is more tranquil than splendid; in other words, this is a modest but historic religious rather than tourist site."
