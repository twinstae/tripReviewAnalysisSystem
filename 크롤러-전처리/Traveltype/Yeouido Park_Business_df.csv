1,4.0,"Do pop by if you are nearby, otherwise I don't think it's worth it to come here. Went when cherry blossoms were in bloom, but there are many other places to view cherry blossoms as well. Overall a nice place for a stroll but only if you are nearby."
2,5.0,"This park and area are famous within the locals and tourist. Especially when I came here during cherry blossom season, better to come early to enjoy cherry blossom. This area is quite large. Can enjoy the city view, hangang river, nice weather, and picnics with your friends. I walk more further from Yeouido Hangang Park to see cherry blossom and i found the area that is really beautiful and enjoyable. Also there are some street food stall near the park. I love to spend some time here to relaxing my soul. And I think, during sunset time will be nice too even we can't see the sunset from this park."
3,5.0,"A night walk after dinner around Yeouido park ~Wonderful place with nice cherry blossom üå∏ view , cooling surrounding and nice scenery view!Lucky me ‚ò∫Ô∏è there are full of cherry  blossom and drama/movie taking just around it ~ Running man Jeon so-min just finish her part and leaving in front of me ~ so regret that I can‚Äôt had a chance to take photograph with her üò©"

5,5.0,"This is a huge park in Yeouido.One of the best parks to ride a bicycle in Seoul. And REALLY famous for cherry blossoms. So, if you don't want to mess with crowds, stay away on cherry blossom weekends."
6,5.0,"if you live nearby this park in cherry blossom season then do not skip this place.  it was really beautiful visit during March/April this year (2018).  enjoyed the beautiful trees. it looks more beautiful in nature than it look in pictures. no much things to do. just for walking and relaxing with family.  there is a small market for quick bite.  also, there is a huge open yard for playing around.  also, there is a street nearby full of cherry blossom trees.  i loved it during this season.  other seasons i am not sure how it looks."
7,4.0,"I swear by Yeouido Park because it has .. LAWNS!! These are very rare in central Seoul, but at Yeouido Park you can spread out a blanket and have a picnic in several spots. Even more, you can ride a bike along the shady perimeter circular route (or walk/jog if that's your thing). It's squeaky clean, has lots of big old trees for shade, and miraculously keeps out most of the car noise from the outside world. Once you get in to this rectangular little oasis, you really get refreshed."
8,5.0,"We visited Seoul in April this year to mainly watch cherry blossoms at this park. The park is beautiful and large. There are many things to see in this park, including hundreds of cherry trees in the park, as well as on the streets circling the park.Even if we missed the Spring Flower Festival (being deferred to later days) when we were there in the first week of April, we enjoyed our walk around the park. We also enjoyed the walk along the Han River next to the park. The walk is lined with many street vendors selling local foods."
9,4.0,We were there for the Spring Flower Festival.  It's quite crowded and there're performance on the street.Walking along the park with this beautiful scene is very relaxing. We aligned at National Assembly Station and took a short walk to the park.
10,5.0,Great place to view cherry blossoms as the road is lined with thousands of cherry trees on either side. We visited one day before the festival started and could drive through the entire stretch. Excellent place to enjoy cherry blossoms in Seoul.
11,5.0,"4 subway stations are around Yeouido-dong.  More restaurants, cafe can be found at the road side ""Gukhoe-daero 68/70-gil"" near the National Assembly station.  The atmosphere on weekdays and weekend are different.  But restaurants many closed on Sunday.Travel around early to mid-April is the best Cherry Blossom season at Seoul.  Yeouido Park is one of the most popular destinations for viewing cherry blossoms.  Recommended to travel during the cherry blossom festival at night time."
12,4.0,"Nice park, large playground at central Plaza then followed by a nice stroll along lush of greens and trees, also flowers. You don't feel your are in the city center."
13,5.0,"Many cherry blossom trees are planted on the bank surrounding Yeouido. Every spring cherry blossoms burst their flower bud. Yeouido Cherry Blossoms Festival is being held from April 7. to 12 this year. The Elementary Local Self-Government, Youngdeungpo-Gu is providing many programs. Although I know the bank surrounding Yeouido is called Yoon Joong-Ro, I write just a review about Yeouido Park because the bank surrounding Yeouido can't be searched exactly."
14,5.0,"Best time to go today or this week, sunny days. Nice weather. Lots of Cherry Blossom. Most are white colour, only few are pink"
15,4.0,Good place to relax and spent with kid. Bicycle rental is available and few stall of street food available.
16,4.0,"This park has a lot of facilities, not only for kids but also for adults and seniors. We visited this park on cold sunny day.This park was nice enough to walk around. The pond was frozen with leaves in it. In the middle of the park, there was King Sejong statue."
17,5.0,"Not just my favorite park in Seoul, but my all time favorite.  Better than Golden Gate Park in San Francisco (though it is much bigger).  And New York Central Park can't even compare.  I say this mainly because this park is keep very clean and in great condition.  Lots of beautiful views and connecting to Han Park as well.April is the best time because of the cheery blossom trees blooming.  The last time we were here, it was April, but really crowded because everyone else wants to come see the beautiful views.  It is also a time of year when it is not hot and humid.There are places along the way where you can buy some drinks and snacks, and you will see many people on rented bicycles.  Some locals bring their bikes.  We have never seemed to have trouble parking.  There is a fee in most areas at the park, but I consider it cheap.Just plain to spend a whole day there and have a picnic."
18,5.0,"My daughters and I rented bikes on a cool Autumn morning, just as the leaved started changing. 9000 won for 3 bikes for an hour (tandem bikes are also available). It was money well spent! It was so lovely to bike around the park! The bike track is flat and suitable for all levels. It was so peaceful and relaxing. You could stop along the way and take in some of the gorgeous scenery. There are also 2 little cafes in the park if you feel like a snack. Highly recommended!Just note that to rent bikes you will need to present one piece of ID (e.g. passport)."
19,5.0,it was so packed when i went here at Spring season.even though is not holiday but even the local people gather in here.Bloom everywhere!!! (human and flower)
20,5.0,"We specifically chose to visit Korea in the spring so we could catch the famous cherry blossoms in their full splendor, a decision that paid amazing dividends. With our son and daughter-in-law living in Korea, we were fortunate to have the best guides show us the best things Korea has to offer. We made it a whole day event, and luckily, we had the best weather for a long and pleasant walk through the park. The welcoming scenery was incredible! We've seen Washington DC during the cherry blossom season, and although it is a experience to cherish, Yeouido Park will by far always be second to none. What a magnificent site! We got there during the peak time and every tree and every bush was covered in blossoms. Pinks galore, whites and other colors were a true feast for our eyes. We chose to get a map, which you can pick up at the entrance, so we could find our way around. It was so wonderful to see how Koreans truly make use of such a stunning facility, we saw hundreds of local residents in sports attire taking to the numerous trails around the park. They obviously love to hike and enjoy the outdoor, and th. Are with which park official manage the park ought to be applauded. The park is very clean, it's kept in the most amazing condition, there are all kind of facilities throughout, clean restrooms in multiple spots, and even food stands to pick up light snacks. This was truly a wonderful day and the experience will last a life time. Beautiful park! We went in April, so be sure to take a light jacket or sweater, temperature can change rather quickly, so be pr pared. There are excellent sidewalks and flat parkways for parents pushing strollers, this is a great choice for families to visit. The park is huge!"
21,4.0,"This is a big park with many options within and around. You can rent a bike or inline skates to ride around, or just stroll around. There are nice restaurants next to the KBS building, or across the big road in IFC and around. You can buy snacks and beverages inside the park too.The park is linked to Han River park, and it is also a great park with even wider options. You can do water sports, ride a sightseeing ship, play at a shallow water fountain. Great for young kids."
22,3.0,"we had gone to Yeouido park to see the Cherry blossoms.  we were slightly disappointed , there were far too many people on the street where the cherry blossoms were. The street was also a main road. Every picture i took of the cherry blossoms  had  50 other people in it.     there was unfortunately also too  many street stalls on the road side which detracted from any beautiful shot of the cherry blossoms. . if you want cherry blossoms, then do the homework again or go to the Busan Jinhae cherry blossoms festival. its better there. one location has a small stream surrounded by cherry blossoms on both banks.  or go to the unused railway station to see cherry blossom trees on both sides .  by the way cherry blossoms only flower for a week. come too early and you see a few, come too late and you see no cherry blossoms. here is a tip , look up the ' korea cherry blossom forecast ' published from February to early march. Yeouido park though is a lovely open space to have a picnic and see the river. or to catch a river cruise up the Han river."
23,5.0,this place is mostly famous for its cherry blossoms. if you visit this place in the beginning to spring you will be able to see the beautiful cherry blossoms tree and it is just amazing.
24,5.0,"We went here as a family during the cherry blossom season and the views/photos were spectacular.  This is reasonably close to the Han River and the ""I Seoul You"" sign.  Enjoy!"
25,4.0,We were lucky to go here and witness the full bloom of Cherry Blossom Trees.  There are rows and rows of cherry trees in this area but a bit tricky if you will go there for a cherry blossom viewing as the blooming of the trees last only 10 days a year.  Go here in the morning as beginning lunchtime - lots of people are in the street / park.
26,4.0,"Went here after being so excited about cherry blossoms.  As many people know these flowers only bloom 2 weeks within a year and many celebrate as they are gorgeous. Korean loves their cherry blossom, not as much as Japanese do, but the trend is increasing.  In this park, do find the atrium and there will be many families, couples, friends playing here. From bicycle, rollers to scooters. You can rent easily but not for very small children. During the festival there are many food stalls and activities, so within these 2 weeks you'll get culture, happenings trends and current local favorites.  Since the event is outdoor do prepare umbrella as early April (when the flowers bloom) means there's rain every now and then and the temperature is still chilly. Best to visit anytime of the day but we do love afternoon as somehow it was more romantic."
27,5.0,yes we love the night lights of the trees with the cool weather and safe to walk by ourselves or by group
28,3.0,"when i gone here it was sunday and the spring festival was going on that day, that might be the reason why there is people packed around the park and beside the river. i get there by subway and it seem like all off the passengers was going to the this place...really2 crowded with people cycling, families were picnic in the park, children playing kites, couples walking around or just enjoying the breeze (its still windy and pretty cold), group of teens taking selca, ahjumma selling things.if you prefer place that not too crowded, i recommend you to go there at weekdays. the cherry blossom was not as many as at jinhae / yonggungsa too..."
29,5.0,"A beautiful park in the middle of the city. I visited Yeouido Park in spring 2017. There were beautiful cherry blossoms everywhere. You can go for walks, rent a bike or skate through the park. My husband and I rented a tandem bike and we found that it's the best way to get around the park. We managed to cover the entire park in a short time and it was not tiring either. The park facilities were also very good - there were a lot of public toilets around the area. You may also find the King Sejong statue at this park."
30,5.0,This is best to go to during Sakura/Cherry Blossom season because there was nothing much to see after that.
31,5.0,I came here when the cherry blossoms are blooming. Awesome. Very beautiful. So many young and old people walked around here. The park is the best place to refresh your mind after you got a long hard working time.
32,5.0,"We happened to be in town during Cherry Blossom festival which no doubt added to the crowds (which were not bothersome at all) but I enjoyed a long walk in the park.  Lots of beautiful flowers and lots of local folks taking in the sites, especially families.  Its a great way to unwind and get some exercise.  Urban building backdrop with nice natural scenery, local flavor you can bike and skate too"
33,4.0,"We walked the area to view blossoming trees but the week we were there only a few trees were in bloom.  The blossoms came out the week after we were there.  The trees in bloom were beautiful, as well as many other flowering bushes."
34,5.0,"i love this place too.Very nice organised park.We rented a bicycle and cycle around the park.But on my visiting day, the flower has not fully bloom.......:("
35,4.0,Went to this park on 3rd April with hopes to see cherry blossoms however only a handful of trees have bloomed. There were pretty flowers around and a nice small playground. A nice park for a stroll.
36,4.0,"On its own island on the Han River, the train ride from Seoul Central was less than 20 minutes for you to enjoy outdoor skating and sled. Great for kids to let go steam in the middle of winter"
37,5.0,We were lucky to have visited the park when the cherry blossoms are still in bloom. It was not as crowded as I have expected because it was early and a weekday probably. It's a nice place to walk around or stay for an afternoon picnic with your friends/family.
38,4.0,"It is where you can the lots cherry blossoms in Seoul. I came here in the second week of the April, so lucky that still have cherry blossom for me. It's the first time to see it. It's so amazing. But I didn't stay long cuz it was so crowded :("
39,5.0,"Although not too much areas where you can find some shade, the park along Han river is an excellent place to cool off. We liked the swimming areas a lot. Not deep, so safe for the children, but still fun walking   down the stream and wading in the pool was fun. The park is big. Bike rental is a good option to explore the entire area."
40,5.0,This is a very nice park with great views! Great nature feel in the city. The Cherry Blossoms are very pretty.
41,5.0,"It's the closest park to my hotel so it becomes my regular morning stroll place. Surprisingly it's quite nice with good trail, views, pond, a Korean garden, food massage stone trail, etc. All of us enjoy so much here."
42,5.0,"I was surprised to find a beautiful park in the middle of a busy commercial area. Lots of greenery, fish pond, flower, walking & cycling path, exercise equipments and plenty of seats. The park is open at night and had sufficient lighting. My favourite place to unwind after a long day."
43,5.0,"In the heart of Yeouido, you can find this small park that offers a tranquility and korean traditional beauties. Great place for a walk."
44,5.0,"Nice park for a walk, biking or playing in the grass. Across the street is the water area which is an awsome setup but not much shade. Bring an umbrella. Food trucks are where open at 6 along the river."
45,5.0,"I came here in autumn 2015 for international organ donation awareness program which was held here. I was immediately fascinated by the beauty of this park. The tree were so colorful, the breeze so soft, the air so refreshing. There was so much of different theme area designed or created at the park for everyone of different needs. There was a path for people walking, another path for bicycle. I had a 4 days meeting in Conrad Hotel in front of this park, and everyday I will come here after lunch for a walk. I hope I can come here again in future for cherry blossom."
46,5.0,"We went there in the early morning that cherry blossom was all over everywhere. Not much people in the park! we walked along and enjoy the sunshine with those pretty flowers. If you plan to visit Korea in April, Yeouido definitely is one place must go!"
47,5.0,The whole park was filled with gorgeous cherry blossoms! So glad we managed to see them in Seoul without having to travel outskirts.The park gets pretty crowded though.
48,5.0,I think this park is one of the best thing I've seen during my days in Korea. It was very good to see children and families playing in a very tidy space surrounded by the skyscrapers of the business district! I suggest you to spent here one or two hours during your visit in Seoul to take a break from the rest of the city!
49,4.0,Korea is famous for the cherry blossoms between late April and May if you want to see the cherry blossoms this park is the best place to view them. The park is also very large and very accessible by the subway it's close to the Han River and there are restaurants nearby it's a great place to stroll on an afternoon either with family or by yourself. You can also rollerblade skateboard and you can rent bicycles.
50,4.0,"Our family walked the promenade along the Han River during the April cherry blossom festival.  IT was something to see with the canopy of cherry blossoms that are beautiful as anywhere in the world.  But beware, it is extremely crowded since everyone else in Seoul seems to decide to walk under the cherry blossoms on the same weekend."
51,4.0,"Circular track through beautiful gardens, especially so in autumn. Track is some sort of artificial material,"
52,3.0,"During our visit, the cherry blossom trees were only starting to bloom. It made for a good walk though."
53,5.0,"Best Cherry blossom. Best fireworks. But check the schedule beforehand. It's got a little pond, plaza, statues and pretty gardens. They rent bicycles at reasonable rate. Continue to the public river park east of the Yeouido Park."
54,4.0,I had been in this park 4 times during my stay to Seoul. Park is good and equipped with required facilities.
55,4.0,"It's been a long time since I was in Korea for the first time! I was there with my family and it's our first family trip abroad. We went there in winter and the weather was extremely cold!! However, this place was just lovely and cozy to talk a walk. The scenery was beautiful!! It's definitely a perfect spot to go with your boyfriend or girlfriend !! Haha"
56,3.0,"Our first stop for Cherry Blossom in Seoul, but, we found the road behind the National Assembly to be better. It was a long walk from Yeouido Park to National Assembly but well worth it."
57,5.0,"The  trees  are blossoming  and the chance  for great  photos  are abundant. The  trees  surrounded  the buildings and officials  provided  lots of portable  rest rooms. Parking  can be found  but it is tight. Get there  early, beat the  crowds. If possible  bring  your  own  drinks  and  snacks. All in all  if you like flowering  trees  and other  floral  displays  you   will  not  be  disappointed."
58,4.0,We went to Yeouido Park during the cherry blossoms season and park was beautiful with trees lined on either side.Locals and tourists delighted in the festivities and there were street performers who mad the entire experience an enjoyable one...
59,4.0,"Went there this morning on a Sunday. Today April 5, the full bloom of the cherry blossoms has been delayed by mother nature probably due to climate change. Still, those along the road surrounding the National Assembly had a few hundred already in semi-bloom so still was worth the trip. I could just imagine when it is in full bloom a few weeks from now. Wish I was still here in Korea to see it. I don't get to see these where i come from. The park itself is a very relaxing place and the best part for me is i got to smell the scent of pine trees again! Last time i got to breath in these scent was literally decades ago! What a beautiful smell it was this morning! Totally refreshing! If you have the time to spare after you get tired of shopping and going to various tourist sites in Korea, i would suggest a visit here. Very easy to get to. Just as it is described by my fellow trip advisors. It is definitely an oasis in a city!"
60,4.0,"I stayed in hotel near buy. I walked in the park twice a day in the morning and in the evening. You can have great walk there. Do not use just peripheral ring... get inside,  it is nice there. Park is well designed. The main walkway surface is from hard foam material. It is great for run. There are several restroom and small convenient shops. Avoid lunch hours as Park becomes totally packed by employees from nearby offices."
61,5.0,"Yeouido city is in the middle of the business district with a huge mall nearby and many restaurants and shops surrounding it. If you are staying in the area, it is great to walk through, look at the beautiful spring flowers or take a run (the track is foam so much better on your knees than the road). It is such a well done park and it is nice to have such peace and beauty right next to one of the busiest and widest roads I have ever seen."
62,5.0,"If you love peace, go to this park. And if you love Cherry Blossoms or want to see one. You SHOULD go to this park. The park is extremely beautiful along with the blossoming cherry blossoms. :)))"
63,5.0,"I just visited Yeouido Park (behind National Assembly Building) on 19 April (Friday) & all the trees were in full bloom! I read that last year the cherry blossoms also peaked on 19 April. My family & I were so ecstatic as the view is magnificent! Very romantic, but it is very nice for family outing too. I know that cherry blossoms don't last long so I think we were really lucky. Not only in this park, but the cherry trees in other part of Seoul were in full bloom too! This was my first time seeing so many cherry trees in full bloom, so yes this is such a precious & sweet experience. There were some stalls selling all kind of snacks on the street too. Come on weekdays, as weekends will be too crowded.But we missed the Cherry Blossom Festival by 1 day, which lasted from 12-18 April 2013. During this festival, you can expect to see many street or cultural performances, and flower exhibitions."
64,4.0,"Visiting Yeouido Park was the highlight of our holiday in Seoul. The cherry blossoms were the reason why we came in April during spring time. We have heard that it‚Äôs not easy to predict when the cherries will bloom. But on this day, the 19th of April 2013, we came, and saw with our own eyes what we had only previously seen in pictures. We were told that the cherries started blooming 5 days before we came. To see the cherries still blooming when we were there, was a lucky day for us. Indeed, we actually saw the black and white magpies a few times at Yeouido, which are known in Korea as the bird that brings good luck. We started our tour of Yeouido Park from Yeouinaru Station at 9 am. It was cool and sunny, and a great day for a stroll. We admired the pink canopy of sakuras all the way to the National Assembly. There are many sakura trees in Seoul, but here in Yeouido Park, there must have been a thousand. We felt like we could walk forever, strolling tirelessly with the Han River flanking on one side and the commercial Seoul skyline on the other. Words just cannot describe how wonderful and serene we felt. We love the weather, the trees, the crowd, the couples, the school children, the performers and the stall vendors. It was marvelous when an unknown group of locals wanted to immersed themselves with us in a group photo. If there is paradise on earth, we may have got a glimpse of it right here in Yeouido Park."
