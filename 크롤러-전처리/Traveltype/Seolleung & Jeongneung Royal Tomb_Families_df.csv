One station away from Gangnam station, get off at Seollong station. A few minutes walk is a massive park with lots of walking trails.  The main attractions were the 3 burial sites for 2 kings and a queen but inside, you can catch beautiful foliage, some traditional structures and get some excercise.The park also wasn't at all touristy.  Apart from a few Europeans, we were the only foreigners there.  Most people visiting were olides going for some walking and talking with friends.If you want to learn some history and enjoy some less touristy spots in Seoul while still sight seeing, definitely give this place a visit."

This is a refreshing stop between COEX and Seollung area. The park itself displays tombs and relics of Joseon dynasty, with a few traditional Korean buildings. If limited in time, I would not go there on purpose, but if around, I would definitively stop again as a break. Small entrance fee."
