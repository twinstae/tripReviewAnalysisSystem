0,5.0,Nice place to walk and shop around.  Reasonable price.  Mostly cater to female accessories.  Probably one of the largest underground shopping area.
1,4.0,"The place is long 2 lane of almost 500 meters long selling mostly ladies wear, some phone accessories and electronics very few male clothings available but price is just right and not on the expensive side.."
2,5.0,"Large number of little shops selling pretty much women's clothes and accessories. All around krw10-15000. All individual local fashion. Cosmetics socks bags and all. Some noodle and coffee shops. It seems most of the locals shop here.Some rest areas for the men with seats while the partners shop. Free WiFi somehow. Actually can't read what it says for sign in to free WiFi but after some blind clicks, I'm in. Catch train to Express bus terminal on line 9. go to exit 8 and follow signs to gotomall. Couple of shopping centres around but that's another story..."
3,3.0,"Completed indoors and price point is low. You can do all your shopping here when if the weather is bad. The stretch is endless and conveniently located to public transport. But if you are looking for quality, go elsewhere."
4,5.0,Lots of things to buy at this mall for reasonable prices. Always packed! Great location by the bus terminal
