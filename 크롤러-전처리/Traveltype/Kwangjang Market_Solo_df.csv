1,5.0,Whole long stretch of street food where u find live squid as well. Egg pan cake is a little bit oily but is very delicious. This place is very special where u can order food and sit in front of the small stall to eat. Price is reasonable. Next to the main food street there are some stalls selling cloths and sports stuff.
2,5.0,"The Kwangjang (sometimes spelled Gwangjang) market is a real foodie heaven. Many resources on the internet say it closes at 6PM and this may be true for many of the shops, however the food scene seems to be going strong at least until 10:00 PM. Here you will find many street food classics such as mung bean pancakes, Korean blood sausage, dumplings, steak tartare, fresh octopus and many others. All menus are in English, I don‚Äôt see why you would book a tour to come here to eat - read up on the Korean street food dishes and venture out on your own - I met several nice Koreans as I was hoping from stall to stall who was very friendly and wanted to share their food culture and their Soju with a total stranger. Geonbae!"
3,4.0,"This one of Korea‚Äôs largest traditional markets, with one section selling authentic Korean street food. It is crowded with tourists as well as locals along the narrow alleys. For some stalls, there are some seats for customers who ordered pancakes, Korean dumplings, braised pig's trotters, gimbap, seafood, etc. If you are adventurous, you can try the raw octopus tentacles.There are also stalls selling fruit, vegetables, meat and fresh seafood. I purchased some apples and peaches, which were rather expensive. Suggest you buy fruits from other places."
4,4.0,Mung bean pancakes for lunch - yum. Shame you have to find a corner to eat them. This market is a food heaven as long as you can stand the crowds. There are some alleyways around - go for a wander and you will find some hidden treasures.
5,4.0,You can find lot of street foods here. These are the korean traditional food. Recommended to visit to have a good experience on the street food.
6,5.0,Lot‚Äôs of good food and too crowded also its one of korea‚Äôs old market thats why its a landmark tourist must visit when they go to seoul south korea.
7,2.0,Good for street food but way too crowded. The markets in Japan are so much better and well organized.Worth the visit tho for the food. Try blood sausages and pig foot.
8,5.0,You will find ecerything from this market. It is all cheap and you can find also the traditional things like hanbuk their traditional clothes
9,4.0,Come early to soak in the busy market sounds & smells. Great range of merchandise from socks to hanboks. Interesting restaurants selling live  octopus & raw beef. Supposed to be a local delicacy.  Good range of banchan  to buy home as edible souvenirs. I love my pickled sesame leaves.
10,5.0,"I love markets, and have been to many all over the world. This one might be my favorite. Spend an hour browsing, then pick the spot to eat that you think looks best. Order some food and Soju. You will be happy."
11,5.0,"Abundance of food, price very reasonable.  this market also sells clothing and household stuff.  Must go!"
12,4.0,I went to Gwanjang Market for the local food and I was overwhelmed by the choices and the crowd (both locals and tourists). Better decide what you wanted to eat before going there for dinner since this seems to be peak time. Take outs are possible though so you can just buy to go.
13,5.0,"I love this market. It's with full of nice yummy food. You just can't decide which stall that you should sit and eat. But, it's all the same on every stalls that offers. The food is super yummy and fresh."
14,5.0,"Gwangjang market is one of the oldest traditional markets and is is fun to visit. It is packed with many food stalls selling street food, fruit,vegetable meat and fish shops and also shops selling kitchenware, textiles, clothing and more. One of the popular items sold in the food stalls is the mung bean pancakes. These are deep fried and cut in pieces - making it easy to eat with chopsticks and you can dip it in soy sauce. I thought it looked greasy but it was delicious!"
15,5.0,"If you are looking for local food, this is a must visit place. There are plenty of food stalls in the market and you will be spoilt for choices here. The Korean pancake is one of the more popular choices of food here. The other point for this market is definitely its fabric shops. This is literally the place to shops Fabric especially the famous Korean Silk. You have to walk through the market to find the best bargain and I can tell you its gonna be a long walk coz the market is so huge. Its open in the morning and to go here, you can take subway Line 1 and alight at Jongno 5-ga Station and use exit 7 or 8."
16,5.0,"This enormous market is an absolute must visit when you‚Äôre in Seoul.  The market sells goods and foods and this review will focus on the foods.  First, it would be impossible to do this market justice by any single review.  One could spend a month here and still not discover all that it offers.  I was interested in trying Korean beef tatare.  I found my way to ‚Äúraw beef alley‚Äù and picked a place.  The beef here is delivered each morning and is of the highest quality and freshness.  I tried my dish with a chopped live baby octopus on top.  Most westerners may balk at the dish when they see the chopped tentacles moving about on top of a mound of bright red raw beef.  Break the egg yolk on top and dig in!  I guarantee it will be one of the most delicious dishes you have ever tasted.  If you eat sushi and like your steak rare, then it‚Äôs not much of a step to eat Korean beef tartare and live baby octopus."
17,3.0,"Nice atmosphere and lots of things to see and eat, but sadly smells like üêüwhich can be offputing overall it was good"
18,1.0,"This market has become a trap for both locals and tourists.It used to be a place to get some mouthwatering street food, but after it got popular, they no longer accept credit card and became super expensive. Not to mention unhygienic and rude atmosphere. You might want to try out just a little food there, but do not plan to have a whole meal because that will cost more than fine restaurants in the city. The quality has been falling for the past few years. Even for Koreans, this place is tough not to get ripped-off. (Oh, and the government actually protects shop owners from doing those kind of things because they consider them as being ""vulnerable"" compared to corporate-owned restaurants. Accordingly, there will never be an improvement)"
19,4.0,"Went alone one afternoon, had Kimchi Dumplings and a sweet Cold Noodle dish with ice cubes. I‚Äôve travelled across different parts of the world and found Korean food to be quite sweet, as well as pungent. It was cool to sit in the market and l got talking to a girl from Taiwan. Only downside is that a lot of the stalls are very similar, but still a cool place."
20,4.0,Gwangjang Market is a great way to experience an abundance of Korean dishes from sweet to savoury. There are so many stalls set up in the middle with some normal and weird food on display. Walk around the different areas to see the clothing and textiles too!
21,5.0,"You got to visit this market if you are in Seoul. It shows you what things Koreans buy for their kitchens. From various type of chilis, veggies to ginseng and silk cocoon. But the best part is the food vendors. Huge huge huge numbers of them. Good food but inexpensive price: best."
22,5.0,"One of the Korean traditional market where you can see and taste the local foods, experience the local shopping, to see the local foods, vegetable, fruits, Korean traditional side dishes, seafood, Korean Hanbok, etc. You may go to the Majeongyo underground shopping centre, they sold handmade traditional souvenirs and it is a little bit cheaper from the one in the market."
23,4.0,"I went there only for the the street food and haven‚Äôt been disappointed. I had chicken feet, tteokbokki, maiak kimbab and kimchi pancakes. I loved every single bit of everything I ate. Attention though because they have 2 separate menus for locals and foreigners and if you don‚Äôt speak or read korean at all you might pay 2000 or 3000 won more than locals for the same food."
24,4.0,"Big food market, crowded with a confusion of sights, sounds and smells. I was wandering from my hotel looking for somewhere to eat on a sunday evening when many surrounding restaurants were closed and suddenly came across this market with an over-abundance of choice of street food.Common format was to have a cooking stall at the front onto the street with some tables in a room behind. Sitting at the tables was a bit less frenetic. Not much english spoken, but got by fine with 'point and smile' as menus have pictures and an english title for each dish. A meal (a sort of half pancake, half omelette with green beans and seafood) and a beer was 16,000 Won.On a sunday evening I seemed to be the only tourist among thousands of people, many buying a take-away in metal foil containers. Going to the market for a desert of deep fried sweet pastry with a dipping cup of sugar also seemed very popular."
25,2.0,"This is probably the biggest and best food market according to the media, went there 1st thing in the morning, very disappointed. Lots of stalls but majority are the same food. Tried to cover each stall, unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt eat that much. Went there in winter, and the best thing was the seats were heated! Yes they were heated, how good was that for winter and an open space! But the food ... pretty average, nothing special. I was actually quite disappointed after my trip to Korea overall. I tried all the famous food I saw on the Korean drama, none of them were good. I was very keen on Korean food before, loved everything from the Korean restaurants here in Australia, but since I been there and tried it? I would say the Korean food which‚Äôs not from actual Korea is lot better. Korea is quite expensive compare to other Asian countries. Was there for half month and traveled from Seoul all the way down south to Jeju island, the only thing I felt good was the green tea waffle from Jeju island . So if u ever go on food trip, go to China, best food ever on the planet"
26,3.0,"It's a big market (or really collection of markets as there are other markets in the area) and there are some really great bargains to be found.There are tons of food stalls, but sadly they seem to all have mostly the same items and the ones I tried were ok, nothing more."
27,5.0,"Gwangjang Market is the place where you can find any Korean traditional food with reasonable price. Open till late around 9pm. Have visited it twice during winter, the hot topokki and japchae, plus soup for the drink, just warmed my body as I needed. One of a popular places to visit in Seoul, no wonder the market was quite dense by tourists during lunch."
28,5.0,"Lots of great street food and friendly vendors. It's a great market also for hanboks, Korean bedding, and housewares. And there are some souvenir shops at the ends as well. Definitely itinerary-worthy."
29,4.0,"Tourists would be able to find some local, delicious and cheap Korean style food here. However, the stands in the market basically all sell the same thing and it's lack of variation."
30,5.0,"I asked the hotel for a market to see and take photos and they recommended Gwangjang market. The market has food shots - seafood, beef, pickles etc. But the best part is a the center it has many food stands where you can get various Korean dishes - spicy rice cake, fish cakes, pajun pancakes etc. It was super cold when I was there but the benches are heated. It is all open air. I had a good time there."
31,4.0,"this is the good place to eat the special Korean food, such as fresh octopus, Korean traditional noodle, Korean green bean cake, rice roll extra...... this place very closed to the subway and easy to find. And this place also have some other Korean food like kimchi and Korean style stuff. this place very interesting . I suggest if you have time must go here.. ................"
32,4.0,"This is one stop I really enjoyed, the market was quite extensive with lots of stores selling Korean dresses, souvenirs, trinkets, food stuff and lots more. And a great thing happened!!!! There where English speaking tourist aids in the market to help you figure out the lay out!"
33,5.0,"It's amazing to get lost in the stalls of this market! So many food options from exotic to tame. The stalls are mostly run by ladies and most make the same thing, with a few that serve other stuff like seafood. Lots of tteokbokki, soondae, gimbap, pajeon, etc. It's a bit overwhelming to decide which stall to go to, but try to look for one with locals eating there, usually a good sign!"
34,5.0,"I always stop by Gwangjang market whenever I'm in Korea (which is every year for the last 4 years.) Koreans are more reserved than friendly. So don't expect smiley vendors. To some, they might come out as rude. Out of the blue, I had one old lady server who stopped by my table, grabbed and poured my 1/8 cup of sesame oil/salt and pepper on my dish--without a hi/smile/nothing. It might look rude but it's more motherly. She's just showing you how to eat it. You can sit on any vacant seats. Order up. It's not expensive. Beware of the boneless chicken feet. It's seasoned like fire chicken/Î∂àÎã≠. It will set your mouth on fire. This market is also famous for bindaetteok/ÎπàÎåÄÎñ°/mung bean pancakes--crunchy, savory, and delicious with rice wine or beer or soju. I also tried fresh octopus. They wiggle and might get stuck in your throat, so chew like a mad man. Have fun!"
35,4.0,"It is a market frequented by locals and tourists, I was told. There are many food stalls to try many types of Korean foods, which is a good thing if you are travelling solo. There are also stalls selling Korean snacks and souvenir."
36,4.0,"This is another well known traditional market but the goods offered are much the same as any other market. the real draw is the food which will be quite exotic to most - I saw ""drug octopus"" and ""Dog Meat Soup"" amongst the very big emphasis on seafood."
37,3.0,"I think this was the most traditional market but I was quite disappointed.  I went on a thursday night around 6pm but 75% of it seemed to be closed down.  There were vast rows of food stalls broken up into sections where they all sell the exact same thing.  For me, I enjoy going to a market so I can see a vast variety of foods and try different things like at a buffet.  I had one of those fried mungbean cakes and then left."
38,4.0,I'd try all the food there if I had the stomach capacity. Quiet in the morning and not crowded at all so you can enjoy a meal in peace.
39,2.0,Seriously it was as if they were all selling the same thing.  Very cramped and busy. Some of the food stunk.  It was however a unique experience.  But I feel there's far better food markets in Seoul. Metro exit 7
40,5.0,Wow what a great spot. The variety of food was great. I had Bibimbap and a cold beer. Apart from food there are so many other stalls there as well.
41,5.0,"There is a saying if you wanted to know about one country, then go to their market. That's true. If you wanted to know more about Korean lifestyle, then go to Gwajang Market. You can enjoy all the traditional and daily food they ever have after work. Try every special dish while enjoying talking with the local."
42,5.0,"If you are travelling alone, or not alone, this is the best place to go to eat. Multiple food stands that you can just walk up to and point. Food is cheap and delicious. Excellent place to taste local food."
43,5.0,"your head will spin at the sheer amount of food options in this place! it's very much alive and buzzing at night, with tourists and locals alike. the lovely ahjummas will try to rival each other to get your attention, walk around to decide which one tickle your fancy. loved the kimbap, look for a stall in a corner with Running Man poster plastered on the wall :)"
44,5.0,I love to explore and experience the culture of the country I visit. This market was so so nice to visit. Not many tourists....lots of Koreans eating and chatting. Old women cooking korean food.  You just sit anywhere you like and eat what seems delicious. If you love markets....food...and new tastes....this market is a must. I warmly recommend this market!! I lived it!I was a bit hard to find but that was bcuz I got lost. Ask ppl and they will show you the directions. It's near the canal and have metro near it. I was on the streets and was looking g for something else initial and got lost. But if you start with visiting this market it's easy to find if you follow the map
45,5.0,Indulge in delicious local food with the locals.Indulge in shopping their local foodstuff and souvenir.This is definitely a great place to absorb the Korean culture.
46,4.0,"You can discover in this market many Korean street food such as mandus, kimchi, gimbap (Korean rice rolls)..."
47,4.0,"Interesting place to visit. But don't be fooled by the aunties at the stall.. They will tell you to come forward (with hand gestures) and make you sit down and eat something from their stall. It is a kind gesture, so it seems hard to say no."
48,5.0,"I have a weak spot for markets, especially ones with food. There is no shortage of that here! Actually came here twice over my weekend visit~ There are a lot of textiles and whatnot, but my focus was more on getting as much delicious and cheap food into my body as possible~! The lady vendors are very nice and engaging, also had a nice experience trying Sannakji here while the ladies were having their staff meal. Definitely recommend."
49,4.0,This is not a typical tourist trap but a place locals come to shop so a great glimpse into everyday Korean life. All different types of stalls in a compact area selling everything from fabric & bedding to food & clothing.
50,4.0,My sole purpose coming here was to find some fabric to take home for my wife. She is constantly making crafty items for others and for sale. The place is quite busy and you have large selections of different foods to choose from. I did not think it was hard to get around however you are to step aside when viewing it you could be pushed on someone else. Lots of cheap eats here if you are on a budget.
51,5.0,"Went to Gwangjang market as part of the day tour I have booked myself for. For anyone who has never been to a live market, well this is the place you have to visit! Lots of stalls varying from sales of textiles to live seafood. Sit yourself down at any of the food stall to enjoy live octopus, freshly fried pancake or bimbibap make on the spot. This market used to be frequented by locals only and as more and more tourists requested to have a feel of the local lifestyle, Gwangjang market became a intersection for the curious tourists and local folks."
52,4.0,This is just approximately 500m from the ibis Ambassador Seoul Dongdaemun Hotel. What a nice surprise!
53,5.0,"Looking for authentic Korean food, don't missed it to know more about South Korea at the oldest traditional street market, Gwangjang."
54,2.0,"It used to be an interesting place but it was too exposed on media. Different kinds of food may look nice on t.v. but the taste wasnt that good. If it is on the way, it is ok to drop by, but no need to plan to visit."
55,4.0,"I had some street food at Gwangjang Market in which I don't normally do because I have a bad stomach. The street food at Gwangjang was so tempting, I just couldn't say NO."
56,5.0,"Gwangjang market is one of the oldest and the largest functioning market in South Korea with around 5000 vendors selling different things like food, textile, etc.Seriously, Gwangjang market is the culmination of the diverse and delicious flavors of Korean street food. There are plethora of food to choose from but don't miss their gimbap and tteokboki (rice cake in spicy sauce). With 20 USD worth of Korean money, you can get a nice lunch of your choice. Gwanjang market offered some of the best street food I have eaten so far. It's a mix of old and new, modern and traditional, all under one roof. As long as you keep your mind open to new flavor and taste, you will likely to enjoy your visit in this market. The market is clean and there are paid toilets (clean as well). Other than food, you can also find textile shops, even traditional medicine ingredients shops. Perfect place to get authentic Korean souvenirs with bargain price."
57,4.0,"In this crowd and popular traditional market offer a good selection of Korean Street Food with a reasonable price such as Korean pan cake, sticky rice cake etc. So it is a one stop shop for Korean street food"
58,5.0,"It's one of the best places to try all the wonderful street food you've seen on TV or vlogs. A food lover and a photographer's paradise. Many of the stalls/vendors are famous, so you can be sure you're eating the best food.It's a must-do experience. The atmosphere is amazing. The food is not only delicious, but cheap, as well."
59,5.0,"This market is odd place, and that quizzicality could be explane like this: modern form of traditional market combined with touristic place.Gwangjang market is famous with two factors: Traditional street foods & Market.Street foods in Gwangjang market is unique. It could be compare with Jeon-Ju, that level high. Locals also visit well for Three famous foods; Ïú°ÌöåYukhoe(Korean beef tartare), ÎÖπÎëêÏ†ÑNokdu-Jeon(Mung bean pancake), and ÎßàÏïΩÍπÄÎ∞•Drug-Gimbap. If you interested in exotic foods, you should try these. Level of difficulties are like follows; Yukhoe >>>>>> Drug-Gimbap > Nokdu-Jeon."
60,5.0,"This is one of very famous street markets with a long history. You can buy fabrics, hanboks(korean traditional clothing), beddings, among many other things! There is very famous eatery alley where sells many foods so you can taste with cheap price!"
61,3.0,I went there to buy the traditional custom to my family. I found a verity of products however they don't speak english and that make it hard to communicate. In addition to that they don't accept credit card only cash. There is no souvenir shop which I found it strange.I have doubts about the food safety and hygiene. I don't encourage anyone to eat there.
62,3.0,"When i entered the market, it smelled really bad ( a mix of different seafood and meat and who knows what else).And the variety of food is also not thaaat great.But here you can buy real authentic korean snacks (tokkpoki and sundae...), while other food-streets sometimes try to adjust to the tourists. And also the building itself is not that huge. So that could be an advantage if you don't have that much time.SInce the place is very crowded, eating there (standing and sometimes there is a chair) is not really comfortable.There are a few ""restaurants"" with seats and tables, but the waiter or ahjummas there are not really friendly...(maybe i was just unlucky).By the way the whole market is roofed, so you can even go there on a rainy day (like me)."
63,3.0,"We come here on Sunday morning for a breakfast. Most of.the shop is closed on Sunday.  I think Korea is a very relaxing city, they don't mind to earn less money, but they mind to lose family life.  If you come here on Sunday, you can find some food unpalatable and unpleasant price."
64,3.0,"One of the most famous traditional markets in Seoul. It is quite an interesting experience to walk through the markets, lots of eateries in the open area selling deep fried green bean cake, kimbap, noodles and so on. Gwangjang Market is not far from Dongdaemun. If taking metro, get off at Jongro 5-ga station, Exit 8."
65,1.0,"Whole food is so dirty and overpriced. I live in Seoul for 28years but the food quality is the worst I have ever been. Disgusting smell in everywhere. I¬†was¬†momentarily¬†under¬†the¬†illusion that¬†I¬†was¬†in¬†a¬†North Korea or some uncivilized country. Cheap-looking Hanbok(Korean traditional cloth), slice the foods with hands that handled the money, rude and unpolite...etc Maybe it is funny to foreign tourists who want to experience uncivilized culture."
66,5.0,"The bustling Gwangjang Market is perfect for foodies eager to sample a myriad of Korean food. This historical market is home to bindaetteok (mung bean pancakes), mayak kimbap (addictive rice rolls), and yukhoe (Korean-style beef tartare). It also has sections dedicated to hanbok and other stuff."
67,4.0,"Unfortunately I didn't make it to see the whole market. I just past my time there until the guided tour for Jongmyo Shrine started. They're very close, so it can be combined with a bit more time. I mainly walked the textile part and food court. There are tailors for hanboks but also traditional bed linen. The food seems authentic Korean to me too, lots of choices.  Running Man 'run' thru this once which the store owners didn't hide either."
68,4.0,"If you want Korean street food, this is the place you'll find it. Things are overpriced almost by mandate and usually served for two or more so feel free to haggle if you're in the mood, especially if you're buying half portions (i.e. for one) or multiple foods from one vendor. You can buy things to go or just sit down and eat right there. The other offshoots are also interesting to explore for some of the wares they sell."
69,3.0,"To be fair, i visited during the lunar new year period, which was why so many stalls were closed. Did get to eat a couple of items i.e. noodle soup and mini kimbab"
70,4.0,"Bring Cash, and have fun. You can buy almost anything. I was a little suspicious of the designer items for sale everywhere. I don't know much about spotting fakes, so it's buy at your own risk. What I did buy was a traditional dress for my niece that is just beautiful. I also tried some of the street food. I couldn't tell you what I ate, but it was good."
71,4.0,"Fun to walk through and experience the sights, smells, and sounds of this market.There is also a whole floor of fabrics (?2nd floor) if you're into that sort of thing.Main level has an assortment of cooked food vendors, fresh seafood, clothing, assorted souvenirs.  I walked through at lunch time and many locals seemed to be enjoying their lunch right there.  Nice experience."
72,5.0,I didn't buy anything from the market...But the small alleys close by were really cool. The market sells so many types of different items it's unbelievable. Definitely worth a see :)
73,3.0,"Had been to the ones in busan and daegu, this one offers much less, especially comparing to the one in daegu. The only reason I would go again would be the food stalls (cut noodles with wontons are really good), otherwise I won't bother."
74,4.0,"Love going to Gwangjang market for breakfast, you will be spoilt for choices. Pumpkin and red bean porridge, kimchi pancake, barley rice, spicy rice cake and so much more your tummy will be more than satisfied. Go to the alleys to look at the huge range of kimchi and other raw foods available for sale."
75,5.0,"You don't even have to come to shop if you don't want to. What this place should be known for is the street food. Open early afternoon to late at night, there are always people here eating and shopping. Truly the best place in Seoul to get a taste of all of the street food under a roofed place. You'll be able to find local favorites such as mandoo, ramyun, pancakes, and sausages here all in one convenient place."
76,5.0,Walking through this market is a treat for the eyes. Sitting at the tables and eating with the locals is a treat for your stomach and your mind. Everyone is friendly and will help you get what you want. Wonderful food. Never a bad dish.
77,3.0,"This is located near Insadong and both places can be visited on the same morning.  Stopped by here to have some kimchi pancakes as well as steamed crab.  Food stalls abound on the ground floor,  as well as bed linens, bolsters and Korean souvenirs.In the huge covered area, on the second floor, you can find lots of clothes stalls, with apparel that are mostly made in China.  It's more expensive than what I have seen for the same stuff in Shanghai, but there is great variety here, from jeans to blouses and jackets.  Some of the staircases can be steep and slippery, especially if they are wet, so be careful.The third floor is devoted to hanbuk shops, selling the traditional Korean dress, for both children and adults.  Do haggle though if you are interested in getting one.Also bought a box of lovely strawberries from an eldery lady on the ground floor.  Do also check out the toy store in one corner - it was selling a light sabre for S$55 and stormtroppers for S$150 - as well as the gardening and fish stalls near the outside.  There are also a row of pharmacies at the far end."
78,5.0,"The market is full of eateries, stalks, small restaurants, grocery shops, clothes shops and many more.  Prepare to spend half a day there to experience the local delicacies.  Gwangjang Market is very popular among locals and foreigners."

82,5.0,"Whilst everyone flocks to Namdaemun, I steer my visitors to Gwangjang. It's a more manageable size and can easily be accessed by a stroll along the Chonggyecheon Stream.The second floor is THE place to buy and get hanbok (traditional Korean dress). Seoulites of a certain caliber come here just for this. It is a photographers dream up there and a foodies paradise in the central circus of the covered market."
83,4.0,"I like this market for its diversified products from expensive to low range prices. The local foods are alike their countryside dishes so good, so moderate prices. Souvenirs are the best, bargain for wholesale price. Cameras, scarves, clothings you name it. Stop by a Starbuck for beverages, sweets same as home. You can spend 3-4 hours wandering from shopping to window shopping is an enjoyable time.I love this market."
84,4.0,"This traditional market sold many kind of hanbook (traditional costume of korean). If you also looking for korean cotton , you can find them here a lot.

85,5.0,"You will see real local atmosphere in this market. Sadly the price nowadays became rather stiff since there are a lot of tourists nowadays after it got famous, But still they provide us with delicious local foods at reasonable..? price. You must eat alive octopus, raw-beef, drug kimbap and... you will see!"
86,4.0,"Such an interesting place just to wander around, even if the goods aren't what you'd want to buy.  You can see all the traditional Korean clothes, fabrics and sundry clothing, household goods, some souvenirs and lots of street foods.  There is a whole aisle of small restaurants and many even have an english menu. They looked pretty clean and I sat down at a place with huge stack of mandu (dumplings) and had a delicious warming dumpling soup, Even the bench was heated that I sat on and you got free tea that you helped yourself from a bottle, with your meal-all for W5500. A fun experience.  The market is a short walk along Chongycheon stream from Dongdaemun."

89,5.0,"For some reason, the name of this market (along with a couple of other sights) is alternately spelled with a G or a K.  On my map it was spelled with a K and the sign over the market itself was spelled ‚ÄúKwang Jang Market‚Äù.  It caused me a little confusion, so I thought I‚Äôd just pass that info on.The market itself is magical.  I‚Äôve been to a lot of food markets over the years and this one is definitely up there in terms of intensity as far as your senses are concerned.Assuming you‚Äôre traveling during the shoulder seasons (Spring, Fall), the time to catch this market at its peak is just after the sun sets and the store/street lights begin to come on.  Just walk right in and get sucked into the swarm of humanity.  It‚Äôs a complete sensory overload and as you approach the nexus of the rows of food stalls, you‚Äôll find it difficult to remain stationary.  The human tides pulsing all around you will push you in one direction after another.  No photograph could possibly do it justice; I ended up having to video-tape it in order to best capture it.This is one of a few instances where you will genuinely lament that you don‚Äôt have a Korean friend or travel mate who knows how to grab a seat, knows what the food is and how to order it (unless you know Korean, you‚Äôll be reduced to pointing and praying for the most part), what sauce you should dip what food into, figuring out the cost, etc.I‚Äôve rated it excellent because not only will you get a good, genuine Korean meal sitting alongside them, you‚Äôll also get a sensory rush that will stay with you long after you‚Äôve come home, but most importantly, you‚Äôll get a glimpse into the very essence of Koreans and their relationship with food.  Outside of being invited into the home of someone hosting a family get together, this is the closest you‚Äôll ever get to a candid portrait of Koreans as their omnivorous selves.There are assorted shops selling various items along the periphery, but they‚Äôll be little more than background scenery if you come at the right time."

Also, the best place to find hanbok or souvenirs that may be different from the ones you find in Insadong. Tips:Make sure to come in an empty stomach. Plenty of delicious food, and very authentic. Don't forget to try bindaettoek, the specialtyIt's probably better to bring a korean friend that can explain the different food"
91,4.0,This market is only about 15 mins walk from the place I stayed. I went there twice during my stay in Korea and it can be one of my favorite places in Korea! There are plenty of food vendors you can choose from. It's definitely a great spot to try local food!! You can also check those cute stores that sell many traditional bags and purses. A must go on the list!!
92,4.0,"If you like street food, you should definitely come to this market. you can even eat raw octopus there."
93,5.0,"I was just gonna go here to see what I can buy.  But Parts Unknown season 5 premiered on the same night I arrived in Korea and Anthony Bourdain enjoyed his food here.  So I decided to come here just for the food.  It was heaven...but it might have been more of a hellish temperature. lol...with all the food being made right in front of everyone, this place gets really hot.I had soondae, kimbap, various kinds of pancakes and other fried stuff that to this day I don't know the name of.  They were all good."
94,4.0,"You will literally find anything here. From pins and magnets to tailors and cloth shops to pig heads and butcher shops. This place is a fun visit if you are into discovering places. Perhaps not suited with little children. If you are good at making deals you can buy stuff, but make sure to turn the price to your advantage^^ TIP: Once done here you can take a stroll along  Cheonggyecheon stream."
95,4.0,"This is a great place to view all the great food that Seoul has to offer. It is usually really busy and you can find fresh food, prepared food, clothes and souveniors under the roof. Haven't had a bad meal there yet."
96,4.0,"This is a large market where one could easily get spend the whole morning/afternoon at. Every time I am in Seoul, I find myself visiting it at least twice during my trip. Love just walking around to look at the beautiful hanbok and accessories on sale. You can also find every day kitchenware, like ramen pots. Of course, one should not forget the famous food streets, where locals and tourists rub shoulders as they sit on simple wooden benches while dining. Some halal-friendly food options include ""mayak"" kimbap, pumpkin soup, raw mixed seafood platter and barley bimbimbap."
97,4.0,"Anyone who plans to go to Gwangjang Market must come with an empty stomach, empty backpack and a few thousand KRW. Get ready to try all sorts of street food. Souvenirs are very cheap here compared to other places. Dresses, shirts, bags, shorts, caps - you can find anything you want here at a good price.Two things about the market that impressed me the most. The market is really clean, no rubbish, no foul smell at all. And the market was very well managed, the stalls/shops were organized well. Most food stalls had a number, making it easy for everyone to know which one to go to.It's where Seoulites dine and socialize too. This is one of the best places to experience life in Seoul."
98,4.0,"Gwangjang Market is located near a subway station and you need around an hour to explore all the stalls. There is a place that sells Korean hanbok, it consists of many stores located in one place. I also heard there's this secondhand clothes market but unfortunately I didn't go there. I tried the famous bindaetteok and Korean pancake (with veggies and meat). A Korean natives who guided me said that the place where I had my pancake is the place where the American director Tim Burton ate the same meal. I can't remember the name but the place is quite small and you have to queue to get inside. Also, you will be asked to leave when you are done eating because the queue is extremely long!"
99,3.0,"I usually think twice when I post negative reviews. I gotta say, since most of the reviewers seem pretty happy about the market I should make a reivew on different perspectives to let you decide if it's worth speding your money on.It's a huge market, the whole marketplace preserves the 70-80's sentimental atmosphere. Great to watch street food sizzling on the pan right in front of you. They will cut the food right in front of you. It's crowded and lively. Just be aware of rip offs at the food stalls(the rice cake and blood sausage kinds),  when you order food in English. You probably wouldn't notice the rip offs if you can't read or speak Korean. They also rip off on Korean tourists as well. Common example 1: They will give  different, way higher price for non-Korean customers. Common example 2: If you speak Korean, they will ask if you want to ""taste"" ""just a bit of"" something that you didn't order. It sounds like they are being generous and giving you some samples of it, it may sound like asking you to purchase a mini-sample of it. They will actually give you a generous sample portion. And you will get charged for full extra dish. The general set price (for Korean speaking locals) are expensive to begin with. The quality don't match the price. You will end up paying full-service restaurant food without knowing it ahead. Sanitation I have no clue."
100,4.0,"It was my aimless walking that I stumbled upon this market. It was late afternoon like 5pm. A huge market with many sections, which includes separate lanes focused on selling textiles, crockery, etc etc etc.. But what surprised me was a FRESH seafood market too where you see all sorts of fish and shellfish laid on their tables. Also, they have multitude of preserved foods (like the condiments we get on the table when you order authentic Korean foods). A further surprise is that at the various junctions when the lanes collide, there are many mini-stalls selling food cooked in front of your eyes. Popular ones include seafood pancakes, toeppokki, pork head ears, etc... blood sausages, and many more.Great experience to sit and eat here with a glass of Soju to soak up the local culture and lifestyles"
101,3.0,I really liked this food market atmosphere enjoying tasty Korean food and buying other food for to go! However this place is narrow and crowded! So ambiance is very hectic and somehow just OK!
102,4.0,"Was excited to visit this because of the reviews re Gwangjang being a foodie place, if you like cheap and varied street food. And I do, very much. I went on a weekday morning, so it wasn't as busy as it can be at night. From the entrance to the center aisle, there were so many stalls selling clothes, packed food, and little Korean souvenirs. Prices were much cheaper than in Myeongdong market or in the malls, of course, so if you're looking to bring home some stuff for family and friends at home, I would highly suggest this place.When I got to the center portion, I saw all the food stalls who were only just preparing to open for the day. This was around 10:30AM. Again, if you like cheap and good street food, this is the place to be. Stalls and stalls of traditional Korean fare. I chose a stall that sold noodle soup. As a bonus, they had an English menu. For 5000 Won (roughly $5), I got their specialty noodle dumpling soup. The noodles and the dumpling were handmade. They even cut and cooked my noodles before my eyes. Everything was served hot and fresh. It also came with two sides: kimchi and another vegetable dish. And the taste was fantastic! Felt bad that I couldn't stay longer, as I wanted to sample as many of the stalls as I could.I would highly recommend Gwangjang to budget travellers or people who like checking out markets and sampling street fare."
103,5.0,"fave traditional market in Seoul as its located strategically between City Hall and Jongno area, and it has a lot of food that you can try on . i especially love the mung bean pancake and the fresh bibimbap where I feel its very local. You will see many shops will have some photos with Korean star as Running Man show actually was filmed in there last year ."
104,5.0,"This market is a must go place & you can try local food such as pancake, deokbbokki, kimchi..etc..you can eat like a king here. You can also buy colorful Hanbok here for those who likes Korean costume."
105,5.0,"Make the effort to go and see this market, find a stall and sit down and eat some dukbokki (rice rolls in chilli paste sauce) and watch the locals chowing down on food, its really an eye opener here and some of the food they are selling is interesting and so much colour, smell and flavour everywhere!I recommend taking the time to find this market - well worth it"
106,5.0,"This market is full of local food. It is very lively and got a large variety of things for sales. There are a large number of kimchi shops, offering many different kinds of kimchi. The foods are relatively cheap. If you wanted to eat here, there aren‚Äôt much English signs, you would rely on body language and just have to guess what they are and accept the price they asked (but usually are not expensive)"
107,3.0,"i have this peculiar interest about markets. i love watching people shop and make interaction in market, and you can see the ""real"" people of a city in the market. gwangjang is a very huge market, i got lost again and again (that i enjoyed!). the food market were awesome, so many people and delicious traditional food. i stepped to 2nd floor,where they sold beautiful fabrics for handbok. and finally i found the place i really wanted to visit: the section of 2nd hand clothes! i didn't buy anything, but i really enjoyed the view of great, vintage clothes and shoes (mostly leather and fur, since it was autumn), and the young people with trendy styles, bargain for the cool stuffs. if i were seoul citizen, surely i'd buy my clothes in this place. you can reach this section from the east gate."
108,3.0,"As a solo male traveller, I only found this place mildly interesting.  I was not buying a Hanbuk or any other clothes or souvenirs, but it was interesting to walk along the side streets and see glimpses of local life.Truth be told, most of the souvenirs etc can easily be found at other areas in Seoul.  The same can be said for the street snacks, though there seems to be more pancake stalls congregated here. Good to pass a couple of hours, especially as it it also near Dongdaemun retail markets."
109,4.0,"This is my first time visiting Gwangjang Market in Seoul.  Surprisingly, so many traditional shops there, like Korean clothese (Hanbuk), Korean snacks, fruits, and cooking utensils, ...etc.Amazingly you can find lots of snacks/food stalls, you can try Korean dumplings or 'blood intestine', or noodles, or Korean pizza...etc.All price are very reasonable and good experience.I bought some Korean bowls, chopsticks, instant noodles cooking pot, some clothes for mother, some Korean snacks for dad, and dried persimmons (yummy).  ^o^Must go again next time."
110,5.0,"While some other visitors to Seoul may prefer a more dressed up experience, I personally loved Gwangjang Market.  It is a perfect mix of South Korean soul, shopping, and culture.  With dozens of outdoor vendors mixed in with many major department stores, any visitor to Gwangjang is sure to find what they're looking for.  And even if you don't plan on bringing home any souvenirs, just a walk around is a worthwhile experience.Plus, no knowledge of Korean is required to navigate around.  And so if you're spending any time at all in South Korea, Gwanjang Market is a must-see."
111,4.0,"With it's rich history, Gwangjang market is a veritable Seoul experience without the glam and glitter of the food courts of the major department stores in Seoul. You will experience a slice of the scent of fresh fish being sold , the muggy smell of the fabric section, the various colors of the food imitations for display, but you will be rewarded with the sound and smell of the delectable food being prepared by the Ajummas of Gwangjang Market. The food is superb , the ambiance raw and rustic. A must visit in Seoul !"
112,5.0,"It is a must try to eat here. It's a clean market and very affordable. Gwangjang Market is famous for its food more than anything else. You can find Gimbap, tteokbukki, bindaetteok and pork blood sausage. OMG, I love this place!"
113,3.0,I passed by here when I decided to walk around during my first day in Seoul. There are a lot of interesting things to see and a lot of places to eat though I didn't really try any.
114,5.0,"What an amazing place! loads of mouth watering local dishes here, with a buzzing atmosphere. Pancakes were the best, and lots of different Kimchi options up and down the market. Very reasonably priced and everybody just sits together at shared tables. Try the Korean wine in the small green bottles. It looks like milk, is fizzy, but delicious, and goes great with the food."
115,4.0,"I found much better places for shopping than Gwangjang Market, so initially I wasn't impressed. Until, that is, I realized what a gold mine this place is for street food! I'm dreaming about the delicious types of jeon that I tried there."
116,5.0,"Mung bean pancakes, bibimbap, knife-cut noodles, cold noodles (nangmyeon), dumplings, rice cakes (tteokbokki) and so much more could be found at this great market.I only went there for the food even though there are shops selling all kinds of things. So this review will be only about the food area of the market. There is plenty to choose from and I went there often as my hotel was very nearby. The food is authentic. Language barrier is not a problem as they are very used to tourists.To get there, take the Subway Line 1 to Jongno 5-ga station and go out using Exit 9. Alternatively, take Subway Line 2 or Line 5 to Euljiro 4-ga station and go out using Exit 4. The second option requires a slightly longer walk - go straight on from the exit, straight across the highway at the traffic light intersection and the market building will be directly in front of you once you have cleared the intersection."
117,4.0,"Gwangjang Market is one lively place to come to. I was not sure in the first place what to expect but when I arrived, I was taken away by how lively it was. I came in the evening around 6-ish. The place was huge. They have stores selling fresh kimchi, marinated crabs, and stuff. But the real deal was the food stores that were selling food. It was awesome! There were so many food stores and so much variety of food that it was so difficult to settle down to one store to eat. But one thing you must try is the ""mung bean pancake"". Most, if not all the stores have this stone grinding machine that grinds the mung bean and they mix the paste with some vegetables and fry it into a pancake. The pancake costs KRW4,000 in the Gwangjang Market (while the same thing costs KRW8,000 in Namdaemun Market). They also have pig blood intestine glutinous rice. I thought it was a very interesting food to try. They cut it into pieces and you dip it into some ""chilli salt"" and once you eat it, you will feel very satisfied with the taste. It was not yucky or anything. It was chewy and a little salty (due to dipping it into the salt). Overall it tastes really good. I would recommend Gwangjang Market at least once in your trip to Seoul. Obviously, I came back here twice!"
118,4.0,"I wanted to try the local food in this particular market , and boy was I not disappointed. The market is typical , but the atmosphere is authentic ! The food superb ! The ajumas are very nice to me as I had too many questions regarding the interesting looking spread of food they have for tasting ! A must visit , mashita !"
119,4.0,"The market is located near Subway line 1 Jongno-5 Ga Station.  Going straight off Exit 8, you'll see the market on your left. Gwangjang Market is not huge, so this is a very relaxing attraction where one can spend an hour checking out different kind of stores, and have a few snacks. The whole market is one story, so it's an easy walk for anyone.To avoid the crowd, try to go after meal time at Gwangjang Market. I went on a Monday afternoon after the lunch crowd. So the atmosphere is very relaxing. All the ajima, agasi, even grandma and grandpa manning the eatery stools and stores are very friendly. And seats available everywhere. I also checked out the side streets. Again, almost all the store people are extremely friendly. I am crafty and a sewer, so I had an eye feast on all the beautiful fabric display. I inquired some prices for dried seaweed and found the price to be good. A grandma even showed me how to tell the grade of gingsing. I tried to get some silverware from this one kitchen supply store. The young man at the store speaks perfect English. After inquiring the price, I knew his price is more expensive than the supermarket. But being polite, I still bought some to support local business. I am from California where everyone including foreigners and US president pay the same price. Guess Seoul is nothing like California. I'm not sure why Koreans are afraid of ajima. I find all the middle aged and older Korean here at Gwangjang Market are very honest and friendly. Would definitely be back for those seaweed before leaving Korea."
