0,5.0,"I walked past this Seoul City Hall Seosomun building and curiosity made me go inside and up to the 13the floor. The view of Jeongdong in this observatory is awesome. It seems like you don't have to buy any beverage or dessert in the cafe inside to see the view.  I walked in and looked at the view and took pictures. There are also historical pictures of the area in a nearby small room and a brochure to tell you the history of this place. It is not on the main path of things to see, but it is definitely worth checking out."

But there was just high floor in building rather than observatory, I think. The inside was crowded many people, and coffee price was cheap."
2,4.0,"This a small cafe that overlooks Deoksu Palace that I didn’t know about even after 14 years of living in Korea!Positives: 1) A great view of Deoksu Palace 2) Decent coffee 3) Close to the station Negatives: 1) The seats aren’t very comfortable 2) The cafe is a bit small 3) A lot of tourists come just for the view so it isn’t the quietest cafe.Jeongdong Observatory is located on the 13th floor of Seoul City Hall Seosomun building. When you come out of City Hall Station (Lines 1 and 2), you’ll make an immediate right into an alley or you will pass it. You will keep walking and it will be the Seosomun Building on your right (not on your left)."
3,5.0,"This place was on the 13th floor of an annex of the Seoul City Hall. I had originally read about a coffee shop with a view in Seoul City Hall, but couldn't find it. This place is not in the main part of the City Hall! Head down the small street at the side of the Deoksugung Palace (you should see Dunkin Donuts on the corner) and you'll quickly see the right building. Take the lift up to the 13th floor and you'll arrive.This coffee shop has great panoramic views over the Deoksugung Palace, with more modern buildings and mountains in the background. The coffee was also pretty decent, and the prices didn't seem to be inflated at all. There were only a couple of other people in there when I went mid-morning, so it was a relaxing spot, too. I would definitely recommend as a resting point either just before or just after visiting Deoksugung Palace."
