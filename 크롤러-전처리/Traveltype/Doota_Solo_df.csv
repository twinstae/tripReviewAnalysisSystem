1,3.0,"Shopping mall located inside the Doosan white building close to Dongdaemun. Food court in the basement. Shopping mall floors up to and including 6th floor. Signs say some duty free floors higher up, but I didn't go that high in building so not sure what is there. Has a coffee bean coffee shop with outdoor terrace sitting"

3,1.0,"This is a fairly large mall in the Dongdaemun district that sells a lot of clothing, food and cosmetics. The bottom few floors are offer a lot of casual clothing for both men and women with a food court located in Basement 1. There are generally a lot of Chinese tourists and what irritated me and my group is that majority of the people working in Doota don't speak English and often assumed we can understand Mandarin. When we told them that we don't understand Mandarin, some of them rolled their eyes like it was a burden to them.One shop in particular called Drawings had a lady snap at me a couple of times cause I don't understand Korean or Chinese and she insisted I pay KRW10,000 (USD10) for getting a TINY bit of my foundation on a dress I tried on as the clothing apparently needed to go for 'special laundry' service. I thought that was ridiculous and offered to have the dressed wiped with a wet towel but she acted like it was the biggest problem ever and started throwing a tantrum at me in front of everyone (mind you, everything was in Mandarin and again, I actually have no idea what she was saying to me).Got scammed out of KRW10,000 and I decided to pay up cause she looked like she was about to go ape-crazy on me. I left the mall with mixed-feelings of being treated like I'm some uncivilised Chinese tourist. Worst shopping experience ever and it totally spoiled my mood to ever shop in Dongdaemun and Doota Mall ever again."

6,4.0,"If you are into shopping and fashion then you should definitely visit Doota. Keep in mind that prices are not that cheap and can get as expensive as a department store. Even though I don't spend too much money here, I enjoy checking out the current fashion trend in Korea. There are unique designers and each of them have their own style. The building goes from basement to the 6th floor and each floor is categorized of women, men, shoes, bags, accessories, kids and food court. The mall is open till late at night so I roam around when I'm jetlagged and can't sleep. I recommend that you visit early in the morning before all the tourists come shopping around noon."
7,4.0,"Another Fashion Mall with Duty Free from the fourth level up. A good place for branded items shopper. However, two levels featuring K Culture and K Wave were closed."
8,3.0,"I used to love shopping at Doota 7-8 years ago but this trip was shocked with the prices. I saw prices ranged from 46,000 Won to 600,000 Won where as other shopping centre nearby were selling fashion that much cheaper than that perhaps ranged from 9,000 Won - 58,000 Won. To be fair, those that cost more than 100,000 Won with good quality and design.One of the top I bought in Doota for 58,000 Won but it was priced 15,000 Won in another retail shop from the next building.... Tips:1. Compare prices from the nearby shopping centre before you purchase anything.2. Many shops practice ""No Fitting Room"" policy, so make sure their free-size is your free-size. I couldn't fit into some pants despite it stated ""Free size"".3. Some shops actually provide fitting room for you but watch out for the magical slimming mirrors - I looked slimmer and taller from that mirror (hence looked better with any clothes that I tried on) which was different from my hotel's mirror and any other mirrors from my home. (This applied to other places in Seoul too, not just Doota). Food wise, the food was delicious at the basement level."
