0,4.0,"Seonyudo Park offers a place to escape the hustle and bustle of downtown Seoul - right in the middle of the city - on an island in the Han River. The park offers an interesting and clever transformation of a disused water purification plant into a contemporary botanic garden. As well as the display gardens, there are a number of paths around the island, a cafe, and plenty of places to sit and have a picnic away from crowds. This would be a great place to bring kids for a run around, as there is no traffic, no bicycles and no smoking on the island. Access by walking across the bridge from either Hapjeong Station or Dangsan Station. Alternatively, buses run from both these stations, stopping right on the bridge, at the entrance to the island. There is no cost other than your transport to get there."
1,4.0,This is a unique park. It used to be a water treatment plant. Since I used to work in water treatment this park was extra appealing to me. I like how they were creative in reusing the facilities such as turning storage tanks into fish ponds. The park is on an island and a great place for a picnic. It is peaceful and well-landscaped.
2,4.0,Set on an island in the Han River the park provides welcome open green space and leisure opportunities especially for locals but also visitors with some free time looking to escape the constant hub hub of down town SeoulTake Metro Line 9 to Seonyudo - follow the signs from Exit 2 and it is a good 15 minute walk
3,4.0,Great place to escape crowds of tourists and relax after a long day of sightseeing. It's a quiet park with mysterious atmosphere. I went there during sunset and tha was the best decision: the views were really beatiful.
4,4.0,"When I went, it was early morning during the hottest summer days. The cicada sounds were deafening, so I toured the whole park in 45 minutes. A lot of areas were cordoned off, so there wasn't much to do. However, I found a Before I Die exhibit there which was rather interesting to look at. There're blanks for you to fill in the thing you want to accomplish before you die.  Other than that, there were greenhouses and other horticulture related structures. Personally, I'm not very interested in horticulture, but they did have a variety of plants and flowers. It would be better if the park was better maintained, though."
