0,3.0,They also have free guided tours at few intervals of day.Local wear traditional attire while visiting this place.
1,5.0,"Arrive on the hour so you can see the changing of the guard.  Arrival it looked relatively small, but it’s deceptive and gradually reveals other buildings and depth to the complex.  A great few hours to learn more about the history of Seoul/Korea.  This amazing complex is surrounded by the modern city."
2,5.0,The palace is really nice. Has a museum in there too. Lots of lovely Korean kids dressed up in traditional wear.
3,4.0,"Very nice place to visit while in Seoul. Historical site, not to crowded. Spend nice time there. Recomend it for everyone visiting even if they have little time. However is not worth to wait for the change of guards."
4,4.0,"It was built prior to Forbidden City of China, but a bit smaller and maybe a bit simpler?Overall, enjoyed the changes of guard, even though they were all actors. As the biggest of the 5 palaces in Seoul, it is still a must to do list, but may not need to visit the other palaces after this one."
5,4.0,Interesting visit to the palace. Lots of other tourists in rented Hanboks to make the place more fun to visit. It would have been better with more signage to share more about the different areas of the palace and its history. Else it’s a nice stroll that takes about 2-3 hours. Nice shopping and food surrounding the palace too.
6,4.0,If you dress traditional you don’t need to pay the entry. You can rent a dress in houses next to the palace. And have a photo shoot. Really great!50% is dressed like that. With makes it like you are in history....flash back.
7,5.0,Worth a trip to see this attraction. Just check opening hours.  We arrived at 6.30 and it was closed so had to waiting until it re opened at 7pm. Also the late opening did not allow entry to the two Koreans I was with.  After 7pm is for foreign visitors and older Koreans so we found out on the day.
8,4.0,As I was travelling for business I did not have much time to sight see. My colleague took me to the palace to breathe in some Korean heritage. It was a lovely experience and I learned a lot about Korean history in a short (1 hour) time. Glad I didn't miss out!
9,5.0,"So serene and beautiful. Tons of foreigners wearing rented hanbok were fun made the dusty grounds very colorful and complimented the gorgeous buildings. Wonderful history lesson. The folk museum is right next door, too. Also well worth it."
10,5.0,This place is well worth a visit—an important historical site. Grounds are well cared and buildings are really impressive—especially the main throne building.
11,3.0,The palace is at the end of a long boulevard and located in front of some nice hills. Good for photos and watching the changing of guards.
12,4.0,Palace within palace which for this palace there is chinese character written around it and kinda confuse me but still a great place to spend time and taking memories down the road by wearing their costumes which can be rented
13,5.0,"Enjoy the great palace of Korean empire and its pharaonic buildings! Don't miss the guard change, every couple of hours in a day!"
14,5.0,"I went twice as I really enjoyed the visit.  3000 KRW for the entrance fees.  I was there for the change of guards and that was a must-see.  There also provide free guides for English, Chinese and Japanese at specific time.  You need 2 hours to really enjoy all the sites.  Totally worth it."
15,5.0,"Always great to see history.  This palace was originally built in the 1300's.  We were on a city tour with a tour guide and they provided  so much insite that you may have missed if visiting on your own.The buildings were built with such detail work and awesome colors.  Lots of space to move about even though there is quite a crowd.  There is a changing of the guard to see at specified times.  Worth the wait to see it, but this is a ceremonal bit, not true militiary/security.I would call this a must see in Seoul.  However, I would suggest if you have limited time, to see only one palace.  The Changdeokgung Palace is almost exactly the same as this one.If you have time, exit the front of the place and walk straight out and see the statues of King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sunshin.  These are two very important figures on the history of Korea.There is also a little known museum dedicated to the two of them under the statues.  This is a nice secret spot to learn more  history.The shops around the palace rent clothing of the era and many visitors rent the clothing and visit the palace.  I am told if you were clothing from the era, you enter free.  FYI, the entrance fee is very minimal.I highly reccomend visiting one of the palaces if visiting Seoul.  A visit to the Buddist Temple is also a must!"
16,5.0,Big and nice place to spend 3-4 hoursYou can see the most beautiful traditional clothesand I had an opportunity to see and hear amazing  traditional singers
17,4.0,"the palace is large but most of the rooms are closed hence one gets to see the outer structures only. a self guide facility should be made available to understand the buildings better, fairly large and hence needs an easy 2-3 hours visit"
18,5.0,"Great experience, the guard change is really interesting.The contrast with the modern city, build just some steps away, make it more interesting"
19,4.0,"You can see the culture and Heritage of Korea by visiting this place, Korean Royal Food and Traditional Dance , this Palace is near the lake and mostly crowded with travellers and visitors from various placed"
20,5.0,"Joseon Kingdom Palace. One of the nicest looking palace. This is like the miniature of Forbidden Kingdom, smaller, but you don't need to spend a lot of time visiting all the places, 3-4 hrs are enough. Better to visit around 1.30pm, and see that changing of the guard procession at 2pm and enter the palace afterwards.You can also see plenty of visitors wearing Han Bok, although mostly are not koreans. But if you manage to find a pretty one, don't hesitate to ask for a picture. Hehehe"
21,5.0,"Large palace complex - the traditional wood buildings are beautifully painted with geometric floral motifs. The main throne room is beautifully decorated. Be sure to see changing of the guards ceremony, held twice, at 11am and 2 pm. It is a lot of fun with a lot of pageantry. The guards dressed in colorful traditional clothes, carry weapons and try to look fearsome. They are accompanied by a military band and other guards/men carrying colorful standards. The guards are very popular photo props."

27,4.0,"The architecture is mesmerizing. Even can relate to China and Japan's architectures, still it has its own identity"
28,5.0,"The Palace complex was interesting, easy to take 1-2 hours and see everything. The architecture was very interesting and tours were available. Great venue for pictures.  It was about 45 minutes from Downtown so Metro, Uber, or Cab."
29,5.0,"The Palace surprised me: it is huge and very interesting, I had a guided tour with my workgroup and all of us were fascinated."
30,5.0,Had a lot to take in and a short time to do it. didn't get to see it all.  but the architecture and vibrant colors of the buildings and the fall foliage was wonderful. for 3000 KRW it was well worth the visit.
31,4.0,"Historical places, nice to take picture as a tourist ( landmark) Also you get to try hanbok( korea traditional cloth)"
32,5.0,The palace has a ceremony for the changing of the guards.  And the architecture is breathless. Definitely need to check it out when In Seoul.
33,5.0,Great 1/2 day trip staring with watching changing of the Guards. Wonderful grounds and beautiful buildings. Top it off with a visit to the Korean Folk Lore Museum.
34,3.0,This palace is definitely worth visiting. Be prepared to walk as it is big. Changing ceremony is good but do note that it is supremely busy so try and find a quiet time or go early.
35,4.0,Was business trip with a little pleasure mixed in.  Found the palace of great interest.  Place is clean and in the center of the old part of town.   Easy parking.  Traffic to get there is bad.   But traffic in The city is bad everywhere.
36,3.0,"A short trip, this place needs a guide.Many tour groups create challenges for accessThe historical significance is important but lost as few English signs or information boards.An English map is available free near front gate office"

38,4.0,"this place was quiet comfy for me but it made me sleepy being here for 1 hours. i like the environment, very clean and nice."
39,4.0,"This is my second visit and learned more each time I visit, The gardens at the back were closed off this time due to some renovations,but still a lot of area to cover that is still open to public,"
40,4.0,"We enjoyed touring this palace, though it should be noted that most of it has been rebuilt in the last decade or so.  The experience was enhanced by the tourists dressing up in local costume and floating about."
41,5.0,Please come here and you can pose around the palace. Just take note that they have few gates. If you're not coming from the front gate make sure to ask the guard how you can go to the front gate. I was quite lost at that time 🤣 don't forget to rent your hanbok!
42,5.0,Excellent destination for tourists to experience South Korean culture and history. Visited during the summer weather and it made for a spectacular day out exploring the palace and learning about South Korean history. Lots to see and experience including cultural performances
43,5.0,I like the place because it is historic and well designed and have beautiful buildings and landscape
44,4.0,"At 13h there is a free English guided tour which passes by the main buildings of the palace. Make sure to take the tour, because otherwise it is just a collection of old buildings and you have no clue where to look for or what their purpose was."
45,5.0,What a privilege to tour Gyeongbokgung Palace. You see many women and men visiting wearing traditional garments to compliment the scene. I arrived right in time to whiteness changing of the guards. This was my first time to South Korea so especially for first time visitors I’d highly recommend.
46,4.0,I would go on a weekend so you can see everyone wearing beautiful traditional clothing. There isn't much to do when you get there but its nice to walk around just take a few hours to yourself.
47,2.0,"Since the japanese destroyed all,it was rebuild.Notting much left inside but fancy woodwork.frankly i wasnt impressed much!If you skip it you wont miss much"
48,5.0,The first palace . Burn down during war. The best thing is the guard change process in the morning 9.30 . U can see the actual history . If u wear the traditional Korean dress the entry ticket is free.
49,4.0,"A short visit to this place. I went to this place with the Korean traditional cloth - Hanbok. We rent the cloth nearby this place. When we visited Gyeongbokgung, the place is big and quiet crowded because it was the first week of spring and the students got two free-day. Well we didn't really get complete information about this place because our short time and we preferred to make some photos."
50,5.0,"I think a visit to Seoul for any first timer is not complete without a stopover to this Grand Palace located in the heard of Seoul. A grand palace it is indeed! The grounds were well kept, and the landscaping made it so serene and calm (apart from the busy groups of tourists taking selfies in their beautiful rented hanboks)The changing of the guards is a must see too!"
51,4.0,"The Palace is beautiful.  Our tour guide, with quite a sense of humor, did a great job explaining the history and present-day status of the palace.  There as a medium-sized crowd overall, and good thing we had our jackets!  It was cold!!  The palace is worth visiting!  Truly iconic!  If you have limited time, be sure to add this to your tour list!  Lots of nearby restaurants too.  The mountain scenery is breathtaking!"
52,4.0,"Huge and Massive. The two words that you can describe about this Palace. Full of many tourist who wearing old traditional costume of South Korea and walking as well taking picture in many corner of this palace. A must see place that you should visit when in Seoul. Very simple to find and walking distance to some hotels, other tourist area and main attraction."
53,4.0,"Firstly, this is one place to catch the glance, understand the culture. Most cetainly, this is a must for vising Corea/Seoul."
54,3.0,"The place is very BIG and clean, but historical naration to the tourist is not sufficient. Only some area has a naration."
55,4.0,Just as we arrived they performed the changing of the guard which was very impressive.  The grounds are beautiful and it is relaxing if you just want to sit on a bench and enjoy the scenery.
56,5.0,Our tour guide Harry shared the every detail of the historical background of this palace. The architectural structure is truly amazing because every detail has its own meaning.
57,5.0,"One of the top Seoul attractions. Very vast, a lot to learn about Seoul history. Prepare to walk a lot inside."
58,4.0,"Enjoy the palace on snowy days, I think it is more beautiful that way. Atleast what my family & I did! Only 4- because there is not much to see. When you are inside there may be a second museum which holds different event for different seasons. There you have to pay aswell, nothing is free in this world my sons."
59,3.0,"It's an interesting place but although the site is ancient, the current remains are not so old. Going in the winter does not show it off as best as it could be."
60,5.0,"Buy the combination ticket if you plan to visit the various palaces around Seoul. It will save you a few WON. Just be mindful of which dates the different locations are closed (some on Monday and some Tuesday). The site itself is lovely to walk, and you'll see dozens of young people dressed in traditional hanbok dresses and suits wandering around taking selfies."
61,4.0,A nice contrast to normal life in Seoul.. a must see if you are a true traveller.. very beautiful kept and a fantastic view info korean history...
62,4.0,I went here as part of a business conference.  The architecture and history were very interesting.  The palace and grounds are beautiful. A good way to understand a little more about the history of Korea.
63,5.0,This is a must when you visit South Korea!!  Be sure to catch the shows offered at 10 AM and 2 PM — gives great insight to the Korean culture.  Traditional Korean attire is available for rental at nearby shops — feel free to rent one for the full experience.
64,4.0,"It is a crowded tourist place. Nice to see the guard changing ceremony. Visitor is allowed only to see the outside of the buildings inside the palace. not all of the buildings are accessible, the huge lands are only accessible for certain parts only. The most disappointing aspect is that this palace was destroyed so many times and the buildings seen today is recent. And not 1000 +++ old."
65,4.0,Imagine having to walk the same paths within the palace walls as the kings of Goryeo ... Joseon Dynasty.
66,5.0,If you want to know more about Korea as a first visitor you must see this palace to understand more about the incredibly rich culture of South Korea
67,5.0,"Enjoyed walking around the various palace sites, although it was really crowded with many people (both locals and foreigners) wearing hanboks and taking photos around the palace. The area with the pond area was especially pretty!"
68,3.0,"The place is nice but it looks always the same, from the entrance to the center and surrounding . A small concert was on, and many girls were wearing typical korean old time dress, nice to see and to listen at . My young guide, a 15 yo volontaire , have been very kind . Very interesting to know that the floor heating have not been invented recently and probably not in Europe, ... no idea ."
69,4.0,"Very interesting to walk around with a guide to learn about the history. Architecture and designs are nice but because this was rebuilt, it doesn't have a high level of fascination (it's basically a replica).Quickly make your way to the Museum to learn some interesting things."
70,5.0,I like to visit this place again to get a good feel of the Korean culture. A must see to visit and experience.
71,4.0,Great piece of history in a modern city! Many locals visit in traditional dress and interesting to  see the changing of the guards.
72,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is reminiscent of Central Park in that it is situated in the middle of an enormous, loud city but allows for a level of peace and solitude that you wouldn't expect to find.  Having been built originally in the 1300s, the palace is a shell of it;'s original self having been destroyed by the Japanese hundreds of years later.  That being said, the majority of the building have likely been rebuilt but their beauty and attention to detail are remarkable.  A must see while in Seoul."
73,4.0,This ia must see as it contains lots of history and beautiful Korean architecture.  You will need to spend minimum half a day here to even just do most of the area.  Longer if you want to go into the details.
74,5.0,Wonderful opportunity to experience a piece of history in the heart of Seoul! Very popular destination. Be prepared to stay for a few hours to really enjoy the amazing architecture and nature that grace the area. Also check for current opening and closing times before you head out.
75,5.0,Beautifully restored palaces in the Center of Seoul. Defiantly worth the trip and the about 3$ of entrance fee.
76,4.0,"We were actually told by our hotel that the palace (and all the other palaces in Seoul) close on Mondays but we happened upon it on our walk around Seoul in search of the Hyundai Art Gallery. As it turned out the gallery was closed but the palace was open so we were able to walk in to the imposing forecourt and surrounds. The setting is wonderful overlooked on the one side by a towering mountain and on the other by a range of imposing city skyscrapers. The 13th century palace has been built and rebuilt and destroyed several times over the centuries, the most recent renovation only a couple of decades back. There's enough there to give a sense of days gone by and former splendour."
77,5.0,Visited the royal palace on a Sunday.  Lots of people about taking in the beautiful weather with clear blue skies.  It was fantastic to see many young Koreans in traditional dress at the palace.   I was by myself so took my time in looking around
78,4.0,"Took a tour on a hot day. It was ok.Rented a aoudio guide. It did the job. Easy to go around with. The place is beautiful , building and gardens. There sevral cultural shows during the day."
79,4.0,"There are several palaces in Seoul opened to the public. Gyeongbokgung is perhaps one of the more popular. Comparatively it does have more interesting structure. Of all the palaces I visit, Gyeongbokgung has activities that bring Korean culture closer to the visitors. Overall definitely one of the palace you should visit if palaces is on your agenda."
80,5.0,"I decided to immerse myself in at least one major attraction (ended up with three), and this was the crown jewel.  Not only were the buildings beautiful and fascinating, but on the day I visited, there were parades and demonstrations by costumed employees.  It is hard to fathom the life the Koreans have been under, given near-continuous wars and occupations, but this palace does give the visitor a feeling of the grandeur of the country at peace.  I would recommend this, as well as the neighboring museums, for a deep appreciation of the people, their politeness and hospitality, despite many years of turmoil."
81,5.0,"Even if you have only very limited time, this is a must see. Very impressive and built to last. Takes 1-2 hours."
82,3.0,"Downtown. It's seem have to visit this place before you visiting another place tourism. No wifi,  Clean,  clear signage, family."
83,4.0,"The palace gave an idea of life several 100 years ago. The pavilion in the centre of a lake was most attactive and, on the day I was there, was the background for wedding photos. We saw the colourful changing of the guard."
84,5.0,"It is large palace with different  buildings and big  park. You can spend hours here  and you won't be bored, you will be relaxed. After 10.00 starts big noise with incoming groups. I don't know whether It was because of election or it was  usual."
85,3.0,"Was there to visit the palace in Apr 2017. Location is central u can take a subway to the station named after it and a short walk will take u to main gate. It happened to be I think royal culture week so many Koreans dressed in traditional hangbok so it was quite a sight. Entrance fee is not expensive only around 1500 won I think. I rented a audio guide in English but on hindsight I would suggest to take the free English guided tour at specific intervals daily. As the audio guide was cumbersome to use and info was a bit of overkill. But it gives some background on the palace which was central piece of Korean culture. The place was definitely much smaller than Beijing forbidden city which I feel is a much better tourist experience. Probably because most of buildings were burnt down during jap occupation and the rebuilt ones had spartan deco within. And there wasn't much exhibition on ancient palace exhibits unlike the forbidden city. Hence my average rating. But if u haven't been to china, I guess it's still a good way to spend 2-3 hours of your time understanding the Korean history and the royal family."
86,4.0,"When I visited there was a rehearsal going on for a concert.  It very enjoyable.  I enjoyed the sense of calm, beauty and history of the palace."
87,5.0,It is a very beautiful place which definity needs a visit. It gives you a taste of the local culture and is definitely highly recommended
88,5.0,"I would like to recommend this place to foreigners who visit to Korea.You can learn Korea history and tradition!Also, can feel Korean life style.You can get to there by subway No.3 (Orange line)."
89,5.0,"Korea Grand Palace ""Kyoung Bok Gung""Great place to learn Korea history and tradition.You can get there by subway No.3 (Orange line).I've been to Old Palace in other countries, because, can know their history and tradition.Also, this place is same.Really different architecture and life style.I would like to recommend this place to foreigners who visit to Korea."
90,5.0,"Korea's last dynasty's palace(Joseon Dynasty). If you are a foreigner or first time visiting abroad born korean, you must visit this palace. Use a guided tour. You will learn and understand the construction and the design. Don't forget to visit the museum. You will see the Korea's then and now."
91,5.0,What a great place to visit and see! Totally loved our tour of this site. A lot of cool history and a lot to see!
92,5.0,"It is very near to Insadonf, Buchon. Walked non stop with rented Hanbok that gave free admission to a lot of UNESCO Sites. Inviting and great royal feel in  the architecture and cleverly constructed engineering around us."
93,5.0,"Every time I've been to Seoul on business trip, I go to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace with different people from my countries. We usually have no tourist guide and our people are not good at English as well as Korean so I have to introduce them about this palace by myself. The more I visit this palace, the more I feel how great it is. Even it was burnt down once but Korean people rebuilt and re-act all the activity so people can understand what happened there several hundred years ago. It's also very good place to take a walk then you can enjoy very nice food so called Samgyetang at a very famous restaurant nearby.It's really nice place for visiting at any time of the year."
94,3.0,"Nice palace.  Well maintained attraction.  Very inexpensive to get in.  The grounds are large, so on a nice day, this is a very nice walk.  Would've been nice to see on of the buildings furnished as it would've looked during the period.  So after looking at many buildings, we got kinda bored."
95,4.0,"either stroll around or, what I prefer, just sit and take in the scenery, let you thoughts do the walking and relax in the middle of a busy city"
96,5.0,You can't skip coming to see the Palace if you visit Seoul. History at your fingertips. highly recommended
97,5.0,"Our visit here started with watching the changing of the gaurds ceremony at 10AM. We weere lucky to watch it as it was quite freezing weather and at some point , in severe weather the ceremony is cancelled. The palace itself is a complex of beautiful palaces demonstaring the maginifecnt architecture and are a must-see whie in Seoul."
98,5.0,The history of Seoul is so unique and the people are extremely friendly.  Very safe area.  Lots of ex pats in down town.
99,5.0,"Truly beautiful.  Bit of a hike to get around and see everything there, but on a nice pleasant Seoul day well worth the extra steps. Interesting architecture and would recommend taking the time to just take a step back and take it in.  A guide would be somewhat helpful, but a good tour guide book can be nearly as accommodating."
100,4.0,"Impressive palace, big place. I also visited the folk museum next door which was not all the interesing. It was Sunday and many women walked around in traditional folk costumes, a real sight."
101,4.0,"Did a solo trip to the palace, which is conveniently located near a subway station.There is a change of traditional palace guard parade that had explanations in English, Mandarin and Japanese; very interesting to watch and understand.The palace itself is quite a big compound and well preserved and restored. I would have preferred that there were more directional signages and explanations of the various locations of the palace. I did not see any maps for visitors to take along (maybe I missed it), hence, some places that I walked had nothing much to view. The lack of explanation boards at the various locations made my visit a purely sightseeing trip, so for those who want some history, either get a guide book or a guided tour."
102,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung palace is the largest palace in Seoul. Within its compound, you would find other museums too. There are guard changing ceremonies and English guided tours at various timings of the day. It would be wise to plan in advance. Do note that it's closed on Tuesdays. If you are planning to visit the secret garden at Changdeokgung Palace, you would be better off getting the combi ticket at 10,000 won and this valid for 1 month.If you are visiting in January, make sure you have sufficient winter clothings as the palace tours can get fairly chilly at times. Also, make sure you have a good breakfast too as you are likely to spend more than half a day here."
103,5.0,This the the biggest and most tourists will go if they only pick one palace in Seoul.Better to join the guided tour to understand more.
104,5.0,The narratives in the palace give you an idea of history of conflict between Japan and Korea .... in particular Japan's aggression.
105,4.0,"Excellent site.   It only cost about 6 dollars to enter the palace grounds. I was surprised how large the attraction was.  We only had a couple of hours to tour the palace, so we had to rush through it.  It includes a museum that has a lot of history to cover. Access is easy either via cab or metro.  We use  a cab and it was inexpensive."
106,5.0,Visited the palace with the free shuttle from Hotel Ibis.The palace is grand and huge. It was rebuild and it is still in the process of rebuilding as it was destroy during the war. I took the free guided tour and it gives us a good history lesson.A good place to visit for at least 4 hours and there is also the changing of guards that you should not miss. A must visit place while you are in Seoul.
107,4.0,"I visited three palaces during my visit and enjoyed this one the most. It is a huge complex and takes time.  The Changing of the Guard is a must see--I think they do it at 11 and 2 pm--but check before making plans.   If you have been to the large palaces in China, this will seem familiar but still worth it.  Cost is only 3000 won--so under $3 US."
108,5.0,"You're dazzled the moment you step into the main gates from the street.Locals dressed in the local dress add a priceless touch to the place.The blend of the old architecture with the modern cityscape in the background is something not to miss.It is quite a long walk to the palace itself, but well worth it. A lot of greenery and running waters add a peaceful touch to the place.Be ready to get a lot of photos and don't worry about the food or drink as there are small stalls with snacks and drinks spread throughout the place.Usually, musical shows and concerts are held there at around 7 pm with separate tickets but the settings are usually bewildering.If you get the chance to go, don't think twice."
109,4.0,"The Museum is a must see attraction if you are visiting Seoul, South Korea. The Museum is one of the oldest palaces that remains in the country."
110,5.0,This is not that palace that comes to your mind when you think of any palace. This is a wide spread area with center located prayer hall and small rooms around the area. Entrace and buildings inside are of typical Korean construction in their early stages. You may feel relaxed as if you were in Korea before 70 to 100 years
111,3.0,"This is interesting, but nothing too out of the ordinary.  The changing of the guard was the highlight of the visit."
112,5.0,Beautiful traditional palace in the nature. The tickets are reasonable and there is a free guide that takes you all around telling you abouy history.
113,5.0,A must visit place. Subway station is connected to the monument. Follow the directions and markings in the subway station. Last entry in the Palace is 1600 HRS. Try to be there before 3:00 PM.  The Museum next to Palace is free. Museum is open until 6 pm. There is a good souvenir shop in the basement of the museum.
114,5.0,I learned a lot about architecture from visiting this palace.  Also a lot about Korean history.  It is well worth a visit.
115,5.0,One of the largest and oldest palaces in the region. Nice architecture. Very well maintained. Beautiful symmetry to the place.
116,5.0,A fantastic walk through history with some great photo opportunities.  Lots of atmosphere.  Much better on a sunny day.
117,4.0,"Very nice park, rather large. Relaxing place for a walk. Some beautiful buildings. Shows a glimp of how korea used to be. Very touristic."
118,4.0,The palace is closed on Tuesday though. It's crowded inside. We managed to take better photos from the National Museum outside.
119,4.0,"Good attraction, large palace, different structures, Korean heritage. Went on a day when there was a cultural festival going on. Lot of youngsters wearing traditional and colourful dresses"
120,4.0,"This park had many interesting buildings and highlights.  At only $1, it was worth it to walk through and look around.  I wish there was more information about it that we could have read.  Perhaps we should have rented the headphones."
121,5.0,"We chose to visit Gyeongbok Palace over other palaces due to time constraint and it was a very worthwhile visit. We were marveled at the architecture in a very distinct Korean way and the detailed danchung painting of the roof overhang. In addition, Goenghoeru Pavillion in the pond was an outstanding idea to have a royal reception or celebration among noble people. Walking northbound, we were able to see a part of neighboring Chungwadae which is the residence  of the Korean President in the backdrop of a mountain and it was absolutely beautiful. For the entertainment, there are changing guard procedure and military drill as the King watching. This can't be compared to the changing guard performance of Buckingnam Palace in London in quality, but it adds to understanding of the Joseon Dynasty. I highly recommend to visit the palace and the surrounding area. One can finish touring in as little as 1 hour or all day long."
122,4.0,"Well worth a visit, mainly for the notable scale and architecture.  The terrain, buildings and gardens are all impressive.  The textual descriptions are spare, but there are free tours.  Personally, I though the highlight was just seeing the buildings themselves.  You can rent ""hanbok"" nearby and walk around in costume for an extra treat."
123,3.0,A half day well spent surrounded by friendly and smiling local visitors. Monuments descriptions could be more detailed though if you have any interest in the actual historical facts
124,5.0,we only spend a short time to see a couple of palaces and this one had a nice changing of the guards
125,4.0,its was really interesting to see the Gyeongbokkgung Place. Whit the Metro its just to easy to find it.
126,4.0,This is one of half-a-dozen Palaces and holy places you need to visit in Seoul. You can buy a serial ticket to five attractions for 10000 Korean wons. It is truly amazing to see how these old buildings fit in with the otherwise so modernized city.
127,4.0,We had a private guided tour and this of course was extremely helpful. It is a large complex with a  museum - good written explanation as you go with some interactive displays. Very informative and interesting for a European with little knowledge of Korea and its history.
128,5.0,"I was taken here as part of an organised business tour. The palace is well worth a visit, covering extensive grounds. We arrived in time to see the staged changing of the guard, which was a great spectacle. I most enjoyed the lake and gardens."
129,4.0,"The grounds here are beautiful and the structures are as well. The insides, the ceilings particularly are very intricate and colorful but nothing is original because 90% of it was torn down during Japanese occupation which is a shame. The restoration and rebuilding of the structures is very nice, so it is nice to imagine how it would have looked. There are also plaques all around that explain the buildings and it is worth looking up online before you go, but I wouldn't pay for a tour. I was teaching in Seoul and took my family (who was visiting) here in July of 2015 and they enjoyed it but once you have seen one palace in Korea you have seen them all. Doing the hop-on-hop-off bus tour is your best bet! Then you can spend as much time as you would like and move on."
130,5.0,Who knew that the Korean dynasty was so old or that the 4th king created to Korean language or that it died out because the 27th king was infertile?
131,4.0,"You can spend 1 hour or half a day here. It's really up to you.  It is very large and on the premise are also the Palace Museum and the National Folk Museum.  The palace is beautiful.  There are a lot of people wearing the traditional Korean clothes around and it is really nice.  At two o'clock, there is a ""guards changing"" ceremony.  If you happen to be there, I recommend it, but if you miss it, I don't think you should be sad.  The two story structure shown requires Internet reservation a day in advance, so I was kind of bummed that I did not get to go in.  I just walked around and took my time and worked up a good appetite for the yummy Korean food I had later."
132,5.0,"This is one of the Seoul ""Top 10"" attractions, but the reviews on Trip Advisor are not unanimously good - so I went wondering if it would be enjoyable, or a bit of a let-down. Well I'm pleased to be able to report that I thoroughly enjoyed it. I had a good walk around Gyeongbokgung Palace and also popped in to the Korean Museum of Folk Culture next door.I found the Palace very interesting and rather impressive (I did not do a guided tour, I just walked round by myself). Entry is 3000 Won (around US$3, GBP£2) which is absolutely excellent value for money. There were quite a lot of locals there in traditional and very colorful dress, which really brightened the experience.It took me 2 hours to have a really good look around and take my photos. The Folk Museum I mentioned earlier I do not recommend. I spent just 5-10 minutes in there and it will certainly be of much more interest to Koreans than to visitors. Nevertheless, entry was free so I'm not complaining... just advising!I notice more than one review comparing Gyeongbokgung Palace with the Forbidden City in Beijing. Gyeongbokgung Palace is much smaller (although still occupying quite a large area) but quite similar in its layout and appearance. Please don't go to Gyeongbokgung Palace hoping or expecting to find an equal of the Forbidden City, but I think you will find something equally as interesting although rather less dramatic in scale.The day I visited the weather was sunny. I would not advise going on a rainy day, I think that would totally spoil your visit.Overall, very highly recommended."
133,5.0,Very grand and full of history. The palace grounds are well maintained and the architecture preserved. Weather was great and we had a good stroll and introduction to the grounds!
134,5.0,"I visited this palace many times,still I feel good hereIt has long history of  Joseon dynasty. Plus you can see many people in hanbok,which makes the palace more special. I recommend to visit Gyeongbok palace."
135,4.0,"Great for a morning walk, especially in the gardens. Read up on the history a little before you go to get context. Also try to see the changing of the guards."
136,5.0,It's very cheap to access and very quiet and reflective. I liken it to a smaller version of The Forbidden City.
137,4.0,It is very accessible from our hotel since it was a few blocks away. And we were able to have a quick tour of the palace in between our business meetings. At least plan half of your day when going here. Because the palace is very wide. You will appreciate the beauty of their structures and also their garden. You will be lucky to have a photograp with gilrs wearing their traditional dress costume without a cost. And also before going inside avoid touching the palace guards because it is prohibited.
138,5.0,"Accessible, with tourists even the cold season, it helps you realize the history of Seoul and South Korea."
139,4.0,"I visited the palace once in 2015 during day and once in July 2016 at night. I have to say, the first time I saw the architecture of the buildings I was impressed. The second time around was not as impressive. I would recommend the palace to first time visitors to get a better feel for Korean style buildings. If I go back to Korea, the palace will not be on my list to do."
140,4.0,"This is an ancient palace in the middle of  very modern city. The site has been restored quite heavily but remains very interesting. there are two museums on site, we visited one of them the museum of Korean Life. A great little museum."
141,5.0,"This is a must-see if you go to Seoul, especially to understand something of Korea's cultural history. The palace is actually a huge complex of buildings square in the midst of downtown Seoul's business district, so it's accessible by car, bus, or metro. Parking is at a premium,however, so use public transport if at all possible. Be advised that this tour requires lots of walking due to the size of the complex, numerous buildings & gardens, etc. If you're there in summer, except it to be HOT, so be prepared. An umbrella is a good idea, both in case of rain & for shade if it doesn't rain. The buildings are serene & beautiful outside & surprisingly plain inside. On our visit there were numerous Koea-American, Koean-Canadian,& Korean-Australian young women there in full traditional dress, which is beautiful & adds to the charm of the place. It's kind of a pilgrimage for them, apparently. Don't miss the excellent museum adjacent to the complex. Nice & cool in there, & the exhibits are interesting & help you understand what you're seeing outside. (I suggest doing the museum first, then the complex.) The restaurant adjacent to the museum offers a limited Korean cuisine. If that doesn't appeal to you, there are numerous food outlets in the near downtown area, but that will involve more walking. You should allow at least 3 hours to tour the museum & palace complex, more if you intend to stop for a meal. But this is a great place to visit, highly recommended."
142,5.0,i had the opportunity to go on a night tour of this palace with a Korean friend and i can highly recommend it. the lighting of the structures and the overall atmosphere was something special.
143,5.0,We got a chance to visit the Korean palace. Plan on staying at least 2 hours. It is one of the best places in the city to take your family and to take pictures. It is pretty inspiring. We were lucky to have a guide explain the whole place.  It is well worth the investment.
144,5.0,If you visit Seoul then you must visit this palace! It is a very vast assortment of old buildings and gardens so be prepared for a hike! Some of the visitors are as interesting as the buildings! The juxtaposition of old against modern is striking.
145,5.0,"Excellent palace, worth the 3000 Won ticket. I visited this on Saturday and many young Koreans were dressed in the national customs and happy to have their photos taken. The gardens also good to visit and good photography opportunities of Seoul skyline."
146,5.0,This beautiful palace was a beautiful trip through history  The English speaking tour guide was great.  We learned a lot and enjoyed our experience.
147,5.0,"Good architecture of past korean building, there is free guide for every hour that will explained the for every building in this palace, in english."
148,5.0,"It is really amazing place. Very cheap too (only 3.000 won and you get a free tour of 1:30h). The place is huge so wear confortable clothes and shoes. If you are coming in a sunny day do not forget to wear sunscreen and caps because except for the gardens, there are not much shadow or trees to hide from the sun. You will probably spend more than 2 hours walking. You can also rent an audio tour if you do not want to wait for the next free tour. Beautiful buildings and story of Joseun Dinasty."
149,5.0,"This tour is absolutely nice !!! We loved everything, especially the greated tour options. Thanks for all of your good suggestions. I also appreciate your guiding me as I really appreciate Seoul and Korean culture so much now! Thank you for everything."
150,5.0,"We are in Seoul for a conference but whenever we travel we love to do museums/palaces/temples. This was wonderful - calm, beautiful, historic. It seemingly goes on forever but definitely as a respite in the chaos of city life in Seoul!"
151,5.0,"is is excellent that middle in a modern city, suddenly you reach a part of tradition in best condition . when ever you have a travel to Seoul, donot miss this place"
152,5.0,It's big so be ready to walk.  You can tell the palace was renovated...probably due to the war.  But still very beautiful and serene. It's a MUST SEE if you're in Seoul!
153,5.0,"As seen in the korean movies: nice place to visit, to see korean culture and tradition. A lot of korean pines around."
154,5.0,You can't go to Seoul without taking in the historic atmosphere with relaxed strolls around Seoul's Palaces!
155,5.0,"Just check the time of free guided tours and guard changing ceremonies before you reach the palace. With the guided tour it was quite lovely. View is nice, the palaces are similar to Chinese architecture but a bit different as they are based on Confucius' teachings."
156,4.0,The Koreans have worked hard to rebuild this culturally significant complex of buildings after the destruction of the 20th Century.  Its a kind of forbidden city on a smaller scale.
157,5.0,"They are not really set up for tourism just yet, but if you are visiting South Korea, make the effort to visit ALL the cultural sites; you will be gob-struck at the history. Just stunning!"
158,4.0,Make sure you wear comfortable shoes when you will visit this palace. Its really wide spread and you will need to walk quiet a bit to see everything. Please keep at least a few hours in hand to see everything. There are a few guided tours available that you tickets for.
159,4.0,"If you are someone who loves history, this place is worth visiting. Otherwise, going there is also worth the trip if you are looking for places to take pictures with buildings on the yesteryears."
160,4.0,"A very good place to spend a weekend morning, looking the beautiful palaces and gardens, with good oportunities to take a lot of beautiful shots.."
161,4.0,ensuring the traditional palace is maintained is good that too in the middle of the city.  At one end you see the palace and the opposite side you see all the modern sky scrapers.  good visit
162,5.0,It was fantastic to visit this palace. It is made out of wood mostly and amazing how it is not damaged after 100s of years. We did not go inside the main part which needs ticket but we're able to see a lot in free ticket zone.
163,4.0,It was pretty much a muchnes although changing of the guard really good. Inside was sparse and for me just ok.  The museum however far more interesting as it depicted life to the present
164,4.0,I recommend to visit this place which is very interesting for you to discover South Korean history. Enjoy it.
165,5.0,This is a must see if you are in Seoul. The building is not accessible to the public on most days and is used for official functions.  It is a beautiful example of traditional Korean architecture and stunningly beautiful. I was very impressed.
166,5.0,"A must see. It is better to go with the tour. They have a microphone so easy to listen to. They have tour in Korean, English and in Japanese."
167,5.0,"Although largely reconstructed after the second world war, Gyeongbokgung Palace is an impressive example of Korean classical architecture. Must-see for any Seoul visitor with a few hours to spare."
168,4.0,"So excited visit this place,bcoz im wearing Hanbok (traditional costume of korea) so it looks special when you taking picture wif hanbok infront of the  Gyeongbokgung Palace"
169,4.0,"Entering the compound, like taking a time machine back to the ancient time of Korea, where the emperor still have the Vito power. It also feels like entering a scene in the korean drama. See how the king lived, the life in a grade palace. At the same time, we can feel that no matter how great a king was, finally it back to the earth, ash to ash, soil to soil. Then the democracy hit, slowly Seoul becomes the Seoul today, modern, fast pace, developed. It worth to take a walk to this historical place, but suggestd to do it during spring or autumn, particularly the festival of cherry blossom."
170,5.0,This is a beautiful palace -- the largest of the major palaces. The grounds were lovely. Great photo ops!
171,5.0,"If you are in Seoul, that's the Nr. 1 not to be missed part of the city. Fanastic experience, felt myself in the ancient time. Perfect if you are on business trip and just have a few hours till your transfer to the airport. Main entrance is recommended to use for entry - but for exit, it is much more better to use the side one which takes you to the Bukchon Hanok Village which has been a traditional residential area for 600 years. Full of traditional and modern small houses, cafes, shops, unforgettable epxerience walking on the small streets of it!"
172,4.0,"Spacious palace, cold weather, windy.. That what i feel when i visited this palace. Surrounded by mountains... It so beautiful place to see. An ancient building with the history it self. Make this palace is one of must visit place in seoul."
173,4.0,I like this place. You can visit the museum first. It tells history of korea. Then visit the traditional palace and you can watch the traditional parade (i dont know the name)The location is nearby the blue house.
174,4.0,"This place is huge, and in a cool area that's easy to get to by the Seoul Metro.  Very historic and lots to do in the area when you are finished here.  I would definitely go here if your in Seoul."
175,5.0,"Visited in March, 2016.  My only complaint, the water in the ponds were drained for the winter.  Still a very impressive place to visit."
176,4.0,The Palace and the Museum is a good place to get to see the Ancient Korean Architecture but we must go along with a Guide else we might not understand anything....  Disappointing that entry into any of the Halls are restricted and Tourists can only see the Architecture from the Outside.
177,4.0,"Nice view of the Palace from the hotel . So big to visit, and is a land mark for history lovers and Asian Architect seekers. See pictures ."
178,5.0,"Close to the fantastics National Museum (free), while you need to pay a small fee to enter in main complex of Gyeongbokgung (worth the $). Plenty of people wearing traditional dresses, a traditional show, very nice palace, plenty of old style buildings, and even is possible to see a show with Korean guard, old style. Awesome. Just don't try the food on the national museum and go somewhere else for lunch, really bad. Easy to get ther by metro, has got a station 2 minutes from entrance of the palace and the natinal museum. Good choice to spend the whole morning."
179,5.0,"and amazing value for money. If you just have a couple of hours to spend in Seoul, this is a great option."
180,5.0,"Very similar to the Forbidden City in Beijing, this site contains a complex of courtyards and different buildings, lakes and places where you can walk."
181,5.0,"Insight of Korean history, way of living... Definitely take a guide, they will explain a lot of interesting details about this ""forbidden city of Korea"""
182,5.0,"One can walk around and see the grounds, but the guided tour turns it into an experience. One hour to walk through the palace grounds plus 90 minutes to experience the hidden garden. Spring and fall must be stunning. I went in February when landscape was dormant. Still with the time even though it was chilly out. Dress warm."
183,5.0,"I went there first thing in the morning and to my surprise, was a tour in Japanese. So, I joined them, although I had no clue what the guide was talking about. But a couple of Japanese tourists, after realizing I speak no Japanese, they were so nice and translated me lots of things the guide was telling them.Plus, I had a nice brochure with English text that was very useful.Lots of things to see there. From beautiful old buildings and amazing decorations to beautiful landscaped and spacious gardens. Highly recommended."
184,4.0,"Great couple of hours, some good photo opportunities especially the guards on the gates. Close to main centre of town"
185,5.0,"Gyeongbok Palace is a historical palace that been used for King in the past time.  This palace is very big and consist so many building.  Here we can see the Place for held a party, meeting, room for King & Queen and also rooms for King's Concubine.  Here we can see so many important building."
186,4.0,"It was my first time in Korea, I love everything I've seen. Hopefully, I will have a chance to be there again."
187,5.0,Just a short walk from the Gyeongbokgung subway stop on the #3 line. Take exit door 5. You can spend a day touring the palace grounds and enjoying the museum. Seniors can enter without paying a fee.
188,5.0,"I went here because it was #1 on TripAdvisor's list for Seoul. I managed to arrive just as an English language tour was starting. The guide was knowledgeable and pleasant but she didn't really encourage questions. Of course it was cold and windy outside so that may have affected everyone. The tour and the overall exhibit are all outside so the weather on a particular day may affect your appreciation.I felt that I learned a lot of Korean history, especially the story of the invention of the Korean alphabet. Well done!"
189,5.0,I love the Changing Guard Ceremony.Very lovely place and tour guides really hard to provide best services.  Love it!!
190,5.0,I was surprised to see that the palace was open for visitors at night. all the buildings were illuminated. I had a very good opportunity for very good night shots of this magnificent place.
191,3.0,A place definitely worth a visit if you are in Seoul. It is however a pity that you as a tourist are not allowed to enter any of the buildings.
192,5.0,Like the every bit of the view and the palace. What a technology and I liked the way solders shifted their timing.
193,3.0,"Visited on a rainy day so maybe that is part of the disappointment.Other than change of the guard did not see anything too exciting other than the main area.Very little offered in English so had difficulty understanding the context.I you have to choose one, go for the Changdeokgung Palace instead."
194,5.0,"This was a palace in the era of Joseon Dynasty which is well maintained. There are two lakes with gazebos: Kyunghoilu and Hyangwonjeong. These two lakes are very beautiful. From time to time, this place is open to the public at night times and you should book at the designated dates if you want to see it. Especially, the night views of these two lakes are the most beautiful. Many photographers gather to take pictures of them."
195,5.0,Although it is rebuilt from the ruins the Japanese invasion left it is an impressive insight in the historic king's palace and with a 1 hour tour in english you get all the essential information.
196,5.0,"unbelievable what has been built centuries ago, and is still in such a good shape. I believe there is a lot of energy spent on keeping it in good shape, but it makes you feel how it has felt in Korea in the 13th century"
197,5.0,The Palace is a lovely place to spend an hour of 4 with nice buildings and a lovely Garden. On site is also the Korean Folk Museum.
198,5.0,We had a tour guide to show us apround but just going by yourself would be fine too. It was very busy with kindergarten kids everywhere but I think it would have been so busy other than that.
199,4.0,This is one of those place you have to visit while in Seoul to get a glimpse of days of yore. It can get packed with tour groups so quite difficult to get clean shots without photo bombers. Check out the changing of the guards and have your photos taken with them.
200,5.0,Very interesting trip. enjoyed the tour. Invest in the audio unless you are on a tour with a guide. Was interesting to learn some of the history of Korea.
201,5.0,"I was fortunate to tour the palace with a local Korean business man.  Not only was I able to view the palace using the interactive guide, I also was able to get commentary from the local Korean business contact.  It was a gorgeous day and the trees were turning in the fall.  The Hyangwonjeong and Geoncheonggung were highlights of the tour.This is a must see when in Seoul.  A far better tour and more elaborate place than the forbidden city in Beijing, but also shows the cultural differences."
202,5.0,"A huge sprawling complex, recreating the richness of the centuries of Korean royalty. Best with a guide as it is massive and busy! Loved it. Make sure you see the stationing of the guard gates. Terrific."
203,4.0,"It is one of the top ten tourist destination in Seoul so  don't miss it if you are here for the first time. It is big place and offer free museum entry, although you will need to pay 3000 won to get to see inside the palace but it is worth it absolutely.  Very easy access as it is connected to the Gyeongbokgung station, just walkout of the station as it is right in front of you ! Can spend just one hour there to have a quick tour if you are not into too much history !"
204,4.0,Loved all the lovely colours on the buildings. Culturally rich. Good for business travellers on short stay for a 1/2 day outing.
205,4.0,"The palace is set on beautiful grounds, with some water and old trees. The colors of the buildings are beautiful, and you're able to peek inside the buildings. There is a map that tells you about each place."
206,5.0,We took a taxi from our hotel to the palace. IIRC it cost about $30 round trip.  We arrived in time for the changing of the guard ceremony which was nice.  Also took a guided tour.  We enjoyed touring the palace.
207,4.0,"It is a very beautiful palace that you should visit - by all means it has that old historic beauty you will enjoy. Having said that, it is similar to other Asian palaces you may have seen in Japan or China. Yes, the tapestries, paintwork, sculptures will be a little bit different but in the end it is the same or very similar grounds layout and style. I have enjoyed spotting some finer differences between what was in this palace and others I saw in Asia and you can surely spend a couple of hours within its walls to explore more."
208,5.0,The palace was overwhelming but I completeley enjoyed the tour. It was very informative in terms of Korean history.
209,4.0,"A must for anyone's visit to Seoul.  Access to the entire Palace  grounds is provided so that one can experience at their own pace the lifestyle of Korean royalty.  See the conservative nature of the Confucian royalty.  From throne room, to living quarters, to the changing of the guard dressed in traditional Korea military garb, the visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace is a pleasant adventure."
210,5.0,This palace was so beautiful. It is a large property with many different buildings to see. It is a well visited site with many people in attendance each day.  Very interesting place that everyone should see.
211,3.0,"The area of the palace is very large, so it takes a lot of walking to visit everything. I used English audio guide, which told me details of every building and gate, what was it's purpose, when it was destroyed and rebuilt, but I missed general history of the palace. Buildings are very pretty and well preserved, with beautiful paintings on the wooden ceilings and walls. However, they are all very similar to each other. You can't enter them, but you can look through the windows, and they are all almost empty. The best for me were ponds and garden. You can't even get close to the buildings on the ponds, but even from the distance you can tell it's something different. It took me over 2 hours, and it was hot day. If you visit on such a day, don't forget to bring a bottle of water."
212,5.0,"Although its a 1990s reconstruction of the 14th century palace, it is well worth a visit.  Very reminiscent of the Forbidden City in Beijing in a better location with mountain views and surrounding parks"
213,5.0,Importnat and one of the five palaces in Seoul. Very typical structure for Corea and exciting structure.
214,4.0,Amazing photo opportunities with a wealth of history and culture.  Definitely a must see location of South Korea.  Interesting architecture and stories of the past.
215,4.0,"The visit to Gyeongbok Palace was one of the highlights of my trip.  I was able to be there at 10AM for the changing of the guard.  I loved seeing the colorful uniforms and hearing the traditional drum being hit.  Later I was able to sit near the pond where the King used to entertain and throw parties.  The architecture is wonderful, as well.  Lots of walking.  I recommend bringing an umbrella for shade during the summer months."
216,5.0,The biggest palace resides in the heart of Seoul.Entrance fee: about 5 US$. Free guided tour in English - check the information for details. Fabulous building and history
217,5.0,"The biggest and historically most important of the many palaces in Seoul.  Watch a changing of the gate guards and take a guided tour -- much to see and appreciate.  Prepare to cringe a few times if you're Japanese -- the history includes some serious unpleasantness, like the occasion when Japan sent 60 guys to assassinate the empress.  But you'll still enjoy the tour -- I think!  The guides are friendly and knowledgeable.  As an American with almost no knowledge of the Korean language, I certainly liked the tour."
218,5.0,A glimpse of Korea during a different era. Make sure you are there for the changing of the guard ceremony
219,5.0,I was able to visit during a business trip and loved the beauty and history this provided.  I did not get a guided tour which probably only adds to the experience but will loved my visit.
220,4.0,Not a great palace but one of the must see. It represents Korean traditional architecture. When you see other palaces around the world you might say this is not that great but definitely  worth a visit
221,4.0,I love how clean it is remained and how easy to come here. Just take a train and you'll get it here. Do explore outside gyeongbokgung palace for some street food
222,5.0,"Biggest palace I visited in Seoul. Is worth paying the admission tickets and walking through. There is a lot to see. The architecture is amazing, leaning about the culture is fascinating. The changing of the guards is a great show. This place is a must see in Seoul."
223,4.0,The palace is an interesting place to visit to learn about some of Korea's history. Make sure you arrive for the 'changing of the guard' ceremony.
224,5.0,"First visit was done alone and stupidly i covered the first part of the palace and left before exploring the back part of it. It was sooooo amazing to see the lake and different parts of the palace which really brought me to the history of how the palace people lived in the past. Take some time to sit by the lake and absorb the surroundings. You will really feel as if you were brought back into history. Go to the east side of the palace after you end the museum visit. There is a vintage corner which shows a tiny vintage cafe, photo studio and how the commoner lived in the past. Definitely worth that 3000won ticket price and I'm sure it's better with the english language guide to understand the history of the palace."
225,5.0,"I was on a 1 day trip in Seoul, Ms. Guide was very nice and funny, she spoke very good English, so there was no problem to understand everything she said. Probably single trip would be more interesting, than in a group of random ppl, but I didn't have time for organizing everything by myslef. The company picked me-up from the hotel, so I didnt have to worry about anything. Unfortunately I dont remember how was the trip called and via what company. I've ordered it from the hotel.Palace is beautiful, very big, a lot of interesting places with museum, where you can learn something about history. The place is amazing but, like all places in this type, very crowdy, so it's very hard to take a good picture without random ppl."
226,5.0,"The way the emperors lives was pretty cool. Take the walking tour, it is very helpful. Lots of stairs and walking but it is very beautiful, The guards do not move, just like the UK."
227,5.0,"Never fails to be impressed by the architecture and history of the place. Going there on a Saturday means jostling lots of people. Easy to get to the place using the subway. And from the palace there are other attractions nearby, notably the ""Stream""."
228,4.0,"big palace with great architecture... changing guard ceremony, you have to see it........................."
229,4.0,This quite large and well kept palace consists of large wooden ornate buildings in a park like setting. You don't need to go on a tour to visit any of these sort of places. Taxis in Seoul are really inexpensive and will get you to where you want to go for short distances. For longer distances the Metro is fantastic. But I advise you to make good use of Google Maps to get you around the system. But be aware that Maps quotes the stations names in Hangul characters. I ended up with my own special way of recognising parts of the characters!!!The palace is a hot and dry place so ensure that you have water with you. There are some relatively steep sections in parts so if this presents a problem be careful to allow plenty of time.
230,4.0,"Nice palace, and a big site with extensive gardens and a folk museum (think history of Korea), to visit. Only cost a couple of quid, definitely worth it."
231,3.0,Nothing much to see. The guards are unusually dressed in red and blue and are worth a look. The palace is a series of bulidings in a large walled compound with gardens and plenty of gravel.
232,4.0,"A ""must do"" while in Seoul. If you're really into history you could easily spend hours here, but you can also breeze right through and snap a couple pictures. Very affordable."
233,5.0,You should visit during guard change hour. It's quite nice to see the tradition ceremony. The palace is quite big and worth seeing
234,5.0,The palace is located at central Seoul and offers english speaking guide. its easy to go there (metro and taxi).
235,5.0,"We had a guided tour for the morning, if you can get there in time to see the change of guards is a awesome experience. This place is nothing short of amazing. It is VERY big! Take at least 2 hrs to get around it all. Great richness of Korean History. Great value for money."
236,5.0,it was my first impression when I first saw the palace. It is really hige and grand where it needs a huge effort to maintain its condition!
237,4.0,Surrounded by the modern city buildings the Temple is a haven of tradition. Close to the Metro it is easy to get too.The Temple is a traditional Asian style of open spaces and exotically roofed buildings. I do always feel that more could be made of the internals of the buildings. With traditional furniture and features.Well worth a visit when you are in Seoul.
238,5.0,"Fantastic palace; This place is very similar to the forbidden city in Beijing, it goes on and on, with each section opening new insights into the life of its inhabitants. Great architectural detail, and perfect place for some great photos."
239,5.0,This place offers the window of the rich culture of this magnificent country or should I say city. Well preserved historical palaces and noticeably clean environment makes this place a must to visit. The place is located inside the city itself so there will be no problem in getting to this place. There's a large parking space for tourist bus and private cars
240,4.0,"Huge area.. plan on spending at least 2 hours here, if you plan to cover the National Palace Museum and the Folk Museum. Don't miss the changing of guards ceremony."
241,5.0,"wear comfortable shoes and maybe an umbrella if you are there during the summer. I have been here twice, on a fall and just this summer. I would say best time to see this place is during the summer when all the leaves are colorful. The area is situated in the middle of the city but it is pretty magical when you are inside. It's like you are transported to a different era. The place is very well kept. Don't forget to bring your camera!"
242,5.0,"I have visited here twice. It is much better in summer than in winter since in the winter, it is too cold to linger and take in the atmosphere and the historic plaques. It is rather extensive with a lot to see. You can spend a whole day there since on the grounds are the National Folk Museum and the National Palace Museum.  It is also quite close to the Blue House, the residence of the President of South Korea.Down the road in front of the main entrance is the American Embassy and a long promenade where protesters gather."
243,5.0,"A vast collection of ancient Korean buildings, representing the culture of royalty in former days, with countless examples of historical architecture.  Although surrounded by a very active city, once you step inside you feel transported to the way life was several hundred years ago.  Much history can be learned, and at least a half day is needed to do justice to this ancient palace."
244,5.0,Sort of reminded me of the Forbidden City in Beijing on a smaller scale. Looks very vibrant beautiful. I understand that much of it burned at one point & had to be restored. They did a great job!
245,5.0,"The palace is a fantastic place. I understand it was rebuild after the Japanese destroyed the original but it is hard to tell. It looks fairy-tale like in its setting (esp. if you look towards the mountains). In the middle of a busy city, an oasis of tranquility. There are daily performances too.You have to do a lot of walking."
246,4.0,"Little of the original old palace remains, and the ground houses mostly reconstructed buildings and museums, but it's pleasant for a few hours' of walk and exploration nonetheless. Don't expect anything remotely approaching the grandeur of Beijing's Forbidden City, but what it has is well kept and presented.Despite the presence of numerous tour groups, the area is big enough that finding a quiet, scenic spot all to yourself is easy, all just a stone's throw from the bustle of city centre. The cultural park area to the east of site is free of charge and many Seoulites happily spend leisurely time there."
247,5.0,"If you do anything in Seoul, this is it.  You can spend hours at Gyeongbok, and you can blow out your camera in the process.  Recommend you take it slowly and explore all the nooks and crannies."
248,4.0,A very nice and easy tour. Please make sure you have an excellent guide who understands the complete history of the palace. Everyday at 10am the changing of the guards ceremony is a visual treat.
249,4.0,"Had a very nice time here.  The grounds are quite expansive, so put your walking shoes on.  The English self guided walking tour was good.  They didn't give you a lot of information at each site on the headset, so I would say that if you want more, sign up for a tour."
250,4.0,"Great Palace, but tour is enhanced if take the audio guide.  Check out the changing of the guard very interesting. Also Cultural museums on property are very interesting"
251,4.0,"The Palace is well worth a visit. Although the lines for the ticket booth were long, they moved fast. Tickets cost 3000 Won for one museum. There is a nice park on the right hand side of the Palace."
252,5.0,"We visit the palace during the cultural week in Seoul, so there was an interesting exhibition in the front court of the palace of virtual and augmented reality where a traditional book comes to live, it was really nice.  Also the traditional dance made with little robots was really nice.  As part of this cultural festival, there was at night a light and sound free show displayed in the outer wall of the palace.The palace is huge and is worth visiting to get a glimpse of the cultural heritage of Korea."
253,4.0,Very relaxing to wander around and take your time to just look.If you prefer you can go on a guided tour.
254,2.0,You can pass this place. You could check out the guard changing ceremony if you like that kind of stuff.
255,5.0,"I was fortunate to visit the Palace in January, with snow on the ground and on a wonderful clear day.Firstly, there are the guards outside, in traditional uniforms - make sure you see the 'changing of the guard'.Then the palace itself, which has been lovingly restored (having been ford down by the Japanese when they occupied Korea). It is a lovely place just to walk around - and an incredible space within the middle of a modern city.Go to the national museum (adjoining the Palace grounds) after - to get an excellent picture of the history and culture of South Korea."
256,4.0,There is a National Folk Museum inside where you can learn about history and culture about Korea. The Palace architecture is unique.
257,3.0,Good way to spend a couple of hours in Seoul. Guided tours are essential because there is not much in the way of signage or walking maps available to allow you to do a self guided tour.  The complex is sprawling so without a tour guide you will have no idea what you're looking at.  Be prepared for lots of walking. Interesting look inside the Korean imperial court during the Chosin dynasty.
258,5.0,"This is unique place which a must visit place in Seoul. This is a palace spread over a large area where, you can feel the ancient times of Korea. I was there with a Korean friend where we managed to join the free guided tour (as I remember starts at 3:30 pm). If you have any interest on history or like to know some info about this palace, I recommend you to join this free tour where a guide English speaking guide takes the group for guided tour almost for a hour. Most of the things that you learn from this tour cannot be grabed by just walking around in this place.I’m not a big fan of Korean dramas, still I enjoyed this visit. If you are a fan of Korean drams related to historical event, this is a must visit place.Seoul museum is also located in the same premises, so you can visit there also.If you have some sort of an interest on history and have 1-2 hrs to spare, don’t miss this experience. This will give you a memory to recall that you visited Korea.If I happen to visit Seoul again, I will repeat this visit."
259,4.0,"This is the 1st place i visit when i reach Korea. The palace has so many visitors and majority of them are the Koreans. If you ever watched an old Korean drama series and wish to feel how the era looks like, you have to visit this palace. The area are so big, and the buildings are as it should looks like. Great view."
260,4.0,"3000 KRW to spend the whole day. You can op for a tour, or latch yourself with another tour (seen people doing that some time) pack some water and sandwich. It's hard to find food in the palace itself."
261,4.0,If you're in Seoul this is certainly worth a visit. It's amazing to see something so huge right in Central Seoul.I'd recommend a tour - it helps get a real appreciation for the site and it's history. Don't miss the changing of the guard - what a hoot!Some great photo opportunities here with the dramatic hills in the background.
262,4.0,"Our group went on a short trip to this palace, it was very easy to get to from the metro, even for people who don't speak a bit of Korean.  We walked around, enjoyed the palace and gardens.  It is close enough by some shopping as restaurants as well, so it is good place to make a day of sightseeing in Seoul."
263,5.0,Come here early and plan to stay 3-4 hours. There are so many things to see ... some perfect places to take pictures.Make sure you are there for change of the guards.
264,4.0,"Another side trip during a business trip in a cool winter season,,, getting around the place is quite challenging specially if one is not used to this kind of weather, great experience anyway specially seeing the traditional ""changing of the guards"",,,"
265,5.0,Bring your camera and spend a few hours walking around the different buildings and parks.  It can be crowded but worth a visit.
266,5.0,"if u want to feel ancient korea and their historical kingdom , go to this place.i am salute to korea govermenet, preserved this beautiful palace.when i am arrived at this place, there is replacing palace guard.very recomend !!"
267,5.0,"The Gyeongbokgung palace and the museum is well connected to the rest of Seoul using metro and buses and it is around 20 minutes on foot from Chandeokgung palace. This is really beautiful with its architecture, colors, several buildings, mountain backdrop. There is also tours available although I preferred to explore the place on my own."
268,4.0,The whole complex is an interesting view into palace life in old Korea. Most the the building can be entered although not all rooms can be entered. There are tour guides that can provide additional insight. I will say I say this and Changeokgung on the ame day and I am not sure there is that much difference between the two to the untrained eye.
269,5.0,"I think it takes like full day if you want to see every bit of Gyeongbokgung.It tells you once we(Korea) have Dynasty that  a period of peace and prosperity...yes we do have some dark era in that history as well.If you want to know about Korea, it's like the top of the MUST SEE list.Don't miss it."
270,5.0,"The bigger palaces in Korea are definitely worth a visit - this palace has tours, and I would recommend that. Lots of interesting details to learn about the former lives of the royal family. The buildings are gorgeous and very colorful, definitely a highlight from our visit to Seoul."
271,5.0,Really great way to spend an afternoon visiting and learning about the culture.  The temples were really beautiful decorated and entrance into the museum wasnt that much
272,5.0,The palace and grounds are beautiful. It is a historical palace but also quite a relaxing place and escape from the city.
273,3.0,With only a few hours to spare on a brief business trip to Incheon I took the train into Seoul to see the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Yes its all pretty recently been recreated so its not the historical site that some reviewers seem to think it is. I'm sure the restoration is painstakingly authentic too but the fact remains that most of it has been rebuilt over the last 20 years or so.Having said that it's quite a pleasant place to wander around for an hour or two but there's little context in which to place the buildings for the casual tourist and the architecture of one building seems strikingly like the architecture of another. The size and structure varies but it does get wa little monotonous.In summary. Nice enough if you've a couple of hours to spare but only if you are actually visiting Seoul. I certainly wouldn't make a special trip for many hours just for this.
274,4.0,A visit to Royal palace is worth and must when you are in Seoul City. Quite impressive architecture in a huge area are treat for the eyes and mind. We were there on Sunday and we could interact with the people in traditional outfits in the palace.
275,4.0,This place is huge! It was at the end of the street (from where my hotel was) and I had no idea from the outside that it was so big. The architecture was mind-blowing as we toured room after room.
276,4.0,"Great complex. A guard changing ceremony happens during the day, definitely should be seen. I believe this place should be visited with a guide so every stone and building detail would make more sense."
277,5.0,"Enjoyed a visit here with my 3 year old and 1 year old sons. We explored the palace until we grew tired from the heat then we went to the children's museum that is within the complex. It is free and air conditioned.I was very impressed with how stroller/wheel chair friendly the majority of the compound was and with how nice the bathrooms were overall. If you think you may visit multiple palaces in Seoul over the course of a month, be sure to buy a book of tickets for 10000.00 KRW. It's an especially good savings if you go to Changdeokgung Palace and the Secret Garden."
278,4.0,the palace is very conveniently located from the train station as well as walking distance from the insadong market. There are tours in english language for the tourists but only till 3.30pm; although the palace opens till 6pm. its a great place for sightseeing and is extremely calm and serene.
279,5.0,"Beautiful palace!Caught the subway there - breathtaking first view!Also, the first sight of the Gyeonghoeru Pavillion takes your breath awayTry to catch the changing of the guard"
280,5.0,Royal Guard Changing Ceremony that takes place only twice a day was fantiastic. The 3 museums in the palace were the among the best in the world and they were free.
281,5.0,A must visit. Just go for a walk around the lakes! Fish can be seen everywhere.... Many places to go through
282,5.0,A must see in Seoul. A great insight in Korean past with monumental building in combination with small more intimate locations.
283,5.0,"A true exmple of Korean spirit of persistance, perseverance and art.Huge wooden structures.....nicely decorated place yet exhibiting simplycity of Korean Emperors.They keep organising cutural shows there dipicting ancient traditions and stories as well. Which makes it a must go attraction in seoul.Nicely Managed place.......be ready to walk a long stretch to cover every part of it."
284,5.0,"Superb architecture. Very interesting mix of buildings, gardens and temples. It has a good restaurant and is just besides a metro station."
285,4.0,"with a very good guide, one can learn a lot from this place. loved the ""changing of guards"" ceremony with actor-guards in complete costumes."
286,5.0,Great Place to be. Wonderful seeing the guards hand over ceremony in the morning. The views inside are great. Guided tours In Englishare  even more fascinating. Dont miss the photo spot near the ponds inside.
287,5.0,"We arrived at 10am to see the changing of the guard ceremony which was really fun to see.  Then we bought our tickets and waited for the start of the English tour.  The grounds are massive, so allow enough time here.  We only spent 30 minutes in the Folk Museum which was not nearly enough time, but we were in a hurry.  I'm still amazed at how reasonable entrance fees are in Seoul--just three dollars US for this place. I highly recommend seeing this palace."
288,5.0,We learned a lot about the history of this palace and the effect that the poor relations with the Japanese has had on this treasure.  Most of it has been rebuilt.  Go on the hour when there is a changing of the guard.
289,5.0,"It was only coincidental that we went during the eve of the Lunar New Year, but it was great that we did because we got to see some traditional performances outside the National Folk Museum just beside the palace grounds. We also got the chance to have a free photo-taking session dressed up in traditional Korean costumes. The palace and its grounds were also amazing, like you were in a Korean historical drama, and everything was covered with snow, so it was such a great scene to take in. We were also lucky enough to see the changing of the palace guards at Gwanghwamun. This is a must place to visit in Seoul!"
290,4.0,Worth a visit for a glimpse of historic Seoul.  The changing of the guard (a few times a day) is fun to see and hear.  The palace is wonderful to see juxtaposed between the mountain on one side and the modern city on the other.  The place is massive.  You could explore for hours easily.
291,4.0,This is a must-see if you want to learn and see old Korean style buildings. It is beautiful. Do not miss the change of the guards. Easy to combine with the shopping area (authentc Korean style) Insadong on walking distance.
292,4.0,"Nice place to take photos.  Quite a bit smaller than the Forbidden City in Beijing.  But, there distinct differences in the Chinease architecture and the Korean one.  But, you have to look for it.  If you find it, its work the visit.  Especially, if you arrive in time for the ""Changing of the Guards""."
293,4.0,The palace and grounds give a feeling of serenity in the middle of the city. Gradually being restored to its former glory. Worth a visit to escape the bustle of the city and exceptionally good value
294,3.0,You need to know in advance when you would like to visit as this place has weird times for visitors. They seem to favour tour groups.
