0,1.0,"1. You need a mask to protect yourself. Indoor air quality is worst. There is a smoking room but smoke smell is all over the casino. I stayed for 4 hours one day but I had suffered to breathing and I lost my voice.2. I met rudest players there. They put their membership cards at their favorite slot machine and they were blocking other players to access while they are even not playing for hours! and the casino doing nothing to these rude players let them keep doing this.카지노에서 신경 좀 쓰셔야죠! 플레이 중 싸인을 걸어 둔다거나 맴버쉽 카드를 머신에 끼워 놓고 1 시간 이상씩 게임 하지 않고 남도 못하게 하는 그런 사람들을 어떻게 관리를 않하시나요?3. I saw one player spit out on the floor so disgusting! 4. Lots slot machines are broken and and old.5.The employees are not very kind.6.The slot machines are so close each other so when it is crowed, the rude players without saying ""excuse' or ""sorry"" just rudely passed by me.7.The casino needs more aware to watch their guests. Most players are Chinese Korean, Chines and some Japanese and other Asians..... YOU'LL KNOW WHO THEY ARE!!!"

Later, the lady said she couldn't read Alphabet - did not know what was written in the card who clearly recognized the same alphabet in the passport later. She lied again claiming that she was an immigration officer who can deny the entry based on her own judgement. While the validity of US passport card for a casino entry remain to be debated, her attitude and response was not professional nor pleasant. Will not visit there again, never."
2,1.0,"All the other reviews sum up the basic idea of this place, small, cramped, and not very fun when compared to a place like Vegas.  I sat down at a slot machine and I there was no one around.  I stupidly put in my voucher of 23,000 won into the machine and looked up to see that someone else had left a Players Card in the machine.  Before I knew it the owner returned and started slapping my hand as I tried to hit the help button.  A manager came over and I explained the situation, but the final result was sorry...there is nothing we can do.  So the guy basically assaulted me and got to gamble with my money with no compensation from the casino.  This place is a money pit."

I was betting a significant amount (10x minimum) and was told the beer cart would be around once an hour. Just to get a ten ounce paper cup of beer. Interesting. I joined the club, and hope that over time, as I play recreationally, service will get better."
4,2.0,It's a small casino.  Not much choices in machines.  Some table games are available.The service staffs at the entrance of the Casino are less than friendly in attending to players.I guess you will not miss much to omit this place though it is known to be one of the bigger casino within Seoul.Smoking rooms are disgusting.  Smokers are spitting into ash trays and some were noted to have done the spitting on the floor.  Not an uncommon sight in Korea though.
