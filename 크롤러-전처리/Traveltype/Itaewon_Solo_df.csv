0,4.0,Great neighborhood for an evening out and when you feel you’d like a drink and meeting a place where locals and foreigners mix at ease.Many bars to chose from and generally an easy going atmosphere. Worth a visit!
1,4.0,"I was quite impressed with this neighbourhood because it had all the makings of a seedy area, but it was lit as far as I could tell. Good bars, high end restaurants, safe atmosphere - yeah, well worth a pub crawl down here again!"
2,5.0,They have a Mosque and muslim centre there. A lot of muslim and halal food. Its very convenient for those who choose to know about Korean Muslim culture.
3,4.0,"There is one famous town named ‘Itaewon’ in the center of Seoul, the capital city of South Korea. This time, I want to recommend one Kebab restaurant in front of Itaewon station. The name of restaurant was ‘Ankara’. So I firstly thought that the capital city of Turkey is Ankara not Istanbul. Anyway the price of Kebab is a bit expensive but I don’t give anyting about the price. Just the taste of it. It tastes really good and It fitted to me. It is a bit spicy and a bit creamy and the lamb.이태원은 내가 가장 좋아하는 서울의 핫플레이스중 하나이다. 필자는 이태원에 가면 항상 들리는 곳이 있는데 그 곳중 하나는 바로 케밥을 파는 가게이다. 이태원 역을 나오면 역 앞에 있는 카페 바로 맞은 편에 자그맣게 차려져 있는 케밥가게를 볼 수가 있다. 가격은 대게 6000원에서 7000원 정도. 이정도 가격이면 내가 자주가는 순대국집에서 맛있는 순대국 한 그릇 정도 먹을 수 있는 가격이지만 그 정도는 개의치 않는다. 케밥을 먹을 수 있다면 말이지."
4,4.0,I'm not into Itaewon a lot because it's mostly for people who love to party. This is where pub crawls usually happens and the like. One thing I like tho is that this place is near the War Museum of Korea. I should explore this place a lot more when I come back. ;)
5,3.0,"This area has more foreigners than other part of Seoul does. Many are selling halal food such us Middle Eastern, Indonesian, or Malay food, but there is also one or two restaurant selling halal Korean food (I recommend you going to Eid for halal bulgogi). There are also some halal stores selling halal food but don't expect them to be Korean brand - they are all imported so the price may be higher. Basically Itaewon is good for muslim who are living in Seoul but still needs to perform halal living while nonmuslim can spend night out at bars and restaurants. For tourism, the only thing I can recommend is halal Korean restaurant and the great mosque (even it's not really nice place to visit)"
6,5.0,"The locals call Itaewon ""foreigner central"". You can experience the whole world in this one area. Nightlife here is often considered the best in Korea, but also the most rough."
7,4.0,"Party area of Seoul. Long road of bars and restaurants. Busy. Lively. Bright lights. A place for locals, tourists and off duty US soldiers to have some food and drink. Good place to go for some night life"
8,5.0,Itaewon is truly a mesh and mixture of people from everywhere.  The streets are alive with cadences of world languages and smells fill the air from restaurants serving foods from all over the world.  The weekends are wall to wall bar hoppers and party people.  A must see when in Seoul.
9,5.0,"This is the best place to go out and party in Seoul. I really love this hood, it has a  great atmosphere and you can find any type of bar in here. This is also the area where all foreigners go for drinks. You can drink on the street. I would suggest to hit B1 Club, Bliss, thursday party and U bar."
10,1.0,"Imagine a place with the most obnoxious and loud tourists (and some other, equally unpleasant 'locals') , tacky aesthetics, ridiculously overpriced restaurants and you get Itaewon. Even the air manages to be smellier and more polluted than in other parts of Seoul. If you're visiting Seoul or Korea and want to see the impressive and beautiful parts of it, avoid it at all cost."
11,3.0,"You know when your here as you will be surrounded by cafes and foreign restaurants. Incredibly boring during the day though you can get a good lunch at many different places, the evening is when this place livens up.If you want to experience Korea or actually have a meaningful holiday I would advise you to avoid this place.If you are in Korea to party and hangout with other foreigners or perhaps you are an expat who wants to be somewhere a little more diverse, then come here."
12,5.0,"Itawon is a touristy or expat area in Seoul but is still worth a visit. There are many souvenir and craft shops. In the back alleys there are many bars frequented by tourists, expats and locals alike. There are also a number of clubs for later in the evening if that's your thing. The vibe in Itawon is exciting which adds it to the list of must visits when in Seoul."
13,5.0,"This is the place where you can find a different type of local, it's expatiate area. There are plenty of bars, clubs and restaurants for any taste and any cuisine. And I guess this is the beloved place for all Korean expats.Apart from that it's a very beautiful area with lots of tiny street, hills and great views."
14,3.0,"I understand this is a tourist/expat area but it is also very much known as an international area in terms of culture and food.  That is often a great combination in my experience.  Unfortunately, in Itaewon many(not all of course) of the expats seem to really dumb down the area with a lot of ugly, disrespectful, obnoxious behavior(no need to say where they are from).  I'm all for expats blowing off some steam because I have been one, but I was surprised how rude so many expats were in this area while in the pubs, restaurants and even on the streets.  It's just my experience and opinion but that was disappointing especially since I expected I would love this area.  On the positive side, if one is able to avoid the neanderthals mentioned above, there really is a ton of great little spots for dinner and drink.  Whatever you are craving for food you will find it, from all over the world.  There is a lot of trendy little places as well as a few local food joints if you look. There is also the subway station so it's easy to get to and from.  As a tourist, I would not stay in this area again.  It's just simply not Korea.  I would stay in a different area of Seoul and just visit Itaewon for an evening.  As an expat, this is possibly a good area if craving some western interaction but its not a typical expat area."
15,3.0,"Itaewon main road including direct side roads has many shops and offers food from all over the world. Bars, Lounges, Clubs and Pubs are available to get you a nice evening. The area is always busy and crowded. Especially on the weekends. Itaewon main road is not Korea from the security point of view. Don't leave your  valuables unattended. Be prepared that about hundred nations are visiting the place at the same time. And early morning drunken bodies hanging around. Anyway you either like the place or not. It is a nice place to be out for some drinks but if you want to move nearby you should check it out before."
16,4.0,"If you want to enjoy summer breeze, a nice walk in a relaxed atmosphere and try food from around the world, this is the place to go."
17,5.0,"Beautiful place to shop, almost as though it is a museum to me. Easy access from subway stations. Souvenir goods are a bit pricey by 1000 to 2000 KRW if compared to those you can get in Myeongdong area, but in terms of variety and aesthetic preference, Itaewon shopping area is a lot better. Also safe for female solo travelers - I went there alone. Lots of families and couples are around to shop. BTW I came here simply because of an episode of Running Man (a popular variety show in South Korea), and I tell you, the place is a lot more beautiful compared to what I saw on the show. Will return here, definitely."
18,3.0,"Well, not quite sure what title to put my review. You will either like or don't like it. Being born and grown up in a country that is pretty international, I don't quite like Itaewon. To me, it's just like an international town. You can probably find all kinds of cuisine here. However, I must say that some of their shopping lanes are good. I came across this shop that does embroidery and is patronize by a lot of tourists to get their luggage tag, caps and even clothes embroidered. This shop was featured on the tv before as well."
19,2.0,"I was expecting a better vibe from the Itaewon area, but I was sorely disappointed. I had heard that it was a fun, eclectic, international area, but I found it to be overly rowdy and much less interesting than other districts. As an American, I was embarrassed by the loud (even shouting!) U.S. tourists on the long side streets and unimpressed by the restaurant offerings. It seemed to attract people who wanted the experience of Seoul, but didn't want to actually go out and explore the city. Lots of tacky older couples and older teenagers. Save your time and go somewhere more fun (eg. anywhere else in the city)."
20,4.0,This area is nice to mosey about. There are many other cultures here to experience. I just enjoyed walking about without much of an aim so that I could just take in the area.
21,5.0,"Loved this crazy area of seoul. Lots of shops and restaurants in crazy shapes, a must! One part is mostly fashion stores and then there is a dedicated foodstreet as well!"
22,5.0,"As i informed here is new touristic part of seoul witch many foreigners comes, with many international restaurant,brands and bars."
23,4.0,Very nice town especially those who are looking for muslim food. There is also a supermarket that sells all halal food items.
24,5.0,one of the few books store that sell English books in Seoul.also one of the few areas to get American sized clothes
25,4.0,"I very much enjoyed my frequent visits to Itaewon while working nearby.  I learned to love the local food, but was grateful for the Western alternatives too.  Shopping for gifts to send home was fun and reasonably priced.  I also purchased tailor-made suits, uniforms, and specialty jackets here.  Great craftsmanship."
26,4.0,"Itaewon is very accepting for foreigners. Not only does it have the highest concentration of foreign (non-Korean) peoples, it has a lot of food and almost everything speaks some sort of English here. So if you feel like you do not understand anyone in other parts of Seoul, come here and order food!"
27,5.0,Its  hang out place mainly for Young crowd where you can party late nite on weekends. There are many night clubs playing good music. This place also has good Indian and Pakistani restaurant. You can also do shopping in this area.For Indian people you can get Indian grocery in this area
28,3.0,"Itawon is a mix culture area with different ethnic groups, there is a mosque for Muslims and churces for Christians.  There is a US Army facilities in Itaewon; you can hear people speak English in Itaewon.  Interesting place in Seoul."
29,4.0,The blend of food in terms of variety and quality is highly appreciated and therefore recommended - place can be explored on foot with international shopping centre too
30,4.0,"First time in Seoul, this has to be the most diverse area in the whole of South Korea!night life in this area is okay-ish. As I am not really a night life kinda person!"
31,3.0,"As someone who came to Korea to expand her Korean language skills, I don't find a reason to go to Itaewon except for International restaurants. There are way better neighborhood to explore in Seoul."
32,5.0,"This place has a Korean soul but a western spirit. It has some best options for international cuisine, international brands for shopping and a great area to walk around and enjoy some night life."
33,2.0,"apart from the beautiful mosque, there were many brothels and massage parlours especially just behind the ITW hotel. I was not given chage at a cafe near the Itaewon subway. I went yo Kim's gym, which is near the Helios club, up a flight of steep stair case, leading up yo a love motel, where transgender Koreans ply their trade. The gym itself was very basic with uneven floor but has a power rack and a bar bell, and two bench presses. The male toilet has no hand basin but a hose. You pay 8k won per casual visit. You have to take your street shoes off on enetring the gym, but you can wear thick socks or bring a pair of gym shoes."
34,4.0,"I'm in Itaewon all the time, at least twice a month, as I rent art studio space there. I enjoy the area very much, there's plenty of great places to eat, some good shopping, and if you're in the mood for it, some good night life. Itaewon is the 'foreigner' district, so there are plenty of different people about - various European and African countries are represented here, among others - which means various tastes for food are catered for."
35,5.0,"My guesthouse was located just near a main street in Itaewon and I really like all the availabilty of services, restaurants and shops !"
36,3.0,"Streets of shops and malls. Nothing Special. Go to have a look especially at night. Best to stroll along the World Food Street at itaewon. If you willing to spent, there got lots of resturant, bars,pub for chill out. For budget traveler, best to have a look around the street for better pricing. As the restaurant, don't come cheap. Beer either. Tourist area!! I just walk 2 rounds then head off to other location."
37,3.0,"It was a street of shops and a mall, that's it. Nothing jumped out at me and I walked through it very quickly on my way to another attraction. This wasn't for me but it might be someone else's thing so I will just say lots of shops, lots of things-cheap and expensive."
38,4.0,"Read a lot about Itaewon & was recommended by all. But felt it was overhyped. Yes for a change it's multicultural & multiracial area. It's in close proximity to the American base. Has lot of eating options- Indian, Arabic, especially Halal food is freely available. Also provisions for buying Indian food stuff from either the foreign food mart( More variety & options)or National food mart( Costly).Market area transforms into party area in the evening & night."
39,5.0,The Wit's End is small spot out of the way that you can actually smoke. Good selection of scotch and beer. The bartender speaks perfect English. I stop there every time I am in town. This place isn't over crowded so it's a good place to take a date. It's clean as well.
