1,4.0,"It's a very large complex with international brands of shops, Hyundai department store with supermarket, library, restaurants, cinema, five-star hotel (Intercontinental), conference centre, aquarium, food court, City Air Terminal that can do flight check-in. Our itinerary of that day was to have a fabulous seafood lunch in Garak seafood market (metro station #817), then took 6 stops to Samseong station (#219) where COEX mall is located, strolled around for a few hours, bought some food in supermarket before taking a taxi at Intercontinental Hotel back to our hotel apartment in city centre. Very enjoyable and convenient. Worth spending half day here. A cozy and clean mall."

Took the subway to COEX.nice cafe ""mamas"" at the entrance of the subway which led to the mall.Eateries are aplenty, but prices are definitely upmarket though not expensive per se.The Aquarium and a couple of Korean popstars exhibits and themed museum are all within the huge building, co-joining the exhibition halls, as well as the Hotel Inter-continental.A good walk for 2-3hra is recommended, esp if the outdoors too hot, or raining."
