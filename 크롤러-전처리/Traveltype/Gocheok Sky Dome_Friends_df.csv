0,4.0,"Went to my first every baseball game (Nexan Heroes VS Lotte Giant's) and even though it was a poor game there was a very good atmosphere, although I suspect it was mostly from the noisy Lotte Giant away fans. The stadium is a massive indoor arena and is nice and cool with the aircon on. Good food and plenty of variety within and outside the stadium and there is a quaint little fan shop where you can find all the essential merchandise and also very fancy jackets. I also enjoyed the product competitions during the breaks in play even though I don't understand Korean, I found it really entertaining. I am not a baseball fan but I might consider going to other matches in the future because of this match. Good location for the stadium near subway station and there is also some futsal football pitches next to the stadium of you fancy a kickabout before the game."
1,4.0,I was here last year during bigbang final concert in seoul before they left for army . Yhe stadium is HUGE . Definitely a good place for a concert and it's indoor that's a plus for me !
2,5.0,"DAEBAAKKKK!!!! The dome was so huuuge and easy transport using subway, like a minute walk from guil station. If it wasnt for winter iâ€™d love to explore the area.I ate at nearby restaurant after concert, and the chicken taste sooo delicious but i forget to take pic and the name of the restaurant :("
3,5.0,"The Gocheok Sky Dome is one of the most interesting baseball parks I have visited. It is far from a ball park in the U.S., but it is wonderful in it's unique way. The building is massive and the creative design is a sight to see. Inside the park is not so much impressive, but it has a couple of highlights. At the top of the dome natural light comes through and you can catch the silhouettes of airplanes passing by. Being there for the World Baseball Classic it was great to sit, watch, and listen. The acoustics are excellent which makes for a great experience for a ball game since Koreans like to cheer during the game. I would try to avoid sitting far down the first or third base line because the seats do not turn at an angle and have you head turning during the game. Outside and under the Sky Dome there is a small mall with a whole bunch of food choices. There is even pizza! There is also a small convince store to grab a beer and a video arcade to pass the time. You do have a choice to bring in your own food/beer inside the ball park if you want, but concessions inside are not expensive. Just personal preference on what you want to eat or drink."
4,5.0,"Amazing experience! Although smaller than expected, the Dome looks great inside! Would love to come back"
