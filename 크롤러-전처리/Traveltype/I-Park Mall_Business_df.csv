0,4.0,"A vast mall with an atypical inside layout: one area on several floors in about food, another one about fashion, then you have luxury goods and perfumes, and finally a good mix of bookstores, electronics, home goods etcQuite a busy place actually, maybe it is because it was around lunch time.The whole facility is clean and modern, and people are courteous although not everyone spoke English.Interesting place if you have got a couple of hours to kill."
