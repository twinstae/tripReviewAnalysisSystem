0,5.0,"There were minimal visitors, so it was peaceful to wander around.  The palace area is small compared to others.  Nevertheless, the roof and ceilings of the buildings are beautifully painted.  Perhaps as the colors are still so bright, the palace looks new, hence, not visited by many tourists.  There is a park at the back outside the palace and you can see locals exercising or practicing martial art."
1,4.0,"Beautiful palace complex with stunningly intricate wooden buildings and amazing colours. It's so peaceful and quiet inside and it makes for a lovely place to sit and contemplate.  Seoul is a lovely city blessed with stunning places and this is right up there with the best of them in my opinion. Take your time, relax and take it all in."

3,5.0,This was the third palace I visited while exploring and enjoying my Trip in South Korea. I honestyLoved the views and the history behind it. This one was the main and largest palace. Expect to see the beautiful golden dragon sculptures on the ceiling of this hall. There was much history in one place.. The artifacts still intact until this day-well maintained and preserved. The stones where the King's subjects once stood still remain. Great and beautiful place!❤❤
4,3.0,Only visit this palace if you are nearby visiting the Seoul Museum of History. It looks the same as every other palace and the throne room is the only thing there is to see. If you have been to other palaces in Seoul you could skip this one without missing anything.
