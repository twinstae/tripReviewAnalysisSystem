0,3.0,"The surroundings were beautiful, as you can see from the photos. I wasn’t overly excited by the shrine itself. Nonetheless, it was interesting to learn about the king, prince and spirits and the pathways designated to them through the shrine."
1,5.0,"You can only enter the shrine as part of a tour. Even though we arrived 5 minutes after the English tour had started, they hurried us in so that we could catch up with the group. The place was beautiful and so peaceful. Our wonderful tour guide gave us a thorough history of the shrine and explained all the concepts simply. The shrine wasn’t too busy therefore we were able to enjoy the area as a small group and take many photos that were not filled with people! We would definitely recommend for an admission fee of 1000won (67p)!"
2,5.0,Great Confucian shrine of the entire Joseon Dynasty. The guided tour was well organised and informative. As a UNESCO World Heritage site shouldn’t be missed during the visit in Seoul.
3,4.0,"It appears that you need to move around the site in guided groups without the ability to wander as you wish.  The disadvantage of this is that the guide who only spoke Korean spent a lot of time at each stop. He appeared to be knowledgeable but it meant much time waiting to move with the group when we could have been through the site in a much quicker time or spent more time taking photos when a lot of people where all milling around.The grounds had a lovely display of autumn colours.Also, people over 64 are given free entry but need some identification like a Passport to verify age."
4,3.0,"Visited with a friend who booked us on an English guided tour. The shrine is a very important place as it houses the spirit tablets of deceased Kings and Queens and was one of the first structures built in the Joseon dynasty. Ceremonies are still held there and the interiors are open for viewing on 1 May every year if I remember correctly. The tour took us round the buildings which we can only see from the outside and we were told about the raised platforms/walkways - in palaces the highest is for the King but in shrines the most raised path in the middlle is for spirits. There are only limited times, I think Saturdays, where it's permitted to wander around the grounds without a guide. Unfortunately the guide we had was so poor she was incomprehensible most of the time so I would much have preferred to have been given the freedom to wander round on my own and read any information boards available. My Korean friend found the guide hard to understand to. A real shame."
5,5.0,The visit I made to this shrine for one of the English language tours was a real highlight of my brief visit to Seoul. I would highly recommend the tour - the group was not too large and the commentary provided interesting. It was fascinating to learn about the shrine's history and the belief systems associated with it. Our guide would point out elements of design that were in line with feng shui principles and she provided lots of useful context.I loved how mortals are not allowed to walk on the path reserved for the spirits..!The trees and blossom at the shrine were very pretty and we were lucky enough to spy some racoons who had made their home in the proximity of one of the shrine buildings.
6,5.0,"Admission fee at only 1000krw (500krw between 7 to 18 yrs old, under 7 and above 64 free entry), Jongmyo shrine is a wonderful visit. Unlike the palaces, this is a shrine an therefore  you could only enter as a guided tour. There are guided tours with Korean/ English/ Japanese or Chinese speaking guides. Please look up the photos attached for more information.Generally speaking, my sister and I have been to all the palaces and weren't expecting much from this shrine as it was off the beaten path and ""usual"" attractions that tourists would opt for (as it sounds a little more solemn)However for the entry price, the view and a guide to guide you through the rites, customs and korean psyche, why Not?Without giving too much spoilers, would recommend tourists to give this place a chance. The tour itself will only take 1 hour. Certainly easy to slot into your busy day. You could also then walk from this shrine to Changgyeonggung palace (20 minutes walk at an extremely slow pace. It was only 12 minutes for sis and I)Hope you like it"
7,5.0,Best to take a guided tour to totally understand what it meant for their ancestors.  Love it's serene surrounding and its purpose.
8,5.0,Information about the deceased was interesting and the landscape was beautiful. Good place to visit on your trip.
9,5.0,"Located at Jongno3(sam)-ga Station (Seoul Subway Line 1, 3, 5) and Exit 11. An interesting place to visit. Many locals gather there to play chess which could be an interesting sight to see. Free admission with guided tour at different timings. Good for a historic tour :)"
10,4.0,"Lovely area and easy to get to, however, we were there on an event day...so the place was packed with people and much of the shrine was restricted.What we were able to see was peaceful and nice."
11,5.0,This is beautiful shrine. It is dedicated to Korean Kings and queens of Joseon Dynasty. There is fee of 3000 KW. and for foreigner it is compulsory to have guide except Saturday. It is worth to have guide so that you get to know actual history of shrine which some interesting.
12,5.0,"Only can visit with accompany of tour guide from the shrine. They are very funny, I really enjoy listening to them telling stories & explain to us about the ceremony & how late kings & queens are buried.Although it doesn't have much colours compare to palace, this place is peaceful & relaxing."
13,4.0,Its unesco world heritage place. Very beatiful place n only can be visited with guide tour. The admission ticket only 1000 won.
14,4.0,"They have screening of a movie that details what's done in the shrine. It's a confutionist shrine, which mean he looks basically like all the other historical buildings in Seoul. Nice stroll, not much about it."
15,5.0,We went there on a weekday so it is required to have a guided tour. It was very interesting. The tour guide was very nice and answered a lot of my parents' questions about history in Korea. The place is not as crowded like the other palaces around town. Mostly because you need a tour guide to get in. You won't regret it if you like the history.
16,5.0,Since we have visited the shrine during a festival we could see a free traditional show with actors dressed up in 17th century royal korean outfits. There was a photo session time as well as recreation of an event from 17th century. The Shrine itself is nice and it is a place where the spirits of dead kings and queens visit and are summoned according to Korean tradition
17,5.0,"You can reach this shrine via train at Jong-no station exit 11. Then you just have to walk less than 5 minutes to reach the shrine. We visited on a Thursday so there were few tourist in the area which is good. They are not open on Tuesdays and some other days require you to have a tour guide so before you visit, I suggest you double check their schedule online. We got lucky they let us in on that day without a tour guide. There is an entrance fee of 1k won for adults. The shrine was huge and the red gates were really pretty. There is a changing of guards ceremony every 2PM and that is also something to look forward to."
18,4.0,This is a UNESCO site and it's got lots of history inside.  You can only visit this by joining one of the free guided tour.  We had a lovely lady guide taking us around.  She's very informative and quite funny which made the visit more interesting.Enjoyed our time there.
19,4.0,"It's a cool place, be sure to pay attention to all the tour information, really interesting historic place. On ceremony day, the doors are open and you get to watch a nice ceremony with music and ceremonial clothing.(Be sure not to walk on the stone path, you'll get the full explanation on the tour)."
20,4.0,"Take note that visit to this UNESCO site must be on guided tour basis on all days except Tuesday (closed) & Sat.Limited foreign speaking tours so do take note of timing before visiting to save time.English tours: 10am, 12pm, 2pm & 4pmChinese tours: 11am, 1pm & 3pm.Japanese tours: 9am, 9.40am and once every hour thereafter until 3.40pm (last tour). We reached the shrine at around 12.40pm and was lucky that we understood Chinese and could go for the 1pm tour. As it was a cold day, there were not many visitors and we were the only 2 in the Chinese tour so we had the privilege of having Ms Lee as our private tour guide! Ms Lee spoke perfect Chinese and was very knowledgeable on the history of Josen. Her detailed explanation helped to add meaning into the architectural structure and the history behind it. She's also very approachable and open to questions. A very quality free tour which help us appreciate more of the shrine!At the end of the tour, Ms Lee even gave us her heat pack as it was a very cold day and she knew that we are going to visit more places thereafter. A good place to start if you want a general overview of Korean history and kings/queens."
21,5.0,"If you are interested in Korean history and culture I highly recommend it, it's inexpensive to visit this place with professional English/other languages speaking Guides."
22,4.0,"An interesting and very Solemn place in Seoul. Visitors must take a tour, it's free but only offered at certain times of day.When I went it was not crowded and my tour was very small. We were allowed to roam and take pictures as we pleased."
23,4.0,"This is the place where the ancestral tablets of the emperors and empresses of Korea are. It is a restricted area and you can only visit the place with the guides from the shrine. You can find out the timing from the official website. Admission is 1000 won. We were there early for the English tour so we joined the Mandarin tour at 1pm instead. It is a very simple and short tour, with the guide sharing details of the ceremonial procession at each site. The tour lasted less than 45 mins. When you are there, avoid walking the central line as it is meant for the ancestral spirits. There are signaled informing on this too. To get to jongmyo shrine, take the subway to Jingmo 3-ga station, take exit 8 and walk straight after exiting until you hit a T-junction. Turn right. There are construction works on your left, continue walking until you see the entrance of the shrine."
24,3.0,"Visited here while in Seoul and seeing the temples in the nearby area.  The Shrine allowed only a guided tour, which made the visit much longer that I could have done on my own.  Though interesting from the historical perspective, the Shrine lacked the beautiful grounds like I saw at some of the neighboring palaces.  If seeing all of the sites, then it makes sense to hit this one as well.  But if limited on time, I would recommend seeing the palaces instead."
25,5.0,"Guided tours only at this very spiritual site.The ancestral markers of all the kings and queens of  the Joseon Dynasty are contained within two massive buildings.  The parklands of the shrine are beautiful and teeming with wildlife.  We spotted some rather large black squirrels and a raccoon that was completely unconcerned by our presence.The shrine it's self is austere and solemn while still obviously a place for royalty.  This is a sad place that in many ways marks the end of the Joseon period, but remains important to the spiritual life of Korea.The guides are very knowledgeable and give a great insight into the history of the shrine and its importance."
26,3.0,Peaceful and quiet shrine in the middle of Seoul. I would recommend the palaces over this if you are limited on time. Limited written/multimedia information to absorb.
27,5.0,This shrine is where the spirit tablets of Korea's Joseon kings are kept and venerated.  The annual ceremony that's led by royal descendents every May is impressive and worth observing for an hour or two.  The grounds are pleasantly green and nice for a stroll.
28,4.0,"if you like about history and culture, this attractions will be satisfy you. you will get royal history of korea and a glimpse about korean royal and culture. worth to visit. if you like palaces and historical sites, you better buy integrated ticket for palaces including jongmyo shrine and secret garden tour fro KRW10.000"
29,4.0,"This place houses the spirit tablets of the Joseon Dynasty kings and queens and a ritual ceremony is held once a year, on the first Sunday of May. Centuries ago, ritual ceremonies were held several times a year for the deceased, five times in Jeongjeon Hall and three times in Yeongnyeongjeon Hall.  The Jeongjeon Hall is the main hall , is the most important part of the shrine. In front of this hall stretches a massive elevated stone yard surrounded by walls  on all sides. Initially there were only seven spirit chambers but alterations and additions were made in the coming years until there were 19 spirit chambers making Jeongjeon a very long wooden building. When Jeongjeon could no longer accommodate, Yeongnyeongjeon was built. When it was first built it had six chambers but was expanded to accommodate 16 chambers in the end. Unlike the roof of Jeongjeon  which emphasized the long horizontal line, the centre section of the roof of Yeongnyeongjeonis elevated  Jongmyo shrine is inscribed on the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage List in 1995. You can only visit through a guided tour which lasts for half an hour. Entrance fee  includes the guided tour costs 1000 won"
30,4.0,UNESCO site. Lovely grounds and shrine strictly dedicated to royal ancestors gives visitors an understanding of the Joseon dynasty's grandeur.
31,4.0,"What most literature on this place don't tell you is that you need to follow their free guided tour to get in on normal days. It's only on Sats that you are allowed to view this place on your own. So, do take note of the tour times in the various languages. Otherwise, you could be wasting a lot of your time sitting & waiting for the next tour. Worse still, you have to come again another day."
32,4.0,"From a lot of blog sites, I came to an understanding that this place was like a 'freebie' on the combination ticket we got for the palaces tour in Seoul. Don't be fooled though. This place is just as great as the palaces.We were to go to the Chandeukgung that day but missed out on the closed day (Monday). So we ended up going to Jongmyo Shrine, which is about 15 minutes walk, straight from Chandeukgung. There is lack of street signs but you can ask the people around. We met a Korean guy who couldn't speak English but understood where we were heading too. Similar to the other tours, take note of the guided tours time. If you decide to walk on your own, you may again be wondering what is all the buildings are for and may even step on the wrong path. There's a stone path which is only for spirits. You wouldn't want to be angering any.The tour was interesting and the place was pretty. There guide explained a lot about the buildings. You wouldn't be able to understand a thing if you walked on your own. Tour was about an hour.When we were there, the opposite of the shrine was on renovation. Wasn't sure what was there but looked like it was a worth a visit."
33,5.0,"There are less tourists, so we get to enjoy the serendipity of the place. They have a very interesting culture and unlike the palace, they have a room that shows a video of how the rituals are being done, which helps us to understand more rather than through reading alone. It is a short walk from the train station."
34,5.0,"The Jongmyo shrine is a UNESCO world heritage and dedicated to the kings and queens of an ancient Korean dynasty.It is def. one of Seoul's Highlights and should not be missed at all. Access only with a tour, so it is highly recommended to pre-book one."
35,5.0,"I really think this should rank higher in the list of attractions.  I normally dont like guided tours but this one was really superb.  It was a very interesting, educational and picturesque place."
36,5.0,"After visiting a few palaces that celebrate the lives of the Korean royal families, the Jongmyo Shrine is a totally different experience. This 14th Century Confucian shrine pays tribute to the souls of the royals of the Joseon Dynasty, and is a well deserved listing in the UNESCO World Heritage sites. While the Joseon royals lived in the royal palaces, their bodies were buried in the royal tombs, and here in this royal shrine is kept their souls. Of all the royal sites we visited, this was the only one that was quiet, peaceful and serene throughout our visit, despite the fact that it is in the heart of a busy city. Perhaps this lovely setting is protected by the fact that it is only open to groups except for one day each week, or perhaps we were just lucky, but this serenity was a wonderful antidote to the noise and crowding of most other sites.Consider the all-inclusive ticket that covers admission to four palaces and this lovely shrine. It costs 10,000 Korean Won, about $9.50 US. Once a year in May, there is a ritual event in which the dead are honored and the buildings are opened to reveal the tablets on which the souls are remembered."
37,4.0,We had this tour on a Friday where English language tour was available at 2:00PM.  The place was simple. What makes this place different and interesting is that it showcased Korean culture and their belief on their deceased. The place has quarters for both the living and the deceased.Some of their pathways had a three level where the middle is elevated whereas the two sides were of the same level. It was eerie to learn that the middle is for the spirits so visitors were not encouraged from stepping on this plane.Recommending this tour as it is a tribute to Korean heritage to families and groups as it is interesting.
38,5.0,"We didn't have much time so we went with the Korean tour. It is a beautiful solemn place. In the dead winter, it was majestic.Our guide was kind enough to come to us and explain in a language we understand when she realised we aren't locals.Well worth it. What a gorgeous, serene place!"
39,4.0,"What we see at Jongmyo Shrine today is largely from the early 17th century. However, as the very long ruling Joseon Dynasty lasted five centuries, the shrine required additional constructions to house the spirit tablets of the monarchs. The site is indeed rather austere and solomn. I enjoyed my visit here, but for someone that loves history, the site by its very nature is less engaging than Changdeokgung or the royal tombs.Unfortunately, when I visited in 2008, tours were not required and not regularly held. While I knew much of the history, I would have enjoyed a expert guide. As Jongmyo is just next door to Changdeokgung Palace, you can visit both world heritage sites and learn much about royal life in the Joseon dynasty."
