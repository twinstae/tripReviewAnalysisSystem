0,3.0,"Easy to get here by Gasan Digital Complex station. A short walk of perhaps 5 mins.It's mostly the local korea brands in here without those international branded brands. Good to visit this place if you have time to spare and not a must. Can't really figure out how the pricing works here. Sometimes, there are additional discount off the tag on items we bought. Spent half a day here and we didn't buy much either.We got quite a good deal of 50% at the North Face over at the nearby Lotte outlet."

2,4.0,"Location is near if compared to outlets in paju. Price is little more expensive if compared than paju and the collection is not as large as ones in paju but price wise and time wise it is better to shop here.By the time we get there, we got free car parking. I think it is because some technical error of the operator. But still nice!Oh. And there is lotte outlet too nearby, right next to mario outlet."
