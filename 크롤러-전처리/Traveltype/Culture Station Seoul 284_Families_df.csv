0,4.0,This majestic building as character compares to the new train station. Is is also beautifully lifted up at night. You may actually see this if you are on the road or going to Seoul Station or Namdaemun (from Seoul Station). Do visit this place if you have a chance.
1,3.0,"Located right beside the new Seoul Station is the old one which has some beautiful architectural features. The station is now an art gallery and is easily accessibly from the new station where there are also a Lotte Mart store and many places to eat and shop. Right in front of the old station embedded in the ground is a huge round bronze plate.My recommendation is not to go out of your way to visit the Culture Station Seoul 284, as it might be a little disappointing but if you happen to be at Seoul Station or if it is a rainy day then spend perhaps 30 minutes visiting here."
2,3.0,This is the Former Seoul Station and now it is used as a free exhibition hall.It's good to go inside and take a look half an hour.- The building itself is an attraction with history.- The outside is a wide square. It is often noisy with congregations. And it has homeless people and many pigeons.
3,4.0,"We walked past this on the way back to our hotel and we thought we saw a similar one in Japanâ€™s Tokyo station. Not sure of the significance. There are a lot of homeless men here. This station is no longer used as a train station but is confusingly named as Seoul station, and located beside the active Seoul station."
4,4.0,This is the old Seoul Station turned into a museum. This is a amazing place beacuse architecture from this museum like European style building. You can take the photo with so many spot in this place.
