0,5.0,It was in basement of Conrad Hotel where I was staying. Everything you need under 1 roof.Being Muslim I was looking for halal food and IFC mall is one of the very few places with halal cuisine ( Hummus Kitchen ) in Seoul. Itâ€™s a great place to stay for business travelers.
1,3.0,"I visted the mall coz i was staying at the Conrad and they were connected. 3 floors of the usual international brands, a cinema, a food court and restaurants. Wouldn't go out of the way to visit otherwise."
2,5.0,This mall is very popular among the office crowd durinh weekdays mainly because it's surrounded by office buildings. We had lunch here and went around to see lots of stores for shopping.I particularly liked the design and art installation in the plaza fronting the mall entrance. It's definitely a great place to visit.
3,3.0,"Visited frequently while staying at the Conrad for food options.  Nice variety ranging from fast food (McDonald's, Asian Food Court) to mid-range (On the Border, Cotto for pizza, Chinese) a grocery/convenience/wine shop and various coffee shops.  Since the Conrad has limited restaurants, this was a convenient way to have many options without the need to take a taxi anywhere.  Stores seem to be pretty run of the mill for a mall."
4,4.0,IFC Mall is a good place to shop and visit as it has a mixture of modern stores but also a Korean marketplace. It also has convenient access to the subway and is very clean.
5,4.0,"I was looking for food items near by my hotel and hotel staff recommended to this place. A good place and having food court in basement, Chinese, Korean restaurant and traditional coffee shop.  However, I was looking for some Indian food, which is not available in this place."
6,4.0,Visited twice; once in 2012 and the last in January 2015. A big mall with neat shops and restaurants. Good to visit if you have luxury of time. Enjoy!
7,4.0,"Visited this mall on my last trip to Seoul . Nice well planned out mall with all the good brand shops . A lot of open spaces around for a person to relax after some hard core shopping . They have a food court in the basement , which has a variety of cuisines like Chinese , Korean ,. Thai , continental as well as Indian . All in all a nice mall for shopping and leisure ."
8,4.0,The mall is very good with lot of top brands. Has an amazing food court.It took me nearly 1 full day to completely see the mall.Only Drawback is they dont have a Currency Exchage counter hence before you go enchash the currency in a nearby bank.
9,4.0,"The food court is well worth visiting. A good selection of restaurants (including McDonalds and On The Border, not that I would ever go there). Some authentic Korean food too, all of it high quality and reasonably priced. Several high end stores."
