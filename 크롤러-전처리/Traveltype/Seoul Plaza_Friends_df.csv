2,5.0,I spent 10 days in the Plaza Seoul hotel and I had a great time! The service is excellent and the rooms very comfortable. The facilities and mostly the gym are very convenient as well. I definitely recommend this hotel!
3,4.0,"This plaza was right between our hotel (Plaza) and City Hall.  It is a nice green area, but with no trees.  There was a rain/harmonica festival going on and there was a splash park for kids.  Metro stop was across the street. Great statue/fountain or a dog!"
4,5.0,"I would have to top rate the hotel, the staffs are very well train and speak good english.  The location is a prime location and I can walk under the tunnel to the Lotte Department Store Duty Free.  The room is quite small but clean, there are a pastry shop underground which i like the most.  At night around the hotel there are a lot of restaurants where you can eat and the price was inexpensive."
