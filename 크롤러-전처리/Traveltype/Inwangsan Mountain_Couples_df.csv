0,5.0,A great hike and not too difficult. We took The Fortress Trail as well from close to the top of Iwangsan. To get there take the train to Dongnimmun and then take the Muak-dong exit. Just follow the road uphill until you see the Iwangsan trail sign.
1,5.0,"Inwangsan was a great walk - we headed up from Dongnimmun, past Seonbawi and then connected to the City Wall and followed it back down. Beautiful flowers by the wall on the way back down with panoramic views stretching from the Blue House, over Gyeongbokgung to N Seoul Tower. We easily fit our tip into a morning's excursion from the Namdaemun area. Didn't see any of the security guards or 'no cameras' signs others have mentioned but perhaps we did not go high enough (we were satisfied with the views from the city wall and did not reach to the summit).You can take a bus or train to Dongnimmun from central Seoul to the start of the walk. Heading north from Dongnimmun (where you can stop for a photo at Dongnimmun Gate) ascend through steep residential streets. Head past a tiger mural and up some steps by a giant bell in a pavilion. Go past a shamanic temple (there was a gut on while we were there) and up to Seonbawi - a weird rock. We headed up to a large rock shelf up from Seonbawi and followed some locals to connect to the city wall route."

3,5.0,The location is just 10 minutes walk from famous Gyeongbokgung palace. It only takes aroung 1 hour 40 minutes to finush the course with the normal speed. Really recomnended for beginner hikers.
4,4.0,This was fun! You can get great views and good exercise without going to the highest summit. We went as high as we would then found lots of other paths to explore. There are many ways to access this mountain- from steps to paved paths. It was enjoyable and gave us views we’d not seen before.
5,5.0,"The view from the mountain is really thrilling, though it's very difficult to climb on it. But it's worth it"
6,4.0,"Arriving in Dongnimun, we, my best friend and I found stairs at the left side of the entry. Following the stairs, a small shrine and temple, as well as big stones to pray to appeared. We followed the pathway and with some luck we found ourselves to be at the Namsan wall. We then followed the way all the way till the end. On the mountain, nature provides an amazing view over Seoul. One can see the President House (Blue-roofed house). Finally, we proceeded to go down the wall, which also turned out to be a picturesque place as well. I ended up to be somewhere in the middle of nowhere. But in the end, we found our way to Dongnimun again. In total, I have to say that it is one of the most amazing attraction I have done so far in Seoul. The view is especially picturesque in the autumn and winter, so around October and November. All the small places with a breathtaking view really are my highlights of Seoul, so I very much suggest to bring a camera, to capture these moments. The route is also quite tiring and may not be very appropriate for people with a fear of heights or small children. It is also very windy up there, so feel free to bring a pull-over. Water may also be brought with. What also needs to be considered, is time. This activity takes about three to four hours. Early in the morning, there are not many people around there, but it is much fresher than on the day. Traveller tip: the sunrise and sunsets are absolutely magnificent."
7,5.0,"it's great to climb a mountain in the heart of the city, short walk (2 - 5 hours depends on which route u pick), great view, but make sure u know how to get there by bus. two idiots jumped onto a cab and the driver didn't understand english, at all. we used google map google translate but could get us nowhere. communication totally broke down. we had to stop the cab and get out in the middle of the road. luckily the trail ran alongside the road! there's a strong military presence so photography is strictly prohibited in most of the places on mountain."
8,3.0,"The hike up Inwangsan is a nice way out of the city for a few hours.  There are some awesome views of the city and the defensive wall makes an interesting contrast with the modern towers of Seoul.  It has some steep sections, but it is definitely a part of the capital that is less travelled and worth seeing."
9,5.0,"This is a well kept up trail that offers beautiful views of Northern Seoul. It offers not only pleasing asthetics, but is also a great way to understand Seoul's history and culture."
