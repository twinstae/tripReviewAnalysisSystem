1,3.0,"If you are in company eveb better: nice walk, nice cycling and on fridays and saturdays there are food trucks with music show, nice but don't expect too much"
2,5.0,Love my first cycling experience here with its perfect cool breeze from Hangang River and great place for picnic. Too bad I was alone but greatly enjoyed the view.
3,3.0,"There is is a huge area to walk around with little to see except people with dogs,boats passing on the water.You can hire a bike which would be the most practical way of seeing the entire area.The must see place is Banpo bridge at night with the coloured water jets at 7.30,8,8.30 and 9pm."
4,4.0,"I love coming here, especially during nice weather. You can just walk along the river, or rent a bike. Bike rental are nearby and it is cheap and easy to rent."
5,5.0,"Accessible to Seoul Metro.Great place to hang out, chill and relax.You can get a spot just to sit and enjoy the view while watching performances.Would really recommend for travelers. ="
6,4.0,I've come here for 3 times. It's a big place with the fresh air. I love walking beside the river. Cheer!
7,5.0,Good stretch of pedestrian/bike path without much elevation change. Great for any activity. You can make your run or bike shorter or longer depending on how you feel and where you decide to cross over to other side from one of the many bridges across Han River.
8,5.0,"There are several areas that are Hanggang park. There are parts where a nice stroll or bike ride.  Some have soccer fields, basket ball courts, swimming pools.  There are usually convenience stores or some cafe/restaurant.  Check out more specific reviews for the park (ie Banpo, Ichon, Mayo, Yeouido, Ttukseom, Jamwon... maybe more...) that you actually want to visit because there are differences between the parks and locality may make it better options for day or night."
9,5.0,"Went here on my own one cold December night. I had the park to myself so I grabbed the chance to take photos of the park. It was beautiful, even at night.I decided to head to the nearby Mini-Stop which sold ramen in aluminium bowls. I also had some sausages along with my ramen. Yumyum!I strolled a little bit more to walk off the heavy meal I just had. It was very cold that night but it was memorable."
10,4.0,"Gwangnaru Hangang Park is a series of parks along the Han River and is located between Gangdongdaegyo and Jamsilcheolgyo. The park covers a very large area. It is for recreational purposes only. The river Han runs through it. No commercial boat activity is allowed between Seoul and the mouth of the river. The river provides clean water.  The park is made up of large areas of reeds and other aquatic vegetation. There are sports facilities comprising of football pitches, basketball and volleyball courts, tennis courts, fitness centres and an inline skate rink. There is also a large swimming pool. There is a large biking area and there are bike lanes.There are stalls selling snacks etc."
11,4.0,Really enjoyed my walk along the river.  Get to see many interesting bridges and some great views.Very busy with bike riders especially on weekends. Can combine it with Seoul Forest
12,5.0,"in spring season, nice palace to walk. you can order delievery food near by han river. night time, beautiful night view there"
13,4.0,"This park is at the other side of the river so you can get a nice view of Seoul. It is easy to get here by taking the bus. Good spot to make some good memories, take pics and just to chill on a bench."
14,5.0,"The immense water's edge of Seoul that is the Han River is home to such a broad and varied collection of activities: cycling, swimming, water skiing, paddle boarding, canoeing, camping, bbq-ing.  You can rent bikes, camp grounds, etc.  Along its impressive length, there are water shows, water park resorts, restaurants.  It really is an impressive array."
15,5.0,"The title says just about everything - I love the Hangang park at Yeoido so much. I hung out there three nights in a row while I was in Seoul, as well as after church at the nearby megachurch (Yeoido Full Gospel Church is a 15 minute walk away - it's the largest megachurch in the world with over 1,000,000 members if you're interested in attending!). There are always tons of buskers there singing and performing, so there is entertainment. The second time I went there was also a fireworks show over the river. There's a famous sign there that says ""I Seoul U"" as well, which makes for good pics during the day and at night. When I went a couple nights ago, it was also lightly raining so everything was just beautiful. There are little stores where you can get bingsu as well, and just eat and hang out. If you want to get right to the good part of the park, take the subway and get off at Yeoinaru station. Don't make the same mistake I did and get off at Yeoido station (I thought it was closest to the church, turns out Yeoinaru is MUCH closer, and I got lost looking for it). Oh and there are also food trucks right outside the park if you're into that kind of food, and a Gong cha (my favorite boba place) next door to the church (i.e. about 15 minutes away by foot). It's a really chill place to hang out, and you can get food delivered there and drink outside and everything, it's all totally legal (and acceptable!). I highly recommend going with a friend and hanging out on the grass, or just going alone with your boba and a journal to write and be in peaceful solitude like I did! :D"
16,5.0,"I live in Seoul. But as originally from a small city in one province, I 've always missed the mother nature that can be found fully in my hometown.For me who gets tired a city life, Han river is a great soothing place. As large as enough to compare to a sea, by delivering cool winds and the location where I can glance at colorful lives of others, it comforts me a lot. In totall there are more than 20 bridges across the river, and along the river a long park stretches down, where many convenient facilities are installed, such ad like convenient stores, bicycle rental shops, toilets, ferry decks, retaurants and museums. From season to season, you can various shows and events going on. My favorite activity there is to ride a bicycle.To a traveller, I recommend to take a ferry and do bicycling, and most importantly try to eat Chi-mac(chicken and beer) like locals. It is the most popular menue for Koreans when we have casual gatherings. Feel the breeze and relax and the history of us that has lived togethet with the river and its bridges for more than a half century."
17,5.0,The river park is a quiet place that feels almost completely removed from the city. I've gone many times to relax or exercise when I feel stressed from the bustle of the crowded city. All the people I've encountered there all act totally different in the majesty of the serenity. It is a reprieve for nature folks such as myself.
18,3.0,"I was there in weekend and on a cloudy day. So many young people was there to skate, cycle, and even camping. The entire place was colourful and lively. Some food trucks and hawkers were selling mostly BBQ and noodle. But I felt it was quite boring to me (maybe I am getting old?), and a bit disappointed as I saw a lot (yes, a lot) of trash scattering around!!!"
19,5.0,"For 3,000 KRW, you can rent a comfortable bike for an hour to ride on a big bike path along the river.  The path is mostly flat, with occasional challenging hills.  It was my favorite activity in Seoul!"
20,4.0,A nice place to walk. At night/evening it is better to visit this place. I was here during noon....and one time at evening. Both was worth the trip....
21,4.0,"Hangang Park covers a vast area of land, both sides of the Han river. From Itaewon, the floating island is just a bus away. The park can also be accessed from different start points using the subway, one is via Exit5 of Express bus terminal station. I visited the park last 2015 for the sunset. I chose to walk around while waiting, but bikes can also be rented if you want to cover a much larger part of the park. It was spectacular looking the at the at the silhouettes of buildings, the bridge and Namsan tower appear as the sun sets. Unplanned, I dropped by at the park at night and I was at awe with the illumination of one of the structures on the floating island. I saw a lot of couples that night, and I can't blame them for choosing the place despite the cold. Oh so rrromantic!"
22,4.0,"This park is the site of many Hangang River attractions. Including the Banpodaegyo Bridge Moonlight Rainbow Fountain, the Underwater Bridge and Moonlight Square. During summer time, there are waters sports on the Hangang River. Perfect location for family outing. I saw kids riding bikes, flying kites, picnic & etc. Lots of outdoor activities. My favorite thing at this park definitely has to the Moonlight Rainbow Fountain. During the day, you can see the natural rainbow. At night, there is laser rainbow show. The fountain show from April to October. The rainbow jets of water stretch 1,140 meters. It creates a fantastic view over the river along with 200 colorful lights. This fountain was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as teh world's longest bridge fountain. Subway Line 3, 7 or 9, Express Bus Terminal Station, Exit 8-1]Subway Line 9, Sinbanpo Station, Exit 2"
23,5.0,"I went to this park in February and it was very cold but sunny day. Just make sure you use clothes to make you warm and you still can stroll around in this park. The day I went a few people were jogging and riding bike. you have great views of N Seoul Tower and there is a sign I SEOUL U, where you can take good pictures. There is a ferry and also a place where concerts are held but because it was winter, they were close. To arrive close to the I SEOUL U sign, take the purple subway line (number 5) and get off the station Yeouinaru exit 2"
24,5.0,"I rent a bicycle and rode a little bit over a hour by hangang river. The day was warm and sunny. I don't remember where the place was where I rode a bicycle but I hoped that there would be more places to eat something. Anyway scenery was great, bicycle was good too and I had lot of fun. Especially on sunny day you can see many korean people enjoying of their free time. You can just go and sit somewhere, maybe walk a little bit or rent a bicycle which I recommend. If you rent a bicycle I recommend to buy some snack and drink."
25,5.0,"For directions: once reached Hanum Station, turn left upon exit and head up the flight of stairs to walk right, along the expressway, until you reach the zebra crossing, get across and look to your left for the underpass to get to the other side into the park next to the river.Personal verdict: It's beautiful with the sunset over the mountains and the rainbow lights across the Hanum Bridge. Worth a visit but besides this park and river, there is really nothing much around here. Have fun travellers :)"
26,5.0,"Almost every important civilizations brought up with near water environment, and most of big cities such as NY, London, Berlin, or others are placed near water(river, whatever else)But the difference is, Han river is broad overwhelming compare with others. It's enormous scale could suggest you different kind of assessment of openness.And additional facilities near by are quite fancy and clean, convenient. Like CVS stores, public toilet with tissues, good greenfields, etc."
27,5.0,"Banpo hangang park where takes 20 min. From the bus express terminal by walking. It's the greatest places for picnic on the grass and look at the view of city. There are many activities that you can do such as flying the kites taking a walk, running, jogging, riding the bike, roller skate etc. There is the world's longest bridge fountain that you can watch the spectacular moonlight rainbow fountain show at night!"
28,4.0,"It is a nice park, but nothing too special.  It is nice to walk along the river in a park.  Just not too special of a place in my mind."
29,5.0,"If you are plan to visit Garosu gil or Apgujeong, don't miss Han river park! Garosu gil and Apgujeong are not really different with anyother spots in Seoul city.. relaxing in han river park would make your brain and body clean.. I recommand you visiting here at night time, after having some tought walks. Stair at Big river, breathe fresh air!!(oh let us just think as that way lol) take a break! You can also rent a bicycle.  I love this park so much!!압구정이나 가로수길만 가지 말고 한강공원 꼭 와보세요! 특히 저녁시간 선선할 때 지친 심신에게 회복할 시간을 가지는 것을 추천합니다"
30,2.0,"I went there in the morning hours and wasn't impressed. It's a narrow road with paths for bikes. Other than that and people running, I didn't see much more. There are also no big green areas."
31,5.0,"I had planned to go for a stroll along the river, but I didn't know what to expect. I was pleased to find myself in the middle of peace and away from the cars. True, there is ""nothing"" else to do but to walk and enjoy the view alongside with taking a break from the otherwise crowded Seoul. I walked for at least 2,5 hours and enjoyed it heavily - those who want to drive their bicycle have their rode, the ones strolling around their own. Everything is settled and really beautiful. A beautiful green space to switch off."
32,5.0,"Of all the places in Seoul, this is where I thought, I could live in this city if I came to this park every day.  Though Seoul is a big city with lots of buildings and traffic, it does have a lot of greenery and hills (I thought of Seattle or San Francisco) throughout the city that I loved. But, this park had something else (perhaps it was the proximity to water). It was a well planned and designed park for cyclists and pedestrians, there were the mini-gyms spaced out through the park, small gazebos where people were relaxing or picnicking, and lots of beautiful greenery.  It made me forget I was in a city (as long as I didn't look across the river)!"
33,5.0,"It is huge. There are 10 Hangang riverside parks in Seoul two island parks in Seoul. Among them banpo bridge and Some Sevit, Yeouidi island park is highly recommended.  :)"
34,4.0,"One of my favorite spots in Seoul, I visited the Yeouido Hangang Park once in the morning and evening. It is a great place to relax, people watch and take in the sights. Try to take the night cruise that brings you to the Rainbow Fountain show, the night views are great. I also cycled along the Han River in the evening. Great experience which I will remember for a long time to come."
35,5.0,Hangang park is a beautiful place for a walk. We went on a holiday so it was quite crowded with families and tents. Plenty of options for food and drink. Nice view of the river and city.
36,5.0,"The Hangang Park built for your relax time with your friends and family and you could rent a bike and ride along the river with the beautiful natural scenery. It's really worth to get there, believe me!"
37,5.0,"excellent for biking, hanging in the grass, relaxing, or people watching. I would often bike in the bike path in the mornings before work. friends and i celebrated easter in the grass by decorating eggs and drinking beer. celebrated a friends birthday there as well."
38,3.0,I don't really see the beauty here but it's certainly quieter and more relaxing than most of the city. If the nearby bars are threatening to stretch your budget you can buy drinks in the 7-Eleven where they have tables and chairs outside by the river.
39,4.0,"This park is really beautiful with a coffee shop near the riverside. Because of the strong wind in late autumn, I went inside and ordered a coffee. The view was so peaceful. Should visit here to enjoy the fresh air. Out of the coffee shop, there a nice park that u can walk around for sightseeing."
40,3.0,Great for a riverside walk or a biking round. Nothing stunning to see but the night lights look bright enough.
41,4.0,"if u love walking, hangang park is suitable for u. u can walk along hangang river or rent bicycle. when i was there, can see some uncle auntie (ahjushi ahjuma) exercise under road flyover. there have a space that build up with gym equipment. so people who coming there, they can fully utilize their time with exercise."
42,5.0,been here last december. it was a freezing day. i'm glad that there were less people when i went because i was able to appreciate the park in a more serene way.
43,5.0,the park built alongside the river is probably the best of its kind in the world. a visit to Seoul without a visit to the riverside promenades would be a shame. I always wonder why the city can't promote the river and the parks (in which it invested so much money) as its symbols more aggressively.
44,4.0,"came here to see rainbow bridge and it was beautiful. best time to come is in the afternoon, even though it's tend to get crowded especially in weekends."
45,4.0,"After watching this magnificent river from Running Man a few times, I guess its really as nice as watching the show. Its a great river back with stools and grassplain for people to chill out. Bicycles available for rent too! I suggest to rent a bicycle (3000 won/hour) and enjoy the river bank to the fullest! Since its autumn, Its a great experience cycling in cool windy riverbankRecommended place to go!"
46,5.0,This park stretches a long way and is definitely an excellent place to jog / exercise. Very peaceful environment and provides a great view! Definitely the place to be if you want to avoid the crowd for a little while in the morning / afternoon!
47,5.0,"If you like cycling, skating, walking or just enjoying nature a trip along the Han River would be perfect for you. You can rent a bike and enjoy a leisurely ride along the river. There is a cool breeze on most days. During the summer and on special occasions the park will be filled with people who are day camping and enjoying fireworks."
48,5.0,"The Han river is nice place to walk with beautiful view. In the morning, this place is usually very quiet and so nice to walk. But it can be a little bit noisy nearby 6~8p.m. at sakura season especially in Youido. I like this place especailly before 6p.m. I enjoy to walk or take a bicycle in this place. You can rent a bicycle in some places in this park."
49,4.0,"Lovely place post sunset ,  definitely great scenic beauty and lovely breeze - add to that the lively atmosphere of an amphitheatre with lots of families flocking that area"
50,4.0,"There are numerous Hangang Park along the Han River. You must check out Nearest Park. Personally I like Jamwon Park most, because it is less crowded than other park."
51,5.0,"I lived off this park. I attended school nearby, but lived around 30-45 minutes away when taking a car or metro; however, on days where I had to stay late, I made sure to drop by hangang park and sometimes even walk the entire 3-hour distance home by the riverside. I love rivers and parks in general, having a park by the hangang river is great."
52,5.0,"Rent a bike and go along the river, its pretty awesome!Seeing Koreans camp and enjoy the water was great site.I also got to play basketballs with some locals in the huge playground area next to the bike rental stand."
53,4.0,"Had a lovely time exploring the stretch of the river, on bicycle, from Yeouido all the way eastwards to Seoul Forest. A great way to enjoy urban nature. The area along the Han River is essentially recreational space made up of many different public parks and other facilities, ranging from benches to playing courts to fitness equipment, toilets & convenience stores  You'll need many repeat visits to enjoy the charms of the various parks dotting the riverside and exploring the 40 km stretch. Only thing is that it's not yet fully tourist friendly. I was not able to find an English map of the biking trails and other info on the facilities. I also faced difficulty getting the guy at the bicycle shop to understand and agree to my request of renting a bike along one part of the river and returning it to another station. Eventually sorted it out thanks to translation services by Tourist Hotline #1330."
54,5.0,"This is not only a great place to chill out and enjoy the scenery but also a great place to become active by renting a bike or going for a run along the riverside. There are also outdoor gym machines for a quick workout, on a nice day this is a good place to be!"
55,5.0,we are waiting for the bridge water light show around 8pm to 9pm. very beautiful and only for selected time and season.
56,5.0,"This is the place to go if there is nice weather. It's so much fun to pack a picnic and sit out on the grass enjoying the weather and people watching. From the south side of the river, you get a beautiful view of the city on the north side, with Namsan Tower popping out among the high rises."
57,5.0,"I went at night. The night light of Seoul on the other side of the river is mesmerising.There are many locals there, hanging out with friends, and it really is a good place to be after a long day of walking in Seoul."
58,4.0,"If you have spent much time in Seoul, you know it's difficult to have room to breathe and stretch your legs. As a runner, I find Seoul one of the more challenging places to run due to the traffic, the pollution, the hills and an absence of other runners. Hangang River Park is a great place to get away from it all and go for a stroll, bike ride or a run. This is especially the case on a warmer winter day (I assume it's a lot more crowded in the spring).My in laws live in Kangnam (south of the river), so I find it easiest to enter the park from the Express Bus Terminal, near the Banpo Bridge. I have run in both directions from there, west and east, for as long as I've wanted to (up to 12 miles) and in any case, have always been able to run further if I had wanted to. I encounter bikers, walkers and the rare fellow runner. The path is paved and well-maintained. As others have indicated, there are stretches where the path runs under the Olympic Expressway that are somewhat less pleasant, although on a hot day or in the rain I would welcome these stretches. The park has evolved over the years, with new bridges, landscaping and paths sprouting up every time I visit.A few suggestions:1. Watch out for ice! I have taken a few spills here on cold days. Stay away from the painted areas of the path.2. Run, bike or walk in the direction indicated. The path is generally straight but there are semi-blind turns.3. Bring your own water. As this is Seoul, there are no shortage of convenience stores. There's one near the Banpo bridge but I have always picked up a bottle in the Kangnam Undeground Shopping Center.4. You can get to the park from the Express Bus (Kosok) Terminal and walk through the Underground Shopping Center. If you look hard there are signs...exit 8-1 or 8-2 if memory serves me right.Once you are done chilling in the park you can venture back to Central City or Shinsegae and rejoin civilization!"
59,5.0,"I think this place is pretty cool just to look around and stroll about. Clears your head a lotIn the night (summer), you can find descent amount of people having a beer with their friends. Actually really wanted to join in but couldn't haha. https://plus.google.com/u/4/b/106023067131637354979/106023067131637354979/postsvisit my blog to find more places to go in Seoul"
60,3.0,"It is a huge park by the Hangang river and it has a nice walking and biking road. The remaining part of the park is usually isolated. no trees, not so much green area."
61,4.0,"I have spent many enjoyable days at this park. There are always so many people out enjoying the nice weather, having picnics, riding bikes or just strolling along the river. It's a nice way to enjoy the skyline while still feeling like you've escaped the craziness of the city for a bit."
62,4.0,The cruise is very recommended. I would say a daytime or latest dusk time is the best.I did a night time cruise which I enjoyed but there is much more to see during the day. You can also head to building 63 (nearby) after you're done.
63,5.0,"A friend took me to dinner in Hongdae and then brought me on a stroll here. Very nice walk by the river in autumn, just a stone's throw from the city. I'll consider trying water sports here next time (in warmer weather)!"
64,4.0,"If you want a quiet place with your friends or with your partner, this is one place to go. You can relax and enjoy the view. There is also a place where you can jog or ride the bicycle for those who are physically active. :)"
65,5.0,"One of the best places to enjoy snack / food / chicken & beer with your friends, sitting on mat while enjoying the view. :) About 20 minutes by bus from Sinchon / Hongdae area."
66,5.0,"This park is a very large area on the banks of the Han River.  There is so much to see there.  Like most of South Korea they have special walkways, bicycle paths etc, as well as plenty of seating just to sit and watch the world go by.  At the one end one can board a ferry that sails along the Han, and this too is well worth while to do.  There are places to eat all along the way.  It is very easy to get a cab to take you there or home again.  One just has to phone!!  A great place to visit on a clear day, in summer or winter."
67,5.0,"I am visiting family in Korea.  The Hangang (means Han River) Park is less than a five-minute walk from my brother-in-law's house.  I have been here 27 days now and use the park almost daily.  The ""Park"" is quite long (more than 15 km) along the north side of the Han River.  I like the exercise location along the walking/bike riding/roller blade areas.  The also have tennis courts, basketball courts, picnic area, camping areas, sitting areas, Nature trails, etc., along the walk.  It's very pleasant.  I've seen lots of Koreans using all facets of the park.  It's a nice get-away from the city (Seoul) which you happen to actually be in the middle of.  Very relaxing."
68,3.0,Nice to escape the city rush and walk along the walk boards through parts if this park... it feels like a place out of the city when you are actually smack bang in the middle
69,5.0,"Hangang Park is beautiful and very peaceful. They have walking and bike paths that span the river, and many areas to sit. The views of Seoul are also nice. It's a nice place to get away from the bustle of the city and to just sit back and relax! I visited the Park where there are two floating restaurants near Garosu-gil, and that was the best! They have public restrooms and there is also a 7-11 if you need snacks while there. They also have food delivery right to where you're sitting in the Park.  You definitely have to visit the Han when in Seoul!"
70,5.0,Bands and solo singers alike will come to Hongdae park to perform and you can join in the crowd and enjoy the music.
71,5.0,This is a long strech so I suggest choose a specific location. 63 building has a nice park where you can take a cruise or enjoy a bicycle or simply take a stroll. They also have j bug park and part with floating islands which until now is still closed.
72,5.0,"If u feel boring and wanna get out, u can bring mat ,pillow,beer and dont forget plastic bag and tissue, in 7-midnight, get the perfect place than sit there , i want to share my experience drink end enjoy river than sleep there ,i try thats once time, my korea. Friends suggest me sleep there, first time i just thing its a crazy thing sleep outside,especially public space,in the case in my country no ones sleep it out in public space especially a woman, but in korea is safer , i also put my ipad and mobile phone and no ones taking in, u should try is drink till sleep there and see sunrise , Amazing!!! Cool experience !!"
73,4.0,"The great thing about Hangang Park is that there are a million ways to get there because it travels throughout Seoul.  The first time I went there, I was actually wandering and had gotten lost and ended up by one of the entrances.  It's a great place for walking and exercise, as well as other activities, but my title says it all haha: the elderly in Korea are serious about their work outs!  It's quite inspiring for a young, lazy person as myself, who drives everywhere.  Anyhow, my second time here was for the annual fireworks show.  The place was packed!  I think it's necessary that everyone who goes to Seoul, go to Hangang, just because it's ""The Han."""
74,5.0,yup! when you get tired after walking so many miles.. go to hangang park! you can see around and relax.. ah! i just experienced it!
