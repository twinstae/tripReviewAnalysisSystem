3,4.0,"I like to come here to kill time and shop. You can shop, go to cafe, eat street food, and watch street entertainment, especially in the summer time or when the weather is nicer. You can see many different talents on the street, trying to make it big :). I like it, the area is a nice way to stop and watch from all the shopping and eating that you have done for the day. You can see many different performances, such as, magic show, singing, tricks, dance, and etc. Also, Hongik University is nearby, so there is a back way where you can see where all the cool kids hangout, if you are into that. You can see people rapping, singing and dancing over there."
4,3.0,"I chose this area to stay because of its vibrance, and the reviews that Trip Advisor contributors provided. The street performers I saw weren’t that good, but that’s not what attracted me to the area. The presence of a diverse set of food choices and the small pubs made it a good choice. It’s also an easy train hop to many of the local attractions."
5,4.0,"I dropped by on a Saturday night and the streets were bustling with wannabe artistes performing side by side with each other. Most of them weren’t good though, haha! But the crowd and music added to the vibrance and bustle of the area. Lots of shops and restaurants in the area so it’s a great place to stroll around and make cool discoveries."
6,5.0,"Aside from the young and hip retail stores, the sidewalks comes to live during the weekend (I was there in the early evening) with group performances by young girls and guys... singing, dancing and it was all done at pretty high standards too! Imagine K-pop MV live performance! There is a great creative vibe and lots of energy all round.  A great experience."
7,5.0,"I would rate this as better than Myeongdong, where I have stayed a few times, in that it is less touristy.  But it's packed with people and on a Saturday there was lots of amateur entertainment and dancing, a little busker festival was going on."
8,4.0,"Full of young people and subculture stuffs.If you are interested in these kind of things,I think you will love here, which is like Si-men-ting in Taiwan.這裡充斥著年輕人以及次文化。如果你對這類的東西很感興趣的話，我想你應該會蠻喜歡這邊的，這邊有點像台灣的西門町。"
9,5.0,"Especially on the weekend, this is a very lively place to shop and explore Seoul's youth culture. At night, buskers, generally young adults, come out and set up areas where they sing, play music and dance. The dancers, though, are amazing. The atmosphere is spectacular and there are so many people crowded around these performers and you can just stand there all night, absorbed in the enthusiasm and passion."
10,5.0,Grab your coffee to go or have a great meal around this Hondae street is best! Then walk around to enjoy the performances of many different buskers from singer to dancing and you can also ger yourself caricatured! Definitely a must visit!
11,4.0,"Good place to hung around... bice restaurants, shops, people, views, presents, clothes, old style and traditional... everything for a nice sunday afternoon"
12,5.0,"If you enjoy street art scenery, then this spot is for you! Hongik University (Hongdae) area is full of it from day to night. There's always a performance that you can see, from singing, dancing or even magic. And to make it even better, this location is packed with cosmetic stores, clothing stores, restaurants as well as street food stalls. The crowd is mainly youngsters and you will see many foreigners here too. So pay a visit to this place when you're in town!"
13,5.0,"Nice to stroll, see people perform on the street (singers) get a coffee or look at the shops, Raccoon cafe."
14,5.0,This area has the most interesting small shops where you can buy a very random collection of items. The place feels alive and very different to the rest of the city whatever the time of day.
15,5.0,"Did remind of Australia where street artist performed their talent along the alley. Best to visit during night. A lot of Korean teenagers filled the street to watch the artist, or just hanging around to eat and did shopping. Located quite far from the Seoul city center (around 30 mins by subway), I needed to clear my schedule to visit Hongik Univ Street.Very recommended."
16,5.0,"This place is located at Hongdae, and very accessible via Seoul’s subway through Hongik University Station. Just follow the arrows overhead, and it should tell you which exit to take. Hongik University area appeared to be one of the most popular sites to visit when in Seoul. Tourists of different nationalities are flooding the street and a Tourist Information Desk/Assistance is even readily available to assist. A lot of the shops and stores were already opened as early as noon time, while few were still closed. You may want to bring an extra shopping bag, since a lot of items for sale are very affordable."
17,5.0,"Hongik Night life alone makes this location worth checking out, but atop that there are food spots open late (Kebab, egg bread, Turkish Kebabs). Lastly, you can usually see plenty of street performances from aspiring singers, dance teams, even magicians. I genuinely miss this aspect of Seoul and I recommend you don't pass it up."
18,5.0,This area is straight up epic. The airport train comes here directly so that was a major bonus for me. Overwhelming number of things to do here and food hunts here are not very wallet friendly. For nights of fun no matter the day of the week Hongdae will keep you imensely entertained.
19,2.0,Maybe it was because its a cold winters night.. but the food was just normal shops.. as for the street 'entertainers' there was 2 youngsters singing in the street... I have seen more effort from a busker outside a London subway exit..
20,5.0,"This is with no doubt the best street in Seoul and I want to stay there when I come next time.The activities there are just amazing, people play music, sing, draw, talk and talk and talk, actually, this is the only street in Seoul where young Korean people introduced themselves and had conversations with me."
21,5.0,"At night, this is an open stage for local students and some foreigners to show off their talent.  A long walking street full of beauty shops, coffee, branded clothing, school supplies.  Don't missed those theme cafes especially Blute."
22,4.0,Lots of young people hang out here especially at night where the place will come alive with music and foods and dances. Can find reasonably priced clothing around this area as it mainly caters to the young crowd. It gets very crowded at night.
23,5.0,"It is the most trendy place in Korea. On weekends, performances by unknown singers are often held. You can enjoy the main street by subway station exit 9."
24,4.0,"Lots of fun and young people all around, street food, shows, art, music and activities everywhere. A must-visit place especially for night life lovers."
25,4.0,"The area is full of restaurants, street food and various stores for happy shoppers. It is quite nice to immerse in the youth vibe and during night time, there might be some performances on the street. I walked quite far away from the crowds to this quaint area which has a number of cafes. Would have went in for a drink if I wasn't full from my earlier meal... There is also a cute stationary store which sells stuff at cheap prices, such as notebooks, pens, envelops etc."
26,2.0,"The ""hip"" part of Seoul is anything but. It has some pricier versions of the street food I love so much in the city. The night clubs are not worth the effort. You're better off finding one of the numerous other Korean drinking areas."
27,4.0,this  shopping street has a lot of bargains to be found and a lot of people and energy. Located at Hongik university station.  Walk around and soak it up. So so many shops and stalls and coffee shops and restaurants. I enjoyed it here very much
28,4.0,"Visited this on a saturday because that's the only day where there's a free market. Everywhere you go you'll see tons of people selling either clothes and accessories or people showing off their craft whether it's singing, dancing or drawing.I had a blast playing darts though on a stall.  It was for 8000 krw and you get 8 darts. I hit all 8 and I won a blue devil plushie. So stoked because I didn't even know I was good at darts. So I recommend heading down Hongdae during Saturdays for the fun and entertainment."
29,3.0,"It is a place where Hong University students pass through as a famous spot. It is a place where young people and a place for nightlife are formed. It is also a place where foreigners visit a lot, but it is also a decadent place.유명한곳이라고 해서 찾아온 장소 홍대학생들이지나다니는거리로서 젊은이들에 마남에장소 밤문화가 형성된곳이다 외국인들이 많이찾는곳이기도하다 하지만 퇴폐스러운곳이기도하다"
30,4.0,"Great area, with lots of stuff to see, eat and do. Loads of future K-pop, b-boys and Bbongjjak superstars are practicing on the street, including the obligatory screaming teenage girls."
31,5.0,"Anytime you hit Seoul you need to be here to experience the vibrant, street performance and food. Plenty of restaurants, bars, and shops. Enjoy a good cuppa from any balcony cafes or bar to watch the street performance"

33,5.0,"If one intends to experience an upbeat vibe almost nightly, then come to Hongdae, where weekends become a festival in itself."
34,4.0,A cool little street lines with lots of great places to eat and snack foods to buy.The buskers vary in quality but it can be a small insight into the youth culture specific to Korea.Easy to waste a lot of time here.
35,5.0,"Although it's a bit far from city centre this place definitely worth a visit. You'' be a part of some art performances, you'll taste local street food, you'll meet students. And you'll just feel as if you are in college again :)"
36,5.0,"Shops open until 11, restaurants open till 4 on weekends and sometimes it's 24 hours for your KBBQ fill. The youth are everywhere. Your favorite brand name shops are here as well like Adidas, New Balance, etc. Two ABC Shoe Marts here from Japan, too, if you're into it. If you need a quiet coffee shop to get away from it, take exit 3 from Hongik Station and it should be to your left. Have fun."
37,4.0,"There are several areas in Hongik - I recommend leaving a few hours and allowing yourself to wander and get lost/get found/get lost again/get found again. This, plus Trip Advisor, is the best way to find a great place to eat, or hang out."
38,5.0,"You can always listen to an indie band, watch a K-pop girl band show or some people doing some acrobatic figures with advertising signs."
39,5.0,Needless to say there are a lot of nice coffee shops and cafe to choose from. Also good for shopping for young people. Really like it here and next time I should come here at night.

48,4.0,"Vibrant shopping street in the Hongik area full of shops, cafes and convenient stores target younger generation shoppers."
49,3.0,"Lots of young people coming here in the afternoon to the middle of the night.  Lots of restaurant but i was not sure which one is good.

52,4.0,"Come to hong dae the university town for some young bustling crowd, shopping and food ! Quite enjoy the life here but it can get overwhelming towards nightfall.

Otherwise, if you are into night life - you will love the street performers, some drinks  and more street food and vendors."
53,5.0,"Fun area with plenty of bars, restaurants and clubs. The shopping is good with plenty of vendors too. I was surprised that the coffee was so good.

56,4.0,"One of the interesting places in Seoul It is not far from the city center.Go there during the day and  at night.There are a number of shops selling clothes and shoes and other items, with displays along the street outside the shops. The prices of things seemed a bit cheaper here.At night the streets becomes more alive with impromptu performances and lots of people.Do not miss the side streets,I ran into a popup store that was selling good quality candies and cookies for 1,000- 1,500 won."

61,5.0,"Hongdae is legendary in Seoul, and for those of us who have ventured on study abroad campaigns. Two words: Alcohol and Clubs. The youth scene here in Hongdae is some of the liveliest in the world. If clubbing and alcohol aren't your forte, however, never fear! Hongdae is more than clubbing and drinking, there are ample options for shopping, eating some amazing street food or at the restaurants littered around the area. But we are here to talk about the Main Street, which every night seems to have street performers of all types, as well as famous Korean YouTubers vlogging in the streets. The whole street gives off a young, youthful ambience that can be felt by all there."
62,3.0,"Buzzing area full of artist and musicians should be here, not to mention street performances and bazaar... None was seen in the afternoon on a weekday. Perhaps i went at the wrong time on a wrong day..."

68,5.0,"This is a very nice area which felt very safe. Due to the nearby university it is a young crowd that fills the streets, parks, bars and restaurants day and night.

69,4.0,"One of the places anyone should check out especially over the wkend! Bars, shops, cafes...you name it! great vibes!"

76,5.0,"This place is a hangout for locals and tourists alike. Loads of cafes, BBQ restaurants, clothes and makeup stores, and the like. But the one thing that stood out for me was the busking and dancing that occurred at night, in the middle of the mass of shops. That is not usual, and I enjoyed seeing young talents giving their shot out in the streets for attention."

83,5.0,"Stepping out of the Hongik University station, this destination is filled with energy. If you are into the newest spots for shopping clothes, art, and other memorabilia, visit this place. I had the delight of going through its streets full of entertainers, dancers, and young artists. I was able to witness tv cameras featuring the arts scene in the district. Take home a trinket not found elsewhere, or a painting. You might be surprised how cheap some these works can be.There are a lot of restaurants catered for the youth. But mire interesting are the street food that lined its streets. Try the chciken on the streets, or yogurt and ice cream with custard. This is a trendy place as well, but not the elitist type, but more of a young and artsy type. A definite visit for the young and young at heart."
84,4.0,"This place has everything!! Cozy cafes and good restaurants, various shops and street vendors, and most importantly all kinds of art performance by young inspiring artists. I recommend to visit this street at afternoon or night as those were the times where this street is truly alive"
85,5.0,"My Korean-English friend told me that this area was where she mostly hung out on her trips to visit family in Seoul, so I had it on my must-visit list.  I actually found myself here by accident the first time since I'd come to visit a nearby cafe and then realised where I was - and it was a Saturday night which made it even better.The place was absolutely heaving with what felt like every 20-something in Seoul.  I stumbled across a mass swing dance performance and later that night saw bands and different types of dances scattered throughout.  Some were rather good!Go and get lost down the back streets.  Don't keep an eye on your map, just turn down every tiny alleyway and be astonished and delighted by what you find: a cool little cafe, an dessert parlour, a bulgogi restaurant, yet another skincare shop, hipster accessories, you name it . . .  Sure, this place is hipster and young but I'm 30 and wasn't wearing any makeup but didn't feel at all out of place.I ended up migrating back here several times during my stay in Seoul and found it just as much fun during the day, albeit easier to navigate, but always enjoyable just to wander around at night.  So long as you're happy amongst crowds of people and don't have a particular goal in mind, you'll have a great evening here, regardless of where you end up."
86,5.0,You will never get bored here as there are an infinite number of places to see and do here and you can buy stuff and watch performances too!

It's great to see the interaction between the street performers and the crowds and really love the vibe around this area!"
88,5.0,Hongdae was my favorite part of Seoul and wandering around here at night was a treat for the senses. Sadly the weather killed my only Friday night in Seoul but lots to see here at anytime. Mainly a younger crowd but really fun and accepting. Not as many tourists as Itaewon/Gangnam/Noksapyeong either so a great place to mix with Koreans.
89,5.0,"Have everything to enjoy.street food, valued local fashion,beer,pub, live show by the students. you can enjoy here all night."
90,5.0,"Do you wonder what university students do during their spare time in Seoul? Look no further than Hongik University Street. Here there are live musicians and street performers, most of which are university students from Hongik University. This little street gives you a glimpse into the lives of university students. When they aren't studying for exams, much like regular students, the students at Hongik University like to relax and hang out. Many of the students you will see on the street will be majoring in business management, but you can see that they have other ways of expressing themselves. Don't be surprised if English Major students try to strike up a conversation with you. They can tell you the best places to eat and shop, but be patient sometimes they will not be able to understand you, especially if you have a thick accent. Speak slowly and clearly."
91,5.0,this area very crowded every night. many people hangouts in here.   you can shopping or chit chat at cafe in hongik street

Clothing, cosmetics, accessories are really affordable in this shopping area. Because of the multiple universities in the area, you will see a lot of cafes...mostly full of students studying"
96,5.0,"May be i visit on Saturday,a lot of people that i can't imagine,every where is coffee shop and food restaurant,it guite expensive,i dont know why koera young  people so rich,it much better than 明洞 and other place,it is the best choice in seoul."
97,5.0,"Ummm...yeah so it's my favorite place in Seoul...I love the street performances (dancing, singing and ""magic"" acts).  I was in Seoul for only 2 weeks, but I visited Hongdae 4 times.  I also love the cheap things to buy and the street food.  I only went to 1 restaurant though and it was a chicken place (I forgot the name) but it was in a corner, the wall surrounding the door was green, the restaurant is in the basement and the other side of the street is dunkin donuts lol.  But anyways, I love this place.  I did not go to any bars or club though as I believe I've grown past that (I'm just cheap and would prefer to drink at a bbq joint lol)."
98,4.0,Well worth the visit if you are looking for something a little different in Seoul.  I came here with some local friends for some food and drinks and was pleasantly surprised.

101,4.0,"You'll have a great time just wandering the small streets near the university. Coffee shops of every imaginable type, trendy clothing stores and lots of good food. I found a tasty Japanese curry shop not too far from the station."
102,2.0,"I came there because I was promised by tourist guide a nice area with many design shops. Absolutely nothing interesting was found there, all the same things that you can find in other shopping areas. Shop assistants are extremely intrusive once they see you. Not sure if it's only because I came from Europe and they see it. They don't speak any English but still try to sell you what they think is best for you. Follow every your step, even try touching. Very discriminative and invasive behaviour. Don't recommend going there if you have been in other universities areas."
103,5.0,"Here is center of shopping ang Nightlife. Around here has a lot place to hangout and has some groups of student come out at night for show their ability. ex, sing a song or dancing."

107,4.0,"Exit Hongkit Univ stop at exit 9 and was greeted by street vendors selling local Korean food, mostly deep fried.  Then there streets are lined with stores selling clothes, iphone cases and selfies, socks and shoes Things are not expensive. The streets are wide enough so even though there are plenty of people, it is a nice stroll. There are lots of places to eat as well, from sit down restaurant food to dessert to icecream to snacks. And Korean shaved ice is my favorite. They have ice covered with oreo or fruits or the traditional with red beans. There are street performers dotting the street as well. Prepare to spend about 2 hours at least to experience the place."
108,5.0,"There's so much to do in Hongdae, from the Trick Eye and Ice Museum, lots of boutique shops, tons of cafes and restaurants, skin care shops that aren't as aggressive as Myeongdong (I prefer to shop here than Myeongdong) and lots of clubs and bars.  There's something for everyone.  There are usually food stalls outside exit 9, and maybe a couple on the main shopping street just across the info booth.  Also, it's a good place to come if you're just having a long layover as the AREX comes directly here.  So, very easy to get to and from the airport."
109,5.0,"Walk around this university district if you want to see performers, buy some cool Seoul-specific nick nacks, or have some good street food. Very accessible by metro and close to lots of shops as well."

112,4.0,"I remember Hongdae back in 1994, when it was an artsy but not so popular place. It was popular after midnight because many places stayed opened illegally given the midnight curfew at the time. Hongdae has grown gigantic over the years but most of the businesses are the same -- coffee shops, clubs, bars and clothing boutiques. There are a few places still there, and they have LP bars that have attracted a following (i.e., Suzy Q) but I say this place has lost a lot of character."

114,4.0,"The hostel where I stayed was very close to Hongik University street and it was great, cuz its a good place to take a walk at night. There is loads of stores and restaurants, and you can also see nice music performances along the street."
115,3.0,"I was staying around the area and got to visit it a couple of times. Be sure to drop by towards noon on a Saturday morning for the Hongdae Free Market as you will get stalls selling (mostly) Korean self-made products, which comprise various trinklets and artsy-related items that you may not see in other markets around Seoul. Most of the clothing shops in Hongik University also open after 11am so anytime after 11am would be a good time to dvisit. There are also a number of cafes worth visting. I didn't drop the Hello Kitty cafe a visit but it's unmistakable in bright pink (although it is hidden in an alley, off the main street) but I did drop by Thanks Nature cafes and both sheep were around (Anna and Else). It's an interesting experience nonetheless to enjoy some toast and coffee with the sheep."

117,4.0,"Love this place revisited again this time in seoul. It's pleasant shopping experience, more relax than Myeodong which I find Myeodong becoming much more commercialize than many yrs back.Think best go in wkend heard there is flea market but miss it. But surprise to see that some clothes are more expensive than gangdam underground shopping area, which I thot university area clothes should be cheaper."

123,5.0,"you will find a lots of shops ranging from clothing, sunglasses, food, skincare, and restaurants are in Hongdae. beware that they start their day quite late as they open until early morning everyday. Hongdae area is where you go after 12 pm for some coffeehopping, a bit of shopping, chicken & beer, korean bbq and clubbing."
124,3.0,"Hongdae Streets are like Soho in New York.. or it used to be. Back when Hongdae was authentic where indie musicians and artists came to do things... it wasn't crowded at all. In early 2000s saw beginning of club culture in Hongdae where youngsters started to come for a night out during weekends. With huge surge of cafe culture in Korea in mid 2000s, some unique cafes and restaurant also opened up in this area, and it's been the it place for hipsters of Seoul since then. But as with every area that becomes 'hip', Hongdae in recent years saw infusion of big commercial companies... pushing out independent artists and shops that made Hongdae cool in the first place. Now most of the area is occupied by designer brand shops and commercial places that have illusions of hip, but is nothing but money driven commercial market places. But it is no denying that Hongdae still is the most 'happening' place in Seoul for youngsters, where most popular concerts are still held, and its weekend flea market is still the best in the city despite the fact there being so many similar ones all around. It is looking more and more like Itaewon these days, but it is worth a visit, and if you stay in Seoul long enough, it's unavoidable that you visit at least once. But to sample what Hongdage really used to be, head down to Yeonamdong, which is not far from Hongdae and is being dubbed as next hipsters' haven."

I was traveling solo so I skipped these. I found one which was more to my liking. Staff was great and they played all my western pop requests!"
141,4.0,"While Hongdae is known for its youth culture (it’s located near Hongik University), and features many bars and restaurants, you don’t have to be young to have a great time here. I’m certainly no college student but that didn't stop me from enjoying a truly authentic Korean experience. First, I had dinner at a Korean restaurant where you cook your own food at your table. As an American, this was something I wasn't used to but I definitely enjoyed it. It gave me a true “taste” of the Korean food culture. Second, even though I’m not a big drinker, I spent a good part of the night going to different bars and drinking the national Korean drink, Soju, which has a very high alcohol content. Let’s just say that I've never been so drunk in my life-it knocked me on my butt! Whenever you visit a foreign country, you want to experience the culture of that country and by going to Hongdae, I felt that I accomplished this."
142,5.0,"You can find many shops, restraurants and clubs there.  And in the evening,  you can easily be attracted to the busy streets. A 3D gallary is nearby, you can have fun with friends there."
143,5.0,"it was an interesting trip to get around this place. its difficult if you didnt have much of a purpose or objective to go around and walk. so if you are like me, good luck with that. but it was nice to see a university-feel to it, and the fashion sense was a little different, its for sure a good place to check out more if you live there as a local."
144,5.0,"Lovely experience. Do visit on a Saturday when the flea market is held at the playground area. If I recall correctly, it ends at 6pm but dont leave early as in the evening, you will have the opportunity to be entertained by various groups of young people singing, dancing etc around the area. Really great to see that they are allowed to perform freely. Some great talents!"
