4,5.0,Look very good to your direction.So if you stand ready to get in the train.Look you will see above you were you are. A arrow will point were you are going....check on you map.

5,4.0,"Used the metro in rush hour. Although busy it was still the fastest way to get around the city, cab would have taken over an hour in traffic. The metro was clean and had aircon, also very easy to use."
6,4.0,You can travel with min of 1320 won . Single or multiple travel cards are available. T MONEY  cards are easily available
7,3.0,"Don't get it wrong, it is a great service that connects the whole city, but it is awfully confusing, lots of lines, signs are confusing as well as the lack of directions. It is better to use Google maps because you might get lost and annoyed if only you use the sign in the stations. Tho confusing, it is neat and polite. Pretty safe I must add. Good option but not to be used a lot if you're staying for short periods of time."
8,4.0,Seoul Subway is one of the most convenient ways to travel in the city. The network is very extensive. There should be more signages in English.
9,5.0,"I used the metro quite often as it is cheap, very clean and frequent. There are signs in Korean and English and announcements telling you the name of the next station and is easy to use."
10,5.0,"I even worry when earthquake occurs, the whole Seoul city would be sink to the ground. even you can go near cities by metro."
11,4.0,The system is well organized and bilingual.  It works with colors with each route having it's own color. Trains are modern and clean. Sub terraenean stations are packed with shops and the Gangnam station is a city in itself. It is also cheap. Within Seoul a ticket will run 0.5$ to 3.00$ and going an hour south about 4.00$
12,5.0,"Ticket machines, stops and lines all written in English. Trains have air con and are very roomy. The Koreans are VERY civilised and line up in single file to get on."
13,5.0,Looking at the whole subway map is quite confusing. I literally got lost after alighting the express train from the airport. It took a while for me to be familiar with the exits and transfer but after that taking the seoul metro was a breeze. Try to download the subway app to help you navigate the lines.
14,4.0,"If you take time to learn the payment system and how to read the station maps, you are all set for a great time traveling in Seoul. Some trains and station are a bit older but still efficient."

16,5.0,"Quick, convenient, clean and cheap. Reliable transportation without traffic delays.   It is a great option."
17,3.0,"The Seoul Metro station is amongst the most complex metro/train stations I have travelled on. The Seoul metro station itself has over 20 exits, so unless you are very clear on which exit you need to take, it can get very confusing and you can land up in a place very far from where you want to be. So tip#1, when getting off at Seoul metro station, be very clear which exit you need to take. If not sure, ask around.The 2nd challenge is that the ticket vending machines dont accept cash or credit card.  You need to have a travel card which is a prepaid card. So as a tourist you kind of get stuck trying to buy a ticket."
18,5.0,"Clean, with a really wide network which can even take you out in great lanscapes among mountains for instance, the metro in Séoul is also very easy to use.First use your credit card to buy a T card, for a cheap price (as in London, for instance) : go to the machines in the station (and select the langage : English); then indicate the amount you want to deposit (a simple trip is about 1500 KTW). Everytime you will enter a metro station, your card will be checked for the credit and will register where you entered. The corresponding amount will be debited as getting out, according to the length of your trip.The card may also be used in City busses.On the platform, the lines are indicated by their number and colour, but also by their last station. But you also have the name of the NEXT station the metro is coming from and going to :for instance on the platform of City Hall, you will see  ""Jonggak –> City Hall –> Seoul"" Station.In each car, you have a screen AND an announce of the next station, which is repeated in English : and the pronounciation of the name of the station in Korean does correspond quite well to what an Eurpean would naturally pronounce when he reads the European version (which would't be the case in Chinese, for instance).The pictograms have been well designed, and are quite easy to understand.When you get out for a transfer, please beware of the numbers and do not mistake the number of the line you want to transfer to with the number of the exit (the exit are usually indicated on yellow). To avoid that mistake and also make a swift transfer (rush hour can be really busy), the indications ""transfer to"" are sometines indicated on the ground, with a line you can follow : for instance, transfer to a green line will appear with a green ""tread"" of tiles on the ground platform (in Busan for instance).But if you are used to more ancient (and historical) metro, as in Paris or Budapest, remember that the distance between 2 stations is longer, and stations can spread on a wide area : you will have to walk more to enter, exit or transfer. In the oldest station, you do not always have an escalator : if you have luggage, better to look for the elevator, but you probably will have to get in line for it, so be sure not to be in a hurry."
19,3.0,It was great experience travelling by Seoul Metro. It is a very good transport mode to travel across the city. Download the metro app which will help you find the route. If you are confused for anything ask from fellow travelers. They are always more than willing to help you find right route.

21,5.0,"Clean, spacious, reliable, SAFE, super efficient, brings you everywhere, anouncements in 4 languages, absolutely fool proof. Your fellow travellers will be clean and nice to look at. They all look at their smart phones, you remain invisible to them. Only the seniors will push you aside to reach their reserved seats, you are not supposed to compete for them unless you are yourself visibly a senior."
22,4.0,"Whilst on business in Seoul, I have used the local Metro to get around the City and recommend it.Ticket machines have an English option. Single tickets are available, just make sure you get the 500 Won refund from the separate machines at the end of your journey."
23,5.0,"Went from airport to my hotel in an 1.5 hr. Traffic can be terrible in Seoul. The metro was easy to get at airport, had English for buying ticket, clean, very save, easy to change lines as I had to do. As easy as the T in Boston or MTR in HK or MRT in Singapore."
24,5.0,"The Seoul Metro is a great example of an efficient modern subway system. The trains usually run on time and it's easy to navigate your way around the system. The tricky bit is knowing where to obtain a travel card and how to load them. Once you manage that, you'll be fine"
25,5.0,"Very good coverage of Seoul, well integrated with other modes such as buses and regional rail and high speed train.

27,4.0,The subway was convenient. There are a lot of English signs. They often had escalators that would go up a flight or two then stop leaving everyone to walk up stairs. It was not easily to get around with mobility issues. Some of the stations were pretty.
28,5.0,"Easy to go, but must avoid peak hours, Price is reasonable and most important is free from traffic jam in Seoul. Recommand you to buy the T-money great and small piece of devices,working like a card,easy to be charged, its cheaper if you go around Seoul while using it, the best thing was that i use it with multiple functions, you can use it in the bus,taxi,subway and metro."
29,4.0,The metro works fine but takes a little time to figure out. Much of it is labeled in English so it is better than other metros like Shanghai or Tokyo.
30,4.0,"Based on some of the reviews I read, I was expecting this place to be very difficult to navigate, since I don't speak any Korean.  Not so.  Easy to buy a metro card or ticket.  T-money is easier and more useful.  English speaking vending machines in the stations.  I haven't found one that takes a credit card, though.  Google maps works pretty good, navigating the metro system.  Cheap!  Cheaper than the trains in Tokyo, but they don't seem as fast."
31,5.0,It’s simple. Get a Tcard and use the Seoul metro and busses. You will get wherever you need to go cheaply and quickly. Would use again and would recommend to friends.
32,3.0,Could be challenging without fluent korean The trains themselves are clean efficient and reasonably priced. Train stations are also confusing as far as exits are concerned. You may end up on the wrong side of the street unless you have precise instructions from a local resident.

37,5.0,"The Seoul Metro is one of the best I have ever seen.  Super clean, well organized, easy to follow and ride and here is a tip:  people do not talk on the train.  So if you need to communicate - whisper!"

41,4.0,"The Seoul Metro is a very nice, convenient and inexpensive way to get essentially anywhere in Seoul; as a native english speaker I found it very easy to navigate and have used it heavily during the several trips I have made to Seoul through the years.  The cars are wide and the seats are comfortable, if you can get one (but don't count on it!).  I don;t know if I would say it is the top attraction in the city, but it is a great way to get to just about anyplace in the city you'd like to go."
42,4.0,perfect alternative to the taxi on crowded roads. So take your time and enjoy an easy travel through Seoul
43,4.0,"Quite simple to use along with naver maps and i tried using single destination tickets and as others have mentioned here, it might be better to use the T money card."
44,5.0,"The South Korean Public Transportation system is by far one of the best in the world. -On Time-Efficient-CheapEven if you are a foreigner coming from a developing nation, the public transport prices are highly affordable. The downside is that SOME stations are not mentioned in English. You would need to download Naver-for iOS and Android (the South Korean version of Google Maps) to get around as Google Maps does not work everywhere and when it does it shows only information about public transport but not the walking and driving routes. There is an alternate app for foreigners called CityMapper but it's not very accurate. I've seen most tourists (not foreigners- foreigners settled in SK use Naver) use City mapper because it can be used in other countries as well and also because most places are mentioned in English. I've used CityMapper most of the time as it's interface is very easy to navigate and understand. But it's not very accurate. My Korean friends do not recommend City Mapper. So in my 1 month stay in Korea, it was towards the last week that I was more comfortable with Naver.If you want to save a ton of money, use the Metro & Bus. You'll save a lot of money which you can use for Shopping and food."
45,5.0,As a foreign traveller you will find the metro easy to navigate. Just remember that you will need to get cash from an ATM before acquiring a ticket as the machine only take cash for the Metro at the Airport.
46,5.0,"Best way to get around Seoul and avoid the traffic.  very well connected, just remember to download the map before making a trip.  Getting a prepaid card is the easier way to travel and avoid buying single travel tickets on every trip."
47,5.0,"Initially it is daunting to use the metro as it is so huge and complex but every line is colored and every stop is numbered and actually it is extremely logical. There are really clear signs for the different numbered exits for each station and clear signs indicating where to find restrooms. It gets exceptionally crowded on some lines -- but people line up in a very organized manner. However, people pack in like sardines. On the other hand, I felt safe even in the crowded carriage."
48,5.0,"The electronic Tablo in railway carriage is very comfortable, you can see where you are now and how many stops are left to your station."
49,5.0,Might be tricky at first finding the route and stations. Download the app. Clean efficient and always timely
50,5.0,"While you are in Seoul, the metro is a great  idea to travel with. Easy to go around comfortable and fast to travel."

53,2.0,Public transport use in Seoul is not the easiest and very few speak English. Stations also seems to be some distance to walk from most tourist locations and/or hotels.Rather use Uber if you not wanting to walk long distances
54,4.0,"We paid extra money for the “visitor or tourist T money card”. Absolutely no difference between this tourist card or the cheaper local T money card. It shows that there are “benefits” for using this tourist T money card if you show it at certain stores and restaurants...etc. But when we showed this tourist card to the cooperating businesses, they had no idea what benefit this card offers and kept telling us that it’s only used for transportation. For example, at the Hyundai department store, it says some discounts may be provided along with a free drink. But when we asked the customer service at Hyundai department store, the staff had no clue and said we had to go back to the specific store to enquire about benefits. An important note is that you can’t return and refund for the card itself and a 500won incurs if you try to refund the remaining amount in your card."
55,4.0,The Seoul Metro is effortlessly accessible.Tickets are cash onlyPhone apps mandatory to assist navigating for non Koreans

61,4.0,"Subway is the way to go as traffic can be a problem and something that you could do in 20 to 30 minutes by subway can take an hour by car.You can buy one way tickets, which will charge you 500 won ($0.50) deposit.  You can get it back at machines when you get where you want to go.Alternatively, you can just tap as you enter and exit with your credit card.I suggest you download an App for the Seoul Subway that has a route planner."

All most all the place in Seoul could be reached by Metro at the price of less than 2 US dollar."

67,5.0,"Clean, efficient, air conditioned.  Very easy to use (though you might need glasses for the small maps!).  You need to buy a card before charging it - these are sold at small grocery shops which are located near the metro."
68,5.0,I needed to change airports in Seoul to travel within the country. Signs for the train were clear (even for foreigners!). I so appreciated this. The train itself was clean and on-time. I wish every major city in the world had something as well maintained and operated as this!
69,4.0,"The only problem is that I cannot read in Korean language, but with the map provide by the hotel I was able to travel without any problem."
70,5.0,Seoul has one of the most comfortable subway systems I have ever seen. Tickets are easy to purchase and directions are described clearly so you can get to your target station.
71,5.0,"Safe, inexpensive, easy to navigate and a must for transiting Seoul and the surrounding areas. The entire infrastructure looks new, the trains/subway cars are modern and among the best I have used domestically (in the U.S.) and internationally.

73,5.0,Huge metro system which can basically take you anywhere...trains were clean and spacious (on a Saturday)...
74,5.0,"NYC and Paris should hang their heads in shame. Clean bright carriages, clear announcements in the train including which side the platform will be on, clear labeling in stations including stating the next stop of the arriving train (so you don't have to follow the map to the final destination like ""direction""s in Paris). Also exit signs leading to clearly numbered station exits, and you can see the exit layout on GMaps to figure out the best way to go wherever you are going."
75,5.0,It is a little complicated net of connections but there are many visual guides around to help. People are very supporting and always help to buy correct ticket to your destination. There are often many levels on station so on beginning you should check were the train is going ;)Stations are very nice and clean. The best option to move in Seoul.
76,5.0,Seoul subway metro rail is one of the most clean and efficient metro trains I've travelled by. There are ten lines and inter-connectivity is good. Stations are well maintained and the underground shopping is nice too.
77,5.0,"If you travel around different places and countries and you need to save some money for other expenses yes this subway is the right decision because-is very easy to ride it , the price is cheap and you can take all your luggage without any problem, there are information in caracteres and English too, is clean and most of the stations have elevators and electrical stairs, you can buy easily your transportation card, the sights are very easy to understand"

79,5.0,"Greater Seoul sprawls to Incheon airport and houses about half of the country population (50 million). Yet Seoul’s comprehensive metro system with express trains on some of the lines (including line 9 that goes to Gimpo airport) makes it easy to get from A to B. Seoul metro is also cheap (standard fare is approx. 1 euro per journey (1250 KRW) + small supplements for extra distance). You need to buy a travel card from a machine - only cash. If you still have money left on your card, you can get it back - together with the cost of the card - by sticking the card in another machine. Trains are less frequent at week ends. Station names feature in Korean (Hangeul) and English. All stations are announced in 4 languages (Korean, Japanese, Chinese and English), so you need to be attentive. Finding the right exit might be trickier. Korean people are very helpful with lost tourists,so you can always expect someone will come to the rescue. Avoid rush hours, especially on line 3, because then the law of the jungle will apply."
80,5.0,"I’ve taken the Seoul metro many time and found it to be very convenient and easy to navigate to anywhere you need to go, even when traveling by yourself. If you have an iPhone, you can down load a free app that is easy to follow."
81,5.0,you can go any where in Seoul without any trouble with metro! You can also transfer to buses with a very small amount of charge! 서울은 전세계 어디에서도 볼 수없는 최고의 교통시스템을 갖추고 있습니다! 지하철과 버스 요금을 한번만 내면 30분이내 자유롭게 환승을 무료로 할 수 있습니다.

83,5.0,Wow its truly amazing nothing can be better than this expirince worth all the money spent efficient to the fire
84,4.0,"Signs are clearly marked in English and all announcements are made in Korean, Japanese, Chinese and English.If you get lost, there is something wrong with you."
85,4.0,One of the best metros in world. Really amazing experience & fun especially during rains. Will love to visit again.
86,5.0,"Inexpensive, comfortable and faster than a car. Depot area well marked and easy to navigate. Recommended."
87,3.0,"big subway system. for a best experience, I recommend Kakao Metro app  (also has Busan subway map and other cities)"
88,5.0,Get a reloadable card (instead of single use ticket which will cost you more). It is a lot more convenient. Get to learn the subway lines and transfer points. It is easy to get around.Don't forget to return your single use ticket to the kiosk to get your 500 won deposit back.
89,5.0,"It's extensive, and if you need to go somewhere, you can get there, if you have enough patience. Sometimes crowded, but that's to be expected."
90,4.0,"Even though most signs are in Korean, but all important and necessary informations are in English.Very systematic.Very clean and well maintained.Many different metro lines were interlinked excellently. Only flaw, frequency of trains should be higher."
91,5.0,The Korean Metro is very convenient and low cost.  The train displays all stops in Korean and English and it’s very easy to navigate the city on clean and air conditioned train cars.
92,4.0,"I took the nine line to Gimpo from Gangham area and then transferred to the sky line to ICN.  It was inexpensive - about 5 USD.  The cars were really crowded on the nine line for a while, so it was a bit of a haul but still worth saving so much compared to a taxi that be in traffic.  I think it took 1:20 end to end to get to ICN."
93,4.0,"It is clean everywhere, but the signage is not that clear if you go there for the first time. Recommend you to install kakao metro app where you will get a very clear direction. I attach the kakao metro screenshot."
94,5.0,"Easy to navigate but it gets very very crowded during rush hour, so you might want to plan your travelling at times other than rush hour."
95,5.0,just grab a t money card and you are good to go. didn't experience the peak hour rush but apparently it is cozy
96,4.0,"This was by far the best way to get around town. I bought a “t-money” card at the subway kiosk (they have them at each station) that I loaded with about $10 USD which was good for travel all day for about 3 days. I ended up needing to reload the card one more time that week for another $5. I used Kakao Metro app to tell me which subway to use and it was especially helpful to know which exit to get out of. Since some of the stations are so large, it was nice to get out as close to my destination as possible. Try to avoid rush hour as it gets very crowded, particularly on the green line."
97,4.0,"Fast and very convenient, with indications in both English and Korean. Avoid rush hours if possible! Lots of info offered to help travellers, just need to take the time to check the maps and signs. Info desks at main stations with friendly staff eager to help."
98,5.0,"After downloading the “Kakao Metro” app, I found it easy to use, with announcements and indications in English and Chinese. Convenient and cheap both for business and shopping. Can be crowded at rush hour but beats being stuck in trafic in a taxi"
99,5.0,"Easy, quick, clean, and for me really nice. You can see all sort of faces, and all those faces are always smiling. If you make eye contact with any other passenger no matter if it is male or female, you will always get a worm smile. It has nothing to do with metro, but it is nice."
100,4.0,"Takes a little while to get used to the ticket machines and the directions, but once you do it is the easiest and cheapest way to travel around Seoul"
101,5.0,"Seoul metro is IMO one of the better. Easy to navigate, quite cheap. A lot faster than TAXI especially in rush hours. But can be also very crowded."
102,5.0,"We lived in Seoul for a decade and a half over three different periods, and have witnessed the growth of this system.  The T-money system is wonderful, and one can even use the card in taxis and convenience stores.Plus, this system connects to Incheon airport, and unless one has a crying need to get to Seoul station, using the other express and regular lines can get one to lots of different places.  And the system, in conjunction with the Korail system can get one pretty far south in Gyeonggi province."
103,5.0,"I used to live in Korea in the 1980s and returning in 2018 is a shock (in a good way).  The new system rivals Tokyo's or Berlin's in terms of convenience and punctuality.   Well done,  Seoul!"
104,5.0,Was a pleasure to ride the metro in Seoul. Everything was on time. Clean and tidy stations and trains and well behaved passengers.
105,5.0,I like the seoul metro service. The time it took and expected time checking in the metro app is exact. I was so impressed.
106,5.0,"If you need to get somewhere then metro it is. This lovely system will connect you to even the darkest reaches of Seoul, sometimes inadvertently . Hard to tell which station you're at sometimes but what's more immersive than having to ask a Korean person who speaks no English what the next stop is? Step out of that comfort zone and get your annyeong haseyo on."
107,4.0,"Overall clean, efficient and modelled on the Tokyo subway system. Please don’t forget to retrieve your deposit on the plastic tickets - simple enough to do. My only issue is that it can take a long time to get to some places (45 minutes for a 12Km journey) as the river splits the network. Enjoy the sleeping locals..."
108,5.0,Inexpensive and easy to use even if you don't read and write Korean.  Don't even need cabs. We visited amusement parks and other attractions without any problems.
109,5.0,"And I say this having been around to many cities and ridden many subways. This subway is impeccably clean and remarkably efficient.Despite 60 million people, it’s not crowded. And it’s light on the pockets compared to a taxi.Big thumbs up!"
110,4.0,"I think the underground in Seoul, South Korea is easy to understand because it supports 3 or 4 kinds of announcements,different colors and there are unique number on its station. You don't need to pay extra money when you change lane but a little far and confusing direction mark makes you opposite direction..but it's better than the japanese underground which is like a web, I gave it up to understand...:)"
111,5.0,"Excellent system, clean and safe!  Great and inexpensive way to travel.  If you have used s metro system anywhere - DC, NYC or London then you got this"
112,5.0,"Very easy to follow/understand transit system, despite the very confusing station names! I regularly use the metro/subways in New York and Tokyo and this by far was the easist to use!"
113,4.0,"The metro network is the way to explore Seoul. If you stay only few days and plan less than 5-6 rides per day, buying single trip tickets is easier than buying a rechargeable card. 500 W deposit on single fare cards will be immediately returned after the ride. Caution: you need cash for the vending machines (that can be switched to English language). Single fare tickets can also be used when transferring between lines. Metro is much faster and more easy to pay&use than buses. In peak times be prepared however that the trains are really crowded."
114,5.0,"Great subway and easily the cleanest I've seen in a long time. Respectful passengers (most on cell phones), and regular schedule so wait times were not long. Well-connected underground shopping, too. Best choice for getting to all major sites in Seoul."
115,4.0,"Get a T money card it will be more convenient and you will get cheaper fares to ride the metro/subway. If you buy single trip ticket, it will cost around KRW 1450, but with subway card/T money KRW 1250 (depending on the destination) and you don’t have to buy tickets at the vending machine all the time. It will be cheaper to do this rather than taking a taxi (with all the traffic jam and bad driving of the driver). It’s quite simple to learn the Seoul subway. But notice that most station has plenty of exits, so check out which exit is the nearest to your destination. And plenty of stations don’t have escalators and only stairs and elevators (but prioritized for elderly, disabled people, pregnant women, people with baby strollers and with luggages)."
116,4.0,We only used it once but it seemed to be relatively easy to get around town. We went from Korean Fish Market back to our Oakwood at Coex Center and it took us less than half the time as a taxi.
117,4.0,"I found this easy to use but you will need to persevere until you understand it!The ticket machines do work in English and you can buy one-off tickets if you're only doing a few journeys.  It is really cheap and pretty logical.  As with most metros: know where you are going and the route you're taking, including the end stations on the lines you're using; buy the ticket; jump on.  The stations are signed in English (or follow the line and direction - this can involve a long walk BTW).  The cars also have signs showing the next stop in English.I just wouldn't try to learn this during rush hour."
118,4.0,The metro is rather cheap and good to get around. Especially as there is lots of traffic in the city.
119,4.0,"The Metro is by far the quickest method of travelling in and around the capital, but there are several lines, and the tourist might find it a little complicated as little is written in English.  It is efficient, speedy, but overground buses might be easier to find your way around."
120,2.0,"The vast majority of Koreans that use the Seoul Metro use T-Money cards or similar for accessing the trains. But visitors without a T-Money card are at the mercy of the ticket machines at the stations. And it is very clear very quick that they are not frequently used. My first experience was an attempt to buy a T-Money card using the vending machine at the station. I followed the prompts (in English) and did everything I was supposed to do and it didn’t dispense a card. I tried cancelling the transaction and no luck. I tried pressing the help button, but no one answered and no one came.With no other option, I went to the single ticket vending machine. I selected the station I was going to and while I was putting money into the machine it timed out and cancelled the transaction. Fortunately it did return my money, but it took me trying multiple times at that machine and two times at a different machine before I got a ticket. I explained this to the local team I was working with and they agreed to come down and help me, obviously suspecting user error. It took us three attempts to get a ticket. The machine wouldn’t accept my bill, so my coworker got out their bills and it wouldn’t accept them either. We tried 2 more machines before it finally took the money and gave me a ticket.Over the length of my trip I used the metro 5 times and was never able to get a ticket to dispense the first or second try. What a complete mess.As for the trains themselves, they are clean and relatively modern. Realize if you hit the metro during rush hour, you will be herded into the car and squeezed in until there is no possible way to get anyone else into the car.In the end, it is a very convenient system obviously not designed for visitors. Unless you are comfortable with frustration, taxis Amy be a better alternative for the traveler."
121,5.0,"As in all things Asian, Korean, the height of efficiency. Even for a tourist the system is easy, no language skills necessary.Fast, always on time, clean."
122,3.0,"Crowded, many people. Small chance to get a seat. Mostly standing up all the way. Quite convenient, a bit confusing with Korean alphabet and language. But manageable. Easiest transportation and organized."
123,5.0,Never missed out on my appointments as the trains were absolutely running smoothly.Not as crowded compared to Tokyo.
124,4.0,"Travelling with the metro in Seoul is a very special experience. Allthough it is a +20 million city travelling is not such a problem as you should expect, mainly because of the discipline of the local populateion and the many metro officers who will help a smooth operation. And by the way, free wifi is for free in all stations!"
125,5.0,"Seoul Metro arguably is the best subway system in the world. It continues to expand with 9 separate lines that covers around 180 miles in total length. The trains are newer and bigger that the ones in NY, London and Paris. Unlike Tokyo metro which has signs in Japanese only, Seoul metro provides English as a major foreign language with Chinese and Japanese signs as well. All the trains have good HVAC system, with excellent station information so that visitors can clearly understand where to disembark. The stations are equipped with glass wall/door to prevent from passengers falling to the tracks accidentally and to block all the headwind and dust as the train approaches the track. I thought that was a marvelous design and thought. The fare is very reasonable at $1.2 for basic one way charge. There are certain lines that connects to Gimpo airport and from Gimpo airport station, one can get on aboard a train to Incheon airport. From Seoul Yeok station, one can transfer to KTX  bullet trains or from Suseo station, one can transfer to SRT bullet trains. One has tk purchase separate ticket for the bullet trains."
126,4.0,"Buy a card for 3,000 won at the vending machine and then top it up as one does with a London Oyster card. The trains were clean, on time and regular. Get a map as each line is colour coded. I found it really easy to get around. The Koreans were very helpful which was good as there isn't a strong presence of metro staff for those rare times of confusion."
127,5.0,"The Seoul Metro system is one of the best I have used around the world - and I've been to many big cities! The lines are color coded and the colors are shown on platforms, too. When you need to change lines, simply follow the color of the next line you need at the interchange station and it will take you directly to the platform for the next line. It's so easy to use, you don't even need to speak or read Korean."
128,5.0,Used Seoul Metro a lot during a one week business trip. Very easy to use for English speaking traveler. Locals are very helpful to foreign travelers.
129,4.0,"I took the subway multiple times during my 2 weeks stay in Seoul. It is very clean. If you travel a lot I recommend to buy a subway card , available in the mini markets in the hall, which you can reload at every station. If you only buy one way tickets keep in mind that there is a deposit on those cards so you can get a refund if you return them."
130,5.0,"Seoul has 10 million people living there, the government took very good care for Metro Seoul to offer best service, connections are huge, I believe over 16 lines are moving across the city , it's very clean and very good prices, with less than two dollars (KRW1500) you can move between stations, even once you leave you can return the card and get back (KRW500), I moved from a station near by Grand Hilton to  Bukchon Hanok Village, very easy, and also moved to Eta1 station, as well it was comfortable.Really I advice all travelers to Seoul to use the Metro, it's really easy."
131,5.0,"Great for me during congress in Gangnam-gu Sep17. Easy to use, clean, once you work out system (easy) it is great"
132,5.0,Very clean decks and cabinesA lot of information desk officersClear signs and state of the art Metro
133,5.0,I always feel safe traveling via subway in Seoul and very easy to navigate to pretty much all of Seoul. Also very clean!
134,5.0,Friendly travel by metro...Cover almost all places in seoul...Safe journey... less crowded... Good experience
135,4.0,"Not much to say, cheapest way to get around. You get a refund if you return the metro card you buy at the end of your trip."
136,5.0,Efficiency is the key to why I always take this metro wherever I go. Very convenient and easy to understand directions.
137,3.0,"Good and efficient. Very on time and fast. Used it extensively going from Coex to Myeongdong, Namdaemn, Naryangin fish market, Seoul station, Dongdaemun toys street, Insadong ... But going through Express Bus Terminal station is a pain - full of people, hard to board and hard to exit the train during the peak hours. Once even nearly could not exit. Nobody was willing to even budge half an inch - some even push you back!"
138,5.0,"The Seoul subway is the best one I have ever taken in my life.It's so convenient, peaceful and calm. People are actually very polite on the subway. You can't scream, it's forbidden. (and i totally enjoy it)The subway is always on time! It's incredible!"
139,5.0,"I am not sure whether what we travelled by were long distance KR Trains or Metro, but we had gone from Seoul to Yeous and back in the fast railways. The experience was amazing. From the very neat and clean railway station to trains and its toilets, with disposable seat covers, it was a treat to travel in it. The seating and coaches were more roomy and comfortable than economy class tickets of normal planes. The speed was up to 325 KMs/Hour and scenery outside were so pleasing to eyes. All the stations were like a mall and full of amenities and facilities. Overall, I find them a much better trains than in India or China and even France. Thumbs up."
140,4.0,The metro is really well managed and run . The volume of people takes a bit of getting used to and getting pushed about but that as all part of the fun of travel . The place is designed also as a neuclear shelter just in case Kim fat ung decides he wants to chuck a few devices down south . Trains were clean and model and experienced no delays and the staff were friendly and helpful not like the London Underground .
141,4.0,"Metro is crucial to getting around town and avoiding traffic. But make sure you have a local friend to help you get the pass, and to know how to get around!"
142,5.0,"What a humane travel experience! The system has 11+ lines covering the city and suburbs. It is air conditioned, including some of the waiting areas. Cars are spacious and some have flat screen entertainment en route. The system does take a bit of getting accustomed to. Trains are long and a station may have a dozen exits/entrances. The traveler needs to know which exit is most convenient at the destination. Toilets are in most of the stations and are free and clean. I always paid 1,350 or 1,450 Korean won. That's $1.20 to $1.28 per ride (plus a 500 won returnable fare card). A bargain by any standard."
143,5.0,"The metro really covers the city well, is quite affordable and there are just enough announcements and signage in English to allow a non-Korean English speaker to navigate the system.  Trains are clean and frequent.  The only downside  was that the system shuts down really early, like at midnight or something like that. So if you're out late, you may have to take a cab."
144,5.0,"Very easy to navigate. Cheap way to get around Seoul. For tourist, I recommend to buy yourself a T Money Pass. You can use for all subways, buses and even taxis. Reloading more money to your card is very convenient and simple. They are color coordinated makes it easier to transfer to a different lines. There are signs in Korean and English, as well as the next stop announcement and makes getting around easier. Very clean and always on time."
145,5.0,"Although it looks complicated, it is quite simple to use.  There are free WiFi available and stations are very clean and easy to navigate."
146,5.0,"While residing in Seoul, South Korea at the Oakwood Premier Hotel for seven months, I used the subway system for all my commuting to and from work, shopping, running errands, everything!I found the subway to be very accessible but you can expect delays if you require the use of an elevator. Also, depending on where you are going, you can experience long walks making your way from one line to another at the transfer points. Also, during peak commuting periods, you can expect a lot of company and may have to wait for the next train and don't count on getting a place to sit right away!Most of the time the subway cars were well air conditioned but there were some occasions when the air conditioning was not adequate. Most of the time for me the experience was pleasant enough; you tend to get used to having a lot of people going along for the ride.I found that figuring out how to get from point A to point B was easy enough; the maps posted in the subway stations and in the trains were easy to understand even if you don't know the language. There is enough English translation and announcements to know when and where to get off. And the Seoul subway app is a good resource.The subway combined with the bus and train network enable the adventuresome to go pretty much anywhere! Be advised though that figuring out the bus system is not as easy. There is an app but it is in Korean and you may need to search on-line for an English tutorial to figure it out. Jim Tatum"
147,5.0,"Easy to use, inexpensive way to get around in Seoul. There are english singns and even announcements in englsih. Bring cash to pay for the tickets!"
148,4.0,Very useful !  Get your metro card and load it with enough money for your trips.  In rush hours it can be overloaded with people but it's the best transport if you travel with less than 2 people in the city of Seoul.
149,5.0,"Even if you are not familiar with the alphabet, you would easily see the whole city by taking the subway. They do skip sometimes, but they have announcements (in writing and voice) also in English both at the tracks and in the train. If you could spot yuor next station, you can choose your direction (at the tracks). T-money card is advised, very easy to buy and upload."
150,5.0,I loved the metro in Seoul.  It was easy to navigate.   There is an app available which also helped to plan a trip.
151,5.0,I come from a country that has almost no subways so getting on and off these is a bit of a mystery. But I downloaded the Seoul metro app and getting around with it was easy as. Cheap and gets you to the main spots around this great city.
152,5.0,The trains arrive on time. They are clean. They can be crowded at peak times which is to be expected. I used to get around the city and also to take to the airport. There are elevators for the elderly or disabled. Clean bathrooms inside station.
153,5.0,"When you arrive, buy a T-money card. Charge-it and you travel like local :)All distances is not soo close. Verify if you can take the last metro and connections.No service during night. (apprx. between 00.00 to 05.30)"
154,5.0,Download the subway map and take the metro. It is fast clean and safe. Buy a T-card to travel around with no hassle
155,5.0,"THe best way to go around seoul.Download application. It does the job for you. Routes , Wich side to board , and what exit to take when of, Wich is the best thing about it since it's another Seoul underground."
156,5.0,"I travel to Seoul often and the metro is very efficient, clean and safe.  Transit card makes it even better to quickly navigate through it.  Great shopping and dining also inside the many stations."
157,4.0,First time I saw map of MRT I was confused. But ticket machine was in english and pretty streight forward. I was advised to buy T-Money card what was pretty challenging for me because local people do not speak English very much so it took me long time to be able to bought this card. Benefit of this card is that you do not specify target destination when you buy your ticket. You get more freedom. It also looks like this T-Money card for accepted by taxi drivers. So after one day I got pretty familiar with metro in Seol. It is pretty fast and cheap. Next time I am in Seaol I will use metro of course :)
158,4.0,"Easy to use and convenient if travelling in city. Connects to all attractions and sights.  Both english and korean instructions. Train map on train is meant for 18yr olds with perfect eyesight. Announcements on train in Korean, English and sometimes Chinese."
159,4.0,"Dependable and clean, works.  There seem to be some accessibility issues, I've found a number of situations where stairs seem the only option."
160,5.0,"cheap, quick, clean, easy to change and follow signs, polite staff and fellow passengers etc., very good way to get around"
161,5.0,"This must be one lf the cleanest subway in the world, if not the cleanest.Local names are translated in English, same for ticketing machines and it's easy for a foreigner to move around.👍👍👍"
162,4.0,"This is a clean, safe, fast and inexpensive way to move around the capitol. One card will link to connecting buses and other Metro lines. The only complaint is long and complicated walks to change lines, perhaps due to the complex addition of lines over years. The walks nevertheless do not diminish the system's brilliant convenience."
163,5.0,Easy to use and very clean. The system connects most of Seoul and signs are available in multiple languages.
164,5.0,The Seoul Metro has to be one of the easiest to use and is also very clean and easy to understand even if you are not Korean or can not read Korean.  Easy and cost effective.  Many of the bigger stations have underground shopping and food so it is like another adventure if you have never been before
165,4.0,"I was initially intimidated with the system as it is my first experience in Korea. But once you get pass the first time, it is easy. The ticket machines do need some understanding to work. First the tickets are proximity card which if you purchase add a 500 won to deposit. You can at the end of the journey get a refund from the machine by simply slotting the card. Every station has at least one refund machines. So not issue. Just remember to claim back the deposit."
166,5.0,"Impressed with the cleanliness and organized, efficiency the metro is run. Easy to use and very helpful staff at the service kiosks make for a convenient tourist traveller experience. Ticket prices are reasonable with single journey and multi journey cards available."
167,4.0,Most of our friends are using metro these days because it improved a lot by quality and lines. You can use it easily.
168,2.0,"It is natural to compare with Tokyo subway/JR.Each transfer takes time and a lot of walking. Moreover , a lot of exits take steeps to walk through. Good as further exercises after a long day walk."
169,5.0,"I was awed by the subway system . its like a building where the city is the ground floor and the subway is the  basement 1 and basement 2. How I wish our country can have something like this. You can go anywhere, even at rush hour its not crowded, maybe because of the extent and many lines."
170,5.0,Very dense and efficient network. All information also available in English. Get a city map with the network of use the local app.
171,4.0,"Coming from Singapore, I found it surprisingly good that food and drinks can be consumed in the Metro. Maybe it shows that the people in Korea are so self aware of their actions, that allowing food and drinks in the Metro does not ends up witht eh train compartment being soiled and dirty."
172,4.0,There was no problems being a tourist here. We used the metro all the time and it was a very efficient mean of transportation.
173,5.0,"I've been all over the world and I've never found a metro system easier to use than Seoul's. I wish we had such efficient, clean, safe, affordable, and welcoming subway systems in American cities."
174,5.0,Seoul metro is best way to go around the city. Every major tourist attraction is connected by metro. Best thing is you can continue your journey on to the public bus with metro card or T money card.
175,5.0,"When you are young and travel lightly and can cover lots of distance, do use subway in seoul.  They are fantastic.  Not complicated fare system like tokyo.  Subways, yes you guessed it doubles as escape area in case of war. So if sirens start blaring do run to one of subway entrance and stay down there.  Hold out ten thousand won and call one of metro staff and they will tell you how to buy pass that can be used repeatedly.  Dont try to figure out by yourself.  Just ask any college kids, they will help you, always.Haven't seen anything better in other parts of world."
176,5.0,This is a good option for moving around Seoul - easy to use and easy to navigate with extensive coverage of the city
177,5.0,"From Seoul to Jeonju; the express bus to Jeonju has to be taken at the express busstation. the best way to get there is by subway. The ride is comfortable all the stops are shown in Korean and in english on the board so it is easy to know where to get off.Buying subway tickets is also easy because there are English machines and korean machines to purchase your tickets. finding your way in the subway corridors is also easy, just look for the right sign and line. the best thing is to check your exit on before hand that safes searching ."
178,5.0,I love seoul metro! So clean so well organized! And not so expensive. With taxi and metro! Seoul is yours!!
179,5.0,"Tickets had to be bought from vending machines. The trains were clean, fast, and there were glass screens on platforms that open when the train stops."
180,5.0,"Excellent metro subway station.Get a T-Money card and charge it up at a local kiosk in a subway station. You can do it in English too.Easy to navigate the system - clean, safe, and fast.I got a subway map at my hotel and it was easy to master the lines - each line is referenced by both line number and color."
181,5.0,"The metro is clean, quiet and efficient. Announcements in Korean and English in addtion to screens that show upcoming stops in both languages (one after the other, not simultaneous) and inform you of which side the doors will open at the next station."
182,5.0,The Seoul Metro is the fastest way around Seoul.  I recommend purchasing the T-Money card from the With Me convenience stores.  Before going through the turnstyles to the subway find a ticket machine and load your card with 20000 won.  That should last you a week.  The T-Money card is also good to use on buses and taxis.
183,5.0,"If you have ever been on the subway in New York or the tube in London you may think you know what a crowded car can feel like. Not exactly, ridding the metro at certain times can be so cramped that you may never get off in time at your stop for first timers. Saying this though it is a marvel and so very helpful to get you around such a crowded city. Have patients, and if you ""need"" your personal space then don't ride the metro."
184,5.0,"This should be one of Korea's proudest achievements, it is one of the best subway services I have used. Excellent."
185,5.0,Used the metro once and it was very efficient and clean. The machines where you get your tickets from have English button so that was helpful. Very much set out like English metro but much bigger !!
186,5.0,Don't forget to collect your 500 won at the end of your trip!  Metro is clean and very efficient...just pay attention so you get off at the right stop.
187,5.0,"Clean, punctual  (98%), exceptionally spacious, wifi connection throughout, heated in winter and A/C in summer, English language translation for stations and directions and verbal notification for next station, very very good value for money."
188,5.0,"As titled, we saved about $100 USD Airport to City using this instead of uber/taxi and saved hours using this instead of bus. The Metro is quick and stops at most places you would need to go. Easy to read signs and good announcements on and off the train."
189,3.0,Metro is well connected to all major areas on the city yet for new comers it's confusing to interchange and find right exits. After 1-2 days of using metro I was comfortable. Please note it's difficult to travel with kids or infants especially if you cannot climb lengthy stair cases as escalators and lifts are not always present. However it feels good to travel in metro and feel like a local.
190,4.0,"The subway system in Seoul is amazing. It is clean cheap and expansive. Just beware of the forks on some lines. For example, you could be online one and hit a fork in the road and easily end up going to the wrong location. Not really a problem if you're using a app and paying attention though."
191,5.0,"Seoul metro is very punctual. Considering the heavy traffic in Seoul, Seoul metro is the only reliable option if you are pressed for the time. Plus, the fare is not expensive."
192,5.0,"One of the best Metro systems in the world.  Get one of the apps to navigate easily.  Subways do not run into the early morning, and can get crowed at the morning and evening rush hours, but very convenient way to get around Seould and surrounding cities."
193,5.0,love Seoul subway system. Very pratical and unexpensive. And easy to access. Wish my home town subway is that good...:-(
194,5.0,"Regardless of which corner of Seoul you hope to reach the trains will likely provide the cheapest and most expeditious method of getting there. Much cheaper than Tokyo's trains, Seoul's various (two, primarily, competing companies if I remember correctly) lines will get you there. I lived outside of Seoul in Goyang-Si and never struggled to find an easy, efficient route to any corner of Seoul. The trains were almost always quite clean, though they could get terribly crowded, which isn't exactly unusual or surprising to any travellers familiar with Japan or Hong Kong's trains.  Fact is, many people live in the suburbs regardless of what country you visit, and there are going to be rush hours as everyone tries to find their way in to work, and if you avoid those peak transit hours you'll find much more ample seating available. I dealt with a modicum of grumpy/drunk ahjeosshi/ahjumma on the trains, but aside from a rare elbow to the butt or ribcage my daily commute was rarely ever terribly uncomfortable. Shoving was unavoidable, and sometimes annoying, but when you've got a huge percentage of the population utilizing the same train line to get into the city proper, you can't really be surprised at such things."
195,5.0,"This is the one. One of the best transportation services in the world. Metro lines are interconnected with all the bus lines through the whole Seoul metropolitan city. So, if you transit in half an hour, you don't have to pay for the next service with bus. If you start the trip first with buses, same thing for the metro. Isn't it good?So, why don't you try and taste. One thing!Most of them (passengers) are like the photo that I share with..."
196,5.0,"I have been all over the would and can say with reservation, after living in Seoul for the last nine years, that the Seoul subway system and the connecting K-Rail system is the best I mass transit I have ever encountered. Easy to use for an English speaker, inexpensive, frequent trains stopping at city wide stations, along with many attractions, underground shopping, eating and entertainment make the Seoul Metro a world class operation and the best way to see the city."
197,5.0,"Clean, efficient and easy to navigate is how I would describe Seoul's metro system. Everything is in Korean and English and the people are so orderly and polite.  Faster and cheaper than travelling by taxi."
198,5.0,Seoul station can connect to every place in the South Korea. You can cross the country using Korean subway and train services. It's a good way to know more the South Korea.
199,5.0,Very cheap and easy to use.  Very safe too.  You can get anywhere in the city AND the airports (both of them).  Traffic here is terrible.  This is the easiest way to get around.

204,5.0,"The metro network is extensive and the system works very well.  The signage is very detailed and once you get used to how they do things it's all very clearly done.  The trains are fast, clean and on- time.  And the cars are much wider than most cities' metros, making getting in and out during busy times much easier."
205,4.0,"Every station I visited had announcements and ticketing stations in multiple languages.  Some of the stations are confusing to navigate, and my ticket cards occasionally didn't read correctly immediately after purchase, but that may have been user error. If you can find your way to and through the station, you can easily go anywhere in the city even if you don't speak Korean."
206,5.0,"A very simple system that will take you all over Seoul. For a non-Korean speaker, this was still very simple!"

212,5.0,"Seoul metro covered a wide range of places, you can get anywhere with metro. You only need to remember the station number so you will not get wrong."
213,4.0,"Seoul metro is cheap & easy-to-navigate. Everything is in English as well as Japanese (& naturally Korean).   The only reason it's not getting 5/5 is that there are fewer interconnections than I'd like, given the scale of the city, and in comparison to the Tokyo metro network."
214,5.0,Very simple and easy to use transportation to travel in the big city of Seoul. stations are close to all major tourist locations.
215,5.0,Very easy to access all places. One of the best metros in the world. All stations have information desks and stations can be easily identified as they are written in english along with korean

The stations are conveniently located throughout and it is so cheap! Your best option is to download the Seoul Subway App which works offline, and tells you the times of departure, which is your best car to go in for transfers, where to transfer, and how long your trip will take. It was a life saver while I was living there! I lived and taught there for a year from August 2014 to September 2015 and it is the thing I miss most about Seoul (other than the cheap drinks and eats!). Do try to avoid rush hours if you are a tourist because the cars are beyond packed. Rush hours tend to be from 8am-9:30am and then again around 3:30pm-5:45pm. ALSO!! There are so many cool shops in the subway stations, you can get such great stuff (amazing socks!) and it is all reasonably priced. The best stations I found for shopping were Jamsil, Gangnam, and Express Bus Terminal!"
273,4.0,It is a big area - if you are going 1-2 km fine in a taxi but otherwise use this. Only downside is the Korean character set is so unfamiliar us westerners rely on simply the name and colour coding to get around. Some announcements are many stations are dual language but not always the case.
274,5.0,"The quality and cleanness of Seoul subways are excellent. There are more than 20 lines covering both inner metropolitan area and near cities, and fare is cheap compared with other countries. .Longest lines take long like two hours and reach places 50 Kms away from Seoul. Interline transfers are ok without additional charges. Even transfer to/from buses in Seoul and Gyungido is possible with a proper bus card, which is sold in subway stations. For tourists, it is a tip to use the services avoiding the rush hours for pleasant travel and sightseeing. Also some parts of the lines, usually away from the metropolitan area run on the ground good for sightseeing. Weekends are far better to use when it is not crowded.Note that many major cities like Busan, Incheon, Daejeon, Gwanju have the metro services with similar fare systems."
275,5.0,"Got a cute little card from the convenience store that I keep at least 10,000 won so I can ride without any trouble in and out of gates. I've only gone infrequently so I don't keep too much on it. Very easy to get around even if you don't understand Hangul...everything's in English! Platforms are very safe, they all have walls and doors so there's no danger of falling into the tracks, or of standing too close to the edge while the train is coming. Stations are very convenient, much more so than trying to park in downtown Seoul."
276,5.0,I used the metro in Seoul lots during my trip here and it was brilliant. The stations are all very clean and they are never too busy.

278,4.0,"Trains are clean, safe, well air conditioned, cheap, and run often.  Ticket machines in English were confusing.  Not sure we ever really figured it out, but the minimum fare ticket seemed to work OK everywhere we went.  They don't take credit cards but the cash readers worked really well.  Don't forget to put the card in the refund machine AFTER you exit to get your deposit back.Only downside was many of the stations were sweltering hot.  The trains were nice and cool though."
279,4.0,Every thing is good for this metro; convenient and cheap. Stations / platform is hot and humid during the Aug month.

283,4.0,"You should not avoid using it, since it helps you move across the city with easy. Each station is a large and crowdy underground market, where you can find almost everything."
284,4.0,"The metro complex is vast. Best to navigate it only with local help, as even the maps are confusing, especially if you need to transfer from one line to another. A big plus is that any transfer w/in 30 min of your start time is free. Also, peple 65+ ride free always. On the downside, it's both hot in the terminals in summer & cold in winter, altho the cars are comfortable enough. Still, if  you travel very far, be prepared to be uncomfortable when in the stations. But for getting around a city as large as Seoul, this is the way to go."
285,5.0,"Metro, getting a ticket from the machines.is straightforward with English language options. The stations and trains are clean fast and economical to useMake sure you read the map as to which exit you should use from the station or it could be a longish walk to where you want to be"

291,5.0,"Great way to get around the city, the metro is probably the most modern, efficient and cleanI have seen."
292,5.0,The Seoul Metro is very cheap and efficient.  Almost all of the stops have English translations and even the subway cars themselves announce the stops in English.  Do yourself a favor and download a Smartphone App (I personnally downloaded the MetroidHD app) that has accurate times for trains and recommended and best path's for navigating to your destination.  The trains are clean and comfortable.  Be prepared to stand if you are travelling a long distance or into/out of the more populated areas.
293,5.0,"Really easy and cheap to use the Seoul Metro system to go anywhere in Seoul. It is clean, but can be a bit busy."
294,5.0,It's very convinient to travel with the metro. The exhibition ceter was far awy from the center but with metro was easy to find it!
