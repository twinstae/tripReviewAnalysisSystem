0,4.0,"We went to watch FC Seoul play a night match as my son is a soccer fan. We all had an amazing time despite a light shower. The fan support was full on for the home team, even with maybe a fifth of the stadium full. Have not experienced the passion before in this size crowd. Food options outside before the game were great as well. An all round fun night."
1,3.0,"We went to the stadium at night and the match was between FC Seoul and Jeonnam Dragons. The guard requested us to pay for the tickets when the match was left with just 8 mins. We ended up talking photo outside the stadium and left soon in order to avoid the 50,000 crowds. A good stadium for photography"
2,3.0,Over it was cool that Japan and Korea co hosted the World Cup in 2002 the stadium itself is outdated or old nothing special. The basketball courts near the stadium and the homeless and restaurants are nearby so that's convenient!@@!
3,5.0,"Really cheap to get in and then we were allowed to wander. Visited the change rooms, media roomAnd was allowed to wander on the oval!! I could not believe we had so much freedom. Wife and son had a race down one of the wings!! Great morning in Seoul."
4,4.0,"We went because our daughter is a soccer fanatic. She said it was super neat getting to walk down on the field (behind a roped off area, on carpet).There is a museum area that tells the history of the game in Seoul. Can tour the locker rooms, which she thought was AMAZING!All in all, if you have an interest in soccer, this is a great place to check out!Visited: April 2014"
