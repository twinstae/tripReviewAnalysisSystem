Thankfully, the grilled fish shop that we went in closes at 9pm so we still had some time to eat. The aunties were friendly, spoke Chinese, and recommended the grilled mackerel. Food was served quickly and the fish tasted great. Didn’t need to dip any sauce cause it was nicely grilled and seasoned. Simple but has a nice comfort food feel to it."

I had my dinner in one of restaurant (but I forget the name) since the owner was welcoming us warmly. They have 2 floors. at 1st floor, they have tables with chairs but at 2nd floor, they just have tables so we have to sit at the floor. We sit in 2nd floor. It was good and quite cheap with a lot of side dishes and steamed rice. Try their jigae too to warm up your body in the cold weather. Don’t worry to order because they has an english menu. The lady owner was so nice, she gives 1 more grilled fish for free."
3,2.0,I went on Sunday around 6 pm and the place was closed. No stalls were open for business. Quiet dissapointing because I really want to try their grilled fish and spicy octopus. Is it closed every Sunday or only for special occasion? I don't think 23rd of April is a public holiday. Thinking of going to South Korean again. Hmm.
