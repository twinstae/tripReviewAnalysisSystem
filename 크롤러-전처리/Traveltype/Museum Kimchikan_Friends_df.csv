1,2.0,"Super Super Super small museum. You can check out the museum in less than 15 minutes. Admission fee 5,000 won (around $5). If you have never tried Korean traditional Hanbok, they have a few selections that you can wear for FREE. But you can only wear it inside the museum. Self-service. No much display or exhibits there. A very small room showing many different kind of kimchi, there is a tiny cooler inside that kimchi room that you can sample the kimchi. Then there is a ""art room"" that you can use the kimchi stamps on the post card when you purchase your admission ticket."

3,3.0,"This is a place I definitely would not have thought of, however a friend wanted to see it so I went along.  The museum is set up to guide you through a series of rooms that take you through a journey to explore every aspect of kimchi.  The displays are very interactive and modern, there are a lot of videos and educational touchscreen displays in several languages that illustrate how it is made, the health benefits, history and cultural significance.   There is a large touchscreen table where you can ""virtually"" go through the motions of making a batch.  If you already are familiar with how kimchi is made, you might find the part a bit remedial.   There are 3 movies in a small viewing room, but we could not figure out how to synchronize the audio guide so we watched one of them and skipped the rest.    At the end there is a small tasting room where two styles of kimchi can be sampled.  There are also classes and demos however we did not participate in them (it looked like they were setting up for a session later in the day). I am not a kimchi buff, so for me what made this museum better than expected was the high quality of the interactive displays.   Without these elements, in my opinion the subject matter would have only been mildly interesting. It is located in a Insadong, which is a great area to visit.  You don't have to spend a lot of time here.  If you are in the area and you LOVE kimchi or are highly interested in food/culinary history, you will probably find an interesting way to spend an hour or so."
