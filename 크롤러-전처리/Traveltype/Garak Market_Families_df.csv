0,4.0,"It needs a bit of walk from the nearest metro station (same name Garak Market) which station is not at city centre where the actions are taken (50 mins from Jongno-gu station). We need to walk through some openair wholesale vegetables and fruits markets before reaching this seafood market But the walk is worthy. We bought and bargained for fresh seafood including King crab, scallops, clams, abalones etc. They were kind enough to give us some more seafood for free. The raw seafood were steamed on the spot at the market on ground floor where we bought but served on upper floor inside a restaurant. Sat on floor/ tatami which was a challenge to me. There are some extra charges for the dishes of kimchi. We ate much to our satisfaction and price was only about USD 100. We will be back!"
1,1.0,"Family of four visiting the Garak market for a supposedly fun day. However, upon entering, it turned out to be the worst day of our trip.  Starting from the entrance, fish mongers block and hassle your every step.  They badger, touch, and grab as you walk by their stalls. I've seen pushy sales people before, but this was just wrong.  One particularly aggressive, red-faced fish monger accused us of accepting to buy his fish. We did nothing of the sort - mind you, we were using a Korean phrasebook - but as we started to walk away, he ran over and grabbed me. I shook him off and started to walk away. Just when we thought it couldn't get any worse, one of his workers - a crazed old lady in her 60's went ballistic and started swearing at us. I'm not sure if she was drunk or insane, but as we walked away she followed us for about 200 feet cursing and yelling at us. When we turned and attempted to calm her down, she went ballistic and hit my wife with a closed fist on her arm and then hit me on the back as I tried to shield my wife from the assault. My children (7 years old) started crying and then the crazed lady actually hit me again! I was a little stunned, but by this time, there was a large crowd of other fish mongers who started to gather around us. I really didn't feel safe after having noticed a couple of the fish mongers holding large knives!  I grabbed my wife and kids and beat a hasty retreat to the exit.Outside, we called the police. BTW, the police emergency number in Korea is 112.When the police arrived, we went back in with the police and confronted the crazed lady. She admitted to hitting us. However, - get this - the police basically said this was the culture in fish markets in Korea! Wow! Just wow!We called the US consulate and left a report. Here's the number 2397-4114.Moral of the story: If you are a foreigner and don't mind getting roughed up in a market and having unprofessional police who provide no protection and think its just a big joke, go to Garak Market. Otherwise, avoid like the plague."
2,4.0,This market is not close to the city.  And the seafood is much cheaper the one in the city.Nice and friendly people.  It took us around 45 mins to get there by railway from Myeong Dong.  Great nice place.  You may find some fresh fruits there too.  We had a lunch there and we had two set lunches which already filled our stomach.
3,5.0,"Row upon row of everything edible (and some I wasn't sure of). Walked a 4 km row that had nothing but vegetables, crossed over and walked 4km back with every fruit imaginable. Then we entered the fish market where we could choose any stage of the life cycle (baby octopus, full grown flounder & crab, ready-to-eat filets and eel, dried squid, etc.)  Choose your fish and the in-house restaurant will prepare. Many shops will even vacuum pack dried goods for shipping. Great values."
