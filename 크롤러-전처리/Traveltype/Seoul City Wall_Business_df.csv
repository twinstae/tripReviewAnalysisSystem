0,3.0,I only did a part. To hot....But it is really a good idea to do the complete tour. Start at the City wall museum.... you walk in the city and in nature as it seems. The museum is also nice!You have nice views over the city.
1,4.0,"I love walking so I really got much pleasure from this few hours slow pace walk. You get very nice views of Seoul and, thanks God, there are several places to have a rest during the trail. But you should be in a good shape - it's more like hiking in mountains than just walking in the city. And take water - it was my mistake, I forgot to take it - so I had some tough moments - climate in Seoul is very humid for me, so I felt not good. Choose comfy clothes and sport shoes, and don't forget your camera. The views are really amazing, especially from the park."
