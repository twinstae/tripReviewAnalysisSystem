1,2.0,"The only thing worth going here for is the green screen room where you can take your picture alongside the South Korean President in various situations. The only information is a timeline of events which occurred during each President's term; there's nothing about the role and powers of the President, the Korean system of government, national symbols, the legacy of each President etc. which you would expect to see. It can easily be skipped in favour of the countless more interesting places to visit in Seoul."
2,4.0,"I was impressed on how they showcase the Korean head of state, as if welcoming everyone to their country. It shows the replica of the office of the South Korean president, an interactive photo with the president, the gifts received by the current and previous South Korean presidents by different heads of state."
