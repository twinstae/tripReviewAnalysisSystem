1,5.0,"I visited Seoul and really enjoyed the time with my friends. We stayed in the capital for 2 nights and explored some famous sites there: Gyeongbokgung Palace, Bukchon Hanok Old Village, Seoul Stadium... shopping at Myeongdong was a must and tasted street foods there which would give us happy time for the trip."
2,4.0,"There are 2 subway stations nearby the park. one is green line and the other is yellow if i'm not mistaken. I think the yellow line is nearer than the green line. This park is not so crowded, we came around 6.30 pm and had a great time enjoying cherry blossom."

4,4.0,"If you look for the place for picnic and bicycle around eastern area of Seoul, this is the proper place to go. You can rent a bicycle or can bring yours. Itâ€™s good for walk and have rest throughout the day."
5,4.0,"I enjoyed walking around Seoul Forest. It was my first time visiting and I was surprised to see how big it was yet so easily accessible. Lots of paths to walk on and spaces to rest in the shade. There are plenty of benches, picnic tables and common sitting areas. Many people were also enjoying their picnic on the grass. A nice place for a family day or just for anyone who wishes to be in the nature in the midst of the city. With all the different trees, I think it will be lovely there in the fall."
6,4.0,"The place is serene. If you want to relax, exercise and take great photos, this park is one of the many places to be in Seoul. I would love to go biking someday around this beautiful place. Went there before spring comes to full bloom, but it was still gorgeous."
7,5.0,We went there for a quick walk on the last day of our trip. Seoul forest is located pretty much in city center and is easily accessible. It was very nice to walk around the park in a peaceful quite atmosphere.
8,5.0,"Very nice big park. Lots of space for a picnic now the weather turns warmer as well. If you like deer, make sure to go see them. The ""understand avenue"" is also worth a visit if looking for a nice beer or handmade goods."
9,3.0,My friend took me to Seoul Forest and we spent half a day there. It was a huge park and there were deers.
10,5.0,Seoul Forest is a beautiful spot in the middle of the city. I visited in November and the weather was perfect. The cool temperatures coupled with the autumn leaves made it one of my favourite spots in Seoul. Be sure to bring a camera to take lots of pictures. There is also a shipping container shopping center near by.

12,5.0,"Seoul Forest is an amazing place to visit on a sunny day. Plenty of paths to walk, flowers in bloom and seats to sit on under the trees. The Butterfly Garden and Insect House are great, even for those without children. The Deer Corral is also good, with a vending machine out the front where you can buy food to feed them for only 1000 won."
13,5.0,"If you want to avoid the crowd in Yeouido Island, Seoul Forest is the best place to go. You can peacefully walk around and take pictures without getting photobombed.I think the best place to visit Seoul Forest is during spring time."
14,5.0,"This place is amazing.  It doesn't feel like you are in the middle of a thumping big city.  A green space with artwork, grassy banks, trees and flowers, paths to walk and ride on, a deer park, bridges, fountains and a lake.  This is a lovely destination for a picnic on a sunny day and easily accessible by public transport."
15,4.0,This is a pretty good sized park which is great for families to take their children to. During the summer kids can get wet in the fountains as they shoot up and come down at various moments. Take them to the large playground with two long slides that they would love. You can find a lot of bike paths for couples and parents to ride along or you can play catch on of the two big areas of grass (one path is even lined with apple trees!).There are plenty of places to relax and many people even bring their tents. If you get bored you can see some unique modern art on the grass or check out the fish and waterfowl in the lake as well. The only downside is that it's a very popular place and it gets very crowded on weekends.
16,3.0,"We found it to be rather average. It was nice, but nothing out of the ordinary. If you are nearby, it's a nice park to go relax and walk around. However, we found nothing special to warrant the travel time to get to it if you're a bit further away."
17,5.0,"We went here in November so the surroundings are orange-gi. A perfect place to rest and avoid the city noise. It's kinda big and you need hours..... We had a lot of pictures here. I love nature, so I really enjoyed a lot. I want to visit the forest again in Spring and see the beauty of ""green"" Seoul Forest. There is a little flower garden which the flowers are in full bloom of yellow and purple.A perfect place to relax and have a walk with your friends, family or with your someone special. One of the places that I would really love to visit again."
18,3.0,"Seoul Forest is a nice park in the center of Seoul, with a nice environment. The park is big enough to make you forget that you're in the city. Nice playground for kids. However, although clean overall, it wasn't as maintained as other parks I visited. Also lacked cafes, restaurants shops or other ""great"" attractions to make this a ""must-go"" destination. I'd recommend visiting Seoul Dream Forest instead."
19,4.0,"Location: easily reach by bus or underground. (center part of Seoul, beside the Han River)Good Complex: with children facilities, jogging paths, wetland, animals and biking paths beside the Han River. There are also some cafe and convenient store in the park."
