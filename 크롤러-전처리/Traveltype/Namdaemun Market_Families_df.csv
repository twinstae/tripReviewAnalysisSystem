1,3.0,"If you live in a country where there is no big markets stalls like this, then this may be an interesting place to visit."
2,5.0,Great place to shop. Tons of people from different countries. On the spot money exchange. Yummy street food. Shopping off the street and can readily bargain.
3,5.0,"Visited the traditional market which sell traditional Korean cooked food, fresh food and other items like electrical appliances and clothes. Tried the dumplings, fried tempura, corn dog and others. Food was fresh and delicious. Definitely worth a visit."
4,5.0,"It is somewhat like dongdaemun. But nearer to Myeongdong, right beside Shinsegae department store. We encountered snow whil shopping there. Price of stuff are relatively similar to Myeongdong but higher than dongdaemun."
5,4.0,"Bought my breakfast there almost every morning. There is this particular shop that sells Pau. Hot and nice. There was another Ahjumma who sells Ham, Cheese and Egg Toast. Very good for a chilly winter morning."
6,4.0,Always enjoyed walking and bustling with the crowds for good food and shopping. Namdaemun market just grows into me with her charm of eclectic mix of goods and awesome food choices.
7,5.0,"Here you can find most of Seoul famous street foods and shopping area for clothing, hats...etc, but most stores usually close earlier by 10pm."
8,4.0,"This place is worth looking at. Especially the  jewelry building with hundreds of small shops.Anyways, not really a place where I would go shopping"
9,3.0,"Looks mostly like any market anywhere in the world, with some exaptions. Nice to walk through, but dont spend more then an hour tops"
10,5.0,"Everything you could want from Korea is available-at this market. Hundreds of outside vendors selling food, clothes, trinkets and so much more. If you are in Seoul you must go to this market."
11,4.0,"It is a traditionalMarket place with shops and street vendors .  We bought some socks , sun hats and dried fruit.   I also saw some knock off clothing and bags along with fur coats .  There were also food vendors and we got to try some traditional korean soup. Overall an interesting placeTo see for those who want to experience a more local vibe"
12,5.0,"Loved the market. One can easily spend half a day window shopping or shopping and trying out some street food. Pity that we got to spend only a couple of hours there since we were specifically looking for luggage. Would have loved to browse through the shops much longer and walk around. Definitely go there while visiting Seoul. Price wise, I did not see any great deals, some shops are open to bargaining and some are not. Nothing was really marked down. Nevertheless a great place to browse and look at things that you do not need :)"
13,5.0,So there is the day time shopping and night time shopping. If your looking for kids clothes you can come after 10pm to 5am. On #6 you can find many kids clothing stores. The key to getting a discount is buy more than one piece. I think the minimum is 3 and up. So we bought on this trip maybe 9 of the same kids sleep sack different colors and sizes to give to friends and it was much cheaper. For example a kids hat I bought was 15000won each but if I buy more than 3 it’s 9000won. If I buy three I save 3000won and get 3 hats! Anyway this is the deal and for accessories you need to buy by the dozens and many styles. The last time I came I bought hairpins for my kids and friends. They come out to 50cents each very cheap. There is usually less people at night and this is when the wholesale customers come so just be aware to get deals you must buy more. Also make sure you bring cash. This also helps since most money exchanges close before 10pm. Good luck shopping.
14,5.0,"We visited Seoul again after few yrs back in 2017,2016 & 2012 via Singapore.We went to Namdaemun market few times whenever we were in seoul and there are many things here & have many choices to choose especially a shopholic like me ^^ This year our second homestay located near to Namdaemun gate 5 and we love walking just across it."
15,3.0,"It is extremely huge and you’ll probably get lost, it goes underground overground and the streets go on and on. Anything you can imagine you will find here. So big that I actually lost interest and left with only some watermelon.....maybe it’s some twisted Korean reverse psychology so make women shop less."
16,4.0,"We bought some magnet souvenir and keychain here. We ask the information and they were very friendly. We loves the souvenirs. Overall, Namdaemun  Market is very good place to buy souvenir"
17,5.0,"A leisurely 15 mins walk from Myeongdong. Love the street food available. A great place for sight, smell and taste. Ate traditional korean bbq. It was fantastic and very reasonably priced. There's a small lane lined with small restos selling mackerel, beef soup etc. So yummy. There are stores selling cheap souvenirs to clothes, eyeglasses, contact lens. You name it they got it here."
18,3.0,"I believe this place is cheaper than Myeongdong, but not as interesting. You can go here if you want to shop at a really low price. We were able to buy a lot from here, and most of our souvenirs came from this market."
19,4.0,Lots of fun with so many different shops! Don’t miss out on the socks! So many choices! A fun environment!
20,4.0,"We stayed in Tmark Grand Hotel just opposite this market and my wife went crazy shopping in here for clothes for our daughter, so many stalls to choose from, so many new and stylish clothes for our kid. Bring lots of cash or stick to a budget, try getting some discount and it works sometimes.In the evenings there are many food stalls selling all kinds of snacks so you will never go hungry."
21,3.0,Namdaemun is a shopping area which is overwhelming. While it is conveniently located and shops are inside airconditioned buildings seeing so many stalls one after the after from one floor to the other can be overwhelming.  But the goods sold are definitely cheaper and you could probably find some good bargains.
22,1.0,"Place to shop for souvineers and snacks. Variety street food, fishcake, lobster tail, waffle, ice cream, and more."
23,4.0,"Visited on a Sunday afternoon. The place was full of activity, with shops selling everything Korean one can ask for – souvenirs, clothes, all varieties of Ginseng and other medicines....and of course an endless choice of food. A great place for bargain hunters and those who enjoy browsing. One must have plenty of time to look around – there is so much to see and discover. The food stalls in particular are a great attraction – one can have a full meal just sampling the items being made at the live counters. It is  on the City Tour Bus Route – just hop off soon after you start at Koreana Hotel and spend as much time as you want, before hopping back on the Bus and carrying on.....! A great experience indeed!!"
24,5.0,"Like any market ... a great place to find soooo many great treasures!  A lot of people in the Market and so many ways to travel within the market but there are info booths to help you out and also people in red jackets in the ‘intersection’ areas to help you.And don’t for get to ask for a deal! A great place to buy souvenirs! Oh, and you have to try the homemade dumpling booth ... there are a few but see the pictures for the one we went to!  Absolutely delicious!!"
25,5.0,Anything you can buy asking interpretation staffs who walk around the market for visitors'/foreigners' help if you need their kind service as free of charge.
26,4.0,"Although I didn't buy anything there, it's a great experience to browse the different items for sale. As I was walking around, I found the dumpling people are talking about in Tripadvisor. I bought all types of dumpling to try.....yummy! If you eat there, you can help yourself with the danmuji ( yellow pickled radish) which are placed beside the stall. There are no chairs and you have to stand and eat. Along the lanes are small restaurants. If you are adventurous, you can go in and try the local food. If you stay in Myeongdong shopping area, you can walk to Namdaemun market  - less than 900  meters."
27,4.0,Cool market. Not the modern market but the old school market selling both new and old school stuff. Lots of stuff to see and experience. Overall a nice experience.
28,5.0,"A must visit place in Seoul, this market is the largest one in Seoul covering over 16 acres. There is very thing here, be it cloths, toys, stationary or street food and a best place to buy Souvenirs for your near and dear ones. There are lot of shops specializing in selling refurbished cameras and accessories. If you are buying anything be ready to use your bargaining skills. And if you do not want to do any shopping, it is still worth visiting here."
29,5.0,"Come here if you want cheap gifts, t-shirts, fridge magnets, key chains etc. If you are into accessories, head to e-Lengdang 2nd floor. This is a heaven for accessories."
30,2.0,"Be careful where you eat, my daughter got a bad stomach here.She ate the round patty with vegetables inside, Try and eat the street food that is made freshly in front of you,"
31,4.0,"Went there by bus number 3 from Namsan Seoul Tower, 6 stops only. Quite a big market, as went during winter month of December, too cold to stay too long. Have good kimchi buns, fish cakes soups & food Valley with seatings to eat in comfort. Many shops to see, can bargain a little if buy more. Not all welcome bargains."
32,4.0,"When you start walking into the market, for those who have been to Bangkok Chatuchak market, there is a sense of deja vu. This place similarly has different section for clothing, accessories, etc. You must look for their food alley which serve very local food. Compared to BKK, this market is slightly more spacious so one won't feel as claustrophobic."
33,4.0,Thoroughly enjoyed strolling around this area and we bought some lovely souvenirs at the handicraft center.From crane bird boxes to Korea fridge magnets and chopstick-holders 😀Did not yet find a great place to eat local food but we’ll try again tomorrow!
34,3.0,"Actually a typical local market that people here to look for bargain. Sometime you may not get a good bargain either as you must know how to bargain. Lots of clothing, shoes, food and food stuff. Nothing special but is enjoyable to walk around and enjoy the atmosphere. One of the stall that selling the hot steam bun is really good.. Long queue and prepare to wait for your food."
35,2.0,"Okay market, but same thing over and over again.   Gave 2 stars for the food only, great Korean BBQ.   Okay experience just to tick the box, but you get the gist of it after 20 minutes."
36,4.0,"We arrived in the early evening on a Monday, and noted that some of the shops on the peripheral were selling produce that locals were buying.  Walking along the vibrant streets in Namdaemun Market, you will see many shops selling souvenirs, clothing, etc, as well as street stalls selling local food.  Worth a visit to see a street market in Seoul."
37,5.0,"Good to come in the day as you can catch many good deals in the many stores here. Fresh food sold in the Market, stationary stores , great gift giving ideas all in this one place-  a whole sale centre where you can buy almost anything including costume jewellery, wedding gifts, korean handicraft souvenirs etc"
38,5.0,"Cheaper souvenir and more choices. From keychain, mirror, pen, shirts and many more. Compare to Myeongdong Market. Can find halal Kebab within walking distance from the Namdaemun train."
39,3.0,Namdaemun is a market that mostly sells clothing. There are a few other types of shops sprinkled in but the majority are clothes and shoes. The quality is similar to what you can get in the underground subway shopping but prices are higher than what you will see at the subway shops.
40,5.0,The place where one could buy cheaper souvenirs than elsewhere. Grab anything that is cheap here as I regret for not buying much from here
41,4.0,"Went on a Sunday late morning. Seems like some of the alleys are not opened. An alley called the accessories alley is totally quiet and empty, the pushcarts are all covered up and the shops are not opened. However the Main Street is busy, with all the food stalls selling the different local food items. Many of the pushcarts are selling the same items but some are more patronised than others. Even if you dun know how to order/eat, just observe the locals and follow what they do. Besides food, there are many stalls selling imitation branded stuff. Some are such bad fakes- the words Tommy Hilfiger printed on a hoodie with another Brand’s logo. Reminds me of night markets in Bangkok. Have yet to explore the Kulguksu lane and the fish lane, but both looked busy."
42,5.0,"This market is packed with many locals and tourists. There is an assortment of food and drink (both restaurants and street food), fresh produce, garments and clothes and many others.There is a portion with many stores selling all sorts of cheap accessories and raw materials to make accessories and embelishments."
43,5.0,"Huge market with various things. All the stores are in their own building. They sell hair accessories, jewellery, kids clothing, ladies clothing and many more. Took the metro and stop at seoul station, walked the seoullo walkaway towards Namdaemun market"
44,4.0,"This place is for an older crowd... comparing to Myeongdong street market. Authentic, has its own charm of traditional Korean market. Buy anything under the sun. Lots to eat. KPop mania items. Pots, pans, great bargains."
45,5.0,One if our favourite spots to visited day or night. Crazy variety of street food at great value. Also interesting to shop for souvenirs and do some bargaining.
46,4.0,"The market is clean and easy to Find. IT has good places for clothes, accessories, eye glasses and souvenirs. Some local Food stuff are also available. Prices are cheap and a lot OF locals are here for marketing OF their Daily needs. We were only a handful OF Tourist present in The morning. A good place to feel The local pulse OF The City."
47,4.0,We visited this market area one morning while waiting for Shinsegae department store to open.All the clothes and “jewelry” looked like cheap low quality stuff.The food stalls were ok. There was one food stall that sold fish cake that was very popular.
48,2.0,"You can easily get lost inside this market. It's huge and most of the shops look alike. It's a shopping area mainly for clothing and personal items. If you are just buying a few pieces of clothing, I guess you are better off shopping in other areas like Myendong(?) where you can see more variety of goods to buy."
49,3.0,Seriously i doesnt really like this place but since i m in korea why not. My kids like this place. Locals buying here cos i think it cheap but nothing after all.Place pack with ppl n cars
50,5.0,Get Ho-Dduk in the front of Gate 2 entrance - honey filling and japchae filling.  Then walk up the street (into the market shopping area) for about 200-300 yards and get dumplings and donuts.
51,4.0,"My family and I went here to get souvenirs for the rest of the family. The best things (I guess!) that I got here were the brooches. There is a building with one floor full of little shops with the staffs making all sorts of jewelleries and ornaments. Brooches,bangles, bracelets, rings, you name it, are all here. Then change to another level and you will see they sell  vintage decorative stuff for your homes, tshirts and baby clothes. Maybe you can bargain (I didn't cuz I never really know how to lol) and get yourself a good price for the things you buy. Take your time as namdaemun market is a big area."
52,4.0,"On the last day of my trip, I went to Namdaemun Market to get some souvenirs for some people back in town. I wanted to get some beautiful brooches for my mom and most people know E-Lengdang in Namdaemun market is where you can get really beautiful brooches. I’d like to recommend one shop that sells brooches. The seller was very generous and had given us 3 free brooches after we bought some from her. She had told us that she uses real swarovski crystals for her brooches. The more expensive the brooches are, the more beautiful it is. Her shop is on the second floor and it is number 404. I have provided how the shop looks like and how beautiful the brooches that she sells! If you are looking to find beautiful brooches, you may visit this shop. Her brooches are the most beautiful I’ve found in E-Lengdang. Have a great trip!"
53,3.0,"Mostly cheap made items such as clothing, toys and ornaments. We did not really enjoy it that much as we couldn't find the unique locally made items we were hoping for."
54,3.0,This market is nothing but most of China made cheap goods.Only very few local made items are sold.A sweet made of flour and honey is the speciality and should be tried. It's even more amazing to watch how this sweet is made.
55,5.0,"Great day and night, cheap fresh food, souvenirs and general cheap items for sale.Safe friendly atmosphere with no pressure to purchase."
56,4.0,"Close to Myeongdong, this is a great place to pick up traditional artefacts and souvenirs at decent prices. The market opens late but is closed on some days - so check before you travel."
57,4.0,"This is the best place for souvenirs, we compared Myeongdong, Insadong and Namdaemun. Namdaemun is the cheapest among all these locations for souvenirs including t-shirts, key chains, magnets, masks, etc..."
58,4.0,"A big traditional market where you can get practically everything here..from children clothes, slippers, bags and souvenirs.. A lot of food carts and is good place to try all Korean snacks..Easy to access by train."
59,3.0,"This market was located opposite our hotel so it was very easy to access. The market seems to sell pretty much everything including clothes, kitchenware, fruit and vegetables, cooked food, hats, shoes, souvenirs etc. The market is actually quite large and there is a part called ""children's market"" but it had already closed by the time we were there. In front of the market along the main road are many shops selling camera gear, new and used lenses and camera bodies including all the famous brands so I think this was the main place for cameras in Seoul.Despite being quite a large market there are far more interesting markets in Seoul such as the Dongdaemun Market for fashion and the Myeong Dong Street Market which was very lively and seemed much more popular."
60,3.0,"We went here for clothes shopping. Store owners do not allow you to try on the clothes they are selling, so having a tape measure with us helped us to decide whether an item was the right size. A lot of the stalls were pretty expensive though (we spent most of the time by the clothing buildings near Hoehyoen station, Exit 5). Just found less than a handful of stores with the prices we were looking for, and ended up with a couple purchases. Even in the summer, there were still stores by the road selling fur coats! Would have wanted to spend more time exploring, but the heat of the day got to us.There's a lot of stores selling dried fruits, vegetables, even meat! I saw dried okra, dried peppers, dried strawberries, dried octopus (both spicy and not spicy)... the choices were endless!There's a road with stores selling stationery, wrapping paper and gift bags that had pretty attractive options. We saw a couple of skincare stores as well in the area - not sure if the prices are good compared to Myeongdong. There are information booths, but the one we saw was closed during lunch break."
61,5.0,"We went to the design plaza first, highlight was my daughter got to play the piano outside! Then onto the markets... its 4 storeys of fabrics,  ground floor lovely quilts, outside are zips and brocades, top 3 floors all material. Unless you are geographically minded, but it when you see it. I found a beaut green linen, decided to look around first and couldn't find the vendor again. Also, no places to sit or have a cold drink inside so be prepared. It was 33 degrees c when we went and even with air conditioning my kids were too hot and grumpy to go all around the building butI had no choice but to take them. Fabulous selection, patterns etc. Next time I'm finding a baby sitter"
62,3.0,"I would say this market is fairly traditional. A lot of gods, a lot of fake brands, narrow lanes and crowded. If you want to buy clothes from the market, or well, from most places, be prepared! Take your measures beforehand and bring your tape-measure! There are no such thing as a dressing room or trying the clothes on ;).The market felt big with numerous small isles both directions from what we called the ”main path”. As with most makets, it is a lot of ”same same” , meaning the same goods over and over. All in all, it was an experience but to us,  Dongdaemun market with Gwangjang market next to it was better."
63,5.0,"Namdaemun market was good. They have lots of clothings,toys and accessories for children. Their price for kids and adults clothes are reasonable. Souvenirs at namdamun market is cheaper compared to other places. Basically of all the places like Myeongdong street, namdaemun is better in terms of cheaper price and more variety of items. We enjoyed our shopping at namdaemun market."
64,4.0,"Our hotel was just 10 mins away, so we usually go through the Namdaemun market everyday.  It’s one big market that sells the same or similar things.  The market was confusing at first since every stores looked alike, but after a few times of getting lost we finally figured out the directions.  From this market is about another 8-10 mins walk to the other popular M market.  There were also a few food stands but not sure if it’s good or not."
65,4.0,"Food and shopping are the best. Local food and wholesale is found here, walking distance from Mydeong shopping area, grab a sandwich along the way, shoes n shirts at cheap price. Be prepare to walk and enjoy the fun of shopping, step into the aircon building and open another area to shop."
66,2.0,"2nd time coming here and still seem to miss the action. The last time we were too early coming before our flight, this time we were too late as most of the stalls and shops were closing. We were there just before dinner of about 7.30pm. The girls were disappointed."
67,4.0,It has something for everybody here and have sufficient variety that it is quite a good place to get everything.
68,3.0,"A traditional market for people of all ages. It depicts quite well the kind of lifestyle people have, from the young to elderly. The market sells clothes, household stuff and food."
69,5.0,"We spent about 1.5 hrs waking around and exploring the market. Plenty to see if you go in the morning if you like look at fresh produce and seafood. They sell lots of accessories, souvenirs and clothes but don’t expect high fashion and chic products here. The street food here is more traditional and tastier than in Myeong-Dong. Look for the yummy freshly made dumplings right in the middle of the market, they are cheap and delicious."
70,4.0,"Much cheaper here than in the supermarkets and/or Myeongdong for souvenirs such as seaweed, purses and Korean cutlery sets. There's loads to see here and can easily spend a morning here. They have a little food street too and the market is divided into different sections like kidswear, accessories, clothes, etc. We enjoyed strolling through the market and got a few last minute gifts. Worth a visit."
71,4.0,We had a lovely time at the Namdaemun Market. There were an assortment of wares on sales as well as street food to taste. A great attraction in Seoul
72,5.0,"The streets here are wider than Myeong Dong and prices of food might be cheaper too. Since we were travelling with stroller, we were not able to penetrate or go in Myeong Dong as the place was packed when we went. So we opted to go here instead.We bought some socks, belt, jeans, facial wash, and ate tons of street food. We loved the store that sold dumplings and meat buns."
73,4.0,"A diversified market. From clothing, bags, stationery, accessories, shoes, cameras to hiking gear.  They have it. They also have restaurants and cafes that serve very good Korean food."
74,5.0,"A very busy market in the heart of the city where toy get literally from A to Z.Qualitywise not necessarily to notch, but fun to browse through the narrow alleys and to take in the bit so familiar scents. If you have a tenancy to be claustrophobic, I would not recommend a visit during busy hours. At times you're blocked but people, hardly able to move forward or backward, neither left or right... and in parts underground. I enjoy observing the hustle and bustle of people and browsing for a typical Joann item (like brass dishes or similar)Generally it's mostly about clothing, but my size is never available neither my style. Very close by for larger wallets the first Shinsegae hosting upscale designer boutiques and a nice food section in B1On the other end of the market, the name giving Nandaemun, the former city gate and national treasure No.1 ( it sadly burned down ca. 10 yrs ago, but was restored to it's full glory)All in all go and visit as it's truly any experience!"
75,1.0,"We went to a shop there to get some dumplings (Gamekol Son Wangmandu as shown in the picture), and the staff was not welcoming to tourist at all. We didn't know Korean at all, so we tried to order by following the last customer's order, and to use body gesture and English to signal the staff we want to have what she ordered as well. However, the staff just grabbed our money rudely and ignore us totally until we repeated ask for someone to get our order. We were very disappointed as we have had very nice experience throughout our trip with others shops owned by Korean owners who know no English at all as well."
76,4.0,"Always visit this place when I’m in Seoul for the hotteok , buns and the children’s area with the wide array of good designs to choose from. It’s relatively inexpensive and there’s also shoe shops as well as street vendors who sell cheap tees worthy of a second look."
77,3.0,It is quite a large market and is spread out. Most shops were of accessories some weird and wonderful street food. The shops were cheaper than other supermarket. The market is easily accessible as it is in the middle of the city and surprisingly is open till late at night.
78,5.0,"Many people come here to get cheaper stuff, seaweed and baby/toddler clothes here!There are many eateries in this area as well and also a popular traditional eating place where you go jnto the market and sit side by side to eat! As the place is quite cramp, it is not advisable to have many things with you especially if have kids and strollers.There is also a famous brand nail cutter which can be found here. (If you know what I’m talking about!😬)There is an area which sells lots of baby/toddlers clothes and some area looks like those in Bangkok with lots of small shops within it."
79,5.0,"The place is always full of life. Food everywhere, lobsters, strawberries, chicken, pancakes, rice cakes, ice-cream topped with raw honey, fruits, grilled, steamed, boiled, anyway you can think off, they have it. Big and small restaurants, stand-alone stalls, stalls peddling clothes, bags, etc. Huge department stalls, brand name stores, all you need to shop to your heart’s desire."
80,5.0,"Cheap place to buy souvenirs especially brooches, fashionable socks and a lot more.  Highly recommended."
81,5.0,Very nice market with lots of things to see and buy if you need. You can find anything and everything you want. Be prepared to spend all day if you search for something special. I like it.
82,2.0,"1 hour just because I am walking with a 2 and 4YO. Found some unique street food and also a fruit shop (corner lot near Seoullo information booth) that sold cheap strawberries. If your intention is to buy souvenirs in bulk, then this may be suitable."
83,4.0,"Namdaemun market bustles on the weekends with laneways full of people. The more obvious shops are street stalls selling designer clothing knock offs and street food. Beyond those, there is also one street focused on high quality Korean paper and stationary. It worth a look for reasonably priced gift wrapping and gift boxes for that special occasion. Bulk birthday and Christmas cards are also available and great for kids birthdays. Location is the Western end of the market as you come down from Namsan Park."
84,2.0,"Closes early and repeats most of the stuff which Myeongdong has - but with fewer eateries. Trinkets are cheap knockoffs. Some of the skincare products and food products may be slightly cheaper, but it is probably not worth coming by unless 1) you are buying in bulk 2) have a lot of spare time in SeoulAvoid"
85,3.0,"I bought lots and lots of kpop merch, from Blackpink to Got7 to Twice, everything is available here. But, my main issue was that they closed way too early. I went by 8 pm and almost every store was closed or closing. It's still an awesome place to buy kpop goods :)"
86,3.0,We very much preferred the Myeongdong market over this one. This market is older but seemed to be just shirts and clothes not the diversity in Myeongdong. But we loved walking the streets and seeing the food and people.
87,5.0,"A really good place to visit if you're interested in the local lifestyle! There are lots of clothing, food and souvenirs to buy here. Pricing are low/acceptable as well! Some clothing can cost just 5,000 korean won and are made in korea. I would recommended this place for people who want to experience the local life. :)"
88,3.0,"We loved the food affordable and tastes good! Must Try the egg breadPotato with sausage Korean barbqEverything!But be careful when buying stuff likeThe clothing and hats, earmuffs etc.Please canvass first before buyingOur first night was terribleWe ate in a restaurant beside click hotelThey do understand English And we saw a group menu for 4 pax each Combo meal for 45,000wonAlmost 45-50 USDBut when they asked for paymentThey told us that the 45k won meal is for 2 adults and they charged us twice and we paid93,000won almost 100USD!!!we were 4 adults each table (3 tables)Since it was our first time and first dayWe did not complaint because we do not want a hassle on our vacation.Then at the street marketThe temperature on our first night reached negative 15-17 degreesThat our ears were freezing We looked for earmuffs immediately And this ladyGave us the price of 10,000wonI thought it was a good buyBecause the cold is not tolerable anymorewe were really upset the next day when My relatives bought same earmuffs at myeong dong train station only for 3,000wonOh well charge it to experience ;)Some people really take advantage to foreigners...Will Be wiser next time..."
89,4.0,"Namdaemun market is one of traditional market in Seoul. Unlike any other markets, they classified the shop based on what they sell. We went there to find things for kids. Unfortunately some of the shop were already closed, perhaps due to the weather. This market is known for its food's alley too. For noodle lovers, you should visit kalguksu alley near gate 5."
90,5.0,"the very first time i taste street foods. though, new to my taste, i tried it. i like some. perhaps, if i can see it always, i can eat it also they way korean people do."
91,4.0,"If you are looking for cheaper souvenirs this is the best places to get it. It is also walking distance from Myeongdong . Besides that, if you plan to try korean street food you can also try it here. Some of the street food prices cheaper than lots of famous places."
92,5.0,"The thing is, I'm a picky eater. I don't usually eat unusual foods but I had to try them here! You can also find silk, mattresses and all the sorts here in great material. If I had enough baggage, I'd buy tons of those!"
93,5.0,"If you are to bargain and wholesales, go here! Just keep bargain, walk around check for different prices. Even if they dont speak well english, just put a price on their calculator. 50% lower than what they tell you ;) Asian insights and intel knowledge"
94,3.0,"I decided to bring my family to Namdaemun Market for this trip. However, it was slightly disappointing. Saw a few YouTube clips to confirm our visit there. Basically, if you were to look for really cheap stuffs. There are many wholesale retailers there selling great varieties of items like fashion and home products, etc. As for food wise, I don’t see a great variety of food. We bought some red bean buns but didn’t finish them off. We ended up in a restaurant near exit 5 for our lunch. Can give it a try to patronise the restaurant that offer nice Ginseng Chicken Soup which located on the second floor of a building."
95,5.0,A must place to visit of u wanna buy gifts n souvenirs.  U can havr a good bargain and lots of things to.buy .
96,5.0,Go to line 4 and go out of exit 4. This a bustling market for traditional Korean goods. Street food is abundant and cheap.
97,5.0,"Some of the reviews mentioned this to be a night market, but not sure. A bit disappointed as this market was not the bustling place that I expected compared to other markets in parts of Asia. Most shops selling winter wear. In fact all markets and roadside stalls everywhere we went in Seoul seemed to be selling winter wear. Time of the year, I Guess. Food stalls were few and far between, though there was 1 stall selling delicious dumplings close to the metro entrance."
98,5.0,"my korean mum wanted that i see this market. It is not a tourist attraction and goods are for the everyday use for a korean household (which is very different from a western household !). It is fun to watch and eat street food ! You may not find something for the european taste as fashion is very different and sizes could be an issue (very small). Good buys in Korea for me are korean cosmetics, socks, dry food, teas, baby clothes (korean brands). Ginseng is very famous and expensive but not for everyone taste (bitter) !"
99,4.0,"The setup is similar to Malaysia's Petaling Street. Selling clothings, shoes, souvenirs, practically everything. Do try some street food if you are here. I bought 26 fridge magnets here for 10,000won. Also bought 10 nail cutters for 10,000won. Just to provide you an idea of the prices here. I didn't bargain...so maybe if you do, you can get stuffs at lower prices than me."
100,4.0,It's interesting to walk around and you can get some deals if you bargain in Korean although it feels like they try to take advantage and overcharge the tourists. We ate in food alley. The restaurants aren't very fancy but the food is authentic and good.
101,5.0,"If you are in Seoul, you must visit this market, the so-called the city's largest market. You can get almost anything here from clothing, souvenirs, purses, and food supplies. Many stalls are open into the wee hours of the morning. A very good shopping experience in Seoul. We managed to buy the Supreme clothing, souvenirs, fruits and also accessories here. There are lots of stalls & you will get lost easily finding your way out....definitely worth the visit!"
102,2.0,"The atmosphere at night here is a stark contrast to Myeongdong. It is dimly-lit and most of the vendors there look jaded and less enthusiastic about hawking their tired-looking wares. Though a few of their products there appear cheaper to Myeongdong ones, they do  not add up to much savings. The goods hawked are dated and nothing special. Not worth the trip."
103,5.0,There’s quite a bit of shopping done here despite the very cold and freezing weather. It was a good shopping experience. We went back a second time. The Korean ajumas are very nice and friendly!!  Will definitely revisit if I come korea again
104,4.0,Very good selections of choice of things to buy. And street food as well. Do shop around before you decide which shop to buy from. Same product might be selling at different price just a shop away
105,5.0,"I had not been here for almost 25 years, I could still find my way around and loved the hoetok sweet pancakes that I remember as a kid!"
106,5.0,It’s not your fancy and most urban market if you are going for that reasons. But if you want to experience the most famous street food and buy a souvenirs with a super reasonable prices so it’s your destination.
107,5.0,Nice place to go and experience korean street market.  U can walk from Seoul station either via sky bridge or exit 5 of line 1 Seoul station.
108,4.0,"This market is so huge that we got lost walking around this place. As compared to the nearby Myeongdong Street market, the prices are are cheaper but the place is not “classy”.  A section of this place is a wet market and there are many wholesalers. Recommendation:1. Go there during the day as this place become like a ghost town after 8 pm. 2. Clothings and jewelries accessories and bags  are aplenty.  3. Beside the street stalls, try going into the shops in the many buildings where you can find more and better merchandise."
109,5.0,"I initially went here to find Swarovski brooches but it turned out the place and satellite area offers a lot more. You could get cheaper korean souvenirs here compare to other tourist attractions... fridge magnets, nail clippers, cutleries etc... you name it. The Korean Swarovski brooches almost made me run out cash hahaha. we went straight to kiosk 168 at 1st Floor E-lengdang. The salesperson already know how to converse the prices in malay, so obvious malaysians go to her... there are hundreds more swarovski kiosks there ranging from brooches, bracelets, tiaras, watches and baju melayu buttons... so ladies bring enough cash!the cutleries such as korean spoon has so may design and way cheaper here. the place is open at 7am and closes at 5pm so be early."
110,4.0,"It's a tourist destination, therefore nothing is cheap here, particularly over the weekend. I see a lot of tourists with big shipping bags here, but I really don't know if they get a real deal. Lots of other tourist's destinations nearby, but are disguised by the luster of this market."
111,5.0,The market place existed very few hundred years and still going strong. You will find everything and able to bargain for it. It’s discovery experience if you know what you are looking for.
112,4.0,"Exciting market where the line ""shop 'till you drop"" becomes a reality. There are buildings after buildings of shops with clothing apparel, shoes, and everything in between. Haven for wholesalers too!"
113,4.0,"If you plan to visit Seoul, ensure this market is your first stop. You can get lot of local fashion attire here with cheap price compare to Myeongdong Street including children fashion. Price range start from 1000 won. Basically this market is just beside Myeongdong Market. Shinsegae Department Store is the divider of this two street market. If you travel with kids, just take a taxi, it only cost you less than 5000 won from any of Hotel at Myeongdong area.You can find souvenirs, kimchi & other local food here, clothes, bag & etc.Lot of restaurant also available along the street. Street food start around 3pm onward.Basically lot of choice & you may spend 3 - 4 hours here.If you looking for local foods, look for this shop (Sale Market No. 1), the guy very friendly & able to speak a little bit in Bahasa Malaysia or Indonesia. He gave us some discount, extra free foods & travel plastic bag."
114,2.0,There are many markets/night markets in Seoul. But most things are pricier than in Singapore. But in any country shopping should be one large part of your iteniery as this will keep ladies happy and best way to interact with locals. When you are tired there is no shortage of coffee shops to sit and relax
115,5.0,We have been living in Seoul for more than a year and have visited the Namdaemun market occasionally. There are several stores of interest and even if you don't intend buying anything just a stroll through the market will be interesting. Ensure you have cash on you should you decide on making purchases - smaller shops accept only cash.
116,5.0,"We visited this market few times. So much to see, shop and buy. The market has practically everything. We loved bargaining and shopping for socks. Do not miss the delicious deep fried honey/vegetables buns located at gate 2. There's always a long queue for these buns.When there, go to Gonggam restaurant for their extremely delicious BBQ meats. Lunch deal is extremely worth it👍👍👍"
117,5.0,Great shopping street Good price for goods one time visit not enough you will come again and again thanks you
118,5.0,This is an old market that's very famous in Seoul for cheap goods and eats. You'll find almost anything here. It's close to the center Myeongdong. Be prepared to bargain you might get things even cheaper.
119,5.0,We stay at Itaewon.Took the 421 bus line towards Seoul station.Namdaemun bus stop just after Seoul station.Different than Myeong-dong.Should visit to experience it.
120,3.0,"We headed here as soon as we arrived Seoul. We expected more after read the article from the guidebook. It is more wholesale market , from accessories, stationary to clothing. The price can be negotiated in some shops, so try to do first. The food stalls offer foods to the tourists so, do not expect the good flavor or reasonable price!"
121,4.0,"I always visited this market every time I came to Seoul. We can find lots of various things here: souvenirs, clothes, socks, hats/caps, umbrellas, bags, luggage, ginsengs, fruits, chocolates, home decorations, cosmetics, local food, etc etc. And, in many shops, you can bargain the price. I always had fun strolling along this market, having checked all the things, blending in with the local people and tasting the local food. For me, this market is a must visit market when I visit Seoul. :)"
122,4.0,"It's a traditional market, you can find a lot of snacks, souvenirs, clothes, etc. You can get cheaper price for wholesale."
123,4.0,A huge market with a mix of items from pots to shoes to clothes to souvenirs and foodstuff.Style is more suited for the elderly though there are a few stalls selling kids clothing and accessories. There's also a huge wholesale building selling women accessories but they are truly wholesale and wouldn't accept any purchases less than 10 pcs.
124,4.0,"We went here on day#2 our holiday in Seoul.so many stuff people sell here; fashion like a tee shirt,pants,socks,shoes,hats,jackets,etc.there're a mini restaurants with cheap price offer many korean foods and it's deliciuous.At the middle along Namdaemun street there's Tourist information,police office,and the shops which sell cosmetics such as : Aritaum,Ettude,Nature Republic,etc.This market open at 9am and close at 9pm.dont worry you will get free wifi here.You can reach Namdaemun market bu subway,get off at Heoyeon Station (Namdaemun Station)  exit 5."
125,4.0,Came to pay a visit since near my hotel. Not much things to buy and have small street food stores like myeondong too.
126,4.0,"We come here everytime we visit Korea because our interests change as our kids get older. No longer need the tourist trinkets, it is now for the clothes and accessories.  Our family loves the variety these markets bring."
127,4.0,"5 to 10 mins walk from MRT station. Best about it is I do not need to wake up early, yet still gets to eat and shop. Food here is traditional, cheap and really niceeee!!! Certain stores you can just seat in to enjoy your food. I vote for a twist donut store run by an elderly. She's alone, so customer needs to help to coat the fried donut with sugar and drop their money in the boxes. There's also a big hand made noodle store, the stock was light and nice. Customer can seat in to enjoy their food with complimentary kimchi. There's also fried food stores available. People there are friendly and nice. Worth going!!!"
128,4.0,"One of many street side shopping options is Seoul. You get anything and everything you want...From souveniers to clothes to bags etc . Bargaining options vary. Most places were fixed pricing , you can probably do a little bit of bargaining but not much. However there were other stores where you felt like bargaining a lot ( some bag stores etc) .most of the stuff is made in China like in all countries now. So you can compare prices vs India and then decide what to buy and what not ."
129,5.0,"Have been there a few times. I enjoyed the cheap and traditional stuff that can buy at there. Especially the traditional snacks, they usually sell cheaper outsider the road, but not in the market. And the category of the market is various, so worth spending time to explore this traditional market"
130,2.0,"Came here during dinner time (6pm), and there was nothing available! The stalls selling clothes and gifts were either closed or packing up. And the supposed ""food alley"" was empty. Was there on a weekday."
131,5.0,"Great to walk around and try some local street food. Busy, vibrant and great vibe. Loved all the different goods (yes, lots of knock offs), especially, liked all the cosmetics stores."
132,5.0,"A place to visit although there are areas that are very steep. This place sells mostly clothes which was not my primary interest. There are also seaweed souvenirs, cute plastic bags, stationary shops, local food produce and even house hold use stuff.They sell seaweed in a big bulk and some shops may be more expensive than others so remember to negotiate.  There is also tourist information area which is great. They are very helpful and can direct you to the right place. Manage to buy some fresh korean ginseng there and also had early lunch in a barbecue eatery."
133,5.0,"First time i go to Namdaemun market, just a view of them still open. That's because already 9.00 PM (Korean Time) but second time i go there, all of them open, and if you travellers want buy gift for your friends or family this is the right place to go. In here you can buy traditional gift too same like at insadong with cheaper price."
134,5.0,"From young to old, boys to man to the only woman, we all love this market.  Things to buy, food to eat (and not ex!) and warm benches to keep u warm! Only regret is too little time!"
135,4.0,"Much korean souvenir,kosmetik(aritaum shop),street food,ginseng.it's a cheaper shop than myeongdong.much of the seller can spaek chinesse.it's star from 10.00am and much close at 10.00pm.not open 24 hour"
136,4.0,"We went there to sea the tradition products like Korean red Ginseng and we found it there. There lots of different shops from clothes, seaweed , Ginseng and souvenirs. There are some shopping carts also in the middle. It is good market to visit while in Seoul."
137,5.0,"really worth your money shopping here... the prices were cheaper than other shopping places. you can find almost anything here. it is traditional market, and you can bargain too...  hehe... i came here twice the last time i visited seoul. when i came around 9pm,there's still some shops open though many others were already close."
138,4.0,"There are lots of local hawkers and almost every stall are selling same food, what I like the most is the salted fried chicken only dose you 7000won for whole chicken, so delicious, abit regret only have one, cause we can't find it at other place.If you want to buy some local snack food, you will find some there. Buy for friends or family it's a good choice, try to bargain abit before buy. (It's changed if compare last time, nowadays they not really willing to give you discount). But still insists never try never know. :) Nothing much can do here, only if you enjoy local food."
139,4.0,"Interesting night market with lots of food and of course clothes like socks and jeans, nothing you don't get elsewhere. Nice night out but you need to check the clothes you buy since they often wink out something out of the bag which was not what you chose!"
140,4.0,"A street where you can find great bargains from clothes, shoes, beauty products and street food find. A great place to bring bargain hunters and foodies alike. What I dont like about the place is the access. Its so hard to go down and up the underpass due to lack of escalators."
141,4.0,"if u are taking metro, get off at hoehyeon station exit number 5 i went to namdaemun for buy some korean souvenir such as key chain, refrigerator magnet, bookmark and so oni went to this market at the morning, i think they give more good price since morning still not crowdedif you are going to have a good price souvenir, u need to enter daedo buildingjust go straight from exit no 5 and you will find orange building on the right sidethey give lower price rather than souvenir outside"
142,4.0,Good place to find cheap stuff. Lots to see but had to navigate with a pram. Seoul not so pram friendly.  But the folks here are really friendly and tolerant of a crying baby.
143,3.0,"This market is actually about a 5 minute walk from Myeongdong were our hotel was located.   Is a relatively large market you do need a map, the good thing is that they have a help desk right in the middle were they give you a map a tell you where you can find food and other things.  We had dinner there actually it was the best Korean bbq ever!! but not cheap.  After that we walk a little and check some stores which also are not that cheap but if you walk around you can find some stuff for a good price, I particularly walk and compare prices.   I did buy three shirts for $10.  It was actually a good deal I guess it was because they were closing and it was the last sales of the day.   But I do recommend you walk enjoy every market in South Korea."
144,4.0,Many stores are not open when we went on Sunday. Wanted to go to the children store building but was closed. Cheap clothing and lots of sock street vendors everywhere. Snacks from street stalls were yummy.
145,2.0,"We came here and saw a korean bbq sign that lead upstairs if one of the market stalls. Went up and ordered and the bbq was average, and charged us exorbitantly!! I got one strip of pork for the equivalent of $20 usd, where the photo shows 5 strips. My 3 year old could have had 8 strips... same went for my son and his order... we thought that she would bring out more but did not, so we had to fill up on kim chee and sides that were topped up about 3 times. At the end it cost about $35 usd per person, which is expensive for korea... average meal would be about $5-10 per person usd... and this is no expensive restaurant."
146,4.0,this is the place if you want to find a cheap souvenirs and shopping. you can find a cheaper price for souvenir for your friends and indulge yourself in finding your own sparkling brooch and jewelry.
147,3.0,"Should visit once, no need to repeat. Gwangjang market is a way better option to see more local Korean food and stuff to see"
148,5.0,Love this place. Lots of things to see and buy. Can spend half a day walking around. Lots of cheap things to buy and enjoy the local culture. Good for parents looking for children clothing. Lots of cheap winter wear and accessories.
149,5.0,It takes awhile to browse but you can find just about anything here for less than elsewhere.  Many cafes and lunch places too.  Parking in a lot is easy and close.
150,5.0,"I've been to Namdaemun Market three times over my past five visits to Korea, and I always love it.  This past trip my husband and two teenagers joined me.  There is just so much to see here and it can definitely feel overwhelming.  You don't have to see it all, but just wonder around and enjoy the wide range of shops and food.  If you would like to find something specific, or if you get lost, look for one of the nice men and women in long yellow coats.  They speak English and have maps of the market.  My son really wanted to eat Korean BBQ for lunch and these lovely guides helped us find a place."
151,4.0,"I come here every time I visit for children's clothing and my ""big size"" ladies clothes. For a lady with volume with no typical ""Asian"" shape, look for ""big size"" signs. You can barter here for a better price. The shop owners act all upset and so on but they eventually come around. If you are unhappy with the price, walk away! Shop owners know enough basic English to sell goods to you and there are many eateries for you to enjoy if you don't mind Korean food."
152,5.0,"You can find a variety of foods here. Especially the kalguksu alley (handmade noodle alley) has a lot of nice and tasty kalguksu. You can also buy food souvenirs here such as the famous jeju chocolate, variety of seaweed, ginseng, honey for tea purpose, etc. It's not a good place for apparel shopping, household goods shopping (korean traditional spoon, bowl etc.), and cosmetics (etude, nature republic etc.). You can have some Korean snacks here such as fried foods or traditional ones. There's also gochu garu (red pepper flakes) and other banchans (side dish) sold here. The time spending recommendation is around +/- 2 hours. The best time to visit this place is at noon or afternoon (12 - 4). They are mostly close on weekends so go there at weekdays. At night you can go to myeongdong by walking (follow shinsegae department store) for 5-10 mins."
153,5.0,Namdaemun Market is the first market we visited during our trip in Seoul. Not sure how it compares with other markets but we got to try a ton of different Korean food. There weren't a lot of people during Thursday night. Very close to our hotel so would probably visit again!
154,2.0,Nothing caught the eye. What is sold here is practically found in every underground shopping centers at same price. Haggling effort doesn't justify discount.
155,4.0,"The street is filled with street stalls, selling socks - best deal - 12 pairs for $10.000 won, souvenirs, winter jacket, cap, shoes, t shirt etc. There are also snacks stalls - crab stick, fish cake, dumpling etc. Lots of tourists, and need to bargain. Good to visit if you have time. If no,t Lotte Mart is better for shopping - in quality and selections."
156,5.0,"I and my mom decided to take a walk to Namdaemun Market from hotel. It was a decent walk as I had a good map from the hotel. From the hotel to the main road was a wide road with many cars. As we walk along towards the market using the subway underground crossing, it was truly unbelievable. You can actually find out lot of things underground before reaching the Namdaemun Market. A proper sign and lots of handicraft items to be purchased. You want it and you can find it. These are the oldest shops underground. I bet none of your tour guide will let you know if you do not explore that yourself.After a walk, we finally reach Namdaemun market. The sign was on your feet and I was trying to search for the sign on top of the street. The market is a long walk as many things you could find and don't forget to bargain. I got a fluffy rabbit keychain beautifully made. I think you only can get this here and I truly can't find it anyway in town. There were few restaurants or street food only on the day we visited. Namdaemun Market has the goods you wanted depending what you really want it. Choose your path as you won't get yourself lost in the middle. You can get decent clothes and really nice design beside DDP.Get back to the road and when you reach to an end, you can find Shinseke and Myeongdong. So, what are you waiting for? Go for a walk and truly cold during winter but really a nice place to walk about and get my Runningman T from this hawker stall. Hope you like it. Just walk and find the fun!"
157,5.0,This place can be very busy but do not let this put you off. It is big market that sells food and some material goods. If you walk to the end of the market you will find a city gate that will provide a great picture opportunity
158,5.0,"These market practically provides and sell all kinds of things a market should sell. They have some nice food here like the tteokbokki, kimchi steamed buns and more. Lots of money changers are also located here in the market. It's a great place for tourists to visit, it's ok to buy souvenirs here as the price is not that expensive."
159,4.0,Well this is one place that has not changed much in 50 years. Cheap everything and you can bargain a little. You just get lost in the lane ways and pop up 2 hrs later and head straight to a local pub and have a good draft beer!Close to subway and the high end ships as well as Myoung dong street across from Lotte dept store. Not to be missed.
160,4.0,"There is a nice street to get affordable children wear and accessories. Look for street name: Namdeamunsijang 8-gil. The majority of the children shops closes on Sunday. The shops open by 10 am from Monday to Saturday. For example, children socks very affordable from KRW1000 per pair."
161,5.0,"This market is the perfect place to spend a few hours browsing, eating street food, and taking in the culture.  They have incredible deals on adorable socks- many are as little as 1000 won/pair- and t-shirts, as well as souvenirs.  There are also many shoe shops and clothing stores where you can get clothes for bargain basement prices.  Definitely do your souvenir shopping here and try the street food!"
162,3.0,"The market is quite big but almost all the stores are selling similar products. Cheap clothes , bags,  shoes mainly for local people. It's good for experiencing local market but don't expect can do much shopping there."
163,5.0,"It's a South Korean special place, you can see and eat a Korean food, dumplings, the best and spicy kimchi.....you can eat all this food here"
164,4.0,"Took the kids here looking for an interesting shopping experience. Could get nearly anything you could want. The vendors that spoke sine English would try to talk to you and we're friendly, but those that didn't did not hassle you in anyway. Got a few souvenirs here at one of the stalls."
165,3.0,I wonder how many products are actually Korea made being sold there.  But its a nice place to experience local market shopping for fashion and accessories. Buy in bulk to get more discount.
166,5.0,This is where you can get your souvenirs and local snacks for a much cheaper price compare to Myeongdong and other areas. They also have lot of street foods. Do ask for discount when you are buying more than 2 items and also the prices stated in the products on display might be lesser if you approach the staff. This is also a place where you can get wholesale ladies accessories like earrings and chains which are handmade. You can basically see them doing it at their stalls. But the walkway inside is very narrow so those with big haversack got to be careful.
167,4.0,"Metro stop for market is Hoehyeon. Entering at gate 5, found vendors to right selling pancakes & tempura like offerings. The pancakes would make a good breakfast item since they are pancakes with jam & cinnamon surprises cooked in. The assorted tempura items were good especially the shrimp. Just 86 the head & eat the crunchy rest whole.If up for a fish or chicken stew lunch, find the fish & stew alley. The tourist info booth is just further in from gate 5 for a market map. Check out the alley & go with what looks good."
168,5.0,"This place is Market kind of shopping where it sells clothing,bags, shoes and foodie (hardly Halal food). Good place to buy souvenirs as compared to other place ,here is cheap. To my personal view this place basically attractive for elderly people. Only souvenirs place its great to visit. Money Changer - Hard to findprice          : quiet reasonablenegotiable: depends"
169,4.0,Really worth visiting if someone is interested to go shopping for traditional korean stuffs along with other clothes etc. Big market with serpentine streets in between stuffed with any thing you need. From bags to jewellery...anything you can think of. They are mostly Korean made so a bit costly as compared to those chinese made...but quality is good. Always recommend to go for shopping at Namdaemun...and ofcourse you have lot of foods to keep going!!!!
170,5.0,"Do not try to haggle too much here, they will get offended as they consider their prices are already quite low. It's not quite as friendly as itaewon or myeongdong but you can still get quite a deal here..."
171,5.0,It is a good place to visit for a taste of korea culture. I love the cinnamon bun that sold for 1000won. Be sure to get that or you will regret! Lots of things to look around. Try out abit of everything will be just sufficient for the day
172,4.0,"A huge market that seems to sell everything (though not a food market really). Definitely worth a visit as while it's a tourist attraction it is clearly also where the locals shop! Could easily spend half a day seeing everything! Good cheap and nice kids clothes section towards the Singshagae/Mesa department store end. Also good kitchen foods, Ben linens and towels etc. I tried to bargain with little luck but worth trying! Try the food stalls as they are yum!  On the outside road of the market there is a whole road of stores dedicated to authentic camera goods."
173,5.0,"So this market is like a maze! Very cool but you will get lost if you don't keep your whits about you. I found it easier to navigate once I started snapping pictures of where I took turns, sort of like leaving a bread crumb trail to find my way back on my smart phone. It's crazy busy at times but it had a very relaxed chill vibe. I liked this market quite a bit. The subway is very close by."
174,4.0,"This is a market place with everything under the sun, Street food, korean food and merchandise. . Can be very crowded especially at night. Both locals and tourists patronize the place. Can bargain to take down the price especially as you go deeper inside.  Typical Korean street atmosphere. Good place for photography of various activities."
175,5.0,Best and interesting market you can find from clothes to food . Enjoy with my family and children to visit .
176,3.0,"Located in touristy area. This street market is fairly large and sells mostly durable goods like clothing, jewelry, bags, etc. there are some street food vendors and shops. Great place to walk around and explore."
177,4.0,"This's was the best shopping area for me so far and I will go back before we leave! Great street foods, and lots of Korean goods and quaint restaurants! We tried the Shabu Shabu here and it was great, especially with a couple of bottles of soju! We also tried fish cake pastries, egg bread, fish cake on sticks, ttheubukki, and fresh fruit."
178,4.0,"The day started with our free and easy ""exploratory"" walkabout in the city and had visited the Dongdaemum Market (including its Stationery and Toy Street, do refer to my earlier review of this place), the infamous Gwangjang Market (I have also reviewed the place earlier, do check it out) and as it was still early (around 3.30pm), so we decided to dropby here for a visit though we initially did not schedule to visit here (as we were told it's a market similar to Dongdaemum but smaller and offer similar things as there).The train took a mere 15~20 minutes here and upon exiting from the entrance of the subway station, we were amazed by its magnitude and ""crowdedness""! It was so crowded and have lots to see and do, way beyond our expectations.But for ladies, this place is a must visit for shopping, be it as the shops, shopping malls or at the makeshift stores as many are selling fashion, shoes, bags, jewelry, cosmetics etc. However, men and children need not feel bad as there are also several stores here that cater to your needs, like toys, fashion, jeans, electronic and electric products and on top of that, several cafes, eateries, souvenir, food (fresh and dry food), snacks etc can be found here too! Apparently, one can spend hours shopping here!Remember, do walk along the small and back lanes as well (as there are many shops located there) besides the main walking street or you will miss out quite a lot. The prices here are relatively cheaper than elsewhere (i.e. Myeongdong Shopping Street etc). One good example was the Korea's T-shirt. In Dongdaemun, 2 of them cost 10,000 won (Myeongdong is about 12,000-15,000 won), right here one could get 3 or 4 T-shirts at 10,000 won (similar quality and design).There is also a place that mainly sell gardening and flower/plants. Cannot remember the name of the building (but its a green building and the ground level is a big costume jewelry shop and the gardening section is located on the 4th storey and believe you me, its massive!)As the evening dawned, the place was getting more crowded as more makeshift stalls were opened for business. And some shops were running promotions, with the aim of clearing their stocks and these shops usually attracted a lot of people!We spent about good 2.5 hour here and bought many things before making our way for dinner. We actually wanted to spend more time here but were tired from a full day of walking since 8.30am and had bought many things (and also fear of the crowded trains). Of course, adding on to that was the sunny and warm weather!!!Well, some may say this place is touristy (just like Dongdaemum or Myeondong) but we find it quite nice and lovely here with many locals also coming here to shop and buy their daily necessities and important thing is that the prices are very reasonable! In fact, we bought most of our Korean products and gifts here than elsewhere!Highly recommended."
179,4.0,"Lots of streets and places to pick up bargains.  Hanbocks (?), food, etc.  My second visit and i'll be back on my next visit."
180,2.0,The market composes of small shops and carts selling mainly cloths but unpacked with higher price than other places. It is crowded but Korean people are so nice as in other areas. You can practice some of your bargaining skills.
181,4.0,"A bit of everything from inexpensive food to bags to household stuff. Take time to walk through all the small lanes. There are a couple of money changers, so no worries of not having enough KRW to go around for your shopping. Try bargaining a little if you are serious in buying, they will agree at some point."
182,5.0,"Fun shopping of all kinds and deals can be found. Clothing carts are set up in the center of the street and usually range from 500-5000 won.  In the buildings that line the street are floors of just about anything you may think of purchasing for the hard core shoppers, Shop till you drop, then go back for more. To appreciate Namdaemun, one should plan on two good days and yes, check the schedule for night shopping. .Easy to get to by subway, cab, and bus. Just about the shopping area is a food lane where you can try one of the Korean specialities for a very reasonable price. Fun for the children too since they have toys galore. If you do not walk through all the floors of the buildings, you may have missed what you really need at home."
183,3.0,"Most of shops there are clothes made in china and korea. There are cooking utensils for sell too. Ones who are looking for korean cooking utensils like in korean drama series, you can find there. But I think they are pricy. The only things I can buy are dog dresses which are very cute."
184,4.0,"We visited the market, as it was near to the Namdaemun Gate. We spent an hour walking through the market, tasting pasties and buying souvenirs. It will require at least 1-2 hours to explore the market, and there are great souvenirs on display. We took Subway Line 4, Hoehyeon Station, exit # 4 to access the market.It was quite busy, but people were friendly and accommodating. It was easy to visit the stalls and shops, although the walkways were crowded. The prices of souvenirs seemed generally cheaper than at the major attractions, with the added benefit of being able to bargain. Most shop owners seemed to know a little English."
185,5.0,"I used to live in South Korea and I love shopping for Korean decorations. This is a great place to shop for Korean decorations, great gifts to give to friends and family. I can bargain the price in this market compared to shopping in boutiques and regular stores. I speak the language. So if you happen to come to this place and you want to bargain, just say: pisayo (expensive); and say hal il ha ship siyo (discount please) with a smile. Once you get the discount or a cheaper price never forget to say: thank you (Kamsa hamnida) with a bow."
186,3.0,"I'm not a fan of street markets. Really love to go just for the fun of watching how crowded the usually are. I liked more the closed by Myeongdong street shops. Sell almost the same things and is more organized. Overall this is one of the best street markets of Seoul. If you like street markets, then you shouldn't miss it."
187,4.0,I like it but so busy at night you can walk because many of people walking and some of them shopping.. you can buy new items
188,4.0,"Visited the market for a couple of hours and were overwhelmed with options.  Each spoke of the market emphasized a different product, clothing, jewelry, tourist quitch, and food.  Its a true market and you will find the deals of a lifetime.  Make time to visit."
189,4.0,Overwhelming amount of little stalls covering a large market place.  Fun if you like to shop local things.  Specific area sells specific items.  It feels like walking through a maze.
190,3.0,If you want a traditional market than you found it.  I didn't find any great deals.  So was not my cup of tea.
191,5.0,"This is your one stop shop for cheap clothes, souvenirs, and accessories. Namdaemun is a huge outdoor market with little stalls lining up to create a massive labyrinth near Seoul station. It's easy to spend a whole day here, you can buy a lot of things without breaking the bank. This is a place where you can barter. There's also an accessory wholesale market next door."
192,5.0,"A good place to get all sort of souvenirs from Korean culture at a very reasonable price.T-shirts, and pretty brooches are available at good bargains too! Other items are also available for spree such as home deco, kid toys & clothing."
193,4.0,"This is a big market place with rows and rows of shops and carts selling everything from clothes, shoes, local products, souvenirs to food. After walking around in this maze like place for a while, you realise that one alley is about the same as the next as the products kept repeating. Also, don't expect fashionable stuff here. The apparels are not expensive but they are also not trendy. Nevertheless, I enjoyed walking around to just soak up the atmosphere and feel the vibrancy of the place. After seeing streets after  streets of cosmetic shops at Myeongdong and every where else in Seoul, it is refreshing to see seaweeds and kitchen utensils."
194,4.0,The market place is huge. There are many alleys which leads you to different places of the market. You can see locals shopping there too. Many nice souvenirs and good snacks stalls in Namdaemun Market.
195,5.0,"The market is just across our hotel, so it's usually the first place we walk to. Plenty of clothing and accessories but you'll need to ""dive"" into the buildings instead of walking on the streets. Nice experience."
196,4.0,"Namdaemoon market is very old market in Korea. you can buy very old goods in Korea. but you can buy modern goods in Korea. This market is popular to all ages so If you go there There are always croweded all day because  chinese and Japanese peolpe enjoy to shoping in here. so Maybe You will can be hard and you have to be hardship. however In Namdaemoon market, You can do enjoy very fun shopping Because I think they sell almost everything for cheap prices. like clothes,  Household goods, toy, stationery, kind of like that .but the amazing thing is There are really many restuarants They dont sell only Korean foods chinese food Japanese food Thai food just They sell almost all around the food.but Iam not sure just They dont sell only Korean food.anyway If you want to go you should take a train and bus.  so then enjoy your trip"
197,4.0,"We went there looking for bargains and souvenirs to buy back from Seoul.  There was indeed a wide array of selection of items ranging from clothing, bags, ladies accessories and many little souvenirs.Be careful where you want to buy your stuff.  We bought quite a bit of souvenirs from the roadside stalls only to find out that we were charged double for similar souvenirs when bought from wholesalers shop further down the road.  We were a little upset at such discrepancies.  It wasn't a matter of 10-20% difference but doubled.  So go to wholesalers shop to get the best price.We did spend some time in the kitchenware merchandise.  It was really good quality and the prices are really much better than anywhere else you can get in Seoul.So be wise."
198,3.0,The only kebab shop in namdaemun. The seller today is not friendly at all. the price is 4000 won the cheapest. I told him to wrap the kebab after he already prepared it and he almost got angry at me saying why telling him now and not telling from the beginning. How do i know he is going to pack it like that if that was the first time i came here. Definitely wont come here to buy again. Totally disappointed.
199,3.0,"A recommended market to buy souvenirs, such as keychain, korea t-shirt, korean chopsticks and spoon, clothes, dried fruits and many more (if you have kids age under 7-8, there will be many clothes, especially for girl, many choices of design). Must try fruit is strawberry, really sweet and soft, also with very good price at Namdaemun (2,000-3,000 per box). Most of the sellers can not speak english or mandarin, so you have to take out your calculator to bargain. Be careful to bargain though, some sellers are very unfriendly."
200,1.0,"Bad bad experience from this market. 1st time to visit s. Korea and was advised by many to go shopping to this market. Just as we arrived and looking for things...this male owner of a store where he sells bags was so rude. We were just standing outside his stall and my 9 year old son was just looking at the bags all of a sudden he did a sign for us to leave his store..since he can't speak English. ..he drove us off in a very rude way like we were flies..shooo...shooo. I was very upset as we were tourist...after we left he did a ""f"" sign to us...so i gave it back to him. Found out that some of these business owners are bad to tourists especially if you are southeast asian. In short in this day and age...obvious descrimination in S. Korea still exists. When you came from a well diversified country...you just feel awful."
201,4.0,All around here most people are selling the same thing... you just have to choose and start your bargain... get snacks in bulk here too!
202,4.0,"It is a very big local market and basically you can find everything you need there, if you have the time to explore. From local foods, handmade jewelry, snacks and clothing, it gives a chance to observe the local trading life among locals. I would highly recommend to visit this place if you have a Korean guide with you, it may probably give you a relatively good deal especially F you could speak Korean."
203,2.0,"If you think you could find some Korean stuffs in this market, you are right but most of the things are sold in bulk. Unless you want 12 pairs of socks of the same kind, there is no point to go to this market. All products are Korean cheap copies of brand name luxury lines just change the logo tiny bit. Save your precious time for some other places in Seoul which you can see beautiful sight or learning a bit about their culture."
204,4.0,"This place is similar to Central Market in Kuala Lumpur but in a larger scaleThey had everything here if you want to find something budget but quality is okClothes, souvenir, food. You name it!"
205,4.0,"Visited Namdaemum Market with my 21 year old daughter just 10 days ago and had a great time just walking around the many stores selling clothing ( super cheap averaging 5000- 20000 won ) along the streets. Main point to note when visiting Namdaemum Market- There are HARDLY any toilets around here! If you need to visit the bathroom, try looking for an air conditioned building . There's a building selling all sorts of clothing for older ladies, didn't stay long as it was packed and prices were not cheap either. As well as a few selling household items . We had lunch at one of the food alleys and it was a simple fare of beef with vermicelli glass noodles in broth and abalone porridge. Taste wise - food was average tasting. Found this wonderful store selling freshly made steamed paus - these were filled with mashed red beans - very soft and fragrant - highly recommended! The store also had many fried dough fritters! Also a market selling fresh vegetables, dried goods and fresh fish! Great place to walk around - you really have to look at all the alleys to see the different vendors selling their wares, from shoes to housewares , stationary , clothes, fresh produce etc"
206,5.0,"An institution in Seoul and a must see. Lots of choice between food, souvenirs, bric a brac and ginseng. Market stalls encourage you to come in but there's no pressure. Very little room to bargain as prices are quite low already. Be careful of the motor bikes that do the deliveries in between the swarms of people. Great place to find value and pick up bargains. Some of the shops off the market were huge - we went into a stationery / toy shop and it was probably 4 floors. Went back again the next day so can easily spend half a day here."
207,4.0,"Like many of the markets here in Seoul, this is a truly unique and exciting experience. There are  number of ways to enter the market and all give you a fun view.  This market is overflowing with seasonal clothes on the main strip and all kinds of shops and restaurants in the alleys and the alleys off of the alleys. This is one of the fun clothing markets in Seoul. I recommend it and will definitely return to this market"
208,3.0,Visited in the morning.  Had breakfast at an alley selling knife cut noodles.  That was an interesting experience and quite delicious.We ventured into the basement selling all kinds of things from chilli powder to fabric and that was when we got totally lost and could not find our way out.  It was like a maze!
209,3.0,"We went to Namdaemun at around 6pm, not yet hungry but I'd say that was a good thing, this market is kind of run down, sells a lot of pseudo fake products, various ginseng, clothing, limited street food, was really missable compared to other areas nearby."
210,5.0,"Really buzzy and safe to visit. Great street food and shops. Coffee shops abound in Seoul, it has the most of any city. Shopping opportunities are really good and prices excellent for a capital city. Easy to get to in the subway."
211,3.0,"Used to get good deals here long ago. No bargaining now and shop keepers raise their prices when they know you are tourist. Not much traditional crafts to be bought here anymore. Mostly flea market type clothing, bags, shoes, sunglasses, hair accessories. If you want to see what a traditional market used to look like this is it. Beware of your wallet and purse."
212,5.0,Bought souveniers here for my family and the prices are really cheap compared to other tourist places eg:Itaewon. Can get good bargain and its good to bring calculator if u dont speak korean. The sellers are very nice too.. Really enjoyed my time here. Pls take note they close at 5pm..
213,3.0,Avoid going there if you dont like overly crowded places. Things here are not exactly cheap as they say. It is definitely popular among the locals and the tourists but didn't work for me. There are endless options to eat and shop and wander around. Good place if you're looking forward to purchase souvenirs. Good luck!!! :)
214,4.0,"This is a fairly big street market with lots of things to buy!!!  There's food stalls, restaurants, clothes vendors, souvenir vendors!!! You name it, it's all there!!!  Enjoy!"
215,5.0,"you can shop for anything and everything you wantyou can also eat here and try the food alley - reasonable and home cooked tastewe went here twice, on a weekend and on a monday. less people on a weekday which is good :-)sellers are also friendlier than i expectedtourist information officers are also available in the area so they can help you out"
216,5.0,"Cheap shopping, bargains. Not solace for couture shoppers. Street Food stalls and lots to look around and take in. Great time for anyone wanting to just go walking and wandering."
217,4.0,"The place is near Hoehyun Station.  The place is huge and can easily get lost.  The place sells mostly local stuff of all sorts.  I especially like the fresh street buns there.  It tastes like Chinese meat buns and dumplings but the one with vegetable has Kimchi in there and all the buns are so delicious.  We went for the buns twice!  In fact we'd prefer the buns than the hotel breakfast.  Also we love the waffle and Americano (coffee) in a modern coffee shop there.  It is a good place to see this important part of Seoul and to know a little about the lifestyle by experiencing the market.  I will visit again if I ever go to Seoul again.  There are children's toys in Namdaemun market but they are not the type you expect from ToysRUs.  I find that for shopping, the market is similar to China because most of the stuffs are from China.  So do expect that when shopping there, but it's good to have a look no matter what."
218,4.0,"The usual fare you would expect from a market, food, clothing, souvenirs... Lots of foods to enjoy. We spent around 2hrs here just wandering and sampling."
219,4.0,Cheap shopping. Still you can get to buy the same items at insasong and myeondong with the same price.
220,3.0,"Being from Asia myself, this market did not appeal highly for me. Street food looks good but I only got to try the hotteok. Found some nice backpacks but passed up on them. Found the same ones in Insadong for half the price."
221,4.0,"I stayed near (7 min. walk) Namdaemun market for about 4 days last year while on vacation in South Korea. We ended up going to Nandaemun every night to walk around. Every night we saw something different (we also visited once in the day and found a really good beef soup place). This is, simply put, a great place to eat, shop, and eat some more. Note that English is not widely used in South Korea (in my experience). However, we were surprisingly able to communicate in Mandarin with most vendors and most of the beauty supply stores. My mom was able to negotiate a little bit with each vendor (store or stall). However, I'm not sure what the standard is and how much you should expect to negotiate. Most of the stalls will not take credit card but most of the beauty stores will (and if you spend more than $30K KW, ask for a tax exemption receipt!)Note, if you walk by in the morning there are folks selling breakfast. Very good place to grab something to-go for later. My mom is not super abled physically but this place was flat enough that it was easy for her to get around. Plus, most of the food stalls/restaurants had seating, so there are place to sit and rest (provided you buy food and eat!)"
222,5.0,"Made a mistake to first visit in the night...its more happening in the day. I stumbled on this massive and bubbling market when I was looking around for the cable car to go up N Seoul Tower. We were drawn by all the sights and smell. It's a beautiful showcase of Korea's best in one place. Had a meal at one of the shops, reasonable and filling. Must go and with a good appetite."
223,5.0,My guesthouse very near to Namdaemun Market..just walking distance less than a minute. You may get a T-shirt (for souvenir) 3 for 10000 wonRecommended..
224,3.0,"This market has everything that you want to buy. We went here in the morning while some sellers preparing their things. We met some ahjumma's money changer. At one corner, you can find kalguksu. If you have time to look around, then this place is perfect for you. But if you don't have so much time, better don't go this place."
225,4.0,"get your usual tourist souvenir & stuff here..t-shirts, keychains & the like. may be a little expensive than similar markets elsewhere. good experience nonetheless. Surprisingly for Malaysians, some of the sellers can speak a little malay!"
226,4.0,"Having visited Myeondong, Insadong and Dandaemun  Market, we believe this is probably  the best and balanced market for tourist in terms of pricing and completeness. If you have very limited  time, this is the one you must do to complete  your Seoul trip. The sellers are reasonably  friendly, with one even brought me to public washroom (quite  a walk away from his stall) as I could not understand his English. Merchandise  include clothing and souvenirs, but not many food stalls. There are more street food at Myeondong  night market, however note that we visited  Namdaemun  on day hence this may not be fair comparison.Again, English is quite limited here, but we manage to haggle few thousand  wons off from some stalls. Tips: 1. Go for stalls for haggling as you have better chances there , harder to haggle at stores. Note that you need to pay cash for stalls. Prices we believe is lower than Insadong 2. Look  around deep into market before negotiating  for  price. Those stalls near the street usually  more  expensive  than  the one at center of marketSummary, great place to be in if you like street / flea market type of environment. Haggle if you like as that's would  be a nice experience  to try ☺in Seoul markets"
227,4.0,Good place to get local goods but you need to bargain. There nice and trendy stuff to buy there but most of the retailers don't speak English although some spoke mandarin. We bargain using the calculator and there was no issue at all.
228,3.0,Market opens till 5am so does sone nearby shopping Centres.  Famous for its stalks n street food. A must try.  Can get most suff 'tourist' would want.  Be prepared to walk.  Women's clothes abounds.
229,2.0,"Made a special trip here on a Saturday night just to be told its closed.However, if you need Christmas supplies the Christmas decorations stores are 24 hours."
230,3.0,"Near to our hotel and therefore we went there few times.  Many stores and variety of stuff to buy.  Since is a must go place in Seoul, worth making a trip there."
231,4.0,"I have visited as a tourist and as a local and each time I was overwhelmed by the sheer size of this place. Easy to access on the green line but once you are in, be prepared to get horribly lost! Don't just stay at ground level - each building has 5 levels and each level has its own specialty.It will take days to see the whole thing. Lots of touristy stuff but lots fashion, jewelry and ginseng too. Found some amazing pottery."
232,4.0,"We had planned the visit to Namdaemun for the last day of our trip, so that we need not carry out purchases with us throughout.  Namdaemun is a large market offering a great variety of stuff, from kitchen/ household wares, clothes, food, bags, shoes, etc.  The prices are reasonable, nevertheless, one should still bargain.  As the place is quite large, comprising of different multi-storied buildings, alleys, etc.  If one has a specific item to look for, he/ she should approach the tourist information counter or persons dressed in red stationed at the junction of the market and ask for directions so as not to go round in the market aimlessly.  I am surprised and impressed by the availability and professionalism of such assistance.  However, it is noted that this market is more suitable for the more matured.  Younger teens might not find this place interesting and would still prefer Myeongdong more."
233,1.0,"I sometimes work out of an office building across the road from this place.There is nothing much to see, buy or eat. Consistently disappoints everyone who visits. Tourists have this idea that this place is somehow representative of the 'old' Korea. It isn't. Move on."
234,5.0,"There is plenty of shops within the market and they range from clothing, accessories, shoes, food, ginseng etc."
235,1.0,"Went there late night, and were utterly disappointed by the inflated prices set for foreigners. With such strong reputation, I personally believe they should improve many things from shops to attitude. Once they know you are a foreigner, be sure to be hacked. Do bargain if something really catches your eye. Would never come back to the market, especially the whoesale area. Expected much better quality and experience, terrible experience. Really sad to know of this fact"
236,3.0,"My girlfriend found a few things she liked for rather low prices (we just came from Japan, so everything seems cheap here). For low quality clothes it is a good place, but I didn't found any souvenirs I liked. I expected the market to be much bigger, but within an hour or two we saw most of it."
237,4.0,"A vibrant bustling marketplace with lots of different shops and laneways to explore. Namdaemun is more rustic than Myeongdong, so don't go expecting bright lights and trendy interiors."
238,4.0,"This market is very friendly and has all sorts of typical Korean produce and souvenirs but at a good and often negotiable price! You can buy numerous traditional teas like jujube and ginseng for example and also parasols, fans, chopsticks, bags, pottery, jewellery, clothes. It is a non-threatening environment and you can also get cold drinks, smoothies, fresh juices, etc. there."
239,5.0,"Loved this market.  Such a variety of goods can be found here - clothes, household products food, paper products, jewelry craft making supplies, hair accessories - you name it, it's here.  During Christmas, there are even ""western"" Christmas decorations. Parking is available and not too expensive but we usually walked there from post.  It's uphill from Yongsan but downhill when your backpack is full of goodies. Lots of inexpensive clothes on tables if you don't mind digging.  Slightly more expensive stuff is folded or hanging up.  If you have time, a must see to experience.  And yes, you can haggle at the outdoor stands, not so much in the fixed clothes stands."
240,5.0,"you cant finish to shop in one day,there are every kind of goods,and so many shops in building.only dissapointment is this market close veryearly unlike other korean market"
241,4.0,"If you want local korean items & traditional ones, visit this market.It is cheap and you can bargain also."
242,5.0,"Very good collections of clothes, gifts etc. Return home like a Korean, by dressing Korean. I don't mean the traditional way, but the latest style as seen in K-pop."
243,4.0,"I have been here with my mum, she is not a big fan of shopping but even she thanked me for taking her here. You can find everything you can imagine, with good price. Especially traditional korean gifts are the best of quality and price. You can buy amazing bookmarks for 1000-2000won, which are 10.000won at the airport! You can haggle with some of the shoppers but mostly they don't welcome especially if you are not paying cash."
244,4.0,"Namdaemun market was an interesting place to visit. We walked 400 meters west from the Seoul central train station up the hill and found this market by dead reckoning. It was not very crowded on a Sunday afternoon, but that may because of the current MERS scare. The market had a little something for almost every age group. Leather goods, fabrics, clothing, sunglasses, food, etc. It'll be a great place to go get gifts for birthdays and Christmas."
245,3.0,Crowded streets with tons of shopping for everyone. They have little street shops and indoor markets. I buy blankets in Korea because their cotton is unbelievable. The food is fresh and delicious and won't disappoint.
246,4.0,"The market is quite a maze.  I've been there several times but I still get lost.  Ask for a map at the information kiosks if you want to keep your bearing.  We went mostly for the cheap eyeglasses and we were not disappointed.  I stay away from the first floor shops since they seem to be more expensive than the second floor shops.  I'm not sure though if they are able to speak much English.  We got 5 pairs of teen and children's eyeglasses for 50,000 each including eye exam, frame, and lenses.  They finished it less than an hour.  While we were waiting for my pair, we browsed around and had lunch at a kalguksu restaurant which was very good.  We also saw Running Man t-shirts at 3 for 10,000 so grabbed 6 of those.  If you are able to go to other markets for food, you should go there instead.  They don't have as high of a quality for dried squids, etc. as the Jungbu Market."
247,5.0,"Full of shops and local food. I you are adventurous to explore local essence for place, this the way to go.This place is quite difference than other places in world in sense of locally made material. Authentic Korean made stuff with reasonable price is available here unlike any other tourist city where you would find things made of China.I would recommend couple of things here :1) Visit flower market, amazing verities.2) Check ornaments, hand bracelets (handmade)3) Souvenirs made of sea shell (specialty of Korea)4) Local foodIt would take whole 1 day if you would like to enjoy.Regards"
248,2.0,"HUGE market and cheap items. From clothes, bags, shoes, everything almost here and are cheaper compare to Myeongdong and Dongdaemun. However, place is not clean and some sellers are rude. We experienced being pushed for just standing next to her stall (we were just checking our maps). Sorry, not really a good experience for me. But it doesn't mean everyone's like that. Love the people here, I love the smiles on their faces.Tips:- Try to bargain if you are buying many items from one store.- If the seller already agreed to your asking price, buy it right away. Not nice to haggle, then you turn your back. Some shoppers are like this, and sellers are unhappy.- Learn simple Korean like asking for price (igeo eolmayeyo = how much is this?). Most cannot understand and speak English.- Women's apparel are on west side of the area. Check your maps and train stations exits so you'll not get lost. Hard to rely on maps on this area."
249,4.0,"I usually don't enjoy too much these traditional markets. I'm not so much into buying too much souvenirs, and traditional markets are usually the place to find tourists, rather than Korea people actually shopping. However, Namdaemun still was a pleasant experience for me. First, there are actually quite a few locals going about their shopping, so it doesn't feel too much like a tourist trap. Also, as I stated, I don't usually enjoy traditional markets that much, but for someone enjoying them, they've come to the right place, as the place is exactly what you could expect, selling all sorts of products at an affordable price. But what leads me to rate this place 4* instead of 3* is the size of the market. Many tourist markets around the world are one big street with a way in and a way out. Namdaemun however, takes out an entire neighborhood, with entrance doors on all sizes. It's really gigantic and one could easily get lost there. The market also includes huge buildings, each large, with many floors, and some of them connected via catwalks. There is truly an amazing variety and quantity of goods available for purchase at a fairly affordable price, and shopper enthusiasts could spend an entire day there without being able to get a full view of what Namdaemun has to offer."
250,4.0,"A big place that sell textiles and range of clothing. I really fancy the seafood just outside the market because it is really cheap, fresh and tasty. Visit namdaemun market can sum up visit to other market except myeongdong. All in all, i recommend this place."
251,5.0,"This is the place to go for all the cheap stuff. Most are probably made in China. But if you want to get t-shirts for 3 for 10000 won or 1000 won socks, this is better place to shop. Just like Myeongdong, lots of street food. It's fun just to walk around and see their average Korean market day. Also very clean and no gutter smells."
252,5.0,"Excellent spectacle frames.  Compared to U.S., lighter and more stylish at less than 100 dollars.  I recommend Hanaro optical by Gate 5.  Would defer the lens prescription to my local home optical though.Excellent hanboks for children, lacquerware, and comforters.  High quality lacquerware with mother of pearl inlay jewelry boxes from 15 to 300 dollars-- equivalent to those sold in Insadong for at least half off.  Toddler hanboks for less than 70 dollars the going rate retail.  I recommend building C, 2nd floor.I went by myself and compared prices with locals who said I was not ripped off despite being a terrible bargainer."
253,5.0,"- delicious street foods such as the seaweed love letters, black sesame pancake and ice creams- cheap but beautiful knitted sweaters and cardigans- quality and affordable brooches- my must visit place whenever I comes to seoul!"
254,3.0,"Coming from the Philippines, I could compare this to Divisoria or Baclaran. No branded items, daily necessities, clothes, shoes, socks, you need it, you'll find it there. Food stalls are everywhere as well. This market is worth a visit."
255,4.0,"Like any large city, Seoul has many dichotomies and one of them is the new and the old...perhaps a better description than ""old"" would be ""original"".  Like all things new, there is comfort and orderliness but it lacks the all important ""flavour"".  That is not the case with Namdaemun Market, it has flavour in spades.  Namdaemun is the historical southern gate to Seoul.  So you can well imagine the congregation of sellers and buyers that would gather here to transact over hundreds of years.  The corridors are narrow and lined with independent merchants operating small stalls.  Merchants selling similar items tend to congregate in one area, fruits and vegetable, dry food items, clothing...etc.  Casual eateries dot the market throughout.  Some of them are very good offering traditional Korean fast foods like noodles, steaming broth soup, dumplings and other delicacies.  It is an experience!  Well worth spending half a day just wandering through the many corridors.  And if you tire, you are just a few blocks away from something modern."
256,5.0,"This market is so much fun!  EVERYTHING is for sale here and at a pretty good price.  From housewares to snacks to beautiful clothing and it's EVERYWHERE.  Be sure to give yourself lots of time to explore this maze of a market and don't worry about getting turned around, it's not that hard to get your bearings once you find a main road.  Come hungry, the food is excellent!"
257,4.0,Spent a day wondering around the market and underground stalls. Try the food places in the middle of the market.... really good food and really cheap.
258,2.0,"Most of the women who sell jewelries at Lengdang market (is that how it's spelled?) are extremely rude.They gave me and my sister dirty, angry looks when we asked how much they cost and answered in a rude way. Perhaps it's because we are from Malaysia, a third world country, so we disgust them. :(Also, a lot of jewelries are for wholesale, and when I wanted to buy in bulk so I can make a little extra income by selling the rest at home later, they said that it takes a week to make them. Of course, there are some ready made bulks but they aren't as pretty as the ones you need to pre-order first."
259,4.0,We were staying in a hotel which was not far away from Namdaemum Market and therefore we got there on foot.  Namdaemum Market is a good place to enjoy Korean cuisine as there are a number of restaurants which sell traditional Korean food.  Don't worry about language barriers as some of them have both English and Chinese menus.  Some restaurants put their food on the tables in front of their doors and therefore you may have some ideas about what to have before walk in.  Some food stalls open at night in the market and they sell Korean barbecue food which is part of Korean culture.  We had barbecue for dinner there to experience how Korean people live.
260,3.0,"The street market here is nothing great. But if you are looking for bargains and not too bothered about quality or brands, this is the place to shop. The market is divided into different sectors selling different products such as sportswear, women's clothing, children's stuff. Lots of street food here to try too. Personally, I'm not impressed by this place."
261,2.0,"We 1st went there on a Thur night (8pm) and the place was deserted.  Not sure why but perhaps the market is closed on certain days.  We went back again on a Friday evening (9pm) and the situation was not much better.  Some sellers were already starting to pack up their stuff (at 9pm on a Friday night?) The food stalls looked interesting but we did not try them. The clothing and misc. souvenir products (e.g. fridge magnet, pouch, chopsticks) sold there were mainly made of poor quality and not quite worth the price.  Some of the stalls owners weren't very friendly either. However, we did managed to purchase some delicious dried squid and preserved persimmon from one of the tiny shops in the vicinity.  They weren't cheap though. I find other Asian street markets in places like Taipei and Bangkok much more interesting. We left Namdaemun Market and walked to Myeongdong, which was much more exciting and buzzing with people. However, I didn't see many souvenir shops / stalls at Myeongdong.  If you want mass produced, run-of-the-mill type of Korean souvenir, Namdaemun may be a better bet.  If you are looking for something more refined and unique (e.g. handmade art pieces), check out Insadong or Buckhon."
262,3.0,"Went on 01 Jan 2015. Quite a number of stalls were closed. Stall owners were not friendly at all. Hard sell, no discount, Do not speak common language. Anyway, walked further down, the stuffs get slightly cheaper. Would prefer the underground shopping mall where prices are stated. Not really cheap for shopping, if ones have been to Bangkok, Taiwan, etc..."
263,4.0,"It was slightly snowing when we went.  The place were awfully crowded.  Small shops lined the streets.  Many smaller stalls filled up the space in the centre portion.  Souvenirs, winter wear, shoe-shops, accesssories, street food, everything you could think of, were there in those many shops and stalls.Haggling was possible.  All eight of us ended up with new winter boots/shoes^^  Price was reasonable (my husband bought a pair of good winter boots for KRW55,000 while I bought a humble pair of winter shoes for KRW30,000.  My daughters' boots were about KRW45,000 each).  One downside was that the shopkeepers all couldn't speak English.  We had to use a calculator to communicate.On the whole, I'd recommend tourists to visit this busy area.  There's so much to see and buy."
264,4.0,"Our family with two young kids walked around here. We enjoyed trying the street foods. Market stalls have clothes, blankets, knockoffs, foods.  We saw a stall with tourist items but they were so over priced it was ridiculous. The streets are clean and sellers don't push you to buy."
265,3.0,"We went to Namdaemun Market after Insadong and Myeongdong Markets so we had ""market-overload.""  There is nothing great about the market except for its wide variety of socks.  But if you love to buy socks for everyone back home, this is the place.  There are many types of socks for a very cheap price ($1 a pair).  The bags are also cheap ($10) in a lot of different styles.  It can be crowded too."
266,5.0,Love to go and get lost here! I always see something new. Great place to find souvenirs and traditional Korean ware.
267,4.0,There are basically hundreds of shops here. Try to bargain when you shop. Some shops will lower the price if you bargain. Try the extraordinary experience in dining at the food alley. We tried the one near Hoehyeon subway exit 5 which is called Kalguksu alley.
268,4.0,"Lots of tourist-y shopping and also local shopping here. Many stores have the same items for sale. You can get better prices inside the buildings up on the 2nd or 3rd floors, sometimes for 1/2 or even 1/3 the price available on the street. Be careful because the streets are a maze of twisty little passages all alike. Be sure to check out the funny ice cream cones and the candy that looks like shredded wheat, but is made from honey and rice flour."
269,4.0,"I came here a couple times for short visits and wish I'd had more time. Lots of different types of souvenirs if you are looking for that kind of stuff. I'm not a big bargainer, so I overpaid, but should I go again, I'm ready to bargain down! There is good street food and lots of shops. We didn't even see them all. If I ever make it back to Korea, I plan to return here, even though I don't even like shopping."
270,4.0,We went to this place for couple of times to buy beauty products and souvenirs.Best place in Seoul to buy souvenirs with very cheap price.
271,4.0,"One could easily get lost in this market with thousands of stalls. We were walking down one lane/ street, browsing at the stalls and then we saw a door thinking it is leading to a shop but it actually leads into another maze of vendors. Many of the tourist maps have an insert map of the market which helps. It is so interesting. You can get anything here. Although we only bought some cheap souvenirs, there is an incredible amount of clothes, bags, food etc on display. It really is a great experience even if you don't purchase."
272,4.0,"This was fairly busy. We went on May 1 which was a holiday-Labour Day, we were expecting it to be busy. I would not want to come on a Saturday. I am sure it would be crazy. There were many items for sale in ""bulk"", finding lower numbers was difficult.  There was no bartering evident. The price was the price. They didn't offer a lower price for items. If you were showing interest.  The stats on this place are amazing, 10000 vendors, 300000 to 500000 visitors daily.  The delivery methods for goods were incredible (older men with frames on ropes carrying 6-8 boxes) and the carts and motorcycles navigating.The market hours are only 11am to 3 or 4pm, no Sundays.  So much stuff here for such short hours. Lots of food too."
273,5.0,"The shopping experience itself was OK, but one can find all sorts of street food vendors all around the market. From noodles, to red bean congee (sorry don't know the proper name), to all sorts of deep fried meat sticks and pastries, this is a great place to find and enjoy authentic Korean street cuisine.A key is to go to the vendors where you see the locals lining up - some of the lines for the fried dough stuff with kimchi (again, sorry I don't know the proper name) were quite long! Definitely worth the wait though."
274,5.0,"This place has so many types things to buy. We winged and and were walking in the market for about 5 minutes when we started to wonder why there were so many baby-clothing (aside from all the food, of course). There weren't many kids, but there were a lot of old ladies. If you're hungry, you should go to where they crowd, because those would be the cheapest and yummiest food there. I tried the noodles and red bean deserts. It was quite an interesting experience. I had a great time."
275,4.0,"All kinds of stuff in small shops along a labyrinth of small streets. Some large wholesale areas that don't do retail sales but majority do. Fairly good quality clothes, accessories, bags, shoes etc at cheap prices. Be ready for friendly bargaining and you can make a decent buy.Good roadside food shops with some delicious Korean snacks spiced up our visit too."
276,5.0,"Compared to Dongdaemun, I prefer Namdaemun market. I went there twice,.. searching for goods, clothes, cheap shoes, sweater, jeans, bag, school bag bought there for my son for 18,000 won. Shoes for my son only 28,000 won, we can asked for less, but must show your love and friendly to the ahjumma,.they will give less if they like your way of interacting with them, like me, I got 28,000 won compared to 48,000 won at the beginning... JUST SMILE AND BE FRIENDLY!.tHERE ARE MANY THINGS, GOODS, CLOTHES CAN BE BOUGHT FOR THE CHEAP PRICE, REALLY CHEAP,.NOT LYING.... THE BEST PLACE FOR SHOP FOR ME,... I WILL GO THERE AGAIN FOR SURE IN MY NEXT SUMMER VISIT!!!......."
277,3.0,Came in mid morning and started to push inside but with kids with us we decided to walk around the fringes towards to Myeongdong there are a lot things to see but mostly for local residents for they can't understand much English and if your brave enough to plunge inside the market don't forget to bring a calculator to bargain with and a ready smile. It really helps to smile and usually you get your price or a little higher.
278,5.0,"Found things here cheaper than most shopping place in Seoul!There were Guides in Red to help-especially when your little tot wants a bathroom!  Manage to get 10,000 won winter jackets!"
279,4.0,"There were clusters of shops selling like items... e.g. gift wrappers in bulk, jewellery boxes/pouches in bulk, fashion accessories which you must purchase in bulk (at least 5 pcs) etc.  I got some hair accessories which were of good quality, but a bit pricey... most of the shopkeepers' seems to ignore tourists... so I just buy without bargaining...This is not a place to look for fashionable items though."
280,4.0,"If you are looking for great deals on clothes, hats, nicknacks, etc.  This is the place to go.  If you are going in December there are several shops that sell holiday decorations.  I gave it a four because of the amount of people in this place.  I am not fond of crowds.  If you want to wade through a crowd of thousands of people to get some great deals this place is for you."
281,4.0,"We visited Namdaemun market twice during our 6 day stay in Seoul.It was more crowded in the late evening with more stalls&shoppers compared to our visit the next day in the morning.There were tonnes of souvenirs to bring back home such as purses,keychains,pens,t- shirts,nail clippers,fridge magnets etc.The sellers are well-mannered but don't expect to haggle for the price.Most of the prices are fixed but if you buy a lot of items,sometimes they do give you a minimal discount.Besides the souvenir shops&stalls,you can also find clothes,handbags,ginseng,scarfs,toys&lots of street food.The location is also very strategic since it is just walking distance from Myeongdong&right beside the well-known Shinsegae Department Store.So after experiencing the hustle and bustle of the market,you can easily find some cool&comfort at Shinsegae.Namdaemun market is a place worth visiting for every tourist in Seoul."
282,3.0,So so it seem like anther maket.ppl can't speaking English well if they can speak the price is not good to buy anymore
283,5.0,"this market is a real one stop market, you can find anything in this market, foods, souvenirs, clotches, umbrellas, etc, the area is walkable also from major shopping distric area. location is walkable from myeongdong. i bought many souveniers, seaweed, clotches and umbrella from this market only. most of all is this place offer you a cheapest rate rather then other market, even if you compared with myeongdong street market. i feel so happy to explore and shop in this market.if you travel to Seoul, this market is recommended to do your shopping. happy shopping!"
284,4.0,"Went here to buy trail mix nuts and left with a whole lot of loot! Best place to buy souvenirs (Korean spoons, ref magnets, keychains, shirts, etc). Wholesale price and you can even request for additional discount. Local sellers are nice and helpful."
285,5.0,I always make this a priority everytime I visit Seoul. Fantastic Bargains and a real buzz...bartering is a must.
286,4.0,"very good place to shop.....you can find so many things at cheap price....many items are sold from the lowest won5000. i bought ahjumma cap at won5000 only as a souvenir. it's one of the MUST BUY item when you visit seoul...also the korean long spoon, fridge magnet and the I Love Korea T shirt. you have to come at least twice to explore the place because the market is so big and got many sections. very easy to find the place if you go by subway....if cannot, also can take a taxi. next time when i visit seoul, i want to make sure i spend times to go to all the shops here."
287,4.0,"This is a place that I would recomend for people who are traveling with friends or going solo rather than families (unless the children are atleast 12). This is because of the fact that little children who don't know this area could lose their parents. But it is a fun place to look around for small little gifts as souveniers. There's quiet a lot to see and eat for somewhat cheaper prices. But be careful when buying something when you have little to no knowledge of Korea. Shop owners may try to increase the price if you aren't a Korean (like myself), so try to look around first to figure out the prices and bargain as much as you can. But be warned, we Koreans aren't very patient people. So if you take too long the shop owners may get angry."
288,4.0,"A friend of mine who lived in Korea for two years emailed me when she found out I was visiting Korea and said I must not miss Namdaemun market which is one of her favorites. So when we got to Korea, it was one of the first places we had to visit.When we got out of the exit, there were stores inside the metro that had really good designs for clothes. My cousin bought a Burberry (imitation of course) outfit which was 38,000 won and she was able to bargain for 20,000 won. That's almost half the price. From that time on, we just split the cost in half and sometimes you'd get it sometimes you don't. If you like it, buy it because it's hard to go back. The first time we went, there were some stuff we didn't buy. When we got to our hotel, we regretted not buying it. So we went back. However, it was very difficult to find the stores because we weren't coming from the same direction. Then when we got there, they were closed on Sunday. They were one of the few stores closed on Sunday. When my sister and cousin went the third time, they couldn't find the store. Lesson learned: buy it when you like it. There may be no next time. Also, you will be spending again for taxi or the metro and you could have gone somewhere else instead of returning again and again.There are many things to get here and we bought clothes and slippers and facial products. BB cream is one of the most inexpensive to buy in Korea. The Missha bb cream that I buy in the USA for $45, was only $11 here! I could have four BB creams instead of 1. So this is a bargain. I also like the BB Boomer. It will make your skin glow like the Koreans. It's also cheap here. We also enjoyed the slices of very cold watermelon for 1,000 won and very sweet pineapple slices of 2,000 won. The sweetest pineapple I've ever had. On a hot summer day, this was such a refreshing fruit to eat. We couldn't really see fruit stands in Seoul. They only had street food vendors at night. We had the dukboki since it was the only street food I saw at night. They also had fritters that went with it. For 5 selections, it was fried and cut up and tossed with the dukboki. The price was 2,500 won and it's very filling. They also had chicken bbq for 2,000 won. It had some spicy marinate but not overpowering. If you like mild spicy, this is for you!When we were leaving, we asked for directions from the vendors of the clothes we bought and they happened to be closing. We told them we wanted to go to Insadong. They didn't really speak English but they understood where we wanted to go and the three of them said and motioned to us ""follow us!"" When we got off, they pointed to where we should take the metro to go to Insadong while they merrily went their own way. How kind and hospitable can Koreans get? Going around by metro and bus for first timers who don't speak Korean is NOT a problem in Korea. Young and old alike will try their best to help you. And even when you're not asking help, someone will tap your shoulder and motion for you to follow them. I met a Korean lady on my way back to the USA. She told me that what Koreans do is go to Gangnam district, like Garosu-gil or Chamdamdong and look at the outfits there. Then go to Namdaemun or Dongdaemun markets and see if they have it here. Some of them will likely be here at a much better and inexpensive affordable price. And she said if you want to bargain, don't use the word ""discount."" Just say ""Is it ok to give it to me for this price?"" And say it sweetly and it's more likely that they will give it to you if you tell them this. I wish I knew this before I went to Namdaemun market. They have a ""free size"" so you'll have to figure out if it will fit you. If not, you can give it as a gift to someone you like.Take notes of directions and where you get off. It's really hard to go back here. It's just too big and there are many ways to get here."
289,3.0,"The Namdaemun market is another not to be missed ""Things To Do in Seoul"". The stalls are packed so close to each other in some parts and congested. There are 2 sides of this market, the outdoor market and the indoor market. Here you can anything you want, clothes, shoes, souvenirs, jewelry, kitchen pots, plates, bags, etc. However you must be adventurous to walk to the in-between lanes to get to other parts within the market. You can spend a good 3 - 4 hours if you explore and take time to look around the market. It's quite easy to get to this place and there are different gates in which you can enter, so look out for the entry gate. In case you think you are lost there are information or tourist counters around and they can tell you.I found the place to be interesting though I am not a keen shopper"
290,4.0,"The Namdaemun market was quite big. At some point we don't know where we're heading. They're several entrance to the market. We have to bargain to get a good price & the bargain experience was quite nice. There's a lot of stuff to see & to look. The flee market outside was nice but with children not recommended to go into big store's which was quite packed with people.  Unfortunately for me, if i convert the price to RM (Malaysia) the items were not that cheap. We bought a lot of the cutlery here with cheap price. But you need to find the correct shop. Try to find a side street temporary shop for great bargain. Language was a problem sometimes & makes the sellers not intend sell to you.   Tips : Buy souvenir here & cutlery. Cheaper compared to other areas.Always bargain 20% less or more"
291,4.0,"Namdaemun Market is a large traditional market in Seoul, South Korea. The market is located next to Namdaemun, the ""Great South Gate. Great for souvenirs. Haggle but don't offend the shopkeepers"
292,5.0,It's one of the best place to buy clothes in the world. You can buy sleek design clothes for the people of every class at a resonable price. There are many torists attractions hereabouts.  Don't miss the taste of traditional local food after shopping here.
293,5.0,"The food, the souvenirs, the smell, the haggling.....streets and streets of vendors with their goods.  There are also a few indoor markets, reminding me of the Silk Market in China except there is everything.  We bought amazing outfits for my baby granddaughter, sunglasses and a hoodie for my grandson, my daughter got some shirts....and I got a hat and fresh pineapple.  They have anything you need, and you can haggle if you want (which is what makes it fun).  You shouldn't miss this experience if you are in Seoul."
294,3.0,we went in the Seoul city tour since it was very early in the morning shops were not open we went again in the afternoon. Good shopping area food is tastier and cheap. Some clothes are cheap but most are on the upper scale price list. Look carefully they say those are Korean made but I found those bags are Chinese made. Some bargain is necessary.Worth for a shopping tour.
