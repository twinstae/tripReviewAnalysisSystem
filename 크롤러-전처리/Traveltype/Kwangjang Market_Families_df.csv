0,5.0,"Delicious netflixfamous Mungbung pancakes, steamy hot knifecut noodles from the netflixlady, dokkbokki, soondae, soju, streetfood between locals at its top with heatwarming seats"
1,4.0,We went on New Year’s Day so only the food stalls and a few snack and clothing stalls were open. The oil stench was strong from all the mug bean pancakes and there are dozens of stalls selling pretty much the same thing but we were too I adventurous to sit down especially when we have just had lunch an hour before that. The last thing you want is to horde a couple of seats and not consume enough.
2,4.0,The market was an interesting experience to see and try out the korean street food! It is a bit crowded especially around lunch and dinner time but I think it’s worth visiting. Make sure to try the food there!!
3,4.0,worth a visit to check out the food. didn’t spend that much time here but my favourite stall was the kalguksu (knife-cut wheat flour noodles in soup) and mandu (dumplings) stall made famous by the netflix street food show (happy to report that it is worth the hype and the possible wait for seats as it’s now a hot spot for foreigners thanks to the show). it’s also a good place to shop for fabrics if that’s what you’re looking for!
4,4.0,Big markets. Lots and lots of stalls. Dry goods. Cooked food. Textiles. Linen. Toys. Souvenirs. Korean craft.  Good to explore especially during rainy day since it is covered. The textile sections on ground and upper floor is enough to make you lost. All good price. Don’t miss out the food stores. We had the noodle and dumpling at one of the Netflix street food featured stores. Not disappointed.
5,1.0,"Went with my brother to have a good experience as seen online. One of the food stall owners was very pushy and persuaded us to sit down after saying she'd give us ""service"" (free food). We ate some and asked if we could take the rest of the food away as we wanted to leave quickly, still thinking it was ""service"". Also important to note I spoke Korean though I'm not 100% fluent. I was quite naive, and at this point she added more food that we didn't ask for. I then asked how much this would all be(as it was a lot for free food) and she told me it was 16,000won. I then felt pressured into paying because she purposefully gave us a lot of food without asking. The stall owner was very old and our Korean wasn't good enough to argue with her. My brother was also feeling sick. At the time, there were a lot of people as well as the weather being very rainy and humid, so we just wanted to get away as soon as possible. Make sure to be very firm with what exactly you want to eat and always ask straightaway as to how much the food will be or make sure that the food is still ""service"" if offered."
6,5.0,"If you love traditional Korean food, this is your heaven. Don’t miss the kalguksu stall owned and operated by Yoonsun Cho, covered in Netflix’s Street Food. Yum!"
7,3.0,"It's a nice traditional market to look and walk around, but the food section is very crowded and the food selections are actually very similar although there are many stores, and the food vendors would keep trying to sell you their food and may come off as pushy and aggressive which I really felt uncomfortable with. The food selections are mainly street foods such as tteokboki, mandu, fishcake etc, the mung bean pancake I tried was average."
8,4.0,"We came here for lunch and entered on the textile entrance of the market.  About halfway into the building is when we finally started to  see the food stalls.  The first stop was a fish  cake stall where we ordered two, each W1000.  Both came impaled on a stick along with a cup of broth.  Both types of fish cakes were decent and the soup was flavorful.We were still on the hunt for a good lunch spot when we came across a stand with a large photo of Netflix on it.  It turned out to be one of the vendors, Yoonsun Cho, showcased on an episode of Street Food.  It was food stall #70 and had one of the largest seating areas which was a stand-alone stall surrounding the cooking and prep areas compared to all the others we walked by.  We had to wait about ten minutes before a bench opened to accommodate the whole family.  During the interim we watched her make some of her hand cut noodles and prep a number of bowls.  Everything we tried was very good from the kimchi mandu to the hand cut noodle and the cold buckwheat noodles (we ordered spicy but it didn’t pack much heat).  Overall they ran a very efficient operation for the lines of people wanting to eat here and the food was reasonably priced at W5000 each for majority of the menu items.There also was a mung bean fried cake vendor featured on Netflix but we were too full to give hers a try.The market was crowded and together with all the frying the temperature got a little warm inside."
9,5.0,"I came here for some souvenir shopping which was very successful, but my mind was blown by the food court. I wish I had been as careful as I was with the souvenir shops, not buying at the first store because the deeper I got into the food court the better looking the food got, but I was already full! The fried pancake filled with pork, sold right in the crux of the market was delicious. My daughter and I had fruit slushes out on the street side, but had we stayed toward the middle there were many more flavors available. Great atmosphere and great prices. Not much bargaining going on."
10,5.0,"A MUST visit if you are into following media tracks such as KD drama and other popular places.  We went to this market to try NETFLIX handmade star :)The noodles were springy and yummy! The entire process can be seen right in front of you.  dumpling and noodle making. As simple as 3 cauldrons to cook everything to serve people who would wait in 3 layers behind the stools.We had the handmade noodles (5000Won) and the mixed dumplings (5000Won)Both simple but for some reason we ended up going back the next day to have it again.  Simplicity at it's bestNote the stall is near the south gate (stall # 70).  If there's something worthy to add, try to find the place along the middle of the walk way as everyone practically sells the same thing but it is only this stall who the overflowing customer (the magic of media).  this means the other stalls are not so keen in helping out find her.  before you leave, don't forget to buy some of the local KR crackers (Yummy) and kimchi - ALL TYPES! There are a lot of souvenirs too for giveaway though price is not that different from Myeongdon...maybe 100 to 200Won cheaper."
11,4.0,"Local market full with various local food. Price is not cheap but not expensive. Reccommend to walk around before make your decision because almost shops there have same food but some different menu. Not only food but have others like cloth, souvenir, etc."
12,5.0,"We went to Gwangjang Market in the morning. Lots of food stalls selling similar stuff. Tried the mung beans pancake and it’s delicious. We went in a group so that we can try a bit of this a bit of that as portions are big.There’s also live octopus... but we didn’t enjoy it so we didn’t order this time. Overall, good place to spend an hour or two."
13,5.0,"As I left the Shilla hotel I thought to check my walking itinerary for the day with the concierge and she recommended that while walking from ddp plaza to cheeong stream that we stop at this popular market. It did not disappoint. There is a gorgeous inner 2floor market for custom made Hanbok. This would be the place to go! We got to eat all of the night market street foods, did awesome souvenir shopping and we wanted to eat all here in this one market too."
14,4.0,"The market is one of the oldest and largest traditional markets in South Korea, with more than 5000 shops built around 1957 and 1959. Sells all food, house hold products at a very reasonable price."
15,4.0,"Took bus from MyeongDong to market for lunch and bought Korean snacks e.g. rice crispies mixed with honey and nuts, fresh rice cakes. Ate gimbap, raw octopus, crispy fried pancakes in one of the stalls. Squatted like a local to eat blood intestines, liver, lungs etc. Market specialised in selling blankets, fabric and winter blankets (which I was told can be vacuum sealed back home)."
16,4.0,Excitement in the air as this place is bustling with lots of activities. Good food as well! Highly recommend this place. A stall with a sign that says ‘Best Millet pancake in Korea’. Got to try .. locals Q for this food. I guess they can’t be wrong. stall is at the North 2nd gate. This is just one of the many good food in this place....
17,4.0,"Great market with many interesting selection of food although most sell the same items. You have to be here with empty stomach else is like walking in casino. Hope you can get the most yummy store! Please note that sun a lot of retail stores is closed, but crowded for the food alley :) Yum!"
18,3.0,"This is a good stop to finish your day, try some local food (and by this I mean what koreans eat everyday), and, in the meantime, do some bargain souvenir shopping.The place is crowded and you’ll have to navigate yourself trough people and stands, but, all in all, if markets are part of your interest, it’s worth a short visit."
19,4.0,This is a bustling market with may stall selling traditional South Korean dishes. It was a good experience. I realized though that the price per order are no cheaper than eating on the other restaurants that we've dined in.
20,5.0,If you don’t like being around a ton of busy people don’t go! It was fun and we saw so much! Plenty to eat and walking. It’s a must do.
21,4.0,"The market is very clean and easy to Find. The specialty is textiles, clothes and street Food specially mungo cakes and bibimbap. There Are a lot OF cheap winter jackets and bed warmers with rows OF stores selling different kinds OF textiles. But The highlight is The fresh lay cooked mungo cakes, bibimbap and to die fish soup. There are also live octopus sashimi but we didnot try IT."
22,4.0,"If you like Korean street food, this is the place to be. There are dozens of food stalls serving yummy Korean dishes like noodles, dumplings, bibimbab, raw squid, hundred types of kimchi, etc. It's fun to walk around and try different food. Souvenirs sold here are also cheaper. Behind the market is Cheonggyecheon stream where you can take a nice walk to burn all the calories from those delicious food."
23,5.0,We having a dinner here. There are some food is famous at the market and must try. You may buy some Korean snack there as it really cheap compare to other market.
24,4.0,"The Mung Bean Pancake is a Must Try. The Japchae (glass noodle), the pig's trotter and some other dishes are all over the food alley.Those stalls selling the Korean snacks are willing to go on bargains, esp. if a relatively huge amount of stuffs are bought. A friendly couple of this store even offered free yoghurt drinks to my kids and were happy to reduce prices with small free packs of snacks like seaweed in the bag"
25,4.0,"Seriously, I really though Seoul is all about hiphop, high end, classy stuff, but after my week long stay in Seoul, i realized that Seoul is really rather people city than the classy nature I thought previously.Gwangjang  market is truly a gem of what like really living in Seoul like, and how they enjoy so much in here as the food is good, cheap and come in huge variety.Please do come here early to start enjoying, as the crowd keep coming in endlessly...Have fun, its worth visiting and is FREE to do so .. :D"
26,5.0,"Spent a couple of hours wondering around with my family, stopping at various stalls to try the foods. Soups, dumplings, omelettes, noodles, fruit juices - and a variety of sometimes recognisable meat products. We saw most of it cooked before our very eyes.  It was so intense and jam packed with new sights and smells.  Absolutely worth a visit."
27,3.0,"Lots of food and wholesale stuff to buy. I am unsure if the prices are any cheaper but its a great experience. We bought some local snacks from the snacks stores. The hanboks there are really pretty, even for kids too. Worth the trip if you have something to buy."
28,5.0,"Great place to try all the different Korean street food, not for the people on diets. Also lots of good Korean products"
29,4.0,The market is very big full of street food and small restaurant.  Visiting in the afternoon is very hot in summer.  Visiting at night to taste the street food will be much more pleasant.
30,5.0,"Love this market! Apparently, this market is divided into sections, there is bibimbap section, hanbok section, etc. Market is clean and nice. If you like traditional market you must visit this place. They sell a lot of things, varieties of fermented goods (their fermented octopus kimchi is to die for), beautiful hanboks, korean cookware (that ramyeon pot you always see in k-dramas, stone pot for bibimbap,etc), food stalls (dumpling, pumpkin porrridge, mung bean pancakes, barley rice bibimbap, etc) and many more."
31,5.0,"Very nice visit; however, I wish I knew how to tell the street food ladies to only give a half portion or small portion. Many were confused when we were just sampling different foods and not finishing. We wanted to leave room for the next stop."
32,3.0,"Having seen the Gwangjang Market written up many places as somewhere you had to visit in Seoul, my family went for dinner.  We were very disappointed as it was much more intimidating than expected.  We had already been to many places to eat in Seoul and to various markets.  Gwangjang was among the most frenetic, crowded and dirty of them.  We were not inspired to eat there. Instead, we were more comfortable with the street food in Myeongdong.  I'm sure this is an instance of a difference in Western and Asian sensibilities, but I feel that Western tourists should be made aware that Gwangjang is not like anything you would be used to in the West."
33,4.0,Must visit this local Korean Market with varieties food and daily items can be found in this market.  You can experiences changing stall by stall tasting different local delicious as most stall have limited seating area.
34,5.0,"Most markets in Seoul offer the same stalls and after being to a few, it can be tiresome... except for Gwangjang Market! The food is real and local! The Mung Bean Pancake here rules its all! The Live Octopus is acquired taste but kids liked it!"
35,5.0,"The market has different sections selling different items so we went only to the food street to try their local delights.Had the mungbean pancake, famous donuts and also live octopus! Alot of their locals eat there, tourists were browsing more. Great local experience!Donuts were freshly made, located at the far end of the street. This stall is made famous as it has appeared on TV prog thrice! Be prepared to queue, but queue moves pretty fast. Go there n try for the local food experience and korean food culture! I went with a local guide so i did not have problems ordering food. But I realised that the hawkers are really friendly and welcoming unlike some local markets in other countries when you don’t speak their language. If you have time, do visit this food street!"
36,4.0,"A market serving Korean cuisine, selling Korean titbits and traditional costume. Came here to really enjoy the authentic Korean food. Don’t expect clean and nice restaurant. If you expect that type of standard then this is not a place for you. It’s really the sit at the streetside-hawker style of eating. There are plenty of tit bits to buy, ranging from ginseng sweets / dried seaweed to chocolates. Also ginseng and other products for making Korean soup. There is a segment with traditional Korean costumes and selling Korean textile and pillows/cushion. The market is structured with a few streets branching out from the Center. Each streets covers their on specialty too. This is also the place I had my fresh live octopus! It was yummy and fresh. Tried the raw beef too! There are also plenty of stalls selling noodles etc. You can also bargain at the titbits stall and costumes stall."
37,2.0,No very impressed at all... same kind of food in every stole ... was interesting to came there... but I wouldn’t came again and I wouldn’t eat in here again .... not worth it
38,3.0,"This place was recommended to me, but I thought it was just okay. If you're in the area, I would check it out, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it. There are a lot of markets in Seoul, and this one didn't seem special to me."
39,5.0,"I always enjoy visiting traditional markets wherever I visit. Gwangjang market is one such place definitely worth visiting in Seoul if one wants to have a true local experience different from upscale markets Seoul has to offer. Great place for those who want to try Korean street food delicacies. Good place to pick up few souvenirs too … we found a good shop where we picked up colourful silk bojagis - Korean wrapping cloth, which make a cool gift. There are several shops selling textile and we bought some Korean silk cloth for dress. Rest of the time was spent exploring all the local food and vegetables on sale all around! Very nice atmosphere to enjoy."
40,4.0,"The stalls are selling the similar foods ie pancake, seaweed rolls, noodles, dumplings, bibimbap etc. Must try the pancake! It’s tasty!"
41,5.0,"This is one of the oldest traditional markets in Seoul and is considered one of Korea’s largest traditional (and most beautiful) markets. I was recommended by the hotel’s Concierge to visit Gwangjang market if I am interested in authentic, local street food and window shopping for silk items and kitchenware (including utensils and cookware). At first sight, the market will look a mess but as you enter the maze of inviting stores.The food section of the market was further north with some food stalls entertaining snaking lines of up to 10 patience customers. I found myself a small seating spot and had the following for breakfast:   Topokki (Korean Spicy Rice Cake)   Japchae (Korean Glass Noodle Stir Fry)   Janchi Guksu (Korean Warm Noodle Soup)This is definitely a place I would live to re-visit if I was in Seoul again. Smelling, hearing, seeing, tasting and just being there in the middle of Gwangjang Market; doesn't get any better than that."
42,4.0,"Lots of food vendors option for you, taste is pretty much the same around here (it taste good) we didn't choose to sit at those vendors outside as there are too many people walking around and it bang our back. So we chose one of the restaurant with heater which we can rest and get warm with good food. They also have live octopus (Sanakji) at the Market, there is a shop located at the beginning of the street which i will not suggest you to go (sorry i forgotten the name, we went for the Sanakji randomly). Service is bad, there is no table for us and they ask us to sit outside with no proper table to eat, the octopus was stated 6000 won and they say they have, once we sat down they say that they don't have it. We felt cheated."
43,3.0,"Having grown up in Western countries, we could not eat anything there.  Lots of interns and food we are not used to. Maybe good for local Asian."
44,4.0,"This market is mainly fabric, linens, Korean Hanbok outifts and housewares. The food vendors are in the center of the market. There is row of all Bibimbap with heaping bowls of  vegetables. Then there are rows or vendors serving chicken feet, rice cake, kimbap and soup. The prices were reasonable and the food was hot. We tried just about everything. You could probably find just about any fabric here, even for suits. Bring cash for the food."
45,4.0,"This market offers both foods and garments, you'll realize most of the food vendors here offer almost the same food, and when you're here there's a few food you must try here, that is the beef tartare and live octopus cuts.for beef tartare, go to that restaurant that slices their beef fresh, you can see from outside the window, this restaurant serve live octopus as well."
46,4.0,"We visited this place at dinner time. This market offers a lot of local foods, from fried food, gimbap, oden, rice cake, sundae, and many more. The price is around 3000 to 5000 won. Be sure to sit on their stalls and point the menu that you want to eat. Otherwise they will give you a lot of foods, including the things that you don't order. To enter the food's section, you can take exit 8 from Jongno 5-ga station."
47,5.0,"Took the subway to this place. We enjoyed our visit here so much. We ate with the locals, we ordered Bibimbap rice , korean ramen and mandu and ate it in a crowded food stall where you sit side by side on a long bench. It was fun. We bought from every vendor we saw like the jap chae, mung bean cakes, gimbap, strawberries and rice juice. My daughter fancied the Korean made comforter and we ended up buying one. The korean ginseng is cheaper here so I bought some as well. If you are determined to buy yourself a hanbok better buy it here. They have different designs and sizes. Surprisingly, this market smells good and is not filthy for a fact that fresh and cooked food is sold at every corner. Our tummies and our shopping bags were full on our way home."
48,4.0,"We were able to buy cheap luggages, shirts and sweaters for cheaper price than when you buy somewhere else, it's also in great quality! WIN WIN! TIP: You should go here on your first day in SoKo, especially if you're looking for cheap sweaters and stuff. And go here if you wanna buy souvenirs and Kpop items."
49,5.0,"First time coming here to the market with the family. Love the whole market atmosphere. See all the food carts, especially the ahjummas selling bindaetteok. You can find all sort of food here, knick-knacks, souvenirs, and even clothes (at night)."
50,4.0,Most of the stalls were closed when we went on a Sunday morning around 10am. So it was rather quiet and didn’t really get to experience the real market atmosphere. The food stalls were open so we tried their mung bean pancake. Seems that different stalls sold different kinds. Try the Gimbap too! There were some stalls that sold kimchi that you can vacuum pack to bring back to your own country:)
51,5.0,"This is the traditional market where it have variety of foods, drinks, snacks, souvenirs, dresses and etc. Must try their mung bean pancake. We bought a lot of seaweeds and nuts as souvenirs from here. Some of the owner speak Chinese and English as well."
52,5.0,"This is as authentic a market in Seoul as it can possibly can be.  That it has become a tourist attraction with its own dedicated team of official guides is proof that this is no ordinary place despite its very ordinary setup.  Plenty of stalls to get your food, drink, souvenirs, fabrics and, our favourite item, the almond nuts.  The shopkeepers are a pleasant bunch, and they'll even throw you a special off-the-shelf item if you buy a lot (which we did) and they are, surprise, open to a bit of bargaining.  But I suppose its because we're tourists."
53,4.0,"This is one of the oldest traditional market in Seoul, and best place for tourist to come here for the korean street food. Bindaetteok (mung bean pancakes), Hotteok (pancakes with brown sugar filling), Tteokbokki (stir fried rice cakes), Gimbap (rice roll), Sundae (Korean Sausage) are few “must eat” food in this traditional market which you should not miss. It’s a place for you to experience local eating culture, and it’s conveniently located Exit 8 or 9 of the Subway Jongno-5 station."
54,5.0,"Pretty much only came for the food. Many to choose from! I had to have the sundae, kimbap and bindaetok which were all amazing"
55,5.0,"If you are looking for a traditional cultural feel,  this is the market to go to! Lots of interesting food stalls n food produce. Local Korea n products too!There are quite a few food stalls selling live octopus dish! Fun place to visit n experience for all ages!"
56,5.0,Got to this place to look for winter wear. We ended up with a big bag stuffed with winter wears all for just less then $200!
57,4.0,High quality korean silk. go straight to Hyun Woo Silk. bring your credit cards and cash. splurge. it's cheaper than in KL
58,3.0,Went to try all the food. Got pulled in a restaurant offering korean pancakes. Mistake letting the staff choose the stuff. Large portions and charge the earth. Think they pretend they did not understand when we ask for small portions. Eat at the stalls.
59,2.0,We went here to eat dinner. We were surprised that the area is dirty. It smells as well. We had to go around several times to find a clean restaurant. Food was not to our liking.
60,5.0,"There are many shops in this market, fruit stalls, vegetable stalls, clothings, bags, dried food products, traditional Korean wedding sweets, kimchi, shoes and culinary. There are also food stalls selling traditional Korean food. Most of the shop owners speak very limited English, food stalls menu has English translation on them."
61,4.0,"For those of you who are looking to buy cheap snacks and souvenirs, this is the place to be. The famous honey butter almonds only cost 5,000 Won here VS 7,500 Won in Myeongdong. I'm so glad I went here because I hoarded snacks and was able to save a lot of money. The food was good too!!!!"
62,2.0,"Other than a few overrated street food stores, the rest is just shops selling traditional Korean food, such as Kimchi and dried seafood."
63,3.0,"Interesting to see the crowd if you dare to brave it. We managed to find seats at a stall that sold seafood.  Very cheap!  Sine we were not into shopping, there was nothing else except to expert the place and eat something from there."
64,4.0,"Gwangjang Market, is a traditional street market and it one of the oldest market in Korea.Also,It popular market.Some area in this market dirty and with Awful smell .It is good place to buy korean traditional clothes Hondbok. Also,It contain food court.It tourist spot.The bad thing is Bad Smell in the market."
65,4.0,"Though this is well-known to tourists, foods here aren't that touristic.As most visitors are aware of, the highlight of this market is to eat. And tourists can easily have dishes sitting next to common old generations of local people.Having lots of menus in open spaces, foreign visitors are going to enjoy watching and won't have much difficulties to pick what to try. Prices aren't high either.In addition, there are volunteers ready to help."
66,5.0,an area full of little shops and smiling faces for buying traditional and touristy items. Plenty of eats as well.
67,5.0,"Went there to experience the local market and of course, food! There were many stalls are selling the same things and the ajummas would call out to you. Look out for the stalls with celebrity photos and visits by TV stations. Best part was the mung bean pancake, so delicious! And sikhye which is a sweet rice punch drink!Snacks such as honey butter almonds and seaweed are cheaper than in Lotte Mart."
68,5.0,This is a great market in Seoul. You can basically enjoy a wide variety of Korean street foods in one place. It's not expensive and you get to see the most popular snacks in one place. The bindeteok is a Korean mung bean pancake which they grind on the spot and fry. The visual is amazing. Must go.
69,3.0,"well, it's a subway stop and a traditional market.  most venders sell similar products/food so this place won't take you a long time to tour.  stop by, grab some korean street food and go.  across the street, there are many restaurants that specialize in chicken soup and grilled fish, so make sure you save enough stomach space for that."
70,4.0,"Went there with my family when we were in Seoul during June 2017. The nearest Subway station is ""Jongno 5(o)-ga station"" on the Dark Blue Line 1, which is 4 stops from Seoul Station or 1 stop from Dongdaemun station. Right after one take Exit 8 of Jongno 5(o)-ga station, beside is the Gwangjang Market. There is a main local food street alley that cut across this large Gwangjang marke, selling lots of interesting local food/snacks, ranging from inexpensive & popular Mung bean pancakes, Korean Kimbap (similar to Japanese Maki roll) to mid range traditional Jokbal (braised pig trotters) and to more expensive fresh seafoods like live Octopus & Abalone to go with the Korean Shoju. But what amazes me the most is the ""Ganjang Gejang"", a Korean traditional disk that uses raw... (you read me correctly...) 'raw' crabs/prawns/fish roes lightly marinated with either soyu-based sauce, or more spicy bean paste sauce. As for rest of Gangjang market, we saw lots of shops selling mainly traditional Hanbok, beddings materials and some ladies fashions. For those who have plans to visit/ or have visited Dongdaemun (1 subway stop away), could perhaps consider sparing some time (around 2 hours) and some space (in your stomach) to check out this interesting Gwangjang market."
71,3.0,"Gwangjang Market is a traditional market in Seoul.you can go by subway till Jongno 5 ga,exit 12..and cross the road.In this market,they sell various food..but i think it's similar from 1 stall to another..And you can buy snacks here..peanuts etc"
72,4.0,"Nice markets, it was huge and lots of entrance, you can find almost everything local. The foods abit on the pricier side."
73,4.0,"Interesting location for traditional Korea culture, you can buy hanbok from this place price depending on the detailed of the hanbok chosen"
74,4.0,"Great place to go as they have many street food along the market. The only problem is, they might not be able to speak English and will be hard to order (pricing is not listed well so better ask before ordering)."
75,4.0,A traditional market with almost anything you want to live seafood. At first I was wanting to visit this place as it was featured on many tv programs. Got there and was greeted with a full stench of seafood market and crowds of people gathering in the middle eating trotter or some type of offals. then in the middle of the market things got really crowded. I managed to find a good spot in the middle of the market where they have tteokboki and hotteok and the famous Gimbab. All is good but after a while at the market I was really missing the comfort of a modern place and not getting bumped by every passerby. Food was great but you will need to bear with the other aromas around you after all it is a traditional market.
76,4.0,"Go early in the morning before the crowds appear!  You will not be disappointed. It was originally a market for clothings and related materials etc, but in the centre of the market is the food stalls.  There are so many choices.  Go to whichever one you fancy, sit on the bench in front of the stall and order.  Eat with the locals - though I must say there are lots of tourists too.  A good experience."
77,4.0,"It is an everyday market where you can enjoy food, fashion and everything at reasonable price. It is open almost all day long, usually from 9am to 23pm. Famous dishes include Soonhee's Bindaetteok (mung bean pancake) and mayak gimbap (mini Korean sushi rolls)."
78,4.0,"Went to the clothes section first and the stalls were already packing up. Decided to venture further down and the food and wet market was thriving with activity. Many stalls were selling similar food, snacks and drinks so be sure to compare before buying. Try to have a meal in the market where Uig can sit on benches or small stools and see the ahjummas prepare the food in front of you. Though their English competency is poor, surprisingly most could speak Mandarin. I'd suggest you try to speak Mandarin if you can.Tip: get pre-packed samgyetang ingredients here. They include a large ginseng in them which would make great souvenirs to ppl who love to cook. Can't find them in e-mart, homeplus and other supermarkets"
79,4.0,"Has everything you'd want to buy in Seoul or all of Korea.Huge selection of food, both fresh and cooked.Really a must see place."
80,4.0,"This place was interesting because it looked like a Korean version of the Philippines' Divisoria, and it was a bit fun to go circles in it but you'd definitely get lost if you're unfamiliar of the place."
81,5.0,"This is a great place to eat lots of different food like tempura, seafood and many other dishes. And compared to other places it's pretty cheap. Even our 2 small kids (2 and 6) loved the place and the food! We had a great time and experience."
82,5.0,"This market was not too far from the subway station, less than 5 minutes I think. The market was big with 5 food alleys where we had dinner and found the dishes were delicious and cheap (of course!). Besides that, my family also tried a lot of different banchan (kimchi mostly) at various shops. This is a very great place to explore local culture and cuisine for those who visit Seoul for the first time like us!"
83,5.0,This market sells everything. Busy even on a weekday. Don't use a stroller there as some of the aisles especially near the food stalls and linen section are really narrow. Good place if you want to buy souvenirs and hanboks. Many food stalls selling everything from pancakes to live octopus.
84,5.0,"WOW interest Market, A must see and visit. Food outlets flat out and market huge. Had a great sit down meal and enjoyed the ambience . Can catch the subway and or a 20 minute walk from our hotel next Chungmuro Station"
85,4.0,"If you are daring then try the live octopus :-PReal Korean silk is KRW 25,000 ++ for 4 meters. Don't be fooled by the KRW 10,000 price tags. HWSK gives discount for Malaysians. Pathways are slightly narrow and there are some idiots that drive their motorbike through the market to deliver/transport."
86,5.0,"Great beef tartare as well as some raw seafood and sashimi. They have other stuff like Korean sushi and pancakes, etc. Overall a very traditional market and definitely a must visit if you are looking for something a bit more original and traditional. I scored two kid hanboks for 30 bucks total and that price cannot be beat!"
87,2.0,"Market was easy to locate and took my family to try some mung bean pancake. As the only person in tm family to understand and speak korean (even though I am not korean) we then went to some stalls as I took my family to try market food. Went to a stall that served spicy rice cakes, japchae, odeng and various foods. I ordered the spicy rice cakes but the women gave me odeng instead and wouldn't take back the odeng even though we hadn't touched it. Was not impressed but had to have it and ordered the spicy rice cake elsewhere."
88,4.0,"Good food, Good exprience. A lot of food to choose. It is a big market. A market in Seoul which you should NOT missed."
89,3.0,"When there for lunch. Street food - fish cake, red bean bun, green bean pancake, pork pancake etc. Lots of stalls selling dumpling soup. Walkable from the subway station. Lots of traditional shops selling pots & pans, mattress etc"
90,5.0,"We loved our foodie excursion at this market. There are different kinds of food to choose from. This is also the market that was featured in different variety shows like Running Man. This is a great place to eat local korean food, cheap and delicious! Of course be prepared to speak Korean as they don't speak english here!"
91,4.0,Easily accessible from the subway.  Good place to eat but the much hyped tekbokki and pancakes are so so only and expensive.  The mungbean pancakes are good.  Some stores are very friendly.  A must go place in Seoul.
92,4.0,Place of full visitors looking to try out the local food. Visited a stall which sold local food and Noddle soup was fantastic. There was never ending of customers who came and ate the stall especially for the vegetables pancake and bimbap. It was strange seating on a hot bench. There was another stall selling fresh seafood stew/soup (I think). The customers was given stools to seat outside the shop. It must be good as the local Koreans was not queuing for it.
93,4.0,"Main purpose for coming to this market - dinner. At this place, one can sit down in the many stalls in front of the cooks, order and eat on the spot. The only reference that I got is to go for the stalls with the largest number of people. We bought the pancake and brought it with us as we sat down for the mandu (dumplings) - the stall owner said ""OK"". After dinner, we just walked around the various stalls selling souvenirs - bought the honey butter almonds and fresh pomegranate juice."
94,4.0,Spent 2 hours there.Tried ahujma pancake and live octopus. Local fruits distribution - grapes and strawberries 👍🏻
95,3.0,"Its a huge covered market with everything from street food to souvenir to fabric and more.  If you can fit it in your schedule, its worth an hour or so strolling in it."
96,4.0,"Metro stop for Gwangjang market is Euljiro 4. Once you enter street level, head N. After one block, you'll be crossing an intersection which is a bridge across a narrow stream below. Before the next major intersection, there will be entrances to the market on the E side of the street. For the food zone entrance, head E (right) at the major intersection.The mungbean pancakes & the gimbap are vegetarian delights. The bibimbap can be. If not, have the meat 86ed. Herbivores won't be disappointed if you're into cabbage, fresh herbs, grains, sprouts, & red peppers."
97,4.0,"There were many food stands, household items, and clothing.  Almost anything can be found here.  The food stands looked really good as they cooked much of the food in front of you."
98,4.0,"weird when shopping here but worth. what i mean shopping at here is you can buy a lot snacks from here with retail price ! believe me, cheaper than other places. regret never buy a lot. Great food here and crowded !"
99,3.0,"This food stall market is a nice attraction for an hour or so.  There is plenty of food to buy, but you'll see the same food being sold in stall after stall, e.g. rice cakes, mung bean pancakes (I bought one from the stall with the longest line - and wasn't impressed at all), etc.  I also tried the dumplings and noodles in a popular stall - and wasn't impressed by the dumpling or noodles either.  There are also places for people to sit within a stall, although you will have to be buying the food from that particular stall.The market also seemed to be a little less clean than some of the other markets I've seen, so you should take that into account.  I would also suggest going to other markets like Myeongdong if you desire a greater variety of food as Gwangjang serves the same stuff in many stalls...  It did seem to be a place where locals went so even if you do not eat the food, it's an interesting place to visit."
100,3.0,"An average market. Plenty of local food available. However, personally I don't like the taste. If you have limited time in Seoul, you may skip this place."
101,4.0,"good local foods with many choices, buy small portion so you can taste as much type of food, wet and dry market with clean environment, buy snack, traditional food pack, cloth material as souvenir"
102,4.0,"This is a place for inexpensive shopping for fabrics, clothes etc with a section dedicated to a whole bunch of food outlets. The shopping is nothing extravagant but prices a were cheaper than in big shops. We went in late afternoon for a stroll in the shopping area (browsed stuff) and in the end, enjoyed a wide variety of Korean food complemented with a bottle of 'rice wine', which is a low alcohol drink (like beer). We got a combination plate that had about 8 different items. It was a great way to sample the wide spectrum of Korean street food. Though inside a busy market, the food outlets had space to sit inside.It is also good for people-watching as the locals teem for shopping and eating. Great to watch how the food is made then-and-there. However, the walking spaces are narrow and can be difficult to maneuver when crowded."
103,4.0,Went to this place for breakfast and many stalls sell korean food. We can eat there as they provide stools to sit and can take away also. You can buy many korean snacks and food also here. Price is cheaper than supermarket or others sold at Namdaemun market.
104,4.0,"I came here for the second time to buy banchan (Korean side dishes) to bring back home. The first time we came, we brought back some fermented squid side dish but in small quantity. We regretted it then since it was very delicious. This time round, we couldn't buy much too since my sister had just given birth and was not allowed to have seafood for a few months. There's even marinated raw crab which we loved when we bought it the first time round. Just tell the person that you need to take it back home on flight and they will be willing to seal-wrapped the food with no additional cost."
105,4.0,"This market is great to experience Korean food delicacies. From bintteok (mung bean pancake) to raw octopus they have it here. The market is huge with lots of allies, and they also famous for fabrics. We tried many kinds of foods here: meat pajeon, soondae, dumplings, small raw crab kimchi, and a few others i can't remember. It's also a good place to shop for korean snacks as the price can be cheaper than convenience store. Just watch out for the old ahjummas that try to increase the price if you're a foreigner :) But it's a good place to visit, especially for the food and the local experience."
106,4.0,"This is a must visit for tourist where they get to see and experience local Korean food, Pancake, and many other souvenirs.The pancake is the most popular dish and it's great to go with a bottle of magoli.The market is located nearest to Line 1 Jongno 5 Ga. The place is tourist friendly and vendors are nice and polite."
107,3.0,"Don't think you'll find much to buy unless you're in the market for traditional fabrics and clothing.Lots of street food, might not appeal to everyone. You'll find more 'traditional' street foods like Kimbap, spicy rice cakes, odeng, bibimbap (vegetarian), lots of grannies and ahjummas gathered round for their meal time-gossip session (store holders involved). The mung bean pancakes are yummy though! Crispy on the outside, and pure deliciousness inside! Doesn't taste anything like I would have imagined (I have a slight aversion towards anything with beans except beansprouts), in fact more like a thick rosti with extra ingredients inside. I'll skip the tempting-looking bowl of hand cut noodles next time though."
108,2.0,"The locals really enjoyed there.  The market was a feast for the eyes but not quite up our alley. Expect tight seatings, unfamiliar tastes and drinks are served by other stalls unless you go for the small restaurants. Suitable for snacks rather than meals."
109,4.0,"Went to this market place for dinner and walk around. There are quite a lot of variety. From vegetarian to meat / seafood. And of course, a must eat on their pancakes (kimchi/seafood). The difficult part is when you order your food, the locals do not understand English and will not know what we are referring to. Best to be more specific or try using google translate and show them what you want.  This market do sell quite a fair bit of dry products too. I bought some Butter Honey Nuts and lots of seaweeds snacks."
110,5.0,"Foodies will want to see how delicious this place is! hahaEvery corners you can find street food, mungbean pancake, chopped noodle, rice cake, korean pork blood sausage, jabchae, bibimbab, dumplings, beef tartar, bbq restaurants... so many to talk about! When you finish one alley, you will be so full yet!"
111,4.0,"The Gwangjang Market is huge (with several entrances) and is categorized by types of goods/services offered. There are several sections in the market dedicated to fashion, shoes, textiles, dry food and candy items, fresh seafood and cooked food section, fresh flowers and fruits etc. Among all, in the center of the market are the makeshift food stalls that are popular with the locals and foreign visitors. There are so much to see, do and eat here!Well, when in foreign land, one of the best ways to fully immerse and experience the local culture is to visit the traditional market, which Gwangjang Market is one of them.We arrived at the market at around 12.45pm after visiting/walking around in Dongdaemun Market and it's Stationary and Toys Street. It took us about 30 mins to walk here (though we could take the subway here, just one station).As it was lunch time, we decided to have lunch here and immediately chose a makeshift stall (actually this was recommended by someone though most stalls here are selling similar food items with some pork knuckles the Korean version, intestines of the pig etc) and tried its Gimbap, Fried Rice Cake and Fish Cake Skewer. The food was great and yummy and of course unique. The Gimbap equivalent to the Japanese's Sushi, have sesame seeds over and was very nice! The Fried Rice Cake was nice too except a bit spicy (for my friend but not for me) and sticky. As for the Fish Cake Skewer, it was fresh and nice too. In fact, the lady stallowner also served us cups of the fish soup which was very good and flavourful.The 3 items cost about 8000 won and was very much worth it, because they are delicious and quantity is such a large portion. In fact, we were very full till quite late in the evening before having our dinner. A must try!Thereafter, we walked around the market for a while buying some local souvenirs and food items. Most of the people here were very friendly and polite and not pushy for sales despite being located next to one another and selling ""me too"" products. The prices here were reasonable and lower than other places and some stallowners would also give you free gifts.A must visit place in Dongdaemum and you will be able to fully indulge and experience the Korean's culture and food cuisines. Highly recommended.* Actually I have recorded some videos of my travel trips but no way to upload here to share. Do contact me if you want to see and can catch them in my Youtube account!"
112,4.0,"Stopped by to walk around and have lunch. The market does get crowded but that is just something you come to expect while traveling Asia. The food was excellent, and while some vendors try to get you to come to their stall, most are not pushy. We will go back the next time we are in Seoul."
113,5.0,"I lived in Seoul for many year, and working in Jongno.  KUANGCHANG market is one of my favorate market with good taste and economic price.  My favorate menu are Korean sausage in 60 old restaurant - Grandma Soondae, Kimbap and Bibibap and noodle in cart market.  Could free park in weekend or easy to access from Jongno 5 ga subway station."
114,4.0,"Cheap and tasty food everywhere. Simple food not the pretty dishes you fing in restaurants. For me, this was the must visit place in Seoul. So much delicious and strange foods to taste. Fantastic."
115,4.0,"Closed to metro station and a lot of native foods and fruits to buy. However, we didn't eat over there, it is extremely hot in Aug. The fruits are cheap and fresh. Nearby I would like to recommend a very traditional ginseng soup noodle, it is highly recommend to you guy if you visit Gwangjang and don't want eat inside."
116,5.0,We took a food tour with Janet and this is a wonderful market with such interesting history and the best mung bean pancakes ever.  But with the temps near 100 degrees Fahrenheit and all the cooking going it took some of the fun out of it.  I need to go here on a cold winter day!
117,3.0,"Great to walk around, stroll around the local stores for souvenirs and kimchis! They sell kimchi per kilos.Foods are okay, nothing special and a tad overprice."
118,5.0,We went there just to buy Korean Silk. There are many food stalls and shops selling all sort of textile.
119,4.0,"So many cloth and something culture of korean people ,The Gwangjing Market so big for local .I was travelling and buy some souvenir ."
120,5.0,"Although this market has become very touristy and a little high-priced, it is still a great place to visit to see all the interesting foods that Korea has to offer.  It will also make some squirm at the same time... not for the novice traveller!"
121,5.0,We got a lot of local handmade goods were purchase as  souvenirs. The prices were pretty resonable so we didn't do too much haggling.
122,4.0,"we were there on a thursday early evening and so the place not very crowded.  besides souvenirs, there are food stalls, shoe shops, dry goods stalls, even hanbok shop.  its interesting to see such a variety of stuff in 1 market.  prices here are reasonable."
123,5.0,"The market is a great place to explore. We walked there for dinner. Many of the merchants in the market had already closed for the day, but the food stalls were buzzing with activity.  Interesting food stalls featuring Korean food... however if you do not like Korean food, this might not be the place to try for dinner.  However the varieties of kimchi, seafood and traditional Korean foods make for a very photogenic market.  We tried dotorimuk (acorn jelly) salad and bindaetteok (mung bean fried pancakes).  Delicious!"
124,5.0,"As we stay at Dongdaemum, we took a cab to Gwangjng market and it cost about 4000won which is ok as we have 4 pax, i think cheaper than subway as per person is $1250won.I would say ""tick"" off this place in your must visit place. This place is vibrant and full activities. i very much like the wet market section as we can see plenty of korean food. In the dry food section , most of the vendor are selling seaweed but different brand. Prices are competitive and some negotiation is possible. i also realised that the almond nuts are quite popular. There are also kitchenware and fabric section. I do notice that the things there are slightly cheaper than other places. Do try the pancake,noodle, porridge etc. Have Fun..."
125,5.0,"We make it a must to visit Gwangjang Market every trip to Seoul. We love the buckwheat husk pillows and Korean blankets and would cart off several every time we come to Seoul. There are so many small eateries/shops here that sell great food! My siblings aren't about to try the food from the stalls here, so we settle for the eateries/shops that sell food. How to find a good one? Look inside and see if there are many locals in there. Yup. These serve better food. Incidentally, my sibling bought a dozen sets of chopsticks, spoons and metal bowls from here. Cheapest, compared to Daiso, Insadong etc. I bought lots of souvenirs here. Cheaper than Insadong and Myeongdong. One drawback: avoid the toilets."
126,4.0,Fun market in the fact that the almonds that we bought at the market were outstanding and seemed crunchy and really fresh (even though they were imported from CA)...?  The upstairs Hanbok (traditional Korean dress) area had numerous stores (abt 100) to observe and take pics of.
127,5.0,The food is so good we came here twice. Once for dinner and once for lunch. The atmosphere is full of life as one see rows and rows of stalls selling food. Each stall owner will do their best to invite you to sample their food. I have never felt so welcomed in Seoul as here. One have to be aware that similar food is sold in each area. Hence there's lots of competition. Pancake and their traditional rice wine is a must. There's something so Korean about that as locals and foreigners dine together. We tried their local delicacy of live octopus. It took some time before we overcame our mental barrier to chew as the locals chew. Overall a very good experience.
128,3.0,"It's smaller than I have expected. The food stalls are all selling similar stuff, crammed together, so the market gets very hot."
129,5.0,Lots of beautiful and colourful hanboks. The food were cheap and delicous as well.  I really enjoyed the rice cake soup and pancakes.
130,4.0,"Look more like a market selling cooked food and street food. If you like these food, you will love this market. Vendors do not speak English. But most of the food is 1000 won or 2000 won. So  they will gesture by showing 1 finger or 2 fingers."
131,5.0,"Not a big scale market, but you will be amazed by the number of watering foods they served. Kimchi, seaweed, noodles, Korean pancake etc. Highly recommended place to visit if you're Korean food lover! They serve mainly traditional preserved Korean foods, if you're opting something like barbecue or fried chicken, this is not the place."
132,5.0,"For local goodies and food like seaweed, chocolates, almonds, ginseng, blood sausage, dumplings, fish cake, gimbap, tokkboki, etc. Gwangjang market is the place to visit. Food and goodies here are way cheaper compare to other market they range from 500-4000 won. You can also haggle with peddlers.  Expect that the place is crowded with locals.A must place to visit :)"
133,4.0,"If you have a wild streak and you are very adventurous, you can try authentic Korean cuisine.  There is dog meat and dog meat soups available as well as live octopus to enjoy if you can.  The sights and the smells are equally worth experiencing."
134,4.0,This is a very traditional market known for its variety of food. There are also different sections selling fabrics and other stuffs. But what stand out is the food section that sells all kind of Korean food. Come here for your meals and you won't be disappointed. They are cheap and good and a cultural experience too!
135,5.0,"If you want to see the real Seoul, this is the place. The stalls are amazing, the variety immense, and the senses are overwhelmed by the sheer buzz of the place. Well worth a visit."
136,4.0,"Whilst in Korea, I came to really like their traditional markets, it just reminds me so much of things when I was abit younger. And Gwangjang Market is no exception. It’s huge and you can find lots of things here that you typically wouldn’t find outside of a traditional market. So, fabrics, dried food produce etc. Fruit here is fresh and pretty affordable and there are also lots of food stalls in the center of the area. We tried Bindaetteok, which is a kind of pancake only found in that area of Seoul (that’s what I heard). However, it gets super crowded by 11am, so if you are looking to browse around at a more leisurely pace, do arrive earlier. A lot of the stalls open really early (earliest opening 830am)."
137,2.0,"We arrived around 4pm, some ladies we setting up food stalls, so maybe this can be a different experience later in the day. However, the shops are really one dimensional, bolt after bolt of cloth and pre-made clothing. Worth a miss in my book."
138,4.0,"This is a traditional market in Seoul. If you plan to go this place I recommend that you also can go to Dongdaemun, these two place are really close. You also can have breakfast in this market and get some tradition stuff, everything is very cheap. Anyway we had a great time in this market."
139,5.0,"We stayed in Dongdaemun.  The first time, we walked to the market.  It took us about 45 minutes but then we stopped at various stalls/shops along the way.  The second time, we took the metro and the market was less than a 5 minute walk from the station.We loved the mung bean pancakes and the mayak kimbap.  We could have eaten them everyday..."
140,5.0,"i love love the food here. been here twice for the lunch/dinner just cause i couldn't get enough of the mayak kimbap! this place is pretty big they have food section, clothes, accessories etc. totally worth a visit"
141,4.0,what i really love about this place is their food. you will be able to eat different types of authentic Korean food.Live Octopus? you can eat them here. I haven't tried i am not that adventurous yet. but they said it's good with beer
142,2.0,This place is just a huge old market in Seoul. Street food here isn't great and things aren't hygiene. Honestly there isn't much to look at or to do. I only go if I want to look for vintage/ old/ cheap clothes on the second floor. Anyway I don't recommend this place for tourists!
143,2.0,"we are a little dissappointed with the food stalls in this market. not that sanitary and delicious and very very crowded. however, there are lots of dried goods and clothing for sale."
144,4.0,"This market is not as I expected since the food section is only for a small section in the market (from Exit 2 of Subway).  The rest is for hanbok tailors or fabrics.The food section is quite crowded with some similar cuisine.However, for travelers, it is a good place to explore Korean culture through cuisine. The price (for sure) is for tourists. Haha."
145,4.0,If you looking for souvenir this is the right place.. very cheap compare to other place.I went there because of Running man haha.. Crowded because you may see the local food there
146,4.0,"Still a bustling local market, this is a great place to try street food (if you can find a seat among the locals and if you can figure out how to order!). Food prices are cheap and it’s a great place to soak in local culture. One tip: remember what gate/door you entered by (esp if you’re meeting a group or guide later). It’s easy to lose your orientation. Also, try the bindaetteok (mung bean pancake), it was our fav and we wish we had got more instead of sharing one."
147,5.0,"Lots of local street food and dried food. There are store that sell live octopus. If you order, they will take the octopus from aquarium, cut it alive and serve it to you. You are going to experience the octopus tentacle moving around inside your mouth when you take your first bite. ;p"
148,4.0,"This is the 2nd time we returned to Gwangjang area to salivate our family favourite Raw Beef with raw egg yolk on top. And we attempted raw octopus as well this round, which is yummilicious!!!Many friends said how do you eat such yucky raw meat? Actually, it is really tasty & crunchy. Coupled with their 6% alcohol Makgeolli, which is sweet to the taste bud. Heaven!Both time, we were the only foreigners amongst the local Korean.There are many stalls there. But we choose the one facing the T junction in the market, with an elderly mending the cashier counter (probably the owner).Tips to get there :- Train to  Jongno-5ga, Line 1 , exit 10- On the left side of exit, walk into the lane between two pharmacies; Gukje Yakguk (국제약국) and Ujeong Yakguk (우정약국).- Turn right and you will hit a T junction. There are a few similar restaurant there."
149,5.0,"As all Korean markets, the centre of this market is also covered in food stalls. Beckoning store owners fighting for your business show case all sorts of traditional Korean pancakes, ricecakes, fish sticks, fried foods and...this is also the place to try Korea's famous raw beef - Ukhye/Yukhoe/Yukke (however it is romanised).Secretly tucked away are a couple of small stores that sell souvenirs here as well and this is where I always come to buy my souvenirs as they're slightly cheaper than Insadong. Don't expect to find everything you want here though due to its smallness."
150,5.0,"Try everything, from the sashimi foodstalls to the off the aisle korean hot pot diners frequented by locals."
151,4.0,"We visited Gwagjang Market (also named 'Kwangjang Market' on some maps/street signs) during midday until lunchtime. There are heaps of food stalls, selling all different types of foods - fruits and vegetables, savory pancakes, seafood (the all-famous live octopus), kimchi dumplings, noodles, miniature gimbap (Korean sushi rolls), meat dishes like pig hands and ""sausages"" etc.The next streets are dedicated to different things such as Korea's traditional dresses - hanbok, duvets etc. What's also convenient is that Dongdaemun Market is also nearby, which we took by subway."
152,4.0,"For those who look for a different experience other than shopping for cosmetics and fashion items in Seoul, drop by at Grmwangjang Market! Have a taste of a famous mung bean pancake and many other delicacies in very reasonabke prices."
153,3.0,Visited in the evening.  This is more of a local night market and mostly food stalls available in the night.  The fresh produce stalls were mostly closed for business.
154,5.0,This is one of the great places to explore and experience the locals' way of life. There is a whole section selling cooked food that is cheap and delicious. Try the famous mung bean pancakes!
155,4.0,Love this market.  To know the culture of the country.   Many local stuff sold at this market.   A lot of local food stores that you can just seat down and eat.  The price is reasonable.
156,5.0,"I went there to have breakfast and shopping.Local street food available in Gwangjang Market. All of the food here consolidated.Aside to that, you can buy literally everything here. From traditional Korean wear, Hanbok. To Kimchi, Ginseng, Seaweed, and even Korea food cutlery.Kind of regret going first thing in the morning because we end up with alot of shopping items to carry around.All of their things there are reasonably priced. Love that."
157,4.0,"By far, my favorite street treat is the Korean Pancake! For a 1000 wons, no better treat...The energy is fast and busy. Like a swap meet almost."
158,5.0,"This market is selling authentic local food by the locals. You sit right in front of the stalls to consume your purchases. Great experience.There are also stores that sell clothes, kitchen needs, raw food, snacks etc."
159,4.0,"Anneyonghaseyo..hi. 1st time here. Walking through the shops on the streets. Lots of clothing shops and food stalls. My wife bought some silk scarf (10 pieces) as souvenirs for her friends the price are 5000 krw per pieces and got 2 pieces free from the seller. Thanks! Talking about the pasar Maran. Maybe only readers from Pahang Malaysia can understand of what I'm referring to. Kind of unbelievable on some area I can see the pasar maran here. Old folks are sitting on the ground, selling their agro stuffs like vegetables, herbs and beans etc. Reminding me at home."
160,4.0,"We went there mainly for dinner and enjoyed it tremendously.We had mung bean pancake, pork pancake, fish cake, sundae (AWESOME! -aka blood sausage but subject to individual taste)rice cake (ok, the market's one was a bit too chunky for our liking.Gimbap (found it so so -, not too sure what the hype is about on people's blogs though)It was nice seating at the stalls and experiencing the market ambiance."
161,5.0,"I gave this an excellent review because of the convenient location and I enjoyed the food but its not for people who dislike smelly local markets and unhygienic conditions. I love the vibe of the place as the place is abuzz with activity and colorful. You are spoilt for choice of dumplings, korean pancakes and seaweed rolls, but always ask the price and contents of these foods before buying because the fillings vary slightly from stall to stall. Look out for those that have proudly put up photos of their food/stalls being covered in local variety/TV shows as they are likely to be better than others, if you cannot decide which ones to buy from. The seasoned seaweed/laver/kelp snacks that come in packs of up to 16 individual packets are reasonably good here: you can bargain for lower price if you buy in bulk (e.g. between 5,000 to 8,000 won instead of 6,000 to 10,000 won)."
162,3.0,"This is the market that is always pictured for the traditional food- and there are lots of them. It doesn't really matter where you sit since they all taste the same to me. If you need to get your hanboks and textiles , this is the place for you. The clothes offered are more for the bigger and older clients I think."
163,5.0,"This market has more of a local feel than some of the other bigger names. There is a phenomenal array of street food available.  Even if you aren't ready to take the plunge and try some of the offerings it's worth a visit to take in the spectacle with your other senses.  There are also quite a few shops with embroidery, traditional clothing, foods, and textiles.  It is easy walking distance from Daedongmun (another fun area) and is accessible by public transit or the city for bus.  The market doesn't really get going until lunch time on Sunday,  I'm not sure how early it begins on week days.  Definitely worth a visit."

165,5.0,"So many stuff here , decent price, go there after city hall.  Some wholesale hair stuff here, such as traditional Korean dress, korean interesting food."
166,4.0,"This is definitely a paradise for Korean food lover! This market is huge and you can find everything here. The hawkers are friendly and able to converse in simple English. Lastly, strongly recommend to try bindaetteok! Don't miss it when you visit Seoul."
167,4.0,"Must be the longest linear set of markets imaginable, at least 300-400m long. Atmosphere is great and lots of interesting clothing options. Not really clothes strictly for tourists but rather more local markets. That makes them cool. Our teenage kids loved this area."
168,3.0,"This place has the biggest selection of seafood pancakes I've ever seen. I'd never had one before this, but they were soooo good!! There was also a ton of other local food there being sold by street vendors, and a lot of it looked amazing (except maybe the pig snouts).I didn't find much else here. It seems to be a local textile market, so if you know anyone that likes to sew or collects buttons, then this is a great place to go!"
169,4.0,"Saw this place on Runningman. The food selection there was amazing! Pancakes were delicious and so were the noodles. I was too stuffed to eat anything else. However, the beautiful colours of all the food being sold will make you salivate. A visual feast! A treat for the avid food photographer!Do not go on a Sunday if you wish to see more than just food as most of the other shops are closed (only food stalls remain open). If you are only going for the food, well then, sundays are okay. :)"
170,3.0,Try the Jeon (Mung Bean Pancakes) and its interesting to look around the preserved seafood and vegetables stalls. A stop more to try out local snacks in a local market rather than shopping...
171,4.0,"Went here mainly because of the food court! It was one of the best places in Seoul to experience authentic Korean food. I really enjoyed our lunch here! Was able to find and try out some KBS approved food stalls. Oh and if you love pickled vegetables, this is the place to be! Pickled radish, pickled cucumber, kimchi, you name it, this market's got it!"
172,5.0,Very impressive food section of the market along with an entire 2nd level dedicated to the tailoring of traditional Korean costumes / Hanbok.
173,4.0,"The foods are really good but can get quite a bit pricey. We didn't sit there and eat , had our foods take out. And most of them can speak Chinese which is really convenient. Actually there isn't a big variety of foods , you can see them selling the same thing stalls after stalls~"
174,3.0,"It was massive, and probably not a destination if you have something specific in mind. Maybe good for a long-term traveller to explore, but not so good for a family on vacation."
175,4.0,"Easily accessible through Jongno 5-ga or Euljiro 4-ga station, Gwangjang Market is a fantastic place to grab a small bite to eat or a proper meal. The place tends to be crowded much of the time but that is also what gives it its character. Eating at one of the outdoor stalls, sitting next to the locals gives you a true experience of what its like to be a Korean and the food is truly authentic in flavour. It might be tough to get a seat at one of these stalls its definately worth the effort to do so. Overall, I feel that it is one of the best markets and it is definitely on my to-go list if I were to visit Seoul again."
176,5.0,"From fruits, vegetables, apparel, household items, hanboks, wedding items and yummy food... it's a market you can't miss when you're in Seoul.Try bindaetteok (mung bean pancake), eomuk (fish cake), pumpkin porridge, mayak kimbap, boribap and so much more."
177,4.0,"I bought clothing, purses, and had lunch all in one location. Everything was inexpensive and plentiful. It is crowded but most of korea is crowded.  I shopped for hours and then had a cup of tea and a green tea cake. Great day!"

This multi-level market has about 5,000 shops and it’s a market that you can find everything, from snacks, traditional Korean food, bags, shoes, Kimchi, exotic seafood to the high-end silk, linen and the legendary Hanbok.Right at the heart of this market lies the food section that is bursting with activity and loud noise. The steam-filled alley contains countless number of food stalls that offers a vast selections of Korean food like Japchae (당면 sesame oil noodle), Gimbap (김밥 rice roll), Sundae (순대 blood sausage roll), Jokbal (족발 braised pig trotter), Patjuk (팥죽 red bean porridge), and the very well known item in Gwangjang market – Bindaetteok (빈대떡 Mung bean pancake).Among the food stalls, the one that stood out was those that are selling Bindaetteok, with stacks of towering golden-brown crispy pancakes that are freshly fried and served piping hot.I ordered the veggie version and the meat version, and both are reasonably priced at W$3,000 each."
179,4.0,Must visit for Authentic Korean food and fabrics!Bought all my marinated stuff here- though we did not  speak Korean! Friendly Ajuma gave us hot coffe as it was really cold! Mouth watering local dishes here to try!
180,4.0,"If you are the type who likes adventure in your food and does not mind eating in a market this is a must place to try the local specialties like gimbap (rice roll), sundaes (blood sausage) pajeons (vegetable and seafood pancakes), noodles and many more.  Yummy and cheap!  The merchants are all very friendly and generous in their servings.  Unlimited refills on some stalls I had mine for my noodles."
181,5.0,"You will spend so much time eating and eating and eating all the different types of food here. So many vendors are selling sundae (soon-dae). It less crowded on week days, but on the weekend and holidays expect a lot of locals dining out."
182,4.0,"Have been to many popular markets like Namdaemun and Noryangin and hence decided to try out Gwangjang market this time round.Took a cab from Gwanghwamum to Gwangjang market and it cost less than 5,000won. It is more worth it to cab considering the fact that subway costs you around 1,100won per person without T Money. However we took the subway back just to test out the public transport accessibility. Rather convenient as well but we would rather skip the walking in the hot sun.There are apparently 5,000 stalls mainly selling hanbok (korean tranditional clothes), bed linens, clothes for ajuma (middle aged women) and street food. The market is divided into east and west with 2 storeys. Don't worry about getting lost here as it is quite neat and hence you will have no problem finding your way area.I love the atmosphere here! Here you can witness how the real Koreans live - having a makgolli with fried soybean cakes (bindindaek? pardon my spelling). You can see them frying these savory pancakes everywhere! Visit one that makes it on the spot! it cost us 4,000 won for a serving so huge to be shared by 2 for lunch. It was simply delicious paired with the onion sauce and kimchi. There are other items like sundubu (blood sausage stuffed with glass noodles), tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes), namgmyeun (cold noodles in beef broth), gimbap (Korean rice wrapped in seaweed with sesame seeds and radish) and other local food. We came here around 3pm and it was rather empty but it didn't stop us from being called out by the female hawkers to try their food. Loved their enthusiasm in their work!Mum bought some ladies wear and they are at least 50% cheaper than those sold in Cityhall and Myeongdong - exactly the same design and material.If you like to find good local souvenirs and hanbok for children, Gwangjang market's prices are at least 30% cheaper than Dongdaemum and Insadong.Is a great experience without being touristy unlike Insadong."
183,4.0,"While some of the ground-floor hambok and clothing is quite low quality and aimed at tourists (although the bolts of linen and cotton, and monk's clothes and suits on the ground floor are a bit better), the upstairs has much higher-quality hambok, silks, and many dozens - maybe hundreds - of vendors of much more interesting and contemporary mens and womens clothing.The food on the ground floor is very good, with fried mung bean pancakes (bindaetuk - you can even tell taxi drivers that you want the bindaetuk market and they'll know what you mean), great fresh pork dumplings (mandu) and lots and lots of decent-to-very-good rice/veggie/meat rolls (kimbap - literally, seaweed rice ... the vegetarian version with wasabi, miyak kimbap, is also popular here). Not sure I'd trust the fresh fish vendors here but the meat looks decently regrigerated, at least ... nothing really beats Noryangjin for fish.This is a fun way to spend an afternoon, and far easier than Dongdaemun by far. The food is much more limited than Namdangmun, but not bad at all. Clothing prices are terrific, and it's a good place to get kids shoes and clothing and, upstairs, clothing for adults. Also, if you're looking for a really nice hambok, for a wedding or special event, you can't beat the silks and other vendors here."
184,4.0,"Feel the nearest vibes to how a traditional market is and coming here allows us to have a better understanding of their normal daily lives...The area is huge which ranges from stores offering their local snacks, seafoods to shops selling hanbok,blankets, pots and lots of stores selling cloths... etc...if u're not in a rush for time, just choose a store and have your lunch here :-)it's affordable and a different kind of experience too We like it here and recommend to anyone who's in Seoul!"
185,5.0,"We went here solely because our teenage daughter loves sewing. Once she read that this is supposed to have the best selection of dress fabrics there was no stopping her. To get there, we walked from Insadong down to the Cheong-gye-cheon river and then along that for 15 minutes. Getting back up from the stream, the area looked a bit more run down but once inside the market you don't really notice it.This place is packed with dress fabric of all sort ranging from heavy woollen suit material to light jerseys and polyester / silk with anything inbetween as well.You will need to have a fair idea of what you want to buy since the choice might well overwhelm you otherwise. We ended up with two lots of stretchy fabrics with lovely pints on them. Both came out at around 5,000 won per metre and with a bit of hand signing if was possible to communicate to the traders how much we wanted. There was also not too much heavy selling going on, i.e. you could look at stuff without immediately being pressured by the stall holder.If you like your sewing and want a souvenir of your trip I would recommend this place.We got here at 10.30 and it felt reasonably empty. The downside of course was that none of us was hungry enough to try any of the food. Maybe another time!"
186,5.0,"Super tasty and various food there. No matter you are looking for snacks. lunch or breakfast .It's really a great place to go. I enjoyed the meal very much .Also , You can buy some traditional daily dish like ""soy sauce crab"" etc.Of course there are traditional Korea clothing and convenience goods stores located in the market , To experience the local lifestyle that's a good place to visitThe vendors there only have few seats so..there's a sub-rule like you cannot just ordered 1 dish to share..you'll be expected to order at least 2 dishes if you are more than 3 .some photos to share in my blog: http://mermaid-avenue.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/kwangjang-market.html"
187,4.0,"I really enjoyed our tour of the market. It's so huge. They have all sorts of items to buy from clothes, shoes, dried foods, etc. What I enjoyed most is the yummy food that can be eaten there! Even if it's winter, the seats are warm with heating system so we can still eat leisurely. But it is best if you go there with someone who can speak Korean because the sellers only communicate in their language."
188,5.0,"Gwangjang Market located in central Seoul, next to Chungae stream.It's really crowded and busy place except on Sunday. You can buy Korean traditional dresses, shoes, clothes etc..and enjoy yummy food! To buy Hanbok, traditional Korean dress, Go upstairs where wholesalers located!you can buy Tailored Korean silk dress set by 1/2 price to Gangnam area. (it took for 3-5 days for express, normally 7-10 days)"
189,5.0,"The Gwangjang market is a mini-food paradise. Try the bin dae ddok (Korean style pancake made from ground mung beans ** highly recommended **), pigs trotters (my mum was a little disappointed that the trotters felt a little cold), seafood sashimi, and many more yummy local food. If you are in Seoul, make sure you do not give this a miss."
