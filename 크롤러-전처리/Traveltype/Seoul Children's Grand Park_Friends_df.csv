0,4.0,Visited Seoul Children's Grand Park during Summer and it was a great trip. Went there at about 4pm and there was the music fountain show. Walked around the area a bit before heading towards the zoo and it was already closed. Be sure to reach earlier if you intend to visit the zoo and the various museums there since they close pretty early.
1,5.0,"Definitely a good place for kids to have fun, there is a theme park and a zoo in this place so it should fill up the whole day"
2,5.0,"This is one of Seoul's best values for the family or anyone really. It's an old huge park that has many things to do for all types of people whether young or old. One of the highlights is the amusement  park which is not huge but good for children up to high school kids. The rides aren't huge but big enough for kids to enjoy and you can purchase single ride tickets too. There's a smallish zoo that kids would love. Also, there are a couple of playgrounds for kids to romp around in. If the weather is good, I would recommend taking a day or half a day and walking around."
3,1.0,"While this park is okay (nothing too special) the zoo area is totally depressing. It can be really hard to see the animals penned in such small enclosures. In Seoul, there are dozens of other parks and even a better zoo. I would really advise travelers to not go to this place. If you want amusement rides, you can find several other amusement parks in and around Seoul to visit that don't have such a sad portion to their park."

5,4.0,This park is designed as a kids atraction and has an amusement park section as well as ZOO and botanic sections. There is a small recyckled art pathway and a fountain which is synchronised with music. If you have some spare time it's a nice place but don't make it your Top 10
6,5.0,Went there with a friend and had so much fun! It reminded me of my childhood and made me feel like a child again. This park is so big that even though i spend there whole day i still could see much more on my next visit.
7,5.0,"I find this park not only a fun place for children, but also for adults. :)I went here last April 3 and experienced the wonderful spring colors, especially the world's famous cherry blossoms that lined the sides of the park's pathways. There's a place for children's rides, a science museum, a mini zoo, and a flower museum (mini enclosed garden)."
8,5.0,"There is a small zoo including sea animals, a greenhouse, landscaped walking paths all for free. And if you get hungry, you can stop by the cafe for hamburgers, curry rice, pasta, and coffee at the entrance of the zoo.  We were a group of adult friends looking for a quiet relaxing way to have lunch and spend the afternoon.  I was not disappointed because it was a pretty place for photographs.  We went on 7 December 2015 and it was cold. I'm sure Spring or Summer or Fall season would be a perfect time to visit this place. The train station stop is the same name on the Green Line."
9,4.0,One of my favourite hangout in Seoul because it's free and I am a kid at heart. There is a mini zoo that features many more animals that you would expect from a park. I usually visit with my friends when we just want to hangout but don't want to sit around and do nothing. Not advised to visit on weekends cause it will be super crowded. Weekdays afternoons are the best.
10,3.0,"It's a park with zoo, botanical garden, amusement park, etc. I went to take a walk there and looked around. There are a lot of families with young children there. You can also see teens taking thrill rides at the amusement park. The admission is free but you have to pay to enjoy the rides. Overall, it was really nothing much."
11,5.0,"It's free to enter this outstanding park with many option to enjoy it. It looks small at the entrance, but definitely huge inside."
12,4.0,"If you find Lotte World & Everland is too busy & crowded, suggest you to visit this place with your childredn, especially to see cherry blossom in April.  Frankly speaking, I didn't expect there were so many cherry trees before visiting.  The cherry blossom was very awesome and eye-catching.  The most important was that this park was big enough to let the visitors to have enough space to walk around & appreciate this beautiful blossom.  Have fun in this park."
13,5.0,"Date of Visit: 2013-09-21My two young boys loved the park, from the Animals, Sculptures, Exhibits and the food. Unfortunately for us, the area where the carousel and rides were (as seen in the Gangnam Style music clip) were in a section that had been closed off and it was being redeveloped.However, that aside, it is well worth attending."
14,5.0,"We stumbled across this place and was quite surprised! Its a great free, theme park/Zoo for both young and old. The monkeys were great, I did wonder about some of the enclosures being very small and other people have questioned it so I hope they do look after them well. Some parts of it were a bit runned down but its definately a great place to visit or walk through! They do put the animals away later in the day as we found out so keep in mind the closing times. A Must visit if you are in the area. If you are in guesthouses nearby its a great day out without travelling too far!"
