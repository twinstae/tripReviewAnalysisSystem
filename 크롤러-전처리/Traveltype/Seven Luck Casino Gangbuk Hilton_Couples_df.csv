0,1.0,"This is an Asian style casino.... Meaning no glamour, dirty, crammed full of rowdy male gamblers (mostly tourists groups flown in from China) who are pushy, loud and love to spit into cups. Filthy place !!!!!!"
1,3.0,"This casino was quite busy and I don't think they were all folks staying in the hotel. Although they say no locals, there seemed to be a lot of people there so they must have all been visiting, mostly from China. The casino is quite small with about 2-3 dozen tables and the same number of slots. The minimum bid is actually quite high compared to what you can get in Macau or Vegas. For a fun place to lose a bit of money and have some fun, it was a nice getaway but it is quite small and not that much variety."
2,2.0,"This place looks great on the outside and as you walk in the entrance to have your passport checked.  Then, you enter the actual casino room.  It's so dirty and old feeling.  There really is no excitement in there or fun energy.  It's just a bunch of old people sitting around smoking.  There aren't free (alcoholic) drinks, although there is a long line to get your free coffee/tea.  Since Korean citizens aren't supposed to be legally allowed to play at this casino, I didn't expect there to be only Koreans there, but it seemed like we were the only foreigners who didn't speak Korean in the whole place.  The tables are run in Korean language, ironically, since Korean citizens are not supposed to be allowed.  I understand that we're in Korea and some people with Korean background but of different nationality will be there, but for a place that is supposed to cater to foreigners I expected that the dealers would at least be able to speak a language other than Korean.  Not the case.  None of them seemed happy to be there, and I felt like they just wanted us to leave.  Really not a welcoming atmosphere.  We left in horrible moods and completely disappointed.  This is only getting 2 instead of 1 because of the pretty entrance and exterior."
3,4.0,"Well, I like this casino because the lighting is quite bright for casino setting. Being no local is better in a way, I always at least find a place to bet.Smoking is fine since I am a social smoker myself. My wife did complain.Roulette was set that you can bet in both sides on one roulette. The speed is slow moving. I can say that it is at least three time slower per spin.I like this too. At least I can think of my lucky number.Nobody force you to tip.By the sound of my tune, of course I won."
4,2.0,"Firstly, bring your foreign passport and get a free casino members cardSecondly, the above card entitles you to 2 free meals at the casino restaurant.  Excellent quality lunch type food (rice bowls/noodle soups with seafood/beef).  This free food was better then what I ate in normal restaurantsThirdly, quench your thirst with unlimited coffee, tea, juice)Fourthly, wear a gas mask: the casino is filled with Chinese tourists who smoke non-stop"
