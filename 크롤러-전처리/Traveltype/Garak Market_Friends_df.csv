0,4.0,"We went there for lunch on a Saturday. Many local people than tourists were there. We first bought our fresh seafood from the wet market on the ground floor, then we went to the second floor to get a restaurant to cook the seafood for us. Prices were affordable and reasonable. We like this wet market as it is very clean and less touristic compared to Noryangjin fish market. The only issue was its location. It is a bit far away from Myeongdong."
