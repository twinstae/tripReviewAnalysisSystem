2,5.0,"Ever since I've watched a drama about King Sejong, I knew I had to visit his statue and take a photo with him. Little did I know that it's in the center of Seoul. It is very easy to find and impossible to miss when visiting the Gyeongbokgung Palace, Cheonggyecheon Stream, and other famous spots in Seoul.King Sejong's statue is among the popular tourist spots in the area so don't miss taking a souvenir photo with him. You might just have to fall in line. And maybe ask for someone to take your photo if traveling alone like me."

5,4.0,"This is an important landmark in Seoul anddepicts the 15th century Korean monarch, Sejong the Great, the fourth king of Joseon dynasty. It is strategically located in Gwanghwamun Square with the backdrop of Gyeongbokgung Palace. The king is presented smiling and sitting on his golden throne with one hand raised and the other resting on a book.His main claim to fame is the invention of Hangul, the official alphabet of the Korean language.  This consists of 14 consonants and 10 vowels. I haven't studied this much more but I was amused to be accosted in a nearby street by two young teenage girls who wanted to interview me as a foreigner, give me a pamphlet on Hangul and show me how to write my first name in Hangul."

8,4.0,"C ( 17.12.06  ) King Sejong is great king in Korea history. The King sejong made Korean alphabet, Hangeul, the most scientific letter. The statue was landmark in this area with the statue of Yi Sun-sin. There was good museum under this statue, and must go."
9,4.0,"The King Sejong Statue is located at the centre of Gwanghawmun Square. This is a grand square that is located in front of the Gwanghwamun Gate. The king is best remembered for the Korean alphabet which he invented. He was a wise king who led Korea in the fields of science and technology. He invented the rain gauge, the sundial and a celestial globe. He also made great progress in agriculture and literature. That is why the statue of the king has a book in his hand.The statue is made of bronze and is about ten metres high. Behind the statue, there are six columns with golden carvings. These tell the story of what the king achieved and accomplished. On the side of the square is a stream that flows on tiles that have Korean inscriptions. This is the “Waterway of History”."

12,3.0,"There isn't much to this statue in the middle of the street near one of the best palaces in the country and the Blue House. If you're around Seoul long enough, you'll see it, but you shouldn't go out of your way."

17,3.0,"My relatives used to live around this area so I would often pass by while traveling. It's a great place to visit for pictures since it's close to the Gyeongbok Palace and easy access to the subway. It's a huge area so you can totally take some cool pictures! Also, underground there's a bookstore so you can spend some time there to look around and buy cute stationaries. Let me warn you that this area often has strikes and protests so it can get crowded and loud to visit on the wrong day."
18,4.0,"If you're learning Korean, this statue is a must-go pilgrimage. The statue of Saejong the Great King is a tribute to the king who educated the Korean populace by inventing the Korean alphabet, called Hangeul."
19,3.0,"When you come out of the Gyongbokgung palace, you see a large plaza in front of it. There are buildings along both sides of the plaza.Half way along the plaza is the statue.

32,4.0,"The statue of Sejong the Great is probably one of the most prominent landmarks in Gwanghwamun Square.  No doubt it's a great spot to take customary Instagram or travel photos if you're a foreign tourist (like me), but I would highly recommend that you visit the museum below the statue which is located a couple of floors underground.  You'll find more information about the King, and the many new tools such as the sundial that were used during his reign."
33,5.0,"Not enough time nor space - and most likely being a foreigner - no point, to attempt to describe what impact the King had on Korea and Koreans.  But there are important moments to relish while in Seoul.  And this story and place can give you a time to really think on how he innovated and changed a nation and people.  No selfies needed here.  What is needed is a time to connect with the Korean people."
34,3.0,"This statue is located in the middle of Seoul. It used to be very beautiful place, but recent strike movements around Jongno messed up everything. You'd better use public transportation rather than drive your car."

Sitting with a gentle smile on his face and a book in his hand, the bronze statue of 9.5m in height celebrates the King and his great achievements.The Statue is very impressive and you cannot miss if you did a bus tour for example. Otherwise easy access by 3 different metro lines.Mandatory to take a picture."

38,5.0,"I imagine travellers who visit New York wouldn't want to miss the chance to see the Statue of Liberty. The same goes with this one. You can't miss it anyway as it's there in the middle of Seoul. I walked from Changdeokgung, passed by Insadong, moved towards Gyeongbokgung. Gwanghamun Square and took a quick stop near the statue for photos. The surrounding area is busy and lively."
39,3.0,"Don't make an effort to see it, but you probably will because it's close to so many attractions of downtown Seoul, but just a very big statue."
