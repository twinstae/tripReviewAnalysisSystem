0,4.0,"Actually, there are two different hills which are quite different, the western side ""Inwangsan"" is not so strictly contolled, althought there are some polices visible, I think you can access that any day you wish, since there are no gates etc. The western side Bugaksan is military area with strict control and cameras every 100 meter. The Inwangsan side is more relaxing and more close to hiking rather than walking path in the Bugaksan. For the Bugaksan a passport needs to be with you to acces the area."
