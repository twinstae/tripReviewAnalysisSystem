1,4.0,"The KTX is just fast, reaching 300kmph speed. Our trip from Seoul to Busan (and the return journey) left in time, calling at the stops as scheduled. Thats about it. Having travelled on the equally fast Eurostar, TGV, ICE and the Renfe trains, I rank KTX below them from the experience viewpoint. Seats are comfy enough but personally the interior could be better. I did not find any buffet car to enjoy the coffee and cakes and the scenery is not that great (of course I do not compare with the likes of the Glacier Express). If you are a train buff, “Man in seat 61” website would give you an insight for comparison."
2,4.0,"Been on our own traveling to and fro Seoul and Busan. The train is well kept and have storage areas for large luggages. Clean toilets and comfortable seats. It takes us nearly  3 hours to go to Busan. There is am space for hand bags and also hanging our coats. The frequency of train is good . From11 am to 16:30, it is nearly every hour or event every 20 min per train. Train leaves punctually, so be at right platform 15 min before. Food bought outside can be consumed at the train."
3,5.0,"Booked over the counter and asked for seats near luggage. Were given excellent seats, ample space for luggage and very spacious. If you have large suitcases, take 1st class and ask for seats near luggage."
4,4.0,"If you're travelling with family with kids and luggages, this is the best option for you. It's fast, cheaper than taxi and easy. If you took Korean Air airline then you will get additional discount. Kids below 3 ride for free but they won't get a seat. KTX brings you from airport to Seoul Station which is 5 mins taxi away from Myeongdong."
5,5.0,"We chose to travel by high speed rail from Busan to Seoul and it turned out to be a great idea. Our hotel in Busan was just next door to the station so it was very convenient. The train station is tidy and offer breakfast choices. The train is also comfortable, clean, fast and on time."
6,4.0,It's really convenient to travel from Seoul to Busan by KTX. It's a rapid train. There are storage for luggages. The toilet was clean.
7,5.0,Not like European trains. KTX is on-time. Never saw a single delay on the board. Travelled 1st to Busan from Seoul. Got a biscuit and a bag labelled ”Welcome nuts”.
8,5.0,The train is as good as Singapore.. The on;y unique thing about KTX are the platform.. you will see vendo machine and even vendors selling stuff and food which I find it cool :) unlike other strict country trains... Plus the train as this eucalyptus smell on all the trains.. or maybe because it s winter and the heater has this scent.
9,5.0,We took this train from Seoul to Gyeongju and it was excellent. It cost $80 round trip and made the trek in 2 hours each way vs 5 hours by car.  It is Korea’s bullet train and can reach very high speeds. It is THE smoothest train I have ever been on. We recommend it highly.
10,5.0,Took train from Seoul to Busan. The 2.5 hour trip was very comfortable. Trains are very clean and fast. Seats recline and plenty of legroom. Electrical outlet is provided so charging your phone or laptop is a breeze. Complimentary wifi is provided and it worked well throughout the trip. Toilets are clean too. Highly recommended.
11,3.0,"Ensure tickets are purchased for front facing or it would be uncomfortable. Lift to platform is tiny and allow time if you do not want to use the stairs especially when you have luggage. The steps up the train with luggage can be challenging too. Doesn't help when most staff speak only Korean. Luggage compartment for bigger luggage is very small and you may end up having luggage in another cabin if you come late. Train speed is not uniform and for shorter distance between stations, speed is slowed down. We spent 2.5 hours Seoul to Busan but 3 over hours from Busan to Seoul so please note when you purchase tickets, some timings would have more stops. Toilets available in train but hygiene is not there. Only some seats have sockets to charge your gadgets."
12,5.0,"We purchased the Korail Pass and found the website easy to use.  After purchase, it was simple to book our tickets for each leg of our trip.  Car and seat number were clearly printed on our tickets.  The website said to print both the pass and tickets but no one ever asked us to see them.  The trains were well maintained, comfortable, on time and fast.  Luggage racks were located at the end of the cars and were able to accommodate our large suitcases.  Luckily we we’re able find space on each leg so we did not need to lug them to our seats.  Our seats had foot rests, overhead storage and reclined.  The trains were comparable to the Shinkansen in Japan.The ride was smooth with limited stops which allowed us to sleep most of the way.  Announcements, as well as LED displays, gave heads up on stations in multiple languages so we had good awareness on our location.The Busan, Seoul and Shinyeongju stations were big and busy but not too difficult to navigate.  Each had waiting areas but you could walk to the designated track, even if the trains were not boarding, as there were no ticket takers or gates.  With the exception of Shinyeongju, the stations were conveniently located in the heart of the cities we visited.In summary, the KTX was a great way to travel around Korea without the need to hop on a plane."
13,5.0,"Although more expensive than taking the bus or the regular train, we're happy that we opted to take the KTX to and from Gwangyeong - it was faster and more comfortable."
14,5.0,"If you think HK and SG were great, try Korea! By far the most complex railway system I have seen thus far, if you need to go around Korea, going by train is the best way to do it! Very efficient, fast and they can bring you all over the place! You have to purchase a T-Money card in order to ride. The good thing about the T-Money card, it can be also used on buses, taxis and even some establishments. You can pickup your T-Money card at any convenience store around Korea."
15,5.0,"The ITX train we rode on going to Gapyeong was amazing. It had +20 carts and had upper and lower levels. The seats had ample legroom and could be turned to face the opposite direction, which is good for groups of four if you want to spend most of the ride chatting. There were clean bathrooms and the doors were automatic. I'm glad I was able to experience the ITX rather than taking the bus on my way to Nami Island, Petite France, and Garden of Morning Calm."
16,5.0,"We really enjoyed our trip on the KTX from Seoul to Busan and back. It was fast, efficient, clean, comfortable, and a good way to see some of the Korean landscape outside of the main cities. Onboard wifi and USB charging ports are a bonus.However, the ticketing and seat booking process is somewhat confusing - despite pre-purchasing our passes, we had to sort out our tickets once we were in Seoul as we were travelling with kids and both the website and phone customer service was unclear. Also, seats at popular times at popular times book out quickly, so do this earlier if you can."
17,5.0,"What an amazing experience to drove at 300km/h through the midlands of Korea. Changwon to Seoul. Stations are clean and tidy, so are the trains"
18,5.0,Very fast and efficient.We used the first class carriage which was roomy and comfortable.each seat had USB & socket charging points.
19,4.0,Took the train service from Daejeon and Seoul and it was an extremely smooth ride. Seats were comfortable and there was wifi on board. Trains generally ran on time and You could get tickets online or at the train station itself. Just a point to note that it’s best to buy your return ticket ahead of time because certain routes are very popular and it might be inconvenient if you do not manage to get a ticket which entitles you to a seat because it means standing in the small space between train carriages
20,5.0,"Inchon Airport has signs, and the ticket counter has English Speaking clerks. Trains can be local (stops before Seoul) or Express (non-stop). Very clean, modern, inexpensive."
21,5.0,"Caught the KTX from Busan to Seoul and back again. Annoucements at the KTX stations are in Englih so it's easy to find the right platform when the time comes.The trains departed on the dot (so don't be late), the seats were comfy and clean.Travel time is apporx. 2.5 hours in each direction.There's a movie called ""Train to Busan"" which was a hit - catch it if you can, you don't have to know Korean to enjoy it."
22,5.0,"Best way to go from Seoul to Busan. Train is clean and efficient. Timing is really on the dot, don’t be late :)"
23,3.0,"wanted to try this fast train just to compare with shinkansen and tgv. the interior is just like a regular train, but it helped us to arrive in Busan only <3 hours."
24,4.0,"Leaves every 30-40 mins, English spoken at ticket counters, refund on plastic card/ticket at end of use. Comfy and clean train. Make sure you get on the one that has only one stop."
25,5.0,Trains and subways are very easy to use and much cheaper than taxis. You can get a subway/train card and load money on it as needed.
26,5.0,"Took a train from Busan to Seoul. Ticket priced at 59,800 won per pax for economy class.Train depart on time and it’s very clean and cosy ride. Instead of taking domestic flight, this is another option to consider.Merry Xmas!"
27,5.0,"Going off from the title, I was relax and have my own time, but because it was so comfortable, my 2 hour ride felt like 10 minutes and helped me realize the simplicity and benefits of riding this. 10/10 definitely would recommend to others."
28,5.0,Perfect way to get from Soeul to Busan.    Very comfortable three hour trip.  Runs regularly..  Great way to see the countryside.
29,5.0,"High-speed KTX trains are a fast and comfortable way to travel to Busan.  With a top speed of 305 km/h (190 mph), the KTX-Sancheon is the second commercial high-speed train operated in South Korea and the first domestic high-speed train that is designed and developed in South Korea.  Travel time is approximately 2-1/2 hours.  A limited number of KTX trains run directly from Incheon Airport to Busan.  Service from Seoul Station in Central Seoul to Busan is more frequent and more convenient.  You can make your reservations for a seat or standing room directly or over the internet at a discount.  We made seat reservations over the internet."
30,4.0,"Its definitely a must if you travel out of Seoul, because subway will took forever and confusing if the same colour subway line had a split in route, the subway captain will only report in Korean! Although it's expensive but consider the distance and speed, I feel it is justified. Comfortable and hassle free. If you can't get a seated ticket, there is few cabinet where you can seat provided if is not occupied.One great thing I notice is KTX or ITX station. Lift is link all the way to ground level! OK for baby stroller or handicap, you will greatly appreciate this! Carrying baby stroller climbing those staircase are a nightmare!!!Enjoy my ride! But hope that the train ticket conductor can communicate in English will be a plus!"
31,5.0,"if you dnt want to be lost in KTE stations, a navigational map is a must because train line inter change a lot.  There is an english translator in every stop.  Slow pace on the right side."
32,5.0,"Korean train system is one of the best in the world. They are fast, on time, and clean. If you need to travel around Korea this is the way to go."
33,3.0,"If you are going to Busan, do take this train which takes 2 hours & 40 minutes. I find that the flexi 2 day pass is useful & cheaper compared to purchase single trip. However, this is not a bullet train so it actually quite slow as compared to shinkansen."
34,5.0,"If you're used to cheap train travel in many other parts of the world, the ticket prices in Korea may be a shock, but it was good value given the reliability, comfort, on-board wifi and speed to get all over the country.  When we accidentally left a shopping bag on one of the overhead racks, we were directed to lost & found where we showed out seat number & asked if they found it to send it to the train station in Busan where we were headed a few days later.  To my amazement when we went to lost & found on arrival in Busan a few days later, the lovely staff had our bag waiting for us!"
35,5.0,"Clean, fast, reliable trains. The only issue is you get your single ticket deposit back of 500 won and I had 5 people, so I was constantly carrying around a pile of change."
36,5.0,"Went from Busan to Seoul on the KTX and found the ride to be smooth and quiet, internet access is provided. Get in early if you have a lot of luggage to secure."
37,5.0,Rook the KTX to Busan area. It was super easy and a pleasure to ride. Model of transportation. Great job Korea.
38,5.0,"Not much to say except that it did not disappoint. It was modern, clean and very efficient. If you get a chance to get on one, don't miss it."
39,2.0,"Just checked my online transactions and viola! they charged me around 200,000 KRW.  This is due to their erroneous and not so friendly website.  Note: I have purchased Korail Pass."
40,4.0,"First class is definitely better.Convenient and fast,would recommend, we left our large luggage behind,could be better with some food offering"
41,5.0,"The high speed train service of Korea.KTX connects major cities in the country.Seats aren't luxurious. But, fast and easy to use.I think this is the best way to travel Korea in case you don't drive."
42,4.0,"Have ridden KTX's all over Korea, especially the Seoul-Daegu and Seoul-Ulsan, and Seoul-Busan route - all less than 3 hours. KTX gets you to big cities fast, and on time. The downsides: high cost (about $50 one-way Seoul-Busan), and lack of knee space. if you can spare the extra money, splurge on the First Class seats!"
43,4.0,busan - seoul in 2.5hours with comfortable seat. board 15-20min before departure time so you can find best spot to keep your luggage. there are limited spaces at the end of cabins for bigger luggage. the air conditioner is not working so well during summer. wifi and usb charging point available. toilet looked clean but no water for handwash.
44,5.0,"Overall, we had a good experience on the KTX. One ride the a/c wasn't working well so they gave everyone in our car a bottle of water.  The website takes a while to get use to and navigate. They could improve the website quite a bit."
45,5.0,"We took the train to Busan and then back to Seoul. It was fast, efficient, clean and quiet. Very easy 3-hour journey."
46,4.0,"in 2017 my Family travel to Japan. and in this June 2018 we travel to Korea.KTX is OK. But in Japan people are quieter. In Korea, I found people talk louder and some people didn't bother to watch the mobile phone without earphone, which makes the train ""noisy"". Older people have reserved seat. But if the reserved seat is full, I don't find the younger people willing to give up their seat (unlike in Japan where all young people seems to right away give their seat to elderly / those in need). Also there are no Officer in Korea Station where we can ask question. The signage not as clear as Japan. In Japan there are officer who were very helpful to both local and tourist."
47,5.0,Ticket can pre-book via ktx website and it is very convenient and save a lot of time let you visit more places
48,5.0,My family and I took the KTX from Seoul to Busan. Purchasing tickets was extremely easy and convenient. The train ride itself was smooth and comfortable. A really wonderful way to travel to Busan.
49,4.0,"My family went to Korea in late March. I didn't want to buy a Korail pass as we only needed a one way ride from Seoul to Busan.Ticket seat reservation opens only 1 month prior and navigating their site is easy enough but there is a difference.With the English page, you can't choose your car or seat number. It is randomly chosen by the system for you, which was a no go for me as I wanted seats near the luggage storage areas. The Korean page however is more comprehensive. I tried it out using google translate and it allowed for a wider range of options including choosing your car and seat number. Downside though is that you have to input a local Korean contact number to be able to reserve it. So in the end, I had our guide, TOP Korea, reserve it for me because I couldn't do it myself. Senior citizen discount was availed of for my parents because I booked thru Amy of TOP Korea thru the Korean page. The English page doesn't have this option.Things to note:1. You print out the ticket and that's it. You don't need to change it for any actual ticket like with other countries. Ours wasn't even checked while on board. Maybe because they could see we weren't local.2. Car and seat counting is in reverse for the Seoul to Busan trip. Car 20 is first and Car 1 is last. Same with seats, row 1 is the last per car.3. Luggage storage areas are limited for the economy cars. I was told by our guide they are generally located between cars 5-7. We took the KTX 251 for Seoul to Busan and we used up all the luggage storage area in between our car, for our luggage alone so yes, it's limited. Over head areas can store backpacks and a smaller sized luggage but was made of see through glass like material so it's better if it isn't too heavy. Their is no space to store luggage behind the last row of chairs per car on KTX 251. We checked out KTX 117 before it left and it seemed to have space. So it's different per train I guess unlike with Japan wherein you can store big luggage behind the last row.4. Arrive early if you have big luggage, the luggage storage areas are also used for product shipments as we saw on our trip. Our train was ready for boarding 30 minutes prior to our trip so we just boarded ahead of time to make sure we had luggage space.5. No food cart on KTX 251 so if you want food, buy at one of the food stalls before boarding the train. There are around 8 food stall stands at the top of the stairs before going down to the platform. More inside the station building itself.6. Navigating the station is clear cut, everything is marked clearly. Boards have announcements constantly updated with English. Boarding area of the KTX trains is pretty small and also clearly designated so you won't get lost. No problem at all even if the personnel don't understand or speak English.Overall, it was a clean, smooth, on time train ride."
50,5.0,"We took the KTX to Busan and had a great experience. It was easy to book tickets online, and then all we had to do when we got there was board the train. No lines, no problems. It was a great trip."
51,4.0,"Excellent experience. It was fast, clean and fuss free. But as we were travelling with large pieces of luggage, I found that we were not able to find allocation space to store it during our journey."
52,4.0,"Took an early train at 5.30am from Seoul Station to Busan to catch a bus ride to  Changwon city to visit cherry blossom boulevards. The KTX trip lasted 3 hours and each was allocated a comfortable seat. If you missed your breakfast, don’t worry you can buy fastfood at Seoul station and eat it on the express train. There are overhead racks to keep your belongings. Quite a nice experience."
53,5.0,"The KTX trains are high speed, and affordable to get from PyeongChang to the airport was 2.5 hours and only about $27 US for an economy seat."
54,5.0,"During our 2-week stay in Seoul, we used the train 3 times: from airport to Seoul, from Seoul to Bushan and to Suwan.  I don't know about the ticket booking hassle for foreigners (as mentioned by other reviewers) as my 2 family members live and work there.  They booked and paid for everything for us :).The main train station in Seoul is the Seoul Station, which is connected to the metro.  This makes traveling very easy.  The train is nice and clean and with air conditioning.    The train is also washrooms equipped.  Seats are comfortable with enough leg room. There is also free wifi connection.  During longer ride to Bushan (2 hours), we brought light snacks and drink.  It was relaxing.At Seoul station, there are a few fast food restaurants, convenient stores, souvenir stores and stores that sell nic nac. There are also lockers for people to store their luggage.  However it is difficult to find an unoccupied one.  You can store your luggage at a storage place but it is more expensive."
55,5.0,"We were going to Busan via KTX. We chose economy and it's surprisingly enough! The seat is fine, comfortable enough and there's a tray that can hold 3 drinks and 2 take-outs. There's also a vending machine and restrooms. The restroom can be smelly but bearable."
56,4.0,"We took from Seoul Station to Busan and back 3 days later.Tried to book online but can't find 2 day flexible group pass. Went to Seoul Station to get it done. You will need your passport or a copy or picture (in your phone) of passport information page if you are buying for others.You have to buy the pass from ticketing office and book your departures from the counter. The fare for Flexible 2 Day Use Pass an adult is 91,000 Won, teenage 81,000 Won and child 51,000 Won. Flexible 2 day use pass have to be used within 10 days from first departure date. Your ticket will have your departure  date, time, train, car and seat number printed. The platform number will be on the screen about an hour or so before your departure time.Be ready at your car number area as if you at the wrong end.. it can be a long walk or run. Luggage space is very limited. But if you have cabin size bag, it can be place in the overhead rack above your seat. Train was very quiet and smooth. Even the announcement on board was soft. Hardly noticed it pulled up and out from stations along the way. The wifi on board was working on the way to Busan but back to Seoul it wasn't. Tried to informed the conductor but she didn't understand me. Most bring their own snacks and drinks on board."
57,4.0,"In general, it was an effective means of public transportation.  It connects to major cities in SK.  Lots of local people use it during weekends too so you need to plan ahead to avoid the 'sold-out' situation.  Remember this is not the tube in the UK or MTR in HK or MRT in S'pore, or other subway systems in Thailand, Malaysia, etc.The train station and the train itself do not have a lot of English support but some intelligent guesses will help you survive.The bathrooms could be better.  And I guess it really depends on the time of the day and when the train starts services.  There were times that they stink like crazy.   The concourse could be better by installing more fans to enhance the experience.  The heat was really killing us while waiting for the train.About getting tickets, if you have a fixed schedule, I strongly advise you to get tickets ahead of time at the station or online to avoid the 'sold out' situation or 'standing' situation.  Even if you are willing to pay, they just do not have the availabilities.  It is especially tough when your kids are asleep or exhausted.  The Korean would not let you take or share their seats.  Some local also cheat their way in as you do not need to scan to come in.  Or if you in a hurry, hop onto the train first and wait till the ticketing member to come around who sometimes has you buy your ticket right way (they have the little machine with them) or if you are lucky enough, s/he just walks by and you can save some money right there.The train staff members are generally helpful even enough they have very limited English.  The lady I met came apologized to me for the fact that the train was full and could not get my child a seat."
58,4.0,Train was comfortable and very quiet but was a bit stuffy. Train left on time and arrived at Seoul Station on time. Train crew came round every half hour or so serving drinks and snacks (at a cost). Train was also very clean and toilets were surprisingly good for train toilets.
59,3.0,"I purchased eight 3-day ktx pass online. This part was the easy one. When I reached Incheon Airport, I decided to make a reservation at the ktx counter there for the 8 passes/vouchers for 3rd dec to 5 dec. One would need the hardcopy of the transaction and the visa card plus the passports to exchange for the passes. It took a while but the staff there spoke English and i was reminded not to lose the passes as they are not replaceable. We were also told to go to Seoul Station just 15mins before departure to board the train. On the 3rd Dec, we appeared at Seoul Station one hour before departure time and our nightmare began. We went to the ktx counters to check our train and which track we should take. They said that what we had were just the passes and because that day was a saturday, the trains would all be full and only standing is available. No one can imagine standing for 2.5 hours and my mum (close to 80yrs old) was also travelling with us. We kept insisting that we already had our reservation made at the Incheon Ktx counter but to no avail. The Seiul Station ktx counter just shoved us to the information counter. And this back and forth between the ktx counter and information counter went on for a good 30mins. Finally, the man who was supposedly in charge of the information counter spoke to us in some simple English. But he was of no help, he said that he knows the system very well and there is no such thing as reservation at the Incheon airport station and there is why our reservation cannot be detected. Sigh....He tried to call the Incheon ktx side but they just said that the staff who served was not on duty then. We were really panicking beacuse we were going to miss our 12pm train. Just then, the i/c seemed to stumble upon our reservation, spoke korean to his colleagues then called the Incheon staff again. The Incheon staff now said that we should have received some tickets if reservation were made.  They seemed to have change their stance and said that tickets should have been issued. However, the Seoul i/c guy still insisted that reservation could not be made at the Incheon side. We were totally confused by then and missed our reserved train but we were resolute about going to Busan inspite of the hiccups.Finally, we took the 1230 train. The counter staff managed to find one seat for my eldely mum. As for the rest of us, we stood or sat on the floor in between the carriages for most of our journey. For our return trip, we made sure we had the tickets and it was a no event. I was still wondering what went wrong. Was there no reservation at Incheon ktx station done? The lady seemed to know what she was doing. It was only on my last day in Seoul when I wad clearing my pouch that the mystery was solved. I found the tickets!!!! It was my poor memory that i have safely tucked away the tickets thinking that the passes were enough ( from my experience with Japan pass). So indeed the reservation was made and tickets issued. So why did the system not detect my reservation and why did the Seoul counter staff insisted that resetvation cannot be done at the Incheon side. They should really brush up the system and services otherwise more first time tourists will suffer the same plight as me. Of course, I also need to brush up my memory too."
60,4.0,"We took the KTX from Busan to Seoul. The KTX station was nice, with shops that you can explore while you wait for your train. The trains looked older though, compared to the bullet trains in Japan. Our young child enjoyed the ride."
61,5.0,one of the best high speed train. ride was smooth and on schedule. My family and I was travelling from seoul to busan and it takes around 2.5 hours to reach busan. The staff at the seoul station was attentive enough to entertain us.
62,5.0,Very smooth journey from Seoul to Busan. Drinks trolley with beer and coffee followed by snacks trolley - nice! Lots of fast food options to take on the train from Seoul station. Easy way to travel
63,4.0,I took a KTX train from Seoul to Busan. I didn't realise it has already departed if i haven't look out from the window. It was so quiet and smooth when it started. Depart right on time and comparatively cheaper than the domestic flight. Fast and efficient. Food sold on the coach. Toilet available. Clean and cosy. Highly recommendable.
64,5.0,"Took KTX to Busan and back to Seoul. The process is pretty simple. I booked a 3 days KORAIL Pass online. If you have more than 3 in your group, you are entitled to saver promotion. There are other promotion such as youth and etc. Simply check through the website. The pass allows u to use KTX multiple times within the 3days. Print out your booking details and exchange for a PASS at any KTX station (I did it at Seoul station). Then go to ticket counter, simply present your pass and book your tickets with coach number and seat number stated. The train is clean and cozy. Toilet is available. There will be food and drinks available for selling. If not you may pack your food at Seoul station. You will see many food stalls along the way to the platform. An easy way to move around in Korea."
65,5.0,"Traffic in Korea is horrific, and if you are leaving the city this is the only way to go. Efficient, safe, comfortable, and fast. Honestly, is the KTX (or ITX) can get you anywhere near your destination in Korea, there is simply no reason to travel any other way."
66,5.0,"This was the first time we rode the KTX high speed rail. I was expecting to be a little rocky but it was soo Smooth.  We rode it from Seoul to Busan.  It was a fun experience and it has FREE wifi on the train.  If you are going to travel around the country, this is the way for you to go.  It was also great for our young children to experience it as well.  In addition there is assigned seating. So, no stress to find out where to sit."
67,5.0,"LOVED taking the KTX bullet train from Seoul to Busan!  WOW...so fast...so quiet!  I DO recommend paying a little bit more for the ""first class""  MUCH more roomier....and quieter.  Totally worth the extra expense for the ride!  the only downside...;we had to go to Seoul Station to purchase the tickets.  The website didn't allow non-korea citizens to purchase it when you can purchase it at the station....totally inconvenient but the ride made up for it!  Plus....there was good shopping at Seoul Station!  :o)"
68,5.0,"We visited Seoul and planned a one day tour to Busan. The main purpose was to travel by the superfast KTX Train to Busan and back. The day before the travel, I went to the Seoul Central Station to book the tickets. There are seperate booking counters for KTX Trains. When I approached the counter I was told that three return tickets to Busan would cost me about 275,000/- Korean Won. I had read somewhere on the net that I can get it cheaper if I purchased a KoRail Pass. So I asked the lady at the counter about it and she directed me to contact the KoRail office next door. I went there and I was told that I can buy KoRail Passes valid for one day, three days or seven days with which I can travel by any train inside korea including KTX any number of times within the validity period. I was told that the procedure was to first buy the appropriate KoRail pass by showing your Passport and making the payment. Please note that KoRail passes are available only for foreigners. I took a one day KoRail Pass as I intended to return the same day. It cost me about 65,000/- Korean Won per person. Since my son was only 20 years old, the lady told me that he is entitled to a further Youth Discount and his pass cost me only about 56,000/- Won. Thus my total cost was only about 186,000 Korean Won for 3 persons as against the actual price of about 275,000/- won. After buying the KoRail Pass you have to go to the Information Counter right across and get the Pass activated for the particular day of Travel. It is advisable to check with the KoRail office about the availability of the tickets to the place you wish to travel on the specified dates. After activating the pass, you should go back to the KTX reservation counter and block your seats in the trains you prefer. All this took me less than 20 minutes to complete and the saving was enormous. KTX operates superfast trains to Busan and back almost every half an hour. Hence, if tickets are full in one train, you can opt for the next. You are also permitted to change the trains after reservation if seats are available without payment of any extra cost. But always carry the KoRail Pass with you for making such changes. We took the 7:00 AM train to Busan and it was a pleasant experience. The train stops in almost 5 or 6 stations.The maximum speed achieved was 302 kmph. Once the speed crosses 250 kmph, the same will be displayed in the TV screen inside the compartment. The train maintains an average speed of 250 to 270 kmph. At stretches it will go past 290 or 300 kmph. There are a number of long tunnels enroute and the scenery is average. The time taken to cover the distance is 2 hours and 15 minutes. They serve snacks and drinks in the train which can be purchased. I feel that it is worth the experience."

70,4.0,"I took the KTX from Busan upto Seoul and it was a real time saver- ideal for the business traveller and for anyone short on time. ^^ The seats are comfortable, plenty of leg room in first class and large suitcases can be accommodated behind the last row of seats in any the cabin. Food and drinks are available in the train, but you're free to bring your own snacks too. The train is reliable and on time, and you can even book your tickets up to a month in advance online. If you're looking for a great view from the windows though, you're out of luck on this leg (Busan-Seoul), since you'll mostly be passing through tunnels at first. The only other downside was the cleanliness factor- it could do with some sprucing up."
71,4.0,We went to Busan for 4D/3N trip from 29 Mar - 02 Apr 16. Booked the KTX from Seoul to Busan first class from Seoul Station counter.  The ride was comfortable. The seat and leg room was wide. There's free mini bottled water from the vending machine. It's about 2.5hrs journey. Fastest way to travel to Busan besides the plane. Nice view.
72,5.0,Nice clean and efficient way to travel quickly to different faraway places in Korea. From Seoul Station (lots of shopping here too) we took train to visit Daegu. Daegu station is fairly new also. Got us there within 2 hours but make sure to buy tickets in advance at the station cause seats are reserved and can get booked up especially weekend or holiday. Can't buy online unless you are native to Korea.
73,5.0,"We took the KTX from Seoul to Busan. Booked the first class. Leg room, wide seat and high back support.Free water from the vending machine betweent the carriage. Do come early if you have luggage, as the luggage tray is very small and only available in 2 between 4 carriage.Do travel with KTX if you want convenience and realiability.Our First Class ticket was 150,000  per person for return ticket from Seoul to Busan"
74,5.0,Went from Seoul to Chenon in under 30 mins.... very economical compared to a taxi and much easier than taking a bus. The stations are state of the art and one feels they are in a world class airport. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Check out the free WiFi
75,3.0,"Had the privilege of travelling from Seoul to Daejong on ITX-Saemual and Daejong to Daegu on KTX. KTX cost twice as much for almost the same distance but took half the time compared to the slower trains (ITX or Mugunghwa). KTX trains are older and dirtier compared to the ITX trains. My seat had grim all over the stowaway table and the window seals. We were given seats which were backwards (half of the KTX trains have backward seats) but this was not the case on the ITX trains. Comfort levels of the ITX trains far exceed that on the KTX.Therefore, if you are tourist and not pressed for time, I would recommend the newer ITX-Saemaul trains or the Mugunghwa as means of transportation. Saves some money too."
76,5.0,"The train was a joy to travel on The courtesy of the staff, the cleanliness of the train  and above all the punctuality of the service..Superb   This regret ably cannot be said of trains here in uk.Korea  has much to teach us in many aspects of life.Courtesy  Respect  from young to the elderly and the Service one receives every where is exemplaryThe accommodation that the people live in is secondary  I would go again.to this forward looking country"
77,4.0,"The high-speed KTX line transports travelers from Seoul to Busan in a little over 2 ½ hours. Just a decade ago this used to take 5 hours on a conventional train or a few unpredictable hours on a domestic flight. It’s a convenient and relatively inexpensive way to get to major cities in Korea. A round trip ticket costs a little over KRW100,000. There are discounts for families (you need a resident number) and senior citizens.Unlike many American trains, your ticket comes with a seat assignment, both car # and seat number. It’s important to sit in your assigned seat because that’s how the conductors “take attendance”. Your ticket is not ever checked at a gate or by a conductor unless there is some kind of dispute. The trains are equipped with TVs but the programming (news, safety announcements and human interest) is hard to hear and exclusively in Korean. The TVs regularly show your train’s speed, which can exceed 300km/hr on occasion.A couple of suggestions: bring water or be prepared to buy it. Especially in the winter, the trains are very hot and dry to the point of discomfort. If you are not used to this it can make for a difficult trip. You will be amazed at how others can sleep soundly and comfortably in their winter coats in a 30+ degree (Celsius) train car! Another suggestion: seating...there are 15 rows in your standard car. Rows 1 through 7 face southwards and therefore forwards as you leave Seoul to Busan. Rows 10 through 15 face forward as you travel North. Families can sit in rows 8 and 9 facing one another with a table in between. Last thing – the trains leave on time so don’t be late! Your fellow travelers can be pretty frazzled and pushy. Don't let this get to you and enjoy the trip."
78,5.0,"We have used the KTX train to travel in South Korea twice, once in 2011 between Seoul and Gwanju and just recently (2014) to travel between Seoul and Busan.  It is an excellent service which is very easy to use (especially for non Korean speakers and is very cost effective.  The trains are extremely punctual, clean and feature a food cart service that you can purchase snacks and beverages from.  The KTX travels at up to 350km/h so the trips are quick :-)"
79,5.0,"I use the KTX twice when i visited korea Busan--Seoul--Busan. The train is awesome as japanese would say sugoi!!! Thought the seat is smaller than the japanese shinkansen, it is still comfortable even for a big size person like me :P I never knew there were diffrent type of KTX (depend on fare price and duration)I took the longest one around 3 hours 20 minutes. Its the cheapest around 46,000 won. The most expensive is around 59,000 if i'm not mistaken. It takes about 2 hours plus.To board KTX from busan subway station (line 1) you'll see KTX sign, head out of busan subway station, you'll see busan square and the big busan station.Oh yeah during peak season tickets are sold fast. So make early reservation. We had our hostel booked for us."
80,4.0,"We traveled as a family of 4 from Busan (Pusan) to Seoul. We prebooked tickets via the website korail.com about 1 week before leaving Australia. If your credit card company is on the ball, they may contact you to question this ""unauthorised"" transaction!! Initially, I thought that once you had submitted your details for the trip, then the tickets had been purchased. This is NOT the case. What ACTUALLY happens is that Korail takes your details and only charges you when you physically go to the nearest korail station to collect the tickets. N.B. The ""confirmation"" email is NOT the actual ticket. In other words, when you book online, Korail ""holds"" or ""reserves"" the tickets for you. What this means is that you may cancel your tickets without penalty (if you cancel greater than 48 hours before the actual departure time). If you cancel closer to the departure time, there are varying rates of penalty. You can change or cancel your booking online. A few tips:-- book ahead, otherwise your group will not be seated together. There doesn't seem to be a way to ""select"" seats. - the website appears to be in Korean, but clicking the right sided button on the opening screen and then selecting the top right hand language button on the subsequent screen will allow you to progress in English. - if you cancel, make sure you cancel at least 48 hours prior to departure. To cancel, you will need your passport number, name and nationality. - certain routes to the same destination are cheaper, but will take longer. - it cost about $20 usd extra per person to travel from Busan to Seoul first class by the shortest route compared to economy by the fastest route. Each ticket was about $70 USD- first class gives you a larger allocated seat. We received nothing extra in terms of refreshments or service. For short trips, I don't think it's really worthwhile. - if you are travelling with large suitcases, embark carriage at least 15 minutes before departure. Space for large luggage is limited and you might be travelling with those suitcases on your lap if you don't get in quick!!- there is overhead compartment space for hand luggage. - allow plenty of travel time to get to the station. In our experience, traffic conditions are very unpredictable. You must allow time to find the actual ticket office. - subway stations are not KTX stations. You cannot pay for your KTX tickets at ordinary subway stations. - you can pay for your KTX ticket just prior to boarding. It is not necessary to have to make an additional trip there the day before. - my advice is to try to avoid using the toilets on the train. First class or otherwise, they're pretty foul at times. Ours was backed up!!- if you're paranoid about your reservation NOT being received, you can check online. Also, you should receive a confirmation email. - the trains are super punctual. Do NOT be late!!Have an awesome trip!"
81,4.0,"I have traveled on the KTX on a Korail Pass. The first time was in first class (we upgraded for 10,000 won) and other times economy.  Not worth the upgrade.  The only difference was free water and the aisles were wider with seat configuration of 2 and 1. Fewer rows. The leg room was sufficient in economy. Snacks were not free.  Having traveled first class by train in Canada and Europe, was thinking there would be more to it, ie.  drinks, food, etc.  Not the case.  Seats in economy go frontwards and backwards.  If you need a forward facing chair, not sure how to guarantee that.  My husband was in another car,  7a.  He was backwards.  I was in 7a too, facing forwards.  Travel tip.  Book early for Friday travel.  I was traveling with family-3 of us and we booked only 1 day ahead and were not able to sit together.  There is wifi on board. Only 1 hour-per device.  The login info is in korean, so plan to be kicked out.  One device only had 10 mins, then was kicked out."
82,4.0,This is super easy to get around Korea. It is very cheap too. I didn't mind the ride and much better than driving.
83,4.0,"I purchased three tickets online 1 month before I visited South Korea. I used KTX from Busan to Seoul. I payed 54.400 won and it's quite expensive for me (as a student college :D ) but I knew this would be my first time experience to try the fastest train in Korea. The journey took only less than 3 hr from Busan to Seoul.The train was so comfortable, with high-speed wifi in every car. You can see speed monitor on television above ( and I excited to see the speed reached 300 km/h, wow..)It was a smooth trip, even I didn't realize that now I was in train with high speed.Seats was so nice and comfy."
84,4.0,"the KTX from Seoul to Gyoengju or beyond is the way to get to the South East. Very fast, French trains by Alstom, very cheap...$44 reserved seat to Singyeongju... and exactly on time. We left Seoul after our driving friends by two hours and even after the 45 min bus ride from the station to the Gyeongju Hilton we arrived at the same time within a few minutes. As with the TGV recommend taking your own refreshments although they are available on board. Way to travel."
85,5.0,We booked a seat in 1st class for about $46. It had outlets for your computer and plenty of leg room. If you are going on a long trip this is the only way to go. Also buy food at one of the restaurants at the station to bring on-board - better than the food you could buy on the train.
86,5.0,"The KTX is clean, efficient and fairly economical. We traveled from Seoul Station to Busan Station and it took only 2 hours and 30 minutes. We experienced speeds of up to 301 kmh! A wonderful way to travel across South Korea!"
87,5.0,I really loved the convenience of schedule and the efficiency of this train. We should have these in North America too. I prefer traveling by train than plane.
88,5.0,"We went out to the countryside and it was easy to get a ticket and only $16 to go to the other side of South Korea.  The bus is very plush.  It fills up and then you must wait for the next one, so buy your ticket in advance if you have a particular time you want to travel, rather than just showing up to get a ticket."
89,5.0,"The KTX is high speed rail as it should be.  They are on schedule right to the second.  Clean, efficient and friendly.  50000 won from Seoul to Busan at 300 km/h,  It is the way to travel in the ROK."
90,5.0,"very stable and quiet... the speed shown on the overhead TV, it is just fast and easy, Free Wifi in train, i use google map and see my dot flying on the map... !!"
91,5.0,"Used KTX to get from Seoul to Ulsan and back.  Extremely smooth ride, and very fast.  Best way to get around Korea."
92,5.0,"I went on the KTX when visiting Busan from Seoul. It isn't like an attraction. Its just like an express train that is completely smooth and quiet. You will get to you destination in no time. I had a nice sleep while on it. On board, they sell food and drinks - people come around with carts full of them. But of course you have to pay. But only for the original price you would get them everywhere else. :)"
93,5.0,Fast and efficient service to take me to cities outside Seoul.
94,4.0,"My family (of 4) took KTX train to travel between Seoul and Busan. I was warned by my Korean friend that if we want to sit together we should book ahead using the Korail website.The economy class cars are normally full, so the advice about booking ahead was essential if you are travelling in a group.  I booked the train few days beforehand online, printed out the reservation page, went to Seoul Station and recieved the boarding pass at the counter. It was easy.The seats are a bit close together, the arm rest had to be shared. There are vending machines on the cars and toilets were average. We managed get on the train well before the recommended boarding time (15 mins before departure). We walked to the platform almost an hour beforehand and saw our train so we got in the train first. There aren't much luggage space on the train other than the overhead shelves, so I wouldn't recommend carrying large ""airport"" suitcases.Travelling at top speed of 304km/h, it had WiFi access and food carts. It took about 2 hours and 40 minutes to travel from Seoul to Busan."
95,5.0,The underground rail system is super efficient and speedy. Sometimes a little confusing finding exits but usually someone around to help if you are completely flummoxed.If staying for a few days investigate the T/money card - worked really well for all of us.
96,5.0,We took the KTX from Seoul Station to Daejeon for a day trip.  It was very easy.  No problems at all!  The trains were clean and comfortable.  We'd definitely ride again.
97,4.0,We bought tickets from Seoul to Busan on the day of travel without problems. Train ride was quick and quiet. Food and drink trolleys passed by regularly.
98,5.0,Very fast and efficient way to see the country.  Trains are on time and clean but there is not much room for storing large cases.
99,3.0,"It is a ok way to travel, the train speed was most of the time about 270 km and very few times it went up to 305 km, but I can recomend it even though they say the train can go up 350 km per hour.The compartment was nice and clean and so where the restrooms."
