We showed our passports to get in and walked out a few minutes later and told the lady who looked at our passport it was very hot and unbearable inside and as we continued walking out, instead of saying sorry or being professional we overheard her telling the male companions who also work with her at the entrance and she started laughing about situation. She is just a bad apple in a bunch because we have many Korean friends and understand the culture but this is what you should expect here.  He casino itself is like the size of a extra big basketball court, a very few slots on one end and the other 80-85 percent of the other end has table games.  If you really want to visit a casino go to walker hill very classy hotel with art inside casino on other."
1,1.0,"Manager song yong bum and staff hong snae was exceptionally rude to hotel guests at Oakwood Premier.  Will never stay at Oakwood premier again and do not recommend spending $$ at the seven luck casino.  Was denied entrance to casino because staff took it upon themselves to deny entrance because we looked like we were ""drunk"".  Obviously not the case since I was able to post this review right after being denied entrance.  It seems as if you do not speak Korean you are treated with poor service and rude staff. I recommend you should not stay at this hotel or waste your money at this casino.  Park Hyatt would be my suggestion.  Great brunch and high regards for service."
