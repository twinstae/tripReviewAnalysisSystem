Very near the East gate, so makes for a good visit for both. After visiting museum, you can exit onto the wall and walk up it for an excellent city view."

The museum is housed in a beautifully designed modern building and exhibits are spread out over three levels.  The permanent collections can be found on the first and third floor, on the second was a temporary exhibition which we skipped due to time.  We found all the exhibits thoroughly interesting, the story of the wall, how the location was chosen, construction process and how the wall needed to  change as the city expanded and modernised to incorporate a tramway. The use of multi-media made our visit 45 minute visit thoroughly enjoyable: 3D relief models with special LED lighting, videos, photographs, artifacts. The animated videos were wonderful to watch giving the viewer a good impression of the history and construction of the wall, there was plenty to read in English and if not the exhibits spoke for themselves. It was a pleasure to visit this museum which was very peaceful with few visitors, my kind of museum.  We exited the building on the third floor which took us immediately out to the wall and we hiked up to Naksan Park and beyond."

I enjoyed learning that during each time period, different wall construction was used.  I looked for this as I explored the wall.  I also enjoyed seeing the small statues that were on top of one of the gates.  In my Seoul City Wall video you can see both the different wall construction and figures.  Just search for Amy Moncure."
