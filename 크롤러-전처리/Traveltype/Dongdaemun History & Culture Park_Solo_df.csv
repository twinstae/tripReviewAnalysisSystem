However, there is a small park just behind the plaza, with many free seats with umbrella covers. It was quiet with only a few people around. A good place to rest your legs and enjoy the peace there."
1,3.0,Building looks good. Some shops inside the building selling design related products. Museum was closed on the Monday I was there. A lot of empty space inside the building. Not sure it's the best use of space. People sitting and strolling outside in the plaza area. Ok for 1 hour at most just to see what's inside the building and walkaround
2,4.0,A very nice place to walk around in which you can witness the past history blending in with the current present. In which how each finds a balance yet preserving the traditional culture.
3,4.0,"Architecture is interesting and worth seeing. There are museums, galleries for interested people. Also location is easily accessible, not far from shopping district, possible to find something to eat within complex area."
4,5.0,"Nice exhibition! and lots of thing to experience. The popular one seems like the LV exhibition since they are free and full of knowledge about it. Highly recommending to pre register since the line is quite crazy!Next one is, 30 Pixar animation company anniversary. I pay 13,000W for getting into their 30 anniversary exhibition its worth my money! Inside of exhibition, you will learn all about their cartoon, the process to make it.Sorry they not allow to take photo inside of that!. Trick&tip : use the toilet before you get in, you can't re-entry Aside of those, DDP also have the design market and lots of things to explore. Take the subway and come to DDP exit 1"
5,5.0,Quite amazing exterior designs of the buildings whilst preserving some very old ancient ruins. Look out for the stunning display of white roses and the extra large suit case.Taking a selfie of a selfie with the extra large camera on display is great fun too.
6,4.0,Good mix of history: the old city walls in Seoul and the contemporary: the Dongdaemun Design Plaza. Recommended!
7,4.0,"Totally a ""city park"" with high-rises of the Dongdaemun area in the close vicinity, this is not much of a place for relaxation & recreation but worth stopping by while in the very-lively (especially in the evening) Dongdaemun area around the big intersection of Jangchungdan-ro & Eulji-ro streets (where the Park is on one side of the intersection) which definitely is a ""should-not-miss"" area with: big department stores like Lotte & Doota, an evening outdoor market (with mobile kiosks spread out here & there along the sidewalk on one side of Jangchungdan-ro stretching north from the big intersection), Cheonggyecheon Stream (a well-known beautiful & yes ""very long"" stream going through the city in the east-west direction from slightly under the ground level, the area near this park is like an eastern section of the stream just about a 5-to-10-minute walk from the big intersection) and the Great East Gate (officially known as Heunginjimun which you'll get to pretty much right after crossing the Stream coming from the big intersection).And being not much for a leisure walk as mentioned above, the Park has some ""super-sized"" displays on its grounds such a vase and a luggage trunk (with a big padlock on one side & a big key on top as well) and also a ""fairly big"" area with artificial white roses (among the real green grass!) which I found sort of ""pleasing to the eyes"" despite knowing the flowers were not real.  Also, right beside the Park is Dongdaemun Design Plaza (an interesting-shaped building which is like two ""big ovals"" joined together) that can be entered where you'll see the interior which is ""quite stunningly"" pretty-much-all-white (the walls, the ceilings, a great portion of the floor & even some displays themselves).Coming by subway, Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station (on Lines 2, 4 & 5) is where to get off; the best exit is Exit 1 where you'll see the Design Plaza right in front when you come out of the station, and just go around the building on the left side for a few minutes and you'll see on your right the park entrance (which is like between the two ovals)."
8,4.0,"A modern park that has been designed and built in a very modern forward thinking idea. It is quite a pleasant place to spend a bit of time walking round, a good few photo opportunities. I went inside and walked around some of the shops, but wasn't that impressed with the shops, but it was quite busy, so I suspect they are popular with the locals."
9,5.0,"Amazing space and architecture appeals. Many people just sit and chit chat, kind of blissful place in a city centre. Night is cooling but not bright enough, still I love it."
10,4.0,"Take a green line subway to visit this place. Very huge place, clean and calm. The futuristic architechture design of this place is amazing. You can see some artists works here, just walk around, have some coffee, playing piano, or just sit and feel calm near the park. If visit in the morning or day time, you can see some museums as well in this area."
11,5.0,"A very interesting place to walk around. The architecture is very unusual, the excavation of the city walls is very interesting and the lit flower garden is beautiful to behold, particularly at night."
12,5.0,"Worth the visit when you are in the Dongdaemun area, there is the LED rose garden and it was very pretty.  The Spaceship building is very modern and it changes colour very 3 to 4 minutes."
13,5.0,"A park that's not only acts as a breathing space for Dongdaemun , but is also complete with a museum on the stadium and the history of the area. Getting to see an actual floodway wall up close is a treat and a peek into the past of the area. A must visit in Dongdaemun, my home in Seoul !"
14,4.0,"The focal point of this area is the space-age building in the centre square, which was designed by an Iranian architect. During excavations they found may relics from ancient Korean culture, and these have been incorporated into the complex.  The complex hosts many cultural exhibitions and has shops showcasing the works of modern artists, in various mediums. I visited the Esprit Dior exhibition which was fantastic but is sadly finished. Last week I also visited the Andy Warhol Exhibition which was only mildly interesting as all the information on the wall was only in Korean (and it cost W15000 to get in), so I'd say this is for die-hard fans only. There are also many free displays around the place as well.Across the road there are many clothing shops which would mainly appeal to teens, 20's crowd and in the side streets are many local restaurants.  There are also a lot of wholesale clothing markets in the area if you are after some special textile  bargains.It is worth coming just to wander around and at the buildings, especially if you like photography, it makes a great subject."
