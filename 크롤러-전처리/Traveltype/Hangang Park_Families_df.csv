0,5.0,We rented a bike and cycled along the riverside. There are multiple hangang park and we went to yeoido which is easily accessible by a subway and needs only 15 mins walk. It is opposite building 61 and has rainbow bridge. It is very clean and has relaxing ambiance. Really rejuvenating place.
1,3.0,"Nice enough, and we rented bikes for a lovely afternoon. Services are limited, so pack food or go in the evening when the food trucks are open. Prepare for the crowds."
2,5.0,"Hangang is a wide river passing Seoul and there are several riverside parks along the river. It's a great chance to get refreshed for citizens and tourists watching the cityscape and enjoying activities.- There's no certain park named Hangang Park on the map. It consists of multiple riverside parks along the river. Of those parks near the river, Yeouido Hangang Park is the most famous with campaing grounds, river cruises, playgrounds, bicycle tracks, etc. Other ones have different satisfaction too.- It's also nice in the evening with the illuminations on bridges.- Hangang Park is a bit away from the touristic center, it takes some time to reach by bus, subway or driving.- Better not to visit during flood in summer."
3,5.0,Great view of the Han river. Spending time and camping could be done in the park. Renting of bicycle is available as well.
4,5.0,"We love going to the Hangang river and go often. We love to take a walk along the river or go to one of the many activities. Different activities are located at the bridges.   You can find things such as bike rentals, restaurants and festivals. The banpo bridge is great because during summer, spring and fall they have light/water show with music. This year they had food trucks there but previously we would order chicken from one of the guys on a scooter.  There are also restaurants and a kids cafe at Banpo brdige."
5,5.0,"My family love this park especially riding the cruise. We went there on Friday night, there were lots of people putting up their cute tent and camp there, eating ramen. The place is very close to metro station."
6,4.0,"A lot local people will have picnic there, can easily order food by if you can understand Korean words leaflet. Spring time you can see roses, lily and a lot poppy flower around the park."
7,4.0,"Visited the park just to watch the Banpo bridge Rainbow fountain and was cancelled. Nevertheless, it was such a different experience, to feel so local. This park is full of people, picnic with their friends, loved ones, family. We thought there were the street festival but apparently there isn't. We went to a convenient store and it was super long long q, u even need to q to get into the store. Inside all locals are grabbing instant noodles, beer and cooking them and finally settling it down by the river and enjoy their meal. It was very windy as well. There were lots of cyclists as well. Overall, it was a very nice experience for me to experience how local Koreans spent their weekends."
8,4.0,"The park is actually several parks that make up part of the national parks. For us, the park gave us some fantastic vantage points for photos as well as a great stroll."
9,5.0,We went twice: once to see the Banpo Bridge water show (which was cancelled b/c the river was mucky from rain) and the second time we rented bikes by the I SEOUL U sign. Biking along the river was so fun and so beautiful! Super relaxing. I highly recommend.
10,4.0,"We visited Hangang park at noon. Got some bikes inexpensively (sorry I forgot price) for 2 hours.Along the way there are playgrounds and convenience stores to rest and fuel up.There are also some fried chicken stores near the waterplay area. Saw many people who had fried chicken delivered to them but since we could not speak the language, we were unable to. Nevertheless the fried chicken store near the waterplay area (3rd floor, 2nd floor was a convenience store, and it faces a small carpark) was quite yummy."
11,5.0,"lovely place to spent with your lovely freinds or families, there is great park to walk or camp or picke and there is little Coffee sohp."
12,5.0,"Not sure if we are lucky but the night we came, there was a food festival, an hour concert, and a competition for rock climbing. Other than that, there are a few restaurants in the area and you can also rent bicycles to cycle around the park, however do note that the alignment of the wheels is not great and you will be trying to go straight the whole time, but it‚Äôs cheap. About 3000 won an hour. Oh yes. There are severe hangang park located along the river. We chose the banpo hangang park so that we can enjoy the water fountain show in the evening and night. There are different show timings for weekday and weekend, so heck the website."
13,4.0,"Although crowed most times, this area is a terrific park on the banks of the Han River and makes for some amazing city views. Beautiful gardens and seating areas allow a relaxing (as can be in busy times) place to sit and visit with family, or walk along the endless pathways. Campers can be found hanging out; bikers and skaters/bladers mix in and family picnics were everywhere. Can be chilly with the wind off the river but on a lesser polluted day, it is a lovely place to visit."
14,4.0,"Clean and kept up well despite the massive crowds this place attracts. Dog-friendly. A quintessential Seoul experience if you're visiting would be to enjoy a stroll along the river, find a spot on the grass to settle down, and order chicken delivery right to your blanket for an impromptu picnic."
15,5.0,"One of the best option if you want to escape from the routine and stress that a busy city like Seoul gives. You can take a brake and relax in the middle of the city and enjoy some beverages, a walk or even a romantic date here. I really recommend this environment to anyone who is at Seoul."
16,5.0,"Blend with the locals, prepare your mat, sandwiches or chimak and some drinks!Many people will pitching tents, sitting on the grass enjoying the food and drinks they brought! There will also be bicycle kiosks and people will renting to ride around the park!Enjoy the breeze and sunshine!(If the weather is good!)‚úåÔ∏èüòâ"
17,5.0,"Nice park after the long walk at yeouido Park. The walk on water pool is really awesome and amazing. Would be much greater if it was cherry blossom bloom, we just missed it by a week. The food truck gives pretty good selection and it has a vast area to enjoy your food. Do check out their event on the web before heading there."
18,4.0,"NIce place for kids to play snow sledging. More for family with children, unlimited play for minimum fee."
19,5.0,Hangang Park is awesome. If you like to go walk along the river and you are in Seoul you must go there. You can rent a bike or just walk. There are a lot of photo zones. I think that was the best park ever.Park nad rzekƒÖ Hangang to jeden z lepszych park√≥w. Mo≈ºna tam wypo≈ºyczyƒá rower i zrobiƒá mn√≥stwo zdjƒôƒá. Polecam!
20,5.0,What a great area. There wasn‚Äôt a lot of infrastructure such as playgrounds for kids but it leans toward people exercising. There was an area to exercise using the provided equipment as well as some equipment to use a skateboard.
21,5.0,"Each Han River Park may have different features, but if you do not have time to visit a specific one, try a nearest one. The promenade is very well paved, and the river is wide so you can feel the nature at the heart of Seoul. You can rent a bike too. The wind can be strong in the winter, so be well prepaired."
22,4.0,A peaceful and quiet park and which is suitable for jogging!  We came here during winter and there were not many people except minimal joggers.  The winter view is great with lovely trees along the park.
23,5.0,"I went there around evening and having my ride, it cost me 10000 won per hour. you can enjoy the nice view from the river and it have many activities. it also have many cruise that u can having your dinner inside the cruise. you can also choose for food delivery that are very convenience. if u cant speak korean is ok, there also many road stall that u can purchase food"
24,5.0,"Enjoyed walking along the river, coffee stop and deep fried chicken there. There is a night market held after sunset (check the date and time) and we enjoyed many street food (but not very cheap). A bit difficult to find tables and seats, but it was fun. Also fountain from the lighted bridge was fantastic."
25,4.0,"As the review below, it seems like there is nothing to do in hangang itself. Only river, and track to run or for bike. But let me give you tips to enjoy Seoul like a local. 1. If you want to explore hangang, there are plenty of options. You can take one day kayak class, or just rent a kayak in Ttukseom recreation area, which is western side of river. 2. You can also have a cruise dinner while enjoying the beautiful night view of Seoul. There are some restaurants able to do this. 3. What does real local people do? After work, we run to river with chicken and beer, and enjoy ChiMak (we call Chimak for fried chicken + beer) watching river!"
26,5.0,"the Hanang Park is a nice place and there is water and you can go and stay there for a couple of days. And there is a big sign that says I SEUOL U, but to get to the sign it is a 10 min walk from the entrance, it was a very nice long walk, but it was hot. Along the way to going to the sign we came across stores, food shop, lots of tents, rental bikes and people flying kites. And the nice thing is that most of the people brought tents and they were sitting in there tents eating and thee wasn't even one spot that they littered or that they made dirty, everything was SO CLEAN, even the stores and the shop.I recommend you come in the night because it will be a very nice place. I recommend the Hangang park"
27,4.0,We went there at evening because it was too hot to visit the park at daytime during summer. There were a lot of visitors both local and foreign. It was good for walking along the river. There were also many different activities offered at night time.
28,5.0,"Hangang Park is like other parks adjacent to a river, however this park is designed with a couple of commercial structures that light up at night, galleries of food trucks and a view of the Bampo bridge that illuminates at night with water display show. Definitely recommend."
29,5.0,"The Hangang Park is actually the entire system of parks and biking/walking path that parallels the Han River and tributaries on both sides all throughout and beyond Seoul.  Rent a bike (available at stations throughout town or at shops on the river) and spend a few hours just riding along the path to take in the sights.  Sometimes its even faster than car or subway.  Some notable areas are the path around the Banpo bridge, particularly at night when they put on a lighted water fountain display.  Picnics are also a great way to enjoy the park."
30,4.0,"There's plenty to do at the Hangang Park, that is if you have the time.WE took the subway to Yeouinaru station and got out at exit 2.This is where you'll find their iconic ""I SEOUL U"" signage.To rent a bike, you come out of the station, go further up front towards the river, and at the main walking path, turn either to the left or to the right and walk about 100M and you'll find their bicycle rental booths. Cycling is the fastest way to cover and see more area but you'll need to return you bike to the same station you rent it from to collect your security deposit of your passport or identity card.Even with walking, you can still enjoy the air, the scene and many photo stops. Convenient stores selling instant noodles, snacks and drinks are nearby."
31,4.0,"I enjoy the serenity in Hanggan river though there are many tourists and locals. What made this exciting is our love for Kdrama knowing that some scenes were shot here. OTher than that, it is just a place to stroll and walk around"
32,4.0,"Inspired by the recent Korean dramas featuring bicycling on the Hangang, my daughter and I decided to try the bike rentals and see the sights on wheels. Managed to download a pretty good guide on Bicycling-Along-the-Hangang from visitseoul and started at Yeouido Park after getting out at Yeoinaru station. The bike station was easily spotted on the right (if you stand facing the river). Have an ID card handy to register for the bikes. Cost is about 3000 won per hour. Bikes are pretty new and have baskets to carry your stuff.The bike paths are well maintained but are not all flat. Some effort required for slopes. Maybe because it was a Sunday, we met with many other ""serious"" cyclists who were polite but kept overtaking us. Only complaint is that the signages were mainly in Korean and we didn't know half the time which bridges we were at. As a result we missed the crossing and didn't make it to Seoul forest. A good place to go across the river to the other side is on the Rainbow bridge. Keep cycling till you come to a traffic light along the path with car access. This bridge also has a water display at certain times of the day.Lots of convenient stores along the way to stop for a drink and snack. There was even a concert with live kpop bands.Scenery is beautiful but weather was a bit hot already in May. Would cycle again in cooler weather on a different route."
33,4.0,"I visit this place at 5pm. So many travellers (i met them from Lithuania and China) and Korean people here (they finished working,came here from the office and relax with their boy/girlfriend here).The view is really..really awesome.the river so clean,the air so fresh,the view is so amazing with long bridge spread from east to west.i dont know what the name of the bridge.there's a ferry tour to discover the river. The park is so clean.there are some cleaning services put the rubbish.There're a words I SEOUL U in the park and ppl can take a pict over there.so i reccomend you this place to visit.come here in the evening and you can see the awesome scenes here."
34,5.0,"This is a lovely river walk and park. Serene, beautiful. Hangang Park is defintiely worth the time to check it out."
35,5.0,it is one of the best place in Seoul to get some air chill out friends. it is usually best to go in summer time as the weather is very hot and you get some cool air and do some water sports too.
36,3.0,went here at night strolling looking at the night lights on the streets and here after dinner so far we love it
37,4.0,"We came here to take the Hangang River cruise. After the cruise, we lingered here for quite a while to enjoy the walk along the river and witness a part of the lives of Seoulites. Hangang Park is a bustling place for young people and citizens to come here for recreational and sports activities. There were many people cycling, picnicking and doing water sports here. It is not too difficult to get here as long as you travel by the subway and will experience something different from shopping and eating in downtown Seoul."
38,5.0,We were here last November 2016 during Autumn and its super cold. This park is beautiful with the icon I S E O U L U. Its quite quiet tho theres few tourist sight seeing around when we were there as its on weekdays. Its located in the middle of Hangang Park .
39,3.0,"we plan to go somewhere else but we accidentally got here because we got out the wrong subway station,  Yeounaru.We had a quick rest on one of the benches while watching some local kids on their bicycles. Nothing much to do here especially with the chilly wind on winterThere was an ""I SEOUL U"" sign which we took the opportunity to take pictures with, while analyzing the subway route and thinking about how to go to other tourist destination."
40,3.0,"Well, it is what it is - a riverside park. There isn't much to do here, except to just take a leisurely stroll along the river and enjoy the wind and the waters for a while, maybe even snap some pictures.There used to be more food outlets here, but they have since closed down and are now replaced by convenience stores. Still, if you do want to get food, you can buy them from the pushcarts selling food like kimbab and tteokbokki, although these are priced a little more expensive.The best time to visit this place is actually in early October, for the Seoul International Fireworks Festival (ÏÑúÏö∏ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ∂àÍΩÉÏ∂ïÏ†ú). But if you are going for the festival, do head down to the park early even though the opening ceremony only commences at 7pm. In fact, you should be there by around 4pm to reserve a nice spot in the park to get a good view of the fireworks. If you don't have a picnic mat, fret not because there will be people selling. Likewise, there will be a lot of pushcarts on that day, so you don't have to worry about food while watching the fireworks either.To get to the park, I recommend taking the Seoul Subway to Yeouinaru Station (Line 5) and going out from exit 4. The park is right in view when you exit the station."
41,2.0,The park isn't very big and relatively quite empty especially in winter. We walked  along Yeouido Park to the cruise terminal and hardly see anyone.
42,5.0,"We came here to see the view of the river and we got more than what we expected. It was a Saturday when we visited the park. There were families camping out and kids were having a great time playing in the park and in the ponds. The water was flowing and it was cool, much like the water from a mountain stream. We joined the crowd and walked through the shallow ponds. As we sat there with our legs dipped in the water, we are mesmerized by the view of happy people out there. It was such a delight seeing a clean public place like this in the middle of the city. Best of all, it's free!"
43,4.0,"When I feel bored after having dinner, sometimes, I drove my car to Banpo Bridge to see waterfall from Banpo Bridge. It's good to see with colorful light and for this reason, it is called Rainbow Fountain.There is a spacious parking lot in the southern part of Banpo Bridge. And another good place is a underneath bridge below Banpo Bridge. This bridge is called ""Jamsu Bridge"" in Korean which means it is overflooded with heavy rain in Summer. You may walk and acrosse Han River just over its surface. It is one of my favorate driving path in Seoul as well.During night, the floating islands called ""Sevit Islands"" are good to drop by. These there places are good to go on foot."
44,5.0,Somewhere my friends and I rode our bikes on our last arvo/night to relax and chill by the river and enjoy a little picnic. There's so many people out and so much to enjoy with a beautiful view of the river and sunset.
45,4.0,"This park is about a 10 minute walk from my house and we enjoy taking our young children down to play at the park in the evenings.  Enjoy the river views and the beautiful sunsets in the evenings.  At night, the city lights up all around the river and this is worth seeing too!"
46,4.0,"Nice park with good views of the city, it is very heavily used, lots of people come here with their picnics, you can even hire picnic blankets.  We came to late to hire a bike unfortunately, it would have been nice to ride up and down the river."
47,5.0,"We rented bikes (about $2.00 an hour) and walked along the river, had a snack and rested under a tree.  A great place to people watch."
48,5.0,"In the early 90's during one of the major storms in Korea, I was in Korea on the Metro crossing the Hangang river and the river had risen very close to the track.  So this is a must on your visit to Seoul, visit the beautiful parks built on both sides of the Han river. Now this is the believe it or not,  and  but from the park, look up to the Metro rail, take a photo, and then make a mental picture of how much water was flowing down the river. Wow. And yes, all the parks built on the river sides were washed away. What I was impressed with is soon after the storm, they were rebuilding the parks again."
49,4.0,"Its a long river that features different attractions depending on where you enter. It has parks (some sports oriented and some water oriented), restaurants, and a boat ride too. You can both visit in the day and night. NIce play to exercise and chill and at night see the lights."
50,5.0,Hangang Park it was nice place for visiting and have good building .we take a lot picture .it natural view.
51,5.0,"Love this park along the Hangang River - it is a clean, green, lovely place to walk and ride a bicycle.  We rented a flat for a week and had the privilege of a view of this park every morning."
52,5.0,You must visit the Han River/Park at least one time on your visit of Seoul.  It serves as a lovely break from the concrete filled jungle that Seoul is and lets you breath a little.  Watch out for the many pedestrians and cyclists thought!
53,4.0,"Really large area - under two bridges so its very unusual! They have two neon buildings for restaurants and a lot of cycling tracks. At 8.50pm. from one of the bridges at the bottom, they would start spraying out water to the sound of stand by me! From the bottom bridge, it looks like a waterfall. Have seen better. However, the park is a nice area for families etc."
54,5.0,"We opted for the 45 minute (roundtrip) ferry ride down the Hangang River. Great views with plenty of photo ops.  We noticed many people renting bikes.  There's also a ""pool-like"" area that locals were using to cool off.  Popular place for locals to hang out on warm days."
55,5.0,"There are several Hangang parks in seoul ( Yeouido Hangang Park, Banpo Hangang Park, Jamsil Hangang Park, Ttukseom Hangang Park etc). Gang means river in Korean and Han is the name of the river. It is nice place to relax your mind. Some people use tents. Also there are lots of outdoor activities. Good place to ride bicycles. On every Sunday Parking is free in some riverside parking lot. Nice place for having a picnic with family and friends."
56,5.0,"I really enjoy walking this park on a Sunday. Although this is not a park in the sense of other city centres parks, it is a nice place on the riverside. It allowed me to glimpse what locals do on their free time."
57,3.0,"It was unforgettable yet fun experience. I went there with my mom and a friend on winter in the end of December. We want to walk around but we didn't eat anything before we leave, so we decided to buy a food at a seven eleven and eat it on a bench. The wind blows so hard and the pigeons try to steal some food from em. So I eat and tried to make the pigeons leave"
58,4.0,"THE GOODWe brought food, a cloth to sit, and had a picnic. It is really wonderful to watch han river and the sun set. After your tiring day you can just relax here and play. They have a comfort room, a cafe, and you can even rent a bicycle. They also have a playground/gym for kids and kids at heart.NEED TO IMPROVEI hope there are street food there."
59,4.0,"What a boon. For those that were here in the late 1990s - before this park existed - it's a transformation and introduction of public space. In particular the ""Nanji"" section on the north west river bank near Mapo and the World Cup Stadium, is well cared for. Cycle tracks are great for old and young alike. It's a huge space along the river."
60,5.0,"My friend explain that in past this is a suicide place, the South Korea government develop this area to give positive passion for the people."
61,5.0,There is parking available as well as public transportation.  We found plenty to do and the atmosphere was great.
62,4.0,"Miles and miles of park extend along the Han river as it rolls through the city.  This where Seoul locals go to relax.  You can go lay out your picnic blanket or even sun tarp, and spend the afternoon sunning yourself, or playing games.  But if the weather is nice you need to be prepared to share your little piece of green grass with the other 13 million residents of Seoul."
63,3.0,"It's quite a walk from the Metro station to this park. The fountain only opens from April to October. If you're visiting this in the winter, you still can sit in the park for picnic but you wont get to enjoy the fountain show at night.At night is somewhat quite road to walk from the Metro station to the park. It's better you bring along a partner with you."
64,2.0,"After struggle with the map to get to the park, we found that there is nothing much happening here apart from the Banpo Bridge Show.The show itself it also a disappointment as there is no 'wow' factor at all.Not worth to come."
65,5.0,"The park is huge and alot of things to do. My family enjoyed riding our rented bikes and strolling afterwards. Well maintained gardens, water parks, bike lanes and fountains can be seen. You can even want to fly your kites here. Restrooms and tents are also offered. You can even delivered your food wherever you are in the park. Some ahjummas are giving flyers of menu and deals of their respective restaurants. However, we get our food in one of the convenient stores in the area.,"
66,5.0,"This was a nice relaxing spot to visit.  Very crowded, but I love people watching so that did not bother me.  We laid on our pad and chilled, hung out, and ate ice cream!"
67,3.0,Nice park however was a little disappointing going in evening for lights and view -- Nice park for romantic evening with spouse
68,5.0,I enjoy walking down that's very long stretch of Beautiful greenery; that is to say it's nice to get out of the city and enjoy being on this path you see many people good reviews and it's a relaxing time
69,5.0,It was the best! The Park was green and awesome! It's perfect for camping. It's a great place for biking. Have fun!!!
70,4.0,We loved biking along the river. Free bikes from the LotteWorld station allowed us to see the river and all the recreation opportunities available there to Seoul residents.
71,5.0,"Relaxing place with friend! Also you can order junk food delivery until over 2am, which was very interesting.Rainbow fountain show was also something! I've never seen that kind artificial one in my life. Anyway good memory, worth to visit!"
72,4.0,"Many have already noted how relaxing it can be to visit, so I think I might mirror their reviews because it really is. There are various parks along the river, and if you are looking for a specific activity (boat rides, rainbow light show~~~ etc.), you should do your research beforehand. Still, the park is beautiful and a great place to see!"
73,5.0,Beautiful place to relax...buy a kite and fly it there or rent some bicycles...roller blades..loads of outdoor fun...mats for ground picnic will be a great suggestion if you want to have picnic by the huge riverside with beautiful view of the bridges and city skyline......
74,5.0,My favourite place in Seoul.  I love the river parks and the cycle paths that span the length of the river on both banks. You can literally cycle all day if you want. Then stop off for a rest or a work out at the many exercise stations along the river. The paths are well maintained and are constantly been extended.
75,3.0,"Hangang Park aims to revitalize the River Banks with parks, fountains, bike trails, nautical parks, etc... Outdoor junkies will find it very enjoyable. Development is greater along a few areas: Yeouido, Banpo, Ichon, Jayangdong... This is indeed a very ambitious project, but it still feels bland at time, empty at others, uninteresting at others (ie. riding a bike underneath an expressway interchange). This is the result of decades of history and urban planning. The Korean War has cut off the Han river from its estuary, reducing traffic on the river in Seoul. The width of the river itself (about 1km) discourages walking by or across the Han. Finally, urbanization turned its back on the Han, with bustling areas near the river facing away from the river (Yeouido Financial District, Apgujeong, Sangam, Ichon)... Most of the buildings near the river are still aging apartment complex (the infamous ""commie blocks""), with commercial areas a bit farther away from the river. However, this is still a step in the right direction. The park can be especially interesting in the Summer Days (when swimming pools are set up), or on special events (such as festivals or fireworks). New developments should help make the area more interesting (such as Saevit Islands) down the road. In any case, try to visit it, be in only for the view of the skyline across the river."
76,2.0,"I must be spoilt because there is nothing ""refreshing"" or ""oasis-like"" to me about the Hangang Park. Sorry Seoulites, this is admittedly a welcome stretch of space for cyclists and pedestrians in a city that prioritises automobilists but it is not a park in the European sense. It is nice to look at the city from the riverside but if you are looking for some relief from the stress of the city I would head to one of the mountains instead. It is quiet noisy due to the 4 lane motorways running either side of it plus the bridge traffic."
77,3.0,we went for a firework cruise. the cruise was fine but there are not enough seats and we have to stand during almost 1 hour trip..sigh!! we are ok but it just that our little daughter were not comfortable
78,4.0,"korean always spend time here with their friends, eat chicken and have beer, chatting each other~ u can see music fountain here at night, but we spend 3 days to wait for the fountain, i dont know why it didn't work. people riding bike here so be careful. whatever, u will enjoy this place~ i went here on June, but it is a little bit cold at night, so bring warm cloth when u walk around the bridge."
79,5.0,"Excellent place to have a picnic with friends and family by rolling out a mat or setting up a tent. If you feel like sweating it out, rent a bike and cycle along the Han River and enjoy the view of the park and skyscrapers of Seoul!"
80,5.0,Han River has great view with nice park. It is especially good for couple activities. And cycling is also recommended.
81,4.0,"It's a big party atmosphere when we visited so this may not be representative. Bought some roasted chicken, oranges etc from the street hawkers and have a picnic with the crowd before the fireworks display. Extremely crowded but I guess it will be mostly empty without the festival. Good for picnic in cool weather."
82,4.0,"Good place where locals hang out and relax. Comfortable park on a nice day, just near the water, great cafe near by. Many people sitting on the grass, friends, lovers, families.People riding bicycles along the path, quiet. Clean."
83,3.0,The grass were patchy not really an ideal place for a picnic but saw many locals setting up picnic there. Nice view though.
84,5.0,"A neat and clean environment with all facilities, one may need as a traveler or any local person love an evening outing with fun, sports,cycling or dining."
85,5.0,Love the bytes and the river cruise! Great places for picnic too!The lawn looks clean and there are bicycles rental.
86,5.0,We spent most of our time walking and riding bikes which we were not able to do back home. The park was clean and people were also friendly.
87,4.0,"I and my family just walk and enjoy during visiting this place,..the walking path, bike path are also very good.taking picture and the river being a background was beautiful.Do not forget to have noodles and enjoy a cup of coffee during relaxing and enjoy the spring.keep walking."
88,5.0,"I can walk in the night, beautiful image there, clean water also the little fountain for some pictures"
89,4.0,"The transformation of Seoul is the most noticeable around Hangang Park. There are bike trails, hiking trails, and picnic area next to the river. There are 10 or 11 bridges on Hangang River connecting Seoul to other cities."
90,5.0,"Went on a Sunny but cool day, with the comforting cool breeze it is a perfect place for you to chill out the whole day, perhaps throw a baseball around with your friend. Lots of locals around and feel free to take a river cruise to see the beautiful scenery of the Han River"
91,4.0,"An awesome place to go when you want to just relax from the busy life of Seoul. Great place for all travelers, whether you go as couples, family, friends, solo, or even business people. Just sit down and relax while watching the water, and maybe order something to eat while you're at it. Take a moment to enjoy the scenery and relax, or maybe go take a walk along the river. It's a safe place for families with younger children to just let them go and run around. But remember to come back after the sun sets too (but it may be a bit crowded as more people come). This place is just amazing at night and has the perfect atmosphere for every occasion. So take a short break from your traveling and just take a seat."

93,5.0,We were lucky to be at Hangang Park when the cherry trees were in bloom. A beautiful spring day with people riding tahndem bicycles and rollerblading.
94,4.0,"The Han river stretches far and really wide at some parts.it is quite picturesque with a number of bridges spanning from one side of seoul to the other part.We went to the hangang park in yeouido..but,when taking the subway,stop at yeuoinaru.read and follow the exit signs for yeouido park.the park is just out by the exit.there is a cart selling drinks,snacks and worms(?) boiling in 2 huge pots.There are actually a number of parks,but,we chose yeouido for it's close proximity to the subway exit.for some parks,you have to walk from the exit to get to the park.It is beautiful..vast and wide..with the cityscape of seoul across ,and, also behind you.we got there around 4pm on a weekday in very early springtime..it was chilly and there were a few groups around.it was peaceful and just amazing.There's a Public toilet accessible by ramp,a small playground, benches, and shops where you can rent bikes from around 6000won to around 10000won per hour.there are kiddie bikes with trainer wheels,junior sized bikes, bikes for adults and tandem bikes. The bike shop is just right beside the mini playground.they will ask you to leave some identification if you want to get a bike.From where we were we counted 6 bridges that we can easily see.I would suggest this stop on your second trip to seoul, or on your first if you are staying long enough to make this stop without hurrying things up.This stop best taken slow and easy."
95,4.0,We went here during winter when they convert the swimming pool to a snow sled area.Good for both kids and adult to enjoy sledding and playing with snow if you dont have time to go to the ski resorts. Walking distance from the train station Ttukseom Resort
96,5.0,"This park is by the banks of the Hangang(Han River).Meticulously clean and safe, most parts of Seoul are low-crime areas, if not zero crime including this park.Even if you walk late at night, you feel safe strolling in the park."
97,5.0,"Beautiful park and nice to walk around, enjoy the nice weather and view.You can rent bicycles too, but we did not do so as we did not have enough time as we took the cruise.We were there last week from Noryangin Market. We took a taxi to Hanggang Park that cost less than KRW5,000. We were there at around 5pm and took the cruise to view 8pm rainbow banpo bridge. Recomend for everyone who visit Seoul.The subway with elevator is just across the road from where the cruise is."
98,3.0,"Come here if you are a biking enthusiast. Fantastic trail for biking. For kid, there is a Bike centre where your child can bike in an enclosure, trying variations of bikes. Tip: Long walk (25mins) from the nearest subway. Much better to go by the route past the shops then highway.  Come only if you have time to spare, otherwise, a kid would prefer Lotte World"
