0,4.0,I thought this was great.  It is filed with interesting and very detailed models of Seoul throughout its history.  It is also free and has great English explanations of almost every item.
1,4.0,"It's free!I visited this Museum when it was China New Year or Lunar New Year for Korean. They have a festival, many food stalls, and some traditional dance show (we can dance together and take pictures with the dancers after their routine finished).If you want to know the history of the Republic of South Korea, visit here."
2,5.0,"We stumbled across this museum and were glad we did!  It's a delightful museum that shows the pride the residents of Seoul have in their city and its history.  On one of the upper floors, there's a huge miniature layout of the city.  You can stand above it or off to the side to see how the city is laid out.  You can select neighborhoods and highlight them, but unfortunately this feature is not available in English.  I can away impressed with what the people of Seoul accomplished in rebuilding their city after the war."
3,4.0,"A great place to learn about history of Korea. The layout of museum is very well organized. However, staff need to be more conversant in English."
4,5.0,Good exhibits about the history of Seoul. It is free unlike museums in Europe and they dont pressure you to make a donation. Worth a visit to understand more about Seoul. Spent about 2 hours here. Well worth the time.
5,4.0,"It was raining hard that day, so we decided to take a museum tour and visited many museums, this was our favorite, due to limited time we only spend about 45 minutes, the collections was very well display, from yesteryear long ago and far away, next time when we come, probably stay for a good half day."
6,5.0,It's not huge museum but it gives an interesting overview of the history of the city and has an interactive massive map of the town. It's free and has a pleasant terrace attached to the coffee shop.
7,4.0,A well laid out history of Seoul with costumes part of the exhibits.An hour would be sufficient to see what is on offer. Worth a visit. Coffee available.
8,4.0,"It has few exhibitions, even modern, you should see it when you have time, admission is free, in my opinion 1h is enough."
9,5.0,It is free so not much risk taken by entering.  And inside is some interesting stuff.  The architecture of the entrance hall applied to me and the exhibitions are somewhat unlike in other museums I have visitied.
10,5.0,"We spent a really long time here. The exhibits were great it was a wonderful way to learn about the history of Seoul and Korea. Most of the labels are in English, Korean, Japanese and I think Mandarin. The pictures of Seoul past and present are really wonderful, same goes for the exhibit on all the different streets. The whole museum is excellent and very well done.  We also purchased a great Korean cookbook from their shop. I highly reccommend this museum."
11,5.0,"I was happily surprised by the National Museum. Although the majority of plaques and monitors didn't offer English - there is a ton to look at and large scale miniatures to gaze over. My favourite section had to be the gigantic miniature of Seoul. You can stand up on platforms and have lights point to different areas using a computer. From there, the computer accesses (what seems to be) Google Street View and you can walk through the area."
12,4.0,"Stopped here to get out of the heat in August, It is like a fast tracked version of the history of seoul, starts in the dynasty days through to the modern era. Worth a visit and it's free. One thing here I liked was the scaled model of seoul, if you want to get your bearings on where everything is in the city and have a map on you, you can stand over the top of a model about the size of 3/4 of a tennis court and work out where everything is. Gives you a quick guide to seoul's history."
13,5.0,"When the museum first opened, a good dozen years ago, I was so disappointed.  It was pretty much a studentsâ€™ hands-on environment.  Finally, after hearing so many positives about the museum under new a curator, my wife and I visited the place once more.  While I had high expectations, the experience for both of us was much better than hoped.  The exhibits were extremely well designed and labeled in both Korean and English.  There was amble and appropriate use of multimedia.  Even the special, temporary exhibit was lavishly done in its presentation.All of this was but one more example that Korean public museums have come a long way during the past decade.  I dare say that many are now world class, and this museum is no exception.  There is a gift shop, a coffee shop, a restaurant, and even a playroom for bored young children.  Even old Korea or Seoul hands walk away learning a good deal.  My Korean wife and I agreed that the next time we have friends visiting from out of town or country, we will recommend them to visit this museum - and most likely we will try to accompany them as we look forward to return visits."
14,4.0,This is a beautiful building and the history of Seoul is well displayed.  Clearly they have little love of the Japanese who treated the country cruelly in times past.  There is a spectacular relief map of Seoul that is about the size of a tennis court and one can stand on glass flooring and select items on interest and the spotlight focusses on the model of that item.  Wonderfully done
15,5.0,I was specifically interested in learning more about life for Koreans during the Japanese colonization and the Korean war to present. Their are multiple floors which separate ancient Korean history all the way to modern Korea today. I only went from 1940 - present and it was well done. There are areas where I think English translation was missing and would have been helpfull although most areas do include English. The audio tour is unnecessary. Best of all the museum is FREE. Great experience and I highly recommend.
16,5.0,Very clean and well maintained museum.  A lot of great displays and artifacts.  A quite enjoyable experience to learn more about Seoul and it is free.
17,4.0,"it was raining really hard when we visited this museum... and fortunately it was a blessing. i had fun knowing the history of korea for free. yes, this museum is free for all."
18,4.0,"The historical exhibits are moving, clearly showing what the residents of Seoul have been through in the past hundred years.  Subjugation, war, deprivation -- they've been through it all and evolved this beautiful, vibrant city.  The historical exhibits here give you a feel for what life was like here over that time.But the highlight is the huge model of the city.  You can walk over it, shine spotlights on different parts of it, project close-up views on a big screen -- and get a really good idea of what is where in Seoul!  Great for helping you plan what else you want to see and where to go to see it."
19,4.0,"The museum is free but it contains a lot of galleries.  It has an replica of a typical run-down restaurant and a model of present-day Seoul.  It had extensive showcase of Seoul's history including a replica of a typical apartment home, complete with furnishing.  It's a great way to spend a couple hours.  We went in September and it was rather hot in the building."
20,5.0,"If you want to learn the history of Seoul (not the entire country) come to this museum. Staff are very friendly. Permanent exhibits are in both Korean and English, while special exhibits are generally only in Korean. We especially liked the ""Tardy Student"" tram/streetcar outside, the Seoul 1988 Olympics, the apartment/traditional city living, and the large scale model of the city (who knew it was SO huge). There's also a lovely cafe for a bite to eat or a coffee.We tried to send photos from the free photo booths but they never arrived in our email boxes. So, if you use them (and they are quite fun) be sure to take a picture with your camera or phone."
21,3.0,"The museum is interesting though probably not for everyone. The grounds around it are marvellous and people use it to get out of their units , for walks and exercise so its very nice and useful and a pleasant outing. but...... a bit bland"
22,5.0,"The whole place is huge, you can easily spend half a day going through. We only stayed 2 hours as we were hungry, but everything we saw was pretty amazing. Our faves were the Neolithic era relics, including the pretty well-preserved skeleton from that age."
23,5.0,"Admission is free and I must say these free entrance is a real good deal! Not a really big museum but you really need a few hours to explore all the areas. There's just too much to learn over there. From the knowledge of the development of the country, to Joseon dynasty history to the miniature city landscape of korea, it's just soo educative and interesting to explore.Unlike museum in Singapore, seoul museum has a very interesting & creative ways to portray their display. That alone is enough to wow you for 1/2 an hour. You can take picture with their system and best part, they will email the photos to you so you'll get to keep a memory of your trip there!"
24,4.0,"This museum is in the heart of Seoul access by the Gwanghwamun subway station and directly opposite a huge 10 storey statue of a hammering man.  The museum is not large.  The miniature scale model of the entire city on the 2nd floor is a very interesting visit.  The guide there was very helpful and highlighted areas of the city and gave an overview of the span of this sprawling city.  Other than this display, the rest is a rather standard display of the history of the development and growth of the city.  The old photographs traced the interesting entry of foreign influence into Seoul. Good restful stop in the city."
