0,5.0,hilarious! Non verbal performance. Exaggerating gestures and comical facial expressions make the show suitable for both young kids and adults. The cast was able to respond quickly to the audience reactions to various parts of the skit. Great work!
1,5.0,"This is my second time to watch NANTA show. I bring my little one with me this time. He enjoyed it so much, and ranked it as his most favorite activity of his holiday in Seoul. Thank you for the great performance by the black team!"
2,5.0,"Great show. Very funny and engaging. My daughter laughed throughout the show. We really loved it, Would watch this again next time we are in Seoul."
3,3.0,"After the opening of the show which began with a slow performance, things got interesting when the cast started cooking. It was hilarious at some parts but the actions were repetitive and the chopping/cooking scenes were not exciting. I would not recommend making a special trip to watch the show."
4,5.0,"First time to attend a performance in a foreign country, not knowing what to expect.  But you don't need to understand Korean in order to appreciate this show.  The actors/actress was very professional, talented, and hilarious. Our family had a good 90-minute laugh and blast!  Highly recommended for anyone who's in for a good humour :)  The crew is to be commended, bravo!"
5,5.0,"Watching for second time, this time together with Brother’s family. Kids love it. Very entertaining."
6,5.0,"This show was so entertaining, in every way! It is funny, has great music and rhythm, lights, and surprises. Everything is mostly nonverbal so any language can understand it. This was my family’s highlight of our trip!"
7,5.0,Absolutely fun and very interactive international show. Small cozy theater which allow the audience to interact well with the performer. The show and performers are legendary themselves.
8,5.0,It is an entertaining show! My husband and mom watched it on our free day in Seoul. We got the black team. Very skilled and talented actors and actresses. No regrets on this :)
9,4.0,Very entertaining for both children & adults! The theatre is not too big so the performance feels up close and personal.
10,4.0,"I am more of a musical guy and not a huge fan of this type of show but I must admit that I - and my whole family, especially the teens kids - truly enjoyed it. Plot is simple and nothing new - exactly what's described in the synopsis, however, the impromptu interactions with the audience brought everyone an element of surprise which was truly funny, enjoyable and entertaining. Ticket pricing is very reasonable. The only trivial thing to nitpick is the venue - DON'T get confused with the ""Myeongdong Theater"" which is a few blocks away. The venue that hosts the NANTA show is actually a building called Unesco building in Myeongdong and the sign to the building is not very clear and it took us a while to locate it."
11,4.0,Whenever I have visitors from overseas I invite them to NANTA show.   I have never seen anyone that didn't enjoy the show regardless the age.   My youngest guest was a boy of 5 and the oldest was a gentleman at the age of 77 and they all loved it.  Especially the younger ones loved it soooo much~ I was told that they keep talking about the show after their return.   Thanks!
12,5.0,An interesting and funny play which my family and myself enjoyed so much... I was invited to stage to interact in one part too.
13,5.0,"The show was very interesting, funny and the actors were great!!!! I definitely will recommend to my friends who go to Seoul next time. I myself will watch again when I am there again."
14,5.0,"Funny funny funny!  Great for all ages, book your tickets at least 2 days before. My kids were enjoying it!"
15,5.0,"So much fun to watch and participate as well. Great for young kids and family, and anyone who just want to relax and have a laugh."
16,5.0,"We went for it with high expectations as we have heard so much about it from friends and also via online sources but the show exceeded our expectations. It was really a nice concoction of non-stop action, fun and  laughter for the whole family, all executed in perfect timing and rhythm. Already recommended it to another friend who gave the same two thumbs up. What a show!"
17,5.0,"the show is fun, hilarious and joyful. Even if you don't understand Korean, you will understand the show. enjoy."
18,4.0,The show itself was absolutely incredible! The only downside was that it was very hard to find the building and so we ended up being late and missing the opening. Because of this we didn't get to sit in the seats that we booked - so definitely give yourself extra time to find it. I would definitely see it again and plan to the next time I go to Korea
19,5.0,The theatre was small and hence it doesn't really matter where you are sitted as you will still get a good view. The entire show comprises of only 5 performers but it was highly entertaining. My two boys were laughing away throughout the whole performance. Definitely recommended!
20,4.0,"Our family enjoyed the show very much. We will return to watch it again, probably at the other theatre at Hongdae. Just wondering if the show at Hongdae Theatre is different from Myeongdong Theatre's?"
21,5.0,"great laughter throughout, definitely worth the dollars..location is great with shopping & restaurants, not a dull moment.."
22,5.0,Great show for all ages. The show has a bit of everything. Highly rated and I’m glad we got a chance to see it here in Korea.
23,5.0,It's really entertaining for family of elderly and children. They're very good in getting audiences to be involved in the performance.
24,5.0,We had a wonderful time sitting close and even getting to participate in the show. They were comical and a joy to watch!
25,5.0,We are an Australian family and I booked this evening performance even though we don’t speak Korean. Reviews said we didn’t need to and they were right. It was a fabulous show with drumming visual humour and martial arts. Quick paced with audience participation. My husband was doubtful but he was soon laughing out loud. What a professional show and great timing. I laughed till I cried. My 15 year old loved it. Highly recommend. There are two theatres to see it. We went to Myeongdong and was easy to find in the market area. Don’t miss it.
26,5.0,"I travel with my sister, my 13-year old, and my 82-year old mom.  With such diverse age group, it’s a bit tricky to find something that could please everyone.  Based on the rave reviews, I took a chance and got 4 VIP tickets. I am so glad I did it as everyone love it.  It’s located on the 4th floor of a business building.  Since I transport my mom in travel wheelchair, I love the elevator and she just needs to climb a few stairs when we got to the theater.  As you could imagine, there are a lot of banging and stuff.  But, there is still a story line without much verbal communication.  I think it’s much better than Blue Man GroupIn US.  If you are still pondering whether or not to see this show, I think you should give it a go. You will enjoy a fun and relaxing evening!"
27,5.0,our whole family from 10 years old to 90 years old enjoyed it very much.  Highly recommend to see the show
28,5.0,"Our 9, 6 and 3 year old kids loved it! We had a break from the busy shopping district of Myeongdong with this very entertaining show!"
29,4.0,Our family enjoyed this relaxing show.  We can't stop laughing while listening to the drum beats.  tt was a fun fun show great for family with children as well.
30,4.0,I visited with my kids and worried if they feel bored and say when it is done but no worries. It is fun from the begining to end. Kids laugh a lot. We clap a lot too.
31,5.0,"Went to a 5pm performance. Bought tickets at the theater (which was hard to find; it’s in the UNESCO building) within an hour of the performance and was able to get great seats in the second row (the first row is designated as a “splash”zone where you can get hit by flying food. Very entertaining show, LOL funny. The White team cast did an excellent job. You don’t need to understand Korean to enjoy it and it appeals to all ages."
32,5.0,Great entertainment and Silent Comedy  Korean style using the Kitchen and Cooking as the main theme. Well worth the ticket price and also the location is very close to our hotel in Myeongdong  and in the middle of all the busy shopping and eateries.
33,5.0,Extremely good and entertaining show. The best I have ever seen. Recommend this show to everyone visiting Seoul.
34,5.0,A must-watch show in Seoul. Highly recommend to those who are planning the trip to Seoul. An easy understanding show even you don't understand any Korean! Enjoy the show and enjoy the laugh!
35,5.0,"Great show, very entertaining and suitable for all ages! Theatre was of a good size and so even though I was sitting on the upper floor I could still see what was going on. Highly recommended!"
36,4.0,My six year old son really love this show. He was laughing so loud people around us start laughing with him.
37,5.0,The show is easy to understand and funny. Recommended to everyone! You won't have a dull moment during the show.
38,5.0,"This is a funny show.  I brought my children to watch (ages 11, 8, 5) and they enjoyed it very much.  It shows the fun side of cooking, chopping vegetables, and preparing for a banquet.  The characters of Cooking Nanta make everything look easy and cool!  After watching the show, my children showed so much eagerness to help in the kitchen and in learning how to cook.  I hope Cooking Nanta continues to inspire people of all ages!"
39,5.0,"Nanta was the perfect evening outing for our family - we have 2 boys - 10 and 13. It's often hard to participate in night life when travelling with the kiddos, but this was great! We were all laughing out loud the whole time."
40,5.0,"great family fun for when you need a break from the shopping or if the weather turns - five star performance, sounds, lights, dancing and comedy"
41,5.0,"Funny, wonderful, creative, very enthusiastic, interacting with the audience, worth seeing, highly recommend !"
42,4.0,We had a fun night watching the show. The actors are all very good and they definitely know how to make the audience laugh.
43,5.0,Amazing show! Thought the kids wouldn’t enjoy but they said it’s their favorite and they laughed out loud! Glad we booked this show!
44,5.0,Went with my husband and two kids (1 yo and 5yo). We hurt our stomachs laughing really hard. My 5yo laughed was happy he could laugh so loudly nobody told him to keep quiet.
45,5.0,"Should be advertised as a family show!  Our grandchildren, ages 8 and 6, loved the show, as did the other kids in the audience!  Especially the afternoon shows!"
46,5.0,"We attended a 5pm performance near Hongik U on a Wednesday. We paid with a discount (kind of confusing to navigate) and it did not look like there were many seats left, but the theater was only half full. I suspect you can get last-minute deals like you can in NYC for theater tickets. That said, it was definitely worth the $70 or so we spent for two seats. It was REALLY FUN!!"
47,5.0,The show was unexpectedly funny. Our 11yo & 15yo children loved it as much as we did and wanted to watch it again. Highly recommend!
48,5.0,My sister recommended to take my 11yo son to watch it in Seoul. we love it and want more. you don't need to understand Korean to enjoy the show....it's awesome show for all ages. highly recommended.
49,5.0,"It’s a very nice evening event. You are  around what of the most active night areas in town. It’s clever and funny. Kids and adults love it. They do acrobatics, there is love and laughs, and lots of things that will make you say wow."
50,5.0,We had a good time watching the show. Some portions are predictable but overall good entertainment value.
51,5.0,First time visit to the show and enjoy the show throughout. Even children enjoy it as no language barrier.
52,5.0,"Seoul was an excellent visit late Fall with few guests and an exceptional time for exploring the city over 1 week.  Photography, exploring, foodie and shopping among so many great experiences.  A great city, extremely safe and beautiful with respectful people of South Korea"
53,5.0,My 13 year old daughter and 80+ year old mother enjoyed the Nanta show.  The theater was very intimate.
54,4.0,The location of the MY Nanta Theater is the best as it is so convenient in the heart of MY. The ambience of the theater is good too. We totally enjoy the show and had a good laugh. Certainly worth the visit.
55,5.0,The show is good. Fun and entertaining. My kids (8 and 3 years old ) love it. Location is good too. In the middle of the shopping areas.
56,5.0,"It was Funny and enjoyable performance, good entertainment and highly recommended to everyone. Wonderful show to watch."
57,5.0,"The most amazing and wonderful experience to my family had on a trip to Korea. We had a good time, laughed and were not bored for a second. Throughout the trip, We imitated for excerpts from the play show. Great players. Excellent  experience. We share the experience with everyone of our friend."
58,5.0,"Everyone in my family enjoyed the show thoroughly, from my 9 y.o. son who couldn’t stop laughing from the beginning to end, to my parents who felt that this was one of the best shows around. It’s very entertaining, funny, and talk about a 4D show!! The cooking smell is such a nice touch!!!"
59,5.0,Great experience... fun show enjoyed by our whole family.  Show ran about 90 minutes.  Professionally executed.
60,5.0,"I went with my family, and we all enjoyed the show very much. It was a good combination of action and comedy, and was very easily understandable. They even had English subtitles (and also a few more languages) for the few screens to explain the plot."
61,5.0,"It worths every penny. The performers are professional, and the story is so fun. All adults and little children enjoy the show very much. Love it."
62,5.0,"The location of the theater was not difficult to find. I went to the Myeong Dong branch. I had bought the tickets online via Klook on the same day and received a speedy email and confirmation of purchase of tickets. Going tot the ticketing counter to received the physical tickets was a smooth experience. Nice clean place in an area with such to eat and shop was a plus point. The theater was a bit smaller than expected but when the lights were turned off, all that didn't matter anymore. The show was very entertaining. The skills and performance and expressions were great and I had a truly enjoyable time. After the theater, I got myself a Nanta kitchen apron and hand mitten for my oven use, all signed by the performers. If you like music, beats and tunes (plus point if you are an avid cook), you love this show."
63,5.0,"Had an awesome afternoon with our 6 and 4 year old who loved the show. It is a very cosy theater. Online it al seemed sold out but they hold tickets to be sold in the theater itself so we could go on the same day and still sit next to each other with the 4 of us. The show is highly funny and the drums work is brilliant. It takes about 1,5 hr and we came out all energized and excited. We wouldn’t have wanted to miss it; a highlight of our Seoul trip. I even got to participate and as a gift received a photo (as no photo/video is allowed by the audience)."
64,4.0,"First off, I am from the United States.  My first thought is that this is a derivative of Stomp, except using kitchen utensils.  That is a little unfair of a comparison, though.  From other reviews, it is true that one doesn't have to understand Korean to enjoy the performance, so that is a big plus.  The performers do a good job of involving audience members as well.  If you enjoy percussion/drumming, you will really like this show."
65,5.0,Super talented cast who are full of humour. Absolutely love this.  Book early for good discounts too. Highly recommended
66,5.0,"Recommended by a friend and not disappointed. Starts off slow but goes off very well in the end. The performances were well scripted and although without much lines, they managed to pull off the storyline with very funny acts."
67,5.0,"My family enjoyed the show very much. Very funny, sometimes very impressive, very energetic and energizing. Strongly recommended!"
68,5.0,"Please purchase your ticket online as it cheaper if buy on site. Must watch show if going to Seoul. After a long day walk, sitting in a theater to enjoy a lively performance is perfect."
69,5.0,"Went to this Nanta show at Myeongdong. Easy to locate, its along the food street.We via internet which is cheaper. A 90mins entertainment suitable for all ages. A must when u r in Seoul"
70,5.0,"The NANTA theater was highly recommended so we went to book tickets online ahead of our trip to secure the seats. The theater is a cozy-sized premise so I do not see much difference in paying for expensive seats vs cheaper seats. The front row seats (ie expensive seats with better view) would be more possible ""targets"" for the performers to come invite you to participate in the show, and sometimes the performers tend to throw food around so the front audience definitely gets showered by vegetables. The show boasts of great choreography perfectly timed to the music. A lot of energy from the performers as they display their knife-skills and some acrobatic activities too. The show does not require much talking, a lot was communicated via pure body action hence language is NOT a barrier at all.  No photos allowed during the show hence I could not share any, but the seating was comfortable enough. No food or drink is allowed inside the theater during the show."
71,5.0,Good show. In fact better than Vegas's Blueman group. Very entertaining and no language barrier at all.
72,5.0,Think blueman show but Korean style and cooking.  You don't need to know the language to enjoy the event and have a good laugh.  Very much worth the price and time to take a day off from under the sun and enjoy an in-door show.
73,4.0,"The whole show had only 5 people on stage. But it was funny with corny humour. It was in the middle of myeongdong, very close to our hotel. We only bought cheap tickets so were seated upstairs - lots of empty seats but everyone was given seats in only 2 rows. During the show they threw things into the crowd and asked for volunteers however this was only for the people on the bottom floor. Nevertheless you can see everything from the top."
74,5.0,It was a rainy evening so we bought tickets at the door with little expectation of what we’ll be watching. We were well entertained from the beginning until the end. So much fun and comedy that had everyone from the young and old laughing through the night
75,5.0,"Seeing NANTA at the Myeong-dong theater was one of my favorite experiences during 2 years of living and traveling around Seoul. Although I don't typically enjoy theater, this show could make anyone laugh! It is silly, sweet, and the music is great! I would recommend this theater and the show NANTA to anyone who is interested in comedy, musical theater, cooking, or Korean pop culture."
76,5.0,"I went with my mum and she enjoyed the show a lot. It's really a great stop after a day of shopping to take a rest and enjoying the show.   It's very entertaining and interesting.  There're interaction between performers and audiences.  It's a great experience and it's my mum's 1st live show.  I would strongly recommend this show to all, including elderly & kids.  They'll sure enjoy it."
77,5.0,"With all the on-demand shows, games and apps onscreen, it’s very hard to impress my children nowadays, let alone keep their attention long. Unless it’s a very good show like this one. My young one still talks about it every now and then, months after we watched it. Truly impressed by mastery of rhythm, comedy and agility by the performers."
78,5.0,"From the start to finish the storyline and the actions never stopped.  It was funny, action packed, and interactive. Hardly any words spoken so you do not need to speak Korean to enjoy the show. Our 9 year old said the next day if we could see the show again! Our 2 teenagers enjoyed the show as well."
79,5.0,Went with hubby and kids and we enjoyed the show. We brought our tickets via Changi Recommend website and had some discount. Do take noted that you need to collect your tickets at least one hour in advance and the ticketing counter opens at 1pm. Location is near N Seoul tower and is within Myeongdong shopping area. The very popular Iassac toast is nearby too.
80,5.0,"The show is thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. I came with the expectation of a play of sounds using tools in the kitchen but it was much more. Do not continue reading if you would rather be surprised like me. The show had a storyline, is funny, entertaining, had some acrobatic moves, dance and also engaged the audience a lot. The 5 actors got the whole family laughing, even the younger ones. Oh, they even included a small magic show. No wonder it's a must see show and I'm glad we did."
81,4.0,Like a Korean version of Blue Man Group centered around cooking. It was interactive and very funny. Knowing Korean was not necessary.
82,4.0,"Do book on line for discount price. They don't accept advance booking at the counter, except for the same day. We bought the 50,000W seating which was in the middle of the theatre. The show starts on time and it was a fun and entertaining two full hours. Started with four characters in chef uniform preparing food in the kitchen, chopping, stirring, ended up juggling, drumming, jumping, somersaulting and dancing in pulsating beats.  It was energy packed, fun to watch and comical at the same time. We had a good laugh at the skit too. Whole show total 5 characters but they are enough to fill up the whole stage with their act.  Highly recommended."
83,5.0,We had a really good time watching Nanta Cooking Show at Myeongdong Nanta Theater. It was easy to locate the theater in Myeongdong. The theater is clean and the service staff was helpful.
84,5.0,"Nanta Theater is very culinary, the lounge has cafe and culinary backdrop to take picture with. For the show.. Each week or day, there is different casts according to colour groups. We attend to watch the red cast performance, which was really fun and exciting. The cast really work hard in the performance and was entertaining at including audience to be part of the performance.It really was creative how they can music using cooking cutlery and with thihgs you can only find in the kitchen. Note: The cafe serves great hot chocolate and there is wifi also"
