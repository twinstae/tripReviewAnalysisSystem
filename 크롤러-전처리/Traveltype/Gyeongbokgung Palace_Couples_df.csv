0,5.0,"First Seoul and Korea were not our visit destination. We visited during a layover at the Incheon Airport. If you ever have a long lay-off and land before 8:00, do this tour. I could not stand the airport for 8 hours. I researched about how this was the principle palace of the last dynasty Joseon to rule Korea in 1395 and how it was rebuilt in the 19th century after 300 of non use. In addtion, this is the site of the Japanese seat of government with its capital building on site that also served as the first seat of government for the Korean Republic. While historically those all are true, the reason to visit is an amazing building that is incredibly painted with a series of gates and buildings that truly speak to the soul of Korea. The setting between mountains and the city is amazing and the juxtaposition of the palace to modern Seoul is stunning. The gates and the palace are the stars but the dining hall on the pond is an incredible building in a beautiful setting. The day we visited though it was cold, as there was ice on the pond. We really only got to see one thing in Korea but I have to believe we saw the best thing with the most historical impact. Go and take the tour."
1,5.0,"Great for those who want to know more about the history and culture, and no you don’t really need a tour guide if you just want to take pretty photos and they had traditional wear for rental as well"
2,4.0,"I’ve read that access to the entire grounds isn’t free.. but that wasn’t the case when we went. Maybe the entire grounds were open for the Lunar New Year?The architecture was magnificent and seeing the old palace with the new urban city in the background was something else!We also stumbled upon the changing of the guard, a very interesting ceremony."
3,4.0,"This isn’t the most beautiful palace in Seoul, but it is impressively large and strolling the grounds is very relaxing.  It’s also in a fun neighbourhood and near several other attractions."
4,5.0,"Make sure you take in the changing of the guard, we did the 1030hrs. Also do not miss visiting the museums, both are well worth it; best to set aside most of the day to do the museums justice."
5,5.0,My husband and I walked here from Insa-Dong area. The Insa-Dong visitors center was very helpful and provided us a map to the palace. This place was very cool. Cost $6 usd which is very reasonable. There were lots of visitors but it wasn’t so crowded that it made the visit unenjoyable. The museum on the premises is very helpful with providing more information about the palace that isn’t explained on the grounds.
6,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace was the first and largest of the royal palaces built during the Joseon Dynasty. Built in 1395, Gyeongbokgung Palace was located at the heart of newly appointed capital of Seoul (then known as Hanyang) and represented the sovereignty of the Joseon Dynasty. Beautiful architecture and they restore the building quiet well after the first palace was invaded by the Japanese back in 1945 - 1948 where Korea was attack, much of the building in the palace was run down and destroyed, they were moved to the second palace in Cheongdeokgung Palace. There were beautiful matching presentation to shows how the army and General March during the dynasty and how they serve the king during Joseon Dynasty. Lovely wonderful place ☺️☺️☺️"
7,4.0,"Such a beauty palace and plenty of nice places to take pictures(especially if you have rented a hanbok)!Protip: it cost 3K won to enter the palace but if you wear a hanbok, you get to enter for free!"
8,4.0,"This is a very large open area. The buildings can only be viewed from the outside. I find it amazing that the colors seem so fresh while being exposed to the weather. It was interesting to see so many tourists dressed in traditional hanbok costumes, especially when they are taking photos of each other. Didn't know that was a ""thing"" until later. The changing of the guard is an interesting ceremony to watch."
9,5.0,"The Palace is definitely worth visiting! To see everything and take photos, you need around 3 hours. We did this around The Changing of the Guards. The changeover is impressive and lasts about 20 minutes. Get into the palace about 140pm for a 2pm changeover, this means you get front row viewing! The clothes they wear are amazing. While there you can see lots of people dressed in traditional hanbok clothing which adds to the experience. You can actually hire the clothes yourself before visiting the Palace."
10,5.0,"The palace with its vast grounds is more than 600 years old and reflects Korean traditional architecture. Don't miss the changing of the guards ceremony at the  Gwanghwamun gate at 10 am and 2 pm. It is quite elaborate and different. You get to pose with the guards for photos,  after the cermony. Entry fee is 3000 won per person. But if you are wearing a hanbok (which you can rent from shops nearby), entry to the palace is free. If you are planning to visit multiple palaces, consider buying an integrated pass for 10,000 won with which you can visit four palaces and the Jongmyo temple."
11,5.0,"Learnt so much about the beautiful country, its traditions, culture and its rich dynasties. Absolute must see"
12,5.0,"This is a good place to visit if you love to watch period Korean dramas and if you love historical buildings. There are many areas you can explore in Gyeong-bok-gung. (Gung means palace in Korean.)The palace is very big so if you want to cover exploring the whole palace, give yourself the whole noon till evening, to visit this place. There are some description of each building and areas to read but not a lot to read. If you want to learn more about each area and building, it would be good to have a guided tour in your own language. The little description placed there are not very detailed and do not explain much about the whole place. I went this palace about three times on three different tours and each time was different. With a tour guide, you would learn why the floor is sand and stone (so that the guards could hear if someone is around to prevent assassination.). Without a guide, the floor would seem like it is just bare from tourists stepping all over.You could enter the Palace for free if you are wearing a Korean traditional costume!You could rent a traditional Korean costume from nearby shops just outside the palace. Try to rent them online in advance and go there early to collect them. The rental packages usually comes in 2 hours, 4 hours,  6hours or one day rental. And they are considered very cheap and affordable to rent! I had a 4 hour rental with additional 2 free hour package for only 24 SGD. And because the shop was very near, I changed into the costume and entered the Palace in just a 5 minutes walk. And after visiting the palace and taking photos in the costume, we went back to the shop to return it and changed back. The whole process was very convenient."
13,5.0,Very beautiful place. When in traditional dress for free otherwise entrance 6 EUR. Good places for pictures.
14,5.0,"Around Gyeongbokgung, there’s a lot of Korean national costume rental shops . For you to create your own imagination how you look like when you are in Joseon Dynasty. Lots of fun with taking many pictures with your friends. ❤️❤️"
15,5.0,"The breathtaking views and amazingly well kept palaces and grounds made it seem like I was back in ancient times. You can spend an entire day sitting in front of the clear lake watching the large golden fish swim by as you drink your coffee, or walk the paths along the green lush background as you enter different parts of the palace. A great way to thoroughly enjoy this palace is to emerge yourself into the culture! If you rent a traditional Hanbok (tradition korean dress) admission into the palace is free. I’m sure the rental of the outfit is more than the palace admission but let’s face it, we travel for the experience! A definite must see!"
16,5.0,"For me a must visit when in Seoul. You need to wear comfortable shoes in exploring the place as it is big area. When a visitor is wearing the Korean traditional costume “Hanbok”, there’s no need to pay for entrance. One can rent for the costumes in many different rental stalls nearby."
17,5.0,"It was very interesting to visit Palace, on the enter they offer me to dress up like ancient warrior, we also visited museum."
18,5.0,Local feels Beautiful structures Beautiful hanboks you see everywhere Turn back the time in ancient Korea
19,4.0,It’s an impressive place so I recommend at least walking through it. It’s 3000 per person so go there if you are doing the gardens at Changdeokgung palace or are walking in Bukchon Hanok Village. It is a nice place but I found it a bit weird that tourists were wearing traditional dresses while walking around the palace.
20,4.0,"Great preservation of the grand palace. We were so lucky also to witness the changing of the guards, apart from taking selfies with so willing pretty korean ladies in hanbok costume!"
21,4.0,"Still my favorite palace to visit Seoul after having done Changdeokgung, changyeunggung & deoksokgung.Dont forget to also watch the guard-changing ceremony, Royal palace museum & national folk museum (including the outdoor exhibits), which are ""outside"" the palace perimeter but just outside the gates. And free to visit."
22,5.0,"It’s really easy to find the Palace, there are signs from the subway station all the way to the place. We went during Chuseok, a national holiday, so entry was free. It’s a really huge palace with plenty to see. Make sure to bring your selfie stick or camera, there are so many gorgeous views, buildings and gardens so you’ll definitely get some fantastic pictures. It’s also beautiful to see people dressed in traditional Korean hanbok. As mentioned, we were there on a holiday but I think you can usually rent a hanbok for some photos.It started to rain a little bit the day we went, but it was still really pretty."
23,5.0,"The tour of the Palace took us 4 hours! Unless you're running through it, you cannot do it faster (OK maybe 3-3,5h is possible too). We went there for the 11 o'clock gate guard change (a shorter ceremony) and finished it with the 2 p.m. General guard change ceremony. Both are for free and can be enjoyed even if you don't go to see the Palace. The entrance fee is ridiculously low, so you will definitely get more than you're paying for. We also got the audio guide as it provides detailed information about different buildings and the history. It's available in English, Korean and Chinese. It's not a must as you can read the signs to get some information but we felt like having an audio guide is easier as you can listen it while exploring. What we absolutely loved and recommend is the hidden café- Saenggwabang, the Dessert Department! It's located in the Palace kitchen buildings, so you need to look for it as otherwise you will probably not just stumble on it. We went there around joon, which is the perfect timing as later most of cakes were already sold out. You can purchase the traditional cakes as well as herbal tea and enjoy it in their lovely little café, on the floor. We absolutely loved the experience! I believe we paid like 9000won,which is ~7€, for a pot of tea and 4 cakes. We really wanted to buy some to go but that's unfortunately not possible, which is actually understandable as they want to keep it a unique experience."
24,5.0,"Really enjoyed our time here, especially the palace garden where the glass house is (not the Secret Garden, we didn't have time for that one). It is so peaceful and interesting, and not full of crowds. Take a picnic with you and make the most of the lovely gardens and quietudr. If you are seniors, do take ID as entry is free for over 65."
25,3.0,"The entire complex is vast. Definitely worth a visit. If you have interest for the history then we highly recommend a tour. Because of the scale of the site it’s easy to miss some interesting parts. They did not provide a map where you purchase the entrance tickets, it would be useful, we asked and the shoed us along. It’s a popular attraction especially on Sunday. 3000 Korean won per person. Allocate at least one hour for this attraction. The washrooms are large and very clean."
26,4.0,"My wife and I went to check this spot out and it was great.There is a subway station attached to the place so it's super easy to get there.The museum is free and quite interesting, some cool old restored royal cars and other stuff.The palace is impressive and well maintained. Tons of photo opportunities, if you are in to that. Recommend renting the costumes, it's fun and they let you in for free if you wear it."
27,5.0,We have visited several palaces in Korea and this is the best so far. Two unique features include a little library and lake where the royalty had events.
28,4.0,"We hired traditional hanbok dress so we’re allowed in to the palace for free. The grounds are huge and the decoration is amazing. The one thing to note is that whenever you go, there is very little shade so if it’s a hot day, make sure you have water. There is a small shop in the grounds, but as a result is very busy. Overall the palace and its surroundings are really interesting and worth a visit."
29,5.0,Especially worth to see a ceremony. Great to see everyone with the traditional costume and if you dare to rent one your entry is FREE!Have tea at the tea house when available
30,3.0,We went there thinking this is a real historic palace to only learn from the tour guide that it was rebuilt after WWII (the Japanese had demolished the original palace and built a modern government building on the same site!)
31,5.0,"A visit to Gyeongbokgung should be on everyone’s list when visiting Seoul. It was the main palace for the Joseon Dynasty, the last dynasty before the Japanese colonization in 1910. It is significant historically, but also worth visiting because of its beauty. Be sure to rent some traditional clothing before going in to get some unique pictures that will be truly memorable!"
32,4.0,"Very nice place, great to come over the weekend and see the local Koreans dressed on their traditional clothing"
33,4.0,"This Palace has some beautiful architecture & bugger structures than Seoul other palaces, but this makes it a lot busier. The buildings are set in a classic structure - as you pass through the biggest & most regal first, then lots of structures of lesser quality follow after with buildings & Court yards to either side.This Palace is easy to wander on your own without a guide.The route follows through to the National Folk Museum & also the is the National Museum of Korea at the side."
34,5.0,A wonderful slice of history brought to life. Probably most easily navigated for tourists as part of a city tour. Note that there's free entrance to the palace for people in tradition Hanbok dress.
35,4.0,We came here on a cloudy day and didn’t choose to go deep into the palace compounds by paying an entrance fee. Tourists were soaking in the atmosphere with their rented hanboks.
36,5.0,We recommend to visit this magnificent palace during weekends so that you can engage a volunteer tour guide to show you  around the palace and giving you more insights into the Korean dynasty era. A nice place for history lovers!
37,3.0,"This Palace also houses the Korean National Palace Museum and the   National Folk Museum.Because it was the biggest remaining Korean palace , the whole complex was systematically destroyed during the Japanese Occupation at the beginning of the 20th Century, and is slowly being rebuilt , including demolition of former Japanese government buildings to recreate the majestic Palace gateways! So everything you see today is very recent."
38,4.0,"It was an interesting place. The palace is a large area with different buildings and gardens. By the entrance gate it was very crowded but the more you walk inside, the less people there is. Alot of people are dressed in the traditional clothes, so it was very interesting. It felt like a movie set or a scene from the past. The buildings were simple with colored wood decorations."
39,5.0,The palace grounds are very big and although there are lots of ppl around you can find a spot to take pics.
40,5.0,"We were fortunate that the palace was free to enter on the day we went, however, even if you have to pay, it's the best palace in the city.It's also charming to see locals, especially youngsters dressing in national costume to get the best pictures for their Instagram account.There are a couple of cafes in the grounds and also at the museum towards the back if you need a break."
41,5.0,They provide a guide and transportation.  Very enjoyable tour.  Guide spoke excellent English and ver knowledgeable.
42,5.0,A really great day out with English speaking tours! There was so much to see and learn about and we were lucky enough to visit whilst a guard ceremony was taking place.
43,4.0,"Easily accessible in Seoul, gorgeous Palace, cheap to get in, look for traditional events on evening."
44,5.0,It was a bit rainy when we came but don't let that put you off if you're prepared. There's a lot of buildings to walk around and see. There's also a Cafe and gift shop if you want to stop and rest a bit
45,5.0,"Must see in Seoul. Picturesque architecture, interesting history, It's worth seeing a change of guard. I recommend to come early, right after opening - this way you can avoid long queues that appear later."
46,4.0,Loved visiting this palace and it’s extensive grounds! Would be lovely to visit when weather is a little cooler as it is all outdoors. So historic and loved seeing people dressed in traditional clothing (hanbok).
47,3.0,"A national treasure, but if you only visit one palace in Seoul, choose Changdeokgung Palace instead (I've left a review there, too).  Gyeongokgung is gigantic, but in its current state feels empty.  Actually, the museums inside were more interesting than the grounds themselves."
48,4.0,"Renting hanbok costumes - traditional Korean dress - gives one free entry.Otherwise, the price is a most reasonable KRW3000 per person.\We visited on a weekday.  It rained for 15 minutes but thankfully stopped.\The grounds are extensive and changing of the guard beautifully done.  One can pose beside these individuals."
49,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung palace was an amazing experience!!! To be submerged in korea's rich history and its tradition, i got to see alot of colorful hanboks(traditional korean clothing) and the amazing architecture surrounding the palace, the palace is huge, with alot of greeny and seats available for it's visitors, there are also bathroom facilities around the palace, although refrain from smoking! The palace also holds a Musuem, and in it a café and some gifts shops,you can also find an area of a very old 80's-town almost as if it got frozen in time, there are so many Hotspots to take selfies and photos so sometimes it can be over crowded but nonetheless the scenery is absolutely beautiful and to be in the presence of the palace was magical!!!! I felt i was reliving history"
50,5.0,We joined one of the free English tour and the guide did a great job at summarizing the main points and explaining historical facts for people without knowledge of Korea history. The Palace itself is beautiful and the crowds of people/tourists dress in hanbok (traditional costumes) give it an additional charm.
51,3.0,Good place to walk around. Interesting to see everyone in national dress.  (Not sure about the foreigners doing it as well though). Can be crowded.
52,5.0,"During our stay in Seoul we went to visit this palace twice.  The changing of the guards is wonderful with the instruments, precision and clothes.  We enjoyed learning about the history of the kings of South Korea."
53,4.0,"We went on a Thursday morning in May and it was not too crowded.  This is the largest of the Seoul palaces and there is much to see in this restored palace compound.  The changing of the guard ceremony is in the area where the tickets are sold and happens at 10:00 and 2:00.  It is quite colorful and is more than just a changing of the guard.  Inside the grounds is the National Folk Museum and it is included with the palace admission.  It also is a large space and we only got half way through.  One could really spend a lot of time in this palace area.  For us, a half day was enough but it was quite nice."
54,5.0,"It is a great place to visit to connect with nature, it is safe and quiet, good option to get away from the noise of the city. Visit it comfortably birng water and camera. Good spots for photos."
55,4.0,"We went to the palace during a long layover in Korea. I was initially hesitant as I was hoping for some shopping instead but ultimately I really enjoyed the visit. For US tourist, I would not even think of going here without a local guide. We saw many tourist trying to listen to our guide as they had no idea what they were looking at. Worth the trip . . ."
56,5.0,"During the Korean Civil War (1950-53), Hanseong (Seoul today)  was changed hands four times and everything in the City was destroyed by Air Raids and  Bombs including the Palace of Chosun Dynasty..  The Main Gate of the Gyeongbokgung Palace was also totally destroyed. Now, the main gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace was rebuilt according to historic look and an tourist attraction event was performed at the Square behind and before the Palace.  It is the Gate Guard Rotation Ceremony Show. Everyday, except closed day, has two sections. Morning section at 10 am and afternoon section at 2 pm.  No admission fee necessary.  Be reminded that you shud come before commenced otherwise you can not enter the Gate during the show.  For preview, you can check the >30 seconds videos at map sites of  Gyeongbokgung Palace Korea and Gwanghwamun  or 12 minutes video at my tube.One very generous move here is free admission to the Palace for all elders of 65 and above, including foreighners."
57,5.0,"This is a beautiful palace on large grounds, housing other temples and museums.  One of the central spots to visit.  Korean youth often visit in traditional costumes.  You will want to plan most of the day to visit here and its associated attractions."
58,5.0,"This is the largest and most spectacular of the ""Five Grand Palaces"", and we consider it a must stop in Seoul.  If at all possible, visit this site when you can experience the Changing of the Guard (morning).  This is a magnificent event--you will take more photos than you ever imagined.  This was part of our tour, and it paid dividends to have a guide."
59,4.0,"If you want to see a Korean templethings, this would be Your place to visit. At the time of our visit, there was things under maintenance, but it did not bother too much."
60,5.0,Main tourist attraction in  Seoul South Korea.Palaces  history is so interesting and beautiful  stroll around. Lots of  historical sites. Must visit  if in Seoul. Love the  tourists in their  traditional dress.
61,5.0,"Of the Joseon Dynasty in Seoul, this is by far our favorite -- though the signnage is less than ideal. Some of the buildings were undergoing renovation and there was no mention until one arrived at the purported location and all that was visible was a wall. But the grounds extensive -- and there are a variety of buildings. If one is only going to a single palace, I would suggest this is the one to visit."
62,5.0,Beautiful old Palace with both striking buildings as well as gardens and ponds. Try to see changing of the guard (several times daily). There is a free English tour of about 60 minutes which is very worth while.  Entrance also includes Folk Museum with lovely exhibits of daily life of the period.
63,5.0,"Rather impressive and you can wander for ages. Would be a great place to let the kids run. Be warned, not much in washroom facilities. Could be improved be have period enactors."
64,5.0,You cannot come to Seoul and not visit here. A must see. Gives you a great history of Seoul and you get to see how Royalty lived centuries ago.
65,4.0,We visited this palace. This is by far the biggest palace so be prepared to walk a reasonable distance to cover most of the area. A lot of the buildings are very similar in style and it is interesting from a historical view. There was a changing of the guard which was colorful. Take a bottle of water as there are only a couple of places in the palace compound to get drinks. Worth the visit.
66,4.0,This was built 6 centuries ago and is a really impressive palace in the centre of Seoul. The place is huge and can get quite sunny with little shade so don’t forget suncream and water. There are guards at the gate to look at and pose for photos with. We joined a free guided tour in English which started at 1:30 (they have some more but unsure on the times). This was really useful to tell us about each palace building and point out things you may have missed otherwise. It was hard to believe this is right in the middle of the city! Huge open space with big lavish palace buildings.
67,5.0,"If u wear a hanbok to this place, your entrance fee is waived. Yes, I know the hanbok rental cost more than the entrance fee lol, but it’s the experience that counts. Overall a very beautiful place though some of the renovations were quite obviously of recent make. But it doesn’t detract from the beauty of the place."
68,5.0,Feel the pulse of the bustling capital of South Korea. This picturesque palace is the first royal palace built in 1395 during the time of the Joseon dynasty.
69,5.0,"We visited on Memorial Day. So everybody were out in their traditional hanboks, plus the Honour Guard really complemented the traditional pageantry.A must visit when in Seoul.Korean traditional architecture at it’s best, set in beautiful, extensive gardens."
70,4.0,"only issue was that wehn we there, they were preparing for some sort of conference, so missed the photo with the reflection!"
71,4.0,This palace was very large & a bit hard to finish the tour but it's very good. The palace was informative & interesting stories about the culture & history of Korean!
72,4.0,"Worth the visit, easily accessible from train station.Could spend the day here and nearby villages."
73,5.0,Beautiful ancestral place.Having a tour guide to fill you in about all the history is great. Would recommend this to anyone visiting the area.
74,4.0,"We arrived at about 10am and found out that there is a free english tour at 11am. So, after walking around a bit, enjoying the view, we waited for the tour.  There was about 30pax waiting for the tour to start. A lady dressed in a lovely hanbok gave us a tour. We enjoyed the tour a lot because the information provided about the palace were very interesting. You will appreciate the palace structure, architecture and culture better.   The walking tour took 1 hr and after that, we were free to roam around the palace.  Very enjoyable tour, highly recommended!"
75,5.0,A massive complex which was a great experience. Surrounded by lovely grounds and the wonderful guards display. The guards seemed to change on the hour.
76,5.0,The best way to see this place is to rent a korean costume !!You will be able to take great pictures!!
77,5.0,"We visited the place around 1:45 pm just before the changing of the guard at 2pm. This is amazing old meets new experience. There are many ladies dressed up in their Hanbok and they make the place come alive. The entry to the place is free. It’s great for children, couples and single travellers. It’s a total must see on your visit to Seoul. Wear comfortable shoes, be prepared to walk on uneven ground, and make sure you are there before the changing of the guards at 2pm. If you want a total Korean experience you can rent a hanbok and look like a total tourist! It’s a fun experience and I recommend it!"
78,5.0,Timing here is critical if you want to see the changing of the guard. Our tour guide (VIP Travel - Susan) got us there at 9:50 a.m.  It’s not as crowded in the morning and you will get a good standing spot for the ceremony. Our tour guide (we arranged a private tour thru our concierge with a car which is really worth every single Won!) showed us how they invented a heating system for their buildings to have heated floors!  Pretty smart. Don’t miss the pretty garden in the back and the reason for it. You need an hour plus here to get in the ceremony and viewing the buildings. Hope this makes your visit easier!
79,5.0,A very historic place worth the visit to learn about Korean culture and history. It is one of the must see sites in Korea
80,5.0,We visited the palaces at the end of February. It was a freezing cold day and we got to the palaces very early so that we could get in before they got too crowded with school groups and other tourists. We wanted to get the palace pass for 10000 won which would allow you to visit 5 palaces and shrines in the Seoul but unfortunately we found out that the other main palace - Changdeokgung with the secret garden - is closed on Mondays so we just decided to purchase the single palace pass. It was a lovely day with some incredible architecture and history we read from the English provided guide book. We also managed to watch the changing of the guard at around 10am which was a cool experience. There is a narrator who explains the whole ceremony in English so that was a plus. We spend most of the morning walking around the palace and also made a quick stop in the Korean folk museum which is just alongside the palace. Would definitely recommend doing both palaces if you can and coming during a warmer month where all the grass and tress have bloomed as it is much prettier during this time.
81,5.0,It was a worthwhile site to visit enhanced by seeing the interesting changing of the guard ceremony and being entertained by the large numbers of visitors in rented costumes
82,4.0,"We visited the palace at 5pm on a Monday. It was very busy but large enough to escape the crowds in the trails walking around the gardens. What wasn't great was from 5:30pm onwards, every 5 minutes, a loud voice over a speak system would usher us to the leave the palace asap as it was closing. This was the opposite of peaceful and made us feel like we were in some kind of theme park. I understand why this is necessary with 1,000s of visitors each day but if you're looking for a nice peaceful experience, I suggest you leave enough time to escape before 30 minutes before closing."
83,5.0,The palace is really huge and you can rent a hanbok from just outside the palace side street at a very affordable rate. Beautiful place for pictures and more pictures! Be sure to catch the changing guard changing shift!
84,5.0,A must go if you are a big fan of ancient Korean history. It is like the Korean version of Forbidden City. You can see many people out there dressed in traditional korean clothings.
85,4.0,"We visited on a Monday when the quieter but by all accounts more authentic palaces were closed. Gyeongbokgung is definitely a must see when in Seoul but be prepared for there to be a lot of people, especially if it is a Monday and the alternatives are fewer. Allow around two hours to make the most of it and explore north of the main compound where the crowds become thinner."
86,2.0,"I am sure this is not the grandest or most glamorous in South Korea. I was quite disappointed as this is said to be a must when in Seoul.Once you passed through the main gate, everything seems the same in every courtyard after each gate. The central building is also quite small, perhaps the dynasty was not a big one.We paid to go in as we were not wearing their transitional costumes, it was good that the fee was not expensive."
87,5.0,"I decided to go by the day tour, you might miss the best part of this castle. I visit two times; one time with the day tour and the other time by myself. In day tour, the guide will give you an explanation about the place, the history of the castle, and such. But then again,you have Google and every part of the castle have a short yet detailed explanation about it. Without the day tour, we can go into more places that much more interesting for an international tourist like me. Places that day tour didn't show us, and walk slower, take more pictures.Watch the time, if I'm not mistaken at 12.00 KST, they have a guard changing ceremony (show). Watch it, definitely worth of your time."
88,4.0,Very large area to walk around & pretty much the same in each area.. bit hard to condense the tour here I guess but wished we could..
89,3.0,"Lovely palace grounds. But they could benefit from more exhibits. The area appears big, but could be completed within a 30min walkthrough."
90,5.0,Excellent place to visit for the history of KoreaFree to enter the museum 3 floors of exhibits Easy to get to via subway
91,5.0,"Second visit to this beautiful palace. The scenery is much prettier with the cherry blossom. Even though the place was crowded during cherry blossom, we able to take some beautiful photos. The entrance fee is free of charge when you are wearing hanbok, which the entrance fee is 3,000 won per person. Estimate spending time at this palace for at least 2 hours, because the area is huge."
92,4.0,"We bought a combination ticket that allowed us to visit 4 palaces (Gyeongbokong, Deoksusong, Changdeokgung & Changgyeonggung), secret garden (is within Changdeokgung palace) and Jongmyo Shrine. It saved us $4000 won for visiting these places. Great values. We joined the free guided tour which took about 1.5 hours. We were fortunate to have a good English speaker tour guide. Very interesting to know the history and the purpose of each building. She also explained the building architecture, heating system used in the old days. The weather was very cold that day and raining but we still wanted to finish the tour.  I definitely will recommend you to join the free tour. If not it will be meaningless just to go thru each building and you might miss something interesting. To us, is a MUST. Next to Gyeongbokong palace there is a National Palace museum. It’s free. Nice museum."
93,4.0,Did not manage to enter the palace as it was closed to public on the day we visited.  Still we got to walk around the perimeter of the palace.  Lovely and beautifully crafted traditional korean architechural wooden buildings..so rich in history. What a lovely sight to see and immense in the korean culture..in this case...in their buildings such as the palace.  Surrounded by charming cherry blossoms and the cool weather which makes the walk around the place even more attractive.  Though it was packed with visitors..the place looks spacious and serene.  Definitely a great place to relax and take beautiful pictures with a landscape so amazing to look at.
94,4.0,A very interesting experience. Good value for money and very easy to get to. Beautiful buildings and really well kept grounds.
95,4.0,"If you love museums, as we do, this is the place to go.  The main event is the palace grounds.  Though reconstructed, it give you an idea of royal life.  Second, on the grounds (but I don't think you have to enter the palace to get there) is the National Palace Museum, which tells more of the story about what went on in the palace. Third, and my favorite, is the National Folk Museum, also free and outside the palace itself.  This is where you learn how regular people lived - clothing, making kimchi, village life, etc.  Finally, tucked away in a small building on the north perimeter is a library of material about the palace and the Josean Dynasty.  All the signage throughout all the museums are in English."
96,4.0,Very nice palace with an interesting museum describing the life of Korean people through different times. You can spend 2 hours to visit the palace and the museum. The change of the guards is a must see. The tip from our guide is to wait outside to see the guards practicing before the official change inside the palace.
97,5.0,"We arrived here in time for the 11am English speaking guided tour of the palace and its grounds. Super impressive!! The tour goes for about an hour and covers a lot of the history of the sight and the buildings along with their uses. Our guide spoke good English, so you’ll have no trouble learning something from the tour. In addition to the tour, you’re free to walk the grounds for as long as you want, something totally worth doing!"
98,5.0,I liked the preservation of their history and culture. I liked seeing locals and foreigners dressing up in their rented or purchased Hanbok . Inexpensive $5+ USD for two adults.
99,5.0,"Just came back from an amazing trip to South Korea and one of the most impressive experiences was visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace.  We received a discounted Senior entrance fee which can obtain by showing your passport.The palace itself is massive and even though there were large crowds, we never felt crushed due to the expanse of this palace.  Perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of the visit, however, was experiencing the throngs of Korean people who dressed up in the traditional Honok attire.  It was simply gorgeous and the pride in which the individuals wore there garb was evident.  It truly takes you back in time when you see people in traditional dress and being on those grounds made it even more special.  A changing of the guard occurs every hour and that is fun to watch as well.  When you finish that, make sure to walk the grounds entirely until you get to the National Folk Museum which is also on these grounds."
100,4.0,Try to go early in the day if you want to avoid the crowds. Explore the area in and around the Palace.
101,4.0,"You must visit ALL the local palaces, they are very inexpensive (1,000 won) and you get to see some cool history. I especially loved seeing all the people in authentic dress, by the way you can rent an outfit and you get free entry to any palace."
102,5.0,"We visited on a warm, clear day in April and the palace was like something our of a fairy tale with everything blooming and all of the people dressed in hanboks."
103,5.0,"Entrance fees is 3000 won per adult. Can easily spend one and a half hour walking around the palace. As it was drizzling, the imperial guards change process was cancelled. This palace is linked to the National Folk Museum of Korea. A must go in Seoul."
104,5.0,"We were fortunate to visit here while the guards were being changed and the ceremony exceeds any other such ceremony that one typically can witness.  Much grander of a scale, much more pageantry.  But even if you don't get to see that take place, the Palace grounds and buildings are impressive enough to warrant a visit here for sure."
105,4.0,"Vast complex, can be combined with other sights, such as folk museum and Bukchon Hanok village. Transport back to city on the Hanok side."
106,4.0,"Great palace to see, clean and interesting. Great place to take photos & learn about Korean history! Must visit in Seoul. Only $3,000 Won per person"
107,3.0,The old architecture in the backdrop of a modern city is lovely to see. While I enjoyed I went and saw it I wouldn’t go again . It’s peaceful place to hang out and look around for an hour or so that was good enough for me.
108,5.0,This palace is a great Korean historic site and a place that every tourist should visit. It is also the main palace in Seoul.
109,4.0,"As per title, go for it - it’s free.The female guide was good and shares the history behind the Palace."
110,5.0,We where lucky to see special ceremony what happened only once a year. The place offers a free walking tours or for few dollars you can rent the audio headset. The place was absolutely beautiful. The cherry blossoms are just starting to bloom.
111,5.0,"The palace is nice. There is an entrance fee and they have translators there so you can speak with someone who knows English. But if you rent a hanbok just outside pf the gate there is a shop and they accept credit cards, entrance is free. Rental of hanbok is 7000won for 2 hours."
112,3.0,"The switching of the guards is cool. The palace is large, lots of walking and little to see. We aren’t allowed to enter the the rooms but can see through the windows. Overall, I don’t care for it much."
113,5.0,"It only costs you around $3 per entry, however if you are 65 or older the entry is free. It is also free if you dress up in national costume. The changing of the guards is great to watch. It is twice a day at 10:00am and 2:00pm."
114,5.0,"This palace epitomizes how the old and new blend together in modern Seoul: a sprawling centuries-old palace that is located nearby today's government complexes. The palace is a must-see at least once while in Seoul. A big plus is that it is free entry for everyone into the Gwanghwamun Gate, to witness the daily Guard Changing Ceremony (10am and 2pm daily except Tuesday), and even to enter the National Palace Museum of Korea where there are so many historical exhibits to see. You will be amazed how vast and rich Korea's history is! We did not enter the main palace grounds itself based on our time limit. It would require a nominal entrance fee which you can purchase on the spot. However, wear a traditional Korean Hanbok costume and you can enter for free! There are plenty of rentals within a short walking distance of the palace."
115,5.0,"Just go. You won’t regret it. Even though it is in Seoul, I don’t feel as though I am in a metropolitan city at all, was like stepping back in time. Gorgeous with so much architecture and history to appreciate. Lots of other awesome things nearby to see and do such as The Blue House (White House equivalent). Dress comfortably, one can easily spend a while exploring. You can rent traditional Korean clothing (Hanbok)  to wear when you visit from one of the nearby shops. See if you can catch the changing of the guard ceremony."
116,5.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is extremely huge, similar to some of the palaces in China. There are many places inside the palace to take amazing photos. There are small signs around the palace with brief descriptions of the buildings in the palace, however, the descriptions are not very detailed and if you are truly interested in learning more about the Gyeongbokgung Palace, you should probably follow the guided-tours.There’s also a guard changing ceremony daily at 1000 and 1400 hours. The guard changing ceremony was pretty amazing, but be sure to arrive at the central area of the palace early to get a clear view of it."
117,4.0,"we joined the translated guided tour,and it was definitely worth it! a free locker service is also available, very convenient !"
118,5.0,"Great experience, has rented Hanbok and enter the temple for free. Antique building with beautiful scenery created an amazing place for photography. A must go place when you visited Seoul and you will not regret after you have visit this place."
119,4.0,"Beautiful place - unfortunately, they all take a selfie. on the one hand we see a lot of skyscrapers and on the other this humble side of Korea! the entrance cost $ 3 but the memories remain for a long time! we saw many traditional Korean dresses! It's worth seeing"
120,4.0,"You can enter this palace if you are wearing a hanbok.Instead of entering via the main gate, we used the east gate coming from Bukchon Hanok Village."
121,4.0,"This was part of our private tour and very interesting. It was a lot of walking, as it is a big area and we have mobility issues, but it was worth it. Our guide did a very good job of explaining the various buildings that comprised the palace."
122,5.0,The colourful event happens daily at 2pm where visitors experience live performances of changing of the city centred famous palace guards. Visitors are allowed to take pictures with the guards on duty just like the London’s Buckingham palace mannequin looking soldiers.  Young Korean ladies would be seen wearing their cultural Hanbok dresses when visiting the palace area. It was a nice 12C bright sunny day during the Seoul city outing.
123,2.0,"We came to Seoul in Feb and were really looking forward to seeing this place. I was very glad that it only cost around 3000W/person otherwise I would just ask for my money back. Everything is fake. The different areas are rebuilt and are just new and reconstruction. You cant really get to the chambers. You will get more history and artifacts if you go to the Palace museum to the right of the main entrance and its FREE! The guard change is just laughable - the fakeness of it! The fake beards, the fake weapons... I guess it goes with the whole place."
124,5.0,The place has plenty of water surrounding the old unique Korean architectural buildings and thus offer great venue for photo taking.One interesting thing we observed was that some people were happy to hire traditional Korean costumes and move around the place and snapping photos in them! They did add a nice touch to the ancient surroudings!
125,5.0,"It was snowing when we were there in winter feb , gosh this place is SO GORGEOUS! Stunning, when the floors are covered in snow. Beautiful!"
126,5.0,It's one of the most beautiful places in the Kyubgbokgung Palace. Used to be the place for receiving foreign guest and have banquet here.
127,5.0,"Our initial plan was to wear a traditional clothes called Hanbuk at this palace while we walk around. Unfortunately, we went during winter time and I am not one to stand up against the freezing cold weather wearing only those clothes- this place is huge and you’ll need at least 2 hours to go around and enjoy the beauty of this palace. I have a good photographer (my ever so photo-enthusiast BF) so I won’t take credit on any of the pictures I’ve posted here..."
128,4.0,A must visit historical attraction when in Seoul. Beautiful landscape and very well kept. Many photo taking opportunities.
129,4.0,"If you had enough time to visit just one palace in Seoul, this would be the one.  Gyeongbokgung is the main royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty. Most of the visit focuses on building exteriors, grounds and courtyard though there are some buildings where you can look in through the door and snap a few photos.  Do consider the free guided tour that occurs throughout the day (1-1.5 hours) as well as the Changing of the Palace Guard Ceremony at 10:00 and 14:00. There is also a Gate Guard Duty performance at 11:00 and 13:00. And of course, you can always rent the popular hanbok attire for photo ops at nearby shops."
130,5.0,This place needs no review as it is a must see place while visiting Seoul. It is stunning and surreal. The changing of the guard happens at 10 am everyday and if you can be there at 9:45 you will be glad you did.
131,3.0,"If you've been to a few palaces in Asia and in South Korea, you will feel like you have seen it all. The area is paid to enter and there is quite a lot to see and luckily most of the displays have English so you can read about the history. However we felt that the area was a bit sparse in terms of things to do and did not really wow me compared to the other sites of Seoul. Be prepared to walk around for a couple of hours to cover most of the palace grounds."
132,4.0,"This is my second visit. Once in summer (no shade and very hot so I didn’t walk around much). This time in winter, I was able to walk around more. The changing of the guards is every hour, on the hour and is worth seeing. It’s free. The costumes are colourful and the drums are cool. The palace entrance is 3000 won. The grounds are expansive and besides the pavilions and buildings, it’s pretty sparse. There were plenty of people in traditional costumes taking photos. There is a folk museum too but I didn’t go in."
133,5.0,"Came on a guided tour. If not must join one of theirs (English ones 11.30 & 2.30 Mar-Dec Korean ones on the hour)The history is fascinating, as is the palace.Beautiful gardens. Enjoyed the two museums as well. Loved seeing the young people of many nationalities enjoying walking around in traditional Korean dress. Very sorry I missed the changing of the guard as didn't know about it until I read a review laterCame on a ship's tour, which we all thought was very poor value,  ($159) although it was easy being driven round the sights..Better to research to get the metro."
134,4.0,"Despite not being as big as the palaces in China, I still think Gyeongbok Palace is one place not too be missed when you visit Korea.We were there for only one hour as we arrived late in the day. So please check the hours of operation. They really chased you out when it was time to close."
135,5.0,"My wife and I love attending palaces, museums etc in the countries we visit. We attended the palace and partook in the free tour. It was extremely informative and we really enjoyed it. Further more there was no request for tips or any form of payment. As the tour ended our guide thanked us for our time, wished us all the best on our holiday and then walked off. She was extremely polite and informative the entire tour and I actually felt like I wanted to tip her given how brilliant she was. I would highly recommend taking the free tour as you get so much more out of it that just walking around yourself"
136,5.0,A historical place must visit for first timer in Seoul. Huge landscape and admiring the buildings that much influenced by Chinese.
137,4.0,"We took the metro and went to Gyeongbokgung Palace. Unfortunately, I didn’t rent Hanbok because it was really cold that time. It was -16 degrees Celcius when we toured the grounds of the palace. There were student volunteers who would tour you around the Palace explaining the history and the areas in detail. They are English-speaking tour guides and it’s for free. The students are training to be a teacher in the future that’s why they volunteer to tourists who wants to know the Palace’s history. The whole ground will take you more than an hour to cover. The grounds were huge and if you watch Korean historical dramas, most of the scenes were shot here (I particularly like Hwarang and Love in the Moonlight). Gyeongbokgung PalaceGyeongbokgung Station (Seoul Subway Line 3) and Exit 5.SUBWAY: 14mis: Euljiro 1 - - Euljiro 3 - - - - Gyeongbokgung"
138,4.0,"It’s very beautiful place with castle and some garden. Also very popular for tourist and field trip students and kids! I saw many people wearing korean traditional dress, heard the entry fee is free if you wear those!"
139,4.0,"A huge place, to start with. I was in their hanbok so I got free entry. If you chose to wear traditional korean outfits, you are entitled to a free entry in to not only Gyeongbokgung, but Changedeokgung, Changyeonggung and Jongmyo Shrine. (Those were the places I went.)Didn't had enough time to actually explore the entire Gyeongbokgung but would come back for more - leisure strolls!"
140,3.0,We spent 2hrs there in the morning.the palace is very nice to take photos.you can get a free english speaking guide.which you have to to understand about everything.at 11am you can watch changing of the guards at the main gate except on tuesdays.it is not suitable for wheelchairs as there are many steps.
141,4.0,"ThisIs the biggest palace at Seoul, so, really the only one you need to visit. Palaces at South Korea are just not as impressive as in Japan, so, i think a visit to one is sufficient."
142,4.0,"Nice grounds to see. Some areas were closed for restoration when I went. Make sure to be there for the changing of the guard ceremony. A lot of it is outdoors, so if you're coming in winter, be prepared. A lot of visitors stopped by the gift shop / cafe to warm up for a bit."
143,1.0,"This is a sad replica of the Forbidden City in China. The litter around the place is depressing, too. Save your money and go to Beijing instead."
144,5.0,"I would say this place has been the most enjoyable for me throughout my trip in seoul. Very nice and well maintained palace which says a lot about the history of koreans. From 10am to 4pm, there is also a changing guard ceremony which should not be missed. I have also heard that if you wear a hanbok, entrance is free! Do check it out if you visit Seoul!"
145,5.0,This place brings so much traditional feels for the millenials. I also recommend wearing hanbok while visiting this place to give you more superb traditional experience
146,4.0,What a cool place to visit. There is a lot of history here to see. There is a museum next door too that is connected and I believe part of the exhibit that has history displays. There was a changing of the guard at the front entrance of the Palace that was cool too.
147,4.0,Good place to walk around for an hour or two and see how the palace was organized. All outdoors so dress appropriately for weather.
148,4.0,The area is pretty large so it takes at least two hours to go it thru. I recommend to take a guided tour at least for a some time to hear some important things about the place and the Korean history as well.
149,3.0,"Since much of Korean culture was destroyed by the Japanese, all the buildings in the palace are replicas of actual buildings.  Interesting if you are a history buff but not particularly impressed with the structures themselves."
150,3.0,"Nothing much except that’s it’s really big. Went during winter, lots of space to walk around but nothing really fascinating"
151,4.0,Enjoyed our visit to the palace an was lovely to walk around (also close to other attractions such as Bukchon Hanock Village and Jogyesa temple. Admission cost was 3000 won.
152,4.0,4/5 only because the construction at the ticket booth continued during the ceremony. Very clean and historic.
153,4.0,The Royal Palace is a short distance walk from our hotel. It was very busy on our day of the visit but the palace area is vast so have plenty of areas to move and walk about and don't really feel crowded. There are many individual 'gates' within the complex but they are all spread out including some in the quiet corners too.
154,5.0,"Beautiful, historical palace -a photographer's dream setting! A must see in Seoul! Not expensive! Get there early to beat the crowds!"
155,3.0,"You will consider the Gyeongbokgung Palace a average asian palace if you've been to Imperial Palace / Forbidden city in China or Angkor Wat in Cambodia. Hence, don't expect too much once you enter the Gyeongbokgung compound. If your main purpose is just to take pictures, you can spend a max of 4 hours roving around the palace. The highlight of our visit in Gyeongbokgung is the changing of guards which is scheduled every 9AM and 2PM."
156,5.0,"The palace grounds are massive. You can spend hours walking around Gyeongbokgung Palace. Lots of interesting architecture and statues. Palace was under some construction at the time but didn't take away from the experience. Lots to see so give yourself a couple hours at least. The Museum inside the palace grounds has a lot of exhibits to see as well. If you're a fan of history, this is a must see."
157,4.0,"To be fair, all the buildings that we can see today are accurate replica. The original palace was burnt to ground in 1592. Several buildings were restored in 1890s, while the rest were reconstructed in last 20 years. So, the palace actually contains less historical value compares to Changdeokgung and Deoksugung. However, the Gyeongbokgung is the original ruling palace of Joseon Kings. That attracted us to visit the palace, to see to prosperity and greatness of the Korean Dynasty at its best.The palace is huge, so allocate at least one to two hours to walk around the compound while enjoy the beauty of the gardens, especially in autumn. Wearing comfortable shoes can ensure a good time walking through the ground with sand and uneven stone tiles. There are a few stairs to climb as well. Checking the weather forecast is important so that we can bring an umbrella in case of raining. We found only one cafe available at the souvenir shop. So we need to bring enough water to keep us hydrated if we are planning to stay long in the palace."
158,4.0,"Had so much fun touring this palace, imagining the drama and intrigues within its walls!  You MUST, I repeat, MUST plan to visit first a hanbok rental place nearby and enjoy wearing this traditional costume while visiting the palace.  This made the visit especially memorable and fun.PROS:* Super-fun wearing hanbok (traditional Korean costume) while visiting the palace* Free entrance into the palace, while wearing hanbok.* Lots of opportunity for photos in this historic place, while wearing traditional costume.CONS:* Chilly in November (40F), but manageable * Hanbok rental costs more than palace admission, but hey, it's fun.* Did not rent the audio tour because my husband said it wouldn't match his costume (hahaha!), but would have added much to the tour.Rented hanbok for 3-4 hours because hate to rush back, but we only took 2.5 hours because it was chilly and any longer would not have been necessary."
159,4.0,Amazing view during late November. The palace was covered in snow when we went so many photo opportunities from outside to inside. Didn't get to finish exploring though cause boyfriend's sports shoes got soaked in puddle from the melted snow...so a heads up to those planning to go to wear proper winter shoes or else you're going to have frozen feet the rest of the walk.
160,3.0,"There are 5 palaces in Seoul, we visited Gyeongbob Palace as recommended the best among the 5. The tour guide told us that most of the palaces are rebuilt because they were burnt down during world war II. I'm not impressed of this best palace. It looks fake. Cannot compare with those I saw in China and Japan. Can give it a miss unless you want to kill time."
161,5.0,This is the largest palace of 5 in Seoul. Free entrance for whom wear hanbok. Without hanbok the ticket is 300won.
162,3.0,Nice still through the park.Model of the ancient Palace.The Impression May be better when the Grass is Not Brown and Dry as it was.
163,5.0,"conveniently located nearby the subway, Worth to visit. Buchon village is 15 mins walking distance with a lot of handbook (Korean costume) rental shop and locate clothing/ souvenir shops."
164,5.0,Rent the Hanbok and walk around the palace like royalty.Be sure to time your visit for the changing of the guard.
165,4.0,My first introduction to Korean history was a relaxed walk in the palace grounds. I opted for the English language audio guide. Saw the change of guards and enjoyed seeing the many visitors in traditional outfits. I appreciated the effort to preserve Korean culture and present wonderful examples of architecture.
166,4.0,My boyfriend and I had a great afternoon strolling around the grounds of the Palace. Even though it was a busy day the grounds are so big you barely notice. We had the headset for a self guided tour which made it great for zigzag through and finding some less traveled sections. Beautiful architecture was great for pictures. Really enjoyed our time at the palace.
167,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace was the first of many temples I visited around Seoul. This one was definitely the largest and most crowded. I was here during the week so there were a lot of school groups and tours. Admission is really cheap and they do tours as well. I opted to explore by myself, and really tried to experience the history. Unfortunately a lot of the palace was under construction when I went, so I could not see 100% of it. There were so many other buildings and alleys to walk around and see, I was still here for a couple hours. I really enjoyed the scenic mountains in the background, made for some great photo opportunities."
168,4.0,"It’s pretty cool here! Walking around the grounds of the palace, and it’s pretty big too so can spend a good 1-2 hours here. Make sure you come right when they open to avoid the crowds! However the downside is we went to the dessert place inside the palace and wanted to order the “royalty” sweets set, and they told us it won’t be ready until afternoon time. They also offered free guided tours at specific times in different languages throughout the day!"
169,5.0,"The tour to the palace will give you insights of Korean history, particularly the monarchy. We had a great tour guide, Sharon Yi of VIP travel who gave us detailed historical accounts of Korean Peninsula history and the dynasty that once led the monarchy.The Changing of the Guards was also an interesting experience. Although it was in a smaller scale than what I have seen in other countries, it's always good to witness this spectacular display of a nation's culture. The concept and mechanics are similar as in other countries, but the uniforms are different.  Fun colors, interesting style. Palace tour takes a lot of walking. Palace grounds is a work in progress. Since most of it was destroyed during the war, the government is trying to rebuild, replicate and preserve whatever is left of it."
170,5.0,Beautiful and impressive palace.The museum is within the grounds and free to enter. Definitely worth a visit.The palace itself is fantastic. Walking around seeing so many girls in Hannibal makes you feel truly immersed in history. :)
171,5.0,"This palace is beautiful! You get a view of the mountains right behind the palace too. We came in hanboks so we didn't need to pay for entrance. It would have cost us 3000won (18 below is 1500won). You can find their national palace and folk museums inside. They also have a nice cafe where you can find good souvenirs. Lots of places to take photos at. It started drizzling and it added to the drama. They have a changing of the guard ceremony but we didn't get to see that. It happens evert 11am and 3pm. There are English, Japanese, and Chinese guides but you'd need to inquire in advance. Definitely a must go to place!"
172,4.0,"Arrived at the palace at around 9:15am, got our tickets and grabbed a coffee at the Palace Museum before the Changing of the Guard at 10am. Would strongly recommend the Changing of the Guard - was easily the highlight of our visit. After that, we spent about 45 minutes walking around the palace grounds. Without a tour, it's pretty hard to understand the importance of each individual building - if you get the chance to take a tour then definitely do it. After 45 minutes, we were  a little bored and ready to move on. It was entertaining watching everyone in their traditional costume take photos around the palace!"
173,5.0,A friend of ours recommended this place and we were surprised the gardens were beautiful some of the trees were loosing their leaves and the old buildings were pretty and you got to get a sneak peek at one of the buildings getting a upgraded lots of space
174,5.0,The palace is very near our hotel. We rented a hanbok costume and stroll in the palace. Wearing their national costume is a welcoming experience its like time travelling on how its like to be a royalty.
175,5.0,Just happened to be there on family culture day. Made it extra special. Anyone who wore traditional dress had there admission price waived. It was fun seeing all the Korean people dressed up. It seemed like they were having a blast. I would go back architecture was incredible.
176,5.0,We totally enjoyed our guided tour of the palace. Such an interesting historical landmark. Our guide was very informative and made sure we were looked after and safe.
177,5.0,"When I first entered the palace, I thought, oh that's all of it. Ok but so-so. Then I went to the back of the palace, and found another palace, the I went deeper, found another, then another, then another. Took me 3 hours to reach the end of the palace and I belive I still did not visit everything. There were the main hall, king's palace, queen palace, prince palace, library, the harem palace, the queen's garden... It's beautiful. They also has many attractions such as traditional music and dances for the tourist."
178,4.0,One of the five seoul palaces but the most important one. we attend first the guard change ceremony (very interesting) and then we went with the english guided visit offerd by seoul city by a very nice weather.The palace has a typical korean architecture and the garden are also so nice.A must during a stay in seoul
179,5.0,One of the best side that we found on our trip to Seoul.  Must try the King's Tea set meal that they offer at Royal Kitchen.the best time to visit are in summer since you can enjoy the beautiful landscape and pond the have in the castle.  Would love to pay visit one more time in nearest time.
180,4.0,"In my opinion, you can skip the Changdeokgung Palace but not this one. Try on a Hanbok and be one with the crowd in awe of the wonderful scenery --not to mention, the instagram-worthy spots too!"
181,5.0,"Highly recommended to rent a hanbok to tour this grand Palace. Many photogenic spots available for you to shoot. Don't worry, there'll be many others who is wearing hanbok too over there. Free entrance for those who are wearing hanbok."
182,5.0,"Wonderful to see and learn about the history of Korea, we visited in a Wednesday and it wasn’t overly crowded. Very beautiful. We had a small group and a guide who was enthusiastic about his tour which was great to have clear information and easy to walk around. Seoul N Tour company was excellent, confirming and communication with tours."
183,3.0,"Cheap enough to enter and as others have said, once you've seen one you've kinda seen them all.  Would recommend."
184,4.0,Venture in this place if you want to see historical architectures. Many locals and tourists visit here too.
185,5.0,"There are a lot of palaces in the Seoul, but this is the best of the lot. Very nice and well maintained....but NO visitors ..."
186,4.0,"Consider purchasing the royal palace pass that includes 4 palaces and the royal shrine for 10,000 (approx $8.80USD).Destroyed by a fire in 1592, it remained in ruins for over 270 years.  In 1867 it was restored...during the Japanese occupation a lot of damage occurred.  In 1915 over 90% of the buildings were destroyed.  In 1990 a new renovation project began.If you purchased the 4 palace package of tickets it is worth to see."
187,4.0,Went there in the morning and with the perfect weather it was a great stroll. Saw a lot of people wearing the traditional korean outfit. It has good history and make sure you grab a map as you go it for guidance.
188,5.0,Beautifully maintained buildings and gardens. A real onsite in to the history of Korea. So many people dress in traditional clothing to visit the palace. You can enjoy a tea ceremony of learn to make rice cakes. Allow several hours for your visit but dont miss it
189,4.0,"We enjoyed visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace very much. We were, unfortunately, there during a rainy patch. It would have been a lot more fun on a sunny day. Many visitors show up in traditional Korean dress and take photographs, which adds to the ambiance."
190,5.0,We spent a few hours living/wandering through the Josein Dynasty as we explored this palace. Easy access to the area by bus or Subway. We arrived in time to watch the guard change at the front gate and then wandered inside. Loved especially watching the gals in their period dresses taking each other’s pictures. It was a great day.
191,5.0,"Great Palace,, the architecture, the building and also perfect weather in October. One of the place you have to visit in Seoul."
192,5.0,"We got to the Palace about 9.45 am, just in time to watch the changing of the guard ceremony which was colourful and interesting. It took about 20 minutes and then we explored the palace and the gardens. It was extremely busy, many visitors opting to rent hanboks, the traditional Korean dress from shops nearby, and then posing at every opportunity for selfies or group photos. We opted not to do the free guided tour as the leaflets we got with the tickets gave us enough information and there are signboards beside each building, all in English as well as other languages. Given the number of visitors it would be hard to hear your guide unless you had individual audio devices and headphones (which I noticed some private groups had).The palace buildings are well preserved and interesting in themselves, but the gardens are equally lovely and as the grounds are quite extensive we spent much of our time just wandering around enjoying the scenery away from the crowds."
193,5.0,This is a hitoric and intesting 600 year old palace. Great view of the old and new parts of Sepul from the terrace. The Banquet hall is elegant and peaceful. Free admission.
194,4.0,"Was there for the free English tour. It was nice, i can understand that it won’t be too informative as it’s free tour after all. But the tour guide gave us some understanding of Korean king culture. A lot of people wearing hanbok to get in for free. Missed the change of guards because of the free tour. we would thought that they will arrange the tour timing so that tour started off with the change of guards. To have that nice flow"
195,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung - main palace in seoul. A must do on your Seoul tour list. A hugh palace area with wide green areas, a lot of temples and wonderful atmosphere. 3 bucks (2018) for Entrance is absolutely worth. ITip: f u want to top it costum in traditional hanbok clothes and feel like princess and prince charming with your beloved as many other couples do. Hanbok rental in nearby streets. (10.000W per 2hour). If u prefer more calm time for your visit avoid weekends. See u there"
196,4.0,Quite a number of structures displaying typical housing of past royalty. Well maintained and easy to get around. Large place and makes you think about what life was like in the past. Ceremonial changing of the guards was pretty neat to see as well. .
197,5.0,"With the entrance fee of 3000KRW for an adult, it is worthed to see the beauty of Palace and park with the background of the mountain. Besides that, you can see people wearing the traditional Hanbok walking around the palace. There is a museum where you can visit and have a look the antique things and the history of the Palace."
198,5.0,That’s what someone we met there said. It’s like Buckingham palace Korean style in that they have their fancy guards too at the gate.  The grounds are beautiful and can’t  believe how many buildings they have rebuilt. Very traditional architecture. Very central to walk to other interesting places. The president’s home and various embassies are directly behind the temple. You can’t go in the gated compound of the president and embassies but it is interesting never-the-less.  The Museum of Korean Folk History is right beside the compound. Also worth seeing.
199,3.0,Quite ok if you’re not rushing for time to shop and prefer sightseeing. It gets more interesting after you are half-way done where you get to see smaller designated rooms/areas meant for various functions.
200,5.0,A must see attraction in Seoul.  Got in free because it was a national holiday.  Beautiful buildings. Lots of photo opportunities.
201,5.0,"Amazing palace in centre of seoul. Got some great shots, especially of moutains one side, modern skyscrapers the other. Lots of english friendly exhibits and helpful staff. Plenty to see for an afternoon/ half day. A real must see for any first time visitor to Seoul."
202,4.0,Get there early and watch the changing of the guard at 10:00. Wander around for a while and see the old buildings.
203,4.0,"If you are in Seoul, this is a must-go place. Beautiful, beautiful palace. Big compound. Join the guided tour to understand its history better. You can easily spend 3 hours here."
204,5.0,Excellent place to visit when in Seoul.  If you speak English they offer free tours in English 2 or 3 times a day.  Check times before going.  You do have to admission fee unless you are 65 or older. Tour last about 1 hour.  You can spend some additional time on your own.
205,5.0,The beauty of this palace is beyond question. We visited the palace with the traditional Korean costume. At the beginning I was very skeptical about this idea but it turned out to be a unique experience. Then I figured out there were about 5% visitors dressing the same so we didn't look strange at all. It is definitely memorable to walk in the ancient palace with this costume!
206,5.0,Korea’s main palace. Walk The whole vicinity for half a day. Worth it to have a feel of the Korean imperial culture
207,4.0,"What we can admire currently is the result of the modern day government's great effort of rebuild / restoration because like too many other historical sites in Korea it was unfortunately heavily destroyed by Japan in various invasions throughout the centuries.This main palace is quite large and nice, many interesting things to see - except the changing guards performance which we found ordinary and boring. Skip it during the performance times than you will have the palace to yourself quietly : )"
208,4.0,"Located in the centre of the city, this is easy to walk to from most hotels with the added benefit of escaping modern life as soon as you walk in to the outer courtyard.The buildings are stunning, changing of the guard ceremony is something to watch and a must for photographers and tourists alike."
209,5.0,"While visiting Seoul in September 2018, My husband & I took one hour free English tour provided by the palace.  I believe they provide two English tours per day.  The tour schedule was posted in the ticket office.  We enjoyed the tour very much & learned about not only a part of Korean history but also current cultural historical connections. I am glad we took the tour.  We also watched a change of guard ceremony which I wasn’t too impressed with.  Overall it was a nice 1/2 day tour at the palace."
210,5.0,A must see when in South korea.They have the exchange in guards ceremony that is entertaining.  Great tour if you are into palaces.
211,5.0,"We visited on a Wednesday and the palace was quite busy. It is a very good experience to see this palace. There are many people dressed in the traditional Korean attire which is lovely to look at and get some photos of.The queue for the tickets wasn’t bad at all, only 5 minutes long.Tickets very reasonably priced! Equivalent of 5 Euro for a ticket.There are many areas to walk around and explore within the palace boundaries.All buildings have explanations in English and Korean which was nice to be able to understand.The changing of the guard happens at 2pm and is a must see! It is directly inside the gates and does get very busy for this so be sure to be there 10 minutes before to get the best view.A lovely day exploring traditional ancient Korea."
212,5.0,In my opinion this is the most remarkable place on your trip to Seoul. You get a feel for how korea used to be in past and it's very easy to get here using the subway. Check the closing times though as i believe it closes around 5pm most the time .
213,5.0,Beautiful palace grounds - views are spectacular with the mountains forming the backdrop to the palace.  Lots of photo opportunity places as long as you are able to find a time when there will be less crowds.
214,3.0,"You will know you are at the correct place once nearby.. There would be A LOT of people dressed in traditional Korean costumes walking all over inside and out. You can rent these at shops nearby, ranging from 7500 Won to 15000 Won. With these costumes, you would get free entrance to the palace. If you do not want to play dress up, there is a small entrance fee. After entering the front gates, you will soon see the main congregation hall. Surrounding it is a vast area mixed with other palace buildings and a nice garden and lake. It would take up to a whole day to cover the entire area. Very picturesque."
215,5.0,I personally love the garden of the palace. It's a huge palace located at the centre of the city. Even though there were many tourists but it doesn't feel crowded due to huge size of the place.
216,5.0,First it is a perfect mix between the modern city and the culture and traditional buildings. Is some of the most interesting points from Seoul
217,4.0,"First some top tipsClosed on Tuesdays ( well it was when we went)We wanted to see the changing of the gaurd at 10.00 hrs - it starts very promptly. Stand on the right hand side to watch, as you are near the drum and effectively everything marches by twice as they leave the parade square.Best tip, last Wednesday of every month is Korean culture day..........its free!!!!!!!!!Geat place with good history, we took a free English speaking tour. This met at 11.00 hrs inside the second gate on the right. There is a meeting post you can see as you go in. This was very beneficial.Gaurds I am told are actors rather than military. Beards all look great........from a distance.Nice clean toilets in the museum , housed in a modern building on the far left of the first main square where the changing of the gaurd takes place."
218,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung used to be the main palace of the Joseon dynasty and out of the different palaces in Seoul, it is definitely larger and grander in scale.The palace is consisted on several areas. The main grounds is where the throne room is situated, with a huge surrounding plaza and gates. This is the most crowded area as many people would want to take photos here and being here makes you feel like you're in a historical drama.There are many smaller areas to explore around the main palace if you're a history buff and if you want a more in depth explanation, do check their website for guided tours.It takes about an hour to three hours to cover the entire area depending on how thorough you want to be and your walking speed, but this place is well worth the visit. While not as mystical as the Changdeokgung Palace, Gyeongbokgung is the palace to visit if you can only visit one palace on Seoul.There are two cafes in the palace grounds as well and visitors need to pay an entrance fee. If you have the time (1-2 days), I strongly suggest getting the Palace Pass at 10,000 won that allows you access to the notable palaces and shrines in Seoul."
219,5.0,"Beautiful complex, georgeous painting, very reaonably priced but go before you have spent a lot of time walking already-the complex is huge and you can walk for 2 or 3 hours"
220,4.0,The palace is pretty though a bit bare compared to Indian and European palaces. The walk around the gardens was a delight.
221,5.0,It was such a pretty place.. could spend a few hours walking in the palace grounds. However it would be more helpful if there were more information written in English as language can be an issue sometimes though people are very polite it's difficult to get your point across.
222,5.0,"Visited gorgeous Gyeongbokgung Palace in August 2018 and was wowed by the beauty and size of the complex.  First of all, our visit was enhanced through a free guided tour arranged prior to our arrival to Seoul with the City of Seoul Walking Tour. The guide met us near the ticket booth at 10 am, just in time to watch the change of guards ceremony. The guide spoke excellent English and was very knowledgeable about the palace and Korean history. Better yet , there was only one other couple in addition to us. So it was almost like a private guided tour - sure beats the regular tour from the palace. We were also pleasantly surprised that when we asked about senior discount admission tickets, we were asked to show identification documents (and we only had with us Ontario driver’s licenses), the ticket lady gave us free admission tickets. What generosity, even for foreigners!Most of the Gyeongbokgung buildings were beautifully reconstructed and maintained. The complex was one of the best palaces that I have visited in my travels, especially the Heungnyemun Gate 興禮門，the Geunjeogjeon (Throne Hall, 勤政殿), and Gyeonghoeru (Royal Banquet Hall, 慶會楼）with its beautiful pond and gardens. Our guide knew all the intricacies of the various buildings, how they were used, the best angles to take pictures and the different stone sculptures. It was a very interesting tour. We ended the tour at the rear gate of the palace after the emperor’s library and had a view of the current Korean Presidential Blue House. Don’t miss this palace and take advantage of the generosity of the City of Seoul!"
223,5.0,Great value of Korean Culture and Tradition dates back to thousand years.History lovers will definitely enjoy this gigantic palace with great views and excellent architecture
224,5.0,"it's already my second time visiting, but still amazed by its design and construction. Strongly recommended to spend at least a couple of hours inside and around that neighborhood. Worthy of checking in."
225,4.0,This is a beautiful and peaceful palace of historic significance.  Save your taxi money and simply take the subway there - very easy and direct.  I would also recommend going as early as possible to avoid the noisy tour groups.  The palace opens at 9 am.  Bring a parasol if it's summer and drinking water as there is very limited shade available.  There are free guided tours available but I recommend either hiring an audio guide or purchasing a guide book for 500 Won - you can then visit at your leisure.  A good solid hour of walking the site and returning to the courtyard in front of the palace at 10 am will allow visitors to watch a re-enactment of the changing of the guards.  While the process is not exciting - the pageantry and costumes are beautiful!
226,5.0,"It is inspiring to walk across the wide squares in front of the king's palace, or to take refuse from the intense summer heat in one of the minor houses, where doors leading to secret paths remain close and silent to the occasional visitor."
227,5.0,"Seoul features a number of palaces dotted across the city, but Gyeongbokgung would have to be the most impressive in addition to being the most centrally located to other city highlights. The enormous grounds feature a number of buildings, gardens and pagodas, all stunningly presented. Locals and tourists add to the attraction by dressing in traditional Korean attire, which makes for great photos and a more authentic sense of time and place. Allow several hours to visit the site, as there is also an interactive museum of Korean history as well as a smaller children's museum (both included in the entry price) and the expansive area features plenty of pathways where you will discover totems and shrines. A number of cafes can be found throughout. The surrounding neighbourhood includes contemporary art galleries, history galleries and the Bukchon Hanok Village (traditional wooden houses)."
228,4.0,The grounds were huge! Lots of walking and pls get a free English speaking guide(believe they are student volunteers) if your are a tourist.  They are available at one of the exits from the metro. Lots of history and many photo opportunities.  Many people rented hanboks to wear for taking photographs. It would have been a lot more pleasant if the weather was not so hot.(was 37 degrees when we were there) We were walking around looking for vending machines but there was none. Neither were there water coolers. We finally found a cafe near to the entrance.
229,4.0,Lots of different parts to wander round and explore. This is a haven of peace and beauty in amongst a bustling city. Great if you have an hour to spend and are staying centrally.
230,5.0,"Like other people have stated, the entrance is free if you're wearing a hanbok and it was definitely worth it in my opinion. Me and my boyfriend both rented them (rent for one was 20000w for 4 hours in our case) and they were so beautiful. A lot of people are wearing them also so you don't have to be shy.The changing of the guard ceremony was imteresting to see. It was also explained in English, I am not sure if that's every time or if we were just lucky to be there at the right time though.The palace itself is very beautiful and the palace grounds is a very large area that you can easily spend a lot of time exploring. It is also cool when you look to the city and see the modern cityline outside of the historical palace wall. A mix of old and new.We also visited a traditional tea house inside the palace grounds and while it probably was more expensive than the tea places outside the grounds it was very nice. Their fruit tea was honestly one of the best I have ever tried."
231,5.0,"There are five palaces in Seoul and we decided to visit this one only. I think most of it has been reconstructed but there must have been about 100 buildings in the compound. It is good to get your photo with the guards by the main gate, probably the most photographed Koreans in the country. In several of the rooms there were displays of the people going about their business several hundred years ago. We spent about 3 hours at the palace and it was well worth while."
232,5.0,"The Royal palace in Seoul is a great attraction to visit, much has been written about the palace on TA.  This is a huge complex of buildings and outdoor areas to explore, that is why I highly recommend taking one of the free guided tours which are offered daily in four languages, English, Korean, Japanese and Chinese, then after the tour wander around on your own. The tour lasts between 1-1.5 hours depending on the size of the group and the guide.  Our guide was most informative as she lead our group of about twenty five around the complex.  We were told many interesting stories and facts about the life in the Royal Palace, about family members, details of the architecture and general life in the palace.  The Palace is inexpensive to visit, 3000 won/adult, but I believe if you come dressed in traditional Korean costume you can get in for free."
233,5.0,"Compare to the palaces in China, the size of the palace is small. But when you know the history, you will realize how valuable this palace is to Korean."
234,5.0,"One of the best experience in Korea, it’s a must visit if you intend to west Korean hanbok especially to girls, lots of people wearing them around the palace, it’s not big but the environment is conducive enough for you to take photos without problems, you can rent the hanbok near the palace, I rented mine just next to the palace about usd$30++,A must visit if you are in Korea!"
235,5.0,This palace is the greatest palace of all palaces in Seoul in my opinion. Both in size as in attractiveness. Beautiful buildings and landscape. If you want to visit only one palace this is the one.
236,5.0,"My husband and I wanted to go back to Hong Kong (our hometown) celebrated his birthday.  We stayed in Seoul for 5 days and then to Hong Kong for 5 days.Seoul was very nice and clean, younger Korean speak English.  We didn’t have enough time to visit all palaces, I picked Gyeongbokgung Palace to see the changing of the Royal Guards.  It was amazing!  Seoul is easy to get around with great rail system.    We would go again to the Gyeongbokgung Palace again when next time we visit in Seoul again."
237,4.0,This was super interesting to see. The tickets are only $3 to go inside and walk around. The grounds are expanse which is crazy because it sits in the middle of Seoul. There were guards dressed up along with several of the visitors. Men and women wearing transitional outfits. Unsure if this is the norm or we were there on a special day. It’s mostly outdoors so prepare for rain or shine. The walking is easy. A section of the pond was closed for reconstruction. Definitely worth seeing if in Seoul.
238,5.0,Seoul has been destroyed by invasions and catastrophes several times so you have to have in mind that most part of the monuments have been heavily restored. Having this is mind is a beautiful place to understand Korean culture
239,5.0,"Really beautiful palace grounds. Lots of interesting areas, with different views. There’s an area for traditional performances. And a crafts shop. Throne room in view and 7 story pagoda."
240,5.0,Very nice palace. Think Forbidden City but on a smaller scale. Great recreation of changing of the guard.
241,5.0,"If you're in Seoul, you really need to visit this place. Amazing, also has a good museum inside which is worth a look."
242,5.0,"Most the group tour this is number one attraction to visit, we came on hop-on hop-offSeoul city tour bus A is Downtown and Palace course, we got on at Myeongdong, it took about 35 minutes to get here, along the way, we pass many attractions which we already visited, still fun the see all part of the city, this is a very big Palace with many buildings, many tourist young and old dress in the traditional costume, taking pictures with their cell phone, good memory photos to bring home to show friends, it's a huge area, easily take couple hour or more, you can see the change of guard on schedule 10 am and 2 pm."
243,4.0,The first palace built in the Joseon dynasty - very majestic and impressive. Went on a guided tour of the palace 2 years ago and this time we stumbled upon a late opening in the evening. Entrance was only 3000 won and there were 500 tickets reserved for foreigners. There were many people in hanbok and performances on a stage so it was a great atmosphere. The palace looked stunning lit up. A must-visit in Seoul!
244,5.0,With rented hanbok we enjoyed the palace and it was really a wonderful experience! Definately must see!
245,5.0,"This place is pretty big! Very pretty and picturesque, lots of areas to walk around and enjoy. People wearing traditional clothing, snack shop with coffee etc available (pricey though!) we spent 3 hours here in total and enjoyed it."
246,5.0,A beautiful peaceful place in the center of the city. I recommend buying the integrated palace ticket as it offers great saving
247,5.0,Visited the palace while in S. Korea (Seoul) for my sons wedding.  This was a great stop and great lesson in S. Korea’s history.
248,4.0,It's a lovely place for selfie lovers. Especially when you dressed up in Hanbok and experience your time in the palace.
249,4.0,We joined the English free guided tour for the palace and gained many interesting insights to the palace that we wouldn't have known otherwise!
250,5.0,"beautiful place. learned a lot about the history of Korea. Also they offer free guided tours which was really cool! Our guide was a high school senior who graduates soon (Riley), she was very aware and informative about the history of Korea and the Palace. Definitely worth the visit. Also if you dress up in traditional Korean clothing you get in for free."
251,5.0,"Historical Korean castle. It's quite huge, authentic and kept in good conditions. Highly recommend for those interested in history."
252,3.0,"Gyeongbokgung is conveniently located near it's same name metro station. Managed to catch the changing of guards before entering the compound (entrance fee is 3000won per adult).Within the compound, because we didn't go for the guided tour, most of the time we felt quite lost :(I would think a guided tour would add more content and insights, rather than just random walking and photo taking within the compound."
253,5.0,"Also one of the more beautiful palaces of Seoul but besides walking around for a good couple of hours inside these grounds, the rotation of the guards performance was the highlight. Don't remember how often it happens but be on the outside of the entrance when it does. It takes place at the entrance near Gwanghwuman."
254,5.0,A comfortable park located in the city downtown are of Seoul. We enjoyed walking through and learning the history behind this site.
255,4.0,"We took a free guided tour as it was offered at certain times, Interesting sights and very good with a guide that gives you information about the traditions and history of the place."
256,4.0,Largest and most famous palace in South Korea. Identical to Forbidden city in China. Beautiful Korean architecture. Many locals comes there wearing traditional costumes called Hanbok. Not only for locals anyone can hire these outfits and entry will be free of charge. We were there on time to watch royal guard ceremony in their traditional uniforms carrying flags & weapons. Unique on it own way.Beautiful garden with cherry blossoms in season. Must stop at Hyangwanji pond to see the grand pavilion. Palace closes at 6 pm. Wear comfy shoes .Great place to see their culture and traditions.
257,5.0,A must to visit. Very big place so we did not cover the whole area. Spent about 1.5 hours inside... There’s a small fee to enter the palace and it’s crowded everywhere.. You may want to find out the timing for changing of guards. Nothing interesting but we so happen to be there when it happened.
258,4.0,"This is a great tourist attraction.  They make no bones that the palace is not an original and was rebuilt in 1868 after being ruined for 300 years.  At 10AM they have a tourist spectacle when they do a changing of the guard ceremony which is very colourful.  That takes place in the first courtyard, which is a huge enclosure.  From here you proceed to various staterooms, sleeping quarters and then a small garden.  The restoration has been nicely done so you can get a feel of how the place used to be. The chimneys are interesting, being outside of the buildings and I think there is one original fireplace and chimney from the 1360's.  It was a shame that when we were there the gardens behind the main palace that had a pavillion in the middle of a lake of waterlillies, was actually closed.  Admission was 3000 won and there are plenty of bus stops right by the front gate."
259,5.0,bring a hat or umbrella but its great. with enough facilities for whatever you need. there is even an MRT entrance  within the palace ground
260,5.0,We visited all five of the big palaces in the city and found Gyeongbokgung together with Changdeokgung to be the most impressive ones. While you can't really enter any of the buildings it's worth a visit for the impressive view on the gate alone.
261,4.0,This palace is really nice to see even knowing that it's all reconstructed. The this is that you need to take your time to go around because it takes at least 2-3 hours to go around and see everything. The library at the end is also very nice.
262,3.0,Didn't enter because it's too hot. End up visit the national museum nearby which is great to visit as well.
263,5.0,A must to visit this place when you are in SeoelThis Ares is completely renovatie and give you A good idea of the past. The buildings and the area inside are wonderpil. Surely you wil make beautifull pictures
264,5.0,"It was a wonderful experience visiting this place. We went to Anguk station to rent a hanbok before going to Gyeongbukgung. This palace is huge and beautiful, great places for picture. Free entrance should you dress in hanbok, must visit at least once."
265,3.0,"It was fun wearing Hanbok, Korean traditional outfit, and walking around the palace. Plenty of rental shops around. Free entrance if you are wearing Hanbok!  However, there isn’t much to see but great for pictures!"
266,4.0,"I rented a hanbok and visit Gyeongbukgung, if you do that you can get in for free! However eventhough it was mid-week, it was very crowded and it was hard to enjoy the scene fully. But I definitely enjoyed it!"
267,5.0,"We only had two days in Seoul and this was one of the first places we headed to see. I am very glad we did - the palace was beautiful and its surrounding grounds large and stunning. You could easily spend a whole day just walking around and taking in the different areas, however I would recommend setting aside two hours for a good feel of the place. It is definitely worth paying the low fee of the entrance ticket to fully enjoy the grounds and not just the entrance area.What really adds to the historic feeling is the many beautiful dresses worn by Koreans. Shops in the area will rent out historic costumes and many Korean girls and couples can be seen taking photos within the palace grounds. It's a beautiful sight that's worth seeing. If you're daring, perhaps rent out a costume yourself for a nice photo-shoot? The grounds definitely have loads of opportunities for lovely pictures than cannot be taken anywhere else."
268,4.0,It's just Palace which no longer original. But it's still worth spending time while in Seoul. And all the buildings look the same.
269,4.0,"If you only have time to view the famous changing of guards, you do not need to purchase the admission fees to the palace. For those who rented traditional Korean costume and wish to take more pictures within the huge grounds of the palace, you will need to purchase entrance tickets. The changing of guards is an impressive ceremony and worth the wait."
270,5.0,"The changing of the Guard is very impressive!...With their traditional blue and red uniforms, colorful flags and traditional weapons, it kind of takes you momentarily back into the past. And the end you even get to take pictures with some of the guards, making the event more memorable and a part of the visit not to be missed.The architecture of Palace is beautiful. Within it's nice and well maintained garden, a there's an uncountable number of buildings, which in some places lead your eyes to a perfect fusion of pointy rooftops, and overhangs decorated in predominantly green colors, as well as interior ceilings decorated in perfect details.With many people visiting on a Saturday, it was sometimes a bit difficult to take pictures in the most popular spots, but Koreans are very nice and cooperative people, hence no problem.A lovely place to visit, an experience not to be missed!..."
271,5.0,Spent the morning at the palace arrived at 1000 for the changing of the guards then free English tour for about one hour starting at  1100am
272,4.0,Worth a visit when in Seoul.  Enjoyed the grounds and changing of the guards ceremony.  The entrance fee is very affordable and worth the cost.  Must see.
273,5.0,"This palace is worth visiting if you are in Seoul. Will need to pay an entrance fee but the place is big enough for a couple of hours of touring. Do check out the timing for change of Guards ceremony, will be worth watching. Remember to check out the museum too, free admission for palace visitors."
274,5.0,"Most all the Palace buildings were demolished during the Japanese occupation in the early 1900s and restored in the 1990s.    The buildings are still stunning with mountains in the background to the north and west.     When we were there, there were a great number of school children as well as about 10% of people walking around in hanboks, the traditional dress.   There are free guided tours available.    We were with a private tour."
275,4.0,It offers a nice atmosphere to walk around and learn the history. Morning time to visit is better as we have to walk a lots
276,5.0,This site is definitely worth waiting for in the evening. The lighting shows the fabulous colors of the facades and decorative woodwork. Enjoy the walk through the walled palace and gardens.
277,4.0,Probably the most famous for palace visitors in Seoul. Wear hanbok for a free entrance to the grounds. Nice place for taking pictures.
278,3.0,We only went to this palace due to the limited time we had.Perhaps it's ignorance and lack of knowledge but it was one big building (palace i assume) in a huge enclosed area.The best part for us however was to dress in traditional hanboks and take pictures- again perhaps ignorance on my part to not being able to appreciate the history and significance of this.
279,4.0,This is the only tour we did guided in Seoul. The rest of the attractions we went to unguided. Korea has such a great history 6ou have to get the guided tour to bring everything together. Must see. 1000 there is a changing of the guard ceremony which I highly recommend. Great tour.
280,3.0,"Happened to walk into the palace thinking of going to the palace museum and coincidentally it was exactly the time for the guards changing ceremony.It was certainly interesting and quite an experience. Not so sure, but I do think they keep to traditions and everything is authentic.The whole ceremony took about 15 mins. There was Chinese, English, Japanese commentary alongside Korean.Kinda pity the guards though, had to stand straight without moving a muscle while out in the cold weather. But I guess back them hundreds of years ago that's what they did."
281,5.0,"One of the many palaces in Seoul, this one is a must see. The grounds and palace are well kept and you will be sure to get a taste of Korean history. Be sure to do a tour if you can."
282,4.0,It’s the largest palace in Korea so it’s huge and impressive but there is a lot of walking around in the sun (there is little shade there). Wear comfortable shoes!
283,3.0,"We came here after visiting Changdeokgung Palace, as we had the Secret Garden tour booked for 10:30am, so by the time we got here, it was already super crowded. Changdeokgung was nothing like this, not many people at all. Anyway, so we bought tickets and started walking around. The grounds are huge, so many houses etc. to see but I wasn't as impressed with Gyeongbokgung as I was with Changdeokgung. I have to say though that the Secret Garden at Changdeokgung was my favorite things, so maybe that's way. If I'd come again, I'd visit first thing in the morning, or just before they close. It's still nice though, not to miss."
284,4.0,"What impressive about this place it is in the heart of Seoul. A mini escape. we arrived on a Wednesday and it was free entry. Beautiful grounds, amazing history. When I go back to Seoul I will go back for another look as it is definitely worthwhile."
285,5.0,"Having visited the Forbidden Palace in Beijing, the Seoul counterpart is smaller, less crowded, more quaint, but no less grand. The aesthetics and beauty are Superior to Beijing in almost every way.Also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the place feels earthy and calm. Of course, the city has sprouted up all around, obscuring what must have once been a superlative view. The palace and gardens are quite magnificent. There is quite a bit of greenery and foilage unlike the Forbidden City. While it is impossible to not compare the two, the Seoul Palace stands on its own as a place of magnificance and wonder. Get the Royal Pass and visit at least the Secret Garden and the Temple across the street. Worth the extra few 1000 won(2-3 dollars)"
286,5.0,"One your trip to Seoul you have to visit one of the palaces. This one is the biggest. I’d describe it  more like a compound . In that it has many buildings and courtyards within the outside walls. The cost is just a few dollars to enter the main gate. You will likely see folks dressed in traditional Korean attire waking around taking pictures etc. it’s popular to do, and encouraged in that they get in free if they are dressed accordingly. We saw at least two wedding parties taking photos there. There are English translations on most displays. I believe you can rent audio guides if you want. The palace grounds are large, with ponds and courtyards. It’s a very night stroll around to check it all out."
287,4.0,"This is a nice looking palace with large grounds.The experience is heightened by dressing in the colourful traditional Korean clothes called hanbok. You get free entry to the palace grounds if you wear a hanbok and you won't be out of place as there are many others wearing hanbok as well. We were able to get men and women hanbok for 5000 won each for 2 hours, at ABC Hanbok Rental which is located on the second floor of a building across the road from the palace on the Geonchunmun Gate side.Changing of guard ceremonies at 1pm and 2pm were worth watching, as well as guard training at 1:35pm. A 'Mexican wave' of swords drill was particularly impressive! There are free guided tours as well. There was an English speaking guided tour at 1:30pm, which seemed quite popular. We didn't go to that as the timing clashed with the guard training session.A good place to get a photo is the banquet hall to the left side surrounded by water and mountain in the background."
288,5.0,Absolutely stunning I will recommend fitting a visit while on Seoul.We went on a Sunday and loads of Koreans and even more tourists were dressing up with the traditional Hanok which made the palace and it’s surroundings have an even more special feeling.Need to buy ticket at the counter but costs only around £3.Must do to visit the building with the lake for amazing shots.
289,4.0,We did not realize the scale of this palace complex. The most interesting part was the Koreans (and likely tourists) that dress up in traditional costumes to visit the Palace. This certainly adds to the effect and sense of history.
290,4.0,"This palace site is REALLY big and even on our guided tour we probably only saw about half of it.Hard to tell what is original and what is rebuilt - take that as a criticism or a compliment, it works both ways.The changing of the guard was colourful and loud and looked pretty professional. Lots and lots of schoolkids made it a bit manic at timesNeeded lots more insitu explanation boards and direction signs"
291,4.0,"Palace is beautiful but disappointed that it didn’t have clear directions.I wish the buildings were labeled with a numbering system (and a starting point) and a more detailed explanation of each structure. Info pamphlet, 500 won, was in very small font and difficult to  read. Also, it would be nice if the cleaning staff can clean and quietly during non-tour hours. They were yelling at each other inside the structures with the tourists looking on. We were at the Nijo Castle in Kyoto just couple of days prior to this visit. Plenty of explanations and quiet working staff in uniform. Also, it was disappointing to see sub-par restorations (for some parts) to a national treasure."
292,4.0,"We went to see the changing of the guard at 9:00 a.m.  Very nice presentation, with dozens of elaborately, historically dressed soldiers. The Palace complex is a grand, interesting sight, but that’s about it.  As a foreign tourist who has a limited knowledge of Korea, I couldn’t quite appreciate the history by walking around looking at buildings.  Most viewing was only from the outside, except occasionally being allowed to look inside a door or window.  Nearby was the Korean National Folk Museum, which focused more on the Korean way of life, including the evolution of the clothing, cooking, farming and family upbringing."
293,4.0,"If you want a full on memorable experience here, rental a hanbok before you go.  The girls wearing them were so cute that I regretted not getting one. This place is great for photo ops and roaming around the entire place to learn about how they lived centuries ago.  It’s huge so you could spend at least 2 hours here. Not recommended on a hot summer day because you’re pretty much out out in the open. This one is larger than the UNESCO palace and better in my opinion.  If you’re visiting Seoul, Myeongdong this is highly recommended. It’s walking distance to the cute Bukchon Village where people roam around in their hanboks as well.  Great experience, I’d do it again but this time wearing a hanbok."
294,4.0,"A must see location for tourists, but once you see one Korean palace, you've seen all korean palaces."
