0,3.0,"Took the world’s first 60secs to level 118! The feeling was well, nothing much. Just abit if ears stuck. The technology in the lift is also awesome. Super high up the tower, could see the overall of Seoul. It’s beautiful"
1,4.0,The Mall is typical with boutique and restaurants with reasonable prices. Had visited the Lotte World Adventure with our DISCOVER Seoul Pass. Rode the Bungee which was so nerve wrecking! Their”Across the Dark” is not as hi-tech  and thrilling as Macau’s Batman Dark Flight. They should improve their VR.Kiddy ride were a lot.
2,4.0,"We were very excited to visit Lotte World and Lotte Mall, we got Lotte world tickets before they open to void the long lines and it worked, we were able to go to different rides without waiting for long time, definitely it is a great place to visit with kids.Lotte Mall, was the most beautiful place I ever visit!!"
3,4.0,"The entrance ticket was a bit expensive but overall the experience of the visit was really pleasant. We went during the nighttime which was nice to see the overview of Seoul with the street lights, but I think for a better experience it would be best to go during the daytime."
4,4.0,"Shopping heavens. Just about anything you want. Best of all, instant refund with your purchase.  All you need is your passport. There are also many restaurants cater to your taste. We spent at least couple of hours here. Fantastic."
5,5.0,"Excellent place to visit if you want to spend the day shopping and sightseeing. Don’t miss the Library inside, perfect for Instagram pics. We didn’t go up to the Tower but heard the view is amazing."
6,4.0,"This is one of the biggest malls I’ve been into. Maybe even a 2 day or all day event. There is an aquarium, stores (divided by male/female/children). A food court area, there are designated seating areas depending on where you purchased food from. But definitely not enough seats. We stood with our two small children staring until someone got up. There is a huge tech store. Similar to a Best Buy. We initially went here to see the Studio Ghibli store. Which was pretty small, but still super cute. And we will return to buy some more Ghibli souvenirs. This malls also has an individual Vans store. Which is nice. Because you can usually only buy those shoes at ABC mart here."
7,5.0,A very cool 555m tall skyscraper in Gangnam right next to Lotte World amusement park. The admission ticket was about 22.000 Won. Not too bad as we a free photo for every 4 ticket purchased. It's still a relatively new building. The superfast lift is lined with LCD screens that light up as we go up. Very cool and took less than a minute to the 118th floor. Once there go to the glass floor area and look down. What a great experience. Go to the 120 Floor to check out the outdoor area. You can see the whole of Seoul from up here. A great experience for the family.
8,3.0,Very crowded. You got to go thru a long line for any rides. All day pass is pricey but can’t ride enough due to long lines everywhere. You might want to pay more to get an express ticket to avoid lining.
9,5.0,"Room (88th floor) was well appointed with the expected amenities and very quiet with a great view of the city. Even the clouds couldn't dampen the mood. The staff were very kind and always super polite. There were no hiccups with the reservation, parking, or dining. The aquarium was nice for kids and the nearby shopping had all the top brands and the latest K-Pop paraphernalia. I had high expectations and they were met."
10,5.0,"Huge Mall. Shopping, Food, Entertainment, Lotte World Adventure. Many restrooms/toilets. There is Park outside with a small lake (man-made?) where we stayed for an hour to relax. Accessible by subway train."
11,5.0,"We went to find a specific store, Beanpole, and we bought some outfits there.  It's very expensive.  Customer service is unbeatable.  So many people just waiting to help you can be a bit overwhelming sometimes but it was very nice."
12,4.0,The Lotte Tower is the 8th tallest building in the world at 486m and 125 stories. (For comparison the Burj Khalifa is 228 stories--almost twice as tall!) The elevator to the top rises 118 floors in one minute. The views are great! I would shoot for off-season and I like the views best at night. This is one of those places that easily gets jammed with tourists at the wrong time. The observation deck has a glass floor and just a net over the top to catch things falling from above. (What can fall from above at this height?) It would also be tremendous to see a fireworks display from up here. New Years Eve must be wild!
13,4.0,"Next and connected to Siegniel and the Siegniel Hotel, the highest building and the highest hotel in Seoul. A huge shopping mall that also near to the theme park, suitable for families with kids. Very crowded on weekends."
14,3.0,more than 100 stories tall building ideal for seoul night scenery hunting individual and families to catch a chill drink on top
15,5.0,Go during the day there is less people..we waited in no line.  Went to the very top--where there is a bar.  Go out onto balcony...great visit--went to mall for dinner
16,5.0,"From my point of view this was one the most amazing views I’ve ever seen in my life, it’s an amazing experience descending more than 500mts into the fastest elevator over the earth."
17,5.0,To travel with the speed of light in an elevator to the 124th floor of the tower was an amazing experience. World class!!
18,5.0,The tower was a well organized interesting  place to visit. We got some discount as 2 of us had birthdays the week of our visit.Going up in the lift was quite an experience because it was so fast it made your ears pop! We went up as the sun set so had daylight views as well as night time. Standing on the glass floor was quite an experience! That was just in one area though so you didn't have to do it. We couldn't go outside as it was too windy that day.The mall is just like any modern mall anywhere in the world for me. I didn't shop so can't offer an opinion about value for money.
19,5.0,It was great to see and take photos of the actual view of the cross road beneath our feet on the glass floor at the Lotte World Tower. TIP: Use the token given and take as many photos at every photo station. You can choose to pay only for the best shots (or none if all shots turn out bad) as souvenir.
20,4.0,"Our American family of five, kids ages 10, 13 and 16, visited the Lotte Tower with a native South Korean. It was very nice to have our friend there, but his interpretation skills were really not necessary. We were not there to go shopping, but rather to have the Sky Tower experience. The cue area was empty for our morning visit, but if you had to stand in line, there are interesting things to look at while you wind yourself through the maze. The elevator is filled with tv screens and the ride up is amazing and beautiful. It stops near the very top and then visitors can take their time in visiting each of the floors, until they reach the very top, the 123rd floor, which consists of an expensive restaurant/lounge. Be sure to go on a relatively clear day, because you will be able to see for kilometers. Regardless of the weather, throughout much of the year the ""very fine dust that blows over from Eastern China"" obscures the view. We all liked the clear floor, so we could see straight down to the ground below. As an American from the suburbs it is impressive to see the hundreds and hundreds of apartment buildings that house the majority of South Korea's population. This was a very different experience from the Seoul Tower, which honestly I preferred. However, had we visited the Lotte Tower before the Seoul Tower, we would have been unimpressed because it has fewer stories, so the view wasn't quite as impressive."
21,5.0,"The tower was like hundreds of floors! The view was breathtaking. You can freely take photos even on the see through glass panel on the floor. Though it's so high, the queue for the lift was amazingly fast. There's a shop selling candies, souvenirs and even a cafe.Can say that it's kinda hot and stuffy inside. Maybe bcoz we're all wearing our down jackets... hahaha...."
22,3.0,the game here is more intended for children not teenagers or adults. the shortcomings of this amusement park are areas that are not too wide and too large for the price paid
23,5.0,Awesome place with lotsa fund things to do and shop. Good food at level 31 & observation deck at level 118.
24,2.0,We were there for 6 hours. Not even a single attraction can be visited. everywhere queue. wait 2 hours at each ride.. pathetic. Poor safety management. No restriction on crowd allowing
25,4.0,Mil Feuille and Creme Brulee is awesome. Macaron is terrific. Capuccino is also good. Located on the 1st floor at the Lotte World Mall. Easily accessible buy subway.
26,3.0,"The experience of riding the tower felt sort of like a ride at Disney, there are a lot of distractions to help pass the time while waiting in line.  The views at the top are impressive, and the glass floor gives some great photo opportunities.  Basically, though, it you have been to a tower at any other city, this is similar.  One can easily come away thinking that you might have overpaid for an attraction.  You can tell that the S Korean people (full disclosure: I'm Korean), are very proud of this architectural achievement, so that is where I put my mainframe when visiting this place."
27,3.0,It was an average visit.  Due to long que for each ride.  We end up just got into a few.  The que was quite insane.  It was so cold and a lot of the outdoor rides were closed.  We were compensated with the Christmas parade at the end of the visit.  It was something nice to end with.
28,5.0,Lotte World Tower is the tallest building in Korea and fifth tallest in the world.  The view from the top floor observatory is amazing where you can see the entire Seoul in a clear day.  There is a world class shopping center at the bottom where you can find all kinda of food in the world — this is a must visit when in Seoul Korea!!!!
29,4.0,"Having read some reviews and recommendations, decided to come here for the sunset.  We booked the tickets for the time slot of 1630-1700 hours of entry. There is no limit in terms of duration of stay at the top of the tower.  This gave us the opportunity to view the city before the sunset, and during the sunset at about 17:18, and then to take in the views of the city covered with lights when it is dark. There is a family discounted price for 2 adults and 2 children, the tickets totalled 87,000 won, as compared to buying them individually at 27,000 won for each adult.If you have visited the Lotte Aquarium, the ticket stub will also provide you with some discount on individual tickets (discount does not apply to the already discounted family package).There is also some discounts for senior citizen, do ask the counter staff at ticketing booth before paying.This is well worth the visit as you get to see the city of Seoul for 360 degrees and this is the sixth tallest tower in the world with a height of 500 metres."
30,4.0,The mall is big and spacious. You can find many branded store and restaurant here. There's a lotte mart inside the mall as well. Where you can stock up your snack while visiting to Lotte World Theme Park.
31,5.0,"We went up at sunset which was the perfect time as you have to book a slot which is available each half hour. Once you are up you can stay as long as you want though, so we went up before the sun set to see the city in the daylight and then we watched the sunset and saw the city lights. There are multiple floors when you get up: one with a glass floor and another with an outdoor area, so there is lots to see and from different viewpoints. It was extremely well organized and staff very professional and polite. The view was incredible, you can see for very far over the city and the river. Just make sure to go on a clear day. They have a sign in the ticket area about the day's viewing conditions to pick a good time for seeing the best. Would highly recommend."
32,5.0,Great place for shopping with lots of brand. Coming during sale season for many great deals and products
33,5.0,"I really love this place. The building is amazing and not too crowded. Price is reasonable, especially because I got the family discount. Anybody who visit Seoul should visit this place."
34,2.0,Mall was a disappointment. Especially Avenue and duty free. Aquarium was average. Not much to see inside.
35,5.0,Look at Seoul in a very special way. 120 floors above the ground give you a stunning view of the whole city. But the price is a rather expensive and there’s quite a bit of waiting time around 30 minutes or so on weekends and holidays.
36,5.0,Go here for some good shopping and certainly has great AC as it was very hot there in August. THe Signiel Hotel in the Tower is the best hotel in Korea
37,5.0,This place is really cool. You have to try the food market. I have never seen anything like it before. I also bought cosmetics. Everything you need at your finger tips.
38,4.0,"Lotte World tower provides amazing views, especially at night that are worth the visit alone and it's very well connected to the Metro. Little bit expensive but a great experience."
39,4.0,Bit out of Seoul city. Good amuzement park for little ones. Must visit place is the tower. You can get a good view.
40,4.0,"Lotte World Tower or ""Seoul Sky"" is much like other observation deck experiences. As you buy your tickets you can check what the weather and visibility is like. Prices were reasonable. Got a 9000kw discount as it was my birthday month (need to prove with passport). There is security screens, a bit of queuing  and photos to be taken before you get to the elevator. But having been to other Observation Towers, this is not unusual. The fancy super video screens were though. The price of the photos was very good!! Up the top there's a few levels. One allows you to go outside, and another has the glass floor to test your brain (I struggle to step out into the glass floor). One level had a video to show what old Korea looked like compared to now which was interesting. We checked out the top most observation deck, where you had to purchase food or drink to attend, but it was 27000kw for a chicken sandwich so we passed. It was the first time we had seen really inflated prices so we were shocked. But overall it was a good experience. Only a must see if you like seeing the sprawling city.Back on the ground floor in the mall was s really nice restaurant that had Italian food - pizza, pasta and a lamb salad that was to die for!! But I know, you don't go to Korea for Italian food but when you're with a bunch of ex-pats they are hanging for a taste of what they miss from home!! and pizza and salad are hard to find!!"
41,5.0,I visited with my 25 year old and 16 year old son a couple days after visiting N Tower.  I think Lotte World Tower was a nicer (maybe because it is newer) visit. I have recommended this to my friends who travel in Korea.
42,5.0,"We wandered into this place quite accidentally. After going to the Lotte mall, my 11 year old son suggested we go to the top of the tower and see the whole city. We went and asked the security man and were introduced to Seoul Sky.A very interesting lift ride with distraction videos on its walls took us to 117th floor. From here there are escalators to the higher floors. On 118th floor, there is a glass floor observatory where the brave can stand and the timid can take photos anyway. Can be quite scary but I lay on my back instead of standing and took some selfies showing the streets below.On every level you can take photos of Seoul. For example the Han river and Olympic Park. There is a place for photos which you buy or you can take your own.There are also souvenir shops and I think there was a small cafe. Then back to the lift and down to the mall. It was an awesome experience despite some cloudiness."
43,5.0,"You might be curious about visiting the Lotte World Tower, and rightfully so. It's the 5th-tallest building in the world, but many don't realize it has the third-highest observation deck on the planet! This is a rare structure in which your head will surpass 500m above the ground, something that wasn't even possible until the past decade.One level features a glass floor, for those who are daring enough to walk out, and two small outdoor decks with protective netting if you want to smell the air up there. They offer plenty of souvenirs and even a tiny bit of food. But don't bank on having dinner up there. Much like the World Trade Center in New York, you're treated to a visual montage on the elevator ride up so you can appreciate the evolution of the surrounding city.And while you're here, you might as well go below ground to the insanely massive mall with endless stores and excellent dining options. Eventually, you find yourself at an aquarium and an ice rink. I mean this tower and mall literally have everything you could ever imagine!"
44,5.0,"This absolutely surpassed my expectations.  The mall is just like all the other 10,000 malls in Seoul.  The tower is just amazing.  It has a glass floor that hangs over the side of the building.  It is a very cool experience.  There are two sides where you can step out over the glass ledge, and there is an outdoor observation area too.  That was pretty cool.The views are just amazing.  It is hard to even describe how amazing the views are.  Very impressive.  There are several coffee shops, candy stores and a gift shop.  Those are fine.  If you don't do this, I promise you are missing out!"
45,5.0,"This is definitely a must see location.  You have to get down, in the basement that is, to go up, up up!  From the amazing plasma displays, the architectural history, to the phenomenal views this place is worth the trip.  We spent about 2 hours peering out of Seoul Sky and then a few more in the mall.  In Seoul Sky there are a few cafes, a gift shop and a restaurant.  The views are spectacular.  It is worth the 27000 won for adults.  Lotte Tower does not allow you to make online reservations with foreign credit cards.  So get there early.  Cheers!"
46,5.0,The Lotte World Tower has a wonderful observation deck st the top of what is the 5th tallest building in the world. Avoid weekends to avoid long lines. Try to go on a weekday afternoon when the sky is clear.  Very fast elevator to the top and incredible views of Seoul
47,5.0,"5the tallest building in the world. Just opened earlier this year. If you are in the Jamsil area on a clear date, make a trip to the top. We paid about $26 for adults and $23 for 15 and younger. It claims to have he fastest elevator in the world. It’s also a double decker elevator. Views up top are truly spectacular."
48,2.0,"One of the best places in seoulThe tower is the fifth tallest building in the worldThe mall is good and containing some international restaurantsVariety of shops international and Korean Luxury shopping ( LV , Dior ext.)International shops ( guess , Nike . . Ext)The metro station ( jamsil ) is in the B1 store , which takes you directly to the mallThere is also Lotte mart , which is a supermarket if you would like to grab some fresh food ( fruits , veges )"
49,4.0,The mall is located in a upscale area so with that comes upscale prices. Modern designed and clean mall with many artistic displays. Luxury designer brands line the first 2 to 3 floors.Dining options are located on the basement level with some play areas and shops for kids.  This place is a shoppers paradise but if shopping is not really your thing it can been browsed quickly or even skipped without feeling like you missed much.
50,4.0,The fees for the Seoul Sky was quite expensive but at least the scenery is worth it. Glass floor panel was interesting.
51,1.0,"Like most places in fashion district, the shopping in over-rated. Don't expect to find fashion cheap like in Taipei or Hong Kong, the prices are close to what you will get in the USA or online order directly from Seoul. If you are not tiny and thin, you probably won't find clothes fit you."
52,3.0,We were accidentally visiting this mall on our way to Lotte World. Lotte World Mall is a high end mall. This mall has so many expensive brands. It's a nice place to do window shopping. Its location is in front of Lotte Department Store Jamsil (Lotte World is inside this Lotte Dept Store. The unique thing in this mall is all the escalators operate after 10.30.
53,3.0,Mostly high end shops so it's a good place if you like window shopping or have ALOT of money.  We did find Krispy Kreme donuts!
54,5.0,"The elevator ride itself is worth the price of admission. There are five floors for your viewing pleasure. I think the third observation floor (120th floor) has a clear floor that sticks out over the city street below.There is a cafe, professional photographers and a gift shop among other things. It is real easy to burn through several hours up there even with an overcast day!"
55,5.0,"We visited the Lotte Tower on an overcast day, but it was still enjoyable. There is a lot to look at on the way up and plenty of space to view once you get to the observation areas. There is even a glass floor section to enjoy! There is a cafe or two, a restaurant, and gift shops. If you are a military family, they offer a military discount. The mall is divided into several sections! One section has many restaurants with cuisines from around the world.There are high and low-end stores, novelty shops, dessert shops. The other section of the mall has many restaurants that are familiar to Americans: On the Border, Hard Rock Cafe, P.F. Changs, Califonia Pizza, Krispy Cream. There are several other restaurants that offer a variety of choices! There is a beauty section, plenty of sweets, children's clothing, a caricature booth, and an amazing movie theater! It is huge! They offer 4DX movies there and you can select your seat before going in. They also have some interesting snacks to select from at the concession stands. Military discount is available! Jamsil station connects the subway directly to the mall! it is so convenient!"
56,5.0,"Enjoy it very much. Too large to cover all areas,It is advisable to buy the Magic Pass, because eventhough we went there on weekdays but there were so many people and some attractions, we had to queue for 1 hour"
57,3.0,"Frankly, i don't really think it is that wonderful. Observatory deck - Been to a few other observatory decks in Japan and Dubai, Lotte World observatory deck is on the average side. The only memorable thing i remember is the glass panel on the floor. Lotte World Mall - the first 4 levels are all the branded stuff and only B1 house more affordable brands. Nothing much.Although i must say, they have tons of eatery places here so surely you can find something that suits your taste."
58,5.0,"right in Jamsil, beautiful shopping mall with gold on everything. Noticed that the reception ladies are all gorgeous!"
59,5.0,"Visitors only can access to a few floors for free. If you want to go to the top floor, you need to buy an expensive ticket."
60,5.0,"The tower is located near Jamsil station, and you don't need to actually exit the station precinct to enter the tower.It should take you around 40 minutes from the Myeong-Dong area.Once you buy the ticket and go through the turnstiles, it will take you around twenty minutes to reach the top floor. The entire process is orderly, but takes time, and that can be a bit boring.On the top floor, the views are stunning. Having visited Tōkyō Sky Tree, Sydney Tower, Gold Coast Q1, Auckland Tower, and Tsūtenkaku in Osaka, this place offers good value. The tickets are reasonable and the place looks brand new."
61,3.0,I went there to go up in the tower. I was very desapointed because it was close and no one could give me exact information about when it would open. The Mall it's incredible like so many in Seoul.
62,5.0,It is a great place to go with details since you enter. Don't miss the short film at the beginning of your experience.  Sit down and enjoy all the monuments the film shows. It also has a tree that shows the different seasons in Korea. It is a very visual experience since the start. Fully recommended.
63,5.0,We spent 3 hours plus at the observatory deck to appreciate the beautiful sun-set view. The elevator ride to the observatory deck was interesting similar to taking a chilling ride. It took only less than a minute to reach the top (level 115). The city view of Seoul was not fantastic but can view a nice sun-set on a great sunny day.
64,4.0,"the review is for only the tower.  we stayed at Lotte hotel and best part of it was, we got tix from the hotel.  We didn't have to wait in line and went straight up b/c we got the tix from the hotel.  That was GREAT !!!  It takes a min to get to 110 floor.  You can go to the cafe or to the restaurant.  Otherwise, it's just looking at the view.  I enjoyed it and would say, set aside 30-45min.  There's a line to get down but it went fast around late afternoon.  They don't let you take a stroller, they keep it downstairs for you."
65,4.0,"Basically similar with other high end malls in other cities. The tower will give you the sight of Seoul City.As a muslim traveller, the muslim praying room is one the best I’ve been to in a non muslim country... halal food is tricky as a lot of retail use pork and seafood restaurants are very expensive options. Thankfully we found Poke Bowl in the food court near the theme park entrance."
66,5.0,"We enjoyed the place, it offers information regarding the tower and some historical information. Nice show in the elevator. At the top there are a great view, great souvenirs shops, coffee shop and restaurant. And glass floor view for the braves. The mall is huge with great shopping experience."
67,5.0,"Yes, I would rate this as my first choice of favorite super towers, and I've seen a lot of them around the world.  Mainly I am impressed with the design and technology along with the great variety of things to do in this tower.  It just opened a few months ago and at 123 floors above ground and 6 floors below ground (parking), it contains practically everything you would ever want.  Plan on going VERY EARLY at opening and spend all day.  We were there for 2 days.  The observation decks are on the top 5 floors (117-123), a hotel from about the 75th to about the 100th floor, residences around the 42nd to 70th floor, and private offices higher up.  At 1,800 feet tall, you better not have a fear of heights to visit.  Also, this place is very crowded.  Furthermore, there is an aquarium, movie theatre, more shops than you can visit in a day, and places to eat although later in the afternoon and evening, it is practically impossible to get anything to eat without waiting a VERY LONG TIME.  I this there is approximately 3 million square feet in this mega structure.  It can be seen from anywhere in Seoul and one of the top 5 tallest in the world as they claimed. As expected, there is security to get into the building, but not a big deal.The roughly $50 US dollar cost to express up to the observation decks is much too expensive in our opinion, yet worth it for a one time experience.  The transparent floors (some people say glass floors) on the observation deck is incredible.  Some people were to scared to stand on them.  The elevator to get up there is large, fast, and unique with video displays and high tech.  It's the most unusual elevator I've ever seen.  Going back done after being up on the observation decks for almost an hour, the staff couldn't manage getting the large number of people in the elevator.  Lots of people packed in there with people touching us on all sides.  Fortunately it is about only a minute up and down.  Ears popping due to the fast speed, yet smooth ride so you don't sense how fast it is moving.If you come later in the day you will regret being lazy as the lines for mostly anything are long;  tickets, elevators, restaurants, etc.If you are going for the tower and the view, choose a good clear day.  One couple told me they were there the prior day and disappointed that they were in the clouds and saw nothing after paying 50,000 Korean Won.  I mentioned did they consider standing on the ground and looking up to see if the top of the tower is visible before buying the ticket?  If you can't see it when looking up, then you won't see anything when you get up there. No common sense with those folks. If you are not interested in the tower, you can spend a whole day just shopping or looking around at all the unique sculptures, art, and shops (some affordable and some are high end expensive items).  My rating does not include the fact that in my opinion, this place is not really for elderly people or folks with strollers and wheel chairs as it is much too crowded and no place to sit or rest.If you go to Seoul and don't visit, then you will miss out on a great experience."
68,5.0,I must say this has got to be one of the best towers that I have visited. Its not the typical tower that you see when you visit a city which is usually one floor. Here they have 3 floors with the 20thF being the best because of the glass bottom floor and the open balcony. Aside from having a fantastic view of the city you can instantly post your pics as there wifi is really strong considering how high we were. Really worth the visit
69,5.0,"I went with my family in weekday...fantastic because it was not crowded The price is ₩27.000 about US$ 24The best views in Seoul, we choose a clear day. Ideal to go in the afternoon to wait for the sunset and to take good photos.  You can go up to a floor and then you have several floors to see and even 2 outdoor terracesIts a cafeteria and a nice shop where we bought a magnet!!Then when you go down I recommend to eat at the Mall, you have several options and for example ""On tge Border"", ""Pizza and Pasta"" or ""Hard Rock"""
70,5.0,The tower was interesting to visit. We had coffee on the 123rd floor (rather expensive but basically lying for the view). The glass floor was cool. Overall I'd say the 5th tallest building in the world is definitely worth a visit.
71,4.0,It offers good view of Seoul when it's good weather.Fastest elevator in the world.The pride of Seoul.Definitely it was good experience.
72,2.0,Super nice mall but seems all the doors are not wheelchair and stroller friendly. We have baby stroller and needed two of us to enter and leave to hold doors. Heard rumors from rich folks that this mall doesn't want handicap people to come! Go check out starfield Mall at goyang they have wide auto doors and western style mall.
73,5.0,We bought timed tix to see the sunset on the observation deck. Then we were able to walk around the Mall and mart and have dinner before. The way to the elevator is very cool and the elevator itself too. The observation deck is fun and the view is really great. It was not too crowded when we went since there are actually several floors to take in the view.
74,5.0,"The views are spectacular and with over four floors of observation area, there are plenty of different ways to overlook Seoul, including a glass walk and outdoor terrace. They offer a professional service which is reasonably priced and includes digital access (via download on computer or smartphone) with the purchase of any print. We went with our son who was two years old (children under 3 are free); he enjoyed looking out and walking around the observation area. We would highly recommend this attraction to anyone visiting Seoul."
