0,5.0,"Love coming here to watch Seoul FC play. It's super easy to get tickets - just come 30 mins before and get them from the ticket booth. Stadium is huge, with so many empty seats - not to worry! Seats aren't allocated, so you can choose where to sit. I only like to sit behind the goal, to get involved with the songs and fans.To be honest, the quality of football is often pretty poor, but it's still super fun. The attendance was around 15,000 last match, which feels like less because of all the empty seats, but if you're in the section where everyone is singing it's great anyway. Such a novelty to bring as much booze and food into the stands as you like - 'aint like that in England!Anyway, good times. If you're in Seoul for a while, and like football then definitely worth it. Well easy to get to and cheap enough (14,000 Ïõê). Up the Seoul!"
1,4.0,Very interesting place to visit especially Faentasium has interesting stuff that if you're a fan of football you gonna enjoy it
2,3.0,"The massive majestic world cup stadium is impressive and fit for purpose for this day and age for major football matches, concerts, etc. However if you are planning to watch FC Seoul then I would probably tell you to support the away team. The stadium is rarely full to capacity which is surprising considering the population in Seoul, but the worst thing apart from the team is the supporters. I hate vuvuzelas ever since they where introduced to the football world at the South African World Cup, but also the FC Seoul fans don't seem very interested spending a lot of time on their phones and also they have a cheerleader stand where the fan seats are. Not the kind of things i enjoy at a football match but they do have a very nice fan cafe and shop and the food and drink is very good including the massive pizzas you can get and the beer. The world cup stadium is also very easy to get to using the subway as there is a subway station named after it. Overall it's good to experience it but I wouldn't want to be a FC Seoul fan."
3,5.0,There was a gate left open as we walked round so did our own tour. Security was really loose. We even got onto the pitch
4,5.0,"Nice stadium. I went for a Seoul-Incheon game. VIP at the booth was just 35,000 KRW with free beer and popcorn during the game. Fans were very passionate. Good experience"
5,3.0,This was the venue for the 2002 Korea-Japan World Cup. There was nothing on when we visited and the museum was empty and interactive videos were not available. The stadium is certainly well cared for and very clean but it was not really worth visiting.
6,3.0,"Went there during the week at night to watch FC Seoul in a AFC champions League game. Ticket prices are very reasonable as my friend and I only paid $12.00 USD (14,000 Won) and we sat very close to the pitch. Lines are long to get food or beer but plenty of vendors and restrooms. Make sure not to walk into the World Cup mall when looking for the entrance to buy tickets. Use stairs not the rotunda."
7,3.0,"As an amid football (soccer) fan, I have been watching lots of football matches, but I gotta say K-League was not that attractive. When I watched FC Seoul vs Daejeon Citizen here, I saw the difference between a team from a big city and small city, it was like watching a Manchester United vs QPR. However, the stadium was alright as I went there with a friend who was serving the Korean Forces at that time. The environment seemed poor as there was around only 5000 people on attendance.If you would to see a game here, make sure you have a Korean friend who can arrange tickets for you as the system of purchase may be a little bit complex."
8,2.0,"We thought it was a good idea to explore the famous World Cup Stadium while we are in Seoul. The stadium is very accessible via the World Cup Stadium subway station. There is not much to see, however. In such a stadium, you may expect to see a small shop that sells relevant souvenir items. It does not exist here. Instead there is a large department store / supermarket that sell everything and I guess that why people come here."
9,4.0,We passed by Seoul World Cup Stadium on our way to Sky Park and the Stadium was big and it was where World Cup was held in 2002.
10,3.0,"We walked a flight of stairs to check out the stadium from outside, nothing much to see. Theres sports shops in the stadium which u can go in. Thats all"
11,4.0,"Enjoyed the excellent stadium and the location. The football was good, and the work rate of a Korean team is phenomenal. Seoul FC make an interesting team, but I sometimes feel as though the crowd response is a little too orchestrated....but this is a Confucian society."
12,4.0,"I feel soccer fans would have a better appreciation for this stadium. Although not necessarily a tourist attraction, it is nice to see and go watch a game. Well maintained with easy access from subway.  Has a CGV movie theater, a Homeplus shopping center, and a KFC. Situated nicely around mountains as well."
13,5.0,"First off, I'm not a big soccer fan and I don't really understand the entire game.  That being said, while on vacation to Korea my brother-in-law took me to my first ever in person soccer game at the Seoul World Cup Stadium.  The facility is huge!!!  Parking was a little difficult and I think he said they charged a higher parking fee for attending a sporting event than other things offered at the stadium (a little more on that later).  The stadium is an open top facility.  If you go to a match during the day, take some sunblock.  You are allowed to bring in food and drinks, so, pack what you like.  I must admit I did enjoy watching live soccer.  It is much better than on television.  It made me want to learn more about the game.  Now for the more...The stadium has a lot more than just a field for soccer.  I also saw available shopping, a wedding hall, and a theater.  There may even be more than that but those are the extras I noticed.I did not visit the shopping area but my wife did.  She said it had a lot to offer.I did notice (accessable from the stadium) a Korean-style open market and supermarket (called a mart) across from the stadium.  I did walk through that a couple of times while out doing fitness walking on the Hangang Park trails (I have a review on that too).  The open market and mart had a lot to offer and just about any food item you may want.I did go to the movie theater twice.  The theater offers 2D, 3D, IMAX, and 4D.  I did a 2D and 4D movie while there.  The 4D experience was my first time and I thought it was pretty awesome.  The movie was Tom Cruise's ""Edge of Tomorrow.""  Since there was a lot of ""action"" in this movie, the 4D experience was quite good.  Rgular movie tickets were on par with US prices.  Since I've never been to a 4D movie in the US, I don't know the rate.  My 4D ticket was $18 US but that was the weekend price.  Ticket prices are more on the weekends at this theater.  Food items are not totally the same as the US but the prices are just as expensive for the same types of items.  So, if you're planning a trip to a soccer match and the weather doesn't fully cooperate, there is more that you can do so the day is not a total waste.  I enjoyed everything I did while there."
14,3.0,"Part of this stadium complex was some kind of shopping mall and cinema. So, a lot of locals still go there during the weekends and holiday. The entrance to that stadium was affordable. There is nothing much anyway inside of course (its just a stadium), just to snap some pictures. The exhibition room was indeed very informative and inspiring. I truly enjoyed the exhibition room."
