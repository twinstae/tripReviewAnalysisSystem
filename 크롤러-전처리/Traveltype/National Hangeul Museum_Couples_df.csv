0,4.0,"The National Hanguel Museum is situated a short walk from the National Museum of Korea, (Ichon station on Line 4 - blue - on the metro) just walk through the Pagoda Garden, following the brown, tourist signs and you can’t miss it.  Steep steps lead up to a glass fronted entrance, but there is an escalator provided and I would be very surprised if there were not a lift for those with more severe mobility challenges.I was keen to visit this museum, as I have been trying hard to learn to speak, write and read Korean.  With this trip to Korea, we gained a beautiful Korean daughter-in-law, so the need to make some progress with my learning has stepped up a notch.Developed under scientific principles in the 15th century and really taking off in the 20th century, Hanguel (often spelt Hangul in Europe) is based on 28 characters - 17 consonants and 11 vowels.  It is actually an extremely logical language and relatively simple to read, which was the intention of the king who developed it, to extend the accessibility of language to as many people as possible.My proficiency is still not sufficient to be able to fully engage with all the exhibits, but I thoroughly enjoyed the museum, particularly the video presentation  on a curved wall in the main exhibition hall, which explained in a very clear manner, with English subtitles, the construction of he language.  This video, above anything else in the museum, certainly helped a lot of things click into place in my understanding of Hanguel.There are basic museum guides available in English and there is also a programme of guided tours conducted in English - all free - the times of which are displayed on a stand by tthe he entrance to the first hall or, alternatively, ask at the information desk by the front door.On the upper floor there is a Children’s Section and a hall for special exhibitions, in addition to a further hall which, when we visited, was showing an exhibition of the History of Korean Dictionaries.There are toilet facilities on each floor, water dispensers, plenty of seating and access by either stairs, escalator or lift.  Lockers to store bags and other items are provided.On the first floor of the museum there is a pleasant cafe and small shop, which in some respects mirrors the shops at the National Museum, but also has some products focusing on Hanguel.As a non Korean speaker, one probably wouldn’t spend much more than an hour here but, if combined with a visit to the Nearby National Museum, it gives one a good perspective on the country, it’s history and language."
1,4.0,"The development of the Hangeul writing system is very interesting, and if you're interested in learning Korean or linguistic history, this museum is for you! And even better, it is free! The National Hangeul Museum provides an overview of the history behind the creation of the modern Korean alphabet during the Joseon Dynasty, covering the rationale and cultural / political context, linguistic structure and evolution of the character system up to present day. As non-Korean speakers, there was plenty of text in English, along with many interactive games and audio-visual displays highlighting elements and nuances of Hangeul. You can learn the different characters and their pronunciation, along with how to write simple words as well. We spent a little over an hour visiting this museum. There is also a whole section for young children, (mostly in Korean, but for the little kids who are 2 to 5 it does not really matter anyway) with blocks in the shapes of letters and other language-based toys and spaces they can explore. This would be a great place to go as a family. My wife and I went at the beginning of our stay in South Korea, and it gave us an appreciation and context for the language's history as we continued our travels throughout the country."
2,2.0,"The National Hangeul Museum is just next door to the National Museum of Korea.  There is no admission fee.The whole exhibit of the museum is dedicated to the development of the Korean language.  It definitely has a special meaning to the Korean people.  However, there is not a single word of English to describe anything so that we could also appreciate the exhibit or to have some clue of how the language was developed in the 14th century."
3,5.0,At first I was a bit skeptical about going here but my friend was really keen on going so we went. I must admit I was really surprised about how well everything was presented and the tour guide was really helpful. They run free tours so check out the times
