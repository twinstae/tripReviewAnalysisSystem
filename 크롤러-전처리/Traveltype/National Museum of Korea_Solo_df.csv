0,5.0,"This museum is a must visit if you are a history nerd, or you're just interested in learning about our past and ancestors. It is not only about Korea as the 3rd floor is the 'world' history section where if includes historical facts and artifacts from India, rest of Asia, Egypt and Japan. Be prepared to walk a lot. There's water dispenser at every level so you can bring your bottle for refill."
1,5.0,"You can divide museums into great, and not great.  The great museums then can be divided into worth a return visit, and not worth one.  The National Museum of Korea is a great museum that is unquestionably worth return visits.First the architecture: a large building divided into smaller units (i.e. children’s museum, library, exhibition hall).  The exhibition hall has both permanent and special exhibitions.  I only had time (almost three hours) to see the permanent exhibitions on the third and second floors, but didn’t see the first floor or the special exhibition. Regretfully I left my visit to this museum for my last day in Seoul.The exhibitions themselves are of the highest quality, using, among others, collections that were donated or bequeathed to the museum.Physically the exhibition halls are impressive, massively large with high ceilings. The explanatory text is interesting and fully translated to English.There are a few places to eat.  I can only comment on the tea room on the third floor where I had an amazingly good cup of tea.  There is also an extensive museum shop which is itself impressive. I left some money there, and would have left much more had I lived in Korea and not had to take fragile things on several flights."
2,5.0,"The main building offerred free admission but don't miss special exhibitions at the library building (with extra fee which was worth the visit). I felt obliged as it was great enough to spend some money to support it. So, I bought some souvenir from the museum shop :) Easy to go there, just take a train to Ichon Station."
3,5.0,So impressive how the museum is organised - you almost feel how it was like to live in ancient times.  Need at least a day to do it justice......
4,5.0,"I'm truly surprised by the number of museums and galleries in Seoul. The National Museum of Korea is a gem and a must see.  The building is large an spacious with exhibited being well laid out. I've only managed to see less than 30% before it closed. I will be back again. I loved how they present history and culture. Korea, whilst smaller than China, is in her own right a very sophisticated country and unique in many ways. The gift shop is the best and biggest I've seen for a museum."
5,4.0,nice museum with interesting historical exhibits.. nice to visit and learn about the past of this culture but also because of the cultural open air events
6,4.0,"If, like myself  you are not a great lover of large rambling 19th Century Museums, crammed with thousands of artefacts over umpteen floors and galleries , this is one for you!It's modern, it's light, it's airy and is just one long building with just 3 levels with a very ""constrained"" number of exhibits covering some quite precise subject areas. Entrance to the main collection is free.A little word of warning, in busy times the galleries are quite manageable, but don't be tempted to try the food hall!"
7,5.0,"I'm not sure if it's free for everyone, but it was free for us as part of the tour and it was a decent hour or so we spent in there. Very interesting to learn about the creation of the Korean writing system and more about Korean history that I didn't know. Useful going into my PhD in East Asian Studies."
8,5.0,If time allows only one museum choose this one. Its free and hours vary depending on the day of the week. Look online at the official website. Skip the guided tour. English hard to understand and 1 hour spent on 10 items. Allow 3 hours plus time for any special exhibits. Download the app and bring your earphones. Well organized so numbered exhibits correspond to numbers on the app. Exhibits in English so easy to follow. Enjoy!
9,5.0,"Visitors to Korea will love the extensive collection of Korean treasures, many of which have decent labels in English. (Something hard to find in Korea.) As a resident of Korea, I love that this museum gets special exhibits (like the ""Golden Man"" from Kazakhstan last year) and that it has a great selection of coffee and tea shops and a beautiful sitting area on the second floor. It's a spacious, beautiful museum and a world-class collection--for free!"
10,4.0,It's a 40 minutes ride on the subway south from Insadong including a 10 minute underground walk from the stop to the main entrance. The vast building is impressive with great views of the Seoul Tower. The collections inside are excellent and well laid out.
11,4.0,"I took an early morning subway ride to this place knowing that the Museum has an expansive grounds to stroll.  Arrived 9AM and had a leisurely stroll around.  Note that there are people jogging and they have small trails winding around pagodas and meditation nooks.  It was so peaceful without the crowd and by noon it was already hot.  The museum entrance is free and they have two special exhibits.  The exhibits costs KW7500 and for people who has not much interest on it, I recommend you pass.  The main museum artifacts are more than enough for a short visit (approx. 1 hr).  There is a convenience store open prior to 10AM and I saw two restaurants that were still close when I left the grounds.  I suggest coming early to avoid bus loads of kids visiting the museum."
12,2.0,"Possitives : N o doubt the museum's contemporary architecture is both modern and impressive and is set in very attractive gardens. The facilities are very adequate, there is free entry and the staff are pleasant and helpful.  Negative: For such a modern, national museum....Boy, it was so tediously boring. Old school type of exhibition...just dated exhibits and artifacts in glass cabinets. No interactive fun here or anything to fuel the imagination . I fell asleep on my feet my the second floor. I should imagine incredibly boring for children ."
13,5.0,"The museum is easily accessibly via the Seoul Metro. The grounds are beautiful with several restaurants and many places to sit and relax. There was no admission charge but there were charges for some special exhibits.This is a large museum and is well laid out with exhibits down the side of the main hallway on each floor. There is just too much to go into extreme detail but there is coverage of Indian, Chinese and Korean history and artifacts; all well presented and explained with many explanations in English for those like myself that had trouble with Hangul.My favourite was probably the ancient shipwreck exhibit which showed many artifacts.There were several souvenir shops. The restaurant Was very good. Reasonable price for a museum restaurant; the Bibimap (meat and vegetables mixed up with rice) was quite tasty.definitely worth a visit."
14,5.0,"This was a great, free, way to spend a few hours while in Seoul. Easy access from the subway. Lot of good information and most descriptions on items/exhibitions are also in English, which was super nice. Plenty of places to rest inside and also had food options. Overall, great place to visit."
15,5.0,When you stay in South Korea you need to visit this museum... it is really interesting and you will be satisfied for what you paid
16,5.0,"This might be one to split into a few visits, as it's overwhelmingly large. Pick a few areas which strike you and dive in, then enjoy what's nearby."
17,2.0,"The museum is in a wonderful modern complex with a huge building housing some artefacts from various ages. I’ll be honest, I like a museum  but this one didn’t do it for me. I felt they struggled to fill it and what they had was interesting but nothing special."
18,4.0,The cultural diversity and different sections in there that cover a variety of Asian countries are quite unique.
19,4.0,"It was also free, at least the day I went. The interior of the building alone is worth a visit, and then it’s the home of a wonderful collection."
20,5.0,Sign up for a tour to get the most out of your visit. I visited the museum several times so see new exhibits. It's worthwhile.
21,5.0,"The museum is very big, full of interesting things. It's architecture is spectacular. There are tours in many languages and a lot of English explanations. The admission is free but some exhibits are charged. This is the place if you want to learn more about Korean history."
22,4.0,"If you want to understand the history of Korea, this is the place to be. It is the largest museum in Korea which houses precious Korean cultural assets. You will learn the history of Korea from ancient times to the modern era. To get here, just go down at Ichon Subway station, exit 2. The subway is connected to the museum via underpass."
23,5.0,"The museum is very complete and modern, the exhibits in the first floor where specially appealing to me since I love history it shows a very detailed history of korea from prehistory to the modern times.  The museum is small and may not have a whole lot of pieces in display, but mind you that for a country that has been looted and pillaged various times through the centuries, the museum collections gives a very complete image of the korean nation, highly recommend if you have the time"
24,4.0,"Im gonna start of by saying that these sorts of museums are often not something I enjoy that much.With that said, I did not think the content of the exhibitions were that interesting. There was definitely some cool things on display. But also, it felt for me like 50% was different pots and porcelain. Which some might find interesting, but quickly gets incredibly dull in my opinion.But what really saves this place in my eyes is the building itself. Which is enormous and, I think, incredible both on the inside and outside with surrounding.Also, the museum is for free. So if interested, I definitely recommend going here and if you find the pots as dull as I did, atleast you will have the building to look at.Additionally, I did not take any tours. Audio nor guided, so maybe that would have enhanced the experience."
25,5.0,Easily accessible by metro.  Admission is free (unless you want to see the special exhibitions).  I went there on a Sunday so there were lots of families with kids there. Quite a wide coverage of collection of different artefacts.
26,4.0,Finally got the time to visit this one yesterday. Specifically loved the paintings gallery in 2F. Worth a visit.
27,5.0,This museum claims to be the biggest in Asia by floorspace.  It may not be true but it is certainly big.  The art displays are excellent.  There is a good restaurant.
28,4.0,The museum was a very interesting look at the development of Korea over the years. The gift shop provided very good gifts to bring home to family.
29,5.0,"It was an easy jump from Incheon and my first stop during my day-long layover. The regular exhibits are free to the public plus there is a free app that acts as a docent to lead you through the museum, to save artefacts of interest, and search must-see artefacts. There is a restaurant on the 3rd floor to avoid the busy small cafés in front.The museum is 100% wheelchair friendly, however it sits on top of a small hill. To me, it was worth the climb."
30,4.0,Located in a large open area this building houses the evolution of the Korea. Everything is organised and the building is a modern spacious place. Very interesting and would definitely recommend it.
31,5.0,"Loved this place, spent 1 whole day on the 1st floor with history of Korea and 1 day on the 2nd and 3rd floor. It is free, there's decently priced food (including a vegetarian meal) and it's just a beautiful, superclean modern building with so much well-presented information. Incredible!"
32,5.0,"I’ve been to most of the major museums in the world and this museum has the finest collection of Asian art hands down.  The focus is on Korean art but there are also strong exhibits with Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Cambodian, East Indian, Lao, Thai, Indonesian, Mongolian and Filipino art as well.  Admission is free.  If you go on a weekday in the morning you will likely encounter bus loads of school children in the museum.  So if you prefer a more quiet visit you may want to go on a weekend or in the afternoon (the kids seemed to be getting tired after around 2pm).  Guided tours are available.  I eavesdropped on a few different tours and they were extremely informative."
33,5.0,"A great way to learn Korean history. The history reveals itself before your eyes when you cover the ground floor. The art section on the first floor enhances the awe factor and very mesmerizing! The displays are well-arranged and flows very nicely in alignment with history. Right from the 3- kingdom period to the Unified Silla, Goryeo to Joseon dynasties. The section on Joseon Dynasty will leave one with wonder and intrigue: it's a one-stop destination to learn about the interlinked history of Korea, China and Japan in the early Medieval and Medieval period. It's so enlightening to know that Korea has richer and older culture compared to contemporary Japanese culture. Must visit place in Seoul!"
34,5.0,Very interesting.  Learned a lot about Korean history and its wonder people.  Great place to go and wonder around for a few hours.  Lots of historical stuff to see.
35,5.0,"This place is amazing, i went twice, each time spending 3 hours looking around and i still didn't see the whole museum. More than just a building with great artifacts you can also walk the ground that have a waterfall and genuine 1000yr old statues. Even if museums are not your thing, the view alone is worth the trip. TIP: they are open until 9 on Wednesday and you can see Namsan tower from the top of the museums steps"
36,4.0,"It is a heritage museum where you learn about the culture of South Korea, Entry is free and this is one of the best free museums I have ever visited."
37,5.0,On the way back from the DMZ spent a few hours hours here. Its free and a great place to learn all about Korea. Simply put its a great visual learning opportunity and well worth the visit
38,5.0,"For once I found myself with a day to enjoy whilst on a business trip to Seoul. Usually imy visits comprise of the traditional airport, taxi, hotel, taxi, meeting, taxi cycle.Braving the immaculate Seoul underground helpful locals and clear signage meant I arrived without misadventure. Simply look to connect with the light blue line 4 and get of at Ichon, the covered walkway is well signposted and brings you into the beautifully manicured park surrounding the impressive museum.Entry to the main museum is free, but you do have to pay a nominal amount for special exhibit halls. The ground floor is laid out chronologically with exhibits starting from from Neolithic times all the way through to the modern day. I recommend you spend some time studying the timeline mounted on the wall at the entrance, particularly if like myself, you have limited knowledge of Korean history. The exhibits are beautifully presented and most have a good English language explanation. I am not sure how long I spent wandering from era to era, probably about three hours, but I was so immersed it didn't really matter. With hindsight I should have done some background reading as my head was struggling to piece all the information together. Second floor was focussed on art and ceramics with the third floor furniture and similar. First / ground floor requires the most time.There are cafes on each floor but are limited to mainly cake and coffee. There is a food hall but it was a little too busy so I gave it a miss. Spent thirty minutes sitting in the sun before walking around the mirror lake to visit the National Hangeul Museum. This is an absolute must if you want to piece together some of what you have seen in the main museum.Great day out, free entry too and an awful lot of new knowledge to be fascinated by"
39,5.0,I loved going to museum when going to difference places. I learnt alot of news things when visiting museums. There are alot of exhibition showing in October. I remembered there was exhibition on Joseon dynasty. Very educational for my brother and I.
40,3.0,The architect of the museum is so high. I love this and try to go all the rooms. I dont realize the story of the museum.
41,5.0,If you happen to go to korea and is short on time or want to have a relaxing time be sure not to miss this place.If you need to see old tradition or you want to have a good stroll it covers all of those.Be sure to put it in your agenda when you visit Korea.
42,4.0,"Realy nice museum which will give you a lot information about Korean art and history up to app. 1910. They have a great app, which you should download before you start your tour"
43,5.0,"the Museum is free which is great for a traveller on a budget!the lay out of the museum is great and easy to follow and the exhibits are fascinating and a great insight into the history of Korea, the art collections and other great exhibits. I saw every exhibit in around 3/4 hours so it took up a good portion of my afternoon. The subway station is so close as well as having a cafe and convenience store just outside. the gift shop was a little pricey but that was to be expected."
44,5.0,"Went to The National Musuem of Korea. It is in a beautiful setting with plenty of room for everyone. There was a free concert on when I arrived, playing great jazz. The guy playing the saxophone was great. The Musuem is always worth a visit. Everything is beautifully displayed. Lovely food and iced Citron tea in the tea room. Excellent Museum shops selling a real variety and good quality merchandise."
45,5.0,"The architecture is stunning, the staff helpful, and the exhibits themselves interesting and informative.  I got the audio-guide and I spent an entire afternoon roaming through the museum.  I think those with an interest in history would certainly enjoy it.  The museum itself is very well-maintained.  This is one of the best free activities I've ever done."
46,4.0,"Great activity for hot, cold or rainy days.  This place is massive and contains a wide array of artifacts from Korea’s history.    This place does tend to get crowded, especially during the summer heat.  Getting there: Metro Line 4, Ichon was station exit 2 will take you directly into the museum.  Inexpensive snacks at the CU onsite.  I had Kimbop and water for 3,000W."
47,5.0,"The museum itself is huge, free of charge, today works till nine o'clock.It has many objects, shop, lockers, clean toilett etc."
48,5.0,"I enjoyed this Museum it was close to the Gyeongbokgung Palace, walking distance.The admission was FREE The Museum was clean and modern. History of Seoul, South Korea 🇰🇷 all the stages the country has been Thur.I enjoyed the pictures and props and videos that they had.If you enjoy history definitely come here."
49,5.0,"This museum was very well laid out with the ground floor dedicated to the history of Korea up until the early 20th century. I only had a few hours so I spent the majority of them there so didn't get a chance to see the rest of the museum, but I had a quick glimpse of the first floor which had a calligraphy and art section."
50,4.0,"The museum offers a decent download of the history of Korea, till the formation of modern Korea. Sadly you wouldn't get to see anything like the impact of World War. Alot of stuff are touch and go, but that is understandable because Seoul also hosts many other related museum such as the National Palace Museum of Korea. As an arsent museum goer, it is just a pity that this museum is not a ""one stop shop"".The key exhibits are in the first floor. The 2nd and 3rd floors houses some arts pieces of Korea and artifacts of the world respectively. I personally think that you may give these 2 upper floors a miss it time is a constraint - I can see effort in the curation, but the collection, especially on general world, is quite thin. I spent a total of 4-5 hrs in the museum. Entrance is free!"
51,5.0,"i can tell you from extensive travel experience that this museum is a work of wonder.  the architecture, organization, presentation and landscape already make it a great place to visit and adding to the fact that it showcases the best of Korea for FREE is a great way to learn and appreciate Korean history/culture"
52,5.0,"The architecture is great, the way the rooms and lighting (both natural and electric) really highlight the art.There is enough on display that everyone should find something interesting, i was delighted to see the cultural influences of surrounding countries as that aspect is often skipped.I would recommend a visit."
53,5.0,"Travelers are always looking for interesting and stuffs, and this is one of them. You will learn a lot of Korean culture and helps to understand their traditions. The only inconvenient was the restaurant, which didn´t sell me a coffee and a cake, they ask me to have a complete meal to get the service."
54,3.0,"If you got your history classes in high school (EU students), then most of the information obtained here is repetitive. Nevertheless, it does generally specify on Korea. I would recommend the war museum whocj gives the same information but more specified on their own korean history."
55,5.0,"Went on a solo trip to this place as the wife had another appointment and it was totally worth it.The outdoor areas were beautiful and well designed. The building architecture too was impressive.Going in, you do not need to pay for an entry ticket (however I believe that the special exibhitions are paid events)The first floor narrates the entire history of Korea, starting from the stone age period to the korea empire. Second and third floors belong to art and sculptures. I learnt so much from the artifacts and exibhits on display. I now have a working knowledge of Korean history. The first floor exibhits are structured in a chronological order, so if you follow the recommended route, you will not miss a part of Korean history. Only managed to complete the first level though due to time, but would love a return visit for the other floors if possible."
56,5.0,You will need one whole day maybe to enjoy this amazing museum. Also visit the museum shop. There are some nice quality things with reasonable prices.
57,5.0,"A world-class museum that has free admission and something for everyone.  The grounds themselves of this massive building are impressive enough and offer photo ops aplenty.  Once inside, I recommend renting an audio guide device at the front desk so that you can get more information on demand about any exhibits or items you find particularly interesting.  It's only 1,000 Won.There are usually concerts of some kind happening every Saturday afternoon, which I was lucky enough to catch from the upstairs balcony of the cafe on the second floor just above the stage in the entry atrium.The building itself is a bit of an architectural marvel inside and out as icing on the cake!"
58,5.0,A great place to learn about the Korean history. The English guide was very knowledgeable and I had a great time. The museum restaurant on the ground floor was lovely with great service.
59,4.0,"Since I love history, National Museum of Korea is the best place to visit, they had 3 floors and each floor describe different history. I could spend hours inside. The history also interest me."
60,5.0,"A fascinating walk throughout Korean history from ancient times to contemporary events across ample, well curated rooms. Everything is explained in both Korean and English. Plenty of rest areas and coffee shops to make it through the long hours it takes to admire the amazing variety of art, objects and information on display."
61,5.0,I spent nearly a whole day at this museum.  It is such a beautiful space.  I felt calm and meditative within it.  LOVED the special exhibition of the tiger in east Asian Art.  It is the 9th largest museum in the world and I can't wait to go back and explore it all the more.OH...and the majority of the museum is FREE.  You'll have to pay between $3 and $6 for special exhibitions.
62,4.0,I attended the museum for a free English your which was informative and enjoyable. The museum is world class and seems very new. Taught me alot about Korea and enjoyable visit.
63,4.0,"I was hoping for more history and less pots. The museum itself is massive and beautiful. I found it hard to get into despite the great job they have done with the artifacts in the museum. I did like the furniture exhibit. The rest I wasn't much impressed by besides the massive pagoda. Maybe I was just too tired to appreciate the museum, but it was worth going at night to see the view of the N Seoul Tower"
64,4.0,"I was expecting that they would have more Korean things on exhibition (or was I in the wrong museum??). Ground floor was all about the Korea, which is very informative. But the 2nd to 3rd floor, is disappointing. I don't get the connection of the items on exhibit. It's like since the pieces were donated by famous people (I get it..), so they throw all those bits and pieces together? But the interior and exterior architecture made up for the disappointment. The museum is child, elderly and Instagram friendly."
65,5.0,"This museum is free. It has around 6 exhibition halls and 50 rooms. Like in every museum that you have been this museum has permanent and special exhihibitions.  There is also a separate museum for children.  It has English,Japanese, and Chinese tours you need to check how many a day. Subway line 4 will take ypu there. Is really beautiful and has 4 floors that you will enjoy a lot, be sure to have time that day is so many little details in some of the exhibitions."
66,5.0,"The museum is huge. You can easily spend 4-5 hours there. It is a new building, very contemporary looking, with a lot of daylight coming in, escalators everywhere, marble floors - simply great. There is a plenty of restrooms, multiple coffee shops, few large museum shops, a storage place to lock your bag or coat. I wanted to get on the English guided tour, which is free, the first one after the museum opening time. I ended up being the only one on the tour. It was only me and a tour guide - call it 'a private tour' :-) The tour took around 1 hour covering a few main artifacts on the first and second floors. I enjoyed it. I also enjoyed perfectly brewed cappuccino in the coffee shop :-)5 stars, highly recommended."
67,5.0,I went on a quiet weekday and arrived in time to go on one of the free English guided tour of the museum. It was a great way to get a brief history of Korea and a sense of what the museum had to offer. There's a mix of ancient/old artifacts and art organized by the specific periods in Korea's history.
68,4.0,"Decided to explore it as part of a red bus tour since the entrance was free. Lots of beautiful pieces and it was not crowded, so you can walk around peacefully. I loved the gift shop!"
69,4.0,"I visited the museum without much expectations as I just wanted to escape the cold but boy, what a find! The museum is very modern looking with a nice square and pond surrounding it. The artifacts and layout is spot on because it was like you are walking the timeline of Korean history, from their prehistoric era to the modern days. Lots of sitting area to rest your leg. Drinking water is even available. Wifi is strong and the cafeteria serves decent enough food."
70,4.0,"The National Museum of Korea is an excellent museum. It is the largest museum in Korea. It is housed in an impressive building. Before you get to the main entrance – there are benches and leisure areas. As you enter the main lobby area is large, and spacious. The architecture is something to behold. Outside the museum is a park with a small lake. It is a beautiful setting. The museum has many exhibits that show Korea from historic times to the present day. The museum also holds many cultural activities to further the knowledge of how the museum works, and what it does to acquire items. You can take part in all the activities. There are many books that have been published; and research work to support the preservation of artifacts.   On the first floor, is the prehistoric and ancient history gallery; and medieval and early modern history gallery. On the second floor is the calligraphy and painting gallery; donations gallery with exhibits from various collectors. On the third floor is the sculpture and crafts gallery which has Buddhist sculptures, Buncheong ware and white porcelain. There is also the Asia gallery with art from Indonesia, China and Japan.  The museum gift shop is full of very nice items to buy.Opening hours are Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday – 10am to 6pmOn Wednesdays and Saturdays – 10am to 9pmOn Sundays and public holidays 10am to 7pm."
71,4.0,It is a good exhibition of the history and development of Korea. very convenient to go by subway and it is free for the permanent exhibits too.
72,5.0,"I'd definitely put this at the top of things to do in Seoul. Go here before (or instead of) the palaces. Excellent layout to the exhibitions, and done in a way that one learns a lot about Korean history. Does a good job of incorporating all aspects of life, from food to religion to political systems to agriculture, etc."
73,5.0,The National Museum is definitely worthwhile visiting since it covers many different aspects of Korean history. Artefacts from other Asian countries which influenced Korea are on display and it covers a few thousand years of history.  Àll is arranged according to different topics and timeline and it is very easy to find your way around. Several cafes invite for breaks. Multimedia equipment is available in several languages. Admission is free.Good to combine with the War Museum around the corner.
74,5.0,"This museum in absolutely huge! The best thing is that it is 100% free!The building is a giant granite stone structure and located on the right side is the Korean history side. From here you can see many things from pre-history to modern times. The best highlight for me was the huge gold crown that the emperor wore and the 10 story pagoda! There are three floors, the first floor as artifacts while the others are dedicated to statues and paintings!On the left side of the museum is the special exhibition hall where they normally have special exhibits in. You can check what is there on the official website and there is an extra charge for these exhibits. I recommend dedicating  a few hours and make sure to wear some comfortable shoes when visiting!They also have an application that you should download to your phone which is like a personal GPS audio guide for your trip!For more on the national Museum of Korea and other places in Seoul I have a like to my travel blog of Seoul in my profile."
75,4.0,"Give this place a look if you have time.  A decent look at the history of the Korean peninsula.  Special exhibits cost money, but to get in, it doesn't cost anything."
76,5.0,Stunning collection of Korean artifacts and artwork. Museum is well-organized and exhibits are varied. Great gift shop and dining options aswell
77,4.0,"Strong sea legs are required. A lot of walking involved. Close to the train station. If you like art and history, this place is great for you. A lot of excavated Korean artifacts. Probably one of the biggest Museums in Asia. Cafes and restaurants inside and around the museum. Entrance is free for the permanent exhibit. There might be a fee for their special exhibits. Check their website for more information."
78,5.0,"Basically I don't like museum, but i think this place is absolutely worth it to visit. I believe you will find something interesting inside. Besides, it's free of chargeI planned to visit the museum for just one hour but end up into 4 hrs."
79,4.0,A very big museum with more collections. I visited two of them and was pleased with the display. The permanent collection is on Korean history and shows the countries history from different aspects.The place is easily accessible with the subway.
80,5.0,"At the time of writing, the ticket price was 6000 won - certainly acceptable considering the wealth of Korean history on display.  There are a lot of ceramic pieces to view, great Buddha statues, and artifacts from other countries such as china and India. The museum is laid out so that there is no crowding around certain exhibits. It is quiet, clean, beautiful, and has food and drink on offer in the cafe.Here is the caveat to the five star rating. If you are a family with younger members and are planning to go, then unless your kids are smart and attentive, they WILL be bored at this museum. All of the children present during my visit were running around paying no attention to the exhibits, and there is nothin child friendly in the main part of the museum. Choose wisely."
81,5.0,"The museum provides daily guided tours, free of charge, in various languages (check out their website for schedule). Our guide was a middle aged man volunteering for the museum. Thanks to his passion and vivid personality he brought life to the tour, as well as the artefacts. And I would not see the hours fly by."
82,5.0,Whatever the length of your stay in Seoul but the museum is THE place to visit.... And it's free :-))
83,5.0,"The grand, marble lined, modernist building channels plenty of natural light to show off Korea's ancient treasures. It harmoniously blends traditional and contemporary styles. It is the largest museum in Korea and houses precious Korean cultural assets that tells the story of Korea's history, from ancient to The modern times. The museum is divided into two exhibition areas for the purpose of displaying relics and artifacts. Permanent exhibition includes prehistory and ancient history, medieval and early modern history,  calligraphy and arts, sculpture and arts. No entrance fee to see the permanent exhibitions, but a paid ticket is required to see any special exhibits. Take Subway Line 4 to Ichon Station Exit. 2."
84,4.0,"This place is massive and the exhibits are excellent. However, it does take a long time to see everything, so it might be a good idea to take a break or two. There is a coffee shop, as well as many resting spots with chairs. As entrance is free, one may even split a visit over a few days. Would highly recommend for a first time visit to Seoul or Korea, but for someone who has seen other museums in Korea, much of it might seem like more of the same."
85,5.0,"Timed my visit so I could take the tour, which I would heartily recommend.  The English tour began at 2 pm and Hyun provided a ""greatest hits"" version of the museum for the next 1.5 hours.  Not only did I learn about Korean history, but I left with insight into Buddhas, pagodas, and traditional pottery.  Heartily recommended."
86,5.0,"The main hall was absolutely amazing and well organized to give visitor, especially the foreign one as me, a holistic view of Korean history, arts, literature. The exhibitions led me back to thousands years ago and then gradually entering the modern history of Korea. On 3rd floor, there was a great exhibition of Asian arts which was worth to visit too. And the best thing? It was totally free :)"
87,5.0,The Museum is well organized and the place to go if you want to learn about Korean history and culture. Going through the exhibit you move in time from pre-historic to the early 20th century. On the way you will admire the beautiful golden treasures of the Shilla dynasty;
88,5.0,If you want to see traditional Korean stuff than go to this museum above everything. You will know history of Korea peninsula.
89,5.0,"Spend as much time as you can here ..it's a brilliantly designed complex with innumerable wonderful artefacts to see.Warning ..do not waste won on the audio guide . The 3000 won version sounded as if the translation into English was done and read by a robot, and the vcommentary added little to the free information given at the piece . Only a tiny fraction of what is on display is covered . I returned it after two hours, though I spent the whiole day there."
90,5.0,"This a huge museum, separated into two annexes so that two different exhibits can be curated at the same time. There is also a 'Children Museum' i guess for the young ones. And there are a few gardens too.Easily reached from Ichon train station. It is almost opposite the National Hangeul Museum. Admission fees applies."
91,4.0,"Great museum to visit and get a feel for Korean history. Lots of nice objects to see including beautiful Boeddha and Bodhisattva statues. The two big pieces in the central hall are also worth a look. Finally the also have a small southeast asian collection. Wouldn't call it a must see,  but definately worth a visit."
92,5.0,"Looks can be deceptive, there is LOTS to see, you could spend hours here but our guide took us round the main highlights which was great."
93,4.0,"Inside outside, the National museum is fill with artifacts. There is even an alley with little Shop houses they used to have in the past. It is now a props like area for photo opportunities."
94,3.0,"This is a grandiose and well organized museum. My problem is that there are not so many artifacts worth seeing. Perhaps my appreciation of historical Eastern paintings, pottery and calligraphy is not groomed enough, but I did not find many things in the collection compelling. I appreciated the building more, and that this museum is free."
95,5.0,The exterior design complemented the amazing interior with stunning galleries. Obtain a leaflet ask reception for key icons to visit. A lovely pagoda sits along side the lake. Great views.
96,4.0,Huge modern well laid out building.  Wheel chair friendly with lifts.  Many displays have an English translation.  Maps and other information available in several languages besides English or Korean.  Easily accessible from Seoul metro getting off at Ichon station. Well worth a visit to learn about the history of Korea and beyond. Also worth visiting the Hangeul museum next door.
97,4.0,"I visited this museum on my fourth travel to Korea, and I'm still thinking it's a mistake. For better understanding of Korean culture it must be visited immediately after your arrival.Entrance is free. Very friendly to English speakers. Amazing and huge building with a nice design and breathtaking views from the city."
98,5.0,This is one huge and well laid out museum. I enjoyed exploring each exhibit and taking pictures of precious items that are important to the people of South Korea. Admission is free to explore this massive museum. There were many students there today on a field trip which made it more exciting to see children learning history. Worth the trip to come and see.
99,5.0,"The building is marble lined with alot of natural light which they utilize in a unique way.  The building is huge but the must-see are Baekje Burner, the Treasures from the Tomb of Hwangham. The ten story pagoda carved from marble is absolutely stunning! They do offer guided tours in english every hour (highly recomend)."
100,2.0,"Scale if the building doesn't reflect the quantity of exhibits inside. Very thinly  spread objects in a massive cavern of a place, they could have shown everything in a building a fraction of the size."
101,5.0,Go here. You can spend a few days in this four story place. It is a stop the subway.There are discounted prices. There are also rentals to hear about the exhibits along the way. I forgot the price. I am interested in the Joseon period so I spent most of my time on the first floor. I also went to the fourth floor to the nice café and had cookies and coffee. There is a childrens museum next to this museum. It is centrally located and very easy to find. There are cafe's outside and also places to eat and sit. A must see.
102,5.0,"Prior to arriving in Korea, I intended to visit the national museum. First, I should mention that transportation in Seoul is superb. It is quite easy to navigate the city and find out how to get to your destination.  According to a famous travel book, I learned that this new museum may look deceiving from the outside by its  StarTrak spaceship aura. Don't be alarmed, once you stepped inside, you're in a different world.  There're two buildings: one the left is for special exhibition; one on the right is for permanent exhibits which is free to public. It is clear how hard-working and dedicated the museum curators have been to their national treasures. I went to the top floor first and slowly made my way down. The highlight on the first was a special room for the golden crown from Silla period. I would say that such experience alone is worth the visit. The artifacts presented in organized categories with well-labled translation in English. The spacing and the lighting of each object in its special glass cases were quite pleasing to the eyes. I spent about 3 hours total; wandering 4 floors of this incredible museum. The facility is spotless clean. There's a tearoom/cafe on the top floor; next to a sitting room. Security staff are attentive and courteous. Word of advice: definitely wear your most comfortable shoes."
103,5.0,"its was worth of visit this place. its took me 2 hours and 30min to see everything from ground floor to 3rd floor..if you are really interested in history and collections, this is the best place you must visit..😊"
104,5.0,"I went to this museum during a city tour.  The grounds are beautiful. You will see some interesting things...the girls in their ceremonial Korean gowns are very happy to let you snap their picture.  As for the museum, it is a very good overview of South Korea."
105,5.0,"I spent the better part of a day at the museum.  I learned so much about Korean pre-history and history.  The exhibits were comprehensive and offered just the right amount of information.  I was surprised by the lack of information about Japanese invasions and occupation and the Korean War.  Those might be at another museum, maybe at the War Memorial of Korea?  I did not get to visit that one.  The museum is beautiful, spacious, and light-filled, even on an overcast day.  There were plenty of places to sit and rest.  The subway station had people-movers to the station exit so that you can save your legs for walking all over the museum. The food court near the entrance offered a variety of entrees that were well-prepared and reasonably priced.  The outdoor plaza was a little barren, but we went in November, so that is not too surprising.  It is probably lovely in the spring and fall."
106,5.0,I went here expecting to have to pay some admission fee. Low and behold the museum was free even to foreigners. The museum is massive and if you really wanted to you could spend half a day there. I spent about two and a half hours there and was able to see most of the major exhibits. You get a very thorough overview of Korea's older history.
107,5.0,This is one of my favorite Museum in the world. And if you love Asian History it is a must! This is the most amazing collection of ceramics ever ! Be prepared to spend at least 3 hours or plan on coming back. Even with that amount of time I didn't see everything... Take time to contemplate the Buddha.
108,4.0,"I am getting a bit museumed out. The ground floor was the best for me as it started back in the stone-age where I haven't seen that in any of the other museums, Some of the other floors had lines of pots that were very similar, or open books which if you can't read Korean are just lost in translation. If you are in Seoul for a few days then chose one of the museums, but unless you are into all the Korean history then you will soon be over it. I noticed that on the 2nd and 3rd floors even the locals were walking down the middle. There are two cafes here so you can rest your feet."
109,5.0,"I spent 3 hours in this marvelous place, only managed to go through the exhibit on 1st floor (out of 3 floors, plus special/seasonal sections). Had a better understand on the history of Korea, the various eras and dynasties, vs the development of surrounding countries such as ancient China, Japan etc. A must visit venue for the history buffs."
110,5.0,"I visited the National Museum on my own while on a family vacation. This is an expansive complex that is impressive in its own right. Space is scarce in Seoul, so experiencing the landscaped grounds and the massive building itself is already notable. This is a good break from much of Seoul's commercialism, and it is a good way to spend a cold or rainy day. The main museum would not be fun for kids; it's geared for high school students at a minimum.Getting there: You can get there from the Ichon Station on the Seoul Metro #4 line. This line is convenient because it also runs through Seoul Station and Myeongdong. You need to travel some distance from the stop itself, through two moving walkways, and up weaving stairs. It's possible to travel the entire distance on wheelchair, but if you have trouble walking it is quite a trek.First Floor: If you go through the first floor by beginning on the right side as you enter and proceeding counter-clockwise the exhibit will unfold chronologically from prehistoric times to the beginning of the 20th century. As an American, it's impossible to see Korean history in such quantity at one time. It's quite a treat!Special Exhibit: I was able to see a very manageable but very informative exhibit of the much-overlooked Baekje Kingdom, which goes through the end of January 2017.2nd and 3rd Floors consist of donated works, calligraphy/painting, Asian art, and sculpture/crafts. I did not see these floors.Building: The building itself is extremely large. Others have commented that the museum feels relatively empty. To me, this is a plus. Visitors can explore at their own pace and don't have to worry about being swept up in the crowds.English language: There are a few English language tours, an English language map, and an audio guide which I did not use. Each major section has a good English introduction, and most artifacts have at least an English label."
111,4.0,"I spent four or five hours engrossed in the many exhibits. A good way to spend a wet day. The galleries are arranged by the periods in Korean history, from the paleolithic to the Joseon dynasty, and is an excellent introduction to the country's story.I felt however that the museum could have had more to say about Korea's interaction with its neighbours through the centuries -- trade, cultural, etc --  and about the modern period, including the years under Japanese rule.Then again, better not, as the museum seems to maintain a somewhat nationalistic tone.There is a food court within, with reasonably priced dishes.The museum is easily reached by metro. Get off at Ichon station (light blue line) and follow the signs from there."
112,4.0,I have been to the museum a couple of times. It has an impressive architecture and is particularly beautiful at night with its reflections in the front garden pond. Access to the museum is quite easy by subway and there is a special underground walkway going from the subway station to the museum. There are museum decorations along the subway so it make the walk less boring. There is a huge collection of historical items in the museum and a walk around its compound is enjoyable.
113,5.0,"I would highly recommend spending a few hours in the National Museum of Korea.  The building itself is quite amazing with an obvious amount of Fung Shui consideration going into the layout.  There's a fantastic view of the mountains and the Namsan Tower in the distance.  The grounds with the pond and pagoda are well worth a stroll as well.  All that's even before you even set foot inside!The main building with the permanent exhibits is free of charge.  How can you beat that?  Obviously the main focus is Korean history, beginning with prehistory.  There are a few rooms of various other Asian cultures on the third floor though.  These could probably be missed if you're tight on time or you've seen more extensive exhibits in other museums.The second floor is pretty amazing if you're a fan of pottery, as I am.  I've never seen so much celadon ware in one collection before.  Metalwork too is well represented.The special exhibition hall has a charge attached but at 5000 won (about $4.50 USD), I thought it was more than reasonable.Plan on at least 3 hours or two trips to do the place justice.  As you would do with any other world-class museum."
114,5.0,"The landscape and the building itself is worth visiting, never mind the exhibits ! I was very taken by the architecture of the building right from the entrance, the hallway etc.  For unknown reason, there was hardly any visitor on the day I went. They do not charge admission but I rented the audio for self guided tour for SKW 1000 (approx US $1). The gift shops (one on each floor) have remarkable selection of souvenirs for more than reasonable price. 👍👍"
115,5.0,"Nice museum, surrounded by great outdoor grounds for walking and taking pictures!  Nicely laid out museum, easy to get around in, quite interesting, with a few shops and cafés/tearoom."
116,4.0,"Awed by the grandeur of the palace.  The biggest and the grandest of all the 5 palaces.  There were a lot of people from different nationalities.  Saw the 3 buddhas.  It has the King’s office, A huge kitchen, king’s hall where he entertains his visitors.  I even posed with the palace guards. Truly beautiful!"
117,4.0,Although the exhibits were not that many for its size . Definitely worth visiting though . Modern and welcoming
118,4.0,"Main exhibition are entrance free, I happened to chance upon Hangul day when I went, they have some activities and performance at the atrium,Restaurants served proper food . You can take a walk in the Yongsan Family Park, which is located just next to the museum too."
119,5.0,"To be honest, about half of the artefacts here are presented too drily, shorn of context in plain glass cabinets. Especially on the ground floor. However, the excellent exhibits on the top floor make it worth a visit.  They include a moving, changing frieze of traditional Chinese painting, which is probably the single best thing I've ever seen in a museum anywhere in the world. The gardens are also fantastic: perfectly peaceful in the middle of one of the world's largest cities, very beautiful too. Walk over to 'Dragon Falls', it's simply idyllic!"
120,4.0,"As with all my reviews to sights in Seoul I will preface this by advising visitors to carefully check opening days and times and whether timed entry tickets are needed to access certain parts of the attraction and also the times for booking guided tours in their language of preference – bearing in mind that numbers can be limitedThe reviews here are a little mixed. And I think the reason is that sometimes a building is better than the artefacts it is designed to accommodate. Not to denigrate the artefacts as many are fine objects in their own right and have historical and cultural significance for KoreaThe approach to the building engenders a sense of expectation. A wide open air stair case frames a panorama of north Seoul with the iconic Naksam Tower as a central focus in the distant horizon.Inside the cathedral like space is immense with the entrance being a spectacular rotunda formation soaring to a great height. The sense of space is exaggerated by use of  simple finishes with cream/white marble and stone walls and floors. The entire building is an outstanding example of public architecture on a grand scaleVisitor amenities are excellent. Outside there are pleasant grounds which the hordes of visitors use for picnics and leisureWhen I visited there were numerous school parties dashing around trying to complete their ""I-spy"" books -  they were noisy and intrusive - taking away some of the pleasure of the experiencePublic transport access is easy from the nearby Metro Station"
121,3.0,"The museum building and grounds are very pretty and has its own train station.The first floor inside is the most interesting part in terms of history, everything else is for art lovers I guess and people who can appreciate ceramics. Would be great if they had more exhibits like maybe what prehistoric animals / dinosaurs they had in Korea.If you had to choose between this and the war museum, go to the war museum. Wouldn't spend too long here."
122,4.0,"We spent an afternoon touring around the National Museum of Korea recently and were very impressed. The museum grounds are absolutely lovely. We would recommend walking around the museum to see the reflecting pond, pagoda garden, and other peaceful sights during your visit. The museum collection itself is spectacular with a wide range of artifacts. We took a free guided tour in English and would advise other foreigners to do the same. The museum was crowded with school groups during our visit and it would have been tough to navigate the crowds without our guide. We also learned a lot about the history of Korea on our tour. The museum building is beautifully clean and modern. It also has an excellent gift shop on the 3rd floor where I bought several nice quality souvenirs inexpensively. We definitely plan to return to the museum during a less crowded time so we can see more of the collection. Our favorite items in the collection from our first visit were the Buddha statues."
123,5.0,From the bronze dynasty to the baekje silla goguryeo dynasty to the current era. Everything you need to know is here. There are a number of national treasure displays here. The best part of the whole visit is free of charge.
124,5.0,Get there by line 4 at Ichon station. There are wonderful ground and multi-level floors with exhibits. I am not a great lover of museums and got overwhelmed with this museum.
125,4.0,"If you're interested in Korean history, then this museum is great for you. It's a big museum that takes a few hours to walk around. It's also free entry."
126,5.0,"Beautiful place to visit. I ♡ museums so trying to visit every national museum whenever I get a chance to go. If you are in Korea, I strongly recommend this museum in Seoul. There is also great museum to visit in Kyongju. Folk museum in Suwom is also great place to visit. :) Very easy excess from the metro station and if the weather is good, you can walk around the museum as well. I have post some photos and hope you all can ejoy them!"
127,5.0,Good English descriptions of exhibits covering a wide and varied historical perspective of Korean history and culture.  Superb pottery dating back to the 12th century.  Well worth visiting for anyone who wants to learn about Korean culture and history - many Koreans appreciate this museum too and take their children on weekends to learn about their unique heritage.  That is a sure sign of its significance and value.  A must see while in Seoul!!
128,5.0,"Like so many attractions in Seoul, the Nat'l Museum is free. It's large and clean with air conditioning and free wifi, making it a perfect stop in a busy day of sightseeing. Obviously it doesn't compare to some of the world's greatest but you can't beat the price."
129,5.0,"A place to get all the important facts (and much much more if interested) about the Korean peninsula since palaeolithic era until today. History and art in one place. I went there with the idea of spending one morning there and ended up spending 8 hours. 😂 A huge collection! Don't worry if planning on engaging on a long visit - there's a restaurant with a huge selection of Korean (but also international) dishes. The place itself is quite cool too. And there is a huge park outside with a pond and a some pagoda's (and there's another museum, a smaller one, in the same park).  Huge, great and beautiful - just go!"
130,4.0,"Remarkable collections covering every periods in the Korean history, plus items from other parts of the world too. I started the visit sometime around 10 in the morning and when the museum to close at 6, there were still rooms I have not yet covered! Highly recommended for history-lovers!"
131,5.0,"Except for the location where there's not much things to eat or do around, National Museum of Korea will be able to give you a great insight on Asian art. It's a very modern building with small but serene garden front and back which you can take a small walk around. It's even free! There's sometimes other art or photography exhibitions organized which you must pay to enter. The exhibitions they hold were mostly good."
132,4.0,"The whole museum is very massive and entrance fee is free! Grand history and magnificent treasures! Long live the Korea!So the rate is 5 point 5. Wait! But the explanation words are so small that even Korean people don't know what is treasure or replica. (When I watched the national treasure, one Korean woman said ""Oh, it is good replica!"".) And my eyes were tired to read that tiny words. So I would rate -1."
133,4.0,"I could sum up the content in this museum as the history of Korea, dating from items found by archaeologists hundreds or thousands of years ago, the history of civilisations throughout the centuries, art and sculptures and Buddhist statues from various time periods, etc.It's all quite interesting, and much more history than my own country can display, but it gets a bit overwhelming after a while.Well worth a visit, especially since it's free, but while you could spend 2 hours there, you could see enough in half an hour to satisfy you."
134,4.0,"The arrival there is made very simple and easy, so much so you can easily visit with whatever weather. The park surrounding the huge museum is beautiful and a lot of local kids enjoyed it. I at first visited the right now ongoing exhibition on Sinan Shipwreck and found it very interesting along with impressing, worth the 5000 won I payed to see treasures of a past time. From there I moved into the free National Museum, where you could probably spend a day or several taking in the huge collection. I ended up picking specific rooms to go to in order not to lose myself in the huge establishment. There are walking tours at certain times - I decided to explore on my own. Once you enter the rooms of the displays quiet surrounds you along with beautiful pieces of art. It was a bit distracting with the loud children, but then again that is nothing is new either. There are rooms upon rooms filled with treasures - the signs are in Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese. Outside the spaces are several bathrooms and places where you can have a drink of water. The building is huge and a wonderful trip all together.Only thing I have to admit is that the architecture part didn't really overwhelm me - the interior is beautiful and clear cut, the outside look is okay. P.S. Was lucky enough to even catch a live performance before the entrance to the museum."
135,5.0,"This was such a pleasant surprise!The grounds were beautiful and well kept - take some time to look around before entering.It was the perfect rainy day activity and I spent about 4 hours in total. They have free English guides at 10, 11 and 2pm and I highly recommend it. Plus this museum is FREE! Bonus: it is pleasantly air conditioned and has free WiFI. It was great to learn about Korean history and culture. Closest subway stop: Ichon Enjoy!"
136,5.0,"The museum is bracketed by a large park which is definitely worth a stroll in before/after you visit the museum. It is free to enter and spans three floors, with a fantastic collection of art and ceramics from across Asia and Korean history. The audio guide I found to be non-essential, but does add to the experience and your understanding of the relics and their importance. If you book one, make sure to grab the mp3 for a cheap 1000won instead of the PDA (comes with pictures). Very tourist friendly with English/Chinese explanations on the walls. The only hazard you will face may be hoards of school children here on excursion."
137,5.0,This museum was one of the highlights of my Korea trip. It is located a short 10 minute walk from Yongsan station. The outside area is stunning and perfect for a warm summer's or spring day to stroll around. One of the museum's staff gave us a free tour around and I learned so much about the Korean culture and it's history. The interior has a very contemporary feel and it's big inside with lots of well kept Korean treasures beautifully displayed and well maintained. I have never been to such a beautiful museum and the best thing was the entrance is free. I will definitely go back to this place on my next visit to Seoul. Highly recommend this!!
138,5.0,I really didn't read about the Korean history but when I visited the museum I learned a lot. However the museum was so empty and I felt sad about it!
139,5.0,Loved this museum.  Well laid out and easy to navigate.  Beautiful works of art!  A must see the first time you go to Seoul.
140,4.0,Very spacious museum . There are not a lot of visitors.  I feel very relax and enjoy my visit there.  The ginseng latte is very good in the coffee shop. Also free Wi-Fi and free admission.
141,4.0,The national museum is worth a look it displays alot of history about their dynasty and cultural and religious artifacts. It's 3 levels and have escalators end of each level. It also has some displays of other cultures that existed over the years. It's air-conditioning and quite comfortable to walk around
142,5.0,"I always visit the national museum of the country I visit and so I did the same while in Seoul. It's relatively a small museum when compared to The Louvre, Armitage, and other major museums in Europe and North America. But it is worth visiting. I also enjoyed the coffee shop there. Photos attached."
143,3.0,Hundreds of pots and vases.  Lacked life and interactive displays.  A nice tea house.  Special exhibition area very disappointing.
144,5.0,"I have yet to go inside because of time but I really enjoyed staying outside in the plaza and park. The cantilever frames the axis and really is a nice place to chill with family,"
145,4.0,"Impressive building and exhibits. Exhibits are extensive and well presented, with most interpretive signs in Korean and English. There is much to be learned from a visit here. Admission is free."
146,5.0,you can start in national museum of Korea from the stone time to before smart phone a little time it's great place to know the area history not only Korea history
147,5.0,"-Free admission.-The little convenience stores on site don't jack up the price of good by much. -Don't miss the outdoor sections as well if you come during the spring/summer/fall. They were very beautiful, especially the dragon waterfall."
148,4.0,"Took the subway to the nearby station and it's a short, mostly sheltered walk to the museum. The gardens surrounding the museum are really pretty in spring, it would be good to take a walk around before going inside the museum itself. Inside, the museum is as expected -- many, many artifacts from Korea dating back to the Stone Age. I didn't get an audio guide, but reading the info boards sufficed for me. The museum itself is huge, with exhibits from different parts of Asia. However, it can get disjointed at some points because of the abrupt transitions between different geographical areas. I spent 1.5 hours in the museum, but it was definitely too little if you're interested in exploring the whole museum. If you want to explore everything thoroughly/are a history buff, a day is recommended. Otherwise, a half a day visit should be enough."
149,5.0,"Great view outside the Museum and even inside. they offer English tour guide and give brief story how once Korea was united. You'll learn more on their culture and traditions. Josean Era and Era before that, Koreans are very artistic and stylist from the very beginning. Don't forget that taking pictures are not allowed in other parts inside the Museum."
150,4.0,"This is the 6th largest museum in the world.  The massive size is an attraction of itself.  The museum is Free (closed Monday) and easy to get to by Subway (line 4).  There are 3 floors.  The first floor is the most important as it discusses Korean history (via artifacts) from Prehistoric times to the Joeson dynasty.  There are large # of displays and I would recommend obtaining an audio guide (3,000 won, need ID for deposit).  The audio guide provide details for about 50% of the displays.  If you listen to all the audio stops, you could easily spend several hours.Also recommended is the free English tour (1 hour).  Our guide was very informative and provide perspective about Korean history and culture.  Unlike the audio guide, which provides a snippet of information (30-60 seconds) per exhibit, the guide will spend 3-5 minutes on a display to go into much greated depth and detail.The 2nd and 3rd floors have ""miscellaneous"" exhibits.  While of interest in their own right, it seems more ""disjointed"" than coherent."
151,5.0,"If you have 4-5 hours, then it really deserves to pay a visit. Firstly the museum itself is great, secondly it exhibits a pretty comprehensive collection that starts from Paleolithic Era to Joseon Dinasty. If you want to know more about Korea's history, then it's a must!"
152,4.0,"Visit on rainy day, interesting facts and items about Koreas' history. Helps a lot to know Koreas' history beforehand."
153,3.0,"Museum had lots of artifacts of the history of Korea, not so much with paintings but with stone and gold work as well as some jewels.  Depending on your interest can spend an hour to several hours.  Grounds are spread out and can find plenty of places to sit and enjoy the garden areas."
154,5.0,"High class Museum. Very modern design, easy navigation through the various rooms and topics, large enough not to be crowded, concise explanations (in English too), free (yes!) ... and fantastic items on show. It was a pleasure all the way visiting this Museum. Note: If you just want to walk through, only stopping briefly in front a few spectacular pieces, I guess about 1.5 hrs are necessary. A more quiet visit may need about twice as much. I'd advise at least 2 hrs and be selective as there are very diverse topics exposed that are not likely to be of interest for everybody."
155,5.0,"Lovely building in a gorgeous, peaceful setting. Art and history are displayed thoughtfully throughout the museum....open and inviting. Items on display often took ones breath away ... stunning! I took a tour with a museum volunteer (in English) which was chock full of facts about Korea and its history."
156,5.0,"THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF KOREA….ONE OF ASIA’S GREAT MUSEUMSThis is a truly amazing museum, set up in  a very large functional  building of contemporary design. Its exhibits are arranged in various period galleries – covering pre-history and ancient history of Korea, medieval and early modern history, calligraphy and painting, Asian art, as well as Korean  sculpture and arts. The Pre-history and Ancient History Gallery starts with the Paleolithic and Neolithic Periods, and covers the ascent of various Korean kingdoms, up to the Balhae kingdom. Among the exhibits are ancient farm implements, clay pottery of considerable geometrical accuracy, a range of weapons including steel swords, daggers, spearheads, arrowheads, and axes.  There is a beautifully-carved stone dagger, as well as stone tools, wood implements and the like from the Bronze Age. Among other exhibits of that period are a milling stone to grind acorn, and an early example of a dugout canoe. Korea’s Unified Silla Period is represented by a very ornamental gold crown of the royalty of that period. Its exquisite design and the high quality of workmanship would have done credit to a more contemporary product. There is also a range of jewellery, including necklaces and earrings  that had once graced the queens and princesses of that era. Of particular interest are gold, silver, bronze and iron vessels recovered from Silla Dynasty tombs.  A particularly rich haul has been from the tomb of King Huryeong of the Baekje period. This section of the museum has well over 7,500  carefully-selected artifacts of exceptional quality. The Medieval and Early Modern History Gallery has artifacts dating back to the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties. There is a very interesting section on Korea’s  Hangeul alphabet, and the metal printing types to print documents in that language. In that respect, Korean culture had achieved considerable precedence over Europe. The exhibits include several ancient documents in Hangeul. The Dharani Sutra woodblock printing technique of an earlier age, is said to date back to rhe eighth century, and is claimed to be “the oldest existing woodblock printed scripture in the world”. All credit to Korean culture.A section on the Joseon period showcases massive wooden furniture. Interestingly, they had separate furniture for men and for women, in that day and age. The section on Asian art has the  finest artifacts from India and Southeast Asia, Central  Asia. China and Japan. Among the high-quality  religious statues from India is  an exceptional one of God Siva and his consort Parvati.  In the Chinese section are a series of paintings laid out side by side. A closer look, however,  shows the water flowing in the rivulet across all five paintings. Boats ply on the water, while a little bird flies across the  paintings. These are very cleverly made movies. It is utterly brilliant.There is an awesome collection of Chinese porcelain obtained  from the Sinan shipwreck. The ship was carrying exquisite pottery from China  for use by Japanese temples, when it was wrecked.The section on porcelainware must be the envy of most other museums in the world. There is Buncheongware, celadon, as well as white porcelain. Particularly stunning is a celadon Ewer featuring a mythical creature with the body of a fish and the head of a dragon. This section also has audio-visual presentations  on quality porcelain craftsmanship.Equally fascinating is the section on Buddhist art and sculpture. Buddhism came to  Korea during the Three Kingdoms period. Some of the guilded metal statues of Buddha are of exceptional intricacy.  The Pensive Bodhisattvas are regarded by Koreans as “national treasures”, and are products of exceptional craftsmanship.  A large portrait of Buddha stretches from the floor to the ceiling. That section also has Buddhist metalware, Buncheongware and white porcelain.Among the most amazing exhibits in the museum is a ten-storey pagoda from the Gyeongcheonsa Temple site. It stretches almost from the ground floor to the roof of the museum, and is intricately carved from graniteDigital and audio guides are available on rental. These are in Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese. There are also programmes for visitors of all ages, from children onwards. There is a children’s museum that offers educational programmes for them. A library of reference works, museum shops that sell cultural products, restaurants, cafes, an 805-seat theatre for cultural programmes, free loan of strollers and wheel chairs for those who need them, as well as toilets, are among the facilities on offer. The museum’s permanent collections are  free for visitors, while the special exhibitions are charged admission. Parking for visitors’ cars is also charged. The museum is closed on Mondays, 1 January and on all holidays. The visit was an emotionally rewarding experience. Hormuz P. Mama"
157,5.0,Bring your walking shoes and thinking caps because there's a lot to walk and see here in Ichon dong.  They have exhibits on every period of Korean history from the Gogoryeo to the waning days of Joseon.  A very great rainy day activity as well.  The grounds are popular for people taking family photos as well.
158,3.0,The National Museum of Korea is huge. The exhibition is very interesting but you might get bored after a few hours spent in the museum. I would suggest to do the different exhibition in different days as the museum is free.
159,5.0,Travelled to the museum on a Sunday morning by taxi. The Museum has English notes on most of the items. The. Artefacts are very interesting and the knowledge Gai ed most rewarding.
160,4.0,"It is quite a walk from the nearby Ichon metro station. The museum is really too large for just one visit, so better take a leaflet and choose the items you want to see. The museum spans all of Koean history, from the Paleolithic onwards. I particularly liked the Buddhas on the third floor. Access is free. English explanations are rather limited. There are different museum shops, on on each floor, the main one is on the first floor.  The is a nearby the National Hangeul Museum. Could not visit that one though."
161,4.0,National Museum of Korea is a good place to visit if you are a visitor like me who spent a fortnight therel; the admission is for free and it holds exhibits from all over Asia and collections from private donors.
162,5.0,"The museum is really huge and pretty. For people interested in history, this place is a mandatory point to visit. There are explanations in Korean and in English and there are tours available."
163,4.0,Huge collection of artifacts from the past. You can easily spend many hours in the National Museum of Korea.
164,4.0,"The museum's architecture and gardens alone are worth the visit. Allow for at least 2 hours to see the Joseon period exhibits. Not worth renting an audio guide, since almost all of the exhibits have English explanations. This destination is on the Seoul City Tour bus Day Course route."
165,5.0,"a bit of a distance from other sites. Also a bit of a hike from the station, even though station is meant for museum. Simply beautiful grounds and really well done attraction. A place you should visit while in Seoul."
166,5.0,"There is loads to see in this museum, so much that I actually decided to take a full afternoon to see only the permanent exhibits session. The museum is easily accessible by subway. The permanent exhibit is full of interesting artefacts. The admission to the permanent exhibit is free of charge and there are audio guides available for a reasonable price. Definitely an amazing visit while in Seoul!"
167,5.0,This is a great place to visit and should definiltely be included in any visitor's itinerary. The coolest thing is the exact replica of the Korean president's desk where you can get a photo of yourself there. There are tons of other exhibits there so allow time to see everything.
168,5.0,"It has all Korean history. Lots of National Treasure. But entrance is free as of Nov 1st, 2015. The entrance should be at least 10USD. If you are interested in Korean buddhism, history from prehistoric era, this place will be perfect. You will need one hole day. At least half day. :)"
169,5.0,It's rare to be impressed by the exposition of Stone Age objects and it is only first hall of this collection of historical miracles. The creators of the exposition prove that all the objects here are honorable treasures. They prove that they love the history and want the visitors to be involved in this exciting journey through the time.Really worth be seen. It is even sad that it is free of charge.
170,5.0,Check this out. This place has many floors. A lot of stairs but there are escalators too. It aslo has a cool tea house. Try the chestnut drink. Also thus museum had a garden.My favorite floor was the bottom where there is a big budda.
171,4.0,Went here on a rainy day to kill time. Some interesting and educational exhibits. Bring along your passport as deposit for the audio guide which can be rented cheaply (think it was 1000 won).
172,5.0,"Loved the museum, a very large building with tons of space, felt like the exhibitions were a bit exclusive, very clean and nice. Also visited temporary Buddhist exhibition near the museum which was awesome. Do recommend!"
173,5.0,I spent about three hours here and saw all three floors.  Take metro line 4 in direction of Oido and get off the Ichon stop exit 2. There is an underground path that takes you directly to the museum. Once above ground the museum is right in front of you. It's free!  Plenty of seating throughout the visit so you can rest in between exhibits.
174,4.0,Free entry and very nice and relax area. The museum is vast but not very impressive. If you want to understand little bit more about Korea ancient history it's a good place to start but in the end you'll seen a lots of ceramic stuff. The most interesting part is the Buddhist part
175,5.0,If you are history buff like me and always tend to visit National Museums in every country you visit. This is exactly for you. A great journey though Korean history in this multilevel modern and beautifully designed building. I joined a group of travellers in the english tour which took us through the highlights of the Museum. The tour guide was very knowledgable and answered question of the group and very helpful. Try the tea in the Koren tea house on the top level which overlooks a nice garden and views Itaewon.
176,5.0,"Ticks all the boxes you would expect from a national museum, with a huge variety of items and excellent signs that follow chronologically to give you a great look into the history of this fascinating country. The building itself is very modern and has an elegant setting. You can easily spend half a day in here."
177,5.0,"This museum is a great way to learn about ancient Korea and how it has changed over the years. There are tours available for foreigners, although you can opt to have a listening device if your  tour is over for the day. It is a good way to spend a rainy day."
178,5.0,"This museum is a ""don't miss"" on your itinerary. First, this modern building has a very interesting design. Of course, it's the exhibits that count. I spent most of my time in the extended gallery that displayed  artifacts from the paleolithic to bronze age. It was so clearly laid out and seeing the progression in man's skills and art over that period was fascinating. The best exhibit of its kind that I have ever seen. The explanations in English were very good, but it is still worth paying for the headphones as the explanations were more fulsome."
179,5.0,"This is truly one of the great national museums of the world. It covers the entirety of Korean history, plus has exhibits from China, Japan, India, Central & Southeast Asia, a large gallery of donated items including an ancient Greek bronze helmet, a gallery of items retrieved from the Sinan Shipwreck, stone and porcelain galleries, and a gallery of metalwork and Buddhist sculpture. There is a park of large stone sculptures outside. The highlight of the museum is probably the four Silla gold crowns displayed in several different galleries. While it normally takes me almost a full day to photograph a Chinese provincial museum for my Chinese and World History website, I spent two full days photographing this museum. It is the single best historic attraction in Korea and one of the best in all Asia."
180,4.0,"Museums are all too frequently set aside for rainy/crappy days but this is worthy of a visit, regardless of the weather.To access it, take the #4 line in the direction of Oido and get off at the Ichon stop.  Follow the signs underground for the museum and you will eventually exit the metro at the base of the museum grounds.For a museum dedicated to history, the building is ironically very futuristic and “art nouveau-ish”.  It is laid out over 3 floors, with each floor having a theme.  The first floor, which I found the most engaging, was dedicated to the history of man on the Korean peninsula, from the Paleolithic period through to the 2nd millennium.  It was amazing to see the slow, natural progression from the first, crude stone tools used tens of thousands of years ago all the way to the use of  highly decorative jewelry, pottery, weapons and such some one hundred twenty years ago.The other floors are dedicated to paintings, calligraphy and sculpture.  It’s really only the third floor which decidedly fans out from Korea to include a section of Asian art from the entire continent.The museum is free and closed on Monday."
181,3.0,"The building and the park impressed me the most even if they have an impressive collections of various aspects of the history. Artifacts shown gives a good exposure to all of the Korean peninsula's history from the days humans first the feet on the ground to the present date. Well, at least until 1950s. A pity too many explanations of the artifacts shown where in Korean only. With more info in English I'm sure I would have appreciated it more."
182,5.0,"I showed up for the 11 AM English guided tour.  There were about a dozen of us.  Our tour guide spoke English very well and was very passionate in his tour.  He started off with about a 15 minute overview of the Korean history going back thousands of years.I thought the most interesting portion of his lecture was his explanation of the Korean alphabet.  Obviously he only had enough time, 1 1/2 hours, to hit on the highlights of the museum.   The museum is enormous.  But his tour was excellent.  I would highly recommend."
183,4.0,"My first impression was - WOW! What a huge place, SPACE! Have been living in HK for a year where space is premium, to see and be in this vast place, I was overwhelmed! And to be treated to a surprised open-air traditional concert was a welcome bonus. We quickly walked round one exhibition area (had to get back onto the tour bus). There was a food court where the price is reasonable and the food are delicious. I highly recommend visitors to visit this place."
184,5.0,"I have always love visiting musuems overseas to learn more about the history of the country so this place gets a thumbs up fr me!!! Wished I had more time to spend here, will definitely return again when I am in Korea!"
185,5.0,"The museum is worth visiting alone for the building its in - its a very impressive, big modern building -  both from outside and inside. Visiting is free, and if you have any interest in the history, culture and buddishm in Korea, you should definitely come here.The only big dissapointement for me: I would have loved to get an audio guide. But I didnt have my passport with me, and you need it as a deposit. I offered to leave a money deposit (like I did at Gyeongbokgung), but that was not possible unfortunately. Too bad, as with commentaries you learn so much more about the exhibits.If you are there during lunch time, there is a food court to the west of the entrance. You can get tasty and cheap food there, and its full of locals. There are several stalls, but you order at the ""main desk"", pay there, get a beeper and then collect your food from the stall."
186,5.0,The museum is worth visiting. I lIked the architecture of the museum and the exhibitions too. I could have stayed a total day.
187,5.0,Lovely that the museum is free to visit! A lovely 3 level museum featuring very interesting artifacts. The whole trip took me more than 2 hours because I enjoyed reading everything that was written on the exhibits (descriptions are in English as well!).
188,5.0,"This is a big museum. However I just visited the Korean season and the important life events. The life events were really illuminating. Thoroughly enjoyed the displays and the information. Gave me an insight into their life. I was restricted in time at the museum, I wish that I had had more time to enjoy it."
189,3.0,"Of all the museums I've been to, I recall most having witnessed some masterpieces that ppl read about in books.  The piece are what defines a museum for me and in all honesty (I'm trying to say this as nicely as I can...) I wasn't impressed.  There were a few pieces that caught my fancy...some of the crowns and prints, but there were too many 'unimpressive' items on display. I stopped counting the number of plates they had on display at...50.  I was most impressed with the actual museum because it is so huge and elaborate. That one sitting Buddha was cool too because he had so much character."
190,4.0,"This museum is free!! But they do have a lot of materials. Also, the explanation is really good, well-organized, and English friendly. You can check out the history of Korea briefly, and look around Korean Tradition, too."
191,4.0,"this is big museum and inside gwanghamun palace. I am lucky as I visited here on 16 august - Korea celebrating independence day, so admission fee was also free."
192,5.0,"This museum has great history and art. The main hall is free, and there is a great mix of written explanation, as well as media presentations."
193,5.0,"Probably one of the most interactive museums I've been too in a while. A lot of the displays allowed you to pick things to listen to. They had a water feature/art feature in one of the rooms as well. It was a really pretty place to be, especially on a nice spring day. I would definitely recommend."
194,5.0,If you're wishing to know more about the history of Korea and see some beautiful artifacts I highly recommend a trip to this museum. Many proud Koreans have donated their collections of artifacts to this museum.
195,4.0,"I highly recommend this museum, it is organized in a great way that takes you through the history of the Korean Land and it's people.  Very good exhibits with plenty of English descriptions and dialogue.  I went midweek and it was not at all crowded, I'm sure the weekends are much busier.  A must see for museum lovers while in Seoul."
196,4.0,"the museum is epic, one of the largest in the world. the only thing that I found some what annoying was that I did not understand the full scope of the pieces on display. The english part has only the title while you can see the Korean section is saying way more.Other than it is a pretty cool place to visit especially if the weather is bad or your plans got cancelled or if you're broke since its free!"
197,5.0,"The National Museum of Korea is a shiny new building in beautifully landscaped grounds and is one of the greatest national museums you can visit anywhere. Its permanent exhibition is absolutely massive and covers just about everything to ever happen in Korea, from the invention of stone tools to the 1870s and the beginning of modernization. Each gallery has excellent English descriptions, but many of the artifacts are stunning and speak for themselves. The glorious Silla dynasty crown is by far the must-see item of the collection, although there are countless statues, pieces of jewelry, tools, household items and other treasures which bring the fascinating history of this country to life. As someone who is usually not interested in Asian history and art, I was pleasantly surprised by how interested I became during the many hours I spent here. The upper floors are dedicated to themed displays, such as Buddhist painting or items from Japan or Central Asia, but I chose not to spend much time there as the Korean history sections were overwhelming in their content and quality. The National Museum was undoubtedly a highlight of my trip to Seoul and I wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone!"
198,4.0,"Be warned it is closed on Mondays. The National Museum is free and has a lot of beautiful artwork and  artifacts. If you are interested in Korean culture I would definitley go here. If it is not raining I would take time to walk around the park in front of it. If you have time and are studying Korean, the hangul museum is really interesting. It has exhibits on the creation of the hangul characters."
199,4.0,"The place is just off the Ichon train station.  There is an underground path from the station to the Museum entrance, so look for the signs.  The museum ground is huge.  From the outside it beats any of the palaces in grandeur and scale.  A huge lake is in front, and the back is the Namsan tower.  There are plenty of displays about Korean history.  There's even a nearby museum for the Korean language.  Inside are good cafes and restaurants.  So anyone can easily spend a whole day here, if you are ok with the peace and quiet.  I was there on a weekday."
200,5.0,"A nice, spacious museum. Wonderful Celadon and other style pottery! The collection of ancient Asian pottery and artifacts recently recovered from a sunken ship is especially interesting."
201,5.0,"Decided to go to the museum on the night it was open until 8pm. No other people to be seen ! For a free musuem, you can't go wrong. Lots of interesting things to see at your own pace. Great view of N Tower too."
202,3.0,"The building is enormous and ugly and the collection on display is rather disappointing and small for such a huge space (perhaps 5 to 6 times larger than the British Museum but less that 10% of stuff displayed there). Too much space for so little stuff, unless of course you are info Korean history (there is a large section of the rest of Asia that does not follow any historical or geographical logic). It has a lovely collection of Korean ceramics. In fact, this is the only think I enjoyed. For other stuff of Korean royal history best to head to the Nationl Palace Museum, which is elegant, intimate and superb."
203,5.0,"There are hour long tours of the highlights in English at 10, 11 and 1400 which give you a good orientation.  I bought the museum book which helped me to choose the top sights.  Don't forget to look at the the building itself and to walk around the grounds, there is a pagoda garden, a small stream and waterfall and lovely trees."
204,4.0,"The place is HUGE. I arrived later than I planned and made it through maybe half in 2+ hours. It's free to go to the main exhibition hall, so I didn't lose anything. If I get a chance I may go back. Another reviewer called it boring, maybe it is. This is probably not for everyone, there's loads of artifacts from long ago, and there is a lot of Korean history that can be witnessed but if that's not something you're into skip this place."
205,5.0,"incredible collection of pottery, porcelain--with galleries by era--plus beautiful building and grounds with a bell tower and gardens"
206,4.0,The museum is large and there is a lot to see; you can learn about of Korean history.  The main exhibit hall is free.  Their gift shop has some nice made-in-Korea items.
207,3.0,"Walk from tour bus to museum way too long for and old person.  By the time I reached the museum, which is fantastic, I was really too tired to enjoy it fully"
208,5.0,Impressive building in lovely setting. Collection of Korean art is unsurpassed. Everything is described in English as well as Korean.
209,5.0,"This museum is HUGE. I've been there three times, and I still haven't seen everything. There is a mixture of art and history exhibited permanently, which is free; and special exhibits that you have to pay to see. This is a nice place to get an introduction to Korean history and the style of art the Koreans have used throughout history. You could easily spend all day here and still not see everything they have to show you. The only think that sucks about this place is the location. Since the building is so massive, it has been build kind of far from restaurants and other attractions. However, there are some restaurants and a convenience store outside."
210,5.0,"Located in a purpose-built stately building and surrounding grounds, this museum is one of the best national museums I have ever visited. It takes you through the entirety of Korean peninsular history in a stepped, gradual way, so one can digest the ""whole picture and truly learn something about this fascinating part of the world and its peoples. The exhibits are superb, and the assets and history are treated as belonging to the whole peninsula, so one walks away thinking of just one united Korea. The museum shop has amazing items that are hard to walk away from and could leave your credit card maxed out! Most incredible, entry was free!! There is also a mini-food hall to rest your feet and sample some nice Korean cuisine.A must-do in Seoul, allow 3 - 4 hours."
211,4.0,the title already explains it :) you can learn everything about korea's history from prehistoric time here.
212,4.0,What I liked about the National Museum of Korea is that it didn't take up my entire day to explore and enjoy.  It also has a great food court/restaurant area to have lunch before moving on with your day.When I arrived I checked in with the English speaking guide who told me an English guided tour had just left.  Within seconds she got on the radio and asked security where the group was at that moment.  I was escorted over and joined the tour.  That was great and unexpected and I didn't waste a single minute of time.  The guide was also very knowledgeable and was happy to answer questions from the group I was with.The museum has a beautiful collection with a beautiful history.  I recommend taking a tour or picking up the audio self guided tour to make sure you don't miss a beat.The day I went also had a lot of school children in attendance which made it fun and very lively.
213,5.0,"As other reviewers have mentioned, the museum is large in scope and covers a wide swath of Korean history. I spent half a day here, but definitely did not have the time to look at everything in depth. One could easily spend the entire day browsing artifacts from ancient to modern Korean history. As someone who admittedly was not as familiar with the history of Korea, I definitely got a better sense of the different dynasties and historical figures. I had just come from visiting Buddhist sites in India, so the large array of Buddhist statues was interesting to see how the styles differ between different regions. The grounds outside are also good for walking and have a few statues and birds flying about. Did I mention that it's also free?"
214,5.0,Great museum and well worth the time.  You could spend a couple days in there if you have the patients.  English translations are pretty good.  Best and most comprehensive Korean museum I've seen yet.  Everything else is just redundant and incomplete.
215,5.0,"This museum gives an insight of Korea's history. Anyone who visits this museum without any knowledge of Korea, will leave the museum with substantial knowledge of this lovely country. That's guaranteed!"
216,5.0,"Every time I visit Seoul, I squeeze in a trip to the National Museum. It's free so if nothing's changed, that's ok. It's a great space just to wander around. But the installations change regularly and so, it's always interesting. It's a great place to learn about Korean imperial history and more recently, it has been building the section that shows not only imperial Korea's connection to China but to the Silk Road as well. It also has free air conditioning in the summer and, so, if you are looking for somewhere to get some reprieve during the monsoon season, this is a great place to kill two birds with one stone. There is a cafeteria that gets really crowded, and a nice tea/coffee place on the 2nd or 3rd floor that serves a great green tea paht bing soo in the summer. Cooling and culture in one trip = time well spent."
217,4.0,"Great place. They have a device that you can listen to in the language of your choice (voice guided tour?) It can detect where you are and it will play the recording for that exhibit or you can pick which one you want to hear.  The device was not free, I believe you had to rent it for 1000 KRW, around $1 US.  They had very nice exhibit and cool artifacts."
218,5.0,"I went to the National Museum of Korea based on TripAdvisors reader recommendations. The first impression when you arrive at the museum is how large and modern the two buildings look. The museum site on a slight hill so you look up at it when you arrive. In front of and below the museum is a large ""Mirror"" pond which the museum bldgs reflect into. Surrounding the pond are large, open, granite covered patios, benches and a couple of small coffee shops.The museum is made up of two large complexes left and right with a bldg above and between them. When you walk up the impression is of a large picture frame with a photo of the hills behind the museum.Nice.I paid approximately $12 to see the Pompeii exhibit that is currently on loan. There are headsets for a self guided tour and an app that will also take you through both museum's exhibits. All of the signage was also translated into English.After the Pompeii exhibit I went into the main bldg housing the exhibits on Korean history.There was no entry fee into this building.All of the exhibits were well kept, signage was again in many languages including English. Notes:- It may be the time of year but both bldgs/ exhibits were fairly empty. It made for relaxed viewing.- The museum grounds are spotless. Not a piece of litter anywhere.- Since the museum sits on a little hill there are stairs but also ramps for easy access.- There elevators or stairs to get to the various levels of the exhibits.- There is a large gift shop in the museum. - Refreshments: A couple of coffee shops where the taxi/ buses drop you off and a couple inside the museum.- Plenty of restrooms, clean and easy to find.- There are also ""nursing rooms"" and ""Special Needs"" facilities.All in all an excellent experience, good exhibits. I have to compliment the Korean arts community/ Gov't. They seem to have taken into consideration everything to make the experience a pleasant one."
219,4.0,"Take the time to stroll the gardens before spending time inside. The gardens are very neat, and inside the museum is huge and well laid out to explore."
220,5.0,lovely ultra modern museum over three floors.  It's a little noisy in the main halls but the exhibition rooms are very good.  You can take photos and the lighting is good. The museum shop is also well worth visiting.The wi if is fast and FREE.
221,3.0,"Free Entry, huge and beautiful filled with tons of artifactsThe exhibits are definitely impressive and quite informative ."
222,3.0,great knowledge of korean culture. But need to be more elaborate and cleaned. More artifacts and explanations in english is necessary for foreigners to be fed with informations
223,5.0,"National Museum of Korea and Hangul Museum of Korea are situated in adjoining locations.Hangul Museum is about origins of Korean Alphabets  made by their King about 500 years BC. well explained, showing its ease , its importance in day to day computer age. NATIONAL MUSEUM is much bigger, in the foreground is a large oval mirror pond which shows the museum buildings, outside are  well spread gardens with Buddha Statues and a couple of Pagodas, a family picnic park.Museum has an art Gallery on Ground floor presently showing POMPEII Italian ancient city.Other three floors well connected by good elevators to go up and come down show ancient history of mankind and animals, Sections showing history/ culture of India, Japan, China and Korea.Many ceramics, tools, paintings and statues are well preserved and documented..Guides available.A GOOD FEEL OF HISTORY.A good Souvenir shop too."
224,4.0,"Definitely lucked out and scored a tour with a super friendly and helpful guide, who kept us all laughing and not getting to bogged down in details. The golden crown is beautiful & there is loads to keep you interested for long after the tour finishes.Also check out the architecture, huge building and very interesting to look at from different angles."
225,5.0,"The building itself is very impressive, and there is just SOOO much to see that you need to visit more than once to take it all in. Free English-speaking tours by very good docents are also available and worth your while."
226,4.0,When I went to this museum I honestly did expect a lot of boring displays. But in the end it was really interesting. From the ground floor which has a fast array of early Korean artifacts. To the top floor which has magnificant art and private collections.If you are with friends that enjoy museums you can go through all of it. But for children I would just recommend the ground floor.
227,5.0,Excellent half day tour . Take your time to read Korean history. The facility is clean and full of learning kids that is A + to look around not just the past and also present time.
228,5.0,"I always make time to see a couple of museums wherever I go.  This was one of the best of its kind.  Art and history together, everything in context, and beautifully displayed. I know a little about Asian history so I really enjoyed learning more about it. But if you knew nothing, there's plenty to read so you know what you're looking at. The building itself is lovely, and there's a great variety of art and artifacts."
229,5.0,Beautiful location and architecture with ponds.History of Korea is well exposed with many artefactsNice restaurant outside on left of main entrance
230,5.0,"This museum has terrific exhibits of historic items, beautifully displayed.  We visited this as part of a field trip for the IMCoS symposium."
231,5.0,"If you know nothing about Korea's history, the national museum is a great place to learn a bit about it. I spent around 6 hours there and enjoyed very much this museum, It is very well organized. There is a restaurant there with good food and not so expensive. The outside area is also beautiful, especially during autumn time."
232,5.0,This is a splendid architectural building and the museum's display shows a high degree of expertise. I spent four hours there with not a single tedious moment.
233,1.0,"I went early morning of 19th October 2014 to National Korean museum because I wanted to spend a half day there! First of all I found building architecture's beautiful. I liked building outside decoration of garten, plantpots, pool and pavillon. Museum entry is free! Object and exhibited items should be varied and very interesting! But there had been a serious issue with museum male employees who were disturbing me in every hall I entered because they were seeking attention! At each time they walked fast towards my direction while making noises like coughing and that made me nervous! So I couldn't concentrate checking exhibition items! I entered museum at around 09:00 am and almost no visitors were there. I just sow a school class and another visitors group.I unfortunately decided to break off visit and went to check interesting big souvenir shop!"
234,3.0,"The museum is immense, but it felt like each exhibit was just more and more pots with different labels. Got a bit boring after a while. The Korean history part is somewhat interesting, but the timeline isn't spelled out clearly and the audio guide is pretty bad. It's designed as a dialogue w/ the student often just repeating a question by asking, ""Really?"". It also doesn't work at all exhibits. Only costs 1000 Won so can't ask for much."
235,4.0,I booked with Seoul city tours and was very dissapointed with their tour. We were told that we only had time for the third pavilion but that was ok because it was the best one.   It was impossible to see anything in 30 minutes.  What I did manage too see was a great reflection on the history of life in Korea. See this on you own so you are not at the whim of a tour
236,5.0,"This museum is huge and I had limited time, so I focused on the halls of Buddhist statues and paintings, which were of especial interest to me. Both collections were excellent and contained many rare treasures, including the very famous pensive bodhisattva. I also walked through the celedon ceramics collection, which contained a lot of information on the distinctive Korean artform. I would have liked more time to spend in this massive museum. The gift shop has a very nice collection of souvenirs. If you want cultural and historical background of the Korean people, you should go to the National Folk Museum at Gyeongbokgung Palace. If you want art, come here. But really you should definitely visit both!"
237,3.0,"A good starting to know Korean Culture. The admission if free, why not have a visit if you have time to do so. The atmosphere of the museum is great, I spent the evening there by just sitting on the park after the visit."
238,5.0,I thought it was strange that this place is free for a museum. Though it gives you a better understanding of the Korean Culture. A definite must visit place when you are in Seoul.
239,5.0,"I am not a museum goer but bowed to the pressure of my friend.  I enjoyed the museum both inside and outside - architecturally, it's great!  It has lots of little nooks with vistas of the beautiful landscaping where one can process what one has seen.  The early Korean artifacts are particularly worth the visit."
240,4.0,It is worth numerous visits with free admission. I keep returning since there is so much to see.  An English Auduo guide is available.
241,4.0,"The National Museum of Korea is a nice place to visit if you want to understand the Korean history  and culture. It is the 6th largest in the world and the largest in Asia in terms of space. Therefore it entails a lot of walking if you really want to survey the whole area. No need to worry if you get tired, there are lots of sitting areas and drinking fountains strategically placed. It also has a guided tour in the afternoon with English speaking guide. If you want to join the guided tour, be at the lobby before 2pm. The gift shop also has a good selection of souvenir items. Outside, there are other places of interest like the Yongsan Park, Dragon Falls, Pagodas and the like."
242,4.0,It`s an interesting lesson of Korean history. There are also cafes and restaurants and many rest areas.
243,5.0,"There you can follow the Korean history from start to almost nowadays. Also they have a really nice collection on eastern art, I was really impressed by a Buda statue from Pakistan/Afganistan border, it had an Helenic style probably because Alexander the Great being in that zone."
244,3.0,I wouldnt have gone here if I wasnt in Seoul for 10 days - if you are here for less I would recommend going to a Temple or another site instead (unless you are REALLY into Korean history) there are 3 floors (which are free to see) and numerous sections with art and collections - I really would recommend this if you are a huge museum and Korean fanaticThere are other exhibits which you must pay for but the general admission was freeThe museum was so crowded! The museum itself and its location was nice
245,5.0,"The National Museum of Korea must rank among the best museums I have ever visited. Unlike many national museums that just cram centuries of artifacts into small, poorly illuminated displays, this museum is huge, well organized and most comfortable to get to and walk in. Very near to a metro station, you are wowed even before you enter it. I mean, the main building is massive, and once inside I really appreciated the open, airy space that made me just want to be there all day.The ground floor is for Korean history, and each hall is reserved for a certain period. I thoroughly enjoyed going on this time-machine journey through the centuries and learning about many facets of Korean history unknown to me. There were English information boards and plates everywhere. The English used here is surprisingly perfect. The displays were well spaced and clearly lit. I went to the museum just after it opened so was able to enjoy an hour or so of relative peace before student groups started arriving. I did not have time to explore the upper floors featuring Asian art, but did buy a ticket to the lovely Musee d'Orsay exhibition. I saw the real d'Orsay in Paris but it was good to see some of the works in Seoul as well.I know most tourists hit the palace circuit when in Seoul, but if you have time and perhaps a little bit of interest in how Korea came to be, then you will be rewarded with a truly extraordinary museum once you visit here."
246,3.0,"This is an impressive building and collection.however you are only going to enjoy this visit if you have a deep appreciation of korean early history,art,and sculpture.if like me this is not an interest then don't bother.it is some distance from the centre and you must take a taxi."
247,5.0,"I wanted to take a break from palaces, temples, and shopping, so I took the subway (Line 4) to Ichon station (use Exit #2 to emerge to street level) and took the short walk - to the end of the block - to the National Museum of Korea. I really enjoyed my time there. It's a beautiful, spacious, bright and modern building. The three floors each have a place to get refreshments just to regroup and reflect from the exquisite pieces (e.g., traditional tea house on the 3rd floor, a cafe on the 2nd, and on the 1st floor, a restaurant on one end and a food court on the other). First floor: Special exhibitions; sculpture and crafts; art from India and Southeast/Central Asia, China, Japan and the Sinan ShipwreckSecond floor: Donated works (some galleries have really impressive collections); calligraphy and paintingsThird floor prehistory and ancient history gallery; medieval and early modern history gallery. Oh, the property also has a children's museum, library, and beautiful gardens.In addition to sign language and Korean, guided tours are offered in English, Japanese and Chinese. The museum also has different gallery talks, etc. I skipped the tour only because I had just come from the adjacent Impressionism exhibit and I wanted to browse the galleries at my own pace. One of the things I loved about this museum is the number of lounges, nooks and alcoves sprinkled throughout the building. Some of them are large with, for example, a expansive view of the garden or outdoor exhibitions below; others are cute little areas off to the side so you can sit and relax; and others are actually small media rooms so you can see short films on some of the works in that particular gallery.Tip: If you're in Seoul through the summer, the museum's Impressionism exhibit from the Musee d'Orsay runs until August 31, 2014. It's 12,000 KRW and audio rental is 3,000 KRW. Since the National Museum itself is free, I didn't mind paying this extra cost for the visiting exhibit. That way, I got to enjoy the museum's permanent collections and also enjoy some pieces from the Musee d'Orsay. Pourquoi pas?"
248,4.0,"I first visited this place with my school. As schools would, they gave us like 1.5 hours, a worksheet to complete and set us upon the museum like some unfortunate Running Man game without prize, nametags-ripping nor a scary Kim Jongkook. That was not how I wanted to remember this place.I went again with my mum. We took 1 day for each level! As a matter of fact, at this very moment, we have yet to complete Level 1!!! We walked 2 whole days for Levels 2 and 3!This museum has an expansive collection of artifacts both from Korea and from other Asian regions. At the entrance of each section, there are boards to explain the significance of each collection. All artifacts are labelled in Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese. There are also guided tours.However... Please do check for grammatical and spelling errors of the displays. ""They go"", not ""they goes""; ""frog"" not ""flog"". Also, 단풍 should be maple, not cherry. The mentioned mistakes were found in the paintings section but I cannot remember which level. My mum's vegetarian and I would like to commend one of the museum staff for recommending us a vegetarian restaurant when he heard about her dietary preference. Also, the restaurant on Level 1, NaMu, was willing to prepare Jeonju Bibimbap without egg. However, they served up banchan with egg rolls and kimchi which contained shrimp paste as ingredients. So do make sure you explain your dietary requirements in detail!This museum is free, allows non-flash photography and has a lot of benches for people to rest at when they are tired. I recommend people to visit this if they have a strong interest in history as well as art. [At the moment, I have not visited the Children's Museum but kids might like that better than this....]"
249,5.0,"This is everything a museum should be.  I was amazed at the number of school kids eagerly learning when I was there.  They were free to use their ipads and to photograph whatever interested them.  They did.   This museum covers the history of anthropology, art, sculpture, and paintings from pre-historic to modern times.  For the Western visitor, it's an education in the dynamics of this region of the world."
250,5.0,"This was one of the hop on hop off stop. I spent more than an hour here. It seems to be far away from the town centre.I am not well versed in Korean history so I did not know what to expect. The building itself is very impressive. Huge buildings with large grounds. But the exhibits seems to be lacking..there are some prehistoric exhibits of pottery etc, artifacts from the Joseon era, some private collections. I could have missed some exhibits cos I did not want to miss my bus. Somehow I thought there should be more from each era, maybe the types of attire worn.  Anyway good for a quick visit . There was a lot of local students there on  the day of my visit."
251,5.0,This is a beautiful and very large museum. The pottery is magnificent. Entrance is free and the food court is good and inexpensive.
252,5.0,its really big and its free to go in and i especially liked seeing the very first newspaper in korean writing and i liked the gift shop and you can read about loads of things in english and its not difficult to find just walk a bit from the subway
253,4.0,"The foodcourt is excellent, so come hungry. the giftshop has some unique and well priced arts too - so it's worth stopping by here too. The museum itself is above average and has some good displays."
254,5.0,I was happy to visit this museum for the fact that it is one of the top ten museums of the world and rightfully lives up to its reputation with so much artifacts and exhibits that makes your jaw drop. The only problem I had around this place was that they had a very limited amount of information in English and rest everything is written in Korean and whatever small amount of information was written in English didn’t even suffice to make you get the point of the whole display. I was fortunate enough to actually get a guide with me that made me enjoy the place and appreciate it much more effectively. The palace also has a good restaurant that has a good quality food and a good ambiance to relax after all the walking.
255,4.0,"very good museum !but its so huuge, if you really want to see everything its going to take 4 hours....it is freeeasy access from subwayTake Line 4 or the Jungang Line (Yongmun-Yongsan) to Ichon Station. Go out Exit 2, and walk 150m towards Yongsan Family Park. its closed on mondays"
256,3.0,"I went to this museum in late afternoon and while the landscaping and architecture of the building were great, I really don't care too much about vases from 1100 AD. I was expecting more on the history on Korea and all I got were a bunch of artifacts.   Don't get me wrong, I thought the Buddha castings and calligraphy was very cool, but I spent about 30 mins just quickly browsing."
257,4.0,It was nice to be in a museum that is filled with Korean's learning about their history and artefacts.It is a nice spot to sit outside on the steps and watch the world go by. Easy transport links from the subway system.
258,4.0,"This museum showcases Korean art/artifacts/sculptures/paintings from ancient times to the modern area.  If you're into museums, you could easily spend a day here! Admission is free and there are multi-lingual guide services available for a nominal fee.  If you're inclined, the Yongsan Park is close by where you can take in some of Korea's natural beauty!"
259,4.0,"The National Museum of Korea got a lot of beautiful sculptures, calligraphy and old artifacts, but for me the most impressive was the building, it is very modern with at huge hall made of glass.. so beautiful!"
260,5.0,"This is a real treasure to visit. From the architecture of the building itself to its many rooms filled with amazingly beautifully displayed artifacts, it is well worth the visit if you are in Seoul. But plan to stay for at least a few hours as once you get inside, you will not want to leave! And there are 2 gift shops with some tastefully done souvenirs. :-)"
261,3.0,"For a national museum, you'd expect to see a lot more of Korean culture on display. This museum was more about Korean history and government. Since it's free admission, if you have time, this museum would be a good time filler. Otherwise, for a more cultural insight into Korea, check out the National Folk Museum or the National Palace Museum."
262,5.0,"This was free when I went there, and I could learn a lot about korean culture and history, so this is one of my top 3 museums in Korea!"
263,3.0,"I enjoyed my trip to the National Museum but it wasn't my favorite museum I visited while in Seoul. Maybe that was because it was towards the end of my trip but I think it was more that this museum focused on items collected from different eras of Korean history rather than telling you about the eras.I prefered the Korean Folk Museum that did a better job of orienting you to the different eras of Korean history. However, many of the artefacts at the National Museum of Korea were very beautiful and very special.I also found the museum a bit unrelatable. Many of the exhibits lacked English signs and many were not available to listen to on the audio recorder. I felt like you had to already have a good understanding of Korean history to appreciate many of the items.It was an okay museum with nice artefacts but if you are limited in time, spend your time at the other museums in Seoul."
264,4.0,"I chanced upon an enthusiastic volunteer tourguide during my visit to National Museum of Korea. Spent 3 hours there, and he could not stop talking about different pieces and their history.Time well spent!"
265,4.0,"This is a very impressive building and not only were there Korean artifacts and history there was bits and pieces from all over Asia as well as a special exhibit on Islamic art and the history behind it. The museum is free, but the special exhibitions cost about 13,000 won, which I feel is a little overpriced, but I really enjoyed every minute there.Note: Going to a museum in Korea is not like going to a museum in any other country I've been to children run around people talk very loudly and will block an entire exhibit. If you struggle with that you may want to do what I did which is listen to music to block out the sound. Doing that made it much more enjoyable for me."
266,3.0,"I'm always excited with the prospect of visiting a museum (or any other informal learning institution) for the first time. There is a tingling sense of anticipation when you first see the building from a distance and as you walk up to the lobby, you begin to visualise the wonders to be experienced within. The National Museum of Korea was no different except that the walk to the entrance was so long that by the time I reached the building itself (after being deposited at the main road by bus), I was physically spent.To call the museum sprawling is an understatement. It's a massive footprint and ranks among the top ten largest museums in the world. Just walking from point to point including within the building will take you hours. Though I never expect to 'finish' a museum experience in one visit (or however many since the experience always evolves), the National Museum of Korea is particularly draining although there are some gems in the expansive collection.It's worth noting that the outdoor experience is worth checking out too but I did wished for more leisure friendly facilities like an affordable cafe. There's enough seating and water dispensers but the restaurants I stumbled on were a little pricey (including the premium gift shop). However, I didn't have a chance to fully experience every area so perhaps I may have missed some of the facilities I was looking for.In general, the museum is free to visit but special galleries may have additional charges. There's a children's museum and the main museum consists of significant permanent galleries with changing ones too. It's not too far out from downtown Seoul (took me around 30 minutes by tour bus) and I believe it's also accessible by train (do check the website). The museum is somewhat sterile inside - hushed, not too welcoming, and oh-so serious but well, it is a 'national' museum after all. Even though there are lots I missed in my half day visit, I really wouldn't need to go back."
267,3.0,"It's a nicely laid-out museum with helpful maps and some interesting items. However, there is FAR too much of the same thing over and over again. I have a particular fondness for museums but in Korea, I would recommend cycling around Gyeongju. It's the best museum Korea has to offer, and no walls! ^^"
268,4.0,"museum was lovely with its massive and modern structure, but information about some artifacts displayed were not too informative. The food court was great offering different cuisine from italian, indian, thai and korean food."
269,5.0,"A most wonderful introduction to this great country. Spent 2 and a half hours here, every minute worth it."
270,5.0,Lots of world class art and artifacts that give a great introduction to Korean culture. The building is spectacular and it's all free!
271,4.0,"Worth a trip - it's free, you can take photos (no flash, no tripods) and you get a good overview of Korea (and neighbouring countries). Easy to find your way around, and some lovely exhibits such as the ten-storey pagoda and the pensive Buddha.The Korean tea shop upstairs is really good too - good range of teas and a nice place to put your feet up!"
272,3.0,"This museum is large, well-organized, and has information in English...but I didn't find it as interesting as other places in Seoul. I learned more about the culture by walking around parks, visiting the Korea War Memorial Museum, going to non-verbal shows in the evening, and talking to folks from Seoul. It was not very interactive (like the War Memorial), but still a great way to learn about the Korean culture and history. And it's free so it you don't like it, you didn't lose out on anything!"
273,4.0,"the size of the building itself is astounding. if one had to see the whole collection, it is 4 km of walking. so it is impossible to see everything. great collection of paintings and sculptures, nicely spaced ut, so not crowded. tall pagodai in the lobby. nice museum"
274,4.0,"The building and area around it is quite interesting, and the collection takes you through a history of the Korean peninsula and includes some other interesting artwork and artefacts. It's also not far from the centre of Seoul so worth the trip if you have any interest in history or ancient art and culture.I particularly enjoyed the free English tour. The tour guide used to work for Samsung (unfortunately I can't remember his name). He was very friendly and provided lots of interesting information."
275,4.0,"This museum covers Korean from the paleolithic period to the 5th Joseon Dynasty on the 1st floor, then paintings and statues and donated works on the 2nd floor and more statues and asian art on the 3rd floor. Depending on what you liked, they've got everything covered.And a reflecting pond outside."
276,4.0,"They said it's 6th largest museum in the world...while the collections can't compare with that of Louve or the British Museum, etc. but the architure is contemporary and nice.Permanent exhibitions are free in terms of admission. budget 2 hours if you are going."
277,5.0,"I had an absolutely fantastic time at the National Museum. It's a large and elegant, modern building with a huge collection of Korean and Asian artefacts, including several national treasures. I went on a free English guided tour at 10:30am - I was the only person, so I had a one-on-one with a lovely volunteer guide. We spent an hour looking at 10 of the museum's most precious Korean pieces. Afterwards I wandered through at my own pace and took photographs. Then I spent quite a bit of money at the museum shop, and enjoyed a good lunch at the excellent food court.Up until this point I'd felt slightly indifferent to Korea's pre-war history, but I could really see at the museum how unique and precious the culture is."
278,4.0,"Clean, well organised museum. Easy to get to from subway. Nice cafe/restraunt as well which is reasonalbly priced. Took the free guided tour which was really helpful. Would definitely recommend a visit"
279,5.0,"Knowing a nations past and seeing how their ancient culture was provides a glimpse of how they have evolved to the culture they have today. They had a well lit facility, with a variety of departments to walk into. They had a vast amount of artifacts that you could take pictures of and as well headsets in case ou needed a guided self tour. This is definitely a must if you are a history fanatic."
280,4.0,"really big and very modern building, designed to show Korea's cultural treasures. A must see in Seoul"
281,5.0,"Lovely architectural space, with huge exhibits showcasing Korea's history and art and artifacts. Particularly liked the painting galleries, as well as the porcelain collection. A really nice way to while a morning away."
282,3.0,"Coming from Paris, I know I have high expectations when it comes to museums.  I also know Korea has a very rich history, as rich as Japan and China.  But I do not think this museum does justice to what Korea has to offer culturally.  The collections fall short of impressing people in general and the English explanations are often incomprehensible unless you have a great knowledge into Korean history.  As for the display, I think they could have added more creative touches but they tried to be on the safe side and it shows."
283,5.0,"I went here several times while in Korea, and always saw something new.  The displays are great, there are eating establishments that are very nice (and affordable) in the downstairs, and there is a traditional tea room upstairs .  The Museum itself is relatively new, and the air conditioning is to die for in the hot months.  I also found that second to Insadong, this was the best place to pick up souvenirs for friends back home.  Very reasonably priced items are plentiful...beautiful keychains for around $6 US up to traditional arts for higher prices.  I had a suitcase full before I returned to the US!"
284,4.0,I really enjoyed this museum and learned a lot of history about Korea. It will be really boring if you are not interested in museums. I think its a great place for tourist and expats to spend a few hours. The food court is really nice too with a variety for options and its pretty affordable. You don't need a tour guide but get the electronic  guide thingy!
285,5.0,Easy to spend all day here. Very modern building. Most of the exhibits have descriptions in English. Easily accessible by subway.
286,5.0,This museum is one of the largest in the world with comprehensive displays of Korean Art and also other types of Asian Art
287,5.0,"The National Museum of Korea is extensive in its collection. Ranging from Neolithic Korea all the way to the Joseon dynasty, the museum offers a interesting guide through Korea's rich cultural history. For visitors interested in the Japanese Colonial Period or the Korean War, there are other museums that cover these era's in detail. The national museum focuses on the very ancient to the near modern (late Joseon 1910).Some of the highlights include relics from the Silla, Baekje and Goguryeo dynasties. There is a pummel of a sword from Baekje (7th century AD) that is extremely rare. The royal crown of Silla is also displayed here, the gold and jade is very beautiful. In the main concourse the Ten-Story Pagoda from Gyeongcheonsa Temple (late Goryeo), is astonishing. This national treasure was originally builit in 1348. The pagoda was illegally smuggled to Japan during the colonial period, but luckily was returned through the efforts of the American Homer Hulbert. If you would like to see even more treasures from the Three Kingdoms period specifically, a nice compliment to the National Museum of Korea is the well-known Gyeongju, Buyeo, or Gongu National Museums. As far as I know, there is no specifically designed museum soley for Goryeo relics. All three of the above mentioned museums are worth visiting. To the average visitor pottery is not the most interesting artifact (I know). The national museum has quite a collection, and browsing all of it may be tiring for some. I recommend finding a specific style and focus on that. Korea is famous for Goryeo celadon, which is often gray/green in its color. By the 12th century, the celadon produced in Korea was without equal, with the possible exception of some Song dynasty masterpieces. Advanced techniques of pottery production and kiln design was introduced during the Song dynasty (early Goryeo in Korea). Soon after Korea (Goryeo) was producing an incredible amount of exquisite works. It is also well worth your time to browse and stroll the grounds of the museum, which do hold some interesting statues and ruined sections of ancient structures. The National Museum of Korea is a great introduction into Korean culture and history. The museum is best appreciated after visiting some of Korea's major historical sites. There are comparable exhibits (smaller scale) in some of Korea's other national museums, and in the Tokyo National Museum which houses an enormous collection of Korean artifacts. Enjoy your visit to an excellent museum."
288,5.0,"The technology used, the presentation and the well kept archives.   Too many things to see and you need at least a day to truly absord and appreciate the displayed."
289,5.0,This was the first place I visited on reaching Seoul. Visiting museums is a great way of understanding the culture and people  of the country we visit which helps me to enjoy the holiday more fully.  I also liked the interesting commentary on the MP3 I rented for 1000 won.  It's a wonderful alternative too if the weather is not suitable for outdoor sightseeing.
290,5.0,"Visited the National Museum of Korea recently and was impressed by the scale of the building and quantity of artifacts within. Entrance to the permanent exhibit is free, while there is a small fee (KRW3000, ~USD2.70) for the special exhibit. Picked up a brochure from the front desk which was good enough for exploring the museum. It has a good layout of the floors, and highlights items of interest (with photos) in selected rooms. Was primarily interested in Korean historical items, and therefore targeted the 1st floor and browsed some rooms on the 3rd floor. The rooms on the 1/F can be chronologically visited starting with the ancient history on the right side, U-turning to medieval/early modern history rooms on the left side. Enjoyed the earlier Kingdoms the most; there was an excellent video in the Goguryeo room, plus found items more visually interesting in this part. Particularly in the Silla room, several artworks were individually encased for better appreciation. The Joseon rooms were a bit dry except for the maps and drawings.The 3rd floor is dedicated to Asian artworks (some are reproductions), Buddhist sculptures and metal works. Thought this floor was memorable for the many bells viewed. At the time of visitation, NMK's special exhibit was on celadon, where an extensive display of this lovely ceramic can be viewed in all forms. Note the last part of the display comprised the ""best"" of the lot, the celadon artifacts were quite elaborate and very decorative in this segment.Overall, the National Museum of Korea offers a great exhibit of historical domestic (and regional) artifacts which are well worth checking out when traveling to Seoul. This museum has a large cafeteria and extensive outside grounds too which offer a pleasant break from all the viewing. To get to NMK by metro, get off Ichon Station (Line 4) exit #2 and just keep going straight. The walk is about 10-15 minutes. Note the museum is closed on Mondays."
291,4.0,"liked the cartoon videos on korea's history, I think the idea's good as children will not feel bored w the cartoon which helped understand the stories behind the artefacts n exhibits. Guides were really friendly. Museum equipped w foodcourt, reasonable prices."
292,5.0,"The building itself is something to look at , it's a no non-sense marble edifice the whole of Korea should be proud of. The exhibits are well laid out. The Maya exhibit is eerie but beautiful. The Korean-Buddhist-Silla halls are breathtaking. Seeing the actual Silla crown is an experience. The Asian Exhibit is really worth the 3rd floor climb. The artificial lake in front is beautiful specially now in Autumn.  A must visit when in Seoul, and it's just a ride away via subway !"
293,5.0,"This is the biggest museum I've ever visited and the night I came in they also had the Mayan exhibit so it was an extra treat. I like the animated  ‘Autumn – Autumn in Art’ Exhibition Movie. Check out the Garden, pagodas, pond and waterfall before going in. You can spend a good few hours here without knowing. Expect to spend at least 4 hours."
294,5.0,"This is one heck of a museum. Walking up to it you are awarded a wonderful view of the museum. Architecturally, it is stunning. Inside there are three floors. Artifacts dating from pre-history all the way to more modern times, so to speak. There are very good English explanations. If you enjoy history you can easily spend 3-4 hours here and it's free. But be ready, it is a major tourist attraction so it can be quite noisy."
