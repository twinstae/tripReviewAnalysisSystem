1,4.0,Interesting architecture. Relatively easy to find in Itaewon. Only Muslims are allowed to enter the mosque. The person at the front door was nice enough to let us take a peek inside.

Ladies have a small section to pray on the 2nd level.Wadhu area is outside not inside. there is facility of water dispensor with cold water.there are donation box kept outside be generous and donate... even a small donation may help.I met a very helpful local who guided me. It feels so good to be there. And when we left from friday prayers there were 2 people outside the gate serving zamzam to everyone. highly recommend every Muslim visiting Seoul."

I went for Friday prayer and it was rather busy with prayer mats outside for those who couldn't fit inside the main prater hall. To take wuduk you need to go into a small cabin that is a little walk from the prayer hall, so in the winter, I would recommend going there with you wuduk ready. For females there is a special area for their wuduk.It is lovely to see such a building in a country that isn't Islamic. In England most mosques are small houses or a school hall - so to see the acceptance of Islam and the freedom to pray by the Koreans is lovely.The local area is full of halal food - so it was great to eat halal food without worrying. There is a great book store just down the road from the mosque where you can buy great Islamic books for a reasonable price!"
