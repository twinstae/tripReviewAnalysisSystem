1,5.0,"Located within close proximity to a number of other Seoul highlights including the Bukchon Hanok village and Gyeongbokgung Palace, the free-entry Korean Contemporary History museum is an outstanding lesson in the country's at-times tragic history, tracing events from the start of the twentieth century as the country opened up to the world through international trade before a series of invasions, wars, the division of the north and south, the South Korean transformation into a manufacturing powerhouse, political uprisings and cultural shifts shaped the country we know today - all of which should prove an illuminating, melancholy and fascinating journey for the interested traveller. At the time of visiting, a temporary exhibition on the two decade history of the cellular phone in South Korea proved a fascinating step back in time. For me, this museum proved revelatory as I gained some insight into the war that my uncles fought in, came to understand how the division of north and south was characterised in popular culture, and learned how younger, educated Koreans rose up against politicians determined to seize power from the people. It is one thing to visit a museum; it is another thing to be changed by the experience."

The admission to the museum is free and you can see a pretty good view of the surrounding area by going rooftop.The museum explored in details on the events in chronological order and even added the new section that honors the victims of comfort women from Japanese imperialism. It was a very personal experience for me to re-learn the contemporary history to understand my roots.Even if you are not from Korea, I highly recommend visiting this museum to get a better understanding of the modern history of South Korea!"
3,4.0,"Several other museums in Seoul tell the story of Korea from neolithic times to ""the present"" but treat the period from 1945 - 2010 briefly, if at all. This museum focuses on the 20th Century, dividing it in several periods. There is a lot on the time under Japanese rule, with a not-unexpected dark tone. The rise of modern Korea is suitably interesting and inspiring. They had 2 special exhibits in early June--the lost an unknown Korean War soldiers, and calligraphy from an early independence proponent executed by the Japanese.  The views from the roof garden of the palace and surrounding area are great and worth a visit, even if all you do is go up the elevator! The museum is free and is a nice addition to a visit to the area."
4,5.0,Very important when you visit South Korea. Do the museum on the begining of your trip so you know basicly the history of the country in the last 150 years.
5,4.0,"If you have to choose only one museum of history to go in Seoul, this is the one! It offers a good overview of the recent history since 1945, a period not covered by the National Museum of Korea and essential to better understand this country and its people. Of course the War Memorial of Korea offers a deeper dive into the war period, but if you lack time to visit both, I believe you benefit more from a visit to the National Museum of Korean Contemporary History."
6,5.0,"Located at seoul, the entrance is around p120-150. Make sure to wear your most comfortable shoes. The place is really big, you can see different kinds of birds around. You can wear hanbuk (korean traditional clothes) i think you can rent it there, I didn't tried coz it was really hot! Make sure that if you want to take a photo you avoid yourself with so many tourists. Especially chinesse (you know what im tryna say)ðŸ˜¡ luckily i had spots that they're not visible so that i can take a pictures without them pushing or blocking me. Haha bitter lang!ðŸ˜‚"
7,5.0,"Admission to the museum is free.  A place to understand what has happened to Korea in the last 100 years.  We did the JSA & DMZ tour before going to this museum.  If you are doing the JSA & DMZ tour, you may consider visiting this museum to learn about this history beforehand.  Really wish the Korean can be united in peace."
8,5.0,This museum continues to get better and better :-) i love the content and the set up and it's a perfect place to know more about Korean modern history. It's free and easy to find as it is right next to the American embassy at gwanghamun station. Please enjoy this great museum
9,4.0,"Foreigners are often treated to elaborate displays of traditional korean culture (from hanbok to old palaces to kimchi-making...). All interesting in their own rights, but not reflecting where Koreans truly come from and what growing up in Korea felt like.First of all, the museum is perfectly located on Gwangwhamun, and is in a nice looking building, though not overly visually impressive. The exhibition rooms though benefit from neat displays, interactive features, balanced lightning, that bring extra value to the whole experience. The museum is very interested, especially considering that it focuses on modern history and economic development. The cutoff point is 1945 (from the end of the Japanese Occupation). It's a great 2 to 3-hour journey through the troubled yet fascinating history of Korea. Since ""understanding"" is more important than ""viewing"" in a contemporary history museum, I wish everything was translated in English 100%. Some of it is, some isn' t, which is a bit of a shame since the the place opened in 2012. Finally, the museum tends a bit to elude parts of history that the country isn't fully comfortable with, such as how Japanese occupation (despite its atrocities) might have help jump-start the korean economy, or the lack of liberties through the history of Korea through 1987. Despite the lack of emphasis on these difficult moments, the museum still feels really relevant and is a must-go for any one interested in modern korean history"
