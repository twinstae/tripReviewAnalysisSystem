We saw lots of food and clothes stalls, people jogging and riding bike, having a picnic and basically spend leisurely time with their family and they looked so happy hahaha. To be honest, one of my travel to-do list is to ride a bike in this park, but we couldn't do that. Will definitely come back for the experience!"
1,5.0,"This is a nice riverside park along Han River for picnics or a stroll. This park is near Yeouinaru Station. When you exit the station, there is a convenience store and some stalls selling instant ramen and fried chicken. Many locals set up tents and spent the evening here. There are also bicycles for rental.  We enjoyed the park as the weather was good."
2,4.0,"Came here by Yeouinaru Station.Didn't expect it to be so crowded on the weekends. The place are filled with tents and more people are coming in continuously when we left. Really nice to have gatherings with family and friends having a picnic and enjoying the breeze. The queue for ramyeon are super long and crazy. There are also bicycle for rental which we didn't go for.The weather was really nice with the cold winds plus the sun helping to warm the place. Went on a motorised duck boat ride which it wasn't what I had imagined to be as the river was kind of not so calm that day. Only went on 2 big rounds and we surrendered.Bought a kite to fly for around 4,000 won and we really enjoyed ourselves doing so for at least an hour. Flying a kite here was really effortless without much running to get it up and flying cause the wind was really strong! Despite the sun, we stayed at this place for at least 3 hours.Good place to have a picnic here!"

4,5.0,"This is a really nice riverside park of Hangang(Han River). Good to visit and chill.- Metro #5 Yeonaru is the closest station. It's also nice walking from Yeouido Station through Yeouido Park.- Since it's a huge area, riding a bicycle is really popular.- You can also try Eland Cruise.- It's very windy until March. Be prepared with enough clothes."

9,4.0,"big empty space for kids to cycle and move around, hot in the day time best to go only at night. go if you want to relax without anything exciting."

15,4.0,"There's a reason this place draws crowds (especially in the Spring time). It's a wonderful place to take a stroll, walk your dog, or just lie out and enjoy the short window of time when the sun isn't too strong and it's not too cold out."

17,4.0,"Overall the location is easily accesible via subway (yeouinaru station - line 5), directly above the station.There is a convenience store right at the entrance for those wanting to try having a DIY ramyun meal while enjoying the hangang park view.Nothing much but a good place to just sit and relax or if you have a bike, the place is designed with bicycle lanes for bikers."
18,4.0,"Visited with 50+ school kids in the start of winter!! Clear, cold and stunning! A great place to hang out, ride bikes, walk the riverbank, play in the gardens among statues, gardens, paths and big lawned areas. Sculptures, fountains, stunning views of the city and bridges. Boats on the river were preparing for night cruises with christmas decorations and lights but the cafes happily served food and drinks to us all. Due ti the cold, there were not big crowds so we had the place pretty much to ourselves, however it can be crowded. Beautiful views up and down the river and across to the city, Definate stop in Seoul."
19,5.0,This is one of Seoul's best picnic spots. What is most enjoyable is the little man-made stream thay runs along the park and the open swimming pool. Its a great retreat for children and adults as well and I always feel Han river looks its best from this spot.
20,5.0,"Having my korean family in Seoul, i can only recommend a Han river cruise at sunset to see Seoul skyline and the bridge with the fountains !"
21,5.0,"I purposely choose this park to visit in April since it held the biggest cherry blossom festival in Seoul during spring. To reach there, take Subway Line 9, and alight at National Assembly Station, Exit 1 (the nearest to walk to the park). The cherry blossom trees are everywhere, along the road near the National Assembly building. It was very crowded with visitor during this time of the month, since the scenery here was really amazing & lovely and makes every photos turn out good! Unlike in Japan, they don't have snack stall or place to picnic (hanami) here, so the atmosphere is different from Japan, it more Korean styles of enjoying the cherry blossom. However, it was still very memorable Cherry Blossom experience in South Korea."
22,4.0,"Lovely park. Although most trees were bare in winter, you can still see some with red autumn leaves. There is a beautiful pond which is partially frozen. The park is clean and great for walking. Toilets are clean too. In fact there are two parks joined by a tunnel. One is nearer to the Han river, while the other part is nearer to the commercial area. In the one nearer to the Commercial area (get down at National Assembly station), there is an ice park. You can do ice skating (payable) or sledding (payable) or just play with the artificial snow(at the moment) for free. Small food stalls are set up."
23,5.0,"Its fun with kids and family or friends. Bring lots of food to eat, mat , book and enjoy with fresh air and surroundings."
24,5.0,We took bikes and cycled along the Han River until we went to find some fried chicken and stopped to sit and have a picnic. It was lovely to ride in the late afternoon and experience the sunset view alongside the river. It was the best thing to do to finish off our trip in Seoul
25,5.0,A good place to relax. Your kids would enjoy it. The place is open with lots of activities that can be done. Neat and clean. Plus you can go on a ferry ride.
26,5.0,We went there on a Saturday during the Cherry blossom festival - was quite crowded but worth a visit during the beautiful cherry blossom days
27,5.0,"This is anothet park closed to the hotel I am staying. It's reall nice with great view over the river and city. Lot of people go there for picnic and cycling. There are washroom, playground, cruise. Should visit it if you are in the area."
28,5.0,"We went in the morning by subway. As it was not too hot, we rented bicycles and cycled for an hour along the Hangang river. It was very fun. There were amenities like playgrounds and toilets along the park. It would be nice to pack some food and have a picnic there."
29,5.0,It is a park alongside the Hang River and it is a great place to chill. Many Koreans went there to picnic and tourist and rent a bike and enjoy the bike ride in the park. You can go for a boat trip too but I think its not special and its not a wow factor for me. The park is very big so you can spent half day in there to chill and relax.
30,5.0,"We visited during the the Cherry blossom festival or the flower festival as they call it. This was from April 4th 2016 to April 10th. Breathtaking view of the Han River plus endless rows of cherry blossom tress in full bloom, what a sight to behold. Priceless for those who love to see the tress at their best bloom."
31,5.0,"Water fountains and man made streams to play in, views of the river. Bicycles to rent and grass to sit. What more do you need on a sunny afternoon."
32,3.0,"If you've come all this way to Korea you'll want to find yourself something else to do because, as lovely as Yeouido Hangang Park may be, it doesn't deviate far from other average parks around the world. If you're a local looking for a relaxing time then by all means this park is more than decent. However, the disappointment of the city skyline - or a lack thereof - and you've got yourself a park that doesn't prove to be a good visit for tourists."
33,5.0,The open park along the river would bring join to anyone in your family. Me & my daughter spent whole morning here as we rent 2 bikes (with helmets) & cycled along the river. The rental fee was very reasonable & you can see most of Yeouido landscape from the river bank.
34,4.0,"Nice and pretty place in a spring season, you can see a lot of cherryblossom .. you can also find many traditional foods, but difficult to find Halal foods (for moslem)"
