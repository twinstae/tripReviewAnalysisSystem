5,5.0,"Very beautiful campus, especially the front gate.Or I can't say it is 'gate', because there is no gate!Very wide and open front!And the steps are astonishing also.Very worth to see and visit inside the campus.非常漂亮的校園，尤其是正門，或許我不該說這是正門，因為這面根本沒有門。校園前方非常廣且寬闊！且校園裡面的階梯也非常壯觀。非常值得一去！"
6,4.0,This place is justifiably popular to visit due to its beautiful architecture. Most people ignore the museum which is small but has a good collection of art and historical artifacts and is free to visit. I have never seen a university that looks like this one.
7,4.0,"You feel like you're in old Europe and a 21st century futuristic location all at the same time. Enjoyable to stroll around, no entry charge. Lots of studently priced shops and eateries nearby"
8,4.0,"There were a lot of people when I came, students and tourists alike. I wish I went to school here. Looks really nice. The garden is nice as well, but I got really tired going up and going up the stairs to. after a few snaps, I just went around Ewha. But really, it's a nice place. The structure and everything about the school looks rad."
9,5.0,"I went to visit a few years ago mainly to check out the building designed by Dominique Perrault. The campus is nice to stroll around. There is also a museum which is worth a visit.  The university gift shop stocks up some nice items, in case you are interested. I went this time to get some gifts for a friend/family. There are cheap eats at the food court, and also some nice cafes.  This time, I noticed there is an arthouse cinema too. Well worth a visit if you are in Seoul."
10,5.0,"Each time I visited Seoul, my itinerary would include the university as it had a beautiful setting, with youthful students. The campus has beautiful cherry blossoms in late early April and golden Ginkgo leaves in early Oct. As usual there are many tourists particularly in the afternoons."
11,4.0,Very beautiful campus. The scenery and the architecture was wonderful. Beautiful to take several photos.
12,1.0,"This place is a University, not a Zoo or something. You should not go inside, unless you gonna do gentle. Please be quiet and just walk around outside of buildings. That`s all you can do. This place is not a place for tourists."
13,5.0,"Visited the Ewha Women's University to check out the architecture (which was really nice) but was also pleasantly surprised by the whole area! Lots of shops, cafe, restaurants around the area which you can go to and spend your day there. Particulary enjoyed the shopping as they had many interesting stuff which I didn't see at other parts of the city.This has got to be one of my most favourite spots to hang out in Seoul!"
14,5.0,Appreciate both the modern architecture and past.  University canteen is open to the public.  Outside you'll see food cards and a lot of shopping stalls.Good to visit in autumn.  Drop by the University museum as well.
15,5.0,Visiting this university during autumn can make you decide that it is not a bad idea to pursue your education here because the really beautiful campus is such a conducive place to study! The entire campus can give you such happiness that I can't describe in words. Must visit!

21,4.0,Nice area to walk around in with many stores and places to eat. Quite easy to get to by the mrt or just by foot.
22,4.0,"It is a very gorgeous and elegant campus. The campus is close to subway station, short walking distance. On the way to the campus, many retail shops and street food vendors!!! Cheap & yummy snacks~When I arrived at the campus, I couldn't tell I was in Korea because the architecture of the building is so European to me. They have nice cafe & book store on campus too."
23,5.0,"Aesthetically pleasing to visit! Lots of people around the area, the university is no different from a touristy landmark. The college buildings are amazing to look at. And the campus is close to lots of shops and brand name outlets. A one-stop center for all women needs, that is for sure. If you are looking for cosmetics, clothing and street food (not forget to mention a number of coffee shops with instagram-worthy design), this is the place. All said goods and services are priced from low- to high-ranged price. Definitely a safe place to visit as a female solo traveler - but of course, use your common senses no matter what. I went there as the winter is transitioning into spring - GORGEOUS. Visit, just visit!"
24,5.0,"I recommend to visit this place at night. Search for the lit architecture and take a picture, it's definitely beautiful! Outside of this university is one great shopping area especially for women - a lot of cheap finds."
25,4.0,Ewha university has few nice places where you can take nice photos. A plenty of restaurants and shops available for shopping / dinning. A good place to visit during your Seoul stay.
26,4.0,"Edae is a must-see place in Seoul. You can check out the Artbox (stationery/cute goods store) right outside the station. As you walk towards the university, there are also lots of shops along the main road and stores with cheap, trendy clothes if you walk into the streets (mostly for women). This is a great place to photograph. I went in the beginning of May so the flowers had just bloomed. There are lots of restaurants and coffee shops around to choose from. I ate at an awesome shabu shabu restaurant hidden up the hills. & there's an Auntie Anne's nearby! (I love pretzels.)"
27,5.0,Spend an hour or two in the campus walking around and end up shopping at the shopping street before having a cup of coffee nearby.
28,4.0,I always saw this campus through Korea shows and wanted to come for a look. Glad that I came because the buildings are so interesting. I didn't get to walk around for a long time because it rained when I got there. Definitely come with someone so they can help you take some good pictures!
29,4.0,"The campus is, in a word, stunning, and close to the famous Ewha Women's Shopping Street. It is a good place for a stroll to appreciate the architecture on display. Green and well maintained. The terrain is quite hilly so be prepared."
30,5.0,"I walked outside the area of the library and the main church. the campus is huge but very clean and impressive with the little green areas. The entrance of the library makes a great place for pictures. When you visit this area, you will notice the the shopping area nearby. And this is an absolute must place to visit for those women who love shopping for bargains and deals. Most of the items vary between 5.000-15.000 WON. I literally spend an entire 8 hours here with my friend shopping around."
31,3.0,"Spent about 30 minutes inside the campus to admire the architecture, which is beautiful. It has a nicely manicured garden great for pictures. Huge number of clothing, shoes and accessories shops outside the campus. Lots of street food and cafes in the area too."
32,5.0,"incredible campus to walk around or play games in the grass, recommend walking up and down the street just in front of the uni for food, snacks, bubble tea, and cool little clothing shops."
33,4.0,The campus is large and hilly.  It has interesting building structures that one can browse around. It is about 5-10 mins walk from the subway station
34,3.0,"There are a few pretty buildings and the campus ground is well maintained.  Nothing stunning, just a small university."
35,4.0,"When here after Hong dae and like this place better, although there is not so much performance but the shopping and food is nicer and cheaper..."
36,5.0,"I'm slightly biased, having worked here back in the day, but the Edae campus is positively gorgeous in the spring and autumn, rivaling Kyunghee University in its foliage. The impressive 'Gash"" carved through what used to be the Lover's Hill in the middle of the campus is definitely to be seen. In the nearby Edae/Shinchon area is the usual gamut of cosmetic/ coffee/ café shops you'd expect wherever young women congregate."
37,4.0,"The architecture of the campus is amazing. So many beautiful buildings. A hidden gem indeed. Nice place to visit and walk around (I went in the morning during classes, I did not stay too long to avoid bothering students, teachers and people studying and working there).Also during Autumn the landscapes were even more enchanting. They have nice shops inside, where you can buy nice stuff from the University.Also the surrounding area is nice to visit, good restaurants and good shops."
38,5.0,Nice architecture of the buildings and has a good atmosphere for studying. It was a huge area and nice view and really relaxing to walk around.
39,5.0,"The first time I visited in sunny weather. What a spacious old college style, with precious woods and glamorous buildings. I took a relaxing walk under sunshine. Advise to go in early morning with fewer or even no visitors. The only thing that made me feel unpleasant is the signage at main entrance appealing the Mainland China visitors not to photo on the students, and I opine it is discriminating to Chinese travelers for all."
40,2.0,"It is a university for the women, and although it was constructed back in the day, but I personally cannot find any reason to visit this place. It's not beautiful. Just plain university."
41,4.0,I wandered around on a hot day. There was a nice museum at the entrance. I enjoyed the old buildings. You don't get many in a European style in Korea. 
42,5.0,"the best ever for me, the university is very beautiful landmark! near to the university have different cosmetic shop, if you dont like myeongdong, you can come to ewha, plenty of the coffee shop also right here. "
43,4.0,"It was a lovely area, lively, packed with young people...A relaxed area with trees, which I guess you won't notice if you are a girl and a sopping addict :-) You can pack up on cheap young fashion, make-up and accessories, or just explore and have a cup of coffee or grab a bit."
44,3.0,"University area is beautiful and lovely. Both old and new buildings are impressive. Shopping area looks nice from the first sight, but once you enter any shop, shop assistants are prone to follow your every step, watch you all the time, ""advice"" you what you should pay attention"
45,4.0,"Great shopping area!Affordable and quality clothing, bag and accessories.Easy to access by the subway.Nice place to walk around and cafe hop as well."
46,5.0,"I like this place because they have a beautiful building. So, I can get a lot of nice photo here and around here is good place for shopping and I think some stuffs is quite cheaper than others place."
47,5.0,"Although this was noticed not to be accessed by others except students, this was still opened for tourist to take the flower pictures in quiet. If you want to take some flowers and old building, you should come and don't miss the food outside the University, many hawker with Korean BBQ and other traditional Korean food are waiting for you."
48,3.0,"within the university quarter, the university is set in a 'young' place in a traditional background. Good point to take photo."
49,5.0,"one of subway stop for shopping as there a lot of shops nearby the university.there are many snacks stall around there as well, so you can eat and shop til you drop !"
50,4.0,I find the place quaint and pleasing to the eye. There were also a lot of shops lining the streets going to the university and most are really affordable clothing stores for women. I bought a couple of shoes and bags there and they were cheaper than those in Hongik University.
51,5.0,The campus is a perfect mix of modern and traditional architecture. The roof garden at the student lecture hall at the front is a great design. The traditional buildings remind you of Oxford or Cambridge. I can imagine why students would enjoy studying here.
52,5.0,"The area is like a shopping haven for women. Whatever you need, it is all here. I managed to get a whole outfit here, from head to toe with bag. And it is really cheap. Unlike dongdaemun with marked up prices, the prices seems okay here. (Top average about 10,000won and shoes at 20,000won)Contact lenses are at a affordable price too and even my hair dyed (chest length at only 40,000won!)(I got lucky though. Most chest length charge 70,000won).Most of the restaurants here are western/korean fusion food. The street offer pretty nice food actually !I recommend everyone (especially women) to come here!"
53,3.0,"Interesting shopping and some street food around. The campus is pretty as well, but the shopping gets more attention ;)"
54,4.0,"The campus is beautiful (the library is particularly fascinating with its glass wall and overall architecture) and would be more so with the autumn foliage (I was early by a few weeks) so I would suggest going there in November for the best view. There has been news that the university has requested for a ban from entries for tourists due to the disturbance they have caused (some daring enough to hold their wedding photography on the grounds of the campus) so do drop by soon, if you think the request holds true.Apart from the university, most tourists will also cover the area of shops around Ewha as it offers some of the best bargains. I've spotted items selling in Ewha for about half of what was quoted in Hongdae. However, accessories (some claimed to be hand-made, but I've seen replicates of other items elsewhere so I'm not too sure if I believe them) sold weren't very cheap. For the guys, fret not, there are plenty of shops catered to male shoppers even though Ewha is an all-women university. All in all, it's a good place to rewind if you have planned some hectic days, earlier in your itinerary."
55,4.0,"I was here during winter, it was bitter cold, however there was just so much to shop here, I just couldn't stop.And if you are like me, who is coming to Seoul during winter, just bring along one thicker jacket and your empty luggage and head to Ewha Womans University straight after you landed at the airport because the winter wear here is definitely stylish, good and cheap! You could get a decently warm jacket with beautiful design at less than 30000KRW! I bought very cute, peter-pan collared, a long-sleeved blouse for only 7000KRWI think, in a way, I was lucky not to have came by during spring or summer, if not, I believe I would go home exceeding twice my baggage allowance."
56,5.0,"I found the nicest accessories in my entire Seoul trip from the shops in this area especially from a little shop called Kiss Diamond. Although the designer/owner and I had communication problems, her creations are unique and beautiful. Prices were reasonable too."
57,4.0,"This museum was interesting, neatly arranged, very enjoyable, and admission was free. It is a small museum though, so it doesn't take much time to get through. There are a lot of great stores near by, so I would definitely recommend making a trip to the area."
58,5.0,"The campus is beautiful and with the manicured lawns and gardens it makes a nice oasis compared with the busy shops very close by. I was impressed by the classrooms they have under the grassy hill, an ingenious innovation in architecture, juxtaposed with the impressive older buildings above the hill area. A great place to take a breather in between the shops."
59,4.0,"If you are ever in Seoul and run out of mainstream places to visit, definitely drop by here. You will see local students and the most beautiful campus in Seoul. You can also walk around the area and maybe go to the nearby Hongdae if you come at night for a nightlife, but if you come during the day, just walking around the campus is a good experience!"
