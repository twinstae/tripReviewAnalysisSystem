0,5.0,"The Nanta is a fun show that I believe would appeal to most people. Comedy, good beats, fun theme, and even a bit of action and romance."
1,5.0,"The actors were so full of energy and the entire performance was such a unique experience. It was funny and easy to understand even if you do not speak Korean. I watched it alone as I was on a solo trip, but I had such an amazing time. Definitely recommending this to everyone who goes to Seoul."
2,3.0,"It's ""okay"".... watch if you need something to do to kill time.Too busy and chaotic. Prefer more performance and less monkeying around."
3,4.0,I went to watch the show alone and thoroughly enjoyed it! I think it’s great for adults and also children so a good all rounder. Lots it’s crowd participation so you never get bored. The only issue I had was in finding the theatre. It’s located above the Innisfree store on the 3rd floor but the instructions that I received in the email were not very clear to follow or accurate. I ended up arriving late and missing the first 10 minutes so I advise any tourists to leave yourself a lot of time in case you get lost like me! Once you finally do make it there though it’s worth it.
4,4.0,Recommended to everyone even if doesn't know Korean. Really interesting and shouldn't be missed out!
5,5.0,"Not so obvious to found, just ask people there for directions.I advise you preorder on the internet 2 months ago for discount 30% up. Buying ticket in the same day is in original price and is much more expensive. Even the day before it is cheaper 10%.建議先在網路上預訂，幾個月前預訂可以到接近半價的價格。甚至前一天在飯店用ｗｉｆｉ都可以有九折。當天買就是原價了很貴。"
6,4.0,"It is on the 2nd floor of a building on a busy shopping street. Sign is not very easily spotted if you looking on the ground floor, you have to look up on the buildings. Taxi can't get to the street directly so find the closest street to have them drop you off. The show is fun and very entertaining for all ages. a good size theater with lots of seating. I won't buy the top price ticket, the 2nd or 3rd choices are good enough and still have good view of the show. If you don't like noise then this might not be the show for you."
7,5.0,"The show was great.  So entertaining,  funny, excellent attraction, good interaction with the audience and they are a great performer. No need to worry if cant speak korean,  because you will still understand and laugh (i dont speak korean but still can laugh). There is a limited seat for each performance.  Better you book the ticket online, because i did and get a discount to book online from nanta official website.  On the day of the show just show your voucher to the ticket box to get the ticket."
8,5.0,"The show itself was great, and I'm glad I went. The theater itself is a little older, but still a nice and intimate space. Would definitely recommend splurging a little to get the better seats on the floor if you can. Since it's wordless, there's no real language barrier, and slapstick works well with everyone, kids to older adults. Go see this show!"
9,1.0,Great place but staff have a hostile attitude towards tourists. A show that supposed to reflect the amazing culture of Korean people is ruined by such unprofessional and aggressive staff. What a shame.
10,5.0,"Very happy I caught this show! If you like percussion and funny gag style humor, then this is a must see! This show mixes together great korean cultural humor with innovative percussion techniques and instruments! One sequence was of a 3 drum korean traditional set but with water bottles and unconventional drums. No korean needed to enjoy the show. They should work on the gift shop items available as I wanted a keepsake, but I didn’t find anything good in the drumming/cooking souvenirs."
11,4.0,"Bring your ear plugs to stay safe and comfortable. Stil a very funny, dynamic, and impressive performance!"
12,5.0,"Great energy and very funny show, you will not be disappointed.The music is great and the story is funny and crowd participation is well timed to certain scenes without being awkward.I arrived there and followed Naver map to the location, it is in myeongdong street where they food stalls there, ao maybe bring some cash to have a little snack before going in, they do not allow food inside."
13,5.0,"I had such an amazing time at this show! Really entertaining and transcends all language barriers. If you are in Seoul, don't miss this!"
14,5.0,"I was looking for something to do in the evening and stumbled upon discount tickets for this show - I bought them despite only knowing that it was a ""comedy cooking show""It was brilliant. There is a loose storyline that is introduced at the start (in English, Korean, Chinese and Japanese) but the majority of the show takes place without using language which makes it super universal and easy to enjoy. There is a lot of incredible drumming using a variety of cooking equipment and the storyline is hilarious."
