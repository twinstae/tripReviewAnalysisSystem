2,4.0,"The Dongdaemun area is a good place to shop for cheap, good quality finds. It is also where the Doota mall and duty free is located where products are discounted. Lots of cheap stalls inside the shopping complex. Dongdaemun is also where the Dongdaemun Design Plaza is located - a very unique building (one of a kind architectural design) which consists of a design gallery, art gallery, etc."
3,3.0,So this place is a huge area where people seem to just hang around - maybe its part of the Korean life. There are the ruins and wall here which jut out and there are also unusually designed chairs. People sit there or they even just lie there in public and chit chat with their friends. A bit unusual for me to see. It was a rainy day so it wasn't much fun for us.
4,5.0,The building has a very unique ufo like shape. We went here at night and its situated next to the LED rose park. The scenery was magnificant.
