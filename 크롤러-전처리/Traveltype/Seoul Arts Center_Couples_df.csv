0,1.0,Tried to book a ticket but apparently they donâ€™t like non resident foreigners. To book you need to become member and membership is only allowed for Koreans and resident foreigners. This is actually pure discrimination and a shame for the beautiful and friendly Korea.
1,5.0,"The Seoul Arts Center is a large complex that offers exhibitions, musicals and other art events. It is comprised of several buildings and also offers some cafes and restaurants. To get there is very easy via bus or taxi, the nearest subway station is Nambu.English language is a challenge there as it is not so much a tourist hot spot and mainly frequented by locals, however the people there are not unkind as some other contributors stated."
2,1.0,"It is one of the best exhibitions in Korea. It is terribly unkind. It is worse than Paris, famous for being unkind."
3,4.0,"I've been to this center many times. If you keep an eye on their website, they will get very interesting exhibits. They have had a Studio Ghibli, Steam Punk, Impressionist Art (Van Gogh), and Freida Kahlo in just the last four years. The musical performances are also good, but you might need a Korean friend to help you get tickets."
4,5.0,Huge by any standards.Very impressive series of complexes covering a vast area.Important for holding shows of all artistic types
5,5.0,Easily accessible by the Metro the Arts Centre is a collection of Performing Centres. We attended the Concert hall which inside had similar character to Sydney Opera House to listen to Korean Symphony Orchestra. A great concert and the Choir for Beethoven's 9th were supberb.
6,5.0,"Fantastic building, with over 2 milloin visitors a year. It houses the Opera house, Music Hall and has over 2 million visitors each year. It houses the Hangaram Art Museum with Korean  culture and its diverse exhibitions of international scale. A must visit if one i interested in the highly interesting culture South Korea has to offer."
7,5.0,"There are so many thing to see here. We went to hear a symphony and our seats were fantastic. They bring in some amazing artists and it is worth it for you to look at their schedule (some English available, and we bought our tickets easily online and picked up at will-call) to attend something here. The subway stops very close to the center, so it is very accessible. Our program ended at 10:30 pm, but the subway is pretty crowded until around midnight, so it was very safe for us to take the 30 minute journey back to our hotel."
8,4.0,"SAC has a lot for you if you are interested in arts, visiting museums, music etc.We made two visits: the first one during daytime and the second one late evening...due the fact that we wanted to enjoy the World Musical Fountain in two ways. The fountain is one of the few in the world which is syncronized with music played through loudspeakers and it is absolutely magnificent. It is lighted up with colourful lights during a dark evening."

10,4.0,"You know what? The place is awesome. The problem I have is that people - especially in Asia - are not willing to go and listen to classical music any more recent than, say, Beethoven. Any living composer can forget it. It's all about Tchaikovsky's Overture, Beethoven's 9th, Mozart's Requiem. Rachmaninoff, Bach, Handel. Come on, people! Live a little and try something new!My experience of SAC is largely ruined by the fact that there's nothing to actually experience other than I guess people trying to be upper class. Try some Charles Ives, Thomas Ades, Varese, even John Adams or Steve Reich. Then I'll 5 star the place."
11,4.0,The koreans love their orchestra and other art performances. The place is a very nice and quiet place. Its definitely worth a visit. Check out the fountain too.
12,4.0,"A respite from the hustle and bustle of city streets, SAC (its nickname) is a large complex on the southern edge of Seoul backed up against a wooded mountain that's a bit hard to reach (need to take a mini-bus for 5 minutes from the nearest subway, Nambu Bus terminal station) but if you have tickets to a concert, opera, musical or whatnot, try and come early to savour the atmosphere and stroll about the grounds. They've built up the area to include a myriad of cafes and restaurants, so you could in theory have dinner and coffee before an evening show (but probably not after; they don't stay open late if my memory serves me...) They may also have some art exhibits, and there's a traditional music institute on the premises that might display some instruments. It also has authentic traditional Korean musical performances at reasonable prices (much better than the downtown tourist shows..), so inquire into that if that's your thing. You will find some English speaking staff at the main building, and overall a sophisticated cultured (i.e., ""well-dressed"") crowd comes here so if you don't want to turn heads you should dress it up a bit."
13,5.0,"Speaking of creativity, Seoul Arts Center would be the hub of them all. Artistic architecture building from the outside is enough to lure us in to view the quiet & glamorous interiors. We were awe by the creative product display, paintings & sculptures. Even a florist shop was so beautiful in there. A place where you can fuel your mind with creativity at ease. (well that works for me, what about you?)"
14,5.0,"Great place to spend a few hours...or a day! You can Google the current exhibitions, but it's worth a visit anyway. Lovely outdoor area with food/drink stalls. Didn't see any other travellers there, so quite nice to be there amongst the locals. Took us a while to find our way there by subway so look into that before you set off!"
