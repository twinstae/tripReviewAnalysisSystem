0,4.0,It's in the middle of a busy square full of cars. So it's good to see it when you are just passing by and catch a quick photo.
1,4.0,"This is a reconstructed version of one of the original Seoul gates and a lovely one, at that. Probably not worth a trip, but when in the area, worth passing by."
2,4.0,Right next to Namdaemun market. I love that it’s randomly in the middle of quite a busy intersection. Stands magnificently. We saw the changing of the guards. There are toilets near by.
3,4.0,"There’s not a whole lot to do here but it’s worth checking out if you’re close by.  I always like seeing some cool architecture and learning some history while travelling.  From what I remember from the plaque... the King came to pray at this gate during times of drought.What you’ll discover when you’re there it is super clean and well maintained.  There is no fee to enter.  There is a changing of the guard ceremony at certain times which may have a fee, not sure."
4,3.0,"Sungnyemung Gate , often known as Namdaemun Gate is listed as Treasure Number One in Korea, but it was partially destroyed by fire in 2008 and renovated since then. Tgis gate was the south entrance of the city wall."
5,4.0,"It's unfortunate that due to the history of S Korea alot of its historical structures and monuments have been rebuilt and it's no different (though for slightly different reasons) for the gate also known as Namdaemun gate which was destroyed by an arsonist some years back. It's one of the most memorable sights when arriving into the city from the airport as it's at a roundabout. Don't think other gates are open like this is so it was nice to walk through it and pose for pictures with the guards dressed in historic outfits. For kdrama fans, the gate featured in a few scenes from Chicago Typewriter :) If you had to pick one fortress gate to visit in Seoul you can't go wrong with Sungnyemun."
6,3.0,This historical gate is in the middle of a busy part of the city. We saw the changing of the guard from a distance and the guards were dressed in very colourful traditional uniforms. Later on we went to the gate for a closer look. It has a colourful painting on the underside of the archway and there is a sign which gives the history of the gate. An interesting place to quickly stop by if you are in the area.
7,3.0,"The gate is relatively tourist free and you can get some good pictures when visiting, however there isn’t much to do here.If you are going to the nearby market, then it’s worth a minor detour.   But it’s not somewhere to go out of your way to see."
8,3.0,"Easy to find and located at a major intersection near Namdaemun Market.It is one of the Eight Gates in the Fortress Wall of Seoul, South Korea, which surrounded the city in the Joseon dynasty. The gate is located in Jung-gu between Seoul Station and Seoul Plaza, with the historic 24-hour Namdaemun market next to the gate. Entry is free and the gate is closed on Mondays.Destroyed by fire in 2008, 5 years restoration followed with it reopening in 2013.We visited on a Monday, not sure what the benefits of it being ""open"" would be, but regardless, a brief visit is all that is necessary."
9,4.0,"This historical site is easy to find as it is located in the cross section of a main road. It is also next the popular Namdaemun Market. There is nothing much to see and explore. I would suggest a 30 mins visit would be sufficient to take in the sight. While we were there in the morning at 9 am, we were the only visitors. Recommendation : to throw in this visit while on your way to Namdaemun Market."
10,4.0,We stopped at Hoehyeon station and visited this attraction. It is near the Namdaemun market and Namsan park.  We saw some colourful guards here. The roundabout near here is very busy.  It is quite beautiful.  This place is free to visit.
11,4.0,This is an impressive structure and one of the 8 gates of the City.  it stands in the middle of a big round about so vehicles are constantly driving about.  Not far from Seoul Main station and the Nadaemun Night Market.  This gate is also known as Nadaemun Gate so can be found easily by taxi.  15 mins from City Hall Metro station which is the closest metro.Only 7 more to go :)
12,3.0,"It's indeed mind-blowing to think that you are standing in front of a structure that originated from 1396 during the beginning of the Joseon Dynasty. Although the structure is no longer original and has been restored numerous times over the centuries (most recently in 2008 after an arson attack), this National Treasure No. 1 is still worth a quick 15 minutes visit before you move on to the Namdaemun or Namsan attractions."
13,4.0,We used this gate more of a landmark to find our hotel.  It was very pretty all lit up at night.  The surrounding small park closes at 6pm though.
14,4.0,"If you are in the area, then sure head towards the gate. Other than walk through the arch and gaze up at the gate there is nothing else to do here. There were a few ceremonial guards there on a Saturday, but if you have been to the palaces you will have lots of better photos. Nice gate yes and maybe one that has to be visited so the box can be ticked."
15,4.0,This is an amazing historic landmark in Seoul and is popular for tourists to visit. We were very impressed with how beautifully maintained it is for its age. There are also tours offered which are helpful for understanding the gate's historic significance.
16,3.0,"Sungnyemun,  崇禮門, meaning Gate of Exalted Ceremonies, is one of the 8 Gates in the Fortress Wall of Seoul which serve to protect the city in the Joseon dynasty.  In was built in the 14th Centre by King Taejo. The gate is located just between Seoul Station (10 mins walk) and Seoul Plaza, with the 24-hour Namdaemun market just nearby at the eastern side. Lesser hype than its counterpart the East Gate (Heunginjimon), it is still as marvel.  With the lesser tourist horde we got to spend more time and taking better pictures (minus the human and vehicular traffic)! The city gate is made of wood and stone with a two-tiered, pagoda-shaped tiled roof.  It was recently restored after arson damaged large part of it.  While magnificence it lost much of its authenticity/originality (looks “new” instead)!. Then again it sure looks grand.by day and simply impressive at night. Sungnyemun’s tablet has its name written vertically.While in Japan we go Castle-hunting here in Korea we go Gate-visiting, haha.I will recommend one to visit if you are somewhere nearby – 숭례문 Gate!"
17,4.0,This is a beautiful and massive gate built several centuries ago. There is a panel which summarizes its main events. It has an interesting story and was recently repaired after an arsonist set fire to it in 2008. The day we visited it there were some people in military costumes who performed a change of the guard.
18,4.0,Namdaemun Gate is an icon in Seoul. While really just providing a photo opportunity for westerners it is its significance in Seoul's original wall structure that makes it so important.
19,4.0,"The gate is similar to the Dongdaemun gate, with the exception that you can walk through it. Visiting one gate should be enough. Although it's just a gate, how many gates are still there from the old times? Feel and experience this antique 'artwork from Seoul dynasty'."
20,4.0,"Seoul is (well, was) a walled city, so has numerous gates, generally identified by direction.  The one under review is the South Gate, which is pretty spectacular and is near the Namdaemun Markets, which are accessible by Metro.I've posted a photo of Sungnyemun, but also of the East Gate, so you get the idea.I had hoped to tick them all off, but didn't.  Maybe you will?"
21,3.0,"I wouldn’t consider this a main attraction and worth hunting for while in Seoul. However, if you are in the Myeongong or the Namedaemun area, it’s worth looking out for and snapping some photos. The architecture is beautiful and worth a quick stop."
22,5.0,"Nice monument. Then u can walk to the walls and then, if u feel fit, walk all the way to the bottom of the North Tower."
23,4.0,"Very much enjoyed visiting with my husband. I was just enthralled to experience a piece of history dating back to 1396, Joseon Dynasty"
24,4.0,"S. Korea's Treasure No. 1; the Namdaemun Gate or ""Great South Gate""  (f/k/a Sungnyemun Gate), is a ""Must See"" on list of places to see in Seoul; and provides a good Photo Op."
25,3.0,"Just a gate located in the centre, you actually don’t have to look for it shopping and moving around in Namdeamun you will see it, if you want to take a picture evening hours are perfect!"
26,4.0,When you first see it you are struck by how it seems so out of place! Now imagine many years ago the walls that encircled the city of Seoul and this w as one of the principal gates to enter/depart the city.It was the victim of an arson attack a few years ago but has been entirely restored. The paintings are beautiful.There's a stamp challenge you can do if you visit all four former city gates (for the cardinal directions). Pick up a sheet at the visitor center and get your first stamp right outside (ask if you can't find it). Great idea!You'll undoubtedly be near the gate if you venture out to shop at Namdaemun Market. Come over here to escape the crowds and regroup.
27,4.0,"Sungnyemun - recently rebuilt after being burnt down by a lunatic - is truly stunning. I absolutely love how they restored it by mixing in neat modern white-ish materials on the edge with the antique actual door at the middle. What's fascinating about this neighborhood (besides the door) is that it is so diverse. You're a couple of minutes away from Seoul Station, the ultramodern City Hall, the old Deoksogung palace, the traditional Namdaemun market, decrepited smaller houses on the South Side, and sky-reaching glass buildings on the North End. This place is really central to Seoul and Korea, and the fact that cars swirl around the door only reinforces the sentiment that Sungnyemun is really the heart of the city of Seoul."
28,4.0,"Namdaemun Market is a place that tourists must go. They sell various types of stuffs. From daily products, local products, clothes (adults and children). Remember to bargain for discount before buying as some of the products are more expensive. You can get cheap facial products from ""The Face Shop"" at Namdaemun Market as well. Please note that the retail opening hour is mostly from 9am till 5pm and from 10pm till wee in the morning for whole sale.Do remember to try their local delights at the tented restaurants on wheels (Pojangchama). They open from evening till late at night."
29,4.0,"If you go to Namdaemun it's a pity not to visit this gate and snap a few pictures. Well re-constructed, looks beautiful."
30,4.0,"This was once the main South Entrance to the Seoul City Walls. Now at the North side of the interesting Namdaemun Market, it has recently been extensively restored. Despite being rather surrounded by traffic and modern development, it is certainly worth a look."
31,4.0,We had a long lay over at Incheon Airport and we took the Express train to Seoul station so we could visit Sungnyemun Gate and Namdaemun Market. It was very easy and much more fun than sitting in the airport for seven hours.
32,3.0,"This is the symbol of the nation and a point of pride for the Korean people.  It looks very nice and it has been well re-constructed after the arson attack a few years ago.  While it is a nice gate, there is little there to take up your time as a tourist.  After a few good photos of the gate, you can move on without having to explore it deeper."
33,3.0,"Like the Dongdaemun Gate, the Namdaemun Gate is just a historical structure in the middle of an intersection, with little else to see or do. Seeing either one would suffice, since they are pretty similar. I wasn't too enamoured by the quiet, dark and even boring Namdaemun Night Market nearby as well, so I would recommend that you just head to Dongdaemun for a view (and mandatory picture) of the gate, and a far better shopping and dining experience."
34,3.0,"It's a large gate surrounded by modern skyscrapers. It's a nice mix of styles: Asian and western architecture. It's a reconstruction and it works like a roundabout, there is lots of traffic around it. That's pretty much it."
