There was no kimchi making class on the day of our visit.We were given a ticket and thats it no explanatory on what to expect etc..If you guys have free time and money to waste then please visit. If not dont bother. Better visit the Kimchi Academy in Myeong Dong.
1,4.0,"This quaint museum in Insadong is dedicated to kimchi. Adult admission is $8USD. It isn't terribly big, so you can pretty much get through it in about an hour. My husband and I went on a Friday afternoon, and there was literally no one else there. There are a couple of kimchi documentaries that play in two different rooms, two or three interactive activities, kimchi artifacts, and hanbok garments you can try on for free. I really enjoyed the taste tasting room where you can sample three different types of kimchi, which you can only enter by scanning your admission ticket. There was also a kimchi making room, but you have to set that up with the front desk. Overall, it's a nice play to wander if you wanna wind down after walking through Insadong."
2,3.0,"The museum located in one of the alleys in Insadong.  It is a small museum that show you various kinds of kimchi and how they are made.  There are videos, photos, stamps, and other fun activities.  On the top floor, you even get to taste a few different type of kimchi.Admission is required (I think it is 10000W).  You can spend a couple of hours there and kids will like it.If you visit Insadong and your schedule is not tight, it's good to have a visit.  Otherwise you don't have to come all the way to see it."
3,3.0,"We went to the Insadong tourist information center on the Insadong cultural street to ask for directions and it was just down the road!  The local tourist map of Insadong makes it easy to find.  And we were given a 40% off discount voucher for the museum.  On the day / time we went, we were the only visitors.  Two Korean families went up in the lift with us but for whatever reason decided not to continue.  Your ticket allows you to get into the display areas on the 4th - 6th floors of the building by scanning in your ticket to get the door open. The kimchi tasting is self-service which you just get it from a refrigerator and there were only 3 kinds to try.  And they are the milder ones.  Various types of kimchis are displayed in bottles in the refrigerators.  I had expected to see more types as I read somewhere there are 180+ types of kimchis.  And if you want to wear Korean costume, they are there for you to wear during your visit so your selfies look more authentic!"
4,5.0,"The entry for two only cost us KRW5000 as they had a two-for-one offer and we were also given two complimentary bottles of water. We also borrowed two English audio guides - make sure you have an ID on you.The museum is very interactive and educational - staff go out of their way to show you how the displays work to maximise your experience. You can also try on a hanbok and take pictures in it for free. (An experience that often costs KRW 15,000 on Insandong)Make sure you watch some of the short films on kimchi making - they are very interesting.You can also design a postcard on the top floor where they have a range of cute kimchi-themed (obviously!) stamps.Next to the card-making room is a 'kimchi experience' workshop where, I think, you can sing up for a kimchi-making class."
5,3.0,"Honestly, we happened upon the Kimchi Museum accidentally and we were freezing so decided to check it out to get out of the cold. It was very interesting to learn more about what many would consider to be the national dish of Korea, and we enjoyed the interactive displays and information. Signage at the museum said it's one of the world's top food museums, but like others have said, there isn't a ton to do and it won't take you long to go through it. An annoyance for me was the fact that there wasn't a coat check and they wouldn't let us leave our coats up front so we had to lug them around with us throughout the visit, which detracted from the experience."
6,2.0,"The only reason we visited this gallery is because the day we chose to visit Insa Dong, it was snowing heavily and some of the souvenir and handicraft stores were closed due to the heavy snow flurries. We wanted to wait it out so there were a few museums and galleries there so we visited them. I am not a gallery fan but the art here was very attractive and the people in the gallery weren’t trying to push their art. If you are into art galleries you might want to check this place out since it impressed me and I’m not an art lover."
7,3.0,"Not a whole lot of information. The displays were interactive though, which was nice. They had samples of kimchi out as well. If youre dying to learn about kimchi then check this out otherwise it can be passed"
8,5.0,"Come find this excellent museum in the Maru builidng in Insa-dong.5,000 Korean won entrance fee includes audio guide (high recommend you get this as it'll make your experience better if you're a non-Korean speaker).Videos to watch and even samples of two types of kimchi. Love it!"
9,3.0,"Actually this was surprisingly memorable even for it's novelty value.  Not being Korean myself, kimchi has limited value to me aside from liking the taste.  But for Koreans it's a matter of national identity.  I wouldn't travel too far to see this but if you're in the area and need something with an A/C. Ha ha.  You will learn some stuff. Always a good thing."
