1,4.0,"It was a fine Monday afternoon when we went there.  I've already visited a similar tower in Taiwan last year, and I can say that this is better.  The elevator speed was impressive. Up in the tower,  I felt uneasy but made the most out of my visit by taking pictures. I liked the crystal floor where you can see the ground. The crew members were accommodating and the cafe is well-managed.  On several areas of the viewing decks,  you can have enough space to take pics. People visiting that time seem too happy with their experience. I would definitely recommend this to friends."
2,5.0,I really loved this place. The views were amazing and I even walked on the glass floor. Really nice bars and restaurants with good food and great beer.
3,1.0,"I visited Seoul Sky on 18 Apr 2019 and didn't notice that there was too much smoke in the sky or not, but staff ignored to inform any proper info to us. They just sell ticket and cannot speak English. In the entrance area, Service staff also delivered bad service to guests, not provide any info and forced us to walk into the gate urgently. Finally, we have failed to see anything on the top. There were too much smoke. I just wondered that why they want to sell the tickets without considering the guests would be satisfied on view on not. If customers have no chance to see clearly on that day, they shouldn't sell any tickets. So weird!!!!!"

5,5.0,"A trip to Seoul Sky Observatory should be on the bucket list of things to do for every visitor to the capital of South Korea. It is the perfect place to get an overview of the sprawling metropolis in cool, airconditioned comfort. Clear skies will give the best views so if you have a flexible schedule, check out the visibility chart at the entrance prior to buying your tickets. Visit on weekdays to skip the queues and thick crowds, and pay with Mastercard for 10% off the standard ticket price of ₩27,000. The experience is worth every won of the ticket price. Seoul Sky offers an immersive, interactive experience from the moment you step into the ticketed area, to the one minute elevator ride and six floors of viewing areas (117/F to 122/F). There are touch screen panels at various points of the viewing decks with information on the city's landmarks. Skip the cramped souvenir kiosk on 120/F and browse at leisure at the spacious souvenir shop on the ground floor after the downward elevator ride. The latter carries the full range of merchandise including premium items and promotional items that are not offered at the cramped kiosk on 120/F. Show the Seoul Sky ticket for discounted entry (only valid on the same day/date) to the Aquarium at B1 of Lotte World Tower."
6,5.0,"You can just buy your ticket there, you can stay there for as long as you want. We stayed there for awhile because we wanted to see how it looked like at night as well. It was really cool. The glass floors were great and kind of scary but it makes for a really good picture. Go there at like 5 or 4 pm and stay until sunset. Its really so nice to see Seoul from up high."
7,5.0,great place to have a 360 view of Seoul. the ticket provides access to several floors of the observation deck. if you pay with a MasterCard you get 10% discount on the price of the ticket. I don't know how busy this place gets at certain times but we just turned up and bought tickets
8,4.0,"I was sooo moved when I saw the whole Seoul on Seoul Sky. My friends and I went to Seoul Sky for my 3rd day of Seoul. We spent the whole day at Lotte world adventure the day before so we were very tired at that time. HOWEVER we could totally forget our tiredness immediately while going up. It was reallyyyy fast!! I was a bit scared but I could be patient of it because it took just a minute. And then I could see Seoul, literally Seoul Sky. I appreciated to my friend. Thanks to my friend, I got 10% discount on Admission fee via Visit Korea Mastercard."

10,5.0,korea building construction technology is amazing. they built almost every highest buildings including dubai burzu khalipa and tyoko tree tower. now opened 123th floor. 550m world highest 4 building in seoul. nice view and safe and world record guiness #1 high speed elevator are really nice place to visit.
11,4.0,"This is highest tower in town with great view of the city. From 120th floor you can have a panoramic city, Han viver and all buidings, houses. It is very nice at night. Just only thing is that the queue is quite long so we had to wait quite long. The design and setting up indide are not impressive, not unique and special.The view is just great !"
12,5.0,"Seoul Sky!! The newest skyscraper in Seoul that offers more than just 360deg view of the city. It has many decks you can have for yourself without nudging elbows with other tourists. The interiors are quite new you can smell them as you enter that awesome LED entrance and that LED hallway leading up to that uber fast elevator which is just as awesome as well. It has lesser crowds compared to N-Seoul and quite expectedly, more expensive but well worth your buck! The biggest come-on is the vertigo inducing glass transparent floor. Test that phobia of yours if you can!!"
13,4.0,"On my last day in Seoul, my brother's brother-in-law (referenced hereafter as Brotha) took me here to check out Lotte World Tower for the view.  We got there a little early (before 9 AM) so we spent some time walking around the massive Lotte empire.Talk about cool!  From the lobby to the entrance and the walk to the elevator, you are inundated with sights and sounds building up the buzz of what you are about to see!  The elevator ride alone to the top was very entertaining.  When the doors opened atop though, Mother Nature was showing us that she was not interested in cooperating as visibility was near zero.We killed some time at the coffee bar and kept our fingers crossed.  30 minutes later, some of the fog had lifted though not anywhere what was needed to allow us to see the many views that would've otherwise been realized on a clear day.Like many of the other tall towers out there (Eiffel Tower, Tokyo Tower, CN Tower, Space Needle), there is a glass floor that you can stand on and take pictures of the drop below.  This one gets extra points though as b/c of its relative newness, the glass is essentially scratch free and clear as the waters of the Caribbean.Though we did not get to see miles upon miles out, it was still a neat experience.  Be sure to check out the weather forecast before you decide whether or not you want to visit.  Pricing is reasonable (~$30) to zip to the top per person.Great drinks atop as well as nice selection of souvenirs."
