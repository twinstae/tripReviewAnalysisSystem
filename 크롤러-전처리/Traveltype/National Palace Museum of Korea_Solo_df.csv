There are free digital locker to store my backpack. This museum displays royal relics from the Joseon Dynasty. There are many exhibition halls, with each hall displaying exhibits of Kings of the Joseon Dynasty,  Joseon Palaces, Royal Court Life,  Korean Empire, Astronomy & Science Hall Ⅰ, Royal Court Paintings, Jongmyo, the Royal Ancestral Shrine, Royal Court Music, Royal Procession, Astronomy & Science Hall Ⅱ. After visiting the museum, I have a better understanding of the King’s life during that era. Admission is free with toilet facilities and seats for resting."
1,5.0,"The museum is medium sized compared to most museums I've visited, but that means it is extensive enough to peak your interest but manageable enough to complete in one morning/afternoon session. The exhibits range all the way back to the 1300s until 1910 when the Korean royalty was overthrown by the Japanese."
2,1.0,"I was just going to write a good review on this museum but then I met the people on the information desk so I decided to give it a poor one. It’s a small museum but I think it’s quite informative. I found it quite enjoyable, especially since they have a Liechtenstein exhibition when I visited the museum. So after walking around for quite a bit, I found out that they have these stamps with palaces (special) logos on it that you can stamped in a stamp book provided by the museum. On the desk where these stamps are provided, there’s a piece of paper mentioning that we should ask the information desk for the stamp book (if we want to get one). So I walked happily to the information desk with the sign “English” in front of it, with a big smile on my face I said hello since the lady (she looked maybe like late 30ish-40ish) there seemed to ignoring me. I said hello and then asked her politely can I get the stamp book here, and she rudely just staring at me and grunted “hmph” and without saying anything just waving and pointing her fingers at a small table near the information desk. I don’t know why she acted that way, is it because I’m Asian? I was just so shocked to find such a behavior from a “professional”. I don’t get it. The gentleman who was on the front door greeting us and smiled at us when we first walked in, so I thought at first “oh wow they’re really friendly”. FYI, it’s not that rare to find locals here even though they’re working in a service area to be rude to people with a darker skin tone. When I first got here a few days ago, in the airport I was asking to some uncle about the tax form desk, and he also just grunted at me and waving /pointing his fingers around with some broken English “later later you can find it”and he didn’t look at me at all while saying this. It’s like I was some nuisance that he couldn’t wait to get rid off. Oh yeah, actually the lady also did the same way, she also didn’t look at me while she’s pointing the table to me. The funny thing was, when I walked passed the information desk later on, there’s a couple from Europe asking the same thing to her and she even got up from her chair, gladly went with them to show them where to find the stamp book, with a big smile on her face, being chatty and all. So what’s the deal? Smh."
3,4.0,"This place is spacious and has many exhibits, great for anyone interested in the history of the country. As it is located at a side entrance of Gyeongbokgung, ie Gyeongbokgung Metro Station Exit 5, it is really convenient to visit."
4,5.0,"I highly recommend a short visit to this wonderful museum on Korean history on the Gyeongbokgung Palace grounds.  Most people opt not to visit the museum which is a shame.  There is no admission fee.  The museum can be easily covered in an hour or two.  If anything, the museum is a great place for a short rest and (clean) bathroom break after touring the palace grounds.  There is ample seating and the museum is very calm and peaceful.  It’s actually worth visiting on its own independently from the Palace IMO."
5,4.0,"This museum is free and right next to the main palace. It is worth seeing because the palace is mostly empty. You can learn a lot about royal customs here including clothing, birth, marriage, etc... There are many displays including 2 rare cars that the Korean king and queen owned. This is not the best museum in Seoul but it is still very good and a must visit for anyone interested in learning about the Korean royal history. The gift shop has some good quality souvenirs in various price ranges. I rarely buy things at attractions but this one actually had some good ones that I bought for a reasonable price."
6,5.0,3 stories museum with plenty of artifacts showcasing the history and culture of South Korea from infancy. You don't need a guide to explore this museum as they are well presented and laid for any one to enjoy and be informed/educated of the country's history. It is within the grounds of Gyeongbokgung Palace and is totally entrance free.
7,4.0,It’s free admission to this museum which is next to the Gyeongbokgung Palace.  This museum is next to exit 5 of the Gyeongbokgung Station for the L3 subway line.  It is best to combine the visit to this museum with a visit to the Gyeongbokgung Palace and the National Folk Museum of Korea.The museum is well organized with displays in both Korean and English and provides an interesting view of royal life.  There are also displays of scientific achievements of the Joseon Dynasty including a self-striking water clock.
8,5.0,"Fine museum focused on every aspect of life for Korean royalties, lots of interesting objects all displayed and explained clearly in multiple languages.  There’s a lot to see, and many did not make it to the lower floors where there is an amazing self-striking water clock. The information provided actually gives me a better understanding of the Gyeongbokgung palace than a cursory walk through the expansive palatial grounds.  This place is easy to miss given the large number of attractions in the area, but  worth a couple of hours for someone interested in learning more about imperial life in Korea."
9,4.0,"Visited this museum today. It is located in the compound of the Gyeongbokgung Palace. It is rest assured much more interesting than the Palace which is essentially a haunt of self seeking selfie takers.The museum is fascinating and looks at the rulers of the Chosun dynasty.  From monarchies to palaces, from protocol, customs and ceremonies to every day life. Good mementos of the Emperors - their seals, portraits and artefacts. Royal cars, palanquins, flags, kitchen wear - you name it, it's here. This is a great museum to fascinate the inquisitive and the historian. Allow at least 2 to 3 hours. This should be a must on your list."
10,4.0,"The National Palace Museum of Korea is within the grounds of the Gyeongbokgung Palace. It was opened in 1992. Many of the exhibits are mainly from the three palaces and date back to the Joseon Dynasty from late 14th century. The palaces are Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung and Changgyeonggung.

11,5.0,"Although it's inside the palace grounds, this museum is completely free and you don't need to visit the palace to see the museum. Considering all the Seoul palaces are bereft of antiquities and treasures, the museum is the only place you can discover what treats there might have been inside once upon a time. As of October 2017, the lower floors were all closed and the upper floor was partially undergoing renovations, but the ground floor was open."
12,4.0,"What caught my eyes were royal cars displayed in the museum. Otherwise, other museums offer more. It is free, which is a bonus."
13,4.0,"The museum is located on the ground of Gyeongbokgung Palace. Very extensive exhibits of over 20,000 royal relics from the Joseon Dynasty. Very detailed information about about the royalty. It covers the Royal symbols and records, ancestral rites, palace architecture, Joseon sciences and the Royal life. A visit to the museum is a must if you plan on visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace. Free admission and it's conveniently located next to a metro stop. Take Orange Line 3 to Gyeongbokgung stop."
14,4.0,"Admission is free so even if you don't like it, no harm no foul. The museum has some nice objects but nothing really spectacular, but you also get an insight into palace life and the sad short lived life of the Korean Empire. General descriptions are in English , items descriptions only give the name in English."
15,5.0,This museum contains a vast array of memorable artifacts.The layout is very simple and clear. The high spot for me were the two vinatage burgandy cars. Looked stunning.
16,5.0,"This museum is better and more interesting than the National Museum of Korea. It has lots of detailed information about the life in Korean cities and court before the modern times. The layout is well thought out and easy to follow. Lots of interesting information at the side of exhibits and in audioguide. Also many exhibits have excellent videos to accompany them, like reconstructions of court rituals, how things were built, etc. There is one particulary interesting video about ancester worship in the court and another one how the royal tombs were built. One very interesting object amongst others is a first hour clock in Korea, built in 15th century, that struck the hours. If you are into history this museum is a place to visit. If you have little time drop the National Museum and visit this one instead. In the same territory you also get one of the main palaces (They are side by side) and at the back of the palace make sure you also visit Folk Museum. Palace Museum is more about the life of royalty in the past and Folk Museum is equally good, focusing on simple folks life in the past. The entry fee to both palace and Folk Museum is 3000 won (about 3 USD), palace museum is free."
17,3.0,So many of the museums are much the same for the foreigner and this one was no different. There is some English but for many of the exhibits all you get was the name of the item in English which you could in most cases guess anyway. I found that after a bit that I just walked round with just a casual glance at things. It also wasn't well sign posted on where to go next. I didn't find anything new in this museum that I hadn't seen in others. Or when there was something different there was no English explanation of it
18,4.0,"The National Palace Museum of Korea is located next to the Gyeongbokgung Palace. It is very easy to access via the subway Gyeongbokgung station. Lots of insight into the life of the kings and queens over 3 floors. From cars, paintings, musical instruments,royal seals etc it has artifacts from the palaces over the kingdoms. It is free but closed on Mondays. Gyeongbokgung palace is closed on Tuesdays to do take note. The restaurant serves decent but not fantastic food at reasonable prices."
19,5.0,"Easy access, right off the subway.  Clean and well lit, fairly clear explanations in English, very friendly staff.  Plenty to do for little kids.  This is good for older, younger, dates, anybody.  Free entry.  Pricey gift shop. Awe inspiring air conditioning. Start on B1 and work your way up."
