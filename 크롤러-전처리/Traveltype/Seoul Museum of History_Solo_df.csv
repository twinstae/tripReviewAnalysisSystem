0,4.0,"I love going to museums and the admission for this one is free.  They have it organized clearly and you can learn about Korean history. They also have a small cafe that sells drinks, coffee, tea and light snacks.  There is also a nice gift shop there. However, when I went to go inside, I found it was closed. The person who runs it took a VERY long lunch break. This was very irritating to me. Twice, I had to go and ask the front desk lady where the person was because I wanted to buy some gifts.  The lady was nice and called the person and five minutes later the person came and opened up the store. Except for this, my overall experience here was great."
1,4.0,I found this museum more interesting than the Korean War Museum or the National Museum. I particularly liked the section on the reconstruction of the city after 1953 and its development over the following frenetic decades.
2,5.0,"The three floors museum represent The Joseon dynasty, it is very interesting for the new visitor to Korea. The museum is free and can be combined with a visit to the Palace."
3,5.0,If you have time do visit this very interesting museum that showcases the six centuries of Seoul’s storied past. From its early founding as a strategic capital for the unified Korean kingdom because of the fengshui and laid out in Confucian principles it grew to become a walled city with a central avenue of commercial sites and an expanding palace with administrative buildings. If you  are familiar with period Korean dramas you will recognise the sets and interiors. From a medieval city it had to modernise with the arrival of westerners and rapid change in the late 19th century. The Japanese colonial government further changed the urban landscape from its crowded houses to more planned streets with amenities. However the medieval soul was gradually torn away with the demolition of historical sites such as the Temple of Heaven. Note the similarities with Beijing in terms of fengshui and Imperial urban planning. The much disliked colonial townhall was also built to obstruct the Korean palace. You will start to see the birth of Korean nationalism as you wander into this exhibition area. All this was devastated during the Korean War that left Seoul pretty much with only standing stone chimneys. The rapid urbanisation during the Asian Tiger economy era resulted in a functional city with little thought around urban design and well planned spaces for an exploding population that grew to ten million eventually. You will end the visit with a birds eye model of the entire city to appreciate the geography and some of the major landmarks and notable districts in Seoul.
4,5.0,"This is a fun museum and I have been here several times. For a first-time visitor, plan on at least 2-3 hours to visit. My favorite part was recent history from the 1920's to the 1990's. There is even a model of a 1980's apartment to show you how an average family lived then. The display about life for Koreans during WWII is excellent as well and explains how hard things were during the Japanese occupation. It is one of the first places you should visit in Seoul."
5,5.0,When traveling to Seoul this is a perfect way to get a foundational overview of the cities history. You only need 90 minutes.  It's free.
6,5.0,"I wish I'd spent more time here, there was even a school group practicing for an orchestral presentation. And it was FREE! You need to take your time to take it all in. I took an Uber from the Seoul of Museum of Art to be efficient. I have a much greater appreciation for Seoul and S. Korea as a people/nation of overcomers and survivors."
7,5.0,This museum is located in a walking range from the subway.  The arrangement of the permanent exhibition is well-organized.  This allowed me to know better about Seoul in a limited time.  Friendly for non Korean speakers.
8,5.0,"I'm not a city museum type of person but I do have a bit of time before heading out to the airport therefore came for a visit, the best part of it is that this museum is free admission at all times and it's just a short walk from the guanghwamun which is very convenient. It's divided in a few eras, from the Empire dynasty to the Japanese colonized period, to the most recent booming of the city, everything is detailed. Great to spend an hour or 2!"
9,5.0,"Another well designed Seoul museum located in the contemporary building. Well thought-out and well put together exhibition, as in many other museums in Seoul that I visited. The main message is a story of the transformation of Seoul from a small fishermen village to the one of the major world capitals. Don't miss a hall where you walk on the elevated walkway with Seoul map on the floor underneath. You can push a button for a specific city area and this area will be illuminated on the map. It helps to understand the city layout. There is a good coffee shop on the ground floor and not bad looking museum shop. You would need around 2 hours for a visit. Recommended."
10,4.0,Nice museum very close to Gwanghamun St. Museum shop is good for souvenirs. Best part of it is the City at the 3F. I found it amazing. Walking over a small scale of the whole city
11,4.0,"The Admission: FREE admissionThe Museum: Very informative and educational. This museum give me a overview of the life and culture in the early days of Seoul. There is English, Japanese and Chinese portable audio guide rental. The Location: Subway Line 5, Gwanghwamun Station, Exit 6, 7 or 8"
12,4.0,"Really nice place, admission is free, audio guide is free (you gotta bring an id for it), even water is free. It has 4 permanent exhibitions in which you get to see the evolution of corea, so if you like to read about history this is just the right place for you, I don't specially liked the audio guide since most of the times just adviced me to read the information on the walls -.-! Anyways the city model of Seoul at the end is just amazing!"
13,4.0,"First of all, this museum has FREE ENTRY.  So even if you don't like it, all it cost you was your time.This museum is easy to navigate and has a good flow.  There are arrows to make sure you are going in chronological order.  Lots of artifacts too.  Most have an English title, but not necessarily English description.  IF YOU GO:  Bring your passport!  You can get an audio guide for free.  They are available in English, Chinese and Japanese."
14,5.0,There is a permanent exhibit about Seoul here. There are lots to learn about and lots of fun things to do so you can bring children here. Its free for everyone to get in. Kyunghee palace is right beside the museum.
15,5.0,"Really interesting story of Seoul history with great photos. Good timeline of events, learned a lot about this fascinating city. Nice shop and fantastic kitch 70s building."
16,5.0,"I chose to review this museum because of the emphasis placed on details and the creative methods used to evoke sensations that make you feel like you are travelling in time. The museum covers Korean history from the middle of the 19th century until the end of the 20th century. There are five exhibits that progressively take you from one era to the next, and over the course of two weeks and four visits, I carefully went through every exhibit and read every placard. The story conveyed is one of adaptation. It isn't the typical representation of national greatness that history museums tend to portray. In fact, it is quite honest, and almost unbiased. The Koreans have had to adapt to great powers and influences that have imposed their imperial policies and culture on them. The exhibits shows how they adapted to European colonial and missionary pressure, Japanese imperialism and WWII, communism and America's proxy war with Russia and China, and the modernization accelerated by globalization. This is one of the most detailed and honest museums I have experienced. It is more than just a casual walk through. I brought with me a good understanding of how Koreans might identify themselves, where they find pride and where they find humility. I highly recommend this museum."
17,4.0,"This very informative museum covers primarily the history and culture of South Korea's capital city Seoul. It covers the entire period, from pre-historic times to the present,  with particular emphasis on the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910). Most of the artifacts on display have been very generously  donated by the people of Seoul themselves.Among the items on display are porcelainware, traditional costumes and head-gear, paintings and portraits, calligraphy, historical photographs, examples of Western influences, like a tophat and its case, items of household goods like electrical appliances, and the like.Outdoor displays include a part of the Gwanghwamun Gate, an early-vintage tramcar that had actually operated on the streets of Seoul, and various stone carvings. Exhibits of life during the Joseon period, the Golden Age of Korea, are much emphasised. The museum is located on the grounds of the Gyeonghuigung Palace. Apart from its permanent exhibits, it also has temporary events in a special exhibition hall,  adjacent to the permanent one.There is also an additional hall featuring mainly the donated exhibits.There is a separate Education Room for children, an auditorium for cultural performances, like classical dances and music, as well as the Pansori - Korean vocal music sung solo, and with narrative themes.The Museum Shop has wide-ranging memorablia of Seoul, alongside a cafe and a very useful, information centre.A must-visit museum for a better understanding of Korean culture and way of life.Hormuz Mama"
18,4.0,"I visited this museum over two separate days--it was larger than I expected and I ran out of time. Expect to spend several hours here. The bathrooms are clean, and there is a cafe and souvenir shop on the first floor. The permanent exhibit covers all of Seoul's history. The lighting was a little too dark but the displays were well done.There were also special exhibits, also free, one showcasing a photographer's work (Françoise Huguier), and another talking about art in the lives of people in Seoul in the Joseon dynasty. I also loved the exhibit showing historical photos from Seoul, many in the 1950s.My favorite part was the permanent section on Korea after the Korean War. It helped me get a sense of how quickly Korea has developed. While celebrating the achievements made in such a short time, it doesn't sugar-coat the problems or errors made. I also enjoyed the large diorama of modern day Seoul, which was so accurate I could find my apartment building. I would recommend this for anyone interested in Seoul history. I think kids would enjoy this. There is a palace next door, and it is close to several other museums (the Agricultural Museum, a police museum, a rice museum, just to name a few). It isn't very far from 경복궁/Gyeongbokgung Palace."
19,4.0,"This was a nice way to spend a cool Sunday afternoon.  This museum presents a geographical history of the city of Seoul since the start of the Joseon Dynasty.  The permanent exhibit includes artifacts, maps, and dioramas of the development of the city.  It gives a good frame of reference to the city.  The final room is a current diorama of the city.  Admission is currently free and there is a nice museum store.  Be prepared for lots of school kids and families but in general they are well behaved.  They are learning about their city.  The museum is close to Gwanghwamun and the number 5 subway line."
20,3.0,"I enjoyed the speical exhibition in Feb, 2016.  It was about the royal court.  The screens were fantastic and the effects were good.  However, it was somewhat dark in the main building itself, the entral hall was empty, and the souverior shop was closed for lunch, I suppose, and I felt it uninviting. The level of noise from young students was somewhat annoying.  It is unfortunate as it accupies such a great centre location of Seoul with a great history and activities. I felt that it was a waste of valuable resources."
21,3.0,"When I was there, there was a Lego cross over Anderson exhibition at the Seoul Museum of History.  It also holds exhibits about Seoul history and daily lives of locals."
22,4.0,"There are an awful lot of good historical museums in Korea, but each seems to be focused on one aspect and doesn’t give the full picture of the country. The National Museum of Korea is centered on ancient history which might not resonate to foreign visitors. The War Memorial of Korea is a superb museum as well, but it distorts the fact that since the Unified Shilla dynasty (which started around 650), Korea has actually been a fairly peaceful country. The National Museum of Korean Contemporary History pretty much only deals with the 20th century, and can be – if ever so slightly – overly nationalistic. The National Folk Museum of Korea is more of a collection of artifacts from the old days rather than a true testament to Korean history. The Seoul Museum of History, on the other hand, despite being small (it doesn’t take more than 2 hours to visit), does a great job at showing the history of Korea since the 14th century, through the eyes of the city’s evolution. It perfectly depicts the evolution of Seoul and Korea has well, without glossing over the harder times of the city’s history. The museum also has an interactive model of the city that is something like 15*20 meters and allows you to see individual buildings, while highlighting specific areas thanks to a nice user-interface. This place alone makes the museum worth the trip, and is very kids-friendly. The only drawbacks about this museum is that it doesn’t have the scale of some of the city’s larger museums, and the building itself is not the most aesthetically pleasing, especially considering that the museum only opened in 2002."
23,5.0,"Breathtaking huge interactive model of the city; amazing collection of artifacts and photos, well displayed and explained in English; and most striking exhibit of the evolution of the 20th-century megalopolis that leaves no doubt whatsoever about how and why Koreans love the Japanese so much!"
24,5.0,The Seoul Museum of History is a wonderful museum which puts all of the history you learn about at other places in Seoul into perspective. The section about life in Seoul under the Joseon dynasty features impressive models and information about how the government worked and where certain social groups and business and leisure activities happened. The sections about life under Japanese occupation and the development of the city since the end of the Korean War were very interesting and show just how remarkable a place this city is. The best part of the museum is saved for last - a massive scale model of Seoul!
25,5.0,"I found this museum far more interesting than the National Museum. There is a large collection of artefacts here spreading over hundreds of years. The lady in the streetcar out the front was really friendly, chatting to me in English and Korean. The temporary exhibit was really interesting, and displayed in a very artistic way. I particularly enjoyed watching the development of the city over the last 200 years. They had a really nice courtyard, which on a sunny day would have been beautiful to enjoy while eating something from the cafe. Oh yeah, and it was free!"
26,5.0,"On the ground floor is a beautifully laid out display of 50 top artefacts which tell the story of the city from early times up until yesterday.  The layout of the other floors is a bit confusing, but worth wandering around as you can really get a feel for the growth of this amazing city, told through photos, videos, models and artefacts."
27,5.0,"I loved this place, together with everything else, it has a couple of very nice things, one of them was you could have you picture taken in different Korean outfits, this was a digital gadget that was really funny and then there was the model that shows all of Seoul build inside the museum, also window glas in different colors. Try to see this place."
28,5.0,"Out to give you a short , concise information about the colorful history of Seoul, Throw in a visit to Gyeonghiguing Palace, at the back,  and your day will be complete."
29,4.0,A good way to spend 1-2 hours getting some background on Korean History with an emphasis on Seoul. Lots of hands-on experiences for kids. Easy to find. Free admission. A Nice gift shop.
