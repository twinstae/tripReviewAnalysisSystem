0,4.0,We went to Seoul World Cup Stadium using subway from Osan. It takes around 1:40 hour but I it was nice to see that stadium built for 2002 World Cup that Brazil won.
1,3.0,"As i heard from the tourist guide, this Stadium are meant so much to the Koreans. This where the place they have their proud of becoming the host for World Cup and where they beat their rival off. During my visit this stadium are empty. Not much visitors only a few guard, maybe because it still in the morning. Walk around the museums, taking picture with the keepers and go to the souvenir shop. Most of the souvenir you can get from anywhere, hehe."

3,4.0,"How many world cup stadiums have you been before? I had to take my chance to visit this stadium. It's impressive that even in a Saturday without any event on stadium, stairs were clean of ice! World Cup 2012 Museum was opened, even that empty, but all complex were with a lot of people jogging, playing basketball.Also impressive that stadium have several rooms for marriage ceremonies. It's not an old complex without usage!"
