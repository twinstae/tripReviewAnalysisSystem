0,4.0,I stayed at the lotte hotel right next to this main store. I felt the prices are a bit higher than other places. It is very convenient if you donâ€™t like leaving the hotel and things. Overall it is very nice mall.
1,5.0,Really nice department store. Interesting product mix. Great visual merchandising and impressive standards.
2,4.0,This in my opinion one of the best department stores Asia has to offer! When you come to shop be sure to bring your passport because you can get a percentage back for duty free.
3,1.0,Crowded and overpriced is your first hit.Counterfeit and unhelpful staff are your next.I wouldn't recommend going.
4,5.0,"I've been to Lotte dep store last year and this November when visiting Seoul. The dep store has everything, if you're looking for one place to do your shopping- this is the place. When visiting in the end of November the department store had beautiful christmas decorations- it's worth seeing. Positives#great selection of brands and mercendies, helpfull and serviceminded staff.#lottemart on basement level where youbcan buy all kinds of korean tea, snacks, cakes to bring home#dutyfree on floor 9-11 with great selection, if you're from Skandinavia or countries with heavy import taxes, you can save on your purshases#excellent foodhall with very reasonable prices and amazing selection of high quality food, #subway connetion to the nr.2 lineNegatives# if you're impationt in crowds, you might want to avoid afternoon and weekends. #this is not the place to go for cheap shopping #may not be abel to save that much on US brands in the dutyfree if you're living in the US"
