If you have children with you it's perfect to give them some kids time and you a chance to sit and relax. Walking away from the museum steps head to your left and down the ramp. You will see a small lake with fish. Walk further to your left and there is a garden with various pagodas. You can read their history as you walk through the tree lined gardens. There is a flowing stream with small falls that sound amazing. A nice change from the busy streets. You will make your way to a children's playground. It is clean and nicely kept. There are benches under trees do you can sit and relax. There are bathrooms and water fountains. If you are a runner, there are paths and even a work out area with traditional Korean workout equipment. Some are fairly odd, but you will see the older Koreans using it. Overall, it is worth checking out."
1,4.0,Wandered through the gardens and footpaths of the Yongsan Family Park with my children one humid August Sunday and enjoyed the visit. Lots of families out with picnics. Pretty little waterfall and lots of little ponds. We connected to the National Museum of Korean History and walked through the temple gardens then stopped for a drink near the top plaza and enjoyed the free outdoor concert.  A lovely escape from the city streets!
