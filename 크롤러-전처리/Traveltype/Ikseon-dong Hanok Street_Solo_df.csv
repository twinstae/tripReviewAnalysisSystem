0,4.0,Little alleys with quaint cafes and themed restaurants. The whole vibe of the place was pleasant. Surprises await you at every turn. So fortunate that my hotel - Makers Hotel was just opposite so i could visit it easily both in the day and night.

Do not missed this place if you come to Insadong as you will find tons of pretty decorated cafes, 90's arcade room, place to rent Hanbok (Korean traditional dress), and many more. Another place to visit Hanok Village if you have no time to go to BukchonFun Fact : The Ikseon Hanok Village itself is older than Bukchon!Have to do : Take as many as pictures you can. Feel the tradition vibe!"

Don't forget to sip a nice & aromatic Korean traditional tea in the traditional tea house and also queue up for the famous mandu (dumpling) restaurant in the vicinity."
