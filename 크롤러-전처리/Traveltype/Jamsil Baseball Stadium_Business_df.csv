0,5.0,It was a lot of fun going to a baseball game in Korea. It is a lot different than attending a game in the U.S. The fans are very animated! Lots of cheering and booing and singing. It was a blast seeing the difference.
1,4.0,"Stadium is right on the Metro line, is well maintained, food is inexpensive and tickets are cheap.  Fans make for a fun and interesting game day experience.The quality of play is Minor League AA/AAA level and you might recognize a few American and Dominican players who have had a cup of coffee in MLB...Scott Copeland and ex-Blue Jay pitched for the LG Twins the night we were there.Only drawback is that the seats are a little tight for big American bodies!"
2,5.0,The crowd was beyond the best part (beside the Chicken and Beer)! There was so much unity and light!
3,5.0,"This is my second trip to Seoul for business so I decided to venture out and try something new. Since I was just at an MLB game in the US, I decided to go watch a pro game (LG Twins) while in Korea by myself. It did not disappoint. I highly recommend sitting in the home team's section, which is on the first base line. Be adventurous and sit in or near the main cheer section, which is located in 207. I sat in 205 row 4 and was quickly befriended by some regular fans sitting around me (as my picture can attest). They made me feel right at home and for 4 hours, I forgot about everything but the moment and trying to soak it all up."
4,5.0,"Watching Korean baseball in this stadium was fun and easy.  Buying tickets outside was easy, although the games are usually very busy, some walkup tickets are always available before each game.  You can buy food and beverages outside the stadium and take them in, plus food inside is reasonably priced.  I recommend at least one game to any baseball fan."
