0,3.0,"This is three buildings built on Hangang(Han River). It's consistently advertised as brand new landmark of Seoul. Not that many people are interested and have visited by the way.- Not easy to reach by public transportations. There's a shuttle bus delivering people on specific times. It's not crowded normally.- Buildings look expensive. That's it. There aren't many things to have fun inside. There are kids' plaground, convenience stores, wedding halls, etc.- It'll be the best to visit in the early morning as the lights turn on and the sunset goes.- Little fancy boats seemed popular. But, there's no one having them when we visited."
1,4.0,"This is not necessarily marketed as a 'tourist attraction', but we were recommended to visit Some Sevit (세빛섬) to take advantage of the lovely ambiance at night. It is not necessarily the easiest place to get to, but it is about a 15 minute walk from Express Bus Terminal station. It was a nice area with bike lanes and open space for everyone to have a nice stroll by the Han river - I could imagine this being a popular destination during the summer. The three floating islands were beautifully lit in various colours and changing patterns. Night view was spectacular and a great photo opp."
2,3.0,"It was cold outside with wind, but I felt that it would be good for having some time with friends or family in that area. Sebitseom(""seom"" means island. In this case, islet) is a connected artificial islet that consisted with three structures. Gabit, Solbit and Chaebit. ""Se"" of ""Sebitseom"", I guess this would be their intention, means ""three(3)"" in Korean. We could find some restaurents, gallery, convenience store. Actually we visited an exhibition on ""artists of Impressionism"", and the place looks good for a small exhibition. It seems that many would love to visit there at twilight and enjoy breeze and openness of Han river in Spring and autumn."
3,4.0,It was nice to have a dinner and enjoy Han river. But I think the place doesn't have its own colour. Another typical Korean dining and shopping areas... I think Seoul city official needs to be more strategic to plan this place.
4,4.0,"Had the chance to visit place during a City Tour Bus ride. While I didn't exactly love it, it was also great to see different sights apart from the usual Tourist Attraction."
