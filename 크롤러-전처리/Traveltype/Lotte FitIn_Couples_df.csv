Bought a shirt from Pigment, the male attendant went to put the sample back on the shelf but the lady told him not to bother even though she had new ones in the storeroom. I asked for a new one, she said yes and shoved the shirt in my face with the receipt without a bag. Pigment womenswear store on the ground level worst service ever! Donâ€™t go here."

There are floors dedicated for only ladies or gentlemen. 6th floor has Olive Young, Etude House, Club Clio and more cosmetics brands. 7th floor has a Korean and western buffet restaurant. 8th floor offers Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Korean food. It also has a UPS counter and a tax refund counter. Money exchange is available on the first floor. It is a great one-stop shop for souvenirs and the likes. Located right across the street from DDP and Am/pm residence."

They also have great wifi and internet (free) and easy subway access through the basement levels."

This store doesn't.BEFORE you buy, make sure you clearly ask what the rules are.  I found out the hard way.They posted all over the store that it is ""TAX FREE"".  It is not.One section said because I paid by credit card, she wouldn't give me the tax free form.Another store section said because it was a sale piece, you don't get tax free.The Lotte store in Jeonju-si, Jeollabuk-do has sales, let's you pay in any currency, and has a better tax-free recovery booth. GO THERE!!!"
