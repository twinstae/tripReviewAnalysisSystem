0,5.0,Grilled fish at Dongdaemun Grilled Fish Street. The cutlassfish (top piece) had an amazing natural sweetness and a soft texture.  The Spanish mackerel (bottom piece) had a â€˜mackeralâ€™ taste thatâ€™s much more fragrant than the usual mackeral we eat in sg. This was so good we came back the next day! And the whole meal for our family of 2 adults and 2 young kids only cost 18000 won!
1,5.0,We have been wanting to try grilled fish and search online and found there is a grilled fish street in Dongdaemun so decided to try since we are going there to shop.There were alot if grilled fish shop in the whole street. Initially we wanted to try the first store that we passed by cos the ahjumma was friendly and the restaurant seems busy. However decided to walk and see the rest. We then walked into one of the grilled fish restaurant but the attitude of the ahjumma was terrible so we walked out and went back to the first store. At least this one has menu with english and chinese wording.We ordered the grilled mackarel and stew and was so good. We finished everything and was glad to have tried grilled fish in seoul.

The place is pretty vibrant with lots of vendors grilling their fish outside their small restaurants. You can see workers pushing their trolleys with boxes of produce around here and the smell of grilled fish is very enticing.This street is a great place to see some local food culture and is very well located so after some serious shopping it is nice to stop here for a meal. Most of the vendors, many of them middle aged and older ladies, are friendly and some can speak English which was helpful.Prices are not expensive and the food tastes delicious."

Turn right and find a small alley - if itâ€™s a smokey alley you know you got it. The shops are small, if itâ€™s full, you might have to sit upstairs (shoes off) on the floor - itâ€™s all for the experience. Shop keepers are very friendly and accommodating. Very cheap and healthy food."
4,5.0,"There's a whole street of shops selling grilled fish. We order 3 fishes, Mackerel, Swordfish and a third fish that we weren't sure what it was. Nonetheless, it was good, fish was well grilled and tender. We spent about 26,000 won, which was due to choosing the unknown fish and swordfish which are more expensive. Staff couldn't speak english well though and there are no english menus, order by pointing at the fish you want. Staff could speak some mandarin though"
5,5.0,"Grilled fish is a better alternative to bbq beef amd pork-- healthier and  more reasonably priced ($30 vs $80). The market is lined with several fish restaurants, so use your gutfeel to choose the best griller who can entice you to come inside their place."

7,4.0,Halal food for Muslims since it is Grilled Fish. Went there twice because of the food. It is truly the best!Very cheap compare to other halal restaurants. If you go there please do order the Grilled Fish & also the Sundubu Jiggae. Worth the money.The hospitality from the owner of the shop also was tip-top!Would definitely go there again.
8,4.0,"Have been to the grilled fish street twice. Very inexpensive, good food. We chose to stop at a couple different shops to compare...it was all good. Service could've been better as they monopolize how u can order trying to manipulate u to order more. There are also establishments that offer chicken soup in the same alley where they serve an entire chicken boiled in a savory broth with rice cakes, potatoes, mushroom and veggies. There was an establishment out of character with the rest of the alley at the very end which I thought was rather a damper but just don't wander down that far and u should be good."
9,4.0,"A Must-Try for Foodie!True local fare offering taste of different type of grilled fishes, served with rice and side dishes. We ordered 3 servings (1 fish per serving) of different fishes for the family, costing abt 7,000 won per serving (quite affordable). And all gone in 15 min...our kids took to it like a fish to water ðŸ˜€. We regretted not trying the other assortment of fishes before flying off.Grilled fish street is where we saw many locals eat...good place to just soak in the local ambience (Gwangjang market is another). The place (which operates from 6.30am to 7-8pm) is walking distance (5-7min) from our hotel in Dongdaemun but also easily accessible via their subway (Line 1).Will come again."
