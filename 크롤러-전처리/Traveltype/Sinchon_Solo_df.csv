Surround yourself with young, hip and energetic people.-accessible by nearby subway stations and bus stops-going to and from the Incheon Airport is easy using the 6002 bus. -restaurants and street food vendors are everywhere. Never be hungry. ðŸ˜˜-street performers come out at night-make-up and skincare stores are all over but not as crowded as Myeongdong"

This bus converted into a music club, DJ booth and reading area. I wish they have all the latest Kpop music. It is pretty cool to check it out though if you are shopping in the area."

You will be able to see many shops selling similar design of clothes and bags and shoes in other places but much more expensive. But here, price is good! Street food is good too:)) but prepare to walk and walk and walk as this place is long and big. Remember to exercise self-control too!"

Many university around this area, most popular is Ewha Women's University, my friend said this place became shooting location of some music video clip & film. Hotel & backpacker hostels also quite cheap. If you are fashion lovers, you definately must visit Sinchon where you can find many funky clothes, shoes, bags etc with student price. Cafes, clubs, bars, street foods & restaurants are in every corner. If you are an explorer you may find some hidden fabolous spots. I would say this place is never sleep :)"

8,5.0,I stayed in a guesthouse around this place and I find it to be a fun place to be at.  It can get a little loud because of the hundreds of restaurants and bars surrounding our guesthouse but you will never get bored. U-Plex Mall is only a stone throw away and hundreds of restaurants to choose from.  I had better meals here than in Myeongdong. Close to buses and subway too.

Plenty of mobile phone shops for those who want to get a prepaid card. Students, yes you can get what you need there. Cafes, one of the highlight, lots of nice cafes there. Mostly 2-3 levels.
