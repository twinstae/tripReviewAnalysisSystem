0,5.0,This Hanok village is easy to find and is walking distance from my hotel. The heritage houses are well maintained and is good to visit inspite of being free access
1,4.0,"The village is very pretty but pretty small. We were nearby and decided to take a stroll inside but did not book any of the activities offered (archery making, tea ceremony, costume rentals, etc). We visited on a Friday morning and it was quiet and empty. Ended up sitting by the pond for an hour and enjoying the nice day and atmosphere."
2,4.0,"After walking Namsan Park, we happened upon a pathway to take us back to our hotel which cut through the Namsangol Hanok Village area.  On the day we visited, there was a free exhibition and we took advantage of the opportunity to look at both exterior buildings and the interiors."
3,4.0,"My partner and I had spent a couple of hours around Gwangjiang Market, and decided to walk the 2+ kilometeres back to our hotel on the western edge of Myeongdong. As we are want to do, we like to make the occasional detour if we think a street, or distant object/building might hold some interest. Such was the case as we were returning to our hotel. We came across the entrance to this traditional Village and park, and ended up spending more than an hour wandering around the traditional buildings, and the large park at the rear.We were not able to get into many buildings, and the one building complex that looked interesting happened to be conducting a wedding reception on the day of our visit, which meant we were not permitted to enter anyway. On the day of our visit there were some temporary food stalls operating, and I got the impression from some signage that this park and the architected surrounds/seating etc. at the northern end that the Seoul Food Festival was to be held on this site.We enjoyed our time at this site, and provides the ability to take some really wonderful photos, of the Hanok Village buildings themselves, the large park at the rear, and the higher levels of the park provide some pleasant views of the nearby city areas as well. A relaxing and pleasant place to visit."
4,4.0,Nice historic park for learning about ancient Korean lifestyles and living. Surrounding park has nice trails.  Many local weddings take place here.  Relaxing place to spend an hour or two.
5,4.0,This is a relaxing and great place to visit in the afternoon. It is easy to navigate and very clean. An audio tour is recommended to get the beautiful history and background on this lovely site.
6,4.0,"Namsangol is a sprawling open space, great for kids to run around freely. There's definitely less tourists here, so taking pictures is easy. Unlike Bukchon Hanok Village where you have to mind your voice volume in respect to the residents, few guests get annoyed by noise here. It's a pretty quiet park, because that's how it feels like to me."
7,5.0,It's free to go in. It's huge and beautiful. It's connected to the park where you can also seethe Seoul Tower from afar. They have lots of free programs you can attend - interactive or just to watch and learn. Lots of traditional games you can play.
8,5.0,A great way to preserve the old buildings and you can also do calligraphy classes here to very picturesque
9,4.0,Well done exhibits of typical Korean life from the rural past. Homes have been reconstructed. See the earthenware pots where beans are fermented. Homes and furnishings are on display. Interesting place to walk around for a bit. In the heart of Seoul so access is fairly easy. Lots of other activities on the grounds as well.
10,4.0,"If the weather is good, I'll recommend a visit to this place. The architecture is lovely and a lot of the houses have rooms decorated in traditional style, allowing you a peek into Korea's past. It's not a 'walk in and look' - you can stand outside the door and look in, craning your neck around the sometimes dark corners. But there are plenty of signs explaining what you're seeing so you don't have to be well-versed in any history beforehand (although it definitely makes the experience better).We arrived towards the end of the day when everything was being packed up. I imagine it's more lively in the late morning/early afternoon when activities take place, stalls are open outside the main gate, and people walk around in traditional dress. But if you've been slowly walking the area like us, I'd still suggest to drop by. It's a very lovely area with a nice park just next door that makes for a nice stroll. There is also a gift shop which, surprisingly, has some nice and affordable souvenirs. I am not sure if this is an attraction I would've gone out of my way to reach - which we definitely had. But if you have the time, and if you're interested in seeing what Korea looked like before, then do find a nice day and go."
11,3.0,"The weather was nice, so it was beautiful to walk around and take some pictures of the nearby garden and small river that runs through. Otherwise a bit boring, but if you pass by anyway have a look."
12,4.0,"Namsangol Hanok Village offers few things to the visitor to learn about Korean culture such as Hanbok fitting, archery making, rice cake making or tea ceremony experience by paying a bit of cash. There is no entrance fee if u just want to explore and see. The hanok setting is very nice and you can learn how the traditional Korean house back then. Fortunately if you go in Spring time, u may see a bit of Cherry Blossoms as well as the other pretty flowers. If you go deep down to the center of the park you will find Seoul's Thousand Years Time Capsule which they burried in 1994 to celebrate Seoul's 600th years anniversary which contains cultural properties. It will be open in 2394 in celebration of Seoul's 1000 years anniversary."
13,5.0,"Beautiful area to walk around, it's very scenic with the traditional houses and the background of the Seoul industrialized city! Information/tourist booths can be found scattered around with maps and suggested directions to walk around the area. It is hilly, which I personally love, but could be hard on people who have any knee/leg/feet/etc. issues. There are tea shops scattered about and other stores as well. We had tea at a fantastic tea shop along the path!"
14,4.0,‰æÜÂçóÂ±±Ë∞∑ÈüìÂ±ãÊùëÈÄõÈÄõÈüìÂúãËÄÅÂª∫ÁØâ.  This is a reserved village for traditional Korean houses.  The outlook of the houses are very Chinese house like.   But the inside is more Japanese oriented (this is my be due to that Korea was once the colony of Japan).  It‚Äôs definitely a good spot to visit in Seoul.
15,4.0,"Very cool attraction - also it‚Äôs free! The houses are very well preserved, and it‚Äôs cool to walk around and see."
16,5.0,"We visited Namsangol Hanok Village on a weekday morning in summer. Beautiful garden with lots of ponds, pavillions and of course the traditional hanok village.A big place to walk around and a good place to learn about Korean Seoul culture. Definitely should visit Seoul Millennium Time Capsule where they buried 600 items in 1994 and to be opened 400 years later. What a romantic idea!We enjoyed walking around the Hanok village where there are different styles of traditional houses.Apparently, there are some ceremony, performances and hands-on activities for the visitors throughout the week. Be sure to check out their website before you visit if you like to experience more. A perfect place to spend a peaceful day in Seoul."
17,5.0,"This village is good for seeing historical Korean buildings. It offers free 40 minute tours in a range of languages (Chinese, English, Korean and Japanese).  Check before you go what days and times have your language."
18,5.0,"We visited here using the subway and exited at Chungmuro station. Entrance was free and it was a beautiful place to visit. We had a nice look around. You can even see the N Seoul Tower from here.  Plenty of tourists but the place was interesting nevertheless. Many well-preserved hanoks, pavilions etc."
19,5.0,"We thought it would be just a simple historical stroll through and head to namsan in the evening and end the night in Myeongdong. Well, the place is beautiful as you take in the gorgeous surrounding , landscape, historical structure and just the vibe on the place. The small details was what interest hubby and i . Beside the pond there are batches of small strawberries growing in the flower beds, and we notice some herbs here and there too.. When you walk around you will see pine cones which the shape is something Ive never seen , some kind of berries (which i wasn't sure can be eaten or not) and just the flowers are beautiful. Take Ur time and breath in the fresh air and somehow the place exudes calmness. I like that there will be a corner for anyone to try some local traditional games. The only setback is would be awesome if there was someone to explain the game to us or maybe they should put some multi-language boards on instructions of games . Lolz.. TIPS: its free to enter, Its a beautiful,place for a picnic soooo many places for some down time.. Theres a Gimbap store directly at the road leading to NamsanGol... Absolutely love their prawn kimbap and kinchi jigae... Yums!! We even take away 2sets of Gimbap for later... Enjoy!!1"
20,5.0,"Absolutely amazing place to discover Korean tradition. You do not pay any fee to enjoy this place, but the traditional green tea do not taste nice for many people..."
21,4.0,I came here in 2016 and it was much quieter. It has now been built upon and more houses added. This old hanok village is not its original site. It's a beautiful serene place though especially the stream and rockery. Ideal picnic place. Free city wifi can be picked up here if you cannot pull yourself away from Facebook üòÇ
22,4.0,"Very interesting to visit thus village with traditional Korean living, a bit hard to find from our tour stop but defibately worth a visit."
23,5.0,These are beautifully restored historical buildings that are mostly residential.  Go there first thing in the morning when the sun is best for taking photographs and before the tour groups arrive.
24,4.0,It's nice to see the older part of town but important to remember that people live here. We were informed that the locals are afraid to leave their doors open as tourists simply step inside not realizing these are private homes.
25,5.0,This is a great place. Peaceful and full of history. Located by Chungmuro Station. Nice view of the Seoul tower
26,5.0,"This recreation of a traditional Korean village has free shows, plenty of refreshment stands, historic recreations and is also the home to many Korean TV shows.  If you have a Korean friend be sure to get some photos with the cut-outs of the current TV Soap Opera locations, they will be so envious!We found the folk dancing attraction especially fun.  The dancers performed amazing feats of body control, and even though the Korean music is s little jarring to western ears it was truly worthwhile, and its free, along with several other performances."
27,3.0,Not a must-see in my opinion but worth going to if you're already in the vicinity. Neat to walk around and see the traditional houses but when we were there there was hoards of tourists so it was hard to enjoy it or even get a good photo.
28,5.0,The traditional houses are very interesting. When you visit the place be courteous to people living in the community.
29,3.0,"We went to N Seoul Tower and Namsan Park so Namsangol Hanok Village was on our way. We liked the cute little village. If you are short of time, you can see (maybe fewer but equally impressive) hanoks by Gyeongbokgung Palace."
30,4.0,"This is a good place to come and see the houses with furniture in. So many of the museums show the houses as empty, but here they have collected together typical furniture so give a more complete look at how the people lived. Live 3 or 4, stn: Chungmuro exit 3. Free entrance."
31,5.0,This village is a created area. The houses have been moved to the site. You can therefore see inside the houses. There are explanations and workshop areas.
32,4.0,"When the location is only 5 minutes walk from the place i stay in chungmoro, it's easy to reach. It's beautiful during the winter as the snow covers the roofs and giving great views for photos. But it was too cold during my short visit to this village as i only manage to wander around for only 30 minutes."
33,3.0,"This is a free open-air museum located a short walk from exit 3 of Chungmuro station. Dont walk to the Korea house!There are five houses transplanted here. They are suppose to represent the homes of people of the different social classes during the Joseon period of Korea's history. Over weekends there are expected to be renactments of traditional Korean wedding around noon, so time your visit!Because there is no guided tour of the place, you are pretty much on your own. The Hanok village museum is part of a larger park. Sometimes there are cultural performances. Overall it is a good place to get an appreciation of traditional homes. Elsewhere, you either pay or it is a real residential area and cannot easily access. Real Hanok villages are well outside in the rural, so this gives a nice introduction."
34,5.0,A man-made korea cultural village. Full with different kind of buildings and tools which imitate ancient Korea village. Hanbok can be rented here for  experience and photography.
35,5.0,"In the middle of Seoul, The Korean government brought together 5 traditional houses to help people remember their past. Well worth a visit. Entrance is free. There are students who have assignments to act as guides. Free of charge."
36,5.0,"This peaceful village is a wonderful spot to encounter traditional Korean culture. It features five types of  houses from the Joseon era, that have been relocated here from different parts of Seoul. The entrance to the Namsangol Hanok Village is free, but the activities come with a small chargeable fee."
37,5.0,We took an hour long free tour in English and were the only two people on the tour. Our guide was very knowledgeable and explained many interesting things about the buildings but also about Korea itself. I'd recommend getting a tour as the signage on the site is good but limited. The guide brought it to life.
38,4.0,"We wanted to watch the Martial arts show. Pretty easy to reach from the subway stop, about 2 short blocks. Nice there is no admission price. Took lots of photos. Oppressively hot and humid, not much shade nor air conditioned places to pop in to cool off. The lake was pretty. The show was good, but quite staged, set to music, lots of board breaking.  Would be a good circus act."
39,5.0,"Namsangol Hanok Village is a reconstruction of a number of traditional Korean houses, put together like a genuine village. Admission is free, and visitors can wander round the outer precincts, from which colourful interiors can be viewed. There is a charge, however, if one wants to try on traditional costumes, participate in a tea ceremony, or have a conducted tour. One can take a head-in-the-hole photograph without payment, and pretend to be a traditional Korean villager or a Confucian scholar. There is also a tasteful gift shop and a caf√©.The grounds also contain a time capsule, where typical objects from our present time were buried in 1994, not to be reopened until the year 2394.It is best visited on a dry day. There is a large covered booth near the entrance, overlooking a small lake with lotus flowers, but most of one‚Äôs visit involved walking around in the open. Our visit was on a rainy day, but we enjoyed it nonetheless."
40,4.0,"It is a beautiful village that gives you a feel of what life was like back in the days. The structures are beautiful, the gardens are beautiful, there are quite a few fun and cheap activities to participate in. We tried the tea ceremony, which is a one on two experience where a staff member brewed you a pot of tea and offered you a couple of different sweet snacks inside one of the buildings. Ok, the snacks were that good but it was the experience I was buying. For a small fee, we also had the chance to put on traditional Korean clothing (quite a few selection to choose from) and posed for pictures inside another building. I recommend going there early so there are fewer people. We get to experience the above activities on our own without other people in the way. Just after we finish with our traditional clothing, a few groups of people were already there waiting and ""fighting"" over their preferred clothes. Another activity I wanted to try was the brush calligraphy session but for some reasons, it wasn't available until a couple of days later. I didn't realise there are seasons to calligraphy writing... Anyway, overall it was a great place to visit, I recommend this place over the Gyeongbokgung Palace."
41,4.0,We took the English tour given by a delightful woman.  She explained each of the buildings and explained the traditional beliefs and culture of that time. Just outside the village you can take the number 2 bus up to the top of nearby Mt. Namson to visit the Namson Seoul Tower to save you time and a long walk up.
42,4.0,"The old buildings in this park are well preserved and there are English signs that explain the information about the buildings. The park is also beautiful and relaxing (but avoid weekends, it gets crowded). It is free and a nice stop on the way to Namsam Mountain or the nearby Myeong-dong shopping area. Price is FREE!!"
43,5.0,This historical site consists of a group of hanoks that were moved to the park. The park is a peaceful respite at the north edge of Namsam Park. The hanoks are well-refurbished and furnished to give a real feel for the era. We greatly enjoyed are stroll through the place. It can easily be done in 1-2 hours.
44,4.0,Visited here as part of a tour. It was very interesting but I've heard that the Bukchon village is better and has traditional crafts and tea shops. Overall interesting.
45,3.0,"I only had an afternoon to spend freely, so I was debating between this place and the other Korean village place in Samcheongdong/Bukchon (more famous/popular), this place was closer to where I was staying so I decided to go. It is is free of entry, and there are activities (fees apply) related to Korean culture you could pay a reasonable fee to enjoy. But this place was actually smaller than I expected and I didn't find it too interesting."
46,4.0,"Treat it as a walk in the park but the bonus would be the opportunity to look inside authentic old houses and ponds at the same time. As this is a tourist attraction, buses with tourists would appear."
47,4.0,Peaceful glimpse into the history of South Korea.  Had a great time seeing the arts and artifacts.  Cool to see the architecture in the middle of Seoul.  Bathrooms are not the best though
48,3.0,Looking for a place to see how Koreans lived before? Check this place out. Some houses were that of nobles and influential people in their society. Traditional Korean houses and way of life are also displayed. There's a coffee and souvenir shop near the entrance in case you want one.
49,4.0,"nice view of the building architectures, the hanbok experience is no longer free, charges at 20,000KRW. surprise to feel that olden Koreans are small in size, the doors and stairs look tiny for the Koreans nowadays."
50,5.0,This village is assembled from old houses around Seoul that needed to move. It's a lovely collection of best old architecture set up in a lovely garden. I particulary enjoyed the Korean games you can try in different places. Unfortunately the Taekwndo Show only starts in May so we missed that.
51,4.0,I surprise they allow people to visit this place free. It's a nice place to visit and look at how the old houses in the village looks like. Pretty nice visit.
52,5.0,"It has quite a lot to look around. It was well equipped and well maintained. It is free, and worth  visiting."
53,4.0,"If you would like to see how the (probably rich) Koreans lived back in the days, then this is the place to visit. The attraction is free, and you can roam around the 5 abodes. It was supposed to be a time filler but we were pleasantly surprised."
54,4.0,"To visit this place you can take bus 05 and stop at Namsangol Hanok Village. take a walk around 150m and you will find the gate to enter this village. This place is free of charge. Inside the village you could see traditional old Korean house, park, etc. It is a must visit place for people that like historical place"
55,4.0,"This place is big! It's not just a good area to sight see but would also be a good place to hang out and just enjoy the view or go for a walk. Here, you can take a glimpse of how people in Korea used to live. You can see what the houses look like and what it has inside as well."
56,2.0,There is a tourist office close to the Metro exit. Go in and get a map of the area. We found the lady in the Tourist office very helpful and her English was good.Honestly the houses were very beautiful but not a lot to see or do. There are Hanok houses on two sides of the road. Once you walk around and take a few pictures then you are done.When started on the same side as the tourist office and then cross over and finished on the higher ground. There are steps at the top which lead down to a street which is really arty and has lots of places to eat. We went to the first Korean place we met and had a great meal for small money.
57,5.0,Forget about the boring and uninteresting Bukchon Village. This is the one you want to see. Many houses of the olden corean days. Very nice walk. Highly recommended.
58,4.0,It's a lovely village but nothing to do that much. Nice place to take a photo and look at old village style of korea
59,4.0,"A small village in the middle of Seoul,about a 10 minute walk from Myeongdong Station.Interesting Hanoks and you can participate in various activities if you wish to.We were very lucky as the Korean show Infinity Challenge was filming there and we were able to watch and see some of the celebrities."
60,4.0,"I went there during winter and it was freaking cold, but the snowy view here was priceless. Ice houses were built during this season and you could take lot of good photographs. There were a lot of traditional houses that could be explored and they're well-maintained even those houses were built thousand years ago from Joseon Era, but I still could feel the original and the beautiful scene. Namsan Hanok Village can be accessed by taking metro Line 3 or Line 4 to Chungmuro Station Exit 3 or 4"
61,5.0,"Original houses in near-original condition. You must have or join a (free) tour guide. The buildings represent the heart of Korea. Under-floor heating, for example, has influenced how they sit, eat and sleep, and socialise. Even the curve of the familiar curved roof ridges differentiate them from similar Chinese and Japanese buildings, in an idiosyncratically Korean way."
62,3.0,The only reason why I'm going here because it is within walking distance from my hotel. Just an average experience. Nothing special.
63,5.0,This is located in the center of Seoul and can feel the real old Korea style. It is good to walk
64,4.0,I went there at night time around 6p.m and it was kind of scary because at that time there was no one there and there were just empty buildings all around you. My advice for you is to go there during day time.
65,3.0,"Not that attractive compared to Bukchon. More on a ""man-made"" Hanok Village. Nothing much to see. If you are pressed with time, you can actually let go of this."
66,5.0,"Traditional Korean Village, This village has five restored traditional Korean houses and a pavilion, a pond, which make it a perfect spot to take a walk.There are spots where on the ground traditional games are made. During the weekends, traditional marriages are shown at Bak Yeong Hyo's Residence. The groom and bride in traditional attire, you can quickly grab a foto with them.We loved this place!"
67,3.0,Suggested by our guide. It was relaxing but I think there are other attractions more interesting. We saw the old ways to make Kimchee.
68,4.0,We did a tour go during the week less visitors . Our guide was very informative with the history of hanok . The houses had been shifted there from another place . It gave you a inside view of how they slept cooked and lived life in there village years ago
69,4.0,Free entry. Easy to get around. Not sure how wheelchairs manage the high step in to each area We walked to this coming down from the Seoul tower through Namsan park  and then back to exit12 beside hotel Also plenty of water toilets and outdoor exercise  equipment Hilly and many steps
70,5.0,"I'm visit two of Hanok village at Seoul, this place better than the other one (Buckcon). But, Namsangol is like a museum, there's not a real village as at Buckcon. But, you can taking a photo better than because the buildings looks real. suggest for visiting in the morning, not to crowded and you can enjoy the garden."
71,4.0,"Within a short walk from Chungmuro Subway (exit 3 or 4) this ""village"" is well worth a visit. Various traditional style houses are displayed in a well planned park with some water flows nicely landscaped. Good place to stroll around leisurely, taking in some historical background of Korean life. There are periodic guided tours in different languages. According to the brochure I picked up the park is closed every Tuesday and if Tuesday happens to be a holiday, next day too. Other days the park opens by 9am and closes at 9pm (8pm during winter months). One can easily spend anything from 2 to 4 hours depending how much you want to take in. There is also a Korean traditional medicine clinic within the park where you are invited for a cup of Korean tea and a free health check. In approximately 30 minutes or so young ladies/men, dressed in traditional and colourful costume, will take some information about your physical health, take some readings (with the help of modern aids) and take you to the traditional doctor for a quick review. The doctor will explain what is best for your health and leave you, if required, with a small dose of traditional medicine for the next two days. Everything is free and there is no hidden agenda. Well done! Korea."
72,4.0,"We have a luck to see beautiful fiance and her groom in this nice place with old stile Korean houses, households utensils, national clothes."
73,5.0,"This will give you a better context of how people in older times lived. A bit commercial though. Overall, I like this better than the other village since we can see the inside of the structures."
74,5.0,"We loved it! Really close to the train station, and for that reason it's not out of the way in Seoul. Free. Yes, there are some old houses which you are expecting to see, but what was good for us was the surprises, the time capsule, the couple having wedding photos in traditional dress, the Korean guys havng a coffee and chat in the park. Mix with the locals and tourists, see traditional Korean buildings interposed with Koreans on their lunch break enjoying the relaxing park right in Seoul. Allow at least an hour. Plenty of spots to have a rest and a snack. Coffee for sale at the cafe."
75,4.0,"Many cool houses and some informational boards that teach you about old Koreans houses.There were many trees and a little stream that would probably be beautiful in summer, but it looked quite sad in winter. There weren't many people either."
76,4.0,I wouldn't say it's a must see but if you do the city tour bus you could get off at this stop and have a quick look. It's free so why not?
77,3.0,"Traditional touristic place in Seoul. You must have visited Hanok Village, but that's it. There is so many to do in Seoul, that we did not spend too much time here. Also, a lot of people visiting this place, so it can be crowdy. Many school groups, tourists, ..."
78,5.0,"This small village situated at the foot of Namsan, contains beautiful examples of yangban houses which are furnished in the period style. It is interesting just walking around and taking in the relaxed atmosphere."
79,5.0,The entrance is free. You can rent Korean Traditional Costume with variety of designs at 3500 won. Free herbal tea is available for all visitors. The traditional houses are well-maintained
80,4.0,"We went to Namsangol Hanok Village in summer (June 2014). It was an amazing experience for me because I got the chance to see an old-fashioned Korean village in person, instead of watching them on tv (Korean Drama such as Iljimae, The Princess' Man, Arang & the Magistrate, etc). Yes, I'm a bit of Korean Drama fan especially the Sageuk kind ;) More over, the entrance was free! Yes, free! You don't have to spend any won to enter the village. Even though, we walked a few km to reach it, but it was well worth my time. My hubby even got the chance to play one of the old-fashioned games there."
81,5.0,"The village is lovely, traditional hanok houses and a nice park. It has good infrastructure with enough restrooms. We went there on a Sunday and school children volunteered as free English tour guides (about 1 hour, we didn't take one because we did not have enough time). I think they want to practice English, it seemed like a school program.The best part for us was the Taekwondo foreigner experience program. You have to sign-up in advance via taekwonseoul.org and I think it costs around 35,000 KRW per person but it was really worth it. The trainer (from famous Kukkiwon) was great and made it a lot of fun. Still we got a good insight into Taekwondo.Afterwards there is also a free Taekwondo show that is really really impressing. You can check the schedule at the above mentioned website."
82,4.0,"Namsangol Hanok Village is a traditional village set up with well-preserved Korean-style houses, called the hanok. Old household items are displayed in traditional houses to recreate a village of the Joseon Dynasty. There are also cultural experience activities organized in the village. The entrance to the Namsangol Hanok Village is free, but the activities come with a small chargeable fee.Guests can tryout Korean traditional costumes too. The fee is KRW3,300 per person.More on my blog:http://www.kenwooi.com/2013/10/namsangol-hanok-village.html"
83,5.0,"I love this place, & was lucky that cherry blossoms were still blooming at the park during my visit. Good place to learn about cultural stuffs & there is also Hanbok costume wearing with a minimal fees. Best part it is free. My suggestion would be go to this village first & after you are done, go to the bus stop outside the hanok village & get on bus no 2 directly up to Namsan Tower"
84,4.0,"If you're planning to have a peaceful or romantic night, this is the place to be. The palaces are good too but they close at 6pm. We went to Hanok Village around 8pm. The place closes at 9pm. Hanok village is very serene and tranquil at night. I suggest you explore the villages first (turn left when you enter the main gate). You can either wind down inside the time capsule (top most part of the park) or at the pond near the main entrance. The place is really quiet and ambient at night."
85,3.0,"We went to the Hanok village as I thought we should have a feel of how the folk villages in Seoul were like. I was quite impressed by how the old villages were set out, but I suppose we saw a similar one while touring the secret garden of Changdeokgong. Once you've seen one, you've seen them all."
86,5.0,I was surprised to get to that lovely place for free. We visited ancient Korean houses. The village can be treated like a park. I guess it is even more beautiful in late spring or summer than in March.
87,4.0,"This was a comforting place to stopover. The village had a distinct old-school feeling. Most of the architecture here was constructed way before the modernization swept the place. Nevertheless, if you don't like that kind of things, then this place isn't worth it. But I found it to be a comforting place in a busy city."
88,4.0,This is the place to see if you are not traveling outside S√©oul. The village is a perfect place to roam around and exploring the traditional Korean houses. The village also conducts a free demonstration of Taekwondo but not every day. You can also play games if you want to do some activity.  I was lucky to witness a traditional Korean marriage ceremony which was wonderful. The place is good to stroll around and I had a great time.

90,4.0,The place is a must visit during winter. The snow covered village is a sight to behold. It is like a view taken out of a postcard or painting. It is very beautiful. :-)
91,5.0,Quite a few traditional buildings.  While we were there they had ice sculptures in the village.  No entrance fee.  You are free to wander around the village and look in the various houses they have on the site.
92,4.0,"I enjoyed Namsangol Hanok Village not just for the traditional architecture and buildings, but it is also decorated with what was once how Koreans lived. They have turned this village not just for tourists, but when I was there, there were local events being held, and school trips, and children playing. With all the local activities organized in this place, it gives the place far more life than one of the palaces which I visited. There are also demonstrations of some traditional arts and crafts."

94,4.0,"Folk village has much more of what this place has, but this is worth a look. It has preserved some of the actual old houses of nobility and it is free to look. The village is quite small, but is well arranged."
95,5.0,"I love imagining how people lived long ago and that's why I found this so fascinating.  There are 5 traditional houses that have been restored and each one houses all the interior furniture.  You can picture how they lived in the olden days. It was really fun!  I understand on Saturday's and Sunday's they have entertainment.  I didn't have long to stay, but there were also classes that were going on that one can partake in.  Calligraphy, making kimchi etc."
96,5.0,A traditional Korea folk village. Spent around an hour strolling around here before catching our flight to Jeju. I like the peacefulness of this place and it is like traveling back to history and visiting someone in this village. Cool! & it is free.
97,4.0,"This is a free park that has rebuilt a typical Hanok village.  When we went they had a festival that let you pay a small fee to engage in activities from tea ceremony to painting.  Lots of free stuff as well.  This park has a lot of cherry blossoms so perfect to go during the cherry blossom season.  You probably don't need more than 1 hour here, but it has the best preserved village and you can see how Koreans lived in the old days.  Tip:  There is a Korea House cultural next door that is a place where many couples in Seoul have traditional marriages organized.  We were lucky enough to see one of a foreigner marrying a Korean.  Great photo opportunities.  Plus they have a very reasonable gift shop catering to tourists.Walking distance to Myeondong and also if you want to do the calbe car to Namsong Park Tower."

99,5.0,My husband and I visited Namsangoi Hanok Village in August of 2012. We were offered a free private tour given by two Korean middle school students who wanted to practice their English. It was terrific! They spoke excellent English and explained plenty of information about Korea's traditions and culture. It was such a benefit for us to have experts guide us through the village and it benefited the students by having a chance to practice their English. I thought this was a brilliant idea for the school to offer this service. We were shocked to find out that we were the students' first tour ever at this village and the only tour they had that day! They had done such a great job; I thought they had given numerous tours before ours. If you go to the village check to see if they are giving complimentary tours. They are well worth it! It was interesting to learn about Korea's past.
