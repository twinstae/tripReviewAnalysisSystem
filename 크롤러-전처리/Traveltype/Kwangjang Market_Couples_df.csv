0,3.0,"Lots of stalls selling common street food. Extremely crowded and be prepared for lots of shoving and pushing. Found a stall selling fish shape pancake or waffles. The couple manning the stall were very organised and thoughtful. Their pancakes had only three types of fillings - red bean, custard or pizza. Tried all three and would personally recommend the custard filling. They were very generous with the filings."
1,5.0,"We can‚Äôt get enough of the mung bean pancake. We had it twice during our visit. We also loved the mini kimbap. Their bibimbap was also quite good. If we go back to south korea, we are definitely including this market again in our itinerary. piannskitchen.com"
2,5.0,"We went there as part of our ""explore Seoul"" trip and it was worth it! The atmosphere and energy were unmatched. The ox head meat made it worth the hassle!"
3,4.0,Easy to find from subway exit 9. This market is busy with food stalls & lots of variety. An excellent way to try a little of different korean foods. Other stalls for a whole range of products & goods. Various lanes of stalls spread out so you come back to a central point then take the next avenue.
4,5.0,"We watched  Netflix show about street food of Seoul and it was a must do and see for us when we visited Seoul last week.  We managed to find the stall from the show which makes the famous mung bean pancakes ü•û. The market was so big and it felt like it wasn‚Äôt ending.  You can find anything there: food, clothes, fabric, sea food ... it‚Äôs definitely a must visit in Seoul as you will experience a real Korean culture."
5,4.0,"Came here for the knife cut noodles and mung bean pancakes. Loads of shops selling hanboks, traditional decorations and snacks."
6,4.0,"No, this is not an upscale, ultra-clean chain department store where credit cards are king -- it is a market with numerous food stalls are centered along the walkways and sellers of fish, produce, silk, souvenirs, kimchi, housegoods and junk line the walkways. For me, all the food looks alike but obviously some are better than others as they are very busy and others have no customers. When in Seoul, one really has to visit -- not necessarily buy, but at least visit."
7,4.0,"It is really just a market solely focused on FOOD! Wonderfully authentic and delicious Korean Food! The shop keepers are very friendly and welcoming and can speak a multitude of languages ranging from english, chinese and japanese, so communication really shouldn't be a problem no matter where you're from. All the food is fresh or made on the spot and you can see them prepare it. You can either take away the food or sit down at the stalls themselves to enjoy the food items. Price wise, it isn't expensive at all and you are utterly spoiled for choice of what to eat at Gwangjang market. There is a lot to see and observe and is a definite must-see location when in Seoul. I'd personally recommend ordering the kimbap, japchae, jajamyeon, pumpkin porridge, tobeokki and the kimchi pancakes!"
8,5.0,"Many stalls selling the same things, so pls read up or watch Netflix before going over. Have to try the mung beans pancake and knife noodles and dumplings. Go where the locals eat!"
9,5.0,"Although I hadn‚Äôt seen the Netflix special about this market, I loved the food and the fact that it‚Äôs not a tourist market. Well not yet üò≥Yes we ate at the now famous store and had dumplings which were amazing."
10,5.0,Full of local korean food like real live octopus!! A must try in Seoul!This is also the best place to buy food gifts to bring home. Bargain!!
11,4.0,This is a hugh marketplace selling all sorts of goods. If you are looking for affordable Korean souvenirs and gifts then you may want to pay a visit here and the kimchi prepared and sold by the ajumas (in sealed bags of 1/2 or 1kg packs) taste so good. There are also plenty of delicious traditional Korean food stalls lined throughout the entire place. The Hotteok (mugbean pancake is a must try here!)
12,5.0,"The two markets I visited in Seoul were Namdaemun and Gwangjang, both on a Saturday. I enjoyed Gwangjang the most. It was more crowded, especially in the afternoon. The street food style eating is much better than Namdaemun. There is everything you could want. We ate bimbap and tteokbokki while seated on a heated bench; 3000 won each and generous. At another stall, we ate a honey pancake. Delicious! Walked around for a couple of hours, including across the street where there are many climbing gear shops. Expensive, but fun to browse. One even serves beer and coffee. Look for the one called ‚Äúmygear‚Äù. Vas‚Äôs beer in a 16 oz glass is 3000 won. Coffee made to order. Very nice host. I would come back again and would recommend to friends."
13,5.0,This area is frequented by locals.You get to feel to local atmosphere in this market than the other markets in Seoul.Traditional Korean food is must to be experienced here.
14,5.0,Checking off my bucket list of eating live octopus... this place is filled with delicious made to order food.
15,3.0,"We were so looking forward to this. It did disappoint. May be because we were there in Feb, but we found it a bit lame. There is nothing special at this market that we can get anywhere else in Seoul. There is nothing really that would make us go there again."
16,4.0,"It's a huge market, fill with hanbok and clothes selection. Venture to the other side for hundreds of store selling the same thing. Pick your favorite auntie or lady and enjoy the food"
17,5.0,"This is a very good place to visit as there are food and clothes and all sorts of things. There are many nice foods , local korea food to try."
18,5.0,Loved this market where you can get chicken feet and octopus:) The vendors were nice and it was tasty.
19,5.0,"Absolutely loved our experience here. So many food options including dumplings, mung bean pancakes fish, doughnuts, red bean crepes, soups and everything in between. Go hungry! Would highly recommend"
20,4.0,"My partner and I had an afternoon free while in Seoul, and after checking some possibilities decided that Gwangjang Market appeared to be within a decent walking distance from our hotel on the western edge of Myeongdong.Using our trusty Google maps we set off... and what a journey that turned out to be. For some reason we found Google maps (normally very reliable wherever we travel...) tended to get a bit confused at times around Seoul...) to take us on a somewhat weird path to Gwangjang Market... down a variety of minor streets and laneways... on and on we walked, and walked, and walked... until FINALLY we located Gwangjang Market, and what we THOUGHT was a main entrance, off Cheonggyecheon-ro Street, so we entered.It is an indoor market, BUT... all we could see were aisles and aisle of what seemed to be mainly fabric, bedding, manchester, linen etc. shops and stalls, AND... they were almost all closed! What a disappointment, after having followed Google for maybe 25 minutes around strange streets. This certainly is a large market, somewhat along the lines of Chatuchuk Market in Bangkok. We checked down various aisle/passageways/arcades, but just more of the same, and virtually nothing open. But they weren't the types of stalls/shops we thought we would find here anyway.After several minutes of checking out various arcades, we were about to give up, when we decided to checkout way down the other end of a very long aisle of shops where there appeared to be some kind of a food shop open. And Hey Presto...!! Here was what we were looking for.It turns out the Gwangjang Market is more huge than we thought, and that there are apparently two main areas. The first being the more commercial area that we had encountered (off Cheonggyecheon-ro Street), and then at the other end of this huge complex, AND... with its own main entrance off Dongho-ro Street, was the market we thought we were to be visiting. Lots of unique food stalls and street food, bric-a-brac, fruit and vegetables, a huge variety of drink and ice-cream shops and stalls etc. etc. This part of the market is a huge market in its own right. And this part of the market was VERY busy when we visited. It appears to be more popular with the locals, with families buying treats, food, ice-creams etc. for their children, tourists sampling the street foods etc.From what we could gather, the more commercial part that we initially entered into is apparently only open certain hours or days of the week, whereas the part we now found ourselves in is apparently open every day. Eureka...! It wasn't a wasted day after all.I love to sample street food items in whatever country I am visiting, so this section of Gwangjang Market certainly provided a wide variety of options. Gwangjang Market is definitely worth a visit if you have a couple of hours to spare, excluding your travel time to get there. You could probably get away with an hour there, or you could easily stretch it out to at least two hours.Oh... and regarding travel time... We departed Gwangjang Market via the Dongho-ro Street entrance, and THIS TIME Google maps presented us with a much more direct, and more obvious route back to our hotel, which we could have done in almost half the time on the outward journey... except that we dropped off in the Myeongdong shopping streets for another look around, and to get dinner."
21,4.0,"When we were there, the locals definitely outnumbered tourists, which is a good thing. The buffet breakfast in our stomachs allowed us to take our time watching what eateries the locals were patronizing. They know what's good, so I'm following them. Obviously, we can't read Korean, so I just took pictures (see attached). The best pancakes seemed to be the one with the orange sign (says since 1994). We sat in front on the benches with tables, enjoyed our 4000 Won pancake while watching customers go in & out of the dine-in restaurant. Plus, many locals were buying takeaway plastic containers of uncooked pancake mix. Amazing, it's that popular! Then 2 different stall owners told us to eat the 2500 Won Japchae (transparent noodles with sesame oil and soy sauce) from this lady at stall #41. We just sat on stools holding our plates and watched this endless line of folks buying the 3 things they sold. We were also impressed how the 2 ladies left their money sitting in 2 bowls for all to see and everyone stayed honest!"
22,5.0,"At first, I walked around the fabric section of this market and then ended up in the food portion. I am a big foodie and instantly my eyes widened! Vendor after vendor, of seafood, fried food, vegetables, street food, etc.. I was in heaven. The stalls were pretty repetitive, but there is still a huge selection. I tried a few fried items first, delicious. After browsing the stalls I sat at one and ate a bowl of fresh Bibimbap. The bowl was filling and very affordable. The market itself was crowded obviously in the evenings, but there is plenty of room to look, sit, and eat! I recommend coming here for lunch or dinner at least once during a stay just to sample a variety of food items."
23,4.0,"Tons of street food stall selling similar traditional korean street food. Full of tourist during my visit. You can also find some shops selling clothes, snack, ginseng etc... in the area. But food is definitely the highlight here!"
24,3.0,"Nice to walk around the market place for city folks, but food wise nothing fantastic. Most stores sell almost the same food under the same section."
25,5.0,"We came to Gwangjang Market for lunch & loved it so much that we came back for breakfast on our last day in Seoul. We had the gimbap and bindae-tteok/mungbean pancake that the market are famous for. Both were great, we especially loved the mungbean pancake, with it's crisp golden outside & soft inside. We also had kalguksu/knifecut noodle soup with mandu/dumplings. It was fantastic! Would recommend Gwangjang Market to anyone who visits Seoul."
26,5.0,"We went there to experience different kinds of Korean street food. The place did not disappoint! Upon entering the market there are already few food stalls inviting you to buy their food but we kept patient and strolled more. Then we saw these lines of food stalls in the middle of the market offering different kinds such as dumplings, noodles, pancakes, chicken feet, rice cakes, and a lot more! We weren't able to try them all but our tummies were really satisfied. We will surely visit this again when we go back to Korea!"
27,5.0,"Authentic traditional market. Many local food to try on. Reasonable price. You can get many other things here beside local food. Clothes, daily groceries, hanbok, etc. Highly recommended."
28,3.0,"A market where locals shop is a must-visit on my list everywhere I go.  Although I am not sure I think I got a feel of that at Gwangjiang ( or Kwangjang) Traditional Market.  You can find anything you can think of, from food to household items.  A section of the market is dedicated to street food capably managed uniformly by older ladies who do not shy from fighting for your business. 3 items are ubiquitous‚Äî Korean sausage made of pork blood and sticky rice, japche stir fried yam noodles and vegetables, and rice cakes. A kiosks sell nothing but fried mung bean cakes. I cannot say they are the tastiest food I‚Äôve had but try them all, if only for the right to brag you have done it!  Then walk it off along the very pleasant Cheonggyecheon Stream nearby."
29,3.0,"Lots of vendors selling fabrics, clothes and food.  Pretty intense and overwhelming inside.  Food stalls were all the same.  Sellers were very pushy.  If you stop to look, they automatically try to hand you a menu and make you sit.  We had to keep on walking so that we wouldn‚Äôt feel pressured to buy, which didn‚Äôt allow us to focus much.  Once we decided to stop at one of the stalls and try out the pancakes, they brought out 2 when we only wanted one so we ended up having to pay for both.  Felt a little tricked because we‚Äôre foreigners.  Wanted to look at fabrics, but every time we would stop to check them out, we would get harassed by the sellers and when we‚Äôd decide not to buy, they‚Äôd get upset and start becoming unfriendly.  It got frustrating a bit.  We did checked out one souvenir shop where the seller was a very nice sweet older man.  Overall, it was an interesting place to see.  I would still recommend it."
30,4.0,"Huge market for foodstuffs, clothing and FOOD!Popularized by Runningman, celebrity chefs, and more, Gwangjang market gives a glimpse into what Korean food culture is like.Simply put... so much food! Bring enough cash! ...skip the dumplings"
31,4.0,"Coming from the US to Korea has shown us many things we never knew existed,  and many things done differently than we ever considered.  Gwangjang is one of those.  It is densely packed maze of little tiny shops and street vendors that is wonderful to explore.  The food vendors offer a wide variety of novel foods, prepared right in front of you.  The traditional clothing stores are dangerous to those of us with little will power and a love of cultural garb."
32,4.0,It is very interesting Korean traditional market where you can taste local street food. There are also a restaurants in the market where you can sit down and have a little more formal meal. The pity is that nearly all the food vendors are selling exactly the same traditional food. It would be nice to add some variety of modernized Korean food like what you can find in the other part of the city.
33,5.0,"Loved this place. Sights sounds and smells really make you come alive. The food was the main attraction for ourselves and this is in the centre of the market. Make time however,  to take in the fish, spice, kimchi and textile stores on route. There is a massive choice of places to eat, with each type of speciallity seeming to have the same location with different stall traders servicing the same option in each area. Prices are clearly shown and standard across the piece. Not as cheap as I expected but still much better than western prices. We chose to have just one type of dish (portion ) at each stall so we could try as many things as we could before getting full. Mung bean pancakes were our fav!4000 a portion. Bibimbap 5000 was really good. Fish cakes in a soup were nice at 3000. Sundae a blood sausage filled with spiced sweet rice were fantastic, they are served with cooked liver which reminded me of my child hood 6000. Bottled water is provided free - one central bottle from which you fill your own cup. Alternatively look for stores on the side selling Cass beer in small cans for 2000. Kimchi as usual was served complmentary. Didnt try any fish stuff as off to Busan later. Deffo a great place to try most of Koreas fantastic food in a great atmosphere."
34,4.0,"Gwangjang is na interesting place to visit. Big, chaotic, full of people, varied business. We had a great sushi in one of the small booths. Definitely worth a visit."
35,4.0,"Large local market provide food, gifts and Korean dress. Best place to see local things if you first visit Seoul."
36,3.0,"Gwangjang Market Is known to be one of the first permanent markets in Korea and is a popular tourist destination. The market is famous for its textiles; there are hundreds of stores that sell silk, satin, and linens. The stores here usually supply fabrics to the different market like in Namdaenum, Dongdaemun, and department stores.  Aside from the fabrics, this place is also known for their food. There are many food carts in the middle aisles selling different local dishes like bibimbap, dumplings, mung pancakes, live octopus, rice cake, blood sausage and a lot more."
37,3.0,"Visited Gwangjang 2 years ago and really liked it and went back this year. It didn't seem as impressive as before and the stalls were quite repetitive. We had some bibimbap at a stall then had some japchae - I ordered one portion and was served two miserable overpriced portions by the corner stall. Then we had mung bean pancakes. Interesting array of Korean street food, some of which are less common like the seafood dishes. It's a tourist trap so beware of upselling and some badgering."
38,2.0,"We heard great things about the market, went in the afternoon on a weekday. Lots of offer with loads of stalls but it‚Äôs all the same. Fish, vegetables and juices, or bedding. Depends what you like but I have been to much, much better markets unfortunately this one just wasn‚Äôt worth the train ride for us. If you like to take photos it‚Äôs a good spot I guess."
39,5.0,Easily to access via metro. Love the food here such as mungbean pancakes and other. Is full with tourist and foodssssssssss.
40,4.0,"A variety of Korean street food sold there - mandu, bibimbup, tokpokki, pancakes, noodles etc. Price is not really cheap though. Other sections sell textiles, snacks, souvenirs,hanbok etc. Interesting place to visit."
41,5.0,"Lots of stalls here selling hanbok, hanbok fabric and other stuff. Came here for the food. Food selection was varied and also very affordable! We sat at an ahjumma's stall and ate small kimbap, tteokbokki and jokbal. All were delicious! We loved the jokbal :) This ahjumma also serves live baby octopus and other food.At this market we also got to eat sundae, as well as fish cakes.We left with our tummies full! Definitely coming back here on my next visit."
42,4.0,Nice market with foods to choose from and textile and hanbok to choose from. There were many stalls that are selling same kind of foods around there. Lovely place with good food and some snacks or clothes to shop around.
43,5.0,"I felt that this market gave a true Korean experience. There are plenty of stalls (all serving slightly the same meals - bibimbap, gimbap, rice cakes, fish, etc) and you just take a seat and they serve you! Easy as that. It's a great place to meet locals, expats, people watch, and drink. It is complete chaos and super super busy but it is a really cool environment. I came here two nights in a row and will 100% be back. Truly authentic."
44,5.0,"We took the Seoul Metro to Jongno 5-ga Station. From there it's about a 5min walk to Gwangjang Market. The market has clothes and food merchants - we arrived just before lunchtime which enabled us to walk/explore without any issues. Once lunch begins, you will see workers from nearby offices/businesses flock into the market and sit at the various food stalls - usually a shared bench/table which surrounds the vendor stall. There's all manner of Korean food which caters to all different palates. The market also has a large number of Hanbok clothing stores which line the alleyways as well as stores which provide jewelry for the Korean weddings. There's also many men's suit and clothing shops where you can buy suit material or ready-made shirts if you desire. As you explore the many areas of the market, there's even live seafood shops which have produce available for purchase, as well as traditional Korean snacks. We had lunch at one of the many vendors and tried the bibim naemgyeon cold noodle dish and my wife had a noodle soup that had wide rolled noodles (made in front of your whilst you wait). If you love exploring, visit Gwangjang. It's also about a 15min walk to Dongdaemun area. Highly recommend visiting this market."
45,4.0,I like this place but never thought I like it enough to write a review until my most recent visit. I found myself naturally drawn to this place. I came to realization that you can find comfort in the food here. Some bread and butter shops may seem unexciting but it tells of the locals' life. Very interesting food options and excellent for the mini explorer in you.
46,3.0,Our guide said most of the goods here were lower end.    Liked seeing the fresh produce and fish for sale.   I was extremely surprised to see English translations of the offerings of the street food at many stalls.
47,5.0,"Huge market, many different things to try. Prepared right in front of you, it's difficult to choose at which store you want to sit down to eat... so I've been here a couple of times already haha."
48,5.0,"We had an amazing experience at the Kwang Jang street market. They have authentic Korean street food, a plenty of different small shops to explore and the atmosphere was great."
49,5.0,I really had a good time at Gwangjang Market. The food that they offered here was scrumptious. I really do enjoyed having a Hotteok and a Raw Octopus which is we eat it alive. The souvenir here was a bit cheap compared to Myeongdong and has various choices. What I can suggested if you guys go to this place please empty your stomach before you go here and try all the food in this place. It‚Äôs worth it.
50,5.0,"This is just one of those MUST DO items.  A great selection of local foods prepared right in front of you.  There are at least 100 vendors here with a great array of food, items and treats."
51,4.0,A market for food and fabric incredible large area be ready to walk should you arrive by bus! The food choices are huge good quality but like often before street food does not mean cheap in Seoul! We had some of their famous mung bean pancake' was ok but tasted better before' plus rice cake on slice sauce' same comment for that dish' the area was busy and the staff was a little short on temper at the first location! We moved on to sample the blood sausage and a spicy stew of offal meat both brilliant' one dines on small wooden benches out of plastic cups' we stopped with this the dumpling and noodle soup will have to wait until we return
52,5.0,"There were so many stalls to choose from, but honestly they all look about the same. We choose 2 stall that had some locals sitting down, and ordered quite a few dishes including blood sausage, narcotic gimbaps, japchae, bibimbip, and mandu.Everything was delicious except for the japchae (which was flavorless). Be sure to double-confirm what you order with the ladies manning the stall though, as we were half-forced to eat something we didn't order in the first place (apparently she asked us in Korean, and we had unknowingly agreed to). If you are a foodie visiting Seoul, Gwangjang Market is a must-visit!"
53,4.0,"One of our Korean friends took us Gwangjang Market. It was an interesting place to be =) You can try to eat live octopus, boiled bugs or just watch those who are eating them. There are so many souvenir shops.There are also plenty of cheap textile shops but quailty seemed poor to me. If you want to go where locals go, this is your place"
54,3.0,"Long for eating from food stalls but it was way too cold to eat in the market.  It is not a covered market and it was under minus 10 degrees.  Couldn't enjoy anything with masks, scarf and thick jackets on.  Only stayed for a while and left with some disappointment.  Be prepared if you com here during the winter."
55,5.0,"Great market, we went there to grab some food (kimbap/ bindaeteok etc.) and had a great time - you basically sit in front of the little stalls and eat and go. After that, we walked around and there were many stalls selling souvenirs (seaweed/ honey butter nuts/ ginseng extract) and bought a few things. The stall owners don't really speak English/ Chinese, but communication was alright. The price of honey butter nuts here was definitely cheaper than in Myeongdong"
56,4.0,"This place if absolutely a must see for food lovers. Enjoyed by locals and tourists, this place is always swarmed. We enjoyed kimbap, odeng, bibimbap, fresh made noodles, bindaetteok (at the center of the cross roads). Many locals were additionally queuing for hotteok, so we decided to get that too. Absolutely loved this place; research youtube for the best stands."
57,4.0,We went there during lunch time and we were surprised for a number of hawker food at there. You can try the famous live octopus here if want.
58,3.0,"This is a ""tourists"" market with tourists prices to match. You see mostly tourists eating at the many food stalls ( & buying at the shops). Food prices here in particular are indeed Expensive & taste not that great - although it is supposedly to be a local market. And the environment & stalls areas are not very clean/ hygienic. The food prices here are about the same or higher than those in the  various nicer shopping streets cafes/ food outlets. Considering this is a humble market setting & environment , prices are without doubt expensive.Come here for the experience if first time. We come here in every visit - not to patronise the expensive ""local market food stalls.""But to buy delicacies like fresh Kimchi & anchovies. Freshly made Kimchis are very different from those sold prepacked in supermarts.An elderly lady stall specialises in making this fresh Kimchi. A vacuum-pack of 1kg cost W10,000."
59,5.0,"We took subway to Gwangjang Market. We love this traditional market cos you can sit right in front of their stall enjoying foods, beer & atmosphere. Majority of their stalls selling same foods like pancake, live fresh octopus, blood sausage, Korea traditional fishcake & a lot more. They also have restaurants there too but I still prefer stalls in the middle of the walkway."
60,5.0,"It's a great bustling market and in a central alley has loads of places to try street foods. I'd been meaning to try Soondae (a kind of blood sausage with glass noodles in it and served with liver) and got my chance here. It was okay if you're into black pudding, which I am. Aside from that there is every other well-known street food on offer and it's a great place to get a feel for these. There's an excellent juice stall at the southern entrance which did an excellent kale, apple, banana, and pineapple smoothie too."
61,4.0,"We came to the market primarily for street food.  There are many food vendors selling similar things: mung bean pancake, rice cake, pork leg, octopus snack etc.  The place was very crowded and the space was quite tight.  A lot of the owner seem to be able to speak very little English and some Mandarin.  We just picked the stalks with most people, assuming that they were better.   Food was ok, and on the spicy and salty side.  Mung bean pancake was good.  It was greasy but we shared it among 4 people, so no big deal.  We also strolled along the alleys. Most of the stores sell textile, seafood, kimchi and some traditional Korean food.   In the middle of the market (not the food area), there were 2 people wearing the red uniform with an ""i"" bag.  They were the ""information center"".  They can answer any questions about the area.I don't see any public washroom there.  If you see the information dual, you cna ask them."
62,4.0,"Perfect for some late night food delicates, the usual market is open just till 8 pm, but the food stalls are open much longer..."
63,4.0,There's alot of food! And it is pretty delicious. Most of the stores there can speak chinese. The food portion are pretty big too. So it might be better if you go in a large group and order a variety of dishes. There's only 2 of us so we didn't manage to order alot as we are afraid that we couldn't finish it. Love the food. Would love to go there again.
64,5.0,"...and then nothing else! They're simply delicious but absolutely swimming in oil. If you're older than 20, don't try and eat one o your own. But just the plain pancake was excellent.Lovely place to wander round and look at traditional shops doing everything from metalwork, tailoring and selling fresh fish,."
65,3.0,"Gwangjang market is the real local food market you can find in Seoul, Heart of capital!.The market is clean and well organize. 70% of the owner is the elderly people that can prove enough how long this market run!Recommending : RAW Octopus, TOKBOKKI and else(many shop sells the same things)"
66,4.0,"A short walk from out hotel, we wandered around here for about an hour tasting and eating many different foods. A great place for the food!"
67,4.0,"Gwangjang Market is a short walk from Jongno-5 station. At night, it‚Äôs mainly the food stalls that are open. The market was really busy; many Seoulites out and about on a Saturday night. We were hoping to try the bindaetteok (mung bean pancakes), but the queues were incredibly long, so we selected a stall where we had tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes), mayak kimbap (Korean-style nori rolls) and japchae (vermicelli noodles). The lady running the stall was lovely and the food was delicious."
68,5.0,"We came here later in the evening for some dinner. It wasn't very busy, as I think the shops and stuff are mostly only open during the day, but the majority of the food stalls were still going pretty strong. We walked around the whole thing (didn't take too long) before we decided on a place. Keep in mind this isn't exactly the ""grab and go"" kind of street food. You can move around and try different things if you want, but in these types of markets I prefer to just find a place to sit down and enjoy myself for a bit. The stalls are generally more like little stationary outdoor kitchens (kinda all adjacent to each other) with benches in front for seating. Unfortunately my Korean is horrible so I don't remember the names of what we had, but we sat down at a stall and had some dumpling soup and a spicy cold noodle salad which we'd had at a couple different spots around Korea. The stall owner seemed super concerned about our ability to handle the spice level of the salad, but it was similar in spice level to to a pretty spicy kimchi, so it wasn't too bad for us. If you like to eat a lot of Thai or Indian food (and therefore probably have a tolerance for a bit of spice), you should look for it and try it because it's delicious. It basically is cold rice noodles served with a spicy sauce and a bunch of veggies. The dumplings were good too, it was a nice soup to have on a chilly night when you're sitting outside eating. A group of middle-aged Koreans came and sat next to us while we were eating, and one of the guys was really friendly and shared his shochu with us."
69,4.0,Locals come here for dinner and the food served here in the open stalls is catered to the local taste-buds. Definitely worth a try and the experience.
70,4.0,"This market has everything but the food alley towards the eastern end is the main draw card for visitors which is vibrant and full of colour. A wide variety of fish, vegetables and meat on offer mostly deep fried. We tried the pancakes which were delicious albeit a little oily.Easy walk to either DDP or Jongmyo.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."

72,4.0,"When I was there, It's about dinner time (5PM). Shops on the main street were closed, but the food streets were very crowed with tourists and residents who were having meal with their familiars. Bibimbab, Gimbab, variouse fried-pancakes and more like to serve for everyone even fresh seafood (OMG). Just visit there in the afternoon, you will find thing are interesting than my experience"
73,4.0,"Definitely worth a visit to this market even if you don't sew. Mainly sells fabrics, national costumes and great food.If staying in Seoul catch a taxi to the market, approx $8Aud."
74,5.0,We went there for an evening meal after doing the Stream.  The traditional mung bean cakes (Bindaetteock) are a must if you have tried them before.  We sampled other pancakes as well but did not match the valour of the Bindaetteock.  As other commenters have said there are arguments with some people but it would not be a market without this.Pick a spot that has good sit down area - you will appreciate it after a long day and packed with Korean local.  Be clear about what you want and there will be no problems.A kind thank you to the owner paves the way for next tourist.
75,4.0,"When I reached there about 4-5PM, almost shops were closed. so, I go directly to the food zone. Local food shops are available and so crowded."
76,4.0,"A long street of items, mostly food stalls, selling more or less the same items here and there. Pick a store of your liking and eat with the locals over there. Some stores are more popular as they may have feature in blogs before, thus you may have to wait for a short period of time. If not, you are choose the lesser crowded store for a simple meal in the local way."
77,5.0,"May not be the cheapest but for sure brings a local flavour. Game for local food? This would be the convenient place as many are found. The Mungbean cakes are probably the most favourite by the crowds, around 4k each which is a decent portion for 2-3 people. Morning is crowded, noon or just after lunch time is better if you asked me."
78,4.0,"This is a fun market to spend an hour or two. It's not so big, there's no real need for one of the tourist maps. There are not many tourists if you come here around 11am. At around 1pm it gets busier.The market has a bunch of different sections. Selling kitchenware, clothes, fabrics etc. Most of these didn't really catch our attention. Some stalls are selling quite good and fresh looking fish and other seafood. But we were staying at a Hotel...so no need for that. By far the most interesting part are the food lanes. Even though many stalls are selling the same stuff it's still a feast for your eyes. If you love offals/organs you'll find some treats here. But also the typical ""pancakes/omeletts"" made out of mashed beans (deep-fried) which taste great. And countless soups/hot-pots with a huge array of different veggies. Places and tables here are small and quite limited. Some stalls packed....some quite empty. I guess the locals know more than us tourists.There is actually a 2nd floor...but nobody seems to wander around there unless you came here for something specific. A fun little market, but actually you only need to see the food section.If you have limited time only in Seoul and you only can visit one market, I would choose the Namdaemun Market. Bigger, better, more fun, more food, more stuff!Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile."
79,4.0,"So much food to choose from. You can eat with the locals and it's cheap as well compared to other places. There is limited seating if you go during busy times. We mainly went to eat but saw the market stalls, and we did get lost but was so glad we found the food stalls."
80,3.0,The Gwangjang market is quite large. It's basically a + sign extended very far in each direction. If you try to enter the market area from near the train station you will encounter a hug textile market and get lost in the process. I can't even explain how to navigate your way out of it.The food is very repetitive. You'll see the same thing 20 times so if you see something you like just sit down and eat.It was decent but not great. The novelty for me was how crazy busy it was and how quickly the staff work.Heaps of seafood so if you don't eat seafood you will struggle.Grab a hotteok outside on the street stalls before you leave if you can find it. Hotteok is the best.
81,4.0,Gwangjang Market is a traditional wet market in Korea. It has many hawkers selling local food and stuffs. Many people will go there for their food. It's really fun to walk one round in the market to see how the local hawkers doing business and what interesting food they have. A good experience and interesting place to visit !!
82,4.0,"This is their local fish and food market. They have lots of food and a fun experience to try it out. They have small seating area around the table. Interesting. We tried the clam soup, it was good."
83,4.0,"We visited the market a couple of time to look around and purchased freshed fruits and vegies, dried seafoods, cloths and accessories. We didn't try any local foods as they are high in carbs. If you want to purchase Korean gifts and modern and traditional clothings items and cloths this place is highly recommended for variety and price."
84,4.0,"I enjoyed my 10 am breakfast of hot bowl noodle dumpling soup in this market. I bought a lot of almond yogurt for me to bring home. The price is cheaper than the groceries. I had the pancake, kimbob and preserved octopus being bought by kilograms. I spent well my pasalubong budget money here. I will visit Gwangjang Market again when I come back."
85,5.0,"This rather small market is a definite Seoul Must-go-to place. Try Korean dishes along with the locals, and don't be shy in your choice of food: you'll be rewarded with the appreciation of the local guests, the curiosity of the stand cooks and an incredible palette of unusual tastes.(My favs were the seafood booths). The local pork rice sausage was also delicious."
86,5.0,"Huuuuuuge. Well laid out with different sections for different products. The street food area was absolutely brilliant - very difficult to choose an option. Good for souvenirs, fish, groceries. Oh and traditional Hanbok costume."
87,5.0,"I was brought here by my Korean friend. The place was full of stalls selling korean daily food, and was busy serving mostly locals. They are open as a market during the day and turned into sort of like a food junction at night. Very interesting."
88,5.0,"This is a market where you find lot of local food and shopping options. You would not be able to find fashionable clothes but if you are shopping for your elderly folk at home, there's lots of options. Local food like mung bean pancake, live octopus, and blood sausage can also be found here. Some of the ajummas selling them can speak Chinese too. A must visit."
89,5.0,"This market is by far the best one i have visited because of the people i met (shop owner). The one i like best is Mr Na Derk Yum (sorry did  not get his shop name) a souvenir shop owner. He loves Abba and play their song always. He is a very funny guy, he dance the 70's moves for us and he know who is Joseph Schooling. (know where i am from, right?) He also gives discount and free gift."
90,5.0,"I hit this place up everytime I visit Seoul. Most, if not all, of the food is delicious and affordable. My favourites would be the mayak kimball and mungbean pancakes. Some places even offer english menus, but pointing and gesturing works for ordering as well! Eating in a bustling market definitely adds to the experience, definitely not one you'll get from a typical restaurant."
91,4.0,"Get your eyes full and stomach full of Korean food craving fulfilled here. Experience the madness of a traditional market with colorful kimchi, food wares and cheap stuff."
92,5.0,"This is a great place to add to the itinerary during your stay in Seoul. It was very busy and a bit chaotic but a sign of a very good place when it comes to eating there. The food on offer was impeccable. We had the chance to try 'raw octopus' for 15,000 Won. Be prepared for crowds but well worth it"
93,5.0,"I've had foreign friends visit this place multiple times and they have told me that nothing beat this experience. Especially the food here is very authentic as it is humble and can be a quite unique dining experience. It tends to get crowded and even for a person who hates being in crowded places can enjoy this place as it is a unique scene to see hundreds eat and drink during late nights. I recommend that no one neglects this special gem, it is truly a Korean dining and cultural attraction that will give you the first foot into this city. My personal recommendation is:Eating Nok Do Pancakes and Soju and Makguli at SooENae, which is located in the center of the market."
94,5.0,"Great place to try street style korean food. Many options, some are delicious. Cultural. Worth visiting at night time."
95,3.0,Majority of the food stores sells the same food. So there's not much variety of food to choose. Not that fantastic for me as the stores are half opened when i was there during lunch time. Would go back only when i don't have other place to go.
96,5.0,"We came here twice in our visit just because the food is really good, although it does get busy and a little noisy."
97,4.0,Went there to see local food and look around and ate a delicious dumpling soup with Kimchi with locals at stand #3 where they spoke enough english to help me and teach me how to eat things properly!
98,3.0,"Interesting to visit but don't bother eating here. 99% of people eating there are tourists with about 95% tourists from PRC. We tried one stall and had fish cake in soup (KW3000) , pig intestines (KW10,000), rice cake in spicy sauce (KW2000),  fried glass noodle (KW3000) and one bowl of rice. We were charged KW22.000. We couldn't figure out how it came to KW22,000. Did the bowl of rice cost KW4000!? We could have eaten better food in a proper restaurant for the same price. Definitely not worth the money for street food."
99,4.0,This is a really good place to have your meal and taste local food. Some of the recommended food to try here are the pancakes and the dumpling which is located almost end of the street. This is also a good place to purchase food products and local tidbits.
100,4.0,"Got off at the wrong subway station but that's how fun adventures come about. We hit the almost empty market at around 10pm and followed the laughter and shouting and came across a whole range of stalls selling food (the happy sounds were from Koreans drinking soju, the national drink - gotta say, the Koreans do like a drink!). I tried food that I hadn't even hear of before: sea pineapple (an edible sea squirt - believe me, its more of a squirt than a pineapple; think slippery and slimy, and looking like an ugly squat alien cucumber, served as sashimi; only for the brave), sundae (made by boiling or steaming cow or pig's intestines that are stuffed with rice), tteokbokki: thick dumplings in a spicy sauce; boiled big heart, spongy and tart. And off we went into the night."
101,3.0,"In the three-month summer holiday vacation, I travelled to Seoul, which is the capital of Korea. Korea is a country that gathers different kinds of snacks and food. This time my friend takes me to a traditional market of Korea which called Gwangjang Market. We go there by subway. Gwangjang Market is a local market for people to seek the delicious and na√Øve food. Actually, we know this place through a very famous television programme called Running Man. The television programme also visits the market before. As we all know, most of the Korean food are spicy. There are all kinds of traditional snacks in the market for you to have a try, like rice cake, breaded fish stick, fried chicken and so on. The most unforgettable food for me is eating the raw octopus, the feeling is really special. I advise the tourists can take it as a lunch or supper as there are many choices to choose."
102,4.0,"We came to Korea from tropical Saipan in December, inconveniently lacking winter clothes. Hit up the secondhand market area and got ourselves some warm, funky clothes on the cheap, followed up with a great little lunch. Much better prices here than in the more touristy areas."
103,3.0,"We came here via metro line 1 (Jongno 5-ga station) and walked a short while to the market. So it is quite accessible. Its southern side is flanked by the Cheongyecheon river, so a nice place for a walk after eating & exploring in the market.It is a very busy place.There is a wet and dry section of the market. The ""dry"" side retailed all manner of daily necessities such as textiles, apparel, shoes etc. The wet side has a stretch of hawkers selling seafood, vegetables etc.Probably the highlight is the food section where there are many many cart stalls set in the middle of the alley ways. There are seating places in front of these stalls. Most, if not all of the visitors eating there seemed to be tourists!"
104,5.0,"2nd visit here. It is a mixed of wet market with other stuffs.  You can get clothes, blankets, daily essential, fruits & vegetables, and lots of seafood here.What make it famous is the street food in the market. You can just sit down at the stalls & enjoy the freshly prepare food. As vegetarian, there choices are quite limited. But I like the Original Gwangjang toast by the old grandma at the end of the market & the red bean cake near the middle cross junction inside the market.But my main purpose to be here is for the raw Korean Ginseng & the dried seaweed. We also bought a set of Korean cutlery, dried persimmon, nuts & snacks.  We ended up with so much stuffs (enough to fill in 2 XL sized Longchamp bag) that we have to go back straight to our hotel:)"
105,4.0,"This is a traditional market selling food and daily necessaries. Many kinds of Korean eateries, and the portion is big. Worth a visit!"
106,5.0,"1. Definitely Not a tourist market. It is the oldest market in Seoul and famous for fabrics and traditional clothing.2. Best visited for the food, though YMMV. 4 food lanes, converging together in the middle in the shape of a cross. Mostly locals, with the occasional camera toting tourist gawking.3. Open late for food, 'till midnight anyhow. Yet, this late sees only 1/4 or less food vendors open, although virtually every type of food served here, with one or two exceptions, will be found this late. 4. You can search youtube for videos of the market, showing which specific foods are available. Lots of choices, but no restaurants with menus. 5. Stopping by at lunch or dinnertime is great, the entire place is packed with locals eating and makes for a lively scene. 6. Be adventurous. Try things outside of your comfort zone.7. Clean, sanitary environment, so don't worry about your belly.8. Seating is by bench, ordering is as simple as pointing. Simple as that!9. Best approach- walk all the isles, 4 with two lanes each so 8 rows really. Scope it all out, then pick two or three places to sit down and eat at. Order lots of variety, sample and share!"
107,4.0,"Yes, there are lots of tourists here, but there are also many locals who come to eat. There is a great selection of food to try at very affordable prices, our favourite were the mung bean pancakes! There is a metro exit next door to the market so it is easy to get to via public transport. Alternatively take a stroll down the canal which runs alongside the market."
108,5.0,"This pretty crowded market sell all kinds of korean street food, and snacks. Lots of stall selling fresh mung bean pancake with soju here, and a whole lot of other stuffs such as soft shell crabs, deboned chicken feed, blood sausage, etc.You can also get the live octopus here, if you don't feel like going all the way to Noryangjin fish market for it.We went around 5 pm on a holiday and it was very crowded, I heard from our food tour guide that in the morning there are less people and alot less crowded."
109,4.0,"Gwangjang markes is huge and contains both food stalls, grocery shops, clothing and garment shops, kitchenware shops and more.It is a well spent time just to walk around. And if you are hungry it is a great place to try some local cuisines. Korean dumplings, mungbean pancakes and hand-chopped noodles are just a few of them."
110,3.0,Food stalls and hawkers are everywhere. You can find  the traditional Korean food here. A bit messy and dirty.
111,5.0,"I have been to many street food locations globally; none is comparable to the size, variety and hustle and bustle of Gwangjang Market.  The unique cover at this market is high enough for air ventilation, shelter the hawkers and patrons alike from heat in the summer, rain, wind and certainly snow in the winter.  The method of cooking maybe different from one stall to the next, you will find the same sort of orange color gochujang used for almost every item on displace from every hawker, they tried to pull everyone to their stall, just like the San Gennaro feast Little Italy in New York, the food is delicious just like the spicy crabs on Temple Street in Hong Kong, and the variety, just like Jiufen in Taiwan.  Certain food items maybe offensive to some Westerners, I have even tried my first live octopus there.  Barbaric but once in your life time ‚Ä¶.  Gwangjang Market is designed as a tourist destination, but worth your time for a visit, a good experience"
112,5.0,"Be prepared to be astounded but if one wants authentic local food that caters to the locals, this is it. The best kimbap and fishcake soup I ever had from an old lady who works by herself, perfect with a side of cold soju."
113,4.0,"Covered market ,great when it rains. Everything from bedding to clothes. Fresh meats,fish ,and vegetables for sale. There is also great street food that delights the palate."
114,4.0,Great place to buy typical korean things or just to eat typical food. Do not be surprised by the number of people it is very very crowded but it is part of its charm.
115,3.0,"What I enjoyed: The experience of visiting and walking around a traditional Korean market, you will see lines of stalls with their food laid out/being cooked in front of you, and you can choose which stall(s) you fancy, take a seat at their benches/slim tables and eat. If you don't know Korean it's fine, pointing at the food to order would work as well, some of the stall owners can speak a little English/Chinese. What I didn't enjoy that much: Was quite crowded when I visited. The food was average only, not the best I've had in other markets/other parts of Seoul."
116,3.0,"This place has a variety of street food,  however you can get this kind of food around Seoul from restaurants or street vendors.  Its not worth the long visit and going out of your way to find it.  And even though it's old,  it's more dirty than charming. Worth skipping,  do if you  have extra hours to kill only."
117,4.0,"Hmmm this was a unique market filled with food stalls. This market is mostly visited by people in their 50's and older. The vendors sell food that most young Koreans don't eat. You can find ""typical Korean food"" like kimbap and jabchae but the market specializes in the unusual Korean food you see on American travel shows. Only recommended for the brave and curious."
118,4.0,This market is worth searching for if you want to eat cheap street food in bulk! The food wasn't the greatest we had in Seoul but we enjoyed the experience of sitting with locals at their tiny little food stalls and watching them make buckwheat noodles while we slurped our freshly made dumpling soup. So good to just sit around eating and people-watching! Afterwards we just roamed around the market trying different snack-foods. Very satisfying! I would highly recommend this market for a fun lunch experience!
119,4.0,"This is the place if you want to eat street food but the portion here is big. We just try 2 stalls here. There are kimbap, dumpling, noodle soup, raw meat, etc. the price is around 5000won per food."
120,5.0,It is never usual for me to see pig head at market place. It seems very normal for Korean to have fun with it. Unique experience. Great location.
121,5.0,"Knew this satll from Paik's show and do not even have the address to find it. BUt we happen to found it using our 6th sense. Just follow the path way where people sell cloth and fabric... if not, try and eat whatever you want in this market. The choices are various."
122,4.0,Great food market nestled in the boughs of the market. Food really comes more to life. Easy enough to get to this place it's along the subway. Coming over from the other side of the city is easy too either subway or bus. Little bit of walking but easy enough to make it there. Once your there head out to surrounding stores there are lots of places with energy.
123,5.0,"Toooooo many things to try out here, our tummies weren't big enough to fit them all. We tried the kimbap, rice cakes and jokbal, served with some fish cake soup on the side. So yummy! Also had a serve of bibim naengmyeon (spicy cold noodles), our first time trying this and we fell in love with this dish immediately. We will be back soon for the bindaetteok (mung bean pancake), boribap (mixed rice) and yukhoe (seasoned raw beef)!"
124,4.0,"Go there see real traditional market place, real local street food and maybe cheaper souvenirs. Its deserves a visit if you have time. Know that market is big so go to fabrics and food sectios"
125,5.0,"Many interesting sights, including food, textiles and kitchen ware. The main alley may be very touristy but walk a bit further in and venture, and you will find pockets of quiet eateries in this market. I like walking towards the textile sections to see Korean culture at its best without the touristy jazz."
126,4.0,"it's a massive Market sells lots of stuff, food is the most. the variety, taste, the colour, the ppl, you have to try it all. i only had few and was already full. dare to try the fresh octopus, if u like sashimi, then i bet u will like it."
127,5.0,"The place to go for some amazing street-style food.Highly recommended: The mung bean pancaked. Sit yourself down at one of the tables in the center of the market. In no time you'll have one of the deep fried beauties in front of you. Best eaten with the vinegar and onion sauce for dipping and a delicious bowl of makgeolli, the korean rice wine! WARNING: The wine is quite sweet and masks the alcohol quite well, so pace yourself when drinking."
128,4.0,"I want there in the last few months and saw many chinese people on that street which was kind of noisy. The stuff they sold there was interesting but remember to bargain with the shop, you will get some surprise"
129,5.0,This is a very huge and famous day market of Seoul. You can get souvenirs here too. We love the food here.
130,3.0,This is more a stop for Korean bites than shopping.  Try out the local snacks like the Korean Spicy Rice Cake which is a common fare in almost every stall. Casual sitting here so dress light in Summer.  There are still plenty of shops selling your daily wares and sometimes Korean souvenirs.
131,5.0,"This place is huge!!! And so clean to be a street market that it is not even real!. I have been in places like that in mainland China and there is nothing to compare, on that (and many others) regard.This is a world in itself, self contained, I would say it comprised many blocks, everything that you want to see is there. I find it reasonably priced, a magic universe of food, ingredients, sewing notions (amazing, it is the sewer paradise), electronics, people offering any kind of services, even the ones that are not longer offered in the west. We have seen a guy squatting on the floor repairing an old iron, for example. It is also Fabric Wonderland, every type of fabric is offered there, plus very good clothing, very well priced. Everybody is friendly and no one hassles you, type of Chinese style. A great place, totally worthy."
132,4.0,"I live in China and I‚Äôm barely getting used to being able to stomach the foods there. I told my father in law I wanted to go to a very cultural market and eat and sample as many things as I could and not go broke. He said ok and he didn‚Äôt even have to think twice. We had already been to Myeongdong but then that is very touristy (still fun but the food catered to tourist flavors) and I wanted a place where locals ate. He brought us to Gwangjang Market. The place is alive and food is everywhere. It‚Äôs everything I wanted to sample. However, you can‚Äôt be squeamish and you have to just sample it. I didn‚Äôt like many things. In fact, I didn‚Äôt like more than half of the things I sampled but I did sample some foods that I really liked. My stomach wasn‚Äôt feeling too good after our trip lol but I did it, I live once, and I want to try it all. Come here and sample away courageously."
133,5.0,"On our last day in Seoul, we decided to visit Gwangjang Market and we were sorry we had to rush to catch our plane.  There are so many stalls of interesting plates and bowls of food there.  We tried the juk first.  The seafood bowl was delicious especially with the kimchi mixed in.  We also had the sweeter version which seemed like it was mixed in with either mung bean or corn.  Next we moved on to the dumplings, rice cakes & soup.  Yum!!!  The kimchi dumpling was a different flavor we had never had before.  We loved it and the other dumplings.  The rice cakes were good, but we somewhat regretted not getting the fresh noodles.Then onto the daikkon rolls!  These were freshly hand made.  We had a bunch for 2500 won.  Such a great deal!Finally we had to try the mung bean pancakes.  We liked the pork filled better. They had more flavor.  But the regular pancakes were delicious with a little sauce.We wanted to try the sweet version or some dessert, but did not have the time.  What a great meal to finish our trip!"
134,4.0,"A great place for a wander even if you're not looking for anything in particular. There are loads of fabric stalls, and the food street is great. I love the potato cakes and they are really cheap. There is a huge vintage clothing area upstairs with plenty of choice and sizes. I got some great bargains!"
135,4.0,"You will find this kind of market is everywhere in Seoul. But Gwangjang Market is worth to go as here is one-stop marketplace for everything you can put into your mouth. From the wetmarket, you can buy the seafood and have the restaurant there to cook for you. There are plenty of food stalls selling all kind of Korean delicacies, from ginseng soup to kimchi dumplings, korean pancake, bibimbab, and even the rice barley drinks. I give a 10/10 for this spot from the assessment of one who craves for foods in Seoul. The prices are also very  competitive!"
136,4.0,"We came to this place as we were looking for fresh gingseng, I was not expect that  we will find food vendor selling different variety of food, dumpling, noodle, pancake. We tried kimchi dumpling taste was really good and fresh noodle soup with good price. worth a visit."
137,4.0,"We went to the market to see more about traditional Korean food and I was confused a bit because they have so many stalls selling the same food at one of each alley. Too many vendors to be chosen and those ahjumas will keep calling you to eat at their place. This is one of the problem I see in South Korea that they really compete to each other with the same stuffs just to see which stall more popular by the crowd. We eat the traditional Bimbimbap, tteokbokki, hand cut noodles and dumpling and it was pretty good. They rarely speak English but they speak Chinese due to the growing of Chinese tourists to South Korea but most of them have English menu so you can just ask to see the price before you eat at their stall. The price range on every stall pretty much the same and eating at the market doesn't mean cheap price (KRW 5000-10,000) depends on what you eat. Anyway it always a good experience to see a traditional market in every country to feel more about the culture and their food and I feel that Korea has the best street food so far."
138,4.0,A great place to visit for some souvenir items and various sized other shopping. Located right near the subway making it easy to dive into and out of shopping. Just give yourself some time to check around at pricing as the same things may be slightly cheaper 1min later in the markets.
139,3.0,"Despite having been to Seoul several times, I've never ventured beyond the Namdaemun traditional market. This place is not hard to find and it's pretty clean and sheltered. The most famous item in this market has to be the bintaettok (mung bean pancakes). Many people raved about them but I frankly did not enjoy them that much. It's an acquired taste, I think. There are many food stalls to sample local food and you can even buy banchan (small side dishes) back to your hotel to slowly savour them. I didn't see much for shopping though there are so many shops selling pretty hanboks. I'm glad I came for the experience but I'm not sure if I will be back a second time."
140,4.0,"A great place to buy souvenirs and taste local food. You'll see it will get crowded once local people have done working and eat at those local food vendors. Recommend to stop by at one of those food vendors. There's a roof over the market, so rain won't spoil the mood."
141,5.0,"Easy to go there and lots of delicious foods and traditional foods, you must go there for try it. And have too many stalls on the market."
142,4.0,"Stayed in Seoul for a few days, and found this market so satisfying for healthy, cheap dinners. Our favourite was the handmade noodle stand near to one of the entrances - so fresh!! And the salad/rice bowls were at other stalls near by were also very nice. Meals worked out to be about $5 Aud from memory and were sooo filling....always finished off our night at the markets with a donut mmm!"
143,4.0,"a lot of food variety, must come and try. also selling many other stuff but we did not look into as we can't speak korean"
144,5.0,A great selection of foods here. Make sure to try their mung bean pancake and also the bibimbap. Price wise is reasonable
145,5.0,great to experience a bit of the real seoul.Very busy market where locals and visitors meet.Gets crazy for lunchtime as there are many korean food stalls that are bustling wit customers
146,4.0,"This is the place to feast the local foods with the locals sitting on long bench around the stall holder. It is very crowded around meal times. Apart from the different kinds of local food stalls, you can also find deliciously tasty appetisers - different kind of kimchi, seasoned seafood, etc. Vacuumed pack products price ranges from 5,000-15,000 KRW. I bought a box of seasoned octopus tentacles for 15,000KRW. It was so tasty. I regretted not buying more including the kimchi. Those sold at the supermart are more expensive and certainly not as fresh or tasty. Beyond the food street are stalls selling clothings, bed sheets, cushion covers, pot & pans, souvenirs, etc. From there, you can take a slow 15 minutes walk to Dongdaemun.I will be back again to buy more of these appetisers."
147,4.0,"We went for the food reviews online. It was Sunday and a lot of the shops were closed, but the food was definitely an adventure. It was very crowded, and if you have picky eaters they will not enjoy this!"
148,4.0,"The food market is a must do. The layout is like an octopus with little streets extending out of a centre point all under one roof. It feels like each little street specializes in certain kinds of food, too many to mention, look out for the suggestions in the various Seoul must eat lists online."
149,5.0,"My wife and I had seen a video walk-through of this market on YouTube (thanks, Cory May) and really wanted to experience it since it looked so crazy and seemed to go on forever.  Boy, we weren't disappointed.  It's a covered shopping mall (though nearly as cold inside as out) with intersecting spokes that make it a maze to negotiate.  Entering from the south, by Cheonggyecheon Stream, you'll encounter the food stalls situated in the middle of the mall walkway.  You walk on either side of the food stalls (which have  limited sit-down) dining.  But, watch out for the ever-present motor scooter delivery guys who drive up and down the same walking areas.  If you can imagine a scooter driving up and down the aisles in a department store, it's kind of like that.  The assortment of food that is available is pretty amazing, and the odors are of a hundred restaurants exhausting their kitchens into one area (but not overpowering or suffocating, just a mishmash of smells).  Off to either side of the walkways are the vendors, everything you can imagine from fish to bolts of cloth.  You almost cannot take it all in there are so many colors and so much stuff jammed into these corridors.  Then there are the side corridors where there's no food but more stuff piled high in the middle of the walking area where the food stalls were in another corridor.  My wife went into this place saying she was going to buy nothing, nothing.  I had to go out to a money changer before we got halfway through our visit.  You have to see this place to understand it.  That's my best description."
150,3.0,"This place near Dongdaemun area, which is many grocery for stationery, fashion, shoes, etc. I take lunch here for some Korean ""snack"" but it is quite cheap and make me full. But many others stall selling foods like noodle seafood, etc"
151,4.0,"This market is just lovely it's so very bright and beautiful, and there is quite a variety of souvenirs to look through. I recommend visiting!"
152,5.0,We got recommendations at our hotel written so the locals would understand what we were looking for.  Everyone helped us find the 2 places we wanted to eat at the customers inside by pointing showed us what to eat because only a little of the menu was in English
153,5.0,We tried the fried green bean cake as well as raw beef with egg yolk. Both of them are extremely delicious. Packaged kimchi and other preserved food could also be found there and sealed packaging is available upon request in some stores.
154,4.0,Visit this place at night to taste the local famous bindaetteok (Pan cake made of mung beans) and Makgeolli (Fermented rice wine) few more exotic food options!
155,4.0,"The market is in a big building, but there is no heating. I was there on a cold day, and it was still cold, but not as much as outside. The area is huge. You can see live octopuses in aquariums, fried silkworms, various kinds of seaweed, a lot of stuff you won't find in the West. Of course you can also try everything.There are different parts of the market, and food is only one of them (the most interesting IMHO). Another one is e.g. textiles, where you can buy clothes, linen etc."
156,5.0,"We came here twice during our 5 day trip to Seoul and loved it. The atmosphere is great ! It's always super busy and you can barely move but it just adds to the experience. I recommend come on an empty stomach and try lots from the different stalls. We tried the bindaetteok (fried mung bean pancake), ddeokbokki, kimbap, kimchi mandu and a selection of jeon. Everything was great, but I would mention that if you're not a huge meat eater, the smell of the blood sausage and pig trotters can be very strong. Highly recommend to come here, especially if you're on a budget."
157,5.0,Came across a few friendly seller & love the foods there. Very near to subway station. It's a local morning market with all kind of foods
158,4.0,Loved experiencing the food and people at this market.  Be a local and try the food at one of the stalls.  We indulged in some scallion pancakes and ddukbokgi (spicy rice cake).  Many of the bigger spots also have English menus!
159,4.0,"Lots of hot food, great for a cold day, just sit down on a warm bench seat and tell them what you want. This market is used a lot by locals and has fresh produce such as Meats Fish Fruit and Vegetables as well as clothing and fabrics"
160,5.0,"Its a good idea to visit this place early in the morning. Then you can see and experience the locals shopping for groceries and having breakfast. There are loads of stores selling vegetables, meat, seafood and of course, kimchi. Also there were stores selling clothing, textiles, housewares, etc.We ate the pancakes and also tried a dumpling noodles soup for breakfast. It was decent and filling."
161,4.0,"We went there around 11am and were stucked by the continuous people flow.  Tried with patience to follow the flow to see all the food stalls inside the markets.  All the traditional Korean food such as green bean cakes, cakes with pork, knife slicing noodles, dumpling, seafood, sausages and pigs knuckles are available at good price.  Again, eat and go.  Don't expect comfortable environment.  Apart from food, the shops on 2 sides of the walkway are selling dried seafood and other local household items. A good local feel and experience."
162,4.0,"This market is near to Jongno 5-ga station and Euljjiro 4-ga station. The place is for locals so it becomes noisy after 9+am. We headed to the food sections for breakfast. We sat down on the bench and tried the bindaettok (pancake), just like the locals would."
163,4.0,"The market is popular for the locals coz there are many food stalls selling local Korean food including dumplings, fried fishes, deep fried pancake, Korean sausages, seafood etc. at reasonable prices.  The market is very lively at night and crowds gathered there for food and drink.  There are also fresh food stores as well as groceries.  Suitable for people looking for local Korean taste."
164,3.0,"We arrived at Gwangjang Market late evening; our main purpose is to try some of the popular local food (bibimbap, pancake, gimbak, etc).  The place was crowded with diners sitting in front of the many stalls. Some of the popular stalls had long queues, probably the food taste better. We did not have much time therefore we scout around for those stalls that we are comfortable.  The pancake and gimbak was ok and reasonable priced.I would recommend this place only to food lovers who like to explore the locals way of life and try the varieties of local food. You will also need to close an eye on the hygiene here, which is not of the highest standard."
165,2.0,"I would urge all the tourists to pay close attention to the prices they are charging in the markets. I have attached a photo of the store I went to  and they charged me 2-3 times as much for dinner in comparison to someone who is a local. I went to this store because  of a lot of locals to begin with, besides the food seem interesting. Also, there was another food stand that charged me 3,000 KRW for rice wine that should be about 1,500 KRW. Overall you can get good food in the market, however please be aware of the prices beforehand."
166,4.0,"Personally I am not too interested in all of the fabrics and hanboks that are for sale here but once I reached the food alley I was in heaven! Never experienced anything like this - old Korean ladies in their small stalls cooking ddeokbokki, jeon etc, always having about 4 sitting spaces crammed around their little 'station'... we went for a jeon selection and it was a great experience!"
167,4.0,"This is a very big indoor market with many, many stalls selling the same or very similar items. We sampled some interesting and delicious seafood."
168,4.0,"For me, it was a very enjoying experience to be in this market, eating local dishes from different establishments, smelled that fresh seafood and see some souvenir shops here. Beautiful Korean dresses are a must to see. Totally recommended if you visit Seoul."
169,4.0,"Going here: take Line 1 to Jongno 5-ga station then take exit 7.Everything is here. From food, accessories, clothes, souvenirs and etc.We tried a lot of korean street food from spicy rice cake, fried squid, fish cake, blood sausage to mung bean pancake for very cheap price. Highly recommended for Korean market experience."
170,2.0,"we had lot food here.mostly were pleasant experience.but normally they expected customer to order more.went there mainly because we want to try mug bean Pancake,but they kinda like force us take a set of everything.that time i were really full and my friend cant help me finish it.we decided too choose own pancake variety,but the vendor ask us take away,not allow to eat there.some are very nice,they even feed us with foodüòä"
171,5.0,"I took my husband here during our recent trip to Seoul.  As a foodie, he really loved and appreciated this market.  It was a great way to show him the various Korean dishes but in an environment with tons of energy.  The food was inexpensive which allowed us try to various dishes.  Also, the vendors were all very friendly and welcoming especially to my husband who is an American.  Finally, it's great that this market is covered so a rainy day won't keep you away.  I would definitely recommend stopping by here for lunch and walk around to check out the various food stands!"
172,5.0,Lots of food stall selling similar food.Therefore you have a lot of choice which stall you want to eat from.If you want to get hanbok it's available as well. There are also some marinated stuff which provided free tasting
173,5.0,"If your into fabrics you'll love it! If your a street food fan you'll love it. It's a old time traditional market so it spoke to me in a profound level. It is warm, charming and ever so alive. I didn't encounter tourist hoard so if the local is your thing you'll love it. It's where the local elderly go to shop. Where if your staying for longer than a week Seoul, you can get hanbok made for cheap. It's an easy walk to Dongdaemun as well."
174,5.0,"LOVED the markets in Seoul, which operate nearly 24 hours a day and are equally busy at all hours.  We spent much of our time in the food area, observing and eating.  Took some courage, but on a recommendation we ate and loved the mung bean pancakes being fried fresh at many stalls, and drank local beer along with the super hot cakes.  Ate fresh dates and explored the many stalls selling everything from traditionally embroidered clothing to sundries and souvenirs.  This is clearly a place the locals use.We were super impressed by how friendly and open people were.  They were very happy to share their country (and their table) with foreigners and seemed amused by our photo taking and deer in the headlights look!"
175,5.0,"Amazing shopping, so many stalls of everything. Good souvenir place. Eat dumpling soup next to all the locals in between the stalls of clothes etc. It was a huge, giant, bowl of noodle and dumpling soup for 5000w. Noodles are made right in front of you! Delicious, extremely authentic experience."
176,4.0,Many wonderful smells surrounding the food booths. Too bad we just had lunch. The streets were packed and everyone enjoyed their fast and inexpensive food.
177,5.0,This market was suggested by our hotel reception desk as we wanted to see some traditional shopping‚Ä¶ this place is good for people who are looking to shop in bulk for business‚Ä¶ mind blowing variety and stuff‚Ä¶ you also tantalize your taste buds with local delicacy.If you have time do visit!
178,4.0,"Table after table after table of people sitting around big woks of cooking, some recognizable some not, food. Food being dished out and money being exchanged depending on the dish served. Seas of people coming and going. All very interesting and entertaining. At the other end are clothing shops. This is different than other markets. Authentic. Go!"
179,3.0,Visited this market at night time. Plenty of foods and  with mostly all the same food on most stalls. There are quite a few shops selling dried seaweed snacks and price can bargain....
180,5.0,"This market is so big, it could take a whole day to see everything.  There's clothing, beautiful local Korean apparel for children and adults, shoes, fabric,etc. and best of all, FOOD!  This is were you can taste everything Korean, from dumplings, seafood, noodles, all kinds of Korean delicacies. There are stalls with stools where you can sit and order whatever food the stall is selling.  Lots of locals and tourists come here to shop and eat.  This place is a ""must see""."
181,5.0,OMG be prepared.....This market is unbelievable we stopped by several stalls to experience the local eats..DELICIOUS!!.. Be prepared for crowds and heat and take in the local vibe.  A must see.
182,3.0,"lots of local foods, tradition souvenir shop.most famous market in seoul, must visit place.food is awesome."
183,4.0,"It is a wholesale market where one can buy fabrics, hanboks, beddings, shoes, bags and dried food. Do visit the Eatery Alley where one can savor generous portions of reasonably priced street foods like jeon ( pancake) , yangnyeom chicken, kall-guksu ( noodle soup), bulgogi ( grilled beef slices), bibimbap ( mixed rice of vegetables, stir fried beef and egg) ."
184,5.0,"Our host recommended this as a traditional Korean market and I am glad we took her advice. So much food, we wanted to try everything. The pork chops and the fried veggies were the best. Also very cheap."
185,4.0,The food section of the market is extensive - and very interesting. Just go around and try what you like
186,1.0,"I might be biased while doing this review, but I got robbed here. My bag was stolen with IDs, creditcards, mobile phone, glasses, etc. It was late around 9-10 pm. there were nor many people around, however some few stalls were open. We had dinner there, and it was a nice atmosphere and food. Everything seemed to be friendly until the bag disappeared . I put the bag just next to me, in a moment I turned over  to talk to someone sitting on the opposite side my bag was stolen . We managed to see the guy run after but with no success.  We believe he we  watched for some time before he decided to robbed me  . It was my fault, i should have been more careful, and keep it tight on my body but I had the impression it was a safe country and a safe place. However, it doesn't seem to be the case.  If you go there take a lot care of your belonging , especially if you eat and drink soju. It was a bad experience for me, spent hours at the police station (till 3 am)  who could not understand well English.  I regret a lot having gone there. I wish I wouldn't. Instead I would have gone to another market."
187,4.0,"It‚Äôs an indoor market.  We went on a Sunday and some shops are closed so we headed straight to the food court.  The food section were huge and busy with tons of tourists. There were many vendors selling the same food so walk around before you decide to sit down.  We had many quick stops - Korean fried chicken, bibibap, fried green beans cake, fried pork cake, grilled red bean cake, bamboo-like juice, fried donut‚Ä¶etc‚Ä¶  If you dare to try, vendors are selling live octopus (not sashimi, they eat them live).  We also found a store near the food court selling cheaper ginseng tea and candies (with bargain of course)."
188,3.0,"This market is very good for vegetables and other edibles.  It is mainly a clothing market and has little to attract tourists from a souvenir perspective, but the cooked food area has a lot of pancakes and fried goodies, along with lots of meat and seafood.  Definitely a good choice for cheap eats."
189,4.0,"Lots of food and clothes vendors. Interesting to see the different foods that are being sold. I love the onion pancakes. Shoes , clothes umbrellas are all very cheap. Just walk around and sample the local food/drinks. If you enjoy bargaining then you will get a chance to brush up your skills when buying non food items"
190,5.0,"This is a great traditional busy market and well worth visiting if you want to see some of the more interesting Korean style foods. Some parts of the market are more specialised for food stuffs, while other parts focus on clothing (with an extensive Hanbok and linen market on the first floor above the market). I would recommend trying the Bindaetteok (Mung bean pancake) as well as Yakgwa (small honey cakes). A great place to experience some Korean culture."
191,5.0,"We came here because we had an overnight stopover in Seoul and were hungry at midnight.  We didnt really expect much in terms of quality of food but I have to mention that this place is where I tasted the best bim bim bap ever.  Period.  I love Korean food and eat it frequently so it only made sense that the best bim bim bap you can ever have is in Seoul.  Take the trip, its worth it.  There are many stalls and food carts and I can' tell you which one is better than the others.  All I can say is when we went there and ventured to eat, it was something that I did not regret and wish that I could back frequently just to have bim bim bap again."
192,4.0,"If you arrive late in Seoul, you can make a trip to this market for food. Many stalls selling the same kind of food, so it makes no difference. There are plenty of shops too, but I reckon they only open late at night."
193,5.0,"I would put Gwangjang Market in the top 5 must do places when visiting Seoul.  There is a myriad of traditional food options in the market and almost all of them are extremely delicious.  Whenever someone from home comes to visit me in Seoul, I always make sure they spend at least one meal at Gwangjang Market.  Whether it is bindaeduk, ddeokbokki, mondu, kimbap, noodles, or whatever, you will be sure to find it here.  Besides food, there are plenty of other shops for you to enjoy.  Just go check it out.  It's one of the best places in Seoul!"
194,5.0,If you want to eat something authentic than you should try this market. Everything is fresh and prepared in front of you. With one or two bottles of rice wine ( Makgeolli) and a seafood Bindaetteok you start and after that you change to a different booth. There are sure 100 places where you can sit down and enjoy their cooking. And it's not expensive at all.
195,5.0,Gwangjang Market was bustling with great Korean food stalls.  The kimchi dumplings are great as are the mung bean pancakes.
196,5.0,"This is a must see for the authentic markets and culture of Seoul. You don't have to eat anything (I would and did), but you must go see the food vendors selling bindaeduk (mung bean pancakes - delicious), wang sundae (large sized blood sausage), fresh seafood, pumpkin and red bean porridge, mini-rice rolls, and pan fried pork skin. Besides all of this, there is a large section selling traditional Korean hanboks (dresses) that must be seen to be believed. Over 4 years I took 8 plus groups of Americans there and everyone said it was the highlight of their trip."
197,4.0,It is a great place mainly for eating. The place is jam-packed with food stalls serving tasty treats at reasonable prices. However majority of the food is of the oily kind. It is not really a shopping place for tourists. The shopping caters more to the locals for the raw ingredients and traditional clothes and medicines. But it is an eye opener. It situates right next to Dongdaemun which is definitely a tourist shopping haven with shops in Migliore open till late like 4am.
198,3.0,Enjoyed some tasty deep fried food. It was way too busy here for me. Narrow entries filled with tables. There is a major camera and accessory sales area here too... Take your pick!
199,3.0,"We were searching for one of the gates and came across this market. So packed and sooo lively. It was a good experience, but didnt get anything. It was soooo hot that day"
200,4.0,"When in Gwangjang market, we highly recommend the mung beans pancake. Go to the stall with a long queue. The pancakes were light and tasty. The price was reasonable. Its a great place to try out their street food. We could not try out all the food but at least feast with our eyes. Gwangjang market was a good place  to mingle with the locals and experience their cultures.  The market was crowded so we were assured that food should be fresh.Should we be in Seoul, we will go back to try out more more food."
201,4.0,A great place to experience Korean local food where a lot of Koreans actually come here to have their dinner after work. Most of the food stalls here are manned by ahjumas (middle-aged women) and they couldn't really understand English. Food being ordered using hand and sign languages. A perfect place to enjoy cheap local food and experience the local culture. The mungbean pancake is one of the must try here.
202,5.0,"Loads of stalls selling street food, kimchi and other delicacies. You can just sit at one of the tables have eat whatever they are selling for a really cheap price!Only downside is it looked a little grubby and the meat looked like it had been sitting out for a while which no refrigeration. Well worth the visit to have a look round!"
203,4.0,"very crowd market, especially in food area. I tried gimbap, odeng, tteoboki & mug bean pancake here. its so delicious. most stall seller was ahjumma (old lady), and they can't speak english, so we can only use body language here."
204,4.0,"I went Seoul as a honeymoon trip. I went gwangjang market to look for souvenirs. The souvenirs are cheaper those sold in Namsangol village. They sell lots of hanbok too, we were thinking to buy hanbok for toddler but because the cheapest price was 80k won for such a small piece, we didn't buy. There were lots of local Koreans eating street food, so we thought the food served here must be closest to local's taste buds. So we tried sundae (pig intestines stuffed with glass noodles), fried jelly fish, pancakes, and pork knuckles. We were not used to the strong internal organ taste of sundae, but the rest are ok."
205,2.0,"We were lured by the mungbean pancakes to Gwangjang Market. Yes there are a ton of pancake shops, but they do not come cheap (the market seems overloaded by pancake shops). A couple of pancakes racked up a bill over 20000 won, which at other street food places we had never paid more than 10000 won.Good atmosphere of the local ahjummas pushing you around while they try to get from A to B and also some selection of kimchi and seafood (there's a lot more in Busan)Also, a warning about pig's trotters and sausages (these are pig blood with rice wrapped in intestines)... only for the adventurous, and it also costs significantly more than normal street food."
206,5.0,"There are many cooked food stalls in the market. And also many raw food materials, kimchi, clothings, etc. Interesting place"
207,5.0,"If you want an authentic Korean meal, visit this market at night.  The market is filled with blocks of food vendors.  Tteokbokki and Gimbap were some of the traditional dishes we tried.  Sit down at one of the stalls and they will serve you up a dish.  Where ever we sat they were fascinated with us being there.  I don't think we saw another westerner in the market."
208,4.0,"This place is full of stalls selling food, fabric etc! Loved the tteokbukki, kimbap, odeng, bindaetteok! Wished that the stomach can hold more food like the Patju (Red bean porridge)! Didn't dare to try the blood sausage though.  There's this bindaetteok place with seats inside that's rather famous. Do make sure to try the one with the meat as well. :)"
209,4.0,"We visited in the morning so the crowds had yet to descend. We had tteokbokki (spicy rice cake) , glass noodles and fish roll soup for breakfast. The humble food was so good and satisfying! Locals and tourists rubbed shoulders seated side by side by the hot stoves. You can order just by pointing at the food.The ground floor of the market sells a mix of stuff like seafood, (lots of) fabric, sundry items like umbrellas. The upper floor of the market, mainly visited by locals, is air-conditioned and sells mainly Korean household items and traditional garb and trinkets."
210,5.0,"We went to Gwangjang Market to have a ""street food"" experience in Seoul, and it did not disappoint. The hand-cut noodles we got were incredible, and the woman who served us could not have been nicer (although she spoke no English). This should be a must-do stop on any trip to Seoul."
211,5.0,"Gwangjang Shijang is awesome! Now this is the type of experience I was hoping for‚Äîtons of vendors selling a variety of interesting and tasty food. We went at night, so the non-food portion of the market was closing down. But we were there to eat. And eat we did!A popular thing to get is the Mayak Gimbap. It literally means Drug Gimbap. It really is like crack! Not that I've ever had crack. The rolls are smaller than the Gimbap I've had in the past. They are bite size and oh so delicious.We also tried a popular place that makes Jeon (egg pancakes). They had a line out the door. Even Tim Burton ate there and shouted his praises. I enjoyed it, but the oiliness makes it something you can't eat too much of.From Soondae to fresh seafood, if you're an adventurous foodie, you'll find plenty to love at Gwangjang."
212,5.0,"Kwang Jang is a vast indoor market at the junction of two main thoroughfares in central Seoul. It is home to bewildering number of food stalls selling Korean delicacies at affordable prices, and also an array of clothes vendors. If you are looking to buy an embroidered traditional Korean gown, this is the place to visit. You can easily spend a couple of hours browsing in Kwang Jang, enjoyed the colours and the vibrancy."
213,4.0,"We wanted a traditional market experience which is what we got at Gwangjang.  In the evening after work people stream there to buy things for their households or for dinner or for gifts for weddings or birthdays.  Thus you see all kinds of goods in one place.  We didn't have much to buy since we got all our souvenirs in Insadong.  Instead we wanted to sit at a food stall and snack.  There are so many to choose from that your best strategy is to find a stall that has on display what you want to eat and hope the quality and prices are comparable.  We had pig trotters, mung bean pancake and jap chae, not any better than elsewhere, nor cheaper either.But the experience of sitting crunched between tired out working guys and giddy gals headed to a party (judging by the fancy cake box they carried) while being served by a no-nonsense ladyworking behind a shelf full of pig parts was really the closest we ever got to a genuine Korean experience all trip.  Worth going to see, even if you choose not to eat"
214,4.0,"This is a market, make no mistake about it. The place offers you a view into the Korea market, and also provide an opportunity to taste some of the traditional foods that even the local eat. So walk around, find a food you are interested, sit down, point at it, order it and try it!After eating, stroll around the clothes/hanbok section to see if you fancy making a hanbok for yourself, or pick up a packet of korean ginseng sweets. After that, you can drop by the Cheonggyecheon, an eco-friendly drain/canal development, which is just beside near where the market is located."
