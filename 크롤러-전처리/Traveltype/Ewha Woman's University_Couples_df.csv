0,4.0,Very historical university. Beautiful campus with a mixture of historical and modern architecture. Visited during winter and the campus outlook would be good for photography enthusiasts
1,2.0,"As with most of Korea, geared towards women. So if you’re here for clothes shopping it’s a Mecca! A few places to avoid- baviphat- popular cosmetics shop, but with fake prices on everything - you don’t know until you pay. There are also a couple of men’s suit shops, no prices on anything and some with fake prices, all owners exceptionally rude. Don’t buy ANYTHING for men here if you don’t want to be ripped off and of course it goes without saying for any smart foreign guest- don’t buy if there is no price tags"
2,2.0,You would find better in Myeongdong. Overrated street. Not really recommended for a tourist as you can find same or better products in Myeongdong.
3,3.0,I am not really sure why this is listed as one of the must see shopping places in Seoul.  There is nothing unique or really that interesting about the shops here.  Dominated by the same cosmetic stores you see elsewhere it is a few blocks of shopping.  I would not go out of my way to come shopping here.
4,5.0,This area is famous for trend setting fashion among young women. Lots of university students shop here. We visited the area to shop after visiting Ehwa Womans University nearby. This area is very accessible by subway.  Prices were reasonable since the shops cater to the university students. We found some cheap handbags here.
5,5.0,"I really had a lot of fun shopping here. We came here in the morning, so I don't know how busy it gets later in the evening (after the work day and such), but it was a much more peaceful shopping experience here than Myeongdong. Pretty much every major Korean cosmetic brand has a few shops here (Innisfree, Etude House, etc) and a lot of smaller ones as well (like Holika Holika or Labiotte), so you can do a lot of your shopping here if you want. The deals seemed pretty good here too, but I'd already done the vast majority of my shopping in Busan so I didn't buy a lot of cosmetics in the area. You can spend HOUURRRRRRRRRRRRS here looking at clothes. There's something for almost everyone's style from super frilly and feminine to the more baggy sort of streetwear look. I actually didn't buy much, but I was pretty happy when I got a cute little denim jacket for something like 11000W - oh yeah, the prices here are great. There are lots of stores that just specialize in accessories too, like handbags, socks (yes, socks), jewelry, etc. There are also a few men's shops sprinkled around, so my boyfriend wasn't as horribly bored as he usually is on these shopping excursions, plus the neighborhood is pretty cool and interesting too. There were lots of carts selling street food all over the place if you want to get some snacks, but there are also tons of super adorable little cafes that you might want to save room for. We got some snacks early on, and then in the afternoon went to some cute little place run by a really nice lady that was at the end of a little walking alley, I think it was just off one of the ""main"" streets. I have no clue what the place was called (I don't even remember seeing a sign in Korean so I could attempt to deciper the Hangul), but it had a bunch of strawberries on the banner outside. Turned out EVERYTHING on the menu was made with strawberries. We had a couple of (delicious) jam sandwiches and some strawberry tteokbokki (which was still spicy, but with a nice strawberry flavor on it). We also had strawberry lemonade to drink. The restaurant seemed pretty popular with the local uni students as well (my boyfriend was the only guy there, hahah). If you ask around for the strawberry restaurant, maybe you'll have some luck, because I would totally recommend it if you can find it. Anyways, yeah, this is an awesome area to shop and I recommend it to anyone who plans on doing shopping while they're in Seoul. Myeongdong is fun and you should check it out, but this area is way more laid back and fun."
6,4.0,"This is an underrated shopping place in Seoul. Seriously, especially for ladies out there, this is the IT place for shopping! It’s not too crowded, the amount of shops is not that overwhelming, and shops give better offers here. Also, they sell clothes which are very affordable I guess it’s because they are catering to university students. Moreover, the façade of the university is so beautiful. Every spot was “instagrammable” that you couldn’t help but execute your blogger pose. It looked like it came straight out of a European garden book. Lastly, the famous underground complex was simply worth visiting. I myself was amazed at how massive the place was and how beautifully it was constructed. This university just made me jealous at the students who study here."
7,3.0,"We went to this Fashion Street early in the morning at about 10am. Shops start to open and several are still closed.There are shops selling handphone accessories, shoes, socks, bags, clothing and street food.Socks selling at KW$1000.Streets are up and down hills so be prepared to climb up and go down hills while shopping."
8,5.0,It has all of the shopping that a woman desire. The fashion street is big enough for you to shop for days but not much of a place to look for food. Some even visit there for a korean haircut!
9,5.0,"This is a great street to go shopping for Korean fashion.  There are little shops and street vendors everywhere you look.  Trendy, cute, low priced items geared to young, college age students.  Plenty of things for older folks too, socks, jewelry, and much more."
10,4.0,It's near to the Ehwa Uni and will pass through this street as it is along the road toward the university. A shopping street similar to Myeongdong and a place to visit.
11,4.0,"If you are looking for trendy fashion, shop here first before you shop anywhere else! It's very affordable and reasonably good quality. We bought more stuff here than elsewhere in Seoul."
12,3.0,"I found the clothing selling here are similar to other shopping area.  However, most important this shopping street is much more peaceful and quiet than other shopping streets in downtown.  I felt comfortable here.  After visitng Ewha Woman's University, suggest come here to have a lot."
13,5.0,"I was blown away when I arrived at Ewha Women's University Fashion Street: It was chock full of nice eateries and the best place (in my opinion) to score cheaper than usual skincare products and cosmetics! I stocked up on almost a year's worth of skincare products and cosmetics at Baviphat, which you'll definitely stumble upon while roaming the streets of Ewha; and you should be prepared to spend quite a substantial amount of Won if you plan to do some stocking up too! The price range at Baviphat is well below the prices at the stores eg. Laniege, 3CE, Sulwhasoo, Face Shop.. Just to name a few. Don't miss out on exploring the eateries there as well! And did I mention.. Coffeeshops are everywhere in Seoul, so be sure to leave some space in your tummy for coffee after each meal!"
14,5.0,"We were surprised at the prices of clothes, bags and beauty products here - easily up to 40% off from streets like Myeongdong. The unisex bags all at ₩10,000 - I bought 3 bags in one go! We shopped in Myeondong first and kind of regretted buying stuffs there.The beauty products here are also cheaper - a packet of Innisfree face mask at ₩750 per pc compared with Myeongdong at ₩1,000 - ₩1,250. Definitely recommended to spend your money here."
15,4.0,"Seoul Girls Paradise... Coffee Shops, Cosmetics,and clothing. Bring your girlfriend, have some fun in these streets. Many pretty korean girls are shopping in these places or walking around the campus. Recommended!!"
16,3.0,There's a lot of cafes and restaurants on the way to the university. It would be nice if my university have this kind of surrounding too :( There's nothing special about the street. I prefer Hongik University street better.
17,5.0,"Budget Fashion Street for Lady, We notice alots of cosmetic shop and watsons is offer more offer and discount than town Myeongdong for Tourist. Spend minimum 30000w can Tax refund in cosmetic shop. And the clothes is fashionable and budget. We become shopaholic in this area. We will definitely visit here again if we travel to Korea next time."
18,2.0,"Went there in the evening. Just 1 street of shopping, all for women so men should avoid this place at all cost."
19,5.0,"Ewha has a completely different vibe than Hongik. Compared to Hongik, it's not as bustling, there aren't as many stores, and you can't spend as much time here, but this is where I bought the most clothes! take your time to dig through the racks for treasures. Most of the items (skirts, tops) I bought were KRW10,000 or less! and of decent quality. The styles and MUCH better than Dongdaemun. A lot of the stores have fitting rooms too."
20,4.0,"I would recommend this place for ladies shopping as there are lots of shops selling clothes, shoes, cosmetics, skincare products, accessories, etc. The crowd here is young and the fashions/designs are mainly catered to this group of people. The prices are quite reasonable. My partner personally prefer this place compared to Myeongdong or Dongdaemun as the area is not that big and crowded and you can take your time to browse through the things in the shops. The staff are quite friendly. I managed to kill some time in a cafe and had a wonderful cup of coffee whilst my partner does her shopping.Whlst you're here, take a walk around Ewha Women's University for some photo shoot and have lunch at one of the restaurants along the fashion street."
21,5.0,"Lots of clothes and shoes available here (10000 - 30000 won), possibly to cater to the younger (and less financially-capable) crowd here. My partner had an excellent time here shopping for cheap yet fashionable clothing and shoes. There is also a street full of cosmetics and skincare brands.Other than clothes, there are also quite a number of restaurants, cafes, and of course, the street food.Do visit if shopping's your thing."
22,5.0,"Excellent Hotel with excellent service from the girl staff, it's comfortable and home like.Thanks for the girl staff especially, who is so friendly and introduce so much in Seoul to us, it is so... helpful. Nice trip with nice hotel, will choose it next time!"
23,3.0,"Good selection for teenagers, however, some prices are not justifiable. Watch out for certain stores which rip you off and refuse to give a discount on the price they quote you. Worth visiting just for the feel of shopping along a street."
24,3.0,"You can find the similar cosmetic brands along this stretch of street. There are a few sidewalk stalls side street food as well. Nothing special, you can skip if you don't have enough time!"
25,4.0,"Like the Hongik Univeristy Street (Hongdae), this area caters largely to the young student crowd, so expect to find a lot of affordable eateries and cafes (try BeansBin for coffee and waffles!), as well as clothes/accessories shops and boutiques, many driving a good bargain. Being a women's university street, there's of course your expected stream of cosmetics/beauty product shops.I also spotted some student ""volunteers"" acting as guides for visitors and tourists, so feel free to approach them if you are looking for anything in particular to buy (most of the students are articulate in English, which is great for those who weren't able to pick up much of the Korean language before their trip to Seoul)."
26,5.0,"I much preferred shopping for beauty products in this area rather than heading towards Myeongdong as the shops here offer better discounts, are friendly and give more freebies. It's also less crowded, which is a huuuuuge plus point."
27,4.0,"Located just outside the Ewha University it offers variety of Bargain fashion and foodYou do find Some of the Famous Korean Cosmetic like Nature republic there  but go to those small shop where there is a lot of interesting hand made fashion accessories at a bargain price.Go to one of the Dessert shop which serve very Smooth Shaved mango, Red bean or strawberry Milk Ice. Its a must try"
28,5.0,"This is fantastic shopping area for the ladies. If you are looking for accessories and fashion, this is the place to be. :-) Of course, it also has the brand name cosmetic stores as well. During our stay there, there were many buses of Chinese tourists in the area. However, I also see local students shopping for trinkets and whatnot. The inner streets have more interesting items than the main streets and is a fraction of the price. For example, the same hair clip that I saw for 25,000 won on the main street costs 5,000 won on the inner streets. :-) Food here is also delicious, but this is coming from a person who loves Korean food in general. Overall, it's a good place for some girly shopping."
29,3.0,"When we were first brought to this shopping lcoation, I was a little puzzled. Then I realized that there was a huge fashion street within the women's university itself, how cool is that?There were many tiny boutiques and stalls selling clothes of very unique designs (not found in Singapore, of course), at very affordable range price range.  I found some of the designs a little loud and too funky, but it is all good for the young at hear or youthful individuals.THere are also some skincare range and accessories on sale here, hence one is able to get all their shopping done at this one-stop shopping street.For more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/kaptivating-korea.html"
