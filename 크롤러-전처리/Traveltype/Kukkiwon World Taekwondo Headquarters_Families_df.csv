2,5.0,"One of the best Taekwondo demonstration I have seen, the plank breaking was really impressive. Show duration is about one hour and the performance hall is about 10 minutes walk from Gangnam station, exit 12."
3,4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed Kukkiwon's Taekwando demonstration show. It told a story, and combined TKD moves into a narrative with a big screen in the background. I had expected to just see people do some routines. This was much more interesting. The artists did a great job too, with many difficult moves. I deducted a star because, as an english-only speaker, it was hard to get tickets. I had to contact AskAjumma to get tickets for me. And the time of the show was not advertised anywhere that I could find. But once I had the tickets, there was a nice gentlemen at the arena who helped us get seated. After the show they invited people who wanted to break a board to come onto the stage. The emcee spoke English and Korean so my kids were able to join in and broke their first board! Very cool."
4,4.0,"It is a great organization but for a tourist not much of a site to visit unless you go to their demo show ""Great Tae Kwon Do"". It combines legend, a ton of board breaking and action. It was a blast! At the end you can break a board with the cast. Their website sucks so get someone Korean speaking to figure out times."
