0,5.0,went straight up to the cafe where they serves fanciful drinks with candy floss! Great to have candy floss that wont melt during the winter. Great texture. Drinks was ok. Due to the snow the outdoor sitting area was closed. We had to stay indoor. However staff attitude needs to be improved!
1,3.0,"This place was really aesthetic and girly. It's great for Instagram pictures! That's about it. The staff, however, were a little hostile. They seem quite impatient and they glared at customers who didn't buy anything. Can't really blame them, to be honest, they're dealing with annoying customers all day."
2,5.0,Stylenanda Pink Hotel Flagship Store ðŸ’•ðŸ’•Really really good place for lady~~ Must go there.. Recommend!!
3,5.0,"Heard about this place from my colleagues as well as from tourists whom recorded their visit on YouTube. I decided to check it out since I love the pink set up with the hanging  metal frame bed. The pink  pool at the roof top also attract my attention.You will notice this building as it is striking pink.  It occupies at least 6 floor and there is  a lift that bring you up to the top where it is an open space with lots of large pink cushions and a pink pool ( a ladder needed to climb up ). Pool is closed as it is winter. It is actually a Korean cosmetic and apparels concept store with all local designs.  Love the range of lip sticks. I have not seen such a wide range before ( matt, gloss, dual colour ) and various tone. Of course the famous orange shade are available in multiple colours.I love the full concept of design, display of the cosmetics like in a toilet settings. sets of cosmetics or skin care are dispaly in the porcelain sink with golden tap.Some of the changing rooms are in concept of shower room. There is a small cafe that sell very beverages display in a fun way.  Floss candy comes with your hot chocolates. A must for the young and trendy. I bought quite a bunch of cosmetics after 1- 2hours shopping."
