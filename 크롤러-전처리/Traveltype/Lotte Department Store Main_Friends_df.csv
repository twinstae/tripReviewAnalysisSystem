1,5.0,"I really liked this mall, particularly the basement area where the grocery, food court and bakeshops are located. The food available here are all so interesting and varied, from cakes, breads, kimchi, Korean side dishes, to hot dishes that can either be eaten on site or brought home."

4,4.0,"A large department store filled with tourists, we were here on a weekday And it is jam packed. Lots and lots of brand names and luxury goods items. We were a little disappointed that they didn't carry more Korean local designers . But there are a few floors dedicated to duty free shopping. So spend away !"
5,4.0,"Every morning, there is a long line of Chinese tourists forming outside the building and they’re only let it when the department store opens. The tax free floors are between 9-12 while the rest of the building stays closed till their opening time of 1030amThere’s a LINE shop somewhere between floors 9&10 and though it’s not a full fledged shop. They sell most of the popular items like stationary or plushies. They sell in both USD and KRW. But even with the USD conversion rate to KRW, the items are still cheaper to be purchased here than the LINE friends shop! TAX FREE for the win! Enjoy and don’t forget to check out the supermarket on B1. It’s not huge but some of their offer items are damn good! And value for money!"
6,1.0,Items are highly priced. Shopkeepers are arrogant and not friendly. I feel that Koreans are arrogant in reel and real life.
7,3.0,"First impression see the main floor with your standard beauty booths.  When we arrived the top floor; we decided to leave immediately.  The whole top floor was filled with Chinese tourist lined up to purchase their duty free expensive things.  The rest of the floors are pretty standard with different items for each floor.  Finally, we arrived the basement.  There were so many different variety of foods, looking delicious and tasty- it was heaven."
8,4.0,Was in Seoul for Christmas and stayed just next door at the Lotte Hotel Seoul with direct access to Lotte department store.  There are just so many varieties of food at the basement of this department store.  The one that we liked most was the Korea restaurant  somewhere at the end of the store.  They served very good seafood SUNDUBU JJIGAE (KOREAN SPICY SOFT TOFU STEW).  They have also so many good bakeries that are tempting and delicious.
9,5.0,"You must visit Lotte Department Store, the main branch.  If not for shopping but to visit the huge food court, food hall and supermarket.  The supermarket takes up one side, then there are hundreds of small food stands selling every food item imaginable.  Bakeries, wine shops and food shops line the exterior of the room.  At the far end is a large food hall with many food counters where you order food and then take to tables.  The presentation of the food, the high quality and wide selection is unbelievable.  One bakery OPS has luscious pastries, as do most others.  Difficult to pick one over the other.  To reach Lotte, take the green line 2, and get off at Euljiro 1 stop or you can take the blue line 1, and get off at City Hall stop and just walk over.  Take a browsing of the basement food hall.  You will be impressed."
10,3.0,"There is a food court with local food. Side dishes sold at the supermarket is quite reasonably priced but do note to be more firm with the sales assistant. They will attempt to purposely packed more for you and get you to commit to it. Loads of food varieties to choose from and it's a great place to get snacks back as gifts. When there's sale, prices here is cheaper than their market."
11,4.0,"You can find a lot of high end brands here like Gucci, the bread section has an overwhelming display of different kinds of breads and they comes with a free taste which is a good thing. I enjoyed shopping in this mall. The grocery has a lot of fresh fruits to offer, clothing and cosmetic section are so great! I love this mall."
12,3.0,This place is good if you are looking for Made in Korea F&B items. Here you can find a whole battalion of China Chinese buying and grabbing everything in sight.
13,4.0,All items from head to toe and from all the age range can be found in this mall. And all designer things is here also. Its a one stop shop for everything.
14,4.0,What a mall! Lots here for anyone to choose from and it surely is expensive with all the high end brand name clothing. No outlet prices in this mall.
15,4.0,"C1 ( 2016.12.12 ) This Lotte department store brand was number 1. in Korea. I didn't like Lotte, but it was certain that there was very good department store. There was always crowded and many stores located. Especially, there was very good place to shop to foreigner , but too crowded to me."
16,4.0,"Good ambience with all the christmas decorations. Plenty of stuffs to see. But supermarket is quite small. However, if you are looking for the top 10 snacks to buy, you can find it here"
17,1.0,"So I bought a watch in this store and as I needed to obtain it in the airport, I handed my air ticket and passport for the shop assistant to arrange the pick-up time. The assistant wrongly inputted the date as 16/11 when it should have been 6/11. This mistake made me unable to obtain my item for which I had already paid, so I had to stop the transaction made via credit card immediately.What makes it even more frustrating is that the airport staff, after understanding my case, was unable to solve the problem for me. I left Korea without ever obtaining my item.Therefore, I truly found the staff irresponsible and unhelpful."
18,4.0,"This shopping mall is located at Myeongdong, very accessible by train and a popular shopping place for tourist. There are many floors in the building just like any other shopping mall and it's duty free too.We went to the basement floor where they sell food, fresh ones and packaged ones... the whole section is big, you can really get anything you want here and the staff here are very helpful, some can even speak multiple languages. It's a good place to get food souvenirs since there are many choices and you can even sample some of them."
19,4.0,"U must visit when you go to south korea, lotte Department store selling a lot of thing, especially the lotte mart, the fruit and vegetables are fresh, the bread is attractive and delicious. It is worth to go"
20,1.0,"I bought a ELLE 양산 from Lotte department store Bucheon branch last year, and used it for several times last summer .  Because of its quality problem(a screw was off), I  brought back to Lotte Bucheon store to repair it.  However, there is no more ELLE .  The ELLE counter left Lotte Bucheon.  So my purchased product became a homeless without after-service. Lotte Bucheon 's second floor cashier/customer center lady  asked me to pay 15,000won to repair the parasol.  I  told her it was caused by its poor quality, I  didn't break it.  But she said that there was no free after-service for every brand's parasols & umbrellas.  Very shocking.  Can someone from Lotte Department Store explain it to me, or follow up with it?"
21,4.0,"Is good shopping mall with five floor for family clothes, accessories,shoos The price its far with quality products and design"
22,5.0,"Bought some local snacks, Happy Call cooking pan cause its wayyyy cheaper than backhome! No plastic bags for free, but boxes are provided! fun shopping experience!"
23,4.0,"Always is a ""MUST"" for me visiting the Lotte Duty free products for foreigners while visiting Korea . Is easy to walk from Dongdaemun or Myeongdong . That's few floors for foreigners to shop for branded goods , foodies and skincare that we may pay but collect at airport  ,  we can enjoy buying as much and won't affected our baggage weight because goods will be collecting after check in baggage and security check . Some months may have super special deal for different credit cards holder. Nice."
24,4.0,This is not for the faint of heart. The size is amazing and you'll find lots of HIGH END merchandise here. It's in the heart of Seoul in Myongong. 7 levels of shopping in the main store and multiple side areas. But the prices are very high end. TIP: you can get here very easily by subway.
25,4.0,"We were a bit let down by shopping opportunities in Seoul, we thought it would be more like Tokyo and it isn't, so when we found Myengdong area and it's shopping opportunities we were happier :) Lotte department store was mostly out of our budget as it sells mainly higher end cosmetics and clothes, bags and other goods but if you are looking for higher end goods this is your place to go. The Shu Uemura section here is quite large as well and the staff was very helpful in getting us what we were looking for plus gave us a large pile of samples for free as well. Otherwise I'd suggest the neighbourhood around the department store- good quality, but cheaper cosmetic and clothing stores (even the western ones) and lots of cafes, restaurants and food stalls. The department store has a nice toilet though hahah :)"
26,1.0,"Great and stylish and huge department store! However when trying to pay with MasterCard , my understanding was (told by a salesgirl with lousy English skills) that MasterCard is not accepted in Lotte. Then another girl on interpreter desk ( yes that was really the name...) told that MasterCard is not accepted in while Korea. That i already knew to be rubbish and told her that i had been uusina the sane card several times in stores much smaller and less fancy. Because of the poor English skills of the personnel they lost a customer and trust in their expertise- and I still dont know why my card wasnt accepted. Would like to send them feedback but apparently their customer care does not have any email address or another channel either - loading an apps should not be the only option..."
27,4.0,"This is a great place to shop but it's not cheap. My favorite place was their basement which had different types of food. If you're looking for quality name brand clothes, they have a large selection."
28,4.0,I have been to Myeongdongwhen I saw this department store It is very cheap than TAIWAN SHOOPING  there is very happy
29,4.0,I really like the duty free shopping here. It gives you loyalty card for certain amounts you spend there. The service in korea is rather unique. They secure your flight details and arrange for collection only upon your departure.
30,4.0,The Duty Free Shops from 9F to 11F. So many people（mainly Chinese Travel Groups) in 9F(Cosmetic products). 10F & 11F for luxury brands. Most of staff can speak some Chinese. Customer place the orders there and pick up the products via the windows of LOTTE at the airports (Incheon & Gimpo) before they depart. They don't need to carry the shopping bags to next place. This is a very smart sales model in Asia and accepted by most of people. Also there is a supermarket/food mart on basement besides food court area.
31,4.0,Spent hours just in the basement and looking at the foods. Definitely need to allocate more hours if you plan to look around till you are content.
32,4.0,"well, beside floor 9-11th on free tax store, which I dont really interested in . Beside, too many tourist crowded floor and the customer services are not that polite compare to other stores / floor. You should however, pay a visit to their basement on the food court area. Very interesting place to look at."
33,2.0,"I purchased a purse from the lotte duty free store had to wait till I got to the airport to pick up my purchase. Let's just say the boxed item they showed me at the store, the purse was in great form!  The tissue was wrapped around the zipper pull, the protective bag was in the box. By the time I picked up the purchase at the airport, it was not the same exact purse the lady showed me. I remember details. The protective bag was missing and the purse didn't look as new as the one I was presented with at the store. So somewhere between the time I purchased the purse someone swapped out my purchase and taken out the simple protective bag?  I will never buy from them again as I do think trust them. I emailed the specialty stores to make my complaint. A purse is not complete with missing parts!"
34,4.0,"Typically large Deaprtment store, Top floor is a typically food area with lots of chopice. it also has a floor with Duty Free goods. Korea airport is cheaper."
