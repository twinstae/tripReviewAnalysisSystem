0,4.0,KTX offer a pleasant travel between many cities in Korea. You can fully trust the time schedule and the ride is smooth. WiFi means you can work or leisure without problem. They don’t sell coffee though.
1,5.0,"Great way to travel. Not on the same level as the Japanese Shinkansen, it still is wonderful, easy, and comfortable. Highly recommend using it!"
2,4.0,"I have taken the KTX numerous times for work and vacation. I have not had a bad experience yet caused by Korail. Their app works well, but you cannot buy tickets within 20minutes of the train departing. Even if there is an error it is best to check/refund ticket before trying to buy another ticket in case the first one went through. All the staff I have dealt with in Daegu and Seoul have spoken clear English. Their trains are delayed more often than Japanese ones. If you get a first class ticket you get free bottled water and some snacks. You can get standing room only tickets which means you can seat in an open seat but must give it up if someone that has a ticket for that seat comes through. The standing room only tickets are cheaper than any other ticket. The seats are comfy and normally have an outlet and USB outlets. With regular seats, it is odd as they don't rotate so the center seats face each other and all the seats after face towards that center row. It is an odd feeling to be traveling facing the opposite direction."
3,5.0,"Travelled between Busan and Soeul without any worries. Speed about 300km/hr. Very comfortable, lots of room, far more than any plane. A better way to travel!"
4,5.0,Loved their schedule and onetime service. Great train and network to be in and around Korea. This service is at par with anything in Europe.
5,5.0,"A great trip, I upgraded to first class. Very quiet and comfortable. Power and USB outlets for each row"
6,4.0,"I usually take a KTX train. It still fast and quiet. However, the train was not clean so smell waa not good. We can also take a SRT train.The KTX trains are neended to change a new one.Sometimes the arrival time could be delayed due to an accidental event."
7,5.0,"Seoul Station to Deaugu, KTX is the best means of transport. KTX makes my visit very easy and comfortable. To and fro same day is only possible via KTX. Further being a foreigner, we do not have local sim or any 4G facility, thanks to KTX for free high speed WIFI."
8,4.0,I Have considered this option only because my route gave me no alternatives...It is not a cheap way to move from Busan to Seoul and viceversa (as well as Korean Air flights every hour at a very reasonable price) but I have enjoyed the free wifi and the comfortable sears
9,5.0,I have taken the train a couple of times between Seoul and Gumi. They are very comfortable and always on time. Great way to travel in South Korea.
10,5.0,"I have travelled on KTX in economy and First class, it is an excellent way to travel, the trains are very punctual"
11,5.0,then use the KTX. Nice and smoth from A to B on low fares. Don't use the crowded roads. Tickets are easily to get online. Even for foreigners. So check it out.
12,5.0,"So far I have traveled for at least 5 times with KTX during my business trips to Korea and every single time I’m super impressed. Trains are always on time, Internet works well, seats are very comfortable and there are sufficient space. Super clean and tidy etc. The price of a train tickets is a bit high, but the travel is worth the money. It’s Very convenient!"
13,4.0,Great service. Enjoyed the ride from Busan to Seoul.The online booking process was efficient. Collecting the tickets from Busan station was quick.
14,4.0,The KTX is the best way to travel from Seoul to Busan. The fast speed train only takes 2.5 hours for the 330 km. The seats are not luxurious but comfortable enough. The train makes the most sense for this distance.
15,5.0,I took the KTX from Seoul to the Olympic village and again it was fast and efficient;  it will get you anywhere you need to go in Korea.
16,4.0,"I took an early morning train from Seoul Station to Cheonan city. Train arrived on-time and it was a comfortable ride.Even it was more expensive than taking the underground train to Cheonan, it was worth to take KTX which provided much faster service."
17,5.0,A super easy way to travel far and fairly inexpensive. I was able to do a day trip from one end of the country to the other with ease. Just be careful if you fall e. The ride is smooth and you might miss your stop.
18,4.0,"Clean trains, but no services inside, also the guidance to buy ticket is not easi to find out. Price level is quite good."
19,5.0,"Efficient, punctual, comfortable, wifi. Well-priced passes for foreigners that can be cheaply upgraded to first class. What's not to like? NOTE KTX is the long distance bullet train, NOT the airport train. The airport train is AREX."
20,5.0,"I use this all the time in Korea. It is clean, safe, and affordable. I am the SRT and ITX are also available and sometimes necessary alternatives but generally speaking, the KTX is the way to go. Most Europeans and Japanese are fond of it and of course American have nothing to compare it too."
21,4.0,"Whilst on business, I needed to travel from Seoul to Yesu for one of my meetings. Although I am an experienced traveller and have used the Janpanese and Chinese rail systems, this was my first time using the high-speed trains in South Korea.Great on-line booking system meant that I had my tickets ahead of arrivibg in Seoul & a great service on my journeys.Recommended."
22,5.0,"We travelled a lot by this amazing train, called KTX during our stay in South-Korea. It is very fast and comfortable seating, all clean washbasins. Staff is very polite and kind. (never asked for our tickets..) Wifi is awesome on board.Recommended."
23,4.0,"some carriages are spacious, quiet carriage good for carrying out work. food drink service is not bad either"
24,4.0,"If you plan to travel within South Korea, I would highly recommend using the KTX trains vs flying.  The service is extremely reliable and a far better option to flying.    The trains are clean and very smooth riding.   Don’t fly within South Korea, take the train."
25,3.0,"I went to Seoul on a Wednesday from Gwangju on a Wednesday and returned a little more than a month later on a Saturday. Since I don't know exactly what time I will arrive at the station, I want to pay able to walk in and buy at my convenience without having to wait a long time to take the trip, but both times, I had to wait an hour an a half for the next train. If there were enough trains running, so that passengers could take a train every thirty minutes, it would be better, as it takes about three hours to make the trip, including the wait time, and about three and a half hours by bus, which is much cheaper. In the case of buses, you can catch them much more frequently. Additionally, for the few number of trains going between Gwangju and Seoul, the price is rather high at nearly 50,000 won for a such a short distance. When I was in China, the fares were much cheaper, so taking the train was much more economical than in Korea."
26,5.0,"KTX made it possible for people to have 1 day tour with KTX return. I even visited Yeosu, located in far Southern Part of Korean Peninsula within 1 day. I bought the first KTX from Yongsan Station to Yeosu and returned to Seoul dinner time. I prefer VIP ticket for KTX. The VIP seats are more comfortable + VIP ticket holders can use KTX VIP Lounge."
27,4.0,"For long distance affordable travel, KTX is the way to do it in Korea.There's first and normal class tickets, but if you really want to take a particular train, there is standing tickets as well.However, the mobile app (English version) needs work. First, it seems like it does not accept Amex card payment though it is listed as one of the acceptable payment options. Next, when I viewed the seating availability on the app, it tells me a particular train is full, but when I used the webpage, it tells me there is still seats available. Lastly, if using the app, pressing back to change say timing, you will need to choose the location again. This app needs some work to make it better."
28,5.0,"The two hour, forty five minute ride from Busan to Seoul was a delightful experience. I had read some reviews about the challenges some had with booking or reservation, so I purchased my ticket in cash two days to my trip. It turned out to be a wise move as vehicular traffic on the Thursday afternoon was horrendous. No matter, I entered the station early enough. The lady at the Information desk spoke fluent English and was quite helpful.The train departed at 2 pm on the dot. The air conditioning was efficient. Water bottles were available to pick before and during the ride. The toilet in my coach 3 was clean. The coach was quiet throughout, except for the announcements about arrivals at towns along the route. Passengers who needed to make or receive calls walked out of the cabin.The speed was about 300 kilometres per hour , only slowing down as stations were approached.On arrival at Seoul Central station, I was pulling my two cases towards the lift and from nowhere a porter emerged and put the luggage on his cart and wheeled it off speedily as I followed behind. He put my stuff in a taxi, told me how much my fare was and sped off to help others. I had to stop him to offer a generous tip which he received thankfully and resumed his flight back to help others. His attitude is part of what made this train trip a memorable experience."
29,1.0,"Korea Rail stinks if you are not Korean. You can not alter your reservation if you are a non-corean,  I intentionally mis-spelled the name because of how the Koreans treat you like dirt in this country if you are not Korean.  The 2018 olympics will be a disaster if they don't divert their noses from the sky and actually recognize their INSANE ARROGANCE.    This is the 1940's south in the USA.  Wake up.  Your subways are great, and broadcast in many languages.  So many other systems are very self centered."
30,4.0,Travelled 1st class. Nice seal and efficient. Cabin is carpetted and charging point (power socket & 2 x USB) provided. Comfortable but price almost double of economy.Will travel again.
31,4.0,"The Korean KTX system spans the country and one of the most frequent routes is from  Seoul to Busan. The express train took only two hours and fifteen minutes to reach Busan from Seoul Station. This train has very limited stops. Even the with more stops on the return the travel time was two hours forty minutes back to Seoul.Business class seats are around 87000 won and have more leg room, nicer material, a free biscuit and nuts and electrical outlets. Wifi is also included although can drop out from time to time. Carriages are quiet so phone conversations can be made in the space in between carriages. In Seoul connections with taxi and subway is easy and convenient for the onward journey."
32,5.0,"Even though there is currently a transportation strike, the transit system remains fairly easy to use. There are not as many trains, but things are still running pretty smoothly. The seats are comfortable, not too hot or cold, the announcements are made of what station you are at in both Korean and English. People are very helpful and professional and pleasant. The one caveat - buy your ticket as early as possible if you don't want to stand. It's much better that way. If you have to change your time / day, you can do so at the station."
33,3.0,"I took the KTX from Seoul Station to Busan Station for a work trip. Things that were good include ease of purchase of ticket and getting to the platform and comfortable seat and quiet compartment. Bad things were the train stopped 6 times along the way and I saw no option for an express no stop train when I booked on KTX online. Bad things include no extra service in first class, just a slightly wider seat. No water, no snack, nothing else included. Some apple slices and a bottled water would have made first class seem, first class. Also no USB cord and no headphones handed out for the in car tv. Just sit down and ride, quietly. There was a food cart selling food, same as regular class."
34,5.0,This thing goes nearly 200 miles an hour it's quieter than a minivan and smoother than a luxury SUV.  If you don't love this there something wrong with you get you from one end of the Korea to the other in less than three hours
35,4.0,If you are going from Busan to Seoul. This is the fastest way. Ok yes. The plane is faster. But you then have to go to the airport and wait. I have taken KTX several times now. And it is always on time and always comfortable. If you go 1st class. A ticket is like 80.000W. That is worth it.
36,5.0,The ride was smooth and the seating was very spacious. I recommend this mode of travel for those who don't have a car while visiting Korea. Just ensure you know where your stop is otherwise you may end up somewhere you didn't intend to.
37,5.0,"I've rode trains around the world, and KTX is at the top. We rode a few times throughout our trip, and each experience was easy - even for someone who doesn't speak the language. It is clean and moves fast!"
38,5.0,"If you expect a ""train station"" to be a place covered in graffiti and inhabited by heroin addicts then you will be sorely disappointed by the KTX station in Seoul. Clean, devoid of weirdos, and packed with shops, restaurants, and clean bathrooms this will change the way many view train travel. Signage is in Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and English. Automatic ticketing is available if you have a credit card and the screens can be switched to English. For a roomier and more relaxing ride upgrade to first class for a nominal fee."
39,4.0,"Very comfortable, accurate, ang great alternative to flying. The first class cars need upgrade to include power plugs and USB ports. However, it should be ranked very high compared to its global competitors, probably second to the Japanese Shinkansen."
40,5.0,Every time I come to Korea I ride the KTX. The ride is very smooth trains run strictly on time and they even give free water.
41,5.0,"Went from Seoul to Daejeon return for business and what a great experience. Clean, efficient and fast. You hardly know you are moving as the noise and vibration levels are so low. Great service on-board with food and drinks that come to you. All up, a great way to travel. Travelled first class and great seats, comfortable and relaxing."
42,4.0,"The KTX trains have very comfortable seats. Booked the first class seat to and from Busan. Leg room and comfortable seat is top priority to me for long rides due to back issues and it met my expectation. They have a staff that goes around selling food in case you get hungry during the trip. Travel time to Busan is 2 hours and 40minutes. To get good seats, book in advance. I booked all my train rides upon exchanging my KR pass. Updgrades to first class is available. I paid 11,900 for a first class upgrade to Busan (one-way). There are 3 seats per row for first class and 4 seats per row for economy. The economy seats are not bad either."
43,2.0,"Other than the fact that it goes fast and there's decent hot coffee on the train, not much I can say for Ktx. Even on the website one does not find English timetables anywhere. So each time I had to stop by the information desk at Seoul station to fund out which one stopped by my station on the way.On the train itself I have repeatedly seen a theme playing out. At first I thought it random occurrence but I'm a monthly pass holder and travel daily so could not ignore the repeated episodes of this. I won't call it racism or such, leave that to be decides by readers and be prepared if you're an expat in Korea on a ktx. If you're an expat in a sea of Koreans within a ktx, you'll probably be quizzed by the ticket inspector to show your ticket. Koreans rarely are checked. All expats always are. As a pass holder with cheap rates, you're allowed to sit anywhere if seats are unreserved or unoccupied. Reserved seats take priorities. They tell you that. Fine! But what they don't tell you is you can be  asked to vacate your seat for a Korean, even if they are same category as you are ( without  reservation). I do not call that good service to expats no matter all the ""bowing"" and the ""khamsamida"" ( thank you in Korean) they dish out! Not the first time I find Koreans very racially biased and have an air of arrogance about them.Anyway expats please keep your I keys handy. And don't be hurt if inky you are being asked to show your ticket."
44,5.0,"Better than any high speed rail experience I have had in Europe.  Good service, efficient, on time and easy to use.  Don't hesitate to use the KTX to get around the country"
45,5.0,"Very smooth and fast, and always on time.  Signs were in Korean and English. Very convenient between Seoul and Busan (moreso than flying).  Definitely recommend!"
46,5.0,"Took the KTX from Seoul to Osong station. I was amazed how the KTX changed a 4-hour bumpy bus ride into a smooth, 2-hour trip.The only sound you hear at 280km/h is the gentle whupwhupwhup of electrical poles rushing past."
47,5.0,"The KTX train system is simply the best way to travel inside Korea. I use the KTX for daily commuting from Seoul Station to Cheonan-Asan when I am visiting my company in Korea.300 kmh, smooth travel, comfortable seats and impeccable commitment to the timetable make the KTX train system one of the most efficient in the World.On a previous trip, I also travelled from Seoul to Busan (top to bottom of South Korea) and found it to be a wonderful way to view the scenery of Korea while zipping along at 300kmh.Onboard complimentary wireless was great to stay connected while travelling.My only complaint is the lack of an English version mobile app for Korail. That would be great to help book your seats in advance."
48,5.0,The train is really fast but very comfortable too. The seats are reserved so they normally don't check the tickets. Took seoul to Busan line. I would recommend this train to travel around Korea.
49,4.0,the KTX is a very easy way to travel between Seoul and Busan. I took the Train from Seoul Station to Ulsan and the ride was very comfortable and fast. Highly recommended way to travel within Korea.
50,4.0,"I used the train from ICN to Busan. The train was on time. The trains were World Class. The only complaint i had was for the leg room. I guess, I'm an exception being about 6 feet 2 inches tall, so that's a problem in most countries, especially Asian countries. European trains seemed to have better legroom. All in all, very pleasant, very convenient."
51,5.0,"Recently I was in Korea on business, and needed to get from Seoul to Busan.  We could have driven, but elected to take the KTX.  Getting tickets at the Seoul Station was easy, and cost something like $54 per person, one way.  Train was clean, comfortable, and on time.  It takes about 2 hours, 40 minutes to get to Busan, which is at the other end of the line.  Train attendants were friendly and sharply dressed women that reminded me of well groomed flight attendants.  Not the often times gruff attendants I have encountered on Amtrak.The train often traveled in the 160 to 170 mph range, and at times over 185 mph.  This was according to my hand held GPS, and the occasional display on the video monitors in the cars.  Ride was very smooth.  Much smoother than Amtrak, which travels at about 1/3 to 1/2 the speed.Had free WiFi, which was nice in that I could catch up on my email to family and work back in the states.  Used my iPhone WiFi capability in airplane mode, so that I did not have to pay for international roaming.  Worked great.Return trip to Seoul was on a Sunday evening, and the train station way busy.  We got to Busan station around 4:30 PM, and found the KTX was sold out until just after 9:00 PM.  Mind you, KTX trains were leaving for Seoul roughly every 20 to 30 minutes.  We had to wait, but not a big deal.  Plenty of places to get a bit to eat, then relaxed on the train to Seoul.  While waiting, I was noticing on the display board (with train numbers, departure times, track #'s, etc.), none of the trains were reporting delays.  Everything seemed to be running on time, despite the heavy traffic, ridership, and rain.  Amazing!  Amtrak could learn something here.We road economy, which was fine.  For such a relatively short ride, I see no reason to spend $$$ on the upgrade to 1st class.  Had plenty of leg room.  (after being stuffed into the cattle car section of a Boeing 747 for 13+ hours, anything had better leg room)  Dragging our luggage was a bit of a challenge, but the overhead racks were able to handle it.  (We definitely looked like typical Americans with all our stuff.)If in Korea again, and KTX goes where I need to go, I would definitely use KTX again."
52,4.0,"Used KTX for my business travel. I knew about the korail website but decided to just stop at the station to by since my times were not set and I wanted to travel a little more freely. I arrived at ICN and took the express train into Seoul Station. I just followed the signs to the KTX counter (seemed to be about 8 stories higher than the platform for the ICN train). Easily got a first class ticket from the counter person, and they took my magnetic stripe Amex card!!!! The tracks were very close, boarded and left. All within 5 minutes. 2:40 minutes later and right on time I arrived at Busan! Trip back was mostly the same. The ride is very smooth, food is available on board. The seats were super comfortable. no power outlets, even in first class. So make sure if you need power that you are fully charged."
53,5.0,"KTX in Korea is easy, economic rapid ground transport with scenic view of both modern and more traditional Korea.  Korean rail system offered both one way ticket and pass program to explore the peninsula.  Having experienced the ICE in Europe and KTX in Korea, I must say they are two peas in a pod with two differentiable genetics to satisfy the host culture.  You will pleased with Korean courtesy and snack service carts.  Highly recommend this experience for those who want a cultural taste of people, place and things. Google KTX for info in several languages.  All rail info and announcements are in Korean and English."
54,5.0,"I have always wanted to go on a Bullett train. I was not disappointed. It was fast, and ""clickety-clack"" free. comfortable and even a cinema car, although it was not operational on the train i was on. The conductors and train manager make many trips up and down the train and bow when entering and leaving each carriage. Food service also available. Wifi was available, but I couldn't get it to work on my iPad. 2.30 hours from Busan to Seoul."
55,5.0,The KTX is an excellent way to get to the south west of Korea. I had a business meeting in Gumi and jumping on the KTX got us to the Gimcheon/Gumi station in a little over an hour. The downside was getting from there (the station is almost literally in the middle of nowhere) to Gumi proper. The taxi was cheap (by US standards) but added an additional 45 mins. The return leg had a similar wrinkle as the Seoul Station terminus is in the north of the city. If you're staying south of the river be prepared for a long subway or taxi ride.
56,5.0,"Typically, left on time, arrived on time. caught a nap.Seoul Station is easy to use BUT if you are expecting air conditioning in the station -not going to happen, bring a change of clothes if you are carry a lot of bags."
57,5.0,"Probably the best and definitely the fastest way to travel between the cities. The schedule is perfect - KTX trains leave every 10-15 minutes, no delays, and no problems. It takes less than 3 hrs and only 50,000 won to get from Seoul to Busan. The only minus is that you have to book ahead if you're planning to travel on the weekend - tickets are selling like fresh bread!"
58,5.0,"This is a very impressive train service in South Korea.  It is very fast and very clean and convenient.  I recommend buying tickets online or in advance as the trains can fill up quickly, particular on Friday evenings."
59,4.0,"Well it cannot be compared to shinkansen of japan, but is the best way to travel long distances."
60,5.0,"Took the KTX several times, this time by myself. For non-Korean speakers, the friendliness of the staff and their English speaking abilities are a huge plus. Travelled first class, worth it in my opinion. The seats are spacious. There are power outlets, and in all carriages you have free wifi. Excellent."
61,4.0,"This railway was taken by me quite regularly for business purposes while temporarily assigned to Daegu. I rode this line in excess of eight times and found the atmosphere to be extremely conducive to sleep, the use of laptops, tablets and other portable devices. The staff were deferential, professional and quite accomodating. All seats are assigned and staff go out of their way to ensure you are undisturbed throughout your trip."
62,5.0,"i used KTX and check in in seoul station, then i have time to have my meal, went for Sunday Missal at Myeongdong Cathedral and did my last minute shopping (myeongdong or naedaemun)very expensive compared to commuter ( tripple the price) W11000 for KTX, only W3100 by commuter on airport line."
63,5.0,"Took the train from Seoul to Yeosu to Expo 2012. Beautiful train, timely, and inexpensive (in 1st class)."
64,5.0,"Booking the tickets are easily done online from anywhere in the world. No problems with collecting the tickets from the ticketing counter at Seoul and Busan Stations. Departure and arrival are on time. The seats are comfortable, beverages and light refreshments are served on board. There is even free WiFi service. Announcements and screen displays are in Korean and English. The staffs are friendly and helpful. I highly recommend it but book a seat for convenience. The extra charge is worth it especially if you plan to board in between terminus or have problem travelling backwards. Well done KoRail."
65,5.0,"Very nice and clean train, fast, and comparatively cheap if you are used to European prices..."
66,5.0,I went to Seoul to Gyenogju. in just  2.30 hrs at 321km/hr. Amazing. I completly enjoyed spacious seat and no travel tiredness.
67,5.0,"Train travel is excellent in Korea.  The KTX pluses are: fast, always on time, able to reserve on-line, only 40 cents if you cancel a trip and comfortable.  The negatives are no self serve kiosks so you have to wait in line to get your actual ticket and the price is moderately expensive.  While cheaper than Japan, it is comparable to Chinese trains, guess this really means they are reasonably priced ($US40 from Seoul to Gumi in first class).  First class offers three seats across vs. four and probably worth the slight extra cost.  You can book on-line at korail.com."
68,5.0,"I had never been on a high-speed train before. It was really easy, REALLY fast, and makes only one stop between Seoul and Busan. Don't even think about taking the ""regular"" train. You save so much time going this way, and it's WAY more comfortable."
69,4.0,Waiting for the KTX train we tried one of the station restaurants with local cusine. It was way over what we expected
70,4.0,"The KTX is an affordable and fast way to head down to the nether regions of Korea on the weekends. Here are some tips for getting around there. If you have a long layover, I would recommend using the coin operated lockers in the Lotte Supermarket next door. They have return coin lockers of various sizes and if your luggage doesn't fit, you can have the customer service desk store it away in the back room. They do it for shoppers so you should be polite to buy something small in the store before you retrieve your bags.Eateries in the train mall are limited by your typical franchises, many overpriced like the Paris Baquette, and Jason Krazur? bakeries- so expensive for some buns! Coffee is over priced except for in the fast food chains but then I've been told coffee here are very low quality and suspicious healthwise. Korean coffee is expensive because traditional people here sold coffee in salons where you paid for the place to meet people at a private table, not the coffee itself. Korean's don't meet people in their homes usually as homes are very small. I would shop for food to take with you at the Lotte Supermarket and eat on the train. Don't forget to get some tea or bottled water and maybe some cheaper pizza to go.Weekend rates (Fri-Sun) are 15% more than weekday rates. Tickets are a little difficult to read so be sure you know your train car and seat number in advance... And be on board 5 minutes before departure as last minute rush makes it crazy onboard at the last minute. Warning on seats though, if you are a large or tall foreigner, get the larger 1st class seats. You will be so uncomfortable in the regular cars as they are made for Korean-sized folks."
71,5.0,"Fast!! Highly recommended, and great value for money. No ear pressure problems, even in tunnels, due to sophisticated pressure systems. Loved it!"
72,4.0,"There could be one or two more trains per day at the smaller stations, but for the price, I am not going to complain too loudly.Treat yourself and go first class....Wifi was there, but I couldn't get online....All in all, a decent train at an incredible price."
73,4.0,"The train, KTX is fast and convenience. It is not too new but not too old. Seats on first class are huge but not big space for suitcases. Accurate timing."
74,4.0,"Not sure how this is an ""attraction"" but anyway, the KTX is a great way to travel around Korea -- only 90 minutes to Daejon, only 2 1/2 hours to get all the way across the country to Busan?  Why would you fly?"
