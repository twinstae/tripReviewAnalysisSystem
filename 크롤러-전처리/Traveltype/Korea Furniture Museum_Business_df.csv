0,5.0,"This private museum, only accessible by appointment, has been a real discovery for me, a hidden treasure. It is a set of palatial houses recovered from various sites in Korea, which make up an architectural ensemble of great beauty. Inside there is a series of furniture from different periods, uses and woods. The person who leads the guide in English is really didactic and friendly. In summary, essential visit despite its distance from the center of Seoul and the absence of public transport to get there, except taxi of course."
1,5.0,I went with a group for a cultural tour and was quite impressed. The guided tour was quite informative and interesting. Be sure to make a reservation in advance.
2,5.0,This private museum in the hills above Seoul is a gem!!  You can only visit by making reservations in advance but highly worth it. They have brought houses from across korea to this location and have a collection of over 2000 furniture pieces with about 500 on display.  it is wonderfully arranged and the guides are excellent.  You learn more about Korean culture with a visit here than just about anywhere!  If you have time--and interest in learning more about Korean culture then you must visit.
