0,5.0,"The food court at the basement is great! Clean and affordable price. Free WiFi, nice kids area at level 7. Wish the staff could be friendlier but my daughter was only playing as we couldn’t lug the toys back to sg. Nonetheless this was the mall we kept going back as is easy with kids!"
1,3.0,"Visited the shopping mall in june 2019. Mostly expensive brands. Could also find shots like Nike and Adidas, but with quite high prices. Food court in the basement."
2,4.0,"The main reason for visiting was to go to a family friends restaurant. It was quite confusing getting to the basement food court. Once you find it, the restaurants aren't clearly labeled. There is another doorway entrance that will lead you to the underground market which is not where you want to go. These are two separate places. The food court in the mall is within the mall. Yeah I know that is obvious. The mall itself is a high end mall with very expensive boutique stores. It is pretty clean and in an area that has a lot of traffic, as is with most places in Seoul. Unless you go to the back alleys. I got a sense of haughtiness and it wasn't very inviting. The service was kinda slow at the restaurant. I wouldn't go back to shop. I wouldn't go back to eat."
3,5.0,This place is first of have most of the branded high end quality product.It's packed with tourist .There is all Range products for kids and grown up.We enjoyed shopping here .Pop in early to avoid crowd .
4,4.0,Food court is big and pretty nice.It's close from Myeongdong Street and Namdaemun Market. Crowded by many foreign tourists.
5,4.0,"In every country, there is always this top end department store such as JC Penny in the US, Takashimaya in Japan, etc. Shinsegae is of similar concept in Seoul."
6,4.0,This is a fairly large mall with the usual brands available as as well a supermarket and food hall.   It is similar to other Shinsegae Department Store throughout the country.
7,4.0,"A major departmental store in Seoul, it houses a variety of luxury and average brands under one roof.  Not much bargains here if that's what you r looking for."
8,4.0,"We went primarily to go cosmetic and food hall shopping.The food hall is nice but in no way is world class when compared to the food halls of Japan. It’s like comparing LeBron James to a 4 foot tall high school basketball player in a wheelchair.There is a nice Korean bakery, nice fishcake shop, a few higher end pastries there, Royce’s chocolates were there too. The supermarket itself is mostly imports from Europe. None of the employees spoke enough English to help with detailed questions.I just was expecting more but was disappointed."
9,4.0,"Initially we thought this to be just another expensive high end department store, and it really is huge. But we discovered that the basement is a really huge and very nice food court selling all kinds of delicious foods and very classy. The prices here were not cheap but the food is well presented and very nice indeed.At the higher floor of the Shinsegae tower is a craft centre where we put our daughter to do some creative craft work which made this place even more of an interesting place. As for general shopping, we found the prices to be high but the choice to be very nice, good clothing brands and great products. But we do plan to visit here again especially for the food court and the craft centre."
10,3.0,very good department store for high end goods.  every level has a different kind of goods from kids to men and women and electronics.  if you go to Myeongdong then its worth a quick visit.
11,4.0,"This is a nice department store with 4 floors of duty free shopping. As is typical of other department stores, the first floors sells cosmetics and beauty items, followed by fashion and home then duty free. It was more spacious than the others."
12,3.0,"I've never shopped at a duty free department store, so it's my ignorance that I didn't know that you don't get the goods right then UNLESS it's manufactured/sold by a Korean company. But even buying Korean goods is a hassle. For example,when buying a  Kakao Ryan backpack, I needed to provide my passport AND return boarding pass. The employees I found to be very brusque and even surly and unhelpful. Will not go back."
13,4.0,"We just visited the other day and its huge,its like Macys,name brands and expensive.Just looking around from 10th floor to basement which is a foodcourt and supermarket.Its clean and near Namdaemun market."
14,4.0,"After spending Sunday morning wandering after through Namdaemun market, my son wanted to have lunch in Shinsegae Dept store. On the basement level of Shinsegae’s main store in downtown Seoul is a food street of many private and locally well known restaurants and food shops. The decor is refined and the food stores are open chef kitchen style. My sons vegetarian so we shared an Indian vegetable curry and fresh cooked naan set from Agra.Prices are a little bit higher but so is the decor and ambience.The food street meanders through the basement level and is quite busy and bustling during meal times. Nevertheless a good refuge and alternative to those not keen on the street food outside."
15,4.0,"Shinsegae is a huge shopping center. In Poland shopping centers have 3 floors but in Korea they have much more floors. I think there are all ""big name"" stores. You should go there in the morning.Shinsegae gördüğüm en büyük alışveriş merkezlerinden biri. Oraya kesinlikle sabah kalabalık olmadan gidiniz."
16,4.0,"Nice shopping center in easily accessible location. Better than Lotte Main. Possible to get tax refund immediately. However, prices are expensive."
17,4.0,Wanted to get some luxury bags in Shinsaegae but i did not bring my passport. It was the requirement to show our passport for:1. Identification purpose to have a tax free purchase2. To key in our details and they would ask u for your outbound flight number (remember your flight number!)3. Because our goods purchased are to be collected at the airport upon our outbound flight. They needed the passport to verify in store and in the airport.The lady allowed me to show a picture of my passport but unfortunately i didnt keep it in my mobile. So yeah i walked back to my hotel to get it. Remember bring passport with you if you are on a shopping spree in Seoul
18,5.0,"This is the place for people like me....shopholic with a style. You can get lots of branded goods at a good price especially at their duty free floors. However, take note that you can only collect the items purchased at the airport upon your departure date. It's really worth it...I got myself a Longchamp handbag, Salvatore Ferragamo belt and high end perfumes here. Lucky for me that we discovered this place only on our last day in Seoul....if not, I would have bought the whole mall....hahaha^_^"
19,5.0,I love how each and every floor level were designated to a specific age and gender but what I loved the most is the duty free floors and the basement where you can find a huge gourmet stores and a handful of restaurants serving a world wide cuisines selections.
20,4.0,Food court is really lovely in Sinsegae. Of course there are a lot of tourist but in general the design of this department store is quite well-planned. Food court you can buy a lot of different thing and makes me feel like a smaller version of Harrods with wider alley.
21,4.0,"This is a huge departmental store. The food basement is huge, offers more high end/ expensive products than Lotte mart. There were multiple mini restaurants at the basement."
22,4.0,"This is a huge department store with duty free shops in the upper floors. But as expected, not too many staff possess good english speaking skills. Internet is free but there are deadspots. Comfort rooms are clean and looked elegant."
23,4.0,"The food court in basement is excellent and has several mid-upscale options. There is a nice garden on the tenth (11th ?) floor rooftop. Bright, open, and prices are fair. Bring your passport for duty free shipping."
24,4.0,"Whenever I am in Seoul, I will go and visit Shinsegae Department store. I like to shop at their super market and also have meals at their food level. This is because the environment is peasant and food is of quality Service is good.'This time, I saw the beautiful lighting outside its store and took some picture. Recommend to those who does not want to in a compact rush for Duty free shopping.Their Cosmetic level and Clothing level is interesting ( even if you dont intend to buy ) browsing through add some fashion inspiration to you on what are the trends of the working executives in Seoul."
25,1.0,Sorry to say this. Never saw such behaviour to customers such that. I have been to more than 40 countries. My wife choosed 5 leather handbags went to the cashier to pay and they refused letting her pay without the passport. At the same time all customers pays normally. As tourist we never carry passports while shopping majority of tourists leave passports in hotel room right! My wife showed her official identity card. But still the cashier refused a supervisor came to help but still the cashier lady refused! Can any one tell me what thats means at front of all other customers. The other thing non of them speaks a single word in english.
26,5.0,High end shopping lives at the Shinsegae Main department store.  I was impressed at the depth of every high end brand represented at this store.
27,4.0,"If you enjoy capitalism, like you should. This mall in the proximity of the Namdaemun market is something to check out. Layer after layer of consumer goods, lights, glitz, with restaurants at the top of the building. If you like European cars, just stand on the street outside and watch 'em roll on up."
28,4.0,"I’m not sure about the other cities, but in both Seoul and Busan, Shinsegae comes in the form of a multi-level shopping complex selling everything from clothes to homeware to… my focus – food. Lots and lots of food!Read my top tips for getting the most of the Food Hall here (you'll be surprised how much farther your $ can take you if you are aware of these): http://bit.ly/1AxWFh5"
29,4.0,There are 2 levels dedicated to duty free shopping which is packed with people mainly the mainlanders. They are buying everything. Price wise is not that attractive. I probably could get similar price locally.
