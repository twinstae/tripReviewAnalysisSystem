0,5.0,"This is the best hike you can do in Seoul. The hike is mild challenging and it will only take 2-3 hours to complete both ascend and descend. If you’re fit, you can complete it quickly. For me, weighing at 108kg, I managed to reach the top regardless. Bring 1 liter of water and some snacks to enjoy at the top. The entire hike is mostly full of steps so, it’s pretty straightforward. And you can get the best views of Seoul. It’s a rewarding experience, especially for those who seldom hike."
1,5.0,Fantastic hike with stunning views in all directions. There are rest points at a few places. Do not advise if have knee or back problems as can be steep on places. But if get to the top... well worth it.
2,3.0,"The trails are poorly marked. It took us quite a while to find the trail head and even after we got to the trails, we couldn't find out way to the top and.... at one point, we walked into an area that's locked.... I still have no idea how did that happen.  Anyhow, we think we managed to take a couple good shots of Seoul from inwangsan."
3,5.0,"If you adore cities, you need to appreciate them from different angles. Seoul is blessed with an array of small mountains and towers; one has no excuse to see multiple on a trip. I would rate the views from Inwangsan above both Naksan Park and Namsan Tower due to the following:- the sense of achievement upon hitting a summit- being able to see the entirety of Seoul (almost) from one aspect- the fact it hasn't devolved into playground for couplesI went with four friends during a hot afternoon, and the entire hike, from Buam-dong to Dongnnimun took just over 3 hours. Photo-taking did slow us down, but you genuinely should factor that into your calculations. No hiking gear was worn, so don't be put off by the sea of neon colour and clacking of poles flying past - one friend managed the majority of it in sliders, while another was dealing with an infected ingrown toenail!If this is one of your first time to Seoul, get it on your itinerary. If not, you'll probably have regretted not going like I did. So yeah, the perfect hike."
4,5.0,"Coming from Sinchon, this mountain is less than half an hour away by bus. I'm a beginner hiker, hike was relatively easy with a few stops to rest for a bit. Took around 2.5 hours to get to the peak and back, but that really depends on how many stops you take for rest or photography. It's highly guarded, from the mountain the Blue House can be seen. It is not allowed to take photos in that direction."
