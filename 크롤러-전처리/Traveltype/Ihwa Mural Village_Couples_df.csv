0,4.0,"It is an area within a village that is full of art murals.  Can take many photos and enjoy a cup of coffee there.  There are also a few cafes/ restaurants you can choose from, though quite pricey compared to the rest of the restaurants in Seoul.  It is in a neighbourhood that required some stairs/steep walking, so take that into consideration.  Also try to be quiet when visiting =)"
1,4.0,"Be prepared, a bit hectic to walk up the steep hill slope. If you like arts - this is a relax care free place to go. You can look around the murals scattered on the  small houses along the hilly alleys. The small cafes around the area are decorated with individual art tastes. You can take a cup of coffee or beer to enjoy the specific city view from the hill. A fun experience."
2,4.0,"i am glad that i did not miss this in my itinerary. even though the murals are not as many as i expected (one of the main mural of goldfish on the staircases are gone), but i like the walk up the alleys, to experience what i've seen in many korean dramas (houses in the small hilly alleys).the was no signboards/directions from Hyehwa station to go Ihwa Mural Village.. i just used Kakao map. really recommended if you are up for a hike, otherwise, don't try it ^_^"
3,5.0,"I had a good time in Ihwa Village. The place is very cute, u can easily rent some uniform for your photos, and the price is very cheap"
4,2.0,Not a lot to see anymore. I understand that some artworks were painted over. Might have been a mistake to visit Gamcheon Cultural Village first since we couldn't help but compare.
5,4.0,"Ihwa Mural Village (이화동벽화마을) perched at the top of Naksan Park, was once set for demolition as it was seen as a poor and down-trodden neighbourhood.  In 2006 under the “Art in City Project” carried out by The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, murals were painted to revitalize the area. Brightly coloured murals on walls, fences and rooftops were created by 70 artists to transform it into a charming and photogenic village. The Mural Village illustrates the ability of street art and human ties to breathe new life to the city. Many small museums, art centers and cafés have also sprung up to add to the bohemian feel. As one mural-hunt, remember that this is a place where people live and the daily lifestyle of residents should be respected. So, please don't intrude."
6,1.0,"Looking from the past review, we thought there will be more mural paintings to see. But they are all either already faded away or badly painted over. Not worth going at all. Don’t waste your time."
7,3.0,"Was looking forward to the village as had seen some pictures. Sadly the famous stuff like the steps were covered over. It's a bit of a climb to the top and kdrama fans can see Strong Woman Do Bong Soon's house which is apparently a museum but looked like a shop. It's also close to Naksan Park which is worth a look. Though there was some interesting art work, it was nothing special and really uninspiring compared to Gamcheon culture village in Busan (where visitors actually seemed to be welcome). We had some yummy milk ice cream at Milk Gongbang which was a cute little place."
8,4.0,It was my first time visiting this neighbourhood and I was shocked at all the messages doodled in red paint by the residents of the area saying “Please be quiet” and “I wan’t to live” etcetc. It can be seen that the residents hate to see tourists there for obvious reasons. Read on blogs that some murals were removed by the residents there as they could not take it anymore and witnessed some being covered by paint.If you’re looking to go to this place just remember to be respectful. The place is located about 1km away from DDM and is on a hill - some routes are very very steep slopes so be careful. You can walk to Naksan Park as well since they are side by side.
9,3.0,We went to see the Ihwa Mural village to see the more known wall paintings. Apparently local people had painted over the the better known painting of fishes at the staircase. This was a bit of disappointment. The rest is so-so but you can enjoy a drink at some of the roof terraces to get a good view.
10,3.0,There is alot of stairs to go up if you want to reach the village.Most of the murals needs a bit of restoration. But it was worth it to walk up to the village to take the pictures with the murals.Would recommend it for couples or close friends.Or k-drama lovers.
11,5.0,"The area is cozy. Wall paints can be found in the whole area. Don't expect too much, it is not designed for tourists; people do live there. That's the reasons they removed the famous painting on one of the staircases.A side note, there is a ice cream store, called ""Milk GongBang"". The milk ice cream there is excellent!"
12,1.0,"The visit was dissapointing because best murals, which were on stairs, are no longer available. There are much better places to see in Seoul."
13,5.0,"A little bit far from the center of Seoul. But this place is definitely good. I was really impressed by Korean traditional atmosphere. And there're many people who enjoy wearing Korean traditional attire. Architecture, people, local restaurant, many things are so attractive here."
14,5.0,"It was so cold in Seoul when we visited but this place warmed up our hearts. Inspiring and uplifting Ihwa Mural Village to walk, take photos, enjoy the views."
15,3.0,"We visited today and it was enjoyable but... they repainted their two special ""mural attractions"" which are the fishes and the floral ceramic design .. for ""rebuilding"" but totally could repair their stairs (which aren't broken) without wasting it all. We were a bit upset since we saw the photos beforehand and were really excited. Otherwise nice for a early morning walk without too many selfie takers so you get nice shots. Also very walkable distance to bukchon traditional village, couldn't find walking time and distance on google maps but seriously is 30 mins and good way to explore the community."
16,4.0,"Extremely hot, tons of stairs, high slopes to climb, not recommended for elderly, but worth the pictures for memories!"
17,3.0,"This area is getting popular but I was not that impressed. The view of Seoul from here and the small houses on steep hillsides impressed me more than the murals themselves. Murals are often hard to find, more signs are needed."
18,4.0,"Some of the Murals are pretty good, however be prepared to walk if you would like to see all the Murals."
19,4.0,Fun place with lots of fun art and cafes/shops to look in. Be prepared to walk up some stairs/small hill to get to the area. If you go on the weekend especially during warmer months expect a lot of crowds. If you want to go with less people it's better to go early or during the week. You can also access parts of the Seoul fortress trail from here. Fun place to visit at least once while in Seoul.
20,4.0,"We left our taxi too early and resulted another 15 minutes walk to the site.  Prepared for long walk and stairs climbing.  Agreed with other reviewers, go there early if you do not want to take good photos and not to be disturbed.  You will find beautiful and colourful paintings in this lovely neighbourhood.  Be cooperative to lower your voices in order not to disturb the house owners' life."
21,4.0,"We visited this ""village"" on a weekday (morning) as we were told that this place is a bit crowded during the weekends.  The ""village"" is located on top of a hill and the road leading to this place is a bit narrow and steep at certain points. Therefore a good pair of walking shoes is recommended. There are ample opportunities to take photographs of the murals and sculptures around the ""village"", therefore it is better to go with a partner. We enjoyed the walk from the metro station to the village and it was lovely with autumn leaves on the trees and road."
22,4.0,"An interesting place to wander around when walking the Seoul  city wall.  We walked along the wall from Dongdaemun and came across this neighbourhood. You can wander around and see some little art studios with artisans at work as well as the murals here and there. It is a good place to stop for a coffee and admire the view down the hill.  You can wander down to the adjacent park or see the old school for underprivileged students, where you can see locals renting the old uniforms and walking around in them! A great place for people watching also."
23,4.0,Went there 5 years ago and wanted to go back again to take a photo with the exact same painting to see how much I have changed. I did not expect to be pleasantly surprised with more new paintings. It's relatively easy to navigate there as there are signs all around. Has become more touristy than the last time I went there. But it's still a beautiful place to check out. We then went for a walk at Naksan park after which has great view of the city btw. Spent about 2 hours there. Advisable to go early in the morning as it can get really hot in the afternoon.
24,4.0,"I love Seoul for so many reasons. It is diverse you never know what to expect: a mountain, a temple, a tower, a nightlife district, an old palace, a mountain... That is once again the case with Ihwa Mural Village. I kind of stumbled upon it while intending to visit Naksan Park. The village features lots of small and cosy houses full of coffee houses and shops and little art exhibitions... But the main reason why this place is famous is the multitude of murals. The neighborhood is full of murals (some are actually found on steps of stairs or on the ground, rather than on actual walls). The murals themselves are - for most of them - not overly impressive artistically, but what makes the place interesting is that you'll never know what you'll encounter next. Located on the side of a hill, Ihwa is full of small streets, slanted alleyways, sloped roads, which allows for all the murals to be approached from a different perspective, with a different background, and different ways to experience the wall paintings. Walking around a street and randomly encountering a new mural in an unexpected manner is truly an enjoyable experience."
