0,5.0,Great show. Everything was time and in great location. Performer's engagement with audience was fun! My advise is to get seats around 4th to 5th row from the front to have a better angle of the stage.
1,3.0,Perhaps due to the many positive reviews and raves about the show we went with high expectations. No doubt the energy is high and the actors were engaging but it was hard to catch the storyline and as Korean was used it would have been good to have translations to better understand and follow along. Good thing we got discounted tickets  USD56 for 2 persons. If you have the money to spare do go otherwise give it a miss. We definitely did not see flying knives only lots of chopping of vegetables.
2,5.0,My husband and I went to see NANTA years ago when we lived in Seoul. I took my son (age 16) last week and he also enjoyed it.  I recommend this show to both locals and foreign travelers.
3,5.0,"I had read up reviews and decided that i must go for this show for my first visit in Korea. Sure enough I was laughing with tears. The actors are so funny, experienced and engaging, there were also audience participation. The show was really entertaining. You do not need to know Korean language to understand, as even my 3 years old and 5 years old were laughing non stop, even we are now back in Singapore, my children can still remembered the session and shared with me.I would say is a MUST WATCH SHOW in Seoul, not to be missed if you are in Seoul."
4,5.0,"We enjoyed this show would recommend very funny and entertaining - our children are 7, 10 & 12 they all enjoyed it - a good laugh!"
