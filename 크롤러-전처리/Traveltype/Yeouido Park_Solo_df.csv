Best for walking, jogging, cycling, basketball or just sitting enjoying the surrounds.  Lots of amenities available.  Underpass links to Hangang Park at North East end."

3,5.0,"My second time actually visiting Yeouido but it feels like the first time because last time was autumn. I went there alone so I didnt rent a tent, ordered a chicken so I guess I missed something big but at least I got to observe how they celebrate Spring Festival. And the cherry blossoms are just as lovely as the people."
4,4.0,"Do pop by if you are nearby, otherwise I don't think it's worth it to come here. Went when cherry blossoms were in bloom, but there are many other places to view cherry blossoms as well. Overall a nice place for a stroll but only if you are nearby."
5,5.0,"This park and area are famous within the locals and tourist. Especially when I came here during cherry blossom season, better to come early to enjoy cherry blossom. This area is quite large. Can enjoy the city view, hangang river, nice weather, and picnics with your friends. I walk more further from Yeouido Hangang Park to see cherry blossom and i found the area that is really beautiful and enjoyable. Also there are some street food stall near the park. I love to spend some time here to relaxing my soul. And I think, during sunset time will be nice too even we can't see the sunset from this park."

9,5.0,"if you live nearby this park in cherry blossom season then do not skip this place.  it was really beautiful visit during March/April this year (2018).  enjoyed the beautiful trees. it looks more beautiful in nature than it look in pictures. no much things to do. just for walking and relaxing with family.  there is a small market for quick bite.  also, there is a huge open yard for playing around.  also, there is a street nearby full of cherry blossom trees.  i loved it during this season.  other seasons i am not sure how it looks."
10,4.0,"I swear by Yeouido Park because it has .. LAWNS!! These are very rare in central Seoul, but at Yeouido Park you can spread out a blanket and have a picnic in several spots. Even more, you can ride a bike along the shady perimeter circular route (or walk/jog if that's your thing). It's squeaky clean, has lots of big old trees for shade, and miraculously keeps out most of the car noise from the outside world. Once you get in to this rectangular little oasis, you really get refreshed."

There are many things to see in this park, including hundreds of cherry trees in the park, as well as on the streets circling the park.Even if we missed the Spring Flower Festival (being deferred to later days) when we were there in the first week of April, we enjoyed our walk around the park.

13,4.0,We were there for the Spring Flower Festival.  It's quite crowded and there're performance on the street.Walking along the park with this beautiful scene is very relaxing. We aligned at National Assembly Station and took a short walk to the park.

15,5.0,"4 subway stations are around Yeouido-dong.  More restaurants, cafe can be found at the road side ""Gukhoe-daero 68/70-gil"" near the National Assembly station.  The atmosphere on weekdays and weekend are different.  But restaurants many closed on Sunday.Travel around early to mid-April is the best Cherry Blossom season at Seoul.  Yeouido Park is one of the most popular destinations for viewing cherry blossoms.  Recommended to travel during the cherry blossom festival at night time."
16,4.0,"Nice park, large playground at central Plaza then followed by a nice stroll along lush of greens and trees, also flowers. You don't feel your are in the city center."
17,5.0,"Lucky me when come here in 1st week of April 2018 when all the street corner is full of cherry blossom and there is a cherry blossom festival in the park, to get here bu subway you can pick line 5 (purple line subway) and stop at the Yeouinaru station (527) subway...there are some streetfood corner if you are hungry after taking a walk and you can also have a dinner or lunch at the cruise near the river at Yeouido park"

22,4.0,Long scenic bike ride near the lake. Lots of space for walking too. Numerous rest stops. Can get good views of the rivers and bridges. Loved this area.
23,5.0,"Not just my favorite park in Seoul, but my all time favorite.  Better than Golden Gate Park in San Francisco (though it is much bigger).  And New York Central Park can't even compare.  I say this mainly because this park is keep very clean and in great condition.  Lots of beautiful views and connecting to Han Park as well.April is the best time because of the cheery blossom trees blooming.  The last time we were here, it was April, but really crowded because everyone else wants to come see the beautiful views.  It is also a time of year when it is not hot and humid.There are places along the way where you can buy some drinks and snacks, and you will see many people on rented bicycles.  Some locals bring their bikes.  We have never seemed to have trouble parking.  There is a fee in most areas at the park, but I consider it cheap.Just plain to spend a whole day there and have a picnic."
24,5.0,"My daughters and I rented bikes on a cool Autumn morning, just as the leaved started changing. 9000 won for 3 bikes for an hour (tandem bikes are also available). It was money well spent! It was so lovely to bike around the park! The bike track is flat and suitable for all levels. It was so peaceful and relaxing. You could stop along the way and take in some of the gorgeous scenery. There are also 2 little cafes in the park if you feel like a snack. Highly recommended!Just note that to rent bikes you will need to present one piece of ID (e.g. passport)."
25,4.0,"Most Koreans seem to come here to set-up their tents and to enjoy their loved ones, which is an interesting happening to watch in itself. However, I chose to make a small bike ride circling the island. Lots of stuff to see underway and nice break-away from the busy city life!"
26,5.0,it was so packed when i went here at Spring season.even though is not holiday but even the local people gather in here.Bloom everywhere!!! (human and flower)
27,5.0,"We specifically chose to visit Korea in the spring so we could catch the famous cherry blossoms in their full splendor, a decision that paid amazing dividends. With our son and daughter-in-law living in Korea, we were fortunate to have the best guides show us the best things Korea has to offer. We made it a whole day event, and luckily, we had the best weather for a long and pleasant walk through the park. The welcoming scenery was incredible! We've seen Washington DC during the cherry blossom season, and although it is a experience to cherish, Yeouido Park will by far always be second to none. What a magnificent site! We got there during the peak time and every tree and every bush was covered in blossoms. Pinks galore, whites and other colors were a true feast for our eyes. We chose to get a map, which you can pick up at the entrance, so we could find our way around. It was so wonderful to see how Koreans truly make use of such a stunning facility, we saw hundreds of local residents in sports attire taking to the numerous trails around the park. They obviously love to hike and enjoy the outdoor, and th. Are with which park official manage the park ought to be applauded. The park is very clean, it's kept in the most amazing condition, there are all kind of facilities throughout, clean restrooms in multiple spots, and even food stands to pick up light snacks. This was truly a wonderful day and the experience will last a life time. Beautiful park! We went in April, so be sure to take a light jacket or sweater, temperature can change rather quickly, so be pr pared. There are excellent sidewalks and flat parkways for parents pushing strollers, this is a great choice for families to visit. The park is huge!"
28,4.0,"This is a big park with many options within and around. You can rent a bike or inline skates to ride around, or just stroll around. There are nice restaurants next to the KBS building, or across the big road in IFC and around. You can buy snacks and beverages inside the park too.The park is linked to Han River park, and it is also a great park with even wider options. You can do water sports, ride a sightseeing ship, play at a shallow water fountain. Great for young kids."
29,3.0,"we had gone to Yeouido park to see the Cherry blossoms.  we were slightly disappointed , there were far too many people on the street where the cherry blossoms were. The street was also a main road. Every picture i took of the cherry blossoms  had  50 other people in it.     there was unfortunately also too  many street stalls on the road side which detracted from any beautiful shot of the cherry blossoms. . if you want cherry blossoms, then do the homework again or go to the Busan Jinhae cherry blossoms festival. its better there. one location has a small stream surrounded by cherry blossoms on both banks.  or go to the unused railway station to see cherry blossom trees on both sides .  by the way cherry blossoms only flower for a week. come too early and you see a few, come too late and you see no cherry blossoms. here is a tip , look up the ' korea cherry blossom forecast ' published from February to early march. Yeouido park though is a lovely open space to have a picnic and see the river. or to catch a river cruise up the Han river."
30,5.0,this place is mostly famous for its cherry blossoms. if you visit this place in the beginning to spring you will be able to see the beautiful cherry blossoms tree and it is just amazing.
31,5.0,The park has four distinct areas. Some lovely trees and shrubs. Missed tge cherry blossom sadly. A good place to people watch Korean families enjoying a day out. Watch out for the very dramatic sculpture.
32,5.0,"We went here as a family during the cherry blossom season and the views/photos were spectacular.  This is reasonably close to the Han River and the ""I Seoul You"" sign.  Enjoy!"
33,4.0,We were lucky to go here and witness the full bloom of Cherry Blossom Trees.  There are rows and rows of cherry trees in this area but a bit tricky if you will go there for a cherry blossom viewing as the blooming of the trees last only 10 days a year.  Go here in the morning as beginning lunchtime - lots of people are in the street / park.
34,4.0,"Depending on what you are looking for. This park is for many things or activities. Walking, running, cycling & other activities. It is along the Han River and surrounding the Parliament House.Try to go to the park in the early morning or evening. If intend to take photo of the cherry blossom, then it is best early morning with a quiet walking path without people to have a nice shooting."
35,4.0,"Went here after being so excited about cherry blossoms.  As many people know these flowers only bloom 2 weeks within a year and many celebrate as they are gorgeous. Korean loves their cherry blossom, not as much as Japanese do, but the trend is increasing.  In this park, do find the atrium and there will be many families, couples, friends playing here. From bicycle, rollers to scooters. You can rent easily but not for very small children. During the festival there are many food stalls and activities, so within these 2 weeks you'll get culture, happenings trends and current local favorites.  Since the event is outdoor do prepare umbrella as early April (when the flowers bloom) means there's rain every now and then and the temperature is still chilly. Best to visit anytime of the day but we do love afternoon as somehow it was more romantic."
36,5.0,yes we love the night lights of the trees with the cool weather and safe to walk by ourselves or by group
37,3.0,"when i gone here it was sunday and the spring festival was going on that day, that might be the reason why there is people packed around the park and beside the river. i get there by subway and it seem like all off the passengers was going to the this place...really2 crowded with people cycling, families were picnic in the park, children playing kites, couples walking around or just enjoying the breeze (its still windy and pretty cold), group of teens taking selca, ahjumma selling things.if you prefer place that not too crowded, i recommend you to go there at weekdays. the cherry blossom was not as many as at jinhae / yonggungsa too..."
38,5.0,"A beautiful park in the middle of the city. I visited Yeouido Park in spring 2017. There were beautiful cherry blossoms everywhere. You can go for walks, rent a bike or skate through the park. My husband and I rented a tandem bike and we found that it's the best way to get around the park. We managed to cover the entire park in a short time and it was not tiring either. The park facilities were also very good - there were a lot of public toilets around the area. You may also find the King Sejong statue at this park."
39,5.0,This is best to go to during Sakura/Cherry Blossom season because there was nothing much to see after that.
40,4.0,"We walked the area to view blossoming trees but the week we were there only a few trees were in bloom.  The blossoms came out the week after we were there.  The trees in bloom were beautiful, as well as many other flowering bushes."
41,5.0,"i love this place too.Very nice organised park.We rented a bicycle and cycle around the park.But on my visiting day, the flower has not fully bloom.......:("
42,4.0,Went to this park on 3rd April with hopes to see cherry blossoms however only a handful of trees have bloomed. There were pretty flowers around and a nice small playground. A nice park for a stroll.
43,5.0,"We been here in March it was so nice and so many international tourists and domestic, nice whether and feel loving all tree around. There is no entrance fee and well management, must visit"
44,4.0,"For a winters day the park was quite lively, probably because if the ice skating that had been setup. Lots of families around and people walking the park circuit."
45,4.0,"On its own island on the Han River, the train ride from Seoul Central was less than 20 minutes for you to enjoy outdoor skating and sled. Great for kids to let go steam in the middle of winter"
46,5.0,We were lucky to have visited the park when the cherry blossoms are still in bloom. It was not as crowded as I have expected because it was early and a weekday probably. It's a nice place to walk around or stay for an afternoon picnic with your friends/family.
47,4.0,"I was staying in the area, and it was a very nice park in the late autumn, great fall colors and quite paths.  Has a jogging track and walking paths, little ponds and grassy knolls.  In the south there's a large paved area with basketball courts and other activities."
48,5.0,"It's a huge park with several entrances, but don't worry, there's a map at every gate, so you always know where you are, or head in which direction if you are looking for a specific place, like the KBS building.There are several benches, and the walking course is made up of a special material - I guess, for runners -, so even if you've been walking all day, your feet won't hurt.It's the perfect place to have lunch or reflect on your experiences during your trip. And indeed, you'll find many people, who work in the surrounding buildings relax in the park.There's also a statue of King Sejong the Great, a replica of the one at Gwanghwamun Square, in the park."
49,5.0,"Yeouido Park is really beautiful in Autumn. the leaves color so beautiful.from Yeouido Station (Seoul subway), exit 3. just walk straight about 5 minutes. then you will meet the intersection, and the Yeouido Park big-white signage across the road. i walk in the morning. its really refreshing."
50,5.0,"Taking the line 5, exit 2 or 3 of the Yeouido Naru Station. You can rent the bike for riding, take a walk or jogging with the great Han River view!! Also, you can buy ticket for the tour boat or cruise (12000 krw)."
51,4.0,"It's a nice, small park. I recommend going here in the spring for a picnic when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom."
52,4.0,"Being right in Yeouido, a major financial district, this park is surprisingly large and spacious.  It does get a bit crowded when the weather is nice and people are on their lunch breaks.  Still, there's lots of open grass, walking paths and other nice distractions like ponds and flowers.  There's playgrounds for small kids, too.  Easy to get to and right across the street is IFC Mall (which can be accessed by tunnels from the subway station).  It's not a highlight of Seoul; it's a place to take a break from the highlights."
53,3.0,"Have a nice walk in the middle of Seoul's business district, you will see anything from traditional korean forrests to lakes, buildings and statues of founding fathers. You can also exted the walk down to the river for a long walk."
54,4.0,"It is where you can the lots cherry blossoms in Seoul. I came here in the second week of the April, so lucky that still have cherry blossom for me. It's the first time to see it. It's so amazing. But I didn't stay long cuz it was so crowded :("
55,5.0,"During spring all the cherry blossom trees bloom so nicely, it takes a hour or two to walk all the way from one side to another, but also keep it mind that during the blooming season there are so many people, it will be hard to move haha. other than that, it is very nice place to visit and take pictures. On the way there is also some big broadcasting stations, so if you like korean dramas and tv shows, you can take a look around :)"
56,5.0,"Although not too much areas where you can find some shade, the park along Han river is an excellent place to cool off. We liked the swimming areas a lot. Not deep, so safe for the children, but still fun walking   down the stream and wading in the pool was fun. The park is big. Bike rental is a good option to explore the entire area."
57,4.0,"About:It's a large recreational area located on an island known as Yeouido Island in central part of Seoul and easy access by subway Line no 5. Things to do here:Many cultural events are held here and many outdoor activities to do like bicycling, roller skating and play other sports and that includes for children too. Only Korean traditional trees are planted here and has a Nature Ecosystem Forest. This place is famous for having the loveliest cherry blossom street in Seoul and is a must see. Tips:Hire a bicycle; circle around the park first  and then go to Yeouido Hangang Park on it as it's very big and u can Njoy the ride along the river. Best time to go around 3 to 4 pm so you can see both parks at one time and sunset is beautiful over the river."
58,5.0,This is a very nice park with great views! Great nature feel in the city. The Cherry Blossoms are very pretty.
59,5.0,"It's the closest park to my hotel so it becomes my regular morning stroll place. Surprisingly it's quite nice with good trail, views, pond, a Korean garden, food massage stone trail, etc. All of us enjoy so much here."

62,5.0,"We went there in the early morning that cherry blossom was all over everywhere. Not much people in the park! we walked along and enjoy the sunshine with those pretty flowers. If you plan to visit Korea in April, Yeouido definitely is one place must go!"

64,4.0,"Took a stroll early on a Sunday morning and enjoyed the park thoroughly.  I can see it gets really crowded during peak times on weekends but when I went it was very peaceful.  Nice grounds, well marked pathways, running and biking trails and areas for food booths, sports etc.  I visited just after the peak cherry blossom season, but still was a great place to escape the frenzy of the big city for a while."
65,5.0,The whole park was filled with gorgeous cherry blossoms! So glad we managed to see them in Seoul without having to travel outskirts.The park gets pretty crowded though.
66,5.0,Yeouido Ecology Park is great for early Cherry Blossom Observation! The way started from JW Marriott and expand to like 2 miles.
67,4.0,"The park is a short walk from the station and I went close to the lunch hour, which proved to be a smart idea as the crowd guided me to the park. Despite being full of people, the park was spacious and well-planned to accommodate the people. Even though bike lanes and people-lanes were separate, people spilled over into all the lanes. Bikes can also go into the park lanes instead of riding around the outer rim. The bike rental store is clearly marked on the park map and the rates were affordable (3000 won for an hour for single bike riders). Bring an article of identity when renting the bike, as the bike store guy will ask for your passport to rent the bike.The park is also close to a section of Hangang park, so you can knock out two parks in one trip."
68,4.0,Korea is famous for the cherry blossoms between late April and May if you want to see the cherry blossoms this park is the best place to view them. The park is also very large and very accessible by the subway it's close to the Han River and there are restaurants nearby it's a great place to stroll on an afternoon either with family or by yourself. You can also rollerblade skateboard and you can rent bicycles.
69,4.0,"Our family walked the promenade along the Han River during the April cherry blossom festival.  IT was something to see with the canopy of cherry blossoms that are beautiful as anywhere in the world.  But beware, it is extremely crowded since everyone else in Seoul seems to decide to walk under the cherry blossoms on the same weekend."
70,5.0,There are not enough green spaces in Seoul. This was the best I found. A good sized park. Beautiful in autumn sunshine. I will visit this place again for sure
71,3.0,"During our visit, the cherry blossom trees were only starting to bloom. It made for a good walk though."
72,5.0,"Yeouido park is a great way to escape the busy world in Seoul. Many times you may feel as though life is going too fast in the city. A trip to Yeouido park is a great way to take a break from that world. You can relax and enjoy nature. This park is particularly beautiful in early spring and on a rainy day in November, (bring an umbrella on that day)."
73,5.0,This park is excellent for 30min or 1hour walk. The view is no nice especially at spring and autumn. There are many benches to relax and you can buy drinks and snacks at reasonable price.

77,4.0,I was a week late and completely missed the cherry blossoms lol.  Still a great park.  I almost fell asleep here after lunch because I was so relaxed lol.  If I saw the cherry blossoms I'm sure my rating for this place would be 5 out of 5.
78,3.0,It is a nice park with a great view of Seoul. We also did a cruise on the Han river. It didn't cover too much but it was a fun activity on our way to the 63 building.
79,5.0,"There are two parks with similar names - but this one, Yeouido Park isn't the one facing Hangang. I missed the cherry blossoms by a week or two unfortunately, but the park is still beautiful! Families were having picnics, cycling and going for a walk when I was there. The park is big and the different parts each has different themes. Besides the well kept and clean garden, there are basketball courts and huge area to play skateboards, cycling etc. A must-go indeed and go for a walk/cycling and what have you, just as how the Seoulites do :) Go for a long walk or rent a bike, this park is worth a visit! (you can reach the park from either Yeouido /Yeouinaru Stations)"
80,3.0,"Our first stop for Cherry Blossom in Seoul, but, we found the road behind the National Assembly to be better. It was a long walk from Yeouido Park to National Assembly but well worth it."
81,5.0,"The  trees  are blossoming  and the chance  for great  photos  are abundant. The  trees  surrounded  the buildings and officials  provided  lots of portable  rest rooms. Parking  can be found  but it is tight. Get there  early, beat the  crowds. If possible  bring  your  own  drinks  and  snacks. All in all  if you like flowering  trees  and other  floral  displays  you   will  not  be  disappointed."
82,4.0,We went to Yeouido Park during the cherry blossoms season and park was beautiful with trees lined on either side.Locals and tourists delighted in the festivities and there were street performers who mad the entire experience an enjoyable one...
83,4.0,"Went there this morning on a Sunday. Today April 5, the full bloom of the cherry blossoms has been delayed by mother nature probably due to climate change. Still, those along the road surrounding the National Assembly had a few hundred already in semi-bloom so still was worth the trip. I could just imagine when it is in full bloom a few weeks from now. Wish I was still here in Korea to see it. I don't get to see these where i come from. The park itself is a very relaxing place and the best part for me is i got to smell the scent of pine trees again! Last time i got to breath in these scent was literally decades ago! What a beautiful smell it was this morning! Totally refreshing! If you have the time to spare after you get tired of shopping and going to various tourist sites in Korea, i would suggest a visit here. Very easy to get to. Just as it is described by my fellow trip advisors. It is definitely an oasis in a city!"
84,3.0,"Yeouido park is located in the center of the city and it is one of the few parks in SeoulIt's a quite sad place in my opinion. But korean people like it, especially in the springtime when this park can be VERY crowded of people making photo at those sad cherry blossom trees"
85,5.0,I missed Seoul Spring Festival by a week but I still had fun spotting cherry blossoms and other spring flowers in bloom from the National Assembly building to Yeouido Park.Yeouido Park has a very good therapeutic walkway and a bike lane.
86,4.0,"The huge recreational park is divided into sections with themes - a traditional Korean area with trees and gardens, grassy hill, cultural square and a 'nature's ecosystem' forest. Some call it the 'Central Park (New York)' or 'Hyde Park (Sydney)' of Seoul. Many locals rent bikes to ride around or just play games like Basketball. During Spring, the area livens up with the beautiful Cherry Blossoms."

90,5.0,"I just visited Yeouido Park (behind National Assembly Building) on 19 April (Friday) & all the trees were in full bloom! I read that last year the cherry blossoms also peaked on 19 April. My family & I were so ecstatic as the view is magnificent! Very romantic, but it is very nice for family outing too. I know that cherry blossoms don't last long so I think we were really lucky. Not only in this park, but the cherry trees in other part of Seoul were in full bloom too! This was my first time seeing so many cherry trees in full bloom, so yes this is such a precious & sweet experience. There were some stalls selling all kind of snacks on the street too. Come on weekdays, as weekends will be too crowded.But we missed the Cherry Blossom Festival by 1 day, which lasted from 12-18 April 2013. During this festival, you can expect to see many street or cultural performances, and flower exhibitions."
91,4.0,"Visiting Yeouido Park was the highlight of our holiday in Seoul. The cherry blossoms were the reason why we came in April during spring time. We have heard that it’s not easy to predict when the cherries will bloom. But on this day, the 19th of April 2013, we came, and saw with our own eyes what we had only previously seen in pictures. We were told that the cherries started blooming 5 days before we came. To see the cherries still blooming when we were there, was a lucky day for us. Indeed, we actually saw the black and white magpies a few times at Yeouido, which are known in Korea as the bird that brings good luck. We started our tour of Yeouido Park from Yeouinaru Station at 9 am. It was cool and sunny, and a great day for a stroll. We admired the pink canopy of sakuras all the way to the National Assembly. There are many sakura trees in Seoul, but here in Yeouido Park, there must have been a thousand. We felt like we could walk forever, strolling tirelessly with the Han River flanking on one side and the commercial Seoul skyline on the other. Words just cannot describe how wonderful and serene we felt. We love the weather, the trees, the crowd, the couples, the school children, the performers and the stall vendors. It was marvelous when an unknown group of locals wanted to immersed themselves with us in a group photo. If there is paradise on earth, we may have got a glimpse of it right here in Yeouido Park."

I saw the Cherry Blossoms in full bloom , and the one can never get tired of walking under the lovely white snow-like canopy of blossoms ! Truly , a memorable park walk in my life , It may have been too cold for spring, but the sight of the blooms will warm you up ;)"
