0,5.0,"Amazing building, really worth the visit and spending some time to soak it all in!Super easy to access via the subway system and conveniently located, this is a must visit!"
1,5.0,"One thing I hate about Seoul is how bloody difficult it can be to cross the street. You can't really get close to the gate because of how the gates are set up, so don't feel bad if none of your pics turn out right. After some shopping at the nearby namdaemun market, you can come here for some shots. There's several of these bad boys around Seoul, so go catch em all."
2,3.0,"Interesting gate, but not as accessible or explained as well as the Sungnyemun Gate.  Good for some photos and as a point to start a longer walk to explore the Seoul City Wall, which commences just North of the Dongdaemun Gate and climbs up to Naksan Park."
3,4.0,"Also known as Heunginjimun Gate, it is the largest gate in Seoul. A unique feature is the half-circle shaped wall to protect the gate. In fact, it is the only gate among Seoulâ€™s eight gates to have this wall. For a good photo shoot, suggest you cross the road and climb uphill for about 5 to 10 mins in Dongdaemun Seonggwak Park. I visited during the late afternoon. I suppose evening is a better time to appreciate the buildings with the lighting."
4,4.0,"Looking at the pictures, I should have gone at night. But even during the day the gate looks very impressive."
5,4.0,"The gate is across from the JW Marriott hotel, within walking distance of the Dongdaemun metro.  It's best to view it in the evening as the lights make it shine like a jewel from a distance.  We went in the evening the gate was closed.  Not sure if it opens during the day, doesn't look like it though."
6,4.0,"Got to check out Dongdaemun gate during the day. The area is good to explore. At night, it is lit up nicely."
7,4.0,"However, apart from being an important monument, the Dongdaemun Gate is also an integral part of today's city. It is lively and vibrant in the context of the modern City and bustles with life."
8,3.0,Historic gate. Close to markets. Seems to be fenced off. Part of the old wall is here. Can walk along the wall
9,3.0,"Right across the street from the JW Marriott, this gate is worth seeing but nothing else to commend it in the area."
10,4.0,Nice Historical site of the old kingdom. There is a huge shopping area featuring 24hrs wholesale nearby. Tons of resturants and cafe nearby.
11,5.0,I really love this place and I think all people that visit Seoul should come here at least once. It is full of history and for people to be able to understand Seoul and Korea is this really an important place.
12,3.0,This is not something you are required to do if time is limited however it is a nice walk around the area and you can see the ongoing construction where modern architecture meets the ancient.
13,3.0,"The structure looks grand and imposing, although it is still undergoing renovations at my last visit in early April 2017. Suggest to take a short walk along the old city walls at night. From here, you can get a nice view of the gate plus all the modern buildings surrounding the gate. A structure of historical significance. There is a museum in the vicinity as well (2 min walk away from the gate), although I did not get to visit it as it was closed at night."
14,3.0,"National treasure~ this gate is one of the eight gates surrounding Seoul City Wall. The fortress walls around the gate were destroyed long ago, bu the gate remains the same as it was in Joseon period. It is definitely one of the top tourist attraction spot. There are many shopping places near the gate too!"
15,4.0,"With a big stone base underneath, this two-storied gate (direction-wise, it's the East Gate) is the ""biggest"" of Seoul's six gates of which I got to three with Sungnyemun (the South Gate, a big gate also with two stories and just slightly smaller than this one, near Seoul Station) and the Southeast Gate (a ""considerably smaller"" gate just about a 10-minute walk south from this gate) being the other two besides this one; didn't get to the three in the north (the North Gate, the Northeast Gate & the Northwest Gate), but I'm quite sure those are just small ones nothing on the scale of this one & Sungnyemun (the South Gate).  The Gate is only to view from outside (cannot go inside the archway through the stone base or go up on the stairs to above), but just its ""imposing structure"" definitely makes it ""stand out"" in the area which is fairly wide-open (the Gate is not clustered around by buildings, and actually just across the street from it on one side is a grassy high ground with a stretch of the city wall over it and a beautiful small church on the other side of that wall - a ""pretty serene"" scene really in the middle of the city).  And shortly after 8 pm, it's an ""illuminated view"" of the Gate that you'll see (the lower story turns ""golden"").Coming by subway, Dongdaemun Station (on Lines 1 & 4) is the nearest one, but what I would actually like to suggest (for ""a lot more fun"") is to get off at Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station (on Lines 2, 4 & 5) where you'll be at a ""very lively"" area with big department stores (such as Lotte & Doota), the interesting-shaped Dongdaemun Design Plaza with the History & Culture Park on the other side and a lovely night market with mobile kiosks spread out here & there on the sidewalk along one side of the big Jangchungdan-ro street along which just about a 10-minute walk north (be sure to walk through that lovely night market) will bring you to the popular Cheonggyecheon Stream (below the ground level but also great to just look at from above) and just across that stream (so just on the north side of the stream) is this magnificent gate."
16,4.0,"Currently being renovated, but the sign on the outside says it will be completed in April 2017. Good views of the gate when walking from the City wall."
17,4.0,"Dongdaemun means east gate that is one of main four gates in seoul. People used to pass this gate to go to the capital in Chosun Period. It's close to tour the dongdaemun design Plaza, dongdaemun market and dongdaemun history & culture museum from the dongdaemun gate."
18,4.0,"Historical and inspirational gate, best of all, it sits in the middle of Seoul's hyper shopping heaven area. Take a break, take a look at the historical gate, especially at night has its own charm."
19,4.0,This is a massive gate that was built in 1398 by King TejeoIts best viewed at night due to the lighting its walking distance from Myeongdong Best for history lovers
20,4.0,"Reasonably priced. The two restaurants offering hotpots(1'30"") and buffets(1'40"") are flexible for those who opt for less spicy food. Outback there serves Korean style dishes, interesting!"
21,3.0,Passing by Dongdaemun Gate every day when I was in Seoul.  Seoul was a walled city long long time ago and there are pieces of historical evidence passed down to the present day.
22,5.0,If you want to walk and see the Seoul Fortress and Wall - and their gates need to be planned out in advance if you are here for only a short holiday.  This gate is impressive and most impressive when you make it part of an adventure walking the wall.  The wall is long and massive.  So it will take some days.  This gate is cool because it sits in the middle of chaos and close to modern Seoul.
23,2.0,"It was a part of great wall, but most of them were torn down in the past. And this gate was burned few years ago, so it is not authentic version. You don't need to drop by this place at all. Just take a shot while you are passing by."
24,3.0,On the corner of a heavy traffic area..4AM visit was more peaceful for a short outside walk to decompress after 14 flight from USA. Park is nice
25,3.0,"Quite similar to Namdaemun (southern gate of Seoul), this gate is a nice piece of Korean traditional architecture. It was used as a checkpoint in the past when the city walls were still existent but nowadays it looks like a memorial. Nice for taking a few photos, when visiting the Dongdaemun market."
26,4.0,"This gate is also known as Heunginjimun is one of the 8 gates of old Seoul - its actually quite beautiful sitting there all alone in the middle of the road no longer important as it used to be!There are a lot of shops around the place so it would be good to add this in when exploring other areas, if you walk further up you will find some parts of the old Seoul wall and you can take a walk along the wall and get beautiful views of the city from the top"
27,3.0,"More correctly known as Heunginjimun - the 'Eastern Gate' dates was originally established in the 14th Century. The current structure is said to have been built in 1869. Unlike Sungnyemun (near Namdaemun Markets) you could not walk through the gate, only admire its beauty from across the road. The more interesting attraction is the Dongdaemun Markets and Shopping Complex just adjacent to the gate."
28,3.0,this area was pretty crazy with people. lots of department store buildings. i only enjoyed two which was the doota and the new lotte fitin. i was not willing to check out cheap stores and try to negotiate prices or something like that. it was pretty cool but good to just go once.
29,4.0,The Gate itself is called the East Gate but it does seem out of place since the roads pretty much cut right beside it.The area however is a big shopping area with malls above and below ground there is also a shoe market right beside the gate.
