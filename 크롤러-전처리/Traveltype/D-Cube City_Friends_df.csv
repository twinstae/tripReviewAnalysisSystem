1,5.0,Very modern and trendy with lots of shops and fantastic food court with live cooking. We chose the running sushi and it was great!
2,4.0,"I would say this place has the best shopping in Seoul. With HnM, Stradivarius, Zara and more. There's not too much in the way of men's fashion here though. NBot too many choices as far as dining goes, sadly, but there's enough. n"
3,5.0,"We stayed at the Sheraton D-Cube City and had a wonderful stay.  The hotel is upside down with the lobby at the 41st floor and the hotel rooms were the 28th floor to the 40th floor.  All rooms had incredible views of the city.  The rooms were very modern and very clean.  Our room had two double beds (we were three adults) and the bathroom had its own steam room shower.  Of course flat screen tv and a built in safe for your valuables.  The wait for the elevators was just seconds and there is a gym on the 28th floor with a golf driving range (electronic) and a swimming pool.  The dining room is on the 41th floor and very expensive (breakfast is a buffet at $33/per person US)  Wifi cost extra but is free if you connect in the lobby.  All of the people who worked the front desk were courteous and very helpful.  I would give this hotel 5 stars on all levels.  In addition, on the lower floors is a 7 story shopping mall and on the two lower floor are wonderful restaurants serving all kinds of Asian foods (not just Korean).  they even had a wine shop and one place made Pizzas.  And the best part is that you can take a bus ($15 each way) directly from the Inchion airport to the hotel.  A cab will cost you about $70-75 and takes about an hour."
