0,5.0,Very accessible from my hotel. Nice to see the week end families enjoying activities. Good atmosphere and plenty of space to rest. Perfect place for fresh air and walk around small lake. Enjoy
1,4.0,"I've seen so many palaces already, that this is the only one I decided to visit during my trip here. The complex is huge. It's nice to walk around. I was a bit dissapointed that the teahouse all the way in the back was under construction. Lots of girls and a few men were dressed in traditional clothing. You can rent those nearby and I read with them, the entrance to palaces is free (this palace is 3000won). Lots of good photo opportunities and especially away from the main palace it was nicer to walk around, less people. Try to see the changing of the guards! It's outside the palace so free. I think 10, 11, 13 and 14."
2,5.0,The Palace is a piece of history in the quiet setting in downtown Seoul. I dressed as a Palace guard in traditional garb.
3,5.0,"Do take the English tours for better understanding and insight on this place, it is a huge Palace with lots of beautiful picture spots. Visit the Folks Museum and Palace Museum so you get a holistic view of Korean past."
4,5.0,Beautiful and historic spot in central Seoul. A must visit if you visit South Korea. Make sure to catch the guard change too!
5,5.0,This is a must see place if visiting Seoul. Could have spent a whole day there were it not for limited time. Would love to return.
6,4.0,"This is a large expansive complex that really requires at least three hours to experience.  And with the ridiculously cheap admission rates, you will definitely get your money's worth.  A lot of people (locals and tourists alike) enjoy renting traditional Korean clothes (hanbuk) and often mill around throughout.  Photos are accepted; just politely ask first.  It really is a 5 star attraction; I am just not into this type of thing and would rather spend my time in a local neighbourhood hanging out which is why I gave it 4 stars."
7,3.0,I went to the palace on a whim and it was totally worth it. It’s an awesome experience especially if one visits during the change of guard ceremony. There’s a lot to see at the palace and it offers magnificent photo opportunities. I recommend a visit here for anyone going to Seoul.
8,5.0,"The park is beautiful specially with allThe tourists (mainly Chinese) wearing the hanbok for a traditional look and photos.Don’t miss the changing of the royal guards at the main gate at 10am and 2pm everyday when not raining, except Tuesdays"
9,5.0,"Best scenery and relaxing. The areas of the palace was so big, and there are museum too, I would suggest whole day trip, they closed around 5pm, and entrance fee is just 3000won/adult (Affordable)."
10,4.0,"Walking distance from where you can rent Hanboks is this palace. It is well preserved and provides the best background for your Joseon inspired photoshoot.Since there are many visitors, in regular clothes and in costume, it takes patience and good timing to get that perfect travelling in time, kdrama scene, hanbok shot. But oh so worth the effort!"
11,5.0,"Visited this palace while I was in Seoul for business. It’s absolutely beautiful and the changing of the guard ceremony is so interesting to watch. If you’re in Seoul, definitely check this out!"
12,5.0,I visited this palace as a part of incheon transit tour. It was a beautiful palace with peaceful surrounding. The place was clean and well maintained.
13,4.0,"Tool subway and easy to get there. Entrance fee is cheap and full of tourists. Many ppl wear traditional Korea clothing entering the palace. Ticketing queue at the main entrance is always long in the morning. From the staff, there are 2 more ticketing entrance which has far less ppl at the side and back. The palace is huge and you could spend more than half day walking and taking photos. It is worth visiting for first time."
14,5.0,"I had a nice, peaceful visit to this place.  It is vast and has many palaces to see.  I walked around and saw many trees, flowers, and places to sit.  The signs are in Korean and English and give history on each of the buildings.  This is a fabulous place to take a stroll through.  I enjoyed it immensely."
15,5.0,We strolled for hours in the vast palace compound and enjoyed every bit of it.It's beautiful and maintained in good condition.We would recommend to come in the morning so you can enter also the museum (closes at around 17:00~18:00).
16,4.0,"Very large grounds to explore.  80% of the visitors wear (rent) traditional korean dress.On the plus side, it's good photo opportunities and there is a lot to see. I recommend audio guides as there are very few signs telling you what you are looking at.Down side, a lot of open space with nothing but tourists to look at No grass for the most part just dirt and the walking paths are uneven granite stones."
17,5.0,"Before visiting the palace I went into the free museum which is situated inside the walls of the palace, beautiful inside. You pay for tickets at a small booth very reasonable price, once inside all I can say is stunning"
18,3.0,"If you would like just to have a look at the neighbourhood, the grand palace and people strolling with their traditional hanbok, you can just stay outside and take wonderful pictures without having to soend your money getting inside as there were not so much to see."
19,4.0,"Everything about this Palace resonates history and the rich culture of the Koreans. Entry is free for vistors in the traditional outfit (Hanbok) and at a low cost for visitors without the outfit. There are several shops near the near Palace where you can rent a Hanbok for 1 to 2hours. The cost of renting my outfit was ₩10,000 for 2hours. The palace also has a park where you can have lunch after some sightseeing. This is worth your last penny. Enjoy"
20,3.0,"Nice enough, but big open space and after you’ve stared at it for 5-10 mins...wondering what to do with one’s self."
21,5.0,Nice and worthwhile visit to the best palace complex of the city.. Try to have a sunset visit that will give you a unique and less crowded experience
22,5.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is an amazing experience and worth the visit when in Seoul!  Step back into time more than 600 years to walk these grounds and take in all the history that makes this palace a “MUST VISIT”.!  The grounds are vast with countless buildings, gates and walls to wonder around and take in all the aspects of Korean history and culture! Make sure you give yourself at least a couple hours for this one; it is spread out with lots to take in. Highly recommend.!!"
23,5.0,"I went by myself via the subway, which was very safe and interesting. The palace a short walk from the stop. I timed my arrival with the changing of the guard. I spent 2-3 hours here, wandering about and taking photos. The numerous costumed guests afforded me great shots as they posed, ran, or peaked out. The entry fee was reasonable. I'm happy tourists are allowed to view the grounds.Afterwards, I walked around the area and saw a huge protest at Gwanghwamun Square, which is a gathering place in front of the palace. I was told there something going on there almost daily. A further bit down the road and I ran into a Starbucks and then on to the tourist information center, where they were very helpful. I need an SD card for my phone and they called the nearby bookstore and inquired if they did indeed sell the cards as I had been told. I then walked across the street, to the bookstore, and discovered that it is nothing like I would know in the USA. They sell all manner of things inside that store. It was very interesting there too. This area is a must-see!"
24,5.0,- A must visit palace - entrance fee for foreigners is 3000 won- seniors more than 65 years old enter free- Free guided tours in 4 languages between 1000-1600 hours- 2 types of Guard Changing Ceremoniesa. Changing of palace guard ceremony- held in square inside Gwanghwamun gate- 10am and 2pm- free to enter this area without palace ticketB. Gate Guard duty performance- outside Gwanghwamun gate on road side- 11am and 1pm
25,4.0,"Most iconic symbol of all of Korea. The largest and most scenic of all the Palace with Mount Bugaksan in the background. Changing of the Guard Ceremony is a must: 1000 and 1300. Entry Fee is 3,000 won. Close every Tuesday. You can reach Gyeongbokgung Palace by taking Subway Line 3 to Gyeongbokgung Station Exit 3."
26,5.0,"No exaggeration, you could easily spend 4-5 hours roaming the palace grounds. It's absolutely massive and full of things to explore. Great photo ops all over as well. Normally there's an entrance fee, but I went last week and didn't have to pay anything. One thing to note, when they say it closes at 6, they mean your butt better be out by 6. Those guards do not play at all, lol."
27,4.0,To me it was more of a giant park than a historical palace visit. It is very large and so if you are wanting more than a beautiful peaceful walk I recommend going during one of the times with a tour guide.
28,5.0,This huge palace is a must see while in Seoul.  Its got so much to see and is right in the middle of the city.  Lots of people were dressed up in traditional korean attire.  Great place for pictures and scenery or just for a nice long walk.
29,5.0,A history of Korean empire with. Beautiful architecture and surrounded by beautiful greenery.the cafeteria sitting place is very cute with wooden huts.
30,4.0,"This palace is huge. The buildings are lovely. Not much to see inside them. Very cool though. Plan several hours if you want to see everything. The changing of the guards is something I only saw at this palace and was nice to see. Crowded toward the front, but far fewer people toward the back. Good view of the ""blue palace"" from the back gate. Gwanghwamun on the purple line is the subway stop I used."
31,5.0,"I don't know where to start on reviewing this astonishingly beautiful palace except to say it us utterly beguiling and unmissable.It's so big and there is so much to see, different parts deserve their own listings to be honest!The highlight for me was the Gyeongheru Pavilion, just beautiful as its surrounded by a gorgeous lake. Its lovely to sit there and relax. Close second, and most people's favourite I'd say, is the majestic Geunjeongjon Hall which is the throne hall. The intricacy and colours are just mesmeric The King and Queens living quarters are lovely too and there is just so many lovely colourful and intricately decorated buildings around, not to mention scenic grounds. The row of chimneys in the Amisan Gardens to the rear of the queens consorts residence are interesting as they were vents for the underfloor heating!Anyway, give several hours, most of a day over to explore this magnificent palace complex. 5 stars just doesn't seem enough to give."
32,5.0,"If you only have time to visit one palace, I recommend this one. It is the largest of the 5 palaces and most impressive. Expect this palace you be crowded. Many female visitors are wearing the traditional dresses, which are great for photo shoots. Palace compound is huge, with many halls, rooms, quarters, pavilions etc. I spent about 1.5 hours exploring this compound.Time yourself to witness the changing of royal guards ceremony daily at 1000hr and 1400hr. Ceremony is held at the public square in front of the palace entrance. Hence, you can even watch this ceremony without purchasing the palace entrance ticket. If time permits, you can also visit the 2 nearby museums which are free admission, ie National Palace Museum of Korea and the National Folk Museum."
33,5.0,"A must visit!  Don't miss the changing of guard show twice a day.  Cross the street and visit the Gwanghwamun Square where you can see King Sejong statue and visit the little informative museum.  Free, informative and a nice respite from the heat."
34,5.0,"Right place for a nice walk and to admire a lot of people wearing the traditional hanbok. It's the main Palace of the city so you should not miss it. If you are familiar with Asia and mostly with China, you will feel as you've been there already..."
35,5.0,"Take a whole day to explore this impressive place. There are so many different parts  you can wander for ages. Kids can run free to their heart's content which is an extra if you are travelling with children. Make sure to see the change of the guards ( a few times a day).Gyeongbokgung palace is located in the center of Seoul and easy to acces. Bukchon Hanok Village, Insadong and Cheonggyecheon are in walking distance."
36,5.0,"I went there early to avoid the crowds, but there were still too many tourists around the main palace. I recommend you keep walking inside, there would be more peaceful and you can enjoy your time there"
37,4.0,"This was the first, largest and the main royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty. It was destroyed during the Japanese occupation and has taken much time and effort to be rebuilt and restored. The Changing of the Guard happened while I was there at about 9:30am. Free admission to even foreigner seniors. Many of the girls and some boys even wore the hanbok costumes for Instagram photos. From here one can go to the Folk Museum and then on to Bukchon Hanbok Village and then the Chandeokgong Palace which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Expect to spend many hours exploring this whole area as it is well worth it. Moving on from there take in lunch on Insadong Street and browse the shops. This will be such a day well spent in Seoul."
38,5.0,A MUST visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace.  The grounds have been restored.   The Changing of the Guard.   Highly recommended.
39,5.0,"The original palace dates back to the 1300s but various invasions by the Japanese in the 1500s, 1800s and 1910 has meant a lot fo the original palace has been destroyed. Much of the palace is reproductions of the original buildings but the architecture is still very impressive. Be equipped with walking shoes and headwear as the palace is quite expansive and exposed"
40,4.0,Love the architecture and colours on the  palace . It wax good to see the guards in traditional dress.  There are also a lot of ladies dressed in hanbok. 3000 Won entrance fee. Souvenir shop and cafe off to the side.
41,4.0,"I arrived in time to watch the changing of the guard at the entrance. It's long, involved and colourful. It's a busy place but there's lots to see. I joined a guided tour and am glad I did as it is vital to understand the place.There were a lot of tourists wearing hired traditional costumes wandering around adding to the colour."
42,4.0,"The entrance, main palace and the palace museum are a must see (KW3000 entrance fee). The changing of the guards is an added bonus if you happen to be on time for the event.  Note that the palace is expansive which require a lot of walking on stone path and gravel.  There are  not much shaded tress and places to rest expect around buildings.  So an early morning visit is recommended.  I made a reservation for an English guided tour of the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion only be disappointed as the tour guide decided to conduct it in the local vernacular.  I did inquire though as she stated that she can give me a 10 minute English guide after she is done with the group but left before she finished."
43,5.0,"Free entry on Wednesday is a bonus but either way the grounds are extensive and beautiful with palace complex, craft shop and museum all in one spot. Great way to spend an afternoon. I shall return in order to see the changing of the guards."
44,5.0,"A wonderful and huge palace to visit, the place is very wide and i guess it will take almost few hours to complete the whole place to visit. This is one of must places to visit. There are Museum, park, lot of unique buildings (palaces), kids zone and many more. You will spend almost half day or even full day here...."
45,4.0,"Being one of the prominent sites for tourists, Gyeonbokgung can get very busy. Try to time your visit to see the changing of the guard - it's actually quite impressive. There is no charge to watch the changing of the guard, but if you want to go inside the palace there is a small (not unreasonable) fee. Make sure you find a spot in the crowds near to the roped off area so that you can see what's going on. The palace grounds are vast. After visiting the buildings closest to the entrance, keep walking to see all the buildings behind. You'll find you get right away from the bulk of the crowds and can better enjoy the ambience of the place."
46,5.0,"Beautiful, peaceful!! So amazing to see everyone Dress up and take photos in traditional garb.Adorable, mothers and daughters, girls, boys and young families all done up.. so stunning. It’s a large enclosed palace grounds with loads of history and traditional Korean culture to take in.. cheap to get in and lots of ground to cover, perfect for a long stroll through time and a must if your visiting Seoul!!! Right downtown"
47,5.0,"This place is just gorgeous. You have the option of taking a guided tour but I opted to just wander around on my own. Signage is in Korean and English and there are printed guides in several languages. If you want to stick to a set time frame take the guided tour, but note yours in your language are limited to specific times of the day and the tour will typically last an hour to an hour and a half. I personally had fun wandering at my own pace and ended up spending several hours walking, viewing, thanking photos and videos, sitting and people watching, etc. it’s just a beautiful setting and experience."
48,4.0,"Very good palace overall~! It was May 2018 when I went there for the first time. Lots of people around this area because it was the main city centre. The changing of the guard is around 14:00 therefore, you should make good use of your timing if you wanna see the changing of the guard. The black shingles of the palace is a close resemblance of the Chinese palaces in Nanjing. Along the way, there are tons of Korean BBQ restaurants there and also the city hall with the I Love Seoul in the Garden! It's beautiful."
49,5.0,I went here to see changing of the guards. It is different to what I expected! There is announcements in English so you understand what is going on. If you enter through the main gate stand on the right they will go out the gate and come back in.
50,5.0,Entry was cheap. Went in the weekend and even though it was very crowded but the area is more than big enough. Lots of good photo spots. Many people were getting their pictures taken.
51,4.0,We got here at around 1pm just in time for the last Changing of Guards. Great to see part of Korea's history and culture. There were too many tourist at the time of our  visit that it's too hard to take a photo without photobombers LOL.
52,3.0,"I found this place to be initially beautiful, but it's really just a place for Koreans to get dressed up in traditional clothes and use the palace for their own personal photo shoots. Fun for about 10 minutes."
53,5.0,"This was a lovely (and cheap) way to spend a few hours. The palace and grounds are huge. Once you get away from the main palace and start to explore the grounds, the crowds of people almost disappear and it is beautiful. I liked this palace better than Changdeokgung, even though people rave about how great Changdeokgung is...I preferred Gyeongbokgung overall. One of the best things to do in Seoul in my opinion."
54,1.0,"The ceremonies (including the changing of guards, guard inspection, guard training) were so boring, with most of them involving a group of men walking out in a line and/or walking around in circle before walking back.Even the tour inside the palace ground and the actual buildings were completely underwhelming - especially when you've been to other palaces in Japan and China."
55,4.0,"Beautiful palace in the heart of downtown bustling Seoul. Very beautiful grounds but EXTREMELY CROWDED and offputting because of that. Changing of the guard is twice per day and ceremonial, rather staged and tacky in my opinion but attracts huge crowds as well. If you're in Seoul it's a must see tourist attraction...but keep in mind, emphasis on the word TOURIST! And plenty of them!"
56,4.0,It’s a nice place and too crowded. It will be nice if you rent Hanbok for all your pictures but i didn’t do it coz when i see the crowd haha nvm. It would be bice if you come when cherry blossom blooms during last week of march first week of april. All in all it’s a nice experience in seoul
57,1.0,Overcrowded and not free.Bunch of people dressing the same way and taking selfies. IMO you can visit other great attractions in Seoul which are all free and less crowded.There is also a lack of places to rest and get a break from the sun.Take a picture and leave.
58,5.0,"I came here from Chunjeongno Stn, commuting a public bus. It took me only 20 minutes to arrive here. wonderful place. entrance fee just 3000 krw per person but If you rent their Hanbok , you will get a free entrance. Goodlucl"
59,5.0,"This palace is in the same grounds as the Folk museum and, luckily I visited in Springtime when all of the cherry trees were in full bloom. It was built for the founder of the Joseon Dynasty, destroyed by the Japanese in the 16th century and rebuilt in the 19thC.  It has four gates leading to it, the most important being the southern gate outside which there is daily a colourful changing of the guard ceremony."
60,5.0,Pensioners get free entry for a start.It is a large place to walk around and see the gardens and the lake.I watched a performance by the local band and dancers which was entertaining.You are not allowed in the palace grounds so the gardens is all you get.
61,5.0,"Alot and alot of people were wearing traditional korean dresses, and it just made it very fun taking photos around. Great palace, with alot of people wearing traditional dresses made it complete . Loved my cruising around there...."
62,5.0,Big temple Areal with a long history. But was destroyed while the conflicts. It’s very similar to the forbidden city in Beijing. Take a walk around and use the west entrance! It’s new and nobody’s there. Very close to the bus station with the same name.
63,4.0,The banqueting hall by the lake/large pond was the best feature of this Palace as the cherry trees were in bloom and the willows were well and truly weeping. The site overall is a pleasant spot with some nice reconstructed buildings giving a feel of how life was before the palace was destroyed by the Japanese. The changing of the guard at 10.am and 2pm is well worth timing the visit for and puts the British iof the Guard at Buckingham Palace into perspective. This is so much more colourful.
64,5.0,"Beautiful place, but try to visit it as early as possible (opens at 09:00), because there're too many tourists later. As all palaces have sth in common, you may need to visit only one or two."
65,2.0,"Very disappointed. Have seen better and more luxury royal residences in China, Thailand and elsewhere. Probably a must for a day in Seoul but half an hour is probably enough."
66,5.0,Easily accessible by metro from the grand ambassador hotel only four stops. Renting a Hanbok entitles you to free entry.
67,4.0,"Very interesting place to visit, most often free tours are available from cultural youth which are quite good"
68,5.0,"Dont miss the Gyeongbokgung palace, the views are incredible. Check the times for changing the guards, it's a good way to start a  visit."
69,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung palace, the obvious seat of government in older times, is a showpiece for the city, staring down at the city's main avenue through the reconstructed Gwanghwamun gate, giving it the proper sightlines so important in eastern palace layouts. Being the main palace in Seoul, it features a number of displays, including performers in traditional dress showing various aspect of court pageantry. Also worth visiting is the folk museum within.The detailing and shape of the roofs are unique, and the large number of carved stone figures, some of them unfortunately encased in transparent boxes due to unruly visitors, interesting indeed. Lovely day !"
70,5.0,This is a must in Seoul. Built 25 years before the Forbidden City. It looked to somehow similar in structure. Beautiful buildings. Interesting heating systems in the ancient buildings.They have a change of guards ceremony. Amazing !!!  I enjoyed the visit.
71,4.0,"You can walk around all over the grounds by yourself and read the signs they have.  But the your best bet is to take the guided tour in your language.  They are offered several times a day.  Check their website for the most up to date information.  The changing of the guard is also a must see.  Lots of people in traditional dress.  Cheap to get in.  Less than $3 US.  Wear your walking shoes.  The ground is uneven everywhere, and there are lots of steps, and a few ramps."
72,4.0,Took photos here and went to the museum to understand a bit more about korean lifestyle and culture.
73,3.0,"This was very easy to find on the train from Seoul. Large courtyards with many people who rented traditional Korean attire at the entrance and roamed the palace grounds. There’s a museum, cafe, and a separate center that demonstrated playing traditional instruments."
74,5.0,this is thes best place to viti.  very educational..once you step in you can really feel you are there during joseon time
75,4.0,"The Palace is not just one or two buildings, but rather a large complex, similar to the Forbidden City in Beijing. Lots of things to see, but not too much to do, although it’s hard to appreciate what you’re looking at when you’re not too familiar with Korean history. Luckily there’s a free English walking tour (free after having paid the entrance fee). The changing of the guards is a fun experience, and makes for some good pictures."
76,5.0,"You have to dedicate half of your day to tour the whole palace, the museums inside and watching of change of guards.You may enter the front gate and National Palace museum (on the left side exit after entering the main gate) for free.  Charges apply on the Palace entrance. All palace entrance fee are free during Chuseok holiday."
77,5.0,"I was told to choose this palace if I could make just one. I am glad I followed the advise. Very easy to get there, and the experience was more than expected. I got lucky and saw the change of guards, and saw a lot (hundreds) of local people in local customs taking pictures of themselves and visiting the palace. I asked them why they were dressed like that and the answer was a tradition- loved it."
78,5.0,"Lovely day spent with our guide Stella & our mini bus driver. We visited Gyeongbok Palace which was amazing. Jogye Buddhist temple, dressed up in hanbok in Insadong which was fun. We got a little time to shop than we had a wonderful traditional Korean lunch. We visited Bukchon Hanok Village, went past the Blue House on our way to Bugak skyway that over looks the city of Seoul & finished in Myeongdong to shop. Stella was a terrific guide, warm & friendly, & she paced the day perfectly. The bus was clean & the driver very capable. I highly recommend this tour."
79,4.0,"the Palace was nice with large gardens, but in winter lots of areas where cordoned off and many of the buildings where closed.  The change of the guard is at 9:30 and is a very nice complement"
80,4.0,"I visited on a public holiday so there were many visitors at the time. Lots of space, artefacts, old court documents, costumes."
81,5.0,"Our guide met us just after the changing of the guards, and took us on a full tour of the palace.  She was really knowledgeable, and her English was excellent.  I highly recommend this tour, and others provided by Seoul City Walking Tours as well!!"
82,5.0,"This one is definitely one of my favorite place during my 5 year living in Seoul. The place can be crowded sometimes but if you choose the right time to visit, this place offers a lot. They have a lot of spot where you can take beautiful pictures, and they offer a different vibes every different season. And there's also this museum inside the palace where you can learn about Korea's past time. So yeah, it's good. =DOh~! and one more thing, if you come here wearing a Hanbok (Korean traditional costume) then you can get inside here for free."
83,5.0,"Explored the palace twice actually. It was nice but everything is restored according to my friend. But still, it is very beautiful"
84,5.0,Opportunity to go back in time and enjoy the history of South Korea. Wonderful experience. Enjoy wonderful day of exploring and a tasty local lunch. Food cost in Korea is very inexpensive compared to USA. Can afford to eat out everyday.
85,4.0,"I went here with my friend. It was a very nice experience. The palace is so beautiful, and there are things to do and see here too. You can do traditional arts and crafts, watch make-believe guards standing near by, and stroll along and take picture with King Sejong's beautiful statue. It is in front of the main gate, before you enter the palace. Also, you can see the Blue House from a distance. The Blue House is like the White House in the US, where the President lived and worked, or hold government meetings. It was nice to see. It is just across from the palace. I can see guards standing nearby. Pretty impressive!!!"
86,5.0,"It is a pride of our nation, But it is a shame when lose our country,But we hope it will be a lesson  for our next generations."
87,4.0,"One of the 5 grand palaces built by kings of Joseon dynasty, Gyeongbokgung Palace offers a good glimpse of Korean tradition and history. The complex is huge and seems to always full of people wearing Hanbok. Well worth 1-2 hour visit. Stay longer if you want to take a royal tea ceremony or learn to make rice cake."
88,5.0,I had a great time here it was informative and easy to get around even on a Sunday when many people visit. Be aware that the museum on the left as you enter is free (and also worth it) but there is one further in that has a cost of I believe 3000 won.If you can go in the winter you may even be able to see the frozen lake which is a great photo opportunity!
89,5.0,"Several buidings to see, also big grounds with a lake. There are occasional guided tours, or you can just wander."
90,5.0,The Gyeongbokgung Palace is a must when visiting Seoul. The Palace is easily accessible within the city and very well maintained. You can rent the traditional Korean dress and go for a walk around the premises. The Palace covers a large area and you would be able to visit different premises within the Palace which offers a close encounter with the Palace history and Korean culture. Take your time and walk around while taking some pictures it would be time well spent.
91,5.0,"I accidentally joined the free guided tour they provided, and didn’t regret it at all. It’s definitely a must visit place when you’re in Korea."
92,5.0,The palace has free tours of the grounds with narration in English.  It was really interesting to get views of how Korean royalty lived.
93,5.0,"The lake was frozen when I went in February but it was absolutely gorgeous. Learned alot about the history of Korea. The explanations are available in Korean, English, and Mandarin. Also visited the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang Special Exhibition ""Wintering"" at one of the museums. I remember wishing there were more food options."
94,5.0,"Beautiful place, which closes at 17:00So plan accordingly for your visit and enjoy the most of it.Rafael"
95,4.0,"If you wear a Hanbok, you get to enter the palace for free. It's a very huge palace with majestic architecture. They have free guided tours too."
96,5.0,"Acclaimed as the most beautiful palace in Seoul, Gyeongbokgung does measure up to its reputation. With over half a century of existence it encompasses a large area with many buildings and pavilions. I paid USD 10 for entrance and audio guide and spend 3 hours exploring the palace. Despite the large number of tourists, students and locals dressed in typical outfits posing for pictures, one doesn't get the feeling of being crowded. Many buildings were reconstructed to its original design and are very well preserved. I thought the audio guide to be very useful given that there were not many descriptive boards.If you have little time to visit Seoul - as in my 14 h layover - this is the place to visit."
97,5.0,"I wish I had allowed myself more to explore this palace's halls. However, the short time I was there well whetted my palate to know more about Korean dynastic history.Picturesque, colorful, and ripe with color, texture, and imagery."
98,3.0,I came here on Sunday noon. There are loads of visitors however you can manage some space in the palace grounds. All the buildings are new since the original were destroyed. It was a really pity. The grounds aren’t huge so you can cover it within 2 hours.
99,5.0,"I would not miss this palace whenever I came to Seoul. It was just magnificent. Crowded most of the time especially on weekends. If you are lucky, you may be able to visit at night. This year, it closed on Nov. 3. New comers are usually fascinated by the imperial guard ceremonies in the front courtyard. Since I have visited the place many times previously, I rather look for interesting people and things around, for photography."
100,5.0,Visit during autumn/fall season. The scenery very nice with dry cold condition. Need to spend a lot of time due to the big area of the palace.
101,4.0,One of the 4 palaces in Jongmyo. Good place for photos and it is huge. Happen to also witness protests going on outside the palace.Pretty unique experience and ticket is affordable. Just that a lot of walking to do.
102,5.0,I was impressed by the beauty of the Palace and its huge territory. In spite of rainy weather tour to tha Palace was very interesting and informative.
103,5.0,"If you only have time to visit one of Seoul’s grand palaces, I would recommend this palace.  If at all possible, time your visit for either 10 AM or 2 PM for the changing of the guard.  You won’t even need to buy an admission ticket to see the guards as they will perform just inside the main gate.  About 20 minutes before the above hours the guards will be marching outside the grounds to the changing area.  They will be playing drums so you’ll know.  Grab a spot outside the blue nylon “crowd control belts” for the best photo opportunities.  If you wait too long you’ll be behind 2-4 people.  Keep in mind if you’re expecting something similar to Buckingham Palace you may be mildly disappointed.  I would estimate there are only about 25-50 marchers/musicians.  Still, it’s a wonderful exhibition."
104,5.0,"From what I recall, this place used to serve as the king's household back in the day. It was destroyed a few times, but it has been restored to its striking beauty. The main palace and gate can be quite busy with tourists, but if you wander off into the surrounding gardens, you will feel as though you have been transported back in time. It's just you and no one else.You can almost imagine what the palace would have been like back in the day, with the queen's ladies rushing back and forth, scholars being fully concentrated on their books, concubines hidden within the palace walls, and the king ordering his soldiers around. I would highly recommend that if you are planning to go to only one palace during your time in Seoul, that you go to this one."
105,4.0,"Neat place.  Though destroyed last in the 20th century Japanese occupation, it has been nicely restored.  The grounds are extensive so plan a couple of hours, depending on your speed and interest in details.  The great thing is that a guided tour is available once you have paid the 3,000 KW admission (like $3US); the tour is available in Chinese, Japanese and English (I assume Korean too!).  The English one was available twice / day.  11AM and, I think, 1:30 PM.  The guided tour helps appreciate more than the structures so I recommend that you do it as otherwise you are just looking at interesting buildings but miss the ""why"" and ""how"" of royal times in Korea.  It is very convenient to the metro.  The Blue House (President's House) is right outside the north entrance to the palace grounds so go out the north gate to see it from a distance (you can re-enter palace grounds with your ticket OR, what I recommend, walk east along the outer walls and venture into the historic Bukchon village area just east of the palace).  The changing of the guards occurs twice a day:  10 AM and 2 PM."
106,5.0,Went there as part of the group tour package we had on Nov 1-6 2018. I havent read anything about the place so i cherished the experience of just soaking it all in. We went first to the National museum and just a stone throw away is the entrance of this palace. We just basically went directly to the Kings chamber and Queens quarter then that's just it. most of the rooms are close. would have been better if tourist can see what is inside those roomscome a bit early if you don't want other tourist ruining your pictorials. mostly tourists arrived around 10am just like ours in time of the changing of guards ceremony..
107,5.0,This palace is very atmospheric as you see locals dress in traditional clothing whilst sightseeing. Lots of interesting structures to see. Can get crowded but can still take good photos.
108,4.0,You can’t get in to too many buildings but just walking around is stunning.  The bright colours and the architecture - worth it.
109,4.0,"Worth visiting to learn about Korean history. Don't go in rainly weather as part of the ground is sandy. Check the time for free guided tour, and definitely the guard change ceremony twice a day (10:00 am and 2:00pm). If you want to dress in traditional Korean costumes, you rent in nearby shops and don't need to purchase the ticket."
110,4.0,"A taste of Korean history. Don’t forget to check the timing changing of guards inside the Palace with their traditional military attire. Feel free to roam around the Palace like Joseun’s princesses, princes or even like a King! You can rent traditional outfits inside. A must for K-drama fans. Explore korean cuisins outside the Palace as well. Best time to travel in fall, winter or spring time! Korean history is cool and very interesting!"
111,4.0,"Really pretty in autumn, with lots of golden leaves everywhere. Stunning buildings and tranquil pools."
112,4.0,"I thought the most amazing thing about the palace was the surroundings. You looking at these hundreds of years old buildings, no running water, hot water electricity, turn your head and see skyscrapers.The juxtaposition of the new and old is one of the best things about South Korea, the past isnt just there, its embraced and celebrated and the palace is one of the best examples of that.Plan half the day, the buildings really do look similar and its easy to get turned around, i recommend using the information map and having a pen to mark off the buildings listed to make sure you really saw everything. The best part was that it wasn't a look and dont touch experience, there is a library on the grounds that you can enter, they give you slippers, and look at the books."
113,4.0,"Very close from Subway station in line 3 (gyeongbokgung station), this is a must see if you are a few days in town. Not expensive ( 3000 krw), no big wait line. I was lucky to arrive at 10 am on a Saturday when a show with dressed up Korean warriors played a ceremonial entrance at the sound of trumpets and gong. In addition, not as crowded as historical sites in Beijing. Thumb up therefore."
114,5.0,"When I visited the palace was closed to the public, it is closed on Tuesday, but nevertheless I was not disappointed, it easy to get to the palace by subway, you to get to Seoul station, read the map, buy the ticket and get to the palace station, from there it is about a 3-5 minutes walk to the palace, there is a museum with a couple shops and café nearby, it was raining when I visited so my exploration was limited, however I would recommend the palace visit, entry to the museum was free of charge and the subway is inexpensive, on average it costs about 5000 south Korean won per trip one way and the journey may take about 1 hour from Seoul station."
115,5.0,The museum is a good introduction to Korean history and society.Unfortunately was a rainy day and walking outside was limited.
116,4.0,It's worth seeing this palace and get to know some historical facts.Huge Palace and you need to buy ticket to enter the main Palace.
117,4.0,"Visited this palace during the fall season, and you will see the surroundings with yellowish or redish trees. I only visited 2 palaces in total, but seems this is one of the biggest? Not too sure. It seems that the palace internal design and its layout looks pretty much similar. If you are one who watched quite a few of those Korea’s ancient drama, you will feel that those drama scene came alive in front of you. There’s a national museum (just right when you came out of the station) which is free admission. Personally, I find it really interesting as you get to know the rich history of Korea in the past. Further ahead (right besides the museum), there’s a park (at least that’s what I think it is) where you will see a big massive big yellowish tree. Many people who rented the traditional hanbok costume will be taking pictures at there. It was really some nice scene and relaxing."
118,5.0,"The palace is really characteristic and I recommend its visit. Remember, that you need to purchase a ticket to enter the area."
119,5.0,"This is the most popular palace in Seoul, for both locals and foreigners.If you only have a few hours in Seoul between business meetings, I recommend starting from here, take a stroll down towards the City Hall.Gyeongbok Palace's pond is one of must-see views of Seoul."
120,5.0,"I came here on Sunday not really sure what to expect having read that it is a very popular place. Certainly the queues at the ticket counters weren't as long as the day before, but nevertheless I was rather apprehensive about getting caught up in the crowds. As it was I didn't need to worry. There were a lot of people around but the grounds are really impressively big and I never felt being in an overcrowded situation. Indeed, the deeper you walk north towards the Bukaksan mountain, the thinner the crowds become. I found myself walking though some Palace buildings completely on my own. I wasn't worried by the paucity of information in the English language. I navigated around with a small pamphlet available near the entrance and dipped into the internet whenever I needed special information like details about the alleged gruesome assassination of Queen Myeongseong by Japanese assassins.Indeed it's worth noticing that this ""Brilliance and Fortune"" Palace (Gyeon Bok) of the Joseon dynasty was destroyed by fire and Japanese invaders going back many centuries (and even as recently as the 1940s during the last WW2). And most, if not all of the buildings were restored since the 1990!sI visited on a lovely warm, sunny October day which was ideal. I was really impressed to see so many people dressed in traditional ""Hanbok"" costumes from the Joseon period. There were even the odd (really odd) groups of lads dressed up in the costumes usually reserved for ladies... Apparently anyone so dressed gets preferential and free access to the palaces, so now you know."
121,5.0,Arrived just in time to watch the changing of the guard. Neat to see and get to take pictures with them. The palace grounds is quite large and lots to see. Do recommend!
122,5.0,"Easy to visit, not expensive (I paid my entrance 3000 Wons), it is beautifully restored and shows that grandeur of the Joseon . You can visit the palace, the pavilions, lots of beautiful gardens. This palace used to be the home of Kings of the Joseon dynasty, the Kings' households, as well as the government of Joseon. Not to be missed!"
123,5.0,"Chinese style palace, but still very beautiful.You can enjoy the palace with Korean traditional clothes which could be rented out side the palace.Very beautiful inside.Must see spot!中國式的宮殿，但仍然非常壯麗。你可以在景福宮外頭租韓國傳統的服飾一遊景福宮。宮殿內頭非常漂亮。非常推薦的景點。"
124,5.0,This is one of the biggest palace i every been in Seoul. You can hire Hanbok nearby and take pictures about the whole palace. There are alot of different performance nearby such as Folk museum and others within the palace. There are alot to see inside the palace and alot of photo area to pose with your hanbok!
125,4.0,"Seoul is one of my favorite cities and this palace is a great place to start a Seoul visit. The Palace ticket is 10,000 Won and a great deal. It allows you to visit all 4 palaces which charge entry plus the Joseon tombs and the secret garden tour. This palace is the center of Seoul and considered the most important palace in the Joseon reign. The guided tour is worth taking and then you can go to the nearby folk museum or palace museum. Plan about 2 hours for the palace and 4-6 hours if you combine it with the excellent neighboring museums."
126,3.0,I dont like this place. It's better to go to Kyoto (Japan ) or Hue ( Vietnam ). I think I wont come back.
127,5.0,Rent a hanbok and wear the traditional Korean outfit for free entry and snap beautiful selfies in the picturesque grounds that also has a cultural centre next door.
128,5.0,I was impressed by how much history this site holds. Even though most of the buildings are not original it's still a great stop in Seoul. Be sure to be present for the changing of the guards that was my favorite part of this visit!
129,5.0,"This is a fantastic palace to visit in Seoul as it's very large and there's so much to see. There are many picturesque views to photograph and if you bought the combination ticket for the palace and royal shrine, you'll be able to read a little of its history in the booklet."
130,5.0,A nice stroll in any time of the day is great in this palace. So much to venture and see. You'll meet friendly locals here just watch out for the tourist ;)
131,4.0,"Stick with your tour guide cos I got lost! Luckily they were able to bring the bus round to get me but still... it’s a beautiful place with lots of history and culture. We arrived in time to see the guard changing ceremony which was great, and there’s a lot to see. A must see if you visit Korea!"
132,4.0,"A must visit for first time visitors. Gyeongbokgung Palace is grandest of all the other palaces in Seoul. Built in the heart of Seoul with a beautiful lake, surrounded by mountains. Guard changing ceremony (guards dressed in Korean traditional costumes) was a real pleasure to watch and gives you an opportunity to experience Korean tradition. Great place to capture gorgeous pictures of the scenery and architecture. Free guided tours in English are available at 11:00, 13:00, and 15:30.Quick Tip: 1. Integrated Ticket of Palaces can help you save money if you wish                       to visit multiple palaces in Seoul.                  2. Wearing traditional Korean dress “Hanbok” will grant you free entry                      into the palace"
133,1.0,"Nothing special. Not real good things, just buildings from the XX century but old style. If possible, go somewhere else..."
134,5.0,"This is a ""MUST-SEE"" if you ever come to Seoul!  I am a huge fan of architecture, and you will find exquisite designs here.  The grounds are vast, and you could walk around for hours, which is what I did and loved every meter of it!  The history here and what was told to me by my girlfriend was simply incredible!  Oddly enough, she had never been and yet lives in Seoul, lol.  You must dedicate at least a couple of hours to explore this wonderous place and even go into the museum if you find yourself with some extra time.  Also, the gardens are just fantastic!"
135,5.0,"I booked a tour including a stop here through Viator. It was great to get to know about the history of the place and also see the changing of the guards at 10 am. It’s a huge area with many buildings. In many ways similar to the Forbidden City in Beijing. Note that there is free access on the last Wednesday of every month. But also expect lots of tourists all the other days. It’s located close to the other palace, in walkable distance but don’t plan both on the same day as I recommend you the guided tour of the Secret Garden which starts at 10.30 am. It is possible to book another time online, though, but I found it fine to take one palace at a time."
136,3.0,You need to come here if you’re planning to visit SeoulJust a ‘must visit’ area. Not more than that i think
137,5.0,Spent time here on my first day and it was worth seeing. Very big and in the centre of places to see for tourists.
138,5.0,I think that it’s a best free thing about Seoul! You will enjoy Korean culture and spirit of the old city. Buildings are so beautiful and mountains near it looks great
139,5.0,I loved visiting this palace. They have free guided tours and you can make reservations at the website.
140,5.0,It is definitely worth stopping by and do try to see the changing of the guards around 10am any day other than Tuesday.
141,4.0,This was a great experience! The palace grounds are large. Easy to get around and English guide and tours available!
142,5.0,The palace is beautiful so well kept and the weather for me was also perfect. there was so much to see and do and the entrance fee was so cheap too!it was just at the change of autumn and the colours were amazing no tree or plant was the same shade! the changing of the guard is fabulous to watch so many people gathered to see it
143,5.0,"The price was around 1-2usd.The amount of places to see and hang around is pretty big and very beautiful views!Comparing to nearby palaces this one is the best value for money. If you want to watch the guard's changing ceremony it's actually outside of the paying zone.There are toilets and cafeteria, nearby is a free of charge museum."
144,4.0,"While interesting to explore, not much areas to take cover for a quick respite from the searing heat of summer. Changing of guard ceremony is a sight to watch, but times and length of ceremony depends on the weather. Ticket is good for one entry only. If you come out to watch the changing of guard ceremony from exploring the palace, you will not be allowed to get in again unless you buy a new ticket, so be careful. Massive structures of palaces and other buildings, all replicas. Still, an experience not to miss when in Seoul."
145,4.0,"Nice place, pool and park inside. Near the mountain. Fresh air and for relax..Easily accessed by metro."
146,5.0,It is worth to wander and see all the areas around. Everything is well protected. Some buildings have rooms furnished and set up to give one a glimpse of how daily life was conducted in this palace.There are 2 museums that are worth visit as well.
147,5.0,Must see place in Seoul. Lots of history. Good for taking pictures. Add it easily to your itinerary when in the area. A bit too hot in August though as little shade.
148,5.0,"Due to time restraints I was only able to stop by for one of the guard-changing ceremonies, but wow! Highly recommended; it's a wonderful opportunity to take-in part of Seoul's rich history, and if you're able to actually go in and see the palace it will undoubtedly be worth it. A must-see on any trip to Seoul."
149,3.0,"I had a personal guide with me but you could totally do this solo!  The change of guards happens at 10am and they have Korean, Chinese, Japanese and English explanations of what is going out throughout the whole process. You prob just need to spend 2 hours here MAX if not less! But I’ve been to China’s Forbidden City Palace already so I wasn’t as wow-ed but it was still a good place to check out and also hit up the museum (exit 5 of the Gyeongbokgung Station - gives some good info and also great to have a break from the heat.  Same exit to visit the palace. It wasn’t overly crowded at this time. After we cabbed it to Bukchon Hanok Village after to check out the old style houses and had lunch at insadong after. They are all close-ish but I wouldn’t walk in summer so just cab/uber it."
150,5.0,"This is one of the most important places to visit when in Seoul. The palace has a lot of interesting history and is full of beautiful old buildings and there is even a cafe and gift shop.The most interesting part is watching the changing of the guard so try to be there when it happens. The guards are dressed in colourful blue and red uniforms and mustaches and beards (they look fake) and the event is pretty interesting and one needs to show respect and not get up in the faces of the guards.All around the palace on the main road and small alleys are shops that hire out traditional costumes for visitors to wear in and around the palace. So inside the palace grounds you can see lots and lots of especially girls wearing these colourful costumes and posing for photos. There are far less men wearing these outfits.I visited the palace on a very hot day and fortunately had a cap with me otherwise I would have been cooked.This is really nice place to visit, nothing compared to the Forbidden City in Beijing, but still an impressive place to visit and spend a couple of hours."
151,5.0,If you're visiting make sure you're there in time for the changing of the guards ceremony. That was lovely to see. The palace grounds are massive and requires a lot of walking. There was a lot of tourists around so be prepared for the crowds.
152,5.0,"Awesome complex of palaces, temples, lakes and gardens! A visit here is a must for any traveler! I had the chance to visit Gyeongbokgung during cherry blossom season, and it was simply magnificent!"
153,4.0,"Whether you are sensitive to history or not, this palace will please you. The guides are very attentive and will give you great anecdotes about the life of the royal Koreans at the height of this building. A must see!"
154,5.0,I went here due to the free transit tour during my long layover in Korea. The palace itself is amazing and good thing that this iconic place is maintained very well. The place is huge hence maps or probably signages will be helpful for foreign people like me.
155,4.0,I really like the style and decoration of Korean palaces so enjoyed this highest one despite the heat of the day - - the complex of buildings covers many acres and there are huge courtyards open to the blazing sum in between buildings so may be best to avoid in the heat of the day. I visited on Sunday so as many as half of the visitors were wearing national dress adding to the experience.  I understand that anyone can rent these as costumes at nearby shops for ~$20 and then receive free admission to the palace and plenty of photo ops.  While I was there a quintet dressed in traditional clothes playing traditional music entertained for a while under a little grove of trees near the garden. Very nice!
156,4.0,Watched the changing of the guards in the morning and then spent 90 minutes exploring the palace. It’s a must visit. Check the times for the changing of the guard.
157,4.0,"Many of the historical sites in S. Korea are rebuilt or refurbished, but they are beautiful all the same. They have a strong cultural tradition, much like their food traditions -- that are interesting and rich."
158,4.0,"Many royal palaces, some unfortunately under re-construction. Good to stroll around even wihout a guide."
159,5.0,"Watching the Changing of the Guard Ceremony was free but to get into the rest of Gyeongbokgung Palace cost 3000Won.  It was sunny and hot with no shade to watch the Ceremony at 10 am.  I highly recommend wearing a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen.  Some people were using umbrellas.  There are free pamphlets about the Changing of the Guard Ceremony and about Gyeongbokgung Palace near the main entrance of Gwanghwamun Gate.The layout of the palace complex reminded me of Beijing’s Forbidden City.  Gyeongbokgung Palace is the largest of the four main palaces.  There are free guided tours in English.  Just wait by the sign just past the ticket entrance at Heungnyemun Gate.  I joined the one that started at 11 am.  The tour lasted about an hour and the guide was very good and spoke very good English.  You’re free to wander around after the tour.I combined the visit to the Palace with visits to the nearby National Folk Museum of Korea and National Palace Museum of Korea.  The National Folk Museum of Korea is right in the Palace ground and the National Palace Museum of Korea is next the exit 5 of the Gyeongbokgung Station for the L3 subway line."
160,5.0,"If in Seoul, you have to visit this place. Make sure to check opening hours and days that are closed. Sometimes, there are events and the palace can be closed. Take comfortable shoes, since you will be walking a lot. Make sure to take a hat and water with you as well. It will take at least 2 or 3 hours to check out most of the spots. You will be able to take some lovely photos of the palace and the beautiful settings there. It must have been so quiet and peaceful back then. I have made it to 155 countries. I have an extensive blog at pinchetravels.com, if you want to read more about my travels."
161,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is really nice place and must see place in Seoul, it is located in the right city centre just next to skyscrapers.this place is not just aboutGyeongbokgung Palace itself, there're many other smaller buildings, streets and secluded places. To visit this place in the morning seems to be better to avoid crowds."
162,5.0,The vastness of the palatial palace can't be captured with a picture. It is absolutely splendid. I suggest you do the hanbok rental. Also use the metro to travel to the palace as it takes you to the doorstep of the palace and its the cheapest method and best method of transportation. A must see!!
163,5.0,"I loved this Palace. I enjoyed it a lot even tho it was raining hard when I went to visit in May.Some of the pictures have some sun light and many have rain drops.I’m a single 25 world travelerThe admission for the palace was very affordable 300 Won about 2.70 USD.I went by myself and I enjoyed walking around and seeing history and Korean style of Agriculture.I travel a lot and I enjoy seeing history and different styles.I roamed around the palace for hours and hours lots to see and capture. I sometimes imagine myself in the times when the palace was created and how great there building methods were to be able to still be shown today.If you are by yourself like me or in a huge group it will be perfect for EVERYONE I also enjoyed visiting the store in the Gyeongbokgung Palace.I love buying homemade Souvenirs, prices were reasonable.If you want to get the beautiful jewelry or crafted big items they are expensive.Make sure to ask for Tax Free if you are American or a Foreigner.Hope you enjoyed my pictures and a MUST see if you are in Seoul, South Korea 🇰🇷"
164,5.0,"This was a great attraction, and I spent several productive hours here. THe Chosun Dynasty relics were particularly interesting. The ticket prices seemed reasonable and so many of the buildings and annexes were intensely photogenic."
165,5.0,"Large Palace complex adjacent to government precinct.  Beautifully rebuilt and very well maintained.  Can self-navigate, and different language brochures available including English. Check tines for opening and changing of guard (a colourful highlight).  Plan for 1.5 to 2 hours."
166,5.0,"This looks like almost very other imperial palace, with the entry gates and rings of buildings surrounding the central palace. What makes this one different are: (1) the changing of the guard, which is worth seeing/waiting for; and (2) the very many -- at least on the day I visited -- women and men in traditional dress. Lots of picture taking of each other, and it makes the scene much more colorful than at other imperial palaces."
167,4.0,"When you come up to the castle you will see places rent teen out traditional Korean clothing. I later discovered that you can get in the palace for free if you are wearing an outfit. If I remember correctly it was 3000 to get in or 10,000 for admittance to three palaces and One additional attraction. At certain times of the day they have a changing of the guard ceremony which is fun to watch."
168,4.0,My only real complaint is that there really aren't enough English explanations.I enjoyed walking around but a lot of the time you have no clue what you are looking at.That said its easily accessible well maintained and very affordable.
169,5.0,I think that if you are out of Asia you will be very impressed once you visit any palace in Seoul. You need to visit them.
170,5.0,"Gorgeous, history filled and truly a spectacle. Be there by 10am to witness the ceremony of guard change, 11am if you want the free tour guide (which is highly recommended because you really feel attached to the place).."
171,4.0,"The view around the palace is so awesome, many tourists are wearing Hanbok, the place is a bit touristy, recommended to visit when you are in Seoul."
172,4.0,"If you haven't seen korean tradional buildings (palaces, temples etc), you should go here to appreciate the style. They also have a change of guard ceremony in traditional clothes. Once you have seen it, be aware that every other traditional building in korea has near identical shapes, colors etc."
173,5.0,Not expensive (almost 3 USD) and  you will enjoy it a lot! Also you can join a free tour guide (English) and learn everything about the palace and the king.After the tour you can stay there admiring all the palace and it is near of other sightseen sites.
174,4.0,It is easy to get off at one subway stop and travel to many sites on foot through a day in this area. The palace was made even more beautiful with Koreans dressed up in hanboks that you can rent from local shops. Pictures were very fun!
175,5.0,"A wonderful place with great history that showcases South Korea in the bygone days. It is neatly preserved and some parts are being reconstructed to ensure the touch of history is intact. The entry is 3000KW and you will have to walk through the many palaces, rooms and many sites around the complex. A wonderful place to enjoy Korean History and a must visit when in South Korea."
176,5.0,"It is a grand palace with impressive buildings and gardens. In certain times of the year one could visit it at night. For foreigners one could buy the ticket at a special ticket counter near the entrance. I have visited the palace several times, usually after visiting Changdeokgung Palace and Changgyeonggung Palace. From the front of the Changdeokgung Palace, I normally take a taxi for a small fare to go to Gyeongbokgung, as the road traffic goes in that direction ie without a big detour and it also saves a lot of trouble eg going there by metro."
177,5.0,Love the palace and the vibe ! All girls and boys dressed up in Hanbok traditional clothes and as colorful and royal as it looks.
178,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is one of the places to visit in Seoul. It’s a must see place on your visit and gives you a real taste of history. It’s around 3,000 KRW to enter but if you turn up wearing a traditional Hanbok, which many do for great photographic opportunities, you can get in for free. Be sure you watch one of the two daily changing of the guard ceremonies. A great spectacle. Also, be sure to confirm opening times as it closes a couple of day per week. Enjoy."
179,4.0,"One way to get there is by subway - Line 3 exit 5 Gyeongbokgung Station.  This will bring you out directly in front of the National Palace Museum and you can freely enter a side gate into the entry courtyard.  To enter the palace proper, you'll need a ticket - from the ticket booth directly across from the side gate (to the right if you enter the main gates).  This was my first Korean palace and I wasn't disappointed.  Many ordinary people were dressed in Hanboks (traditional dress available for free), which made the atmosphere of the palace come alive.  I liked the smaller details of the walls, buildings, statues, and the few items around ie cauldrons.  In some places, the grounds were empty space where buildings used to be, but there were other surprises around every corner. This could be the statues of the National Folk Museum or the massive pagoda (not the one by the lake) - You can't miss it.  Note: These are still on the grounds but outside the palace - Keep your tickets to re-enter the palace. Well worth a visit."
180,4.0,"Such a rich historical site in Seoul, a lot of travelers visited Gyeongbokgung Palace that day even it was a winter. I took many photos and memories. You can find hanbok (traditional dress) rental around and enter the palace for free. Very recommended."
181,5.0,"It’s a lovely complex. I personally skipped the tour because I could get the history online (and there are video clips of the tour). Also, if you are looking for a reduction in crowds, get there just before the changing of the guard (everyone is watching them, so you have more photo opportunities without the crowds). This worked for me because I had other cultural activities on my itinerary. I did a quick walk around by myself in under an hour."
182,5.0,You can reach here by seoul metro and stop at Gwa ghamun station. The palace is great and have much instagramable spots to take.
183,3.0,"Only gave it a passing review - because I did this without a tour, and it was really boring :X. The compound is huge, u can't step into the building but look at it from outside only. There's tons of tourists wearing hanbok which I feel it is one of the must-do experience. As u venture into the further parts, there are less and lesser tourists but the same building and mini gardens, sigh - tour guide is a must.Don't miss the guard changing routing like I did :( there's 2 rounds of it in a day check out the timing."
184,4.0,"Loved walking around the Palace and grounds.  I opted to do a self guided tour for free and glad I did.  I passed by many guided/paid tours and though you do learn a little more  than reading the signage posted, I do not feel I missed anything and was able to spend more time where I wanted and move on quickly when the lines were long and slow.There are many young girls and boys in period clothing which was fun to see and capture in pictures.  Seems to be the thing to do for the young!"
185,4.0,Don't miss this place If you're interested about history of Korean culture. This palace where you can see the king was living during the ancient centuries.
186,5.0,"Lovely palace, and best appreciated if you join the free tour. You can also rent a hanbok in nearby shops -- I believe you get free admission if you do."
187,5.0,"I spend almost 2 hours here, so many beautiful places here, and it's huge. you should come in spring and autumn. I think it will be a great picture to take. Don't forget to rent Hanbok (Korean traditional dress)"
188,5.0,"The place is really big, was there just as the guards switched and was very nice. Most Korean wore traditional clothing which was nice too. Would definitely recommend a visit when you’re in Seoul."
189,3.0,"It is hard to be impress by the palace if you have been to China. Those are bigger, more grand and more historically significant than the ones in Seoul. There is a lot of empty spaces with just sands and normal trees. Very little historical information are given and the whole place just feel souless. Better off to visit the national museum nearby. You can also see many people dressed in Korean hanbok but I find it gimmicky, you do received free entrance if you do that as well. It is one of those places you go so you can said I been there."
190,4.0,Buildings are awesome and is one of the top attractions in Seoul. It;s kind a similar to Changdeokgung Palace. It;s huge and is amazing.
191,4.0,"Visited as part of a half-day, multi-site tour. Visiting the palace and watching the changing guards ceremony was definitely one of the highlights. My trip was in early March so we did not get to see the cherry blossoms, but if you visit during the warmer months you will get to experience the blooming season and capture excellent photos and memories."
192,5.0,"It was my first encounter with this kind of architecture and I was thoroughly impressed. I lost my bonnet while I was walking the grounds and lost&found wasn’t very helpful, but it didn’t dim my wonder with the place. You can walk around the buildings at your own pace, and if you are wearing the national custom, entrance is free (you will see dressed up girls everywhere, another delight!). Not that it’s expensive otherwise - I think it’s about 2 or 3 US dollars. I wasn’t there in time for the free tours and I feel I would have loved it even more if I had taken one; for someone who knows very little about Seoul or even Korea, most of the context is lost. In any case, it was a wonderful way to pass the time (stayed there about one hour and a half) and I would come back any time :)"
193,5.0,"If you have been to the Forbidden City in Beijing, you will be more tolerant of this rebuilt collection of buildings that is the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Some reviewers complain there isn't much to see here. But I guess it depends upon what your goals are.Yes, the buildings are mostly closed or empty. But the way the palace is built with exposure to weather with unheated buildings, it is understandable why they won't be full of ancient artifacts. You'll find those in museums nearby. I have been here probably five times going back over 30 years, and I never cease to find it a place to calmly reflect on Korea's ancient and interesting history as a keystone located in the heart of East Asia. Additionally, you will find two great museums within its boundary. A great place for leisurely walks and quiet thinking (except on Korean holidays!)."
194,2.0,I visited this palace today. Wow - how boring can a palace be! This one takes the biscuit!! Lots of Koreans all garbed up in traditional Korean dress which they hire locally - even men so they get free admission. Selfies are the order of the day. We maybe just a bit of glamour. Let's get down to hard facts. Lots of buildings - most closed with nothing to see. Those open / nothing inside - again empty rooms - nothing to see. Exceptions: the throne room has a throne in - basic and the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion is of national significance for its important part in architectural design and application. This is not a place to visit even if it only costs 4000 won. The National Palace Museum of Korea is in the same compound (admission free) is excellent. So head there when disillusionment overcomes you from your Palace experience.
195,5.0,"My mom loves korean movies. Specially old historical movies. It felt i was walking in one of their scenes. Interesting palace. I wish i was there in spring time, i am sure with all the trees and flowers would have looked marvelous"
196,5.0,Great place to spend and hour or so looking around. Very beautiful in every season even in the rain. Highly recommend spending a day looking at all the palaces in Seoul!
197,4.0,Best palace in Seoul. Really beautiful. The entrance is 3000w. Worth the visit and there are no queues.
198,5.0,This place is really huge and I was amazed by the structures being preserved up to this time. Witness the changing of guards and a lot at least 1-2hrs when visiting. This is a must visit place in Seoul!! This is totally worth it.
199,5.0,"I absolutely recommend you to join the free guided groups (every 1-2 h). As well, I went in a morning of a workday, so no pretty crowded. You can also buy Palace Pass (10 000 W) for 4 palaces, which makes sense as the ticket here is 3 000 W for all (no student discount). My advice: eat well before going, no shops on the territory, and take comfortable shoes and warm clothes as you will be walking 2-3 hours."
200,5.0,"The entrance fee is only about 3,000 won but free on holidays, and it is excellent! There are free tours in English, and you can walk the grounds with a group or wander free. It's a beautiful palace and at the center of Seoul. Highly recommend!"
201,5.0,"it is near the Anguk station on the brown line, few hundred meters away! Pro-tip go on a weekend cause it is usually free that time and go early so that you could still take your photos in peace away from thousands of tourists."
202,5.0,"This is an amazing palace and grounds - and way bigger than expected from the outside. You can get some great photos of the spectacular architecture against the cityscape, as well as the visitors in traditional Hanbok dress. I arrived just before the changing of the guard at 2 pm, which you shouldn’t miss. It’s quite a show, with military pomp, drums and uniforms. Kids would probably love it.I took a free Seoul Walking Tour around the palace, which is a great option to get the most out of the experience. There is a lot of history that one might not get without a guide."
203,4.0,Its free entry inside the palace if you wear the traditional hanbok. Otherwise changing of guards and walking around the palace is free too. Lots of photogenic places. Hanbok rentals are mostly at bukchan hanok area across the street and up. Loads of variety of price and time limit. So ask first before purchasing. Trustworthy enough to keep your coats with them remember to bring along your wallet and phone and camera on a handbag rented by them.
204,5.0,"Start pestering the guards on duty. Their traditional silk garbs are photogenic. The palace grounds are beautiful. This time, it snowed. It was beautiful. A must do in Seoul."
205,3.0,"This is probably the ""best"" palace to look at. But beware that you're only looking at the outside of a lot of buildings that to the untrained eye look very similar to one another. It's not like visiting Versailles or a UK palace where you get to walk around inside and see how people really lived. That said, it's a slice of history, you can admire the architecture and appreciate the sheer scale of the royal residence. The changing of the guard ceremony is well worth watching - the highlight of my visit"
206,5.0,"Was the first royal palace built in the Joseon Dynasty. Is the largets of the 5 palaces remaining in Seoul. You have to pay around 3,000 Wons per  Adult and foreigners under  18 years old can enter for free. This palace is close on Tuesdays. Changing of the Royal Guard Ceremony twice daily. Is a beautiful and incredible place to visit, the colors are incredible you can learn a lot of this beautiful culture and country. Every time i go to seoul i love to visit it."
207,5.0,This place is huge! My feet got tired just walking around this place and didnt have the energy to go to another palace. There are shops nearby where you can rent hanbok so better to rentone before going around to take photos :)
208,4.0,"This palace is the biggest among the other 5 palaces in Seoul. It is huge and grand and a great way to spend a relaxing morning. The palace buildings are beautifully restored and its granduer really impressed me. You can easily spend 4 hours just looking at every nook and cranny. Do allocate some time to watch the changing of guards at the main Gwanghwamun gate. Do not rush through this attraction as you sit down at the many seats provided to just watch the relaxing scenery.National Folk Museum of Korea is also situated in the Palace's ground. I was able to enter the museum FOC with the Palace ticket.With such a big ground to cover and a museum to visit, do wear comfortable walking shoes, bring drinking water and your camera. I believe you will enjoy your visit as much as I did."
209,5.0,"Visited here during the month of September 2017. Its a must see palace if you are visiting Seoul. It's quite a big palace and will take you around 2 hrs to cover it fully. The palace has an entry fee of 3000 Korean won. There is also another ticket which cover 5 palaces and valod for a month I guess, buying that ticket will get you a good deal if you are planning to visit all palaces.Also the guards changing ceremony is the one which everyone looks forward for.As I remember it starts at 2. So be there in time to witnesses it.After the ceremony you can also get pictures clicked besides the guards.Also around the palace you will find shop's were you can rent the traditional Korean attire and visit the palace in that attire."
210,5.0,Well maintained palace. Only 3000 won per entry! You can always buy the integrated tickets so that you can enter 3 palaces and 1 shrines with one price!
211,5.0,Amazing place and lots to see.The guard ceremony is not to be missed at the gate followed by the free tour. Guide was knowledgeable and interacted with the group to make the hour plus walking interactive and interesting.Station right at the front of the park makes getting there and back again easy.There early January and was a fresh minus 4 outside plus a bit of cooling wind. Rug up with some good warm clothes for the hour or so of walking the grounds.Well worth a few hours to go and see.
212,5.0,"What a pleasant visit! Let me just start saying how nice Seoul and it's people are. As a solo tourist I had to ask for assistance every now and then. About Gyeongbokgung, it is a lovely palace full of history of the Joseon Dynasty. I was approached by a high school tour guide who offered me her services as a guide of the Gyeongbokgung palace as an opportunity for her to speak English. She showed me the palace grounds, explained about life during the dynasty. Interesting to think how the empress life was lonely and how she would never leave the palace again, even after the wasn't the empress anymore.  The palace is beautiful in its simplicity. Totally worth a visit."
213,3.0,"Although there are many tourist, the palace grounds are large enough for everyone to walk around in. I didn't find the palace very interesting, but i did enjoy the changing of the guards ceremony."
214,4.0,Bought as a half day tour. The changing of the guard was totally worth it. Get there early if you want the best seat. The palace is large and the foliage around the palace is gorgeous during Autumn.
215,5.0,Go on Saturdays to enjoy plays at the museum inside the temples. It would be nice to have a guide to explain the history of each building.
216,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung palace, the obvious seat of government in older times, is a showpiece for the city, staring down at the city's main avenue through the reconstructed Gwanghwamun gate, giving it the proper sightlines so important in eastern palace layouts. Seen from the outside from the newly built pedestrian center area of that avenue, the gate and palace grounds are nicely framed by a backdrop of green mountains.Being the main palace in Seoul, it features a number of displays, including performers in traditional dress showing various aspect of court pageantry. Also worth visiting is the folk museum within.The buildings are predictable large and ornate, and more geometrically laid out than at other palaces. The detailing and shape of the roofs are unique, and the large number of carved stone figures, some of them unfortunately encased in transparent boxes due to unruly visitors, interesting indeed. As usual in such palaces, the women's sleeping quarters have a more livable look to them.Maintenance and upkeep are very good, reflective of the country's current prosperity."
217,5.0,"Must visit when in Seoul. Buy ticket pass to enjoy this palace and the other three, Changdeokgung, Deoksugung, Changgyeonggung. I came when Chuseok and it's free entry. Visit Jongmyo shrine too."
218,4.0,Good place to visit and take pictures. The weather wasn't too cold when I travelled so was very enjoyable.
219,3.0,"A big part of the palace is closed for renovation right now. So it might be worth going again, but in the current state, it's a pretty large palace and a nice promenade, not much else."
220,5.0,"Being a fan of kdrama, I have watched several period drama where the plot is in  Josean era. Gyeongbokgung palace reminds me of these drama and it gave me a lot of goosebumps. But take note that this palace is closed every Tuesday so plan your trip and consider their operation days."
221,5.0,"Very nice to visit. I visited during a long lay over. Would recommend to do same.Extremely traditional and picture perfect.Exactly what you expect when in Seoul. Also, as opposed to my normal dealings, I bought some very nice souvenirs in the souvenir shop."
222,5.0,"Worth checking out. Palace, although smaller than the Forbidden City, was still quite large. Was nice to walk through it and see all the fall colours. Be sure to check out the elevated pagoda thing by the pond in the middle. The view of the mountains is also very nice when you walk further Northwest. You can't see inside many buildings though so you don't really need to walk through it all. You won't miss much if you don't, save the view."
223,4.0,The place is known for being a tourist spot. I am not a big fan of palaces so for me the place was OK. However the place gives a very good insight on the Korean culture
224,4.0,"One of Seoul’s place to see, lots of tourist and it is the biggest of the Palaces but it is not all finish yet lots of restoration being done as of now!"
225,4.0,"This is on top of the 5-palace tour and a scheduled concert on the grounds makes it a must see. You literally walk along paths of Korea’s history and admire its architecture. There are English tours but if you have read its history and armed with a map of the grounds, you can do the tour on your own. It is a bit of a walk and some cobbled stones may be hard for some so wear comfortable and decent clothes, or wear traditional Hanbok for instagrammable photos and you get in free. If you have the time to tour at least 3 palaces then get the combination ticket, you will save a lot."
226,4.0,I very much enjoyed walking around this palace on a sunny cold morning! It took me 3hours ish to wander around and take it all in. It was very peaceful and although it was only rebuilt recently I feel they have tried to keep it as traditional as possible. Don’t miss out walking down the west side past all the trees! They were looking so beautifully this time of year. I enjoyed watching all the korean people in the traditional dress running around and taking photos. Such a sweet thing to see! 😊
227,4.0,Fair warning the palace is huge. Lots of photo taking opportunities especially if you're into renting the traditional costumes. There are several opportunities to catch actors reenacting scenes of the king and queen moving around with their entourage. Also the change of guard ceremony really brings you back in time. Found the best time to take pictures is just before closing. You'll have 30mins to an hour to yourself to grab some good shots without a tourist walking into your frame.
228,5.0,Nice historical palace in Seoul you will enjoy typical Korean architecture and history with lovely style and colors
229,4.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is very large and it’s a pleasant walk around the structures and green spaces. To get there, get off at the Gyeongbokgung station (metro/bus) its 2 blocks away/ 5 min walk to the palace, some buses may take you just in front of the palace but check your route for details. Maybe before or after your visit you may enjoy a lunch at Tosokchon Samgyetang (opens at 10:30) only a short walk away, they are known for their ginger chicken soup but expect long lines after 12 noon. I didn't think there was a lot to see but architecture and the cultural value is worth a visit. You can try to be at the front entrance for the changing of the guard at 11:00 and 13:00 (free). I must warn you the changing of the guard is more of a reenactment and is a bit “cheesy” as the guards are more actors than real guards, they're pictures ops for tourists, the fake beards doesn't help. I would think as part of the job they would have to have a real one. If you want to go inside go to the right pass the entrance to get a ticket, 3000w/pp. I recommend making your way up to the National Folk Museum of Korea and exit the palace by the gates just below. That exit gate is only a short walk to the Bukchon Hanok Village."
230,4.0,"We were able to watch the exchange of guards in the palace at 1pm, the ceremony lasted for 10 minutes. They use big drums and old flutes before the guards do their marching."
231,5.0,"This palace is really beautiful and really huge. Even though there was a lot of people, you can just turn a corner and found out you are alone in this place filled with history. Do take the guided tour although my tour guide was not really that good. After that, do take your own time exploring the palace. The gardens are especially gorgeous during the autumn season. Do not miss the guard changing ceremony."
232,5.0,Went at the right time so managed to have a glimpse of the guard-changing ceremony! I rented the audio guide and it was really helpful!
233,4.0,With splendid palaces and pagodas donning this palace one is taken back in time as one strolls through this complex. The best part of the visit is the traditional guard changing ceremony! And one can get clicked with them once they have taken their place. Would be even better if one can get a hanbok to move around and have that authentic feel.
234,4.0,"The nearest metro station is Gyeongbukgung Station on Line 3.This Palace is an impressive set of buildings. It was built three years after the founding of the Joseon Dynasty. It has an interesting history. It was destroyed during the Japanese invasion in the 16th century. It was rebuilt in 1867. It was again destroyed by Japanese occupation in 1915 and replaced with the headquarters of the Japanese government. The present Korean government has embarked on an ambitious restoration project started in 1990 to bring the palace to its former glory. The backdrop to the palace is Mount Bugak. The main entrance to the palace is through Gwanghwamun Gate. There is a colourful changing of the guard ceremony held every morning.  Within the grounds are the National Folk Museum of Korea and the National Palace Museum of Korea. Also, the offices of the King and the Korean state officials are located within the outer court of the palace walls. The inner court has the residences for the royal family. The Queen’s palace and the Crown Prince’s palaces are within the main Gyeongbokgung palace.Admission for adults are 3,000 Won (equivalent to about GBP2.00 Aug 2017).In the summer months of June, July and August, the opening hours are 9am to 6.30pm – and the last admission is one hour before closing time. It is closed on TuesdaysThere are facilities for the disabled like free wheelchair rental, parking access, ramps and toilets."
235,5.0,"Good view /big place/easy to find/wonderful place /i think ,,u should come to there everything is good"
236,5.0,A must visit sight in Seoul. Extensive buildings of restored royal palace. Changing of the guard is touristy fun. Very little inside the halls except for one exhibition.
237,5.0,"This Palace is a must visit, especially for those visiting Seoul for the first time. The palace grounds are wide and spacious, so it may take up to a half day to explore this historical site. You will just be awed at the design and colours of the place. The weather can be very hot in October, so make sure you bring your sunnies and water bottle. I took a lot of pictures, can’t get enough of the place, but of course the pictures are unable to demonstrate the beauty and atmosphere of the place. So, must really go visit it!"
238,5.0,"This is a lovely, well maintained palace with lots to see.  The grounds are also well maintained and the pond with the pagoda in the middle is a nice view to look at while relaxing and taking in the scenery."
239,4.0,I underestimated the size of this place and it took me much longer to see the place than I thought.  I made sure to arrive in time to see the changing of the guard ceremony.
240,5.0,"Highly recommended to visit this place!Entry for an individual is 3,000 Korean Won (AED 9/ $2). You can either walk the entire place yourself and take time to read the descriptions, or you can catch a free tour (10 people at a time) and they provide guides of different languages (Eng, Jap, Chinese & Korean) just check for timings. Recommeded to go as early as 10AM before the school trips & tour trips come over and over crowd the place!The amount of history in this place is amazing, clean & quite frankly can be a maze!"
241,4.0,The palace is a vast place to cover. You have to walk a lot to see the sprawling palace and other places located. There is an entry fee. But it is worth the money. You can easily spend around 3 to 4 hours.
242,4.0,"Since I visited this during Chuseok holiday, it quite crowded and difficult to get nice shot but good thing to compesate that is free entrance. I spent hours admiring their fine art and cant believe this palace so old but still majestic. I figured out lot of entrance to the palace, you can walk from bukchon hanok village, or from dongdaemon or take a subway and stop at jongno-3-ga and walk. Many ways at our convenient."
243,5.0,I visited Gyeongbokgung Palace with a tour guide in a group. The palace is very big with many buildings and we took lots of photos with the palace in the background. I recommend this place for anyone visiting Seoul.
244,4.0,"Possibly the largest of the five main palaces in the centre of Seoul, Gyeongbokgung has a lot to see, but it's all rather 'samey'. The original palace is long gone and like the other four, this is a recreation that was redone in 2007. It's hard to imagine the original palaces were as drab and austere as the recreations, but I definitely don't believe they all had exactly the same brickwork, exactly the same woodwork and all had exactly the same paint jobs. The result is that as you wander around, you just see the same thing over and over. Like all the other palaces, you cannot enter any of the buildings. Two of the largest buildings have open doors so you can see inside, but that's as close as you get. The Hyangwonjeong Pavilion is completely closed for renovation as of October 2017 and you can only visit the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion if you have pre-booked (and presumably paid a separate fee). Make sure you buy the Palace Pass for W10,000 as that will give you a big discount on the five palaces and the shrine that it covers. If you turn up in traditional Korean clothing, you get in free (that's true of all the palaces). However, since you have to pay W10,000 for four hours to rent the costume, it's no saving at all."
245,5.0,Came here on the tour provided from the airport during a layover. The architecture is just amazing. Photos don't capture just how grand it really is to stand under these amazing buildings. Enjoyed the changing of the guard ceremony. Since this was part of a larger tour we only had about an hour to see the front area and chamber. As I understand it there was much more to see that we just didn't have time for. ideal plan to spend 2-3 (maybe more depending on your stamina and interest level). Enjoy a beautiful picnic. There was a fee to enter but since it was included in the tour price I am not sure how much it was. Enjoy!
246,3.0,"Had very high expectations of this based on rave reviews on Trip Advisor.  But was underwhelmed.  It's decent enough.  In good condition and some nice architecture, but I guess I've been spoiled with the Forbidden City.Usually 3000 KRW entry but was free for holiday. Checkout the men in traditional uniform.  Great for a pic.  Multiple entry gates. Not many bathrooms Always busy"
247,5.0,Must see piece of Korean cultural history for any tourists in Seoul! Free admission and musuems attatched to the palace grounds.
248,5.0,Crowded but worth it. You can spend just and hour and see the highlights or go slow and spend hours just experiencing history.Go early in the day to avoid some crowds.
249,5.0,"Here is one of the must-visit places in Seoul. It is well organized for visitors with resting places, guidance signs and free guided tours. Dedicate at least half day. Area is quite big including several palaces for royal dynasty of Korea."
250,5.0,"beautiful place. took me a long time to actually get there but it was great. the grounds are so pretty. standard entry is 3,000₩ (free if you wear a hanbok so you'll likely see lots of ppl running around in them which is cool) as you walk further into the palace you can see the mountains and if you look back you'll see the city which is like the most seoul thing ever.they serve tea in the library and other drinks in the cafe/souvenir shop (most upwards of 5,000₩). i finally got there at almost 11 -quite busy, the grounds are big though so getting shots without other people is possible. i put it into my itinerary as a quick morning activity and didn't end up leaving until just after noon so make the time if you're the type to want to explore every corner of a place, it really is huge."
251,5.0,"This temple is the best in Seoul, SK. Entrance is only $3,000W like $3usd. There is so much to do inside the place. There is also a museum and a few other shrines. This was my favourite spot in Seoul. Make sure you go there early because it gets packed so it is tough to take pics without people around. This is a MUST."
252,3.0,"Arrived after an interesting Subway ride, this is a vast complex take your time enjoy it. my expectation was alot higher based on the Photos I had seen previously. Still Interesting worth a visit"
253,3.0,"This palace was nice to see for historical reasons, but it is not impressive after you have seen the Forbidden City. It is similar, but smaller and less appointed. Enjoy the extras they have at different times, like shows, teas, and such."
254,5.0,This is o must to see in Seoul very nice Palace.. take you time to Walk around in the Palace 1.5 hour is Good
255,5.0,"Entering the Palace grounds is deceptive - it is really a large complex and you could spend a good deal of time exploring the buildings. You can rent a hanbok & venture into this palace, like it was Joseon period. The architectural details are beautiful. Love the to sit beside a lake & relax."
256,5.0,"It is a wonderful historic site and is quite big so make sure to take water and comfy shoes. You also have free access to a museum that is inside the compound. Its a great day time activity, right in the middle of the city."
257,5.0,"I've been to Korea over and over, and I always ended up here, because they always have many festivals held in the palace. It's beautiful during spring, autumn and winter. If you are wearing hanbok (Korean traditional clothe) then you get free admission to enter the palace."
258,4.0,Free tours in various languages are given throughout the day once you go inside. Entrance free is very cheap.
259,5.0,"Very Interesting to understand how the medieval koreans lived. Also it shows how well preserved the palace has been kept. Its really cool to see the inner infrastructure of the rooms and quarters that the King , Queen and the maids lived in. The palace is massive and not really recommended for elderly and disabled tourists. It is definitely worth a go if you live around the area ! Its my second time here and would love to go again !"
260,4.0,"This palace is closed on Tuesdays and costs W3000, unless you are 65 or over in which case entry is free.A visit will last 1-2 hours depending on how much you want to see.Free guided tours in English are available at specific times. Otherwise it is self-guided. There are notices in English but not everything is explained.It is the biggest of the palaces in Seoul and has been much restored after having destroyed by fire, neglected or damaged by others during the 600 years since the oldest parts were built.The buildings are set within lovely grounds and flower beds. There are two pavilions set within ponds which are particularly scenic.Only downside is the small print in the information leaflet!The palace is next to the National Palace Museum of Korea.A must see in Seoul. Though note that many buildings are not lavishly furnished."
261,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is probably one of the more interesting of all in Korea.  If you can, try planning to go on the last Wednesday of the month as admission to most palace and museums are free.  Also, in Seoul, they do free tours.  However, you need to make reservations at least 48 hours beforehand.  So, make sure to do your research before visiting the country.  Gyeongbokgung Palace is cool in so many aspects, particularly the guard change every hour.  In addition, men can also try out guard uniforms free of charge, in which you can walk within a specific area for 5-10 mins to take pictures."
262,5.0,"Having visited both, I would recommend Gyeongbokgung over Changdeokgung. The architecture is about the same at either palace, but I personally think Gyeongbokgung's mountainous backdrop is more breathtaking than Changdeokgung's secret garden (which I thought was overrated).Try to visit during an off-peak time to avoid the crowds. I visited around 3 pm on a drizzly weekday afternoon and found the palace to be wonderfully uncrowded. The free English tour was a nice way to learn more about Korean history, but I also recommend taking the time to explore some of the more remote areas of the palace--the buildings are just as nicely restored and most people don't bother to walk that far in so it felt like I had the whole place to myself."
263,4.0,"spare sometime if you want to throughly walk around the place. it can be overwhelming, but there's a free 30-minutes tour in english. look for schedule near the entrance from gwanghamun gate. personally i'm happy with just that, then spend more time in other palaces like changdeokgung (within walking distance from gyeongbukgung) which has prettier garden and pavilions in my opinion."
264,5.0,"It was a great experience - learning about the rich history and culture, and different dynasties in Korea's history such as Goryeo to Joseon periods, understanding the early Chinese & Japanese influence and development of the Korean alphabet and language. It all helps to someone like me who also appreciate Korean period dramas. The changing of guards performance was colorful and interesting. It's a huge place so alot of walking is required. I was glad that the weather was perfect that morning - cool and slightly windy. I also made the right decision to join a guided tour and was rewarded with a pleasant and patient tour guide who not only speaks English well but has a great understanding of Korean history. All said, I had enjoyed the tour tremendously and would certainly recommend it !"
265,4.0,"Similar in style to other Seoul palaces, Gyeongbokgung differs in size and the extensive complex of palace buildings and compounds. There is much to see here so it is best to allow at least two hours to explore. I recommend entering through the main gate and exiting at the rear of the grounds to ensure you don't miss the beautiful book room and final home complex of the revered empress. The walk back from the rear of the grounds takes you past a number of small art galleries. Avoid the weekend if possible as there are many tour groups."
266,5.0,"Very nice place in the middle of the city. It is a well preserved and maintained piece of history. There are lots of tourists here, but due to the size it's still nice."
267,5.0,"I really enjoyed going to Gyeongbokgung. I actually met up with a friend there that I had met on a language exchange app but never met in real life, and we had so much fun! Because that friend insisted on paying for my ticket for me, I don't actually know how much it costs. But I found out from people there that if you go to one of the Hanbok (traditional Korean clothing) stores nearby and pay to rent Hanbok (which you can do, prices vary depending on the outfit you choose and how long you want to borrow it, I borrowed the ""cheap"" outfit for 2 hours and it was 20,000 Won (~$20)) you can enter the palace for free. So it was quite cool, as we walked around the palace, there were people everywhere wearing the traditional Korean palace clothing! Bless their hearts though, that day was HOT. If you come to the palace in the summer, be prepared for that... I was not... lol. Overall it's a gorgeous place to visit and a lovely walk during the day. There's a mini museum/cafe/information center/gift shop near the main building of the palace, so you can go there and enjoy some A/C if you're dying in the heat (like I was). There are also a lot of cute cafes and restaurants nearby that you can go to, with delicious food! Overall, I would recommend visiting this palace, but it's more fun if you go with a friend or a group for sure. :)"
268,5.0,"I enjoyed learning about dynasties, intrigues in the palace and architecture. Secret Garden tour is beautiful and interesting as well."
269,3.0,"It is a large complex, like a big park, with several buildings. You need at least 2 hours to go through them all and in the severe heat of the summer, it is quite exhausting. The buildings all look more or less alike. The main building is supposed to be the Gyoenghoeru Pavillion, which is not impressive. Very little or no information is given, at least not in English, which is shameful. However, this is the largest palace in Seoul and the complex is the most important tourist attraction ao it is a must see."
270,5.0,"It would take at least a couple of hours on a moderate pace to go around the complex. It also makes one think how patriotic the South Koreans are, looking at groups and families whiling away a beautiful afternoon in the rain."
271,4.0,"Massive-would be my first reaction to this place. It is a place that you should visit in Seoul to appreciate some histories, traditional Korean architecture and garden. There were a lot of tourists there but the place is so spread out so you won't feel that it's too cramped in there. ( at least the day I was there ). Prepare to spend about 2 hours if you would like to walk it all. There is locker area near the main gate but I recommend taking your belonging with you because there are other gates that you can exit as you walk deeper into the property. And from those gate you can easily walk to other attractions. In summer, bring along umbrella and water."
272,4.0,Very easy to get to and very reasonable entrance fee. I went to see the changing of the guard...which got rained out but it's a nice place to see history in the heart of the city.
273,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is one of the most iconic sights in all of Korea because of its long and storied history. Completed in 1395 at the beginning of the Joseon Dynasty. It's is the largest and the most scenic because with Mount Bugaksan and Mount Namsan. Free guided tours in English at 1100, 1300 and 1500. Don't miss the Changing of the Guard Ceremony at 1000 and 1300. Entrance Fee is 3,000 won. Do expect at least 1-2 hours to roam around the compound. The National Palace Museum of Korea is located South of Heungnyemun Gate and National Folk Museum is located on the eastern side. You can reach the Palace by taking Subway Line 3 to Gyeongbokgung Station Exit 5 or Line 3 Anguk Station Exit 1."
274,3.0,"This was very disappointing and says a lot about major sights in Korea and China. Extremely grand and a wonderful photo opportunity as you will see many people using it. Unfortunately there is no content or real history here. The temple is completely gutted and the buildings become very samey, very quickly.A nice walk but not much to see or learn here."
275,5.0,"This palace is extraordinary!  What a beauty.  I was amazed how big this place is when I got in.  There's a lot to see.  I'm Korean, so I'm very proud at the fact that my ancestors built this palace.  It's definitely a must see when you are in Seoul.  Don't leave without seeing this place!"
276,5.0,"Amazing palace grounds with a vaierty of temples, which reminded me of a smaller version of the Forbidden City in Beijing.  Tip:  Get there when it opens at 9:  no crowds and the weather cooler."
277,5.0,"I really enjoyed my time in this beautiful place. Entrance fee is 3000 kwn, if you want you can get a free English tour (11.am., 3.30pm) There are also Korean national dresses for rent, you can rent it out and stay your visit wearing this dress. It reminds me at some point forbidden city in Beijing but with way more greenery, beautiful ponds, less people and way more space. If you like museums don't forget to pass by national folk museum, it's right next to the palace."
278,3.0,Just what's it says it is. A large palace with interesting architecture. Be sure to time your visit for the changing of the guard
279,5.0,"I had only one day in Seoul that time and I wanted to visit something, which represents the city and Korean culture. I chose the Gyeongbokgug Palace. I was lucky as they have free entrance on the last Wednesday of the month. It was a nice surprise! The palace is magnigicent! Of course, it is better to know more about it history, but even if you don't, it is a nice place to walk and discover, to forget all the troubles and just walk and enjoy the beauty of pavillions. There were many young people in national dresses, it gives this place even more magic and brings you somewhere centuries ago."
280,3.0,"Nice to see, shows but bring cash If you want to se the Hole area. Good food in the restaurant and good service"
281,5.0,"I arrived in time for the changing of the guards. What an amazing spectacle with a parade of guards in their colourful Korean uniforms, marching in formation carryingdifferent  coloured flags that fluttered in the breeze. Then the main event of horns and conchs being played as a a parade of guards filled the forecourt for the change over.Definitely a unique ceremony not to be missed. I spent a number of hours exploring the Palace which has many buildings, each different and the lovely gardens. Was a real pleasure to see many Koreans dressed in traditional Hanbok clothing that added to the ambience of the Palace. So many photo opportunities particularly of the architecture and the backdrop of the mountains behind. A highlight of my Korean visit."
282,5.0,"like the title, this is one of my favorite place in seoul. its beautiful throghout four seasons,,  nice to walk around.  They open at night two times a year. Spring and Fall about two weeks each. The entrance ticket sold out like in one minute for night entrance, but if u r foreigner they have extra ticket available at site. so much more possibility to enter. special lights makes the palace extraordinary . must try!"
283,5.0,"Went here on a hot day in June.  It was pretty cool to see.  I'm by no means a history buff or even that into cultural things, but I can appreciate the history of this palace.  I think its a must-see if you're in Seoul!"
284,5.0,"We rented the hanbok (the traditional outfit) and walked around the palace.  It felt like you were part of a Korean drama.  It was fun and the place is surprisingly huge, so were your comfortable shoes."
285,5.0,"To learn the history (even it is related to recent 600 years only)and King's life, it is highly recommended to visit this palace."
286,4.0,"I don’t want to miss Gyeongbokgung Palace because it is the oldest and largest Seoul’s palace. The entrance fee is only 3,000 won but if you want to experience wearing Hanbok or Traditional dress you can rent for 30,000won + you can get a free entry discount. One more thing, don’t miss to watch the Royal Guard Changing Ceremonies. It is a great opportunity to experience a rare traditional scene in Korea."
287,5.0,"This is a huge palace that has been restored by a fire in the past. If you exit from the train station Gwanghwamun, you will be awed by a huge golden statue of King Sejong placed in the square outside the palace gate. Turn around and you will see the statue of a soldier guarding the whole place.The admission cost KRW3000. You could get to witness the Change of Guards ceremony at a certain time.Take your time to explore the splendour and architecture."
288,5.0,"In the morning you can view the changing of the guards, then you can walk around the site and imagine yourself back then."
289,5.0,"This palace is one of many, but only one must to see. Plan to use half of day to move around and get inspired by great culture. Best time to visit is outside summer months since it's quite hot and crowded this period. Easy to get there by subway since it's located just downtown if city. After that can connect with leisure walking around the city."
290,4.0,"Must see place to visit allow a couple of hours here to take in the culture, history and wander around exploring. The guards at the front seem to be more a tourist attraction with their stick on beards and more a part time job than others I have seen in London etc. Don't let this put you off thou as once inside you get to see and learn about the history of Gyeongbokgung Palace. Do make sure you take the free tour lasting just over an hour will give you a good insight into its history and best of all it is free, if you dress traditionally thou it is free entry, great to see so many doing it certainly adds to the atmosphere. Like most places in Seoul it was cheap admission and certainly worth the cost."
291,5.0,"This place is really busy at times, that busy that it is hard to get a good photo, it is pretty big to so make sure you have good walking shoes on and take water, you can not miss the changing of the guards at 11am 1pm and 3pm it good to watch."
292,5.0,"If you are a history buff, I recommend doing a guided tour. There is plenty of history to be explored. I recommend watching the change of guard."
293,5.0,A glance into Korean history. Super huge and pretty palace. It was once damaged during japanese invasion period but it was rebuilt..
