1,3.0,Shortest way to reach namsan park or tower is to use the cable car. It's a short ride to the top of the hill.
2,4.0,We thought the easiest and most fun way of getting to the top of the hill and the tower! They do cram you in but it’s ok you can still move at least to bring your arms up to take a photo. The views are cool enough. They have windows just around the top half of the car.
3,4.0,"Gone up and down the hill by cable car. They charge a small fee to use it which was all acceptable. We booked a return so we could also get back down. The cabin was not air conditioned and they stuff quite a lot of ppl into the cabin. But it’s only a 3 min ride. We didn’t have to Quere please note this. Up the hill there are love locks - like the ones in Paris where u can leave a message and then seal it at the fence. Nice idea . You can Bring your pwn lock or buy one locally. You find the tower, food and drinks nice views over the city and some shows up there. Well worth the visit!Definitely recommend!!"
4,3.0,The distance of boarding to the nearest metro station is far. You will need to walk up hill.They will squeeze everybody in one car. Literally pack. There wont be enough space to even take pictures.
5,4.0,Firstly is to enjoy the city view of Myeongdong city - take a free slanted lift from ground to Cable Car station (foot of Namsan)Slanted lift station is about 8~10 minutes walk from Myeongdong station.Secondly is the mid~high view of colourful forest along the ride in Cable Car.Thirdly is from the highest view on Namsam.It’s also recommended to take stairs from cable car station (foot of Namsam) to ground... Enjoy the last beautiful scene under fresh air in the city ^ ^
6,4.0,"We got the cable car to the top of Namsan. We walked from the Myeongdong metro station & there were plenty of street signs that pointed the way to the cable car. We got there at 9:55am, bought our tickets and were on the first cable car at 10:00am. Definitely recommend going at opening time to beat the queue. The cable car has good views, it's a convenient way to get up the mountain and we're glad we did it, but it's not a must-see attraction like the peak tram in Hong Kong."
7,3.0,"Namsan Cable Car is the easiest and fastest way for you to visit N Seoul Tower. It is located 10 to 20 minutes walk away from Myeongdong area and the ticket is quite affordable at 8,500 won for adult return trip.The cable car journey however is short, at around 10 minutes journey if I am not mistaken and takes you straight to the foot of N Seoul Tower. Quite a seamless experience but do take note that the cable car is not operational during bad weather. Nothing really special except as a convenient way to visit Seoul Tower and Namsan Park."
8,3.0,"Namsan cable car is the best way to get to tje Namsan seoul tower if you do not want to get tired. A round trip fare of 8,500kw for adult and 5,500 for kids and 6,000 for single journey. See picture for reference. If you are going to try this on holidays, you will experience a long time of waiting for the ride. We tried it during childrens day and we waited for about 1 hour. Probably if it is not holiday or weekend, only few people will ride. About 3 or 4 min of ride and you will enjoy the cable car and the beautiful view of seoul."
9,3.0,Took the cable car going up to N Seoul Tower. We were greeted with long lines. Rode the bus on our way back to Myeongdong which was easier. Don’t get the round trip tickets and take the bus on your way down.
10,4.0,We arrived soon after they opened and had no wait to get in a cable car.  For 8500 you get a return ride.  Which on a cold spring day seemed more appealing than walking!   Worth it if there is no wait.  However on a warmer day I would walk the gentle slopes.
11,2.0,"High price, long queue (often in the elements) and then crammed on to the vehicle worrying if the weight limit is exceeded, not my idea of a fun tourist attraction. They even charge a premium for car parking."
12,4.0,"Our accommodation was just a short walk from the Cable Car.  We got there and it was  long wait, 40 minutes, slowly progressing in the queue.  There were time estimates provided when you first purchased tickets, so we were happy enough with that, to wait is an informed decision!Good views from the cable car at night.  When you've walked all day, the cable car is the sensible option for getting to the Tower."
13,5.0,"It's very connivence to have a better opion rather than walking the whole way beside it's very cheap( 6,700 won) per adult which is about 7 dollars consider the experience. The only thing we disliked is that the ""Cart"" location itself, it's pretty far to walk to there from the subway station but despite that the service is very good."
14,4.0,"We took the Namsan Cable Car to N Seoul Tower.  It was a bit of a walk from Myeongdong Station.  Upon Seeing Price Hotel, we took the most direct route there."
15,3.0,i bought the round trip ticket for 2 person. It was a good view when heading to N tower. Good for take it especially when winter time.
16,3.0,"We visited on a late afternoon in Fall and the queue to purchase tickets was at least 1hr long and then another 30-45min to board the cable car which lasted less than 5min. So we decided to come back in the morning at 11am and lo and behold, there was no queue for boarding the cable car. There were only 2-3 cable cars in operation due to the short distance.Tickets purchase-able for the cable car has several different combinations such as return tickets, or tickets with meals at the italian restaurant etc.Also note that if visiting with the intention of riding the outdoor elevator to the cable car station form street level, the elevator is shut on Mondays and queues can get up to 45min wait. The alternate walk/climb from street level to cable car station is not that exhausting if taken at a relaxed pace. The climb is only 10-15min to get to the cable car station.Alternative method to get up to Namsan is hike or taxi."
17,5.0,"Very cool way to go to N Seoul tower. The ride isn’t very long, and it’s also quite cheap. Would recommend to go here when it’s not so many people."
18,2.0,"As we wanted to see the sun going down, we went here around 16.00 (on a work day in autumn), to be surprised by a long queue. This turned out to only be the line for the cable cart; a 45 minute wait to get your tickets and another 45 minute wait to get up to the carts themselfs. The cable cart was only a disappointing 3 minutes, so I recommend walking up to the tower. Going back down with the cable cars additionally was an half hour queue."
19,4.0,The price for cable car is a little bit expensive but you are served with beautiful trees scenery along the way. Plus you don't have to hike. Shuttle from Seoul Station to the cable car station is available.
20,4.0,"This cable car ( actually, it is a big single ropeway car like those in Japan) takes you all the way up to the mountain top of Namsan Park. Seems they only have 2 Ropecars- one going up & other on the way  down). Long wait.Surprisingly as the car ascends, you will notice it is quite high up. The views along the ascend & descend were very nice. Especially with the beautiful sun setting in the horizon.This is the best way up to Namsan Park unless you want to hike up on alternative route. ( not sure if there is)Don't come on weekends or holidays. As it is, the queues today ( weekday) for tickets stretches all the way from ground floor to 3/4floors where the boarding area is. There is also an even longer queue on the Ormi Elevator ( see review of Namsan Park)."
21,4.0,"Cost 8500 won for a return cable car ride.Takes around 2 mins to go to the top.Luckily the sky was cleared today, you can see miles away.The multi colour of the tree leaves in November was so special.Highly recommended if the weather is nice and sunny."
22,5.0,"We queued for about 30 mins and so got up just as the sun was going down. The views of the city from where the cable car drops you are largely obscured by the trees but you could climb the tower to get better ones. However the views on the way up are stunning and at the top are various bars, restaurants and even a games arcade. This felt wonderfully incongruous but we had a lovely time enjoying it. Well worth checking out."
23,5.0,This is a great way to see Seoul from the top. I would suggest taking the cable car up (one-way) and then walking down on the way back. A lot of people were walking up but I personally don't like the steep steps up!Restaurants and shopping at the top if you are into that.
24,3.0,For $8 you can take the convenient cable ride up to Namsan Park  I would recommend going on a sunny day because then you'll get most of the view of the city below and see the lovely mountains surrounding the cable car it's definitely worth a trip get there quickly so you can get a good view in the train.
25,4.0,"To reach N Seoul Tower, the choice is simple - put some leg work up the hill or take the cable car. Most will choose the latter for obvious reasons. The cable car station can be reached by another interesting mode of transport.... a funicular elevator. Go there on a weekday to avoid the crowds and long queue."
26,4.0,"This cable car will take you from Namsan park to the base of the Seoul Tower.  Don't become blasé about how long and hard the walk is if you do not take the cable car.  You must be super fit to attempt the walk.  The cable car is safe and takes about 7 minutes to go up and vice versa.  There is a limit to people getting in so when its full you wait until the next one.  If you do not want to attempt the Seoul Tower then this is a good ride to take as you will get to the bottom of the tower and there is plenty to do there.  Restaurants, ice cream stuff for the adults and kids alike. A great photo taking opportunity from the top of the cable car and along the way."
27,4.0,Quite long Que but the cable car can occupy about 30-40 people at one time and the cable car arrives within 5-10min... so the long Que is quickly shorten
28,5.0,The best time to use the cable car is during the week because the line is very winding and even stretches outside for just the ticket booth. Once you get your ticket you have more winding lines to wait for the cable car. Try to get a spot on the windows of the car for great views.
29,3.0,"Don't take the cable car for the experience, take it as a means of transport to the tower. It was not even a weekend and we had a 40 minute wait and then squashed into the cable car like sardines. Same on the return trip, but you have to queue outside and it is freezing. They split you off into groups of the maximum number of people and then open the door. If you get a chance get to the back of the cable car on the way up and the front on the way down as that is the best view. You will probably have to give the glass a quick clean to get any clear photos. w6000 one way, w8500 rtn."
30,3.0,"We were here on the last day of the year. Be early to avoid long queue, unless you are interested for the evening view of Seoul. Buy a return ticket for more value of your money."
31,4.0,"Our taxi driver dropped us here when we asked about how to get to the Seoul tower and we took the cable car to get to the top. It is a quick ride to where the tower is and it's a good chance to see the city from above. Return ticket will cost slightly less than single ride tickets. (Ok, avoid this place if you are afraid of heights, just saying...)"
32,3.0,"Uncomfortably crammed into each cable car on the way up and the way down. If you're fortunate enough to have your face pressed against the glass, then you can get a decent view of the city. It serves a purpose as an easy way to the N Seoul Tower but I think it was quite pricey for the experience."
33,3.0,"Just 12.000 won for a one way ticket, and this crowded cable car will get you to the bottom of Seoul tower. The views are not that spectacular."
34,3.0,"The car saved us from walking up to the tower, but the ride was not pleasant, with way too many people in the cable car than comfortable. People also push to get their way to the edge of the car for selfies with the window view. It was not a cheap journey either!"
35,4.0,"Of course a bit more expensive way than using stairs, but it gives you an exhilarating thrilling feeling when the cable car goes up from the lower station. We did both ways and they are worth doing. Be aware that evening rides may be crowded and you have to wait a long time before having your turn."
36,5.0,You'll have to take the Namsan Cable Car up to the N Seoul Tower. We decided to go up at night. Wasn't disappointed. The view was amazing.
37,4.0,"There was a long line when we arrived but it moved pretty quickly, you can't possible expect there not to be a wait on a major attraction like this. It was not over priced and the staff were very efficient. The ride up was smooth and fast. We were all very happy."
38,5.0,The cable car ride was a nice view of Seoul.  We went on the weekday morning and didn't have to wait too long to get on a cable car.Glad that we took the car ride up. We still had a nice walk up to get to the Namsan tower platform area.
39,1.0,"Super long queue, (waited for more than an hour) and then a very short ride. Avoid! Best to hike to the top."
40,3.0,"Had read about long queue's on the weekend.  It's true!  After eventually finding the escalator and queing for that, we got to the ticket counter where the sign said 60 minute wait...ended up being just under 2hrs.  Sardine style 3 min ride"
41,5.0,Did a round trip fare on the Cable Car and it's a more relaxing/fun way to ride to the top as opposed to walking or bus. Nice if you've never done it before.
42,4.0,"If you want to see Seoul 360'..You Should goThe Namsan Cable Car is one of the many ways to get up to the Namsan Park. First, you'll have to take a small tram leading to the cable car station and buy your tickets"
43,3.0,A convenient way to get to the N Seoul Tower. You can access to the cable car station via the Namsan Oreumi (sidewalk elevator). Beware that the staff will try to squeeze as many passengers as possible into the car!
44,1.0,"Avoid weekend evening/nights at all costs!We went on a non-holiday weekend Saturday night and it was PACKED! We had to wait 2 hours to get on the cable car but there were no signs outside warning us of the expected wait. It wasn't until we had bought our tickets that we found out it was going to ""up to 2 hours wait""Be careful not to get trapped like we did with non-refundable tickets by following the simple rule of thumb.  If there is a lineup outside the actually building, take a taxi up. Besides, the view isn't amazing from the cable car."
45,3.0,"The nearest Metro station to the cable car is Myeongdong.It's a good 700 meters walk (partially up hill).Upon arrival, you take an inclined elevator to the entrance and from there the fun begin.""Fun"" is a relative thing, that it.While there was no queue while we visited, the ride itself (9 US$ return ticket) was not very eventful nor long.The view is a big meh, and is mostly made up of residential and office buildings.The hill itself is beautiful and looks just great while passing above it.Is it worth the time and effort? Well, the climb is rather steep and is almost impossible while the stairs are slippery, so yes, while not a ""must"", it's an ok experience."
46,1.0,"Waited ages to get on the cable car and they pack you in so tightly, you can't see anything going up unless you're up against a window. Very poorly planned. Only 2 cars going back and forth. Very disappointing especially having experienced other cable car rides in other countries. Would have given it zero stars if I would."
47,3.0,"The wait is too long. Nothing wrong with the ride itself, it was fun, but you have to queue both to get to and from the park. I recommend other forms of transport if you don't like standing in the queue."
48,4.0,"Although you have to wait in line for a couple of hours ( we wanted to take it at night ) it's worth every penny. If you are a Kdrama lover, you will be reviving Boys Over Flower's JanDi and Joon Pyo sleepover in the car. Just breathtaking views."
49,3.0,"If you want to visit the Seoul Tower and must do it in a rush, then take a taxi. But if you have some time and do not mind standing in a potential long queue, then this can be a good choice. The ride cost 8500 won return ticket and takes just a couple of minutes, which is good since it will most likely be very crowded. If you are in good shape and can spare a day or so, try hiking up instead through Namsan park and use the money for lunch or an extra beer."
