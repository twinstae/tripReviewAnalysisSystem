With so many options, how can you know where to go first?I canâ€™t answer that question for you but I do know the one not to go at all would be Lotte Outlets. It is by far the saddest mall experience in Seoul. Good luck to anyone trying to find great value stuff to buy.Lotte Outlets is forgettable. Next. This is the true truth as I say it as it isâ€¦"

At lotte mart we bought a lot of Korean snacks , tea, nuts , price seems cheaper here compare to emart at myeong dong , for example a box of biscuits crown brand at emart Myeongdong was 5000 won and here was 2500 half of the price . They provide free paper boxes ðŸ“¦ with free sticker tape and free ribbons so you could check in at the airport which I did , or you pay 1000 won for the big plastic bag for tourist so you could hand carry fragile items inside the plane ."

Prices vary enormously, but personally I found the average prices of clothing and cosmetics there expensive, and would rather deal with nearby markets and some smaller shops."
