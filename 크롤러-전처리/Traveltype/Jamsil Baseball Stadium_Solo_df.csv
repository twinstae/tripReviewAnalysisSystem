0,5.0,"Great way to spend a Saturday afternoon! Scorching weather, cheap beer and a lively atmosphere! Perfect day out alone, with friends or with the family."
1,5.0,"I visited Jamsil stadium in mid-April for a Wednesday night Doosan Bears game. It was just me for the evening so I picked up a single seat along the first base line in the front row. I found the stadium staff to be pleasant and helpful as they guided me to my seat despite me not really understanding anything on my mobile ticket. The seats were quite spacious when compared to seats at American baseball stadiums. You could actually fit between your seat and the seat next to you. Furthermore, there was a multitude of food options including BBQ and all kinds of chicken and meat. There was also a 7 Eleven where you could purchase convenience store items at reasonable prices. It was quite the experience. Both teams fans were very loud during their at-bats and they sang and cheered the whole time. Very passionate. It was quite different from the American baseball experience. In terms of navigation, subway is the best way to get there. It was easy to find despite there being very few people on the subway wearing Doosan Bears gear who I could follow. Getting home at night wasn't bad either. Overall, the atmosphere is electric. The fans engaged and cheering. The food options are tasty and good value. Seats are comfortable. Highly recommend coming here for a game if you're a fan of baseball. Its a whole new experience in all the right ways."
2,4.0,I can tick this off of my bucket list. Complete and utter insanity... more of a combination of American Idol and the carnival. Very difficult to watch baseball if you are a real fan. The music and dancing girls and singing never stops! A must see if you ever visit Seoul!
3,5.0,I decided to go see the LG Twins vs. Doosan Bears and what a crowd! I happened to be sitting with LG Twins fans and whenever the Twins were up to bat their side of the stadium would break out in song and chants. Then whenever the Bears would go up to bat the other side of the stadium would do the same. What a fun night!
4,5.0,"I went to 2 games.  LG Twins are more popular than Doosan Bears but great atmosphere for both.  The Korean baseball stadiums are designed so the home fans sit in shade, visitors burn in the sun.  So buy your day game tickets for the 1st base side.  For night games consider 3rd base as there are fewer visiting fans.  The cheerleaders for SK Wyverns stuck around after the game and I got photos with both of them!   Also go up to the very top for a good view of the Olympic Stadium."
5,5.0,"Visiting a baseball match in South Korea was absolutely one of the best sport experiences I ever had!It was difficult to get tickets and the lady at my hotel helped me. I got the cheapest ticket, for the outfield. This section is free seating and (as far as I know) was the only european in that section. Did it made me feel uncomfortable? No way! I was really welcomed by everyone and they pulled me into the craziness called Korean Baseball!A great advantage is that you can take your own food and drinks with you. At the subway station and outside you can buy food and drinks. A plastic litre bottle of beer (frozen, so you have cold beer during the whole match) for about $3. Outside there is enough choice of nice food. Inside the stadium you can also get this but is more expensive. Korean Baseball is full of energy. The stadium is stuffed with people and there is a great vibe. Even for people who don't enjoy sport events or understand baseball this is great. The whole show around the baseball is an event itself. At First base there are the cheerleaders and the ""Hype-man"" An over active guy who ""stimulates"" the fans to sing the songs for the players. Every player has it's own song and everyone in the stadium knows them by heart. All the time the fans are singing and cheering. Never a dull moment! As I was alone and the only non-Asian in sight, but it didn't matter. People around me were SO friendly, In Europe and the US we could learn a thing or two how it should be! I was offered drinks, hugged and being involved with the songs. Communication was not easy, I don't speak any Korean and they don't speak any English. They enjoyed me choosing and cheering for their team and I enjoyed there warm welcome. Visiting Baseball gave me an opportunity to mix with locals and enjoy a great sports event.It was a perfect example that sports unite people! Many thanks to my fellow LG Twins fans who took great care of me!"
6,4.0,"This stadium was the main Olympic Stadium, with an indoor gymnasium, swimming pool and many other sports facilities. Many international sporting, cultural events, and concerts held here. There are food vendors and convenient store on site. Subway Line 2, Complex Station, Exit 6 or 7"
7,5.0,Plenty of food choices before the game.  Ability to walk around the whole stadium without being dogged by ushers.  Great atmosphere.  Great time
8,5.0,"I went to see a match between Lotte (Busan) and LG (Seoul), so naturally supported LG. The atmosphere was insanely good for a league match, and the chanting was so much fun, despite the language barrier - each player had their own chants!"
9,5.0,"As an American, I have to say that attending a KBO game has been a highlight in my life as a baseball fan. The fans are amazingly awesome and the only thing I can think to describe it is that it's like a major league soccer (futbal) match. It's non stop cheering which creates a super fun atmosphere. It is highly entertaining; not only the fans (who are awesome!!) but also the level of baseball. I'll just say that the crowd goes nuts for a base hit, as well making as basic, ""routine"" outs. I love it and would highly recommend this experience to anyone - especially those with a MLB background. Trust me, you'll appreciate it."
10,5.0,"For those of you that love baseball in the US, I recommend seeing a game in Korea. I had the front desk at my hostel book the ticket online for me and I just went to the box office to pick up the ticket. I sat right behind the Doosan Bears dug out. The seat was in the first row and had a table in front and that was shared with two more seats next to me. It was money well spent. (40,000 KWN). Outside the stadium are food vendors that sell traditional Korean food (dried squid, chicken, octopus, etc) along with beer.  I was so stunned when I was told we can take beer inside. If you buy a can, upon entrance there are clear cups you are to use to pour the beer into and throw away the can. The cans aren't allowed inside for some reason (I learned the hard way). Only bottles with twist on caps are permitted. There are also workers that walk up and down the stairs selling beer from a keg strapped to their backs. (If you don't want to leave your seat, this is another option). The game is family friendly and it's an experience to see how united the fans are to cheer on their own teams. I've been to a Japanese baseball game, and the Korean fans put them to shame.  Go Doosan Bears!!!!!"
11,5.0,"Easily the best baseball experience I've had. Each player has their own song and chants and each side takes turns when their team are up to bat. Most of the excitement are in the stands. $10USD for great seats $3USD for beer you can get street food as you're walking in, easily accessible by the metro."
12,5.0,This was my first baseball game ever.  Great day out.  Koreans love their baseball. I had never experienced baseball but I had heard that it was a good day out.  It was.  I brought my ticket at the stadium on the day.  The line was long but after asking some non Koreans where to go I found the ticket booth ok and the lady selling tickets spoke English.  Worth it.
13,4.0,"I like well-grown green grass on ground and facilities such as CVS etc. But, it is difficult to find a appropriate entrance written on ticket."
14,5.0,"Easy to get tickets for the baseball pre -game , amazing atmosphere and sights.Well worth an evening."
15,5.0,"One of the best experiences in Korea (for an American) was a Korean baseball game. Didn't matter who won, it was a good time. This is for sports enthusiasts in the summer or people staying longer than 4 days. Culturally, its not a must see- but a lot of fun if you have time to go and time to explore. :)"
16,4.0,"Professional baseball game in Korea is something different from that of America, and for that reason alone it is worth a visit if you're in town during the season. There are 10 professional teams in Korea, and oddly enough, Jamsil Baseball Stadium is the home to two Seoul-based teams- LG Twins and Doosan Bears. Unlike American ballparks where most spectators are home fans, Korean ballparks are divided into both home and visiting team's fans, as Korea is fairly small country. 1st base side is where home fans sit, and 3rd base side is where visiting team's fans sit, and you will notice this as each side has their own cheerleading team, complete with female cheerleaders and a male head cheerleader who leads fans to sing along to each players' anthem and help out with dance routines. It is pretty noisy and they keep doing it even when pitcher's pitching, so it could get annoying, but it is a part of Korean baseball culture. Try to get into its groove and sing and dance along with fans, that's half the fun in itself. Jamsil is the biggest ballpark in Korea and while it's little bit old and rusted, a great place to soak up korean brand of baseball. Have fun!"
17,5.0,Baseball in Korea is not to be missed. The show in the stands is almost as fun as the game! Tickets are cheap! So is food and beer!
18,5.0,"They got Power Ranger Cheerleaders! OH MY GOSH! IT WAS CRAZY! I've never had soooo much fun at a baseball game, and I liked staring at the drunk foreigners. Most cheap and entertaining game I've ever seen even though I don't like Baseball! hahahahaha."
19,4.0,Parking like most stadiums isn't easy and there is lots of traffic on the way out like all stadiums so public transportation/subways is always a plus.  Lots of fast food and other restaurants.  Most seats are great and games are always fun no matter what team you are rooting for.
20,5.0,"Korean baseball is more like a European football match or NHL hockey game in fan cheering and participation.  You can bring your own food and beer inside, which is a great thing, and keeps the costs way down compared to overpriced USA concessions.  You can even leave mid game and get more beer and snacks from various vendors and carts outside and come back in with your ticket stub, so no need to carry in a twelve pack and three pizzas all at once.  The fan interest is fun to see, flags waving and stadium wide chants and camaraderie.  Having many teams play in the same city creates a lot of rivalries within family and friends.  The game itself is a little less refined than an MLB game.  Think wild pitches and fielding errors rather than a perfectly pitched game, but that makes if fun to watch."
21,3.0,"Interesting to see baseball from another culture. The fans are as rapid as Japanese fans with the similar routing rituals. The tickets are cheap, you can bring in your own food and beer and the baseball is good (but the games are very long). Surprisingly, the field itself is poor and the facility isn't all that well maintained. I enjoyed it but was surprised at the quality of the stadium."
22,5.0,The stadium built for 1988 Seoul Olympics is in excellent shape and well maintained. The star gallery brings nostalgia of earlier Games. The track which saw a couple of World and Olympic records is hot and live. Must see for sports lovers.
23,5.0,If you visit Korea you must see a Korean baseball game.  The experience is entirely different from an american baseball game.
24,5.0,Baseball is alive and well in Korea! Seats and food are cheap by American standards. Lots of positive energy and HOT CHEERLEADERS!!! Highly recommended!
