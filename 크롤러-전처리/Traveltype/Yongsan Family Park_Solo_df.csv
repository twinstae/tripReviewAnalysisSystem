1,3.0,Visited on a weekday and it was pretty quiet with small groups of people and children playing or strolling around the park. Worth to visit for 2 hours or so to enjoy nature.

A great way to spend an hour each day either with lots of walking around amidst fresh air or keep trim with exercisers. There's a nice playground for children too or lots of quiet space for those wanting to read a book, write or just enjoy quiet time.  Would be perfect if there is a refreshment area for cold drinks and food to satiate thirst after long walks. :)"
