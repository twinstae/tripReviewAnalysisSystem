0,5.0,"I loved this area! Went on a Friday night, watched the show which was very relaxing! Then walked over through all the other buildings, and a night market with food trucks! I think its worth seeing, and ita free!"
1,3.0,The light show was quite average and certainly not worth the 30 minute bus journey we took to get there. It was not really a ‘show’ but just coloured lights on the side of the bridge.Definitely worth going to if you’re in walking distance but not worth going to if you have a longer journey.
2,3.0,. . . is how one tour guide accurately describes this attraction. We walked from the JW Marriott Seoul and were less than impressed -- but the Banpo Hangang Park is lovely for sitting out on a cool Seoul evening.
3,3.0,"Went there as it supposed to be a rainbow fountain festival only to find out that it only happens on Friday and Saturday nights when we reached the place.Without this feature, the visit was only so so and probably not worth the hassle going there.  There were some nice lighting (but not a big area) to take some pictures."
4,3.0,We went with high expectations which was probably not the best idea. A light show is probably not the best description of this event. However it was a bucket list thing almost considering the guiness book and world's longest fountain fact so in that regard we were happy.If you're coming from the main city area or anywhere that is not close to the bridge we recommend that you spend the evening there. It's a great atmosphere by the park area with heaps of food options and little craft vendors and music. It's a great way to relax eat some street food and watch the fountain. If you're coming by bus then be warned as it took us 40 mins for an 8minute journey so plan ahead and make sure you leave some back up time if you're unable to make the show at your preferred time.Either way it was nice for us to see something that's made it's in records.
5,4.0,"We walked across this bridge at sunset and were the only two pedestrians there. It was nice having the bridge to ourselves and the view from there was really pretty. We really enjoyed the walk. Next to Banpo Bridge there were floating islands which were used in the filming of The Avengers: Age of Ultron. We admired the islands from a distance but didn't go in for a closer look. Apparently the park near the floating islands is a good time to watch the rainbow bridge light up at night, but now was not the time of year when the light show is on unfortunately."
6,1.0,"Lots of people sitting and waiting in the warm evening for... absolutely nothing. A muffled tannoy announcement that was too quiet for anyone to hear must have been saying that it had been cancelled (for seemingly no reason) but as no one could hear it everyone just sat and waited. Eventually, after over an hour, we gave up. Looks like a pipe with holes in it stuck on the side of a concrete bridge... give it a miss."
7,4.0,"We walked over at night from Garosu-gil, and arrived after the light/fountain show (8pm) but in time to hang out near the bridge where there are at least thirty food trucks and vendors selling knick-knacks on the east side of the bridge until about midnight. The west side of the bridge features a few buildings built out into the water with restaurants as well as an electric-powered boat attraction that we did (not listed separately on tripadvisor) that was an enjoyable 30 minutes. Nice ambience, good place to picnic and to see locals hanging out."
8,2.0,"Came to see the water show especially for our last night in seoul. From the pics it looked really special and colorful, but its not like that in person, youll just see water with a little bit of light and music on the background. Nothing special."
9,3.0,"The fountain and light show was a bit of a disappointment. There is far too much ambient white lights from the bridge that the coloured lights on the water hardly show up. To get any sort of a half good photo you need a tripod and long duration photo. Luckily there was a night market on so lots of stalls and places to eat and even some singers. Would have been a bit of a wasted journey had it not been for that. How to get there. Train to ""Express Bus Terminal Station"" then leave on exit 8. Follow the road to the junction with the overhead road and turn right. As you reach the pedestrian lights, cross the road and follow the path down to the water. About 15 mins walk but no stairs once you leave the station."
10,2.0,"Was hoping the colours would be more spectacular but was disappointed. If you want a picnic on the river bank, come and enjoy, otherwise go shopping in the underground shopping area nearby instead."
11,4.0,Banpo bridge or rainbow bridge illuminates the night and it is something unique for a water feature. It is nicer seeing from afar. A great park for cycling and picnic.
12,5.0,Beautiful view any time of day but especially at night. Is very close to the Express Bus Terminal. Worth a visit.
13,3.0,Just come in the right time and u will look the bridge show. Its so windy and little bit cold bring ur couple here
14,3.0,"I went with a high hope of watching the show of the bridge without knowing it only operates from April to October every year. I went in at the end of November, so I didn't manage to see the show. Furthermore, it is not very accessible and far from the nearest subway station. You need to walk quite a long distance before you can reach the destination. Might consider to come back again and watch the show in other seasons (except winter)."
15,4.0,"There's three ways to see this bridge with its fountains and colours: from the water, from the land and from the bridge itself. We took a boat cruise one night and were pleased to see the whole thing from a boat. So the other ways are unfamiliar for me, but as far as we could see there were people also on the bridge with cameras.Don't forget to bring your warm clothes specially during autumn time."
16,3.0,"If I have to choose between the Rainbow Bridge in Seoul and the one in Tokyo, my vote goes to the Rainbow Bridge in Tokyo;. The one in Tokyo is a suspension bridge crossing northern Tokyo Bay between Shibaura Pier and the Odaiba waterfront development in Minato, Tokyo. View from Seen from Odaiba - lamps placed on the wires supporting the bridge, which are illuminated into three different colors, red, white and green every night using solar energy obtained during the day. The bridge in Tokyo is easily accessible while the one in Seoul is quite difficult to access, with its convoluted instructions. We went in circles looking for the bridge in Seoul for more than half an hour. I was disappointed."
17,3.0,"I went to the bridge with high expectation having seen water fountain displays is Vegas, KL and Macau. However this water fountain display is a bit of a let down. The music blasts from speakers that seem overloaded and the sound is lousy, and the colorful fountain is kind of average.if you are in the park, which itself is an amazing green oasis in the hustle and bustle of Seoul, it makes sense to go there on the way to the floating island. But otherwise it is not a major attraction in itself."
18,3.0,"The fountain ""show"" itself didn't look as good as in the photos. I think it looks better from far.If you have spare time and want to have a look then you could get there using the route we took, which is different to the ones mentioned elsewhere and easy to follow. Also good for tired weary legs as it doesn't require much walking.Take subway line 6 to Noksapyeong (one station from Itaewon). Take exit 4 and walk about 50 metres to the bus stop. Take bus number 740, which should turn right immediately at the junction of the subway you came from. The bus route includes a ride on the Banpo Bridge. Press the button when bus is at the bridge so that the driver will stop for you to get down. Bus stop is just a very short walk to the pavilion where people can sit and watch the fountain show."
19,2.0,"I had read many reviews about this bridge I have seen pictures about and my expectations were high after all. Unfortunately, once arrived near the bridge I saw absolutely nothing of what I was waiting for. No lights, no spectacle with splashes of water in short has been a disappointment. The bridge is normal and if it were not for the show I expected it is nothing spectacular."
20,4.0,"One word to describe the fountain show – spectacular! Watch it at night.To reach Banpo Bridge via the Seoul Subway – get off at Dongjak Station (Exit 1 or 2). Go down the staircase and head to the river. Then, turn right and continue walking along the river bank. You will pass Dongjak Bridge before reaching Banpo Bridge. The distance is about 1.5km away and a slow walk should take about 30 minutes.More on my blog:http://www.kenwooi.com/2014/06/banpo-bridge-rainbow-fountain.html"
21,3.0,We visited the bridge during daylight and whilst I'm sure that it's impressive at night I'm afraid during the day it's probably not worth hanging around for.
22,4.0,This is a really fun attraction and I haven't seen anything like it before! You can see the water and light show from either end as well as walking under the bridge. We lived in the area so it was easy for us to find but I can imagine it wouldn't be very easy for a tourist as there wouldn't be a lot of signs on how to get there.
23,4.0,I went to see this place in 2013the place is not easy to find. there is no direction sign from nearest stationbut we managed to get here and it was good
24,2.0,"We went in mid May 2013. We understand that the fountain should starts at 8pm, 8.30pm and 9pm but it didn't. Disappointed and not sure why the show didn't happen. If there is some way to check out if the show is on, suggest you do so. It is quite a walking distance from Subway and with the rain and cold wind blowing, you surely dont wanna be as disappointed as I am."
