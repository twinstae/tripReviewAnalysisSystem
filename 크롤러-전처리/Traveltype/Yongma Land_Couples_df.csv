0,5.0,"Finally amusement park without lines and sugar rushed kids who yell and run around - we totally enjoyed the place and had way more fun than we would have in normal amusement park! We were only visitors there at the time. Easily you can spend hours there so book some time. There's also little ""cafeteria"" where you can buy drinks and popsicles."

Finding your way can be tricky as the park rests on a hilly portion and is covered by a residential neighborhood. Google map helps. We boarded the bus to Yongma Park entrance and then took the rest of the way by foot. Our park visit was in the morning and when we got there, there were only two other people inside. Come prepared. Bring your powerbank (to charge your devices.) Wear comfortable shoes. And if you must be extra - bring outfit changes! The park has a well-maintained toilet to accommodate your wardrobe changes. The crowd picks up in the afternoon, and I suppose because the park provides a good vantage point for the sunset.The entrance fee is negligible. But it is good to pack snacks with you as there are no vending machines inside."
