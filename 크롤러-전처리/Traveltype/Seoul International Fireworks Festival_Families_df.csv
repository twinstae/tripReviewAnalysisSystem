Canada's show was just OK (sorry Canada!), but Spain's was great and Korea's-- I didn't know where to look, there was so much going on at once!!Great food and tons of cheap ballooons/glowsticks and junk your kids will beg you for. Super crowded, so if you want a riverfront seat get in early. It's worth it!"
