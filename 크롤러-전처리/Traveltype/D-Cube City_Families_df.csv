2,3.0,Initially we came here to bring our 4years boy to visit pororo park. But its close now!!!There's a hype little shopping mal named hyundai shopping mall within d'cube city. Its a small but stylish shopping mal. Theres food court on the lower floor. But the price is slightly expensiveIf you leave the area its worth to visit the shopping mal. If you leave far its not worthed to make a trip here!
