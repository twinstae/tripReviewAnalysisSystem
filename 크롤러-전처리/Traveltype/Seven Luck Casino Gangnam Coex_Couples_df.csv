0,2.0,We didn't plan on going here but we're walking around downtown and came across it so we tried it out. The gaming floor is not very large. There is one section of table games and a small section of slot machines. I didn't go near the tables so I can't really rate them but I played a couple of slots without much action. I'd estimate there were about 50 machines. Anything under 1000 krw won't pay out at the machines so you can save slips and take them to the cage.There is a self service soft drink dispenser with the usual choices of sodas.

We had such a bad experience, we cancelled our memberships so we wouldn't receive offers or deals that would tempt us to return.  There is no going back after the awful time we had.  The overall atmosphere was that of desperate people and addicts, with a staff that was clearly just done and fed-up, didn't care at all about your needs or wants, and we NEVER got our drink orders in the 3 hours or so we were there, even though we asked multiple times.  I had more money to spend, but it just wasn't worth it!  This place is horrible.  You should go to Walkerhill Paradise Casino if you want good casino fun.  That place treats you like a VIP no matter who you are, and are always on top of their game.  Seven Luck was the worst casino and tourist experience I've ever had!  Stay away!"
2,1.0,"People go to casinos to have fun and to spend a few hours of time. This place is really small and you will not feel welcome. Only a couple of tables were open. The tables with low minimum bets (less than 50000 won) were full. Over half of the tables were Baccarat tables. There were only a couple of slot machines that are somewhat understandable from a Western perspective. There is no bar and the dining area (4-5 tables) doesn't offer any drinks: you have to sit at the game table to order them! It was also VERY hot already before lunch time. Only positive side of this place is that there is no entrance fee, so you can leave soon without feeling too bad."
3,3.0,This was an average casino. We only came across it because we were walking from COEX mall to the intercontinental COEX. Worth going in to look around.
4,3.0,"The casino is not so big. Mostly are table/card games. The slot games were boring as they were old games. No new machine. Luckily, I won approx. US$600 at the Hot shot slot machine after playing for less than 15mins. The games were paid in KRW. The other gamblers looked at me with angry eyes because I heard they complained to their friends that they lost their money on the same machine after sitting there for hours."
