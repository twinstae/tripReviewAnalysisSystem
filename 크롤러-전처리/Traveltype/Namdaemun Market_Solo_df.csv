0,3.0,"Mostly shops and a lot are the same. Lots of clothes, socks, bags, etc. Some streetfood. Try the dumplings!"
1,4.0,"The place was packed with stalls selling clothes, food, souvenirs. They are lot cheaper than at Myeongdong. The food is much on the street food options. Try the egg bread, or the hotteok."
2,4.0,Interesting attraction with a great food alley. Hidden gem in the heart of Seoul. I recommend a hearty bowl of Kalguksu and a nice stroll around the market.
3,4.0,"It is at Hoehyeon Station and not far from Myeongdong. Rows and rows of alleys between shops where traders peddle all kinds of goods. If you are on a budget and  ran out of ideas what to buy to bring home, a visit to this place will soon get you planning what you shall buy for whom.Do go in the morning as traders have this belief that securing the first sale early bringeth luck for the rest of the day (urban legend?) but have the fun of bargaining for your loot. All for a steal. And since you are already there do visit the underground mall as well."
4,5.0,"This is my fourth year’s pilgrimage to Namdaemun market’s multitude of food alleys: before starting my ritual of bargain hunting, I made sure to follow the aroma of grilled fish. And oh, what a marvel that was! The egg soufflé was amazingly light, and on any given day, there must be 4 different fish on offer. No menu, no fuss, just find an empty stool and enjoy your lunch, for less than 10$! Heaven on earth!"
5,4.0,This market was recommended by my hotel staff after I complained about the somehow expensive prices at the malls and it didn’t disappoint. Not only is it a good shopping experience but it is a good place to interact with the locals and offers a wide range of street food. I
6,4.0,"Night market style arrangement but open day and night. Can find anything is this market, but u need to bargain. "
7,5.0,"Went for a stroll trough seoul and I've stumbled on namdaemun market.  It has great variety of food, clothing and other appearal.  It's also. Cheaprr too! A plus thing is that they don't keep yelling at people(props)."
8,4.0,I was referred to Food Alley(a small narrow lane opposite to Bldg C) by a Korean tourist representative and happened a lady who speaks well English mentioned they have English menu. Why not? I gave it a try and chose Bibimbap and turned out to be so far the best I had ever
9,5.0,This area is well known and a must see. Especially if you like a bargain or street food. There are several adjoining streets and an interesting place to go at night. It's also not too far to walk for Myoungdong night market. 
10,5.0,"If you are looking for tourist gifts then I would definitely start here before venturing out to the more popular street markets as I found some great bargains here!Of course they do sell similar items but it's also a place where the locals mingle with all the tourist so it's a great place to people watch, definitely worth trying out some of the food stores too, I got some fried doughnuts and they were yummy!"
11,5.0,"There is much to see here. At first I was not interested as I had been to another market and I didn't really know why I would want to explore more stalls and why I would need numerous,  inexpensive trinkets. Still, I kept walking and the next thing you know I was very interested in the market. It's interesting to see coffee shops, run by a single person, tucked between perhaps a little jewelry stand and a store selling hats. You will see all types of products, from leather jackets to $3 earrings. You will find all types of fried foods, being prepared right before your eyes. We'll find a complete alleyway of nothing but restaurants. Other food kiosks are scattered about. On one side of the market is fronted by quite a few camera shops and I even bought a lens. Well, I guess that says I was having a pretty good time."
12,5.0,"Love taking souvenirs home and sharing it with family and friends but on a tight budget? Namdaemun Market got your back! They have tons of different souvenirs to choose from such as kitchenwares, clothings for adults and kids, stationeries, accessories, to beauty products, and more. They also have food alleys that's definitely budget-friendly.Another thing that I love here is that the tourist information people are everywhere! They have english-speaking personnel and other language experts that you can talk to and ask about directions and all. They're easy to find since they're wearing red uniforms and hold placards.VERY TOURIST-FRIENDLY!"
13,5.0,"In contrast to many other places in the world, Seoul is not super touristy and Namdaemun even less so. There's mainly Korean locals who shop and dine in the area so you won't really be got with tourist traps or tourist prices. Be careful eating at the street stalls though, you don't know if they're sanitising that stuff properly.  Lots of good souvenir shops too."
14,5.0,Enjoyed so much more than Insadong market because it was more authentic and less typical retail. Many products were the same. Allow at least 2 hours. Enjoy!
15,5.0,"I love this Energetic Market so much.There is lot of popular street food shop in local.Mandu , Kal-guksu, Hotteok...Fresh fruit Juice."
16,3.0,"Huge market south of Sungnyemum Gate.  Visited on Sunday afternoon.  Appeared less vibrant than Myeongdong (I had visited Saturday afternoon), and didn't have the food stalls.  But prices were cheaper (unless I didn't bargain hard enough at Myeongdong). Worth an hour (or two if you are wanting to shop), good for souvenirs."
17,4.0,This open-air market is the perfect place to go and try a large variety of Korean food. Very cheap and good. Definitely suggested.
18,4.0,"Quaint it ain't. Namdaemun Market is huge. Not just a rabbit warren of streets selling everything you can imagine: from kitchenware to clothing, from bags to braised pig knuckles, there are numerous warehouse-sized buildings to explore. To get a good deal, you need to bargain."
19,5.0,The area is buzzing with vendors and above and underground shops to sell you almost everything under the sun. You can walk and pick your spots totry a taste of Seoul or you can walk through the alley corridors to slide into ine of the many restaurants to eat like a local. It's  the Korean version of the early days of Canal street in NYC.
20,3.0,"This is the oldest and largest traditional market in Korea. It is spread out over many blocks with about 10,000 vendors. Nowhere else in Korea can you find such an array of items. It was an interesting place to wander through even without buying anything. And it's named for the Namdaemun South Gate nearby which I visited also while in this area."
21,1.0,"Majority of the clothings sold are very dated. Good for shopping of children clothings but not adult. Some vendors there are pretty unfriendly too. Pricing of souveniers are either the same or higher than what you can find at express bus terminal shopping area. I would suggest not to waste your time to make a trip here. Yes there are many stalls there but if you are looking to buy clothings, 95% of the shops are selling extremely dated clothings, after taking out food & beverage stalls, only 2% are worth a look, but pricing is higher than what you can get elsewhere. Truely a total waste of time."
22,1.0,"Maybe it was because I visited Nandaemun on a weekday evening, maybe it’s because I’d just come from Taiwan where the night markets are world-renowned, but this is a very unremarkable market selling a limited selection of food. Besides fixed shops offering baked goods and pigs’ feet, there are stalls selling skewers which average about 3,000-5,000 won. Each stall sells almost exactly the same selection at almost the same price. There are alleyways off the main streets in which you can find sit-down restaurants selling the usual Korean fare - bulgogi, noodles, cuttlefish etc. I went into one of these and had spiced cold noodles with boiled egg.  From the stalls I had rather some chewy octopus skewers and average chicken skewers, some bland fried shrimp and a nondescript sugared dumpling. I wouldn’t repeat the experience. Overall I was really disappointed. Having lived in China I came expecting a high standard of street food but this was nothing to write home about. I have seen much better markets in very rural areas of other parts of Asia, so I was surprised at just how uninspiring this one was given that Seoul is such a large and international city.  In fact I would venture to say it’s the worst market I’ve ever been to. As for the products for sale, they are primarily Supreme imitation hoodies and other paraphernalia, and trinket shops. I can’t say I find that kind of thing interesting but if you do you might enjoy that side of the market."
23,4.0,"Namdaemun Market is quite a large place, selling a variety of products - clothing, bags, food, etc. If you want something cheap, best come here instead of going to the department stores. Also lots of places to sit down and have a coffee or snack."
24,4.0,Plenty of shops selling so much stuff- even if you don't wish to buy this is an interesting market to visit. Lots of areas to get lost in. Lots of atmosphere.
25,4.0,This busy market is a great place to get souvenirs and really anything you could possibly need. Grad something on a stick to eat and wander round.
26,3.0,OK Market full of tat. If you like fake supreme stuff you will be in heaven. Some OK street food but otherwise I'd skip this bit of town!
27,3.0,"If you are in Seoul, you definitely need to check out their markets. It is organized chaos and something to behold. All manner of food stuffs (although seaweed seems to predominate) and ready to eat street food vendors. One of my guides indicated there were some 27,000 retailers here. All small shops. The quality seemed good for the most part. It was fun to get a little container of fried crabs and just walk around munching and seeing the various wares. Beware though, there are very few garbage cans so be prepared to carry your empty containers for a while. All the items are quite cheap. The crabs were 5000 won (about $5 USD) for a big tub. It is just a short walk from the main Seoul Railway station along the elevated walkway, the 7107. There are other shops selling clothes, tools, and souvenirs as well."
28,5.0,This is a great market to visit although very very busy! It was very interesting walking around looking at all the stuff people sell!
29,4.0,"It’s a great market, just be prepared to do a little digging. Found good deals on shirts, scarves, every day use kinds of items."
30,5.0,..its a good place to buy some item for gift..its cheap and all items is there..you just need to keep looking for it..
31,5.0,This Market was very close to my hotel so I went down several times in the evening Lots of street food on offer it is very vibrant with lots of different people sending different types of things from pot scrubbers to jeans  to three piece suites and more. Very interesting experience well worth a look
32,5.0,This is one of the largest traditional outdoor market in the middle of Seoul.     Varieties of foods and goods are endless here.      Love tasting some quick snacks from street vendors location in central part of the market alley.      It still retains its charms from bygone era of shopping from old time.
33,3.0,"I visited this place to find a special vintage camera, there're lots of stores for that purpose near the Sungnyemun Gate. The market itself is rather messy, lots of chinese products of all kind. No good souvenirs or fashion clothes. There's a tourist info desk ot far from subway gate 5."
34,5.0,Visited Namdaemum for the first time. Love the varieties of merchandise here. The market is open early in the morning. Do go early before the big crowds descend. Try out your bargaining skills. :)You can get pretty good stuff ranging from scarves to Korean traditional tableware. I came back here couple more times. Don't forget to check out the little eateries in the small alleys for the authentic local cuisine.
35,5.0,"There are a lot of bargain souvenirs, street foods, pricey and cheap goods. 1 station from myeongdong station.many choices on  different items"
36,5.0,"not a bad market to visit, basically sell lots of clothing and the street food here are cheap.  clothes are quite cheap too."
37,5.0,"I love this market, lots of good food. Things to buy for soveniers and nicely located near the metro Hyeon, exit 4 and 5. You won't go wrong in coming here. There are guides to help you around if you are lost. Love it so much that I even came for a last walk on my day of flying off before I checked out from my guesthouse. Wonderful place"
38,5.0,"Great place if you are a foodie and love to explore local food at its simplest. Plenty of choices to eat tasty and inexpensive specialties for which the best recommendation is the fact that locals really do eat here. And once you filled up your belly, you can dive into shopping of food and other goods souvenirs, as Namdeaemun is not only a food place."
39,5.0,"If you enjoy a bazaar atmosphere, this is for you. Indoors and passageways full of  men, women and children wear, custom jewelery, items for the house, you name it, is here.  Even several Christmas shops. There are wholesale only shops among the offerings but they will tell you if you happen to walk in one. Plenty of food stalls to maintain the energy."
40,5.0,"I stayed near this traditional market during a recent visit to Seoul and visited three times. Huge, the place has eight numbered gates; more than 10,000 stores in buildings and stalls; merchandise ranging from flowers to military equipment; and food carts. It seems to be the liveliest in the morning, when I encountered thick crowds,  and rather quiet in the late afternoon. The market obviously attracts shoppers, based on the transactions I saw taking place, but also visitors with cameras, soaking up the atmosphere and enjoying photo ops.I went for the atmosphere but ended up returning to seek out inexpensive souvenirs, such as bookmarks and fans. Though I looked at other items, including clothing and accessories, nothing appealed. Much better quality can be found in nearby department stores but with higher prices.My favorite part of the market proved to be the ubiquitous food carts, where vendors prepare all kinds of yummy-looking fare. I finally got in a long line waiting for a hotteok (deep-fried veggie pancake) by Gate 2. It took about 20 minutes before I could put my order in and I received the hotteok almost immediately. The cost was 1,000 KRW, about $1 U.S.  I stood on the street, eating this tasty delight and savoring every bite.It is easy to get lost in this complex of pedestrian streets and buildings, so I suggest getting a map from the market's information kiosk before starting to explore. Enter from Gate 2 at Namdaemun-ro or Gate 5 at Toegye-ro. The kiosk stands on the street that connects the two gates, near the souvenir shops.Namdaemun Market is easily accessed by subway (lines 1, 2, 4) and many bus lines. It takes about 15 minutes to walk there from Seoul Station."
41,5.0,"Whatever, wherever, whichever people says about buying souvenir from Korea, for me, this is THE PLACE. Without a single iota of doubt, this is the place to be to look for Korean souvenirs ranging from fridge magnets, unique Korean Cutleries, and so on. But the best time to visit is after lunch time since lots of shops will be fully operational by then. So prepare the money and shops (souvenirs)."
42,5.0,"This review will focus on Kalguksu Alley or “noodle alley” that is inside the Namdaemun Market.  It is difficult to find.  I had a local Korean friend with me and we had to ask about 4 people.  It was kind of fun to find because it is literally hidden.  I would recommend using a maps app and not giving up.  Once you do find it take a seat at any of the many soup stalls.  You’ll be knocking elbows with fellow eaters.  There’s no way around this due to the very small space and high demand of the food served. The alley is only about 20 yards long.  Most stalls serve soup noodles and bibimbap.  When you’re finished, pay and leave.  There will probably be people literally standing behind you waiting their turn.  This is an “only in Seoul” type of experience.  Please try it."
43,4.0,"The entire market is enormous, especially if you enter the many malls within the area itself. I entered two of such malls and wanted to purchase some jewelry but was told that it’s not for sale to individuals, only business(wholesale). This was a little disappointing. However, the street food is delicious, the hotteok in particular is a must try! It’s not necessary to walk the whole market as majority of the stuff on sale is repeated throughout, and may be a little too old-fashioned for some tourist."
44,4.0,"I almost got lost in this market 😊. It is a must. Please note that if you are lost or looking for specific information on the area, touristic officers are located almost at every 2 streets or in the most populous area of the market."
45,5.0,Small alley down from gate 5 on left side as not easy to find famous spicy fish stew plenty of places to choose from all doing the stew fantastic food
46,3.0,"The market is massive and stretches on.  There are specific markets within the market for shoes or underwear etc.  I was looking for some shoes but almost all were low quality synthetics.  I did find one that had good quality leather shoes but he does have anything above US size 9.Found most of the items were low quality and probably from China, although they insist that it is made in Korea.It’s fun to walk around and maybe yo might find something you like.  There is also a market for vintage clothing and flea market.It will take a day to explore all.  There are neighbourhoods you can also wonder off near the market where you can have a meal or see some of the older houses."
47,5.0,Found there is a lot to see and there is a nice selection of things a person can purchase. The street food was amazing!!! Glad I had the chance to visit!
48,3.0,I love only the street food here but I think that's enough for me. The tastes are okay. I dont buy anything there.
49,5.0,"Not much English is spoken here but you can easily point and they'll understand what you want. There are so many different stores, such as fresh food, dumplings (these are a must!), trinkets and there's this one little cart at one of the entrances where there is usually a massive line for either a sweet or savoury bun. I waited in line, and the vegetable noodle bun I bought was delicious on my empty stomach. You can really spend hours here and I'd highly recommend visiting."
50,5.0,Crazy market — a must see when in Seoul - most impressive are are the food stalls - prices are OK not so cheap though- it requires energy to stay there for some time :)
51,4.0,"Huge numbers of shops, selling everything from t-shirts, souvenirs, kitchen tools etc. Nice place to stroll around for 1-2 hours. Price is reasonable."
52,5.0,"You can find anything from fresh flowers, homeware, clothes and even toilet curtains! Bought 10 pairs of socks for $7.00 here. Very cheap and handy."
53,5.0,actually so many kinds have korean traditional things  and also really cool item very get to easy when you coming korea please try there
54,4.0,You can easy get lost in the streets of this market. Right next to Myeong-dong.  Another place you can shop for a vast myriad of goods!
55,4.0,"I stayed literally across the road from this market for 3 months when i was in Seoul which was great in terms of cheap shopping and grocery's and after a few weeks the ajuma's and ahjussi's were very nice always saying hello to me and giving me free food and snicks which was lovely, around 2/3pm the street food carts set up and it is sooooooo good and quite a lot cheaper than myeongdong!there is also a tourist centre just off the main strip of the market where i was able to get a new sim card after my other one ran out and for a discount, the agassi's were very helpful and set up the new sim card for me as well as getting me a cup of tea while i waited"
56,5.0,Quite big and busy. A lot of interesting souvenir items to buy. But you can easily lost your way. Make sure you use Kakao Map for navigation.
57,4.0,This is the first place i visited during my recent visit to South Korea. The place was at walking distance from city hall where i was staying. The markets here closes early but good for buying Korean stuff and gifts.
58,5.0,As the Korean say “from needle to a cow” that all what you may find t the Namdaemun marketIt’s an old traditional market by Seoul old gate Like flee market you get different things ManalOman
59,4.0,"Got there at 7:30 A.M. on a Saturday.  Market not busy yet, which was GREAT.  Lot's of fun looking around and asking and checking.  Some of the markets are indoors so there was air-conditioning.  I didn't buy much because the prices were generally not good deals like I've seen in China and Malaysia, but it was fun looking."
60,4.0,I went on a food tour of Namdaemun Market and sampled several types of food and drinks at the various food stalls and restaurants.  There were quite a number of food outlets in the market.  There were stalls selling all sorts of items in the market.  There were also shopping centres with multiple floors.  There were lanes with stalls selling only specific items such as military clothing and stationery.A free map of Namdaemun Market is available at the Tourist Information Center in the Market.
61,4.0,"At the beginning you assume this is just a large street market. Then you go into the buildings where there are three or four floors of market stalls and realise it is enormous.  I found it a fascinating place to visit but there was nothing I wanted to buy. There are a lot of jewellery stalls inside the buildings, and quite a lot making jewellery as well as selling it."
62,1.0,"I read in many places about this ""icon"" and Seoul's must visit market but after visiting it I would warmly advice anyone to do yourself a favor and don't go there unless you got a spare half day with nothing else to do.Almost ALL stuff there is very very poor manufactured trash that looks coming from a third world country.It is a kind of stuff you can buy in any city in the world such as mainly women's garments but I must stress it's all garbage quality while prices are like buying from a regular shop.There is some Korean look stuff like hats and fans and again only for women, but does it make sense going to Namdaemun Market?ALL stuff is without prices so you must be able to speak Korean and willing to bargain just to buy trash!There are also some shops which sell international alcohol but again there are no prices so in these cases I don't even bother asking the price but walk away.It was a very disappointing experience and frankly speaking I don't get why people on forums talk so much about this ""iconic"" trash & trash place!Do yourself a favor and avoid this place!"
63,4.0,Lots of items. I found some really low priced souvenirs but you have to ask as they are on the second floor and inside
64,5.0,"Be sure not to reach too early as the shops are mostly open only after 9:30am. So, have a good breakfast before you head down. Do take note that this market isn’t open on Sunday. Right across The Courtyard at Marriot, Namdaemun Market is made up of street stalls, shops lining the streets on ground level of old buildings and old shopping malls (selling wholesale clothes, jewelry etc). Just roam and explore, u will find surprises in every corner. Stuff mostly for kids and women, not so much for men. Chanced upon a mall that sell nothing but children clothes. They are meant to be for wholesale and pre-order but they do sell single pieces too. Saw so many of these children clothes selling at Doota Mall (Dongdaemun) at double or triple the price. Be sure not to buy them at Doota. There is also another mall that sells just clothes for adults. It’s hard to give directions as they are like hidden gems amongst the many street stalls. If u happen to be in the mall selling jewelry, don’t be alarm if the stall owners refuse to sell single pieces to you. They are for bulk purchases and pre-order. You are lucky if u found a couple of friendly ones that don’t mind selling the jewelry in pieces to you. The hair clips especially are very pretty."
65,1.0,"Full of low quality overpriced Chinese products, people shoving and elbowing without pause, nasty fermented Korean food smells, and rats all over the place."
66,5.0,"Namdaemun market feels like a friendly street market environment, which is a welcome reprieve  from other ""pushy"" and rude again markets in other Asian countries.  Go and sample delicious street cuisine and explore various clothing stalls to find something unique."
67,4.0,There are several markets in Seoul this one has a nice verity but I found the prices higher than some of the more specialized markets.That being said the food options were good and there was lots of interesting items for sale.
68,2.0,"Huge area, many multi store buildings. Most of the merchandise is junk, just there is really  really, really many kinds and piles of junk."
69,4.0,This is a very large market in Seoul where you can find pretty nearly any item you can imagine. It is somewhat like organized chaos! It is worth strolling through the market even if you aren't interested in shopping just to see the spectacle of it.
70,4.0,Must visit in Seoul if you want try some Korean food in traditional small restaurant like kimchi dumpling a bimbimbapMany souvenir shop a money changer with good rate
71,5.0,"This is a large and busy market. Lots of clothes, food, souvenirs, toys, and housewares. I did not see much in the way of art (like you would get at Insadong). Definitely a good choice for a market experience. It is also an easy walk to Sungnyemun Gate which is a great photo spot juxtaposing history with modern."
72,3.0,"Well, it's a street Bazaar. I've seen a lot of bazaars but I've never seen people as unfriendly as here. Incredible.The quality of all things is not good but a bit cheaper than somewhere else..."
73,5.0,"Very traditional in style and setup. Available stuff - pin to plane. All authentic and Korean made items would be found here. People are relatively friendly to foreigners. Unlike myeongdong, bargaining is acceptable to some extent. Look around for Tshirts , shoes, jackets and random stuff. One can easily get lost in these market lanes for hours together. A must visit place in Seoul."
74,5.0,"Excellent markets with everything you can think of, from clothing and shoes to fresh foods, seafood and everything in-between.Too much to list, and prices can be negotiated slightly.Only 500m walk from Seoul subway station (line 4)Well worth a visit....""Shop Till You Drop"" :)"
75,5.0,Great place for street food and shopping. Make sure to get there early. For some reason they close quicker than other night markets.
76,4.0,"This place is a shopping haven. You can buy ref magnets, keychains and other korean souvenirs for a cheap bargain. This is a crowded place so be sure to be extra careful. This is a great place for pasalubongs!!"
77,4.0,"Street food here is quite good, I sampled tons. Didn't buy anything besides food. Lots of stuff you don't need: clothes, souvineers, shoes - I didn't need any of that stuff so I just looked mainly at the food!"
78,3.0,Not much different than the markets you can find in most of the World's cities 😁 Lots of stalls selling the same thing. I tried some fried dumplings.. the woman tried to get me to buy 4 instead of the 2 I asked for.. so I didnt ask to buy the other things I wanted as she had soured our deal 😠
79,4.0,Huge market are with variety of shops including wholesale stores. Prepare the get lost in the alleys. Good place for souvenir shopping.
80,3.0,This was fun to walk around and gain steps. Not as nice as it has been in the past. Could have been due to very cold temps. Vendors did not seem interested in bargaining. Still fun to walk around.
81,5.0,"I am not a shopper, rather I love street food and this market did not disappoint. Fried shallot pancakes for 1000W, intestine skewers for 500W (less gross than it sounds) and an entire alley selling noodles, soups, Chinese cuisine, dumplings and more.If you are visiting nearby attractions such as City Hall and Deoksugung palace, this is a great spot to stop for a quick bite to eat and souvenir shopping, everything from Ginseng to tailor made clothing. The restaurant I went to for noodles had tetra(?)lingual menus (Kor, Jap, Chn, Eng) with the wifi password displayed - food was reasonably priced, tasty, and tourist friendly."
82,4.0,"I think you can buy just about anything here - household pots and pans, clothing, food. I enjoyed wandering but didn't buy anything as most were not authentic souvenirs, just inexpensive stuff."
83,4.0,"It was a very diverse market, lots of bags, clothes, scarves, Baby clothes, and if you go inside the building in the side street the wholesalers are in there. Lots of market stalls that sells almost anything and everything from food, ginseng,clothes accessories, etc."
84,5.0,"Went there alone while husband was working.Love the street market, cheap clothes... everything was cheap.Broochs are cheap here... just go to 2nd floor of E-World shopIf you wanna bring home some gifts for your girl friends or sister, just go to the E-World, they sell whole sale stuff and a cheaper price."
85,4.0,My favorite meal in Korea was in this market.  I ate standing up at a street dumpling restaurant.  They were making the dumplings right there- so fresh and delicious.I kept going in circles and finding myself right back in a spot I had already visited.
86,2.0,"Although i have visited Seoul several times, this is the first time I visited Namdaemun. It was quite crowded. Most shops sold clothes and souvenirs, not up to my interest."
87,4.0,"They seemed to have some more traditional foods.  I didn't see any chicken skewers, meatballs, or fried chicken.  One really popular item was a stuffed pancake with mungbean, I think its called a Hotteok.  There was also a dumpling stall I liked."
88,4.0,"Interesting market, bustling with people, food, goods and some! Goods and food of all kinds in a block! Good to walk and talk a look!"
89,4.0,"This market was peaceful during the day I was there.  Decent place to shop and great variety of street food.  While it can be crowded, going during the week it isn't so bad."
90,5.0,"I strolled the Namdaemun Markets for 2 days. First day, already late so many shops ready to close. The next day, re-visit & buy a few souvenir.There is a variety of hings sold in here."
91,3.0,"A great place to people watch, a lousy place to shop, unless you like crowded street markets.At mid-day, there were people everywhere with different sounds, smells and sights.  Neat to wonder thru, but not something I'm looking to purchase from."
92,3.0,"Lots of stuff can be bought here, but most of it is junk and quality is generally poor. I regard it as a remnant from the times that east-Asia was a synonym for cheap copies of expensive goods. Nowadays it (forntunately) is much more trendsetting and tech-crazy, but this is not reflected here..."
93,1.0,It's full of cheap junks ... the area is a bit smelly too.  Not sure what the hype is about.  Seoul offers many other better markets and spots to visit than this dated corner.
94,4.0,"It was a good experience to wander around, you can buy all souvenirs and have lunch here. Can be the most economic way for shopping but consider it's still seoul not anything like Thailand etc. There is bargaining option but not more than 10-15 percent... still worth visiting for sure"
95,4.0,"Like many markets in Asia, feels more as a combination of streers than a market with stalls like in other places in Asia.Worth a visit, but don't expect to be blown away. Prices are ok, but no cheaper than other places in Seoul. Colorful place for some nice pics."
96,3.0,Many small shops with lots of things to sell. Many street-food restaurants. I would say the market in Daegu is bigger and offers more.
97,4.0,"It is the largest traditional market in Korea with shops selling various products. Amazing vibrant place. It's where a local Korea shop and tourist purchase  cheap goods. It's a great place to immerse yourself with the local culture. It's a very expansive place to truly explore and get lost in the many nook and crannies and the different alleys. It is also a great place to have traditional Korean dishes and street food vendors at an affordable price. If there is a long line at a food stall, it usually is worth it. Nearest Subway Line 4 Namdaemun Station Exit 5. The market is even open overnight from 11p - 4am."
98,3.0,Huge market with everything. The same things at day and night market. A must If you are turist. One of the largest
99,5.0,"Not to be missed is the Namdaemun Market, located next to the Great South Gate, after which it is named. It's the oldest and largest market in South Korea, dates back to 1414.It sells everything from housewares and fabrics to flowers and stationery. The multi-storey buildings offer thousands of shops, as well as endless numbers of street-vendor stalls and great food stalls to refresh and eat tasty local snacks!"
100,4.0,"I went there for a couple of hours, it was very hot though, but i enjoyed a lot of very delicious streetfood and people watching. I guess it is paradise once it is a bit colder:-) definitely a must see!"
101,5.0,This market is gold if you like to shop and eat. Lots of thing to buy....make sure you visit the hidden malls there. The entrance is sometimes hard to find but it's worth it you try to find them. Go in the afternnon!
102,3.0,I went here alone to buy some souvenirs. Lots of bargains everywhere and its quite cheap too! It's the largest market in Korea I also got lost strolling around. Haha
103,3.0,"More than 10,000 small shops located in here doing wholesale of items like socks, kitchenware etc. I think it is good for housewife to search for cheap household items here but not quite sure what to buy for tourists."
104,3.0,I thought this would offer more than it did and found it hard to find the area with mens clothing and other things I was shopping for. There are plenty of markets in Seoul that all sell the same stuff but are smaller and easier to navigate
105,3.0,"I was expecting the merchants to be out front trying to entice me to come into their store and take a look around.  I walked up and down the main street of the market (early evening) and not a single vendor spoke to me as most seemed to be content playing on their cell phones.  Oh well, I ended up getting out of there on the cheap."
106,4.0,I thought this market was very interesting. It was a South East Asian style outdoor  market in a modern city. Provided a good juxtaposition. Also lots of tasty Korean food available for reasonable prices. Would recommend a visit.
107,4.0,"Found new made Hanbok for toddlers at US$6, not for us adults as it's not worth getting..US$300.FRI night, there were street food and crowded with traditional push cart vendors. Great to see & buy."
108,4.0,"Same as myeondeong and crowded there, just here the clothes are not follow the fashion styles but here you may get many souveniers at reasonable price and you may tteobukki and odeng there..good taste made by ajjuma"
109,4.0,"I've been visiting Namdaemun since I can remember. My mom used to take me here middle of the night to shop and I always had so much fun! There's everything from clothes, bags, shoes, souvenirs, blankets, interior decorations, plates/bowls/utensils, food, restaurants and etc. There are endless carts of food and a restaurant alley. You will NOT be hungry while visiting Namdaemun. Burn off the calories by shopping outside or inside different buildings. It's always busy and crowded so try to visit in the morning when there are less people. You can also try to bargain and get cheaper prices if you ask nicely. :) They also sell cheaper Korean traditional souvenirs so buy gifts here! (I saw the same items at Insadong which was way more expensive.) Namdaemun brings back memories so I always make time to visit and look around."
110,4.0,One of the best to experience the Korean culture and a lot of cheap finds for your everyday needs. I suggest to visit this place during daytime.
111,4.0,"For a first time visitor from New Zealand, this market was astounding.Sprawling a number of blocks, there are stalls in the streets, inside buildings, upstairs, downstairs, everywhere!You can buy clothing, food, kitchen goods, gifts and just about anything.It does get a bit repetitive, however keep moving forward and you are bound to find that special purchase! P.S. if you get lost (which you will) there are ambassadors at certain points with maps able to help."
112,4.0,"I ate amazing street food in this market.  I also was able to get a ton of souvenirs for very cheap.  There's lots of clothes, ginseng vendors, and leather goods here.  Stuff is cheap, but know what you're getting in to."
113,4.0,Lots of food stalls and plenty of options.As a caution be ready to take risk as sometimes you can find strange foods in the market .
114,4.0,"This market is so huge with hundreds of small booths and stores. It changes on a daily basis with different items sold in the aisles of the market. While tourists come here, it is definitely a market that the locals visit. Besides tourist type souvenirs, it sells white goods, food, clothing, shoes, athletic items, Korean cosmetics, jewelry, and about anything you can think of. The market is noted for selling eye glasses. This may seem like something unusual to sell at a market, but the glasses are very reasonable and are normally made for you in 60 minutes.My first experience with the market was an eye glass purchase. The optician was able to do an eye exam to get my prescription and then make the glasses which I picked up about 60 minutes later. The cost was $60 and this included transitional lenses. At home I paid about $250 for these same glasses.There are many food booths in the market where you can watch the cooking. By the length of the lines at these booths, you can see the popular food items. I spend a few hours here. It's easy to reach by subway or taxi. There are also stores on the busy street in front of the market. This is a day time market. It seems like most shows close by 6:00 or 7:00 pm."
115,3.0,"I was told to check this market out as they supposedly had better prices for glasses than Myeongdong.  While I did see a few shops,  I saw no where near the concentration of shops and styles that I saw in Myeongdong.  Also,  I have always bought my glasses there and always had a good experience.  So, I decided to stick with Myeongdong.  Since glasses were out,  I decided to check out the rest of the market.  Honestly,  I think the market is better suited for locals (which isn't a bad thing mind you) but if you're looking for fashion (which I was), I thought it was geared to an older crowd.  You can buy local textiles,  trinkets,  etc but I just wasn't feeling it.  I guess a good contrast would be Ameyoko in Japan.  Now,  that market had charming side alleys filled with cozy restaurants,  bars,  as well as a good mix of merchandise.  If you're in Seoul,  feel free to check out but if you're looking for cheap fashion,  head to Sinchon/Gangnam Underground/Ehwa University (especially if you're a woman), Gasan Digital Complex or Dongdaemun."
116,2.0,"This market was over advertised leading to my disappointment. First of all, it closes around dinner time (say 7:30 pm ish) and as a major tourist attraction, that's too early.  The merchandise is relatively low quality.  Most of the items cost us approx Cdn $ 10 here in Toronto but they want 50% or more money.  Myeongdong and SamCheongRo are both better shopping venues in my opinion."
117,4.0,And so came away happy.  Rather a large sprawling place with much variety.  Persistence and patience will win out.  Worth a visit.
118,5.0,"It's a very lively place. If you want to shopping with very good price, should go this market. It's the biggest market in seoul. You can enjoy eating (there are tons of foods), buying souvenirs, clothing, accessories, shoes, bags & many things.Highly recommend!!"
119,5.0,"Just outside of Hoehyun subway is the Namdaemun market. You can get almost everything here;- leggings, pants, sweaters, fur coats ( genuine??), cosmetics, kids clothes, cameras, watches, traditional medicine, korean kitchenwares, just to name a few. Price range could be as low as W1000. There are street food stalls in one area too. Its just behind the SHINSEGAE store."
120,5.0,This is a massive market and hard to navigate around but well worth a visit. Don't go too early because many stalls do not open until 10am.
121,5.0,The most comprehensive and cheap market I found in Seoul. Buy socks! Shoes also a bargain. Other items can be hunted out if you take the time.
122,2.0,"I came here in search of craft materials. I suggest going to the information booth to get a map of the shops and what they carry. I was disappointed in the quality of the goods sold here. It has a very flea market feel. Overall, there were mostly just trinkets and tacky clothes. The only things I liked was one stall with beautiful embroidered tops for 10,000 won, the huge Alpha (art/office/stationery store), cute socks everywhere for 1,000 won, and a stall with dried fruits."
123,4.0,This market is so huge & such an eye opener. There's something for everyone. One recommendation is the small food alley serving authentic korean dishes at astonishing 'market prices'. A superb experience to eat like a local. Best to go early before the tourists crowd come and the afternoon heat (on a summer day). Highly recommended!
124,5.0,"THe market has everything you need. Cheap clothes, lots of different street food, souvenirs, coffee shops....it's a quite big area and even thought there are quite a lot poeple it doesn't feels very crowded. Very recommended."
125,3.0,"Goodies at Namdaemun market are inexpensive but also rather touristy. Nothing interesting really. The only thing I recommend for this place is the small food alley. There are a dozen of food stalls inside. The name of which I could not remember, but I have had a pretty tasty meal there. The set includes boribap (barley rice bibimbap), kalguksu (thick noodle soup), naengmyeon (cold noodle), kimchi and soup, and it was only 5500 wons. Inexpensive but delicious!  To go to Namdaemun, take subway to Hoehyeon station."
126,3.0,It was heavily snow  when I visit so it wasnt a good experience for me. i prefer Myoendong. Maybe it will e better in summer or autumn time.
127,5.0,"Huge market with Korean and imported goods. Endless supply of jewelry, bags, sunglasses, cosmetics and souvenirs. Many of the retailers are willing to negotiate prices"
128,5.0,"Close to one of the historical gates, you will find an extensive market to explore. Both above and below ground, search out everything from souvenirs, fur coats, custom designed jewelry, giant cans of American coffee (at 5x the normal cost), and dishes to spam, bargain clothes, ginseng products, and local cuisine. The fun is in finding the treasures hidden in cramped spaces and then bargaining for a better deal. I would consider this market a must see for travelers needing to take back a bit of Korea and who want a great story to share. Warning: The market does get crowded, stores are very cramped and the smells can be overwhelming at times (especially for those not used to it). Use caution if you don't care for people invading your personal space quite extensively. Mind you....the time of day can sometimes change this factor but be prepared either way."
129,4.0,"The best place to come for cheap shopping and getting souveneirs at half of the prices in other popular tourist attractions (looking at you, Insadong). If you're so inclined you can even haggle for greater discounts. Sells just about everything under the sun in a collection of different buildings dedicated to different types of items such as jewellery, crafts, and stationery. You can get lost here and never come out. Make sure to visit a information desk to get a map and directions straight toward what you'd like to purchase."
130,5.0,"For Tourists to Seoul, this is an ideal spot to do some cheap shopping.   Many stalls with clothes, shoes, handbags, souvenirs, traditional korean Ginseng, Tea,  herbs etc and also some food stalls.    Be prepared to deal with a crowd as it is also very popular with the locals.  Prices much cheaper than in shops in the main shopping precints"
131,3.0,"If the cheap stuffs herr will be china and very expensive if u compared w other place sell chinese stuffs, if expensive will be korean made and these stuffs nice but expensive"
132,4.0,Namdaemun is a great market near the Hoehyeon Station on Line 4 of the Seoul subway system.  It's an extremely crowded area so it's not for everyone.  The market sells a large variety of items.  I was able to buy Tommy Hilfiger socks for $2 USD/pair.  The highlight was eating deep fried japchae (I attached a picture of it).  It only cost $1 USD but it was VERY delicious.  It's definitely a must eat item at the market.  The vendors who sold it were near one of the market's entrances.
133,4.0,"various intersecting streets, mostly clothes but also jewelry, kitchenware and food.Take a breath and walk into one of those places that display the PIG's LEGS on the outside booth... it is nice and definitely an experience.Also, on the clothes side, they have this alley with all kind of military wares, US,  interesting, some even genuine...WORTHA VISIT !!!  OR TWO ..."
134,3.0,"Namdaemun market has every cheap things you might want to get. There are so many choices of goods but I opine that the quality might resemble the price. I was more attracted on getting street foods, which are available in other markets as well."
135,4.0,"This market is delightful. With loads of food stalls (with chairs at most of them) you can wander and eat to your hearts content. There are also a couple of bathrooms in the market (not well marked) and free wifi. For a wacky experience, try the octopus for 15000won. It is still wiggling on the plate and the tentacles kind of 'nip' at the inside of your mouth. The locals will be impressed to see foreigners eating this dish and will probably giggle at you then offer you a sip of Soju."
136,4.0,"I am not a big shopper so I rushed through this area. However, shopaholics will find it interesting and there are plenty of different Korean snacks to tempt you as well. It seems a good place to grab some souvenirs as well."
137,5.0,Kilometres of vendors hawking everything from houseware to clothing. Great finds. And great street food. Just try to not get lost in the maze.
138,4.0,"Even if you do not buy a thing, this is another place in Seoul to learn about Korean culture, its food and retail culture. A good place to sample baked goods and other food sold by street vendors. In this market the number of vendors is vast."
139,4.0,"If you like to interact with a traditional generation of Korean people, have cheap but tasty eats, and buy cheaper goods; then this is the place to visit.  Convenient, as it is pretty close to Seoul train station, Seoul Metro and other Major Tourist spots of Seoul.  The shopkeepers show interest in foreign tourist and beckon you to shop in their stores.   The goods are not the best of quality, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.    Cheap T-Shirts, Korean Cosmetics, Korean Spices, Imitation Jewelry, Korean Cut Suits, etc can be purchased here.  I did not see anyone bargain here.    There are many cheaper but tasty Korean style restaurants here where the owners tolerate foreigners.  From here, if you feel like splurging the Lotte Stores are a short walk away.   Funny how cheap can turn to expensive in a few blocks.   The market is right across from the famous Namdaemun Gate.  The Seoul City Tour bus stops here.  Many electronics stores are also here.   It will be a great way to spend a lazy weekend afternoon here without hurting the wallet."
140,4.0,"After reading the latest reviews, had to see for myself what Namdaemun Market is about. Yes, I agree it is a must visit place just to experience the vibe and traditions. Somewhat touristy, but then I was a tourist! A place full of knick knacks, clothes, accessories and street food.One thing to note on my visit on a Monday afternoon, before 4 pm, the middle of the pedestrian street was pretty much unoccupied.  After having a local meal of cold noodles in a restaurant outside of the pedestrian area (also many outdoor clothing and gear shops) in the surrounding main street, found the whole pedestrian street had transformed and packed with stalls end to end. Thought I had went back to a different street!Mind you, the stalls and shops are quite repetitive with similar goods on offer, but that's where you get your bargaining power!"
141,5.0,I loved! The place I liked most in Seoul. Have some money 'cause even if you are not a buyer you will buy something. It's really nice to get lost in the tiny streets and see where locals eat and what they buy. A must see in Seoul.
142,2.0,Wanted to browse around at the end of my day but when I arrived at 21.00 all stalls where closing down. Was a bit of a disappointment to me. I am sure it will be nice during the day.
143,4.0,"More a shopping area with thousands of stalls and shops. Worth a visit, as it is for locals and for tourists. You can bargain with some of the vendors."
144,4.0,"I found this by accident but liked it - also nearby is a shoe shop strip with about 15 different shoe shops - average price$65,000 yuan . The market was alive with plenty going on . In the middle is a ship that sells pretty cool Leather jackets. Lots going on here but allow almost a day to do it properly"
145,4.0,Namdaemun market is the biggest market in northern side (old side) of Seoul.It is next to many shopping areas and close to major hotels and easy to walk and shop.The area is safe for tourists and easy to get along.
146,2.0,"Lived in Seoul for one year and didn't like this market much. There is one little alley I liked visiting for noodles that was sort of tucked away from tourists but the main drag is just too much for me. Too many fake bags, knock off items, hasseling, etc."
147,5.0,"whereever you see here are shops, typically clothes, bags, and local food and snacks. for shopaholic it is recomended for its bargainable prices."
148,3.0,"I visited in the late morning and can well imagine that it is popular and can get very crowded in the evenings and weekends.Items here are mostly relatively cheap clothing, toys and items, mostly made in China.  But do take the time to wonder around, especially heading to the upper floors of the buildings.  On the third floor of D building and the adjacent block, which is connected by a corridor, I found a whole series of shops selling kitchenware like ceramic plates, cutlery and pots and pans.  There were every imaginable size of US-made cast iron pans, and I was interested in several polished wood serving platters, though they were rather expensive.  If you pay by cash rather than using a credit card, there is some room for negotiation.If you are lost, there are a couple of information booths dotted around, though the staff I spoke to had a little difficulty in conversing in English.  But they provided me a guide of the area and a general sense of direction to find what I wanted.At a basement of a building near block D, there were a few stalls selling antique watches and cameras, though I could not say much about the authenticity, as I am no expert.  There are also a couple of areas where they sell leather handbags and toys, as well as a wholesale market for jewellery and accessories.Once you are done here and want to spend whatever cash you have left in your wallet, head to the neighbouring Shisegae luxury departmental store and also out its food market."
149,4.0,Namdaemun market is a huge market in the center of Seoul. You can find anything you want in this market! However you can get lost very easily!
150,3.0,It's a big shopping area but I find it mainly catered to the older crowd. There's some stalls selling souvenirs which is cheaper to the nearby Myeongdong shopping area.It's worth a visit if you're in the area.
151,3.0,"It is a large market however it is also very easy to navigate. A tourist information is located not far away from the market entrance, where in you can get free market maps and ask away any inquiry with regards to the market on the personnel on duty. I also like that locals also frequented this Market, so in a way you'll have a glimpse of  the Korean culture. Though it is considered as a tourist spot, the prices of the goods are very inexpensive. The street food, YES this is one of the most fascinating view that you will see while strolling in the market. It offers a wide variety of street foods for tourist like me to experience and taste an affordable yet sumptuous and authentic Korean food."
152,4.0,Many thing's can be found at here with reasonable price compare with other place like Myeongdong and Gangnam
153,3.0,"Less glamorous than the other markets this market has loads of cheaply made and priced goids as well as your ""I Heart Korea"" t-shirts. At the foit of the mountain to N Seoul Tower, by a city wall gate, and near other markets. Namdaemun market is worth a walk through, but not a major stop."
154,3.0,I bought the Korea souvenier shirt here for only 10000 won for three shirts. I found the same shirts being sold at Dongdaemun for 4000 won each but without plastic wrap. The bags are also expensive on this area. I probably expected that the prices are really low.Im not really a fan of this market as most of the clothes that they are selling are not for young people. The namdaemunmarket is only 5-7 minutes walk away from Myeongdong shopping area.
155,3.0,"This place has a lot tourists, taking pictures of everything.  At the center of the market, expanding out to the entrances, the center of the walk way is the food venders.  I was surprised to find out they sell handmade noodle, made right at the booth!  Costed me 5000 won for the noodle with two wontons, not bad at all!"
156,4.0,"Was here for the souvenirs. Its cheap here as compared to myeongdong. There are a lot of things here. If you want to buy a lot, you can negotiate with the seller for cheaper price. Dun forget to say, Discount juseyo, ahjumma? Sometimes it works wonders. Its a big place, so remember where you are going and where did you start before getting into this place. Well, i got lost but luckily found the tourist center."
157,3.0,"The whole market sells ginseng and some other Korean specialties. If you want to buy, should check the price and type before you come here. Must bargain a lot and if you don't know the type you may buy a cheap type with expensive price. Research at home :)"
158,5.0,"At first, I thought this might be more of a tourist attraction / trap than a local market. Instead, it turned out to be a fantastic experience packed with locals eating, drinking, and shopping. I purchased some Korean snacks and dishes at a good price. I also found the rice noodles with chili sauce that I had been looking for. There are dozens of places to eat, and it seemed that the merchants were excited to serve foreigners. I almost didn't come here as I was running out of time, but it turned out to be the highlight of my day."
159,3.0,"I freely admit street markets are not really my thing. I found this one to be interesting to look at and walk through and the food looked interesting too. Very few of the offerings had any english description (which is fine) but it meant I wasnt really brave enough to eat something that was not immediately identifiable! Certainly some weird and wonderful things on offer. The wares of the area seemed mostly to me to be cheap, unappealing knock offs of designer brands or the usual market type stuff. So it was a great area to look at but I kept my money in my pocket."
160,5.0,"This market offers so much to the average tourist, as well as to the locals.  You can buy hot food, souvenirs, toys, clothes, shoes, and even luggage - all within walking distance from the subway station.  When the sun went down and the lights came on, the streets were all lit"
161,5.0,"This is a sprawling market that appears to sell everything! Clothes, kitchen utensils, hats, a huge jewelry section, lots of food stalls.... It's a really great place for souvenirs. This is a place where you can spend a lot of time exploring, I wondered around taking in the"
162,3.0,Quite a big area with small shops full with clothes and a lot of other stuff and trinkets. Espacially small and special things you can find here. Do not expect original main brands. There is also a big flower market. Eating food is not really recommended espacially if it is not
163,3.0,"Since my ""hotel"" was situated right in the heart of Namdaemun Market, I couldn't avoid the area.  If I recall, most of the shops are still selling ""more or less"" the same items as they did 9 years ago.  Goods are cheap and are catered toward the locals.  The restaurants pretty"
164,4.0,"I went here not knowing what to expect, at first it thought I would just be seeing seafood and fruits on the street but was surprised that they have everything here. Too bad i was overwhelmed with all those stuffs and didnt know which one to get. Prices here are not that cheap"
165,4.0,they have a huge camera store streets with various service centers so must visit if you are looking to get your lenses or sensors cleaned. This place is famous for ggul hoddeok (korean honey pancakes) so try few. There is a famous dumpling place nearby the subway exit. Not as touristy as dongdaemun but it has its charms. There is a soongryemun (gate) to check out also.
166,3.0,If you're looking for food or general nick nacks to take home this market has everything. Give yourself time though as you could literally spend days here
167,5.0,"I got a pair of prescription eyeglasses at Karl Optical here in Namdaemun Market. I really like my glasses and they were way more affordable here vs. buying in the states.  I didn't need an eye exam because I had a copy of my prescription from my eye doctor.  The optician took the time to measure my eyes to make sure my glasses fit my face correctly and that I could see clearly.  My prescription is complicated so it took 3 days, still faster than in the states.  If your prescription is simple you can get glasses the same day."
168,4.0,"It had a good blend of everything,  nor over priced and value for money.  Definitely a place to visit when in Seoul"
169,5.0,"The problem with Seoul is that nearly all of it is new, techno-architecture.  not for nothing is it known as 'soulless Seoul'.  But the Namdaemun Market is a step away from the hyper-modern facades and towering modern glitz.  As with the market streets in istanbul, there are streets in this market that specialise in what they sell- watches and cameras, antiques, silver, furniture, and so on.What is particularly fascinating are the narrow internal alleys where food is cooked for the traders, with one alley specialising in fish, then being whisked away to the various punters.There are, inescapably, the mid-street and corner vendors, plying the same game that such cutlers and pan-sellers do the world over - provide you with a lively commentary with practical applications of their knife-sharpeners, pans, cleaning products- whatever it may be.  And you don't have to understand or speak a word of Hangul to enjoy the show.You'll need at least 3 hours to have a slow mooch round, and there are plenty of stalls selling such delights as ginger and lemon tea with crushed ice, but using root ginger and whole lemons - for 3,000 Won (£2, $3, 3 Euros), plus wonderfully chewy gooey stuffed sweet dumplings for a similar price - you won't go hungry."
170,4.0,"This market has a history that dates back to the mid-1960s.  Actually, the term market is a bit of an understatement considering its size - it's not only quite spread out, consider that it also encompasses the many floors of the buildings that dot the area.  When you should visit depends on what your intention is.  Most visitors will probably find that they get their best shopping done between dawn and dusk.  This is when most of the retail shops are open at ground level.  In terms of variety, it's very extensive and can rival Chatuchak in Bangkok - check out the market's website to get an idea of where the various shops can be found.  Being a market, food's not really far away and stalls sell a variety of finger food or snacks as well as no-frills sit-down meals cooked on the spot.  The food stalls go on after dark as well, so this is a reasonable place for dinner although it's best to go as a small group in order to try a wider range of dishes.  Once the retail stalls close for the evening, wholesale business starts in earnest in the buildings around the main market area and carries on till dawn.  It's quite a scene although not likely to be as entertaining to tourists as the daytime activities.The best subway station to reach Namdaemun market is via Hoehyeon station.  Exiting the station, gates 5 and 6 of the market are more or less directly opposite while gate 4 is a short walk further down the road."
171,4.0,"This is a large, both open air and building marketplace, where many Korean consumers and wholesalers go to buy primarily clothing - most of it is relatively cheap and much of it is pretty tacky.  But if you are into nylon and polyester, this is the place for you!  On the other hand, if you need emergency clothing to get you through your stay in unexpectedly cold or rainy Korea, this place could be a godsend.  And if you are looking for something truly kitsch for the next party back home, look no further. But it's not all clothing.  There is string of camera shops, a couple of blocks long, that run along the main street that serves as the northern boundary of the market.  If you are looking for good values in used lenses and cameras, this is an excellent place to hunt and bargain.  New equipment is also available.  Be it new or used gear, I suggest first checking out Amazon.com and see what are the going prices, then roughly convert 1,000 won to the US dollar and use that knowledge as benchmarks for your bargaining.  Most camera shops are hones,t but there are at least a few owners more than willing to take advantage of the naive foreigners who either do not know what they want and/or have not done their pricing homework.  But with a little homework, this a great place to buy photographic gear."
172,4.0,"This was one of the ""standard"" stops on a tour I booked.  Although I'm not a shopper, I did enjoy the wide and diverse scope of this sprawling flee market.  It was interesting also to watch all the goings on and interactions among the shoppers and the vendors."
173,3.0,A market as many others.If you around you can have a walk around it.It's just next to the okd city gate.
174,2.0,"Don't waste your time here. I walked through a big swathe of the market to get from the Namdaemun Gate to the subway station at Hoehyeon and saw nothing but stalls selling handbags, shoes, socks and random assortments of $2 shop junk. There was no atmosphere, no unique or special products on sale - just the same stuff you can buy anywhere else in Seoul for the same prices. Definitely one to avoid."
175,4.0,"This market was easily accessible from the metro line and a short distance from the nearby Korean castle (Sungnyemun Gate). You may use the Seoul City Bus tour stop to also access this market, but ask for directions.It is a long street with shops and tables lined in front of the shops, exhibiting all sorts of things to buy. From gifts, toys, crafts and even food as some restaurants are available along the street. I only managed to do one section of the street, but I was able to find the Korean curio gifts I was looking for. You can bargain for a better price and with the local people also walking around, it was very interesting and fun.I would recommend this as a must do activity when in Seoul."
176,3.0,"Went to the market while hunting for a camera. I wasn't disappointed as there are some great camera shops there. If you want some traditional street food then this could also be a great market for you. There were a lot of very cheap clothing stores, but that's not really my thing. Overall it's worth a visit, especially because it's right in the centre of town near City Hall."
177,4.0,"I liked the atmosphere. It was massive, and you may say that it was like any other markets with plenty of china made merchandise.The little restaurants were however unique and a gem of a find. I was travelling alone and on my adventerous streak. The restaurants displayed pictures with description in English so it was pretty easy for the traveller.Try the galchijorin, which I did. It was super good."
178,5.0,"This market is very enjoyable. Lots of different shops, all kind of shops, if you want clothes, shoes, hats, food, etc... and being in Korean style life, go there ! Worth it !"
179,5.0,"If you like Crowds, Shopping, Street Food, History and more Crowds, Namdaemun Market is the place for you.  This is an awesome place and it's huge.  This outdoor market is Korea's largest and oldest traditional market dating back 600+ years to 1414 when it opened next to the Great South Gate.  Get in there and hunt for bargains on clothing and many other items.  The choice of Food is endless and for the most part delicious.  Don't be intimidated and keep an eye out for the RED HATS, these are people dressed in Red that are there to help you find your way, they are very nice and extremely helpful.  So get in there and have fun."
180,3.0,"Did not find this market anything special, a lot of stalls selling the same stuff. Did no have much of an atmosphere either. So see it if you must."
181,5.0,"I love Namdaemun Market!  It's an amazing mix of culture, food and shopping.  I was in Seoul last September, and I went to Namdaemun Market almost every day, as it was a short walk from my hotel.  The food and shopping choices are almost endless, and you can still bargain a little with some of the vendors.  I particularly enjoyed strolling through the market in the evenings, as it really comes alive, and it was cooler than during the day.  The market is divided into sections - women's clothing, menswear, children's clothes, shoes, etc.  Look out for the volunteers wearing red hats - they can give you a map of the market, which makes it easier to find what you're looking for.  And don't forget to walk through and find the magnificent Great South Gate at one of the entrances to the market.  It's spectacular!"
182,4.0,Market located at Hoehyeon station; These are an open air local market where sell copied item/ clothes/shoes/bagsplus raw fabric and local food vendor sell such as variety fruit smoothie juice blended cupseafood kiosk restaurant and other meat grilled or fried stick.Fun time to wndered around here.
183,1.0,I went there today and I found it to be a sheer waste of my time. It had low grade goods and the place had a grubby feel about it. Moreover they do not have sizes for Westerners. I also had a meal at a traditional Korean restaurant down a side alley which is part of the market and the meal was awful with terrible Kimchi as well. I had the same meal in Yeokchon and it was quite tasty.
184,5.0,Lots of people koreans or not go shopping or eating in this famous market. Tourist information explains it exist a long time ago as a trading place for momgols russians and koreans. Lots of clothing and evrything else are sold in shops or in the middle of the street stalls. Many kinds of korean food can be tasted in special food alleys or corner carts. A very interesting place to visit on Monday when museums are closed.
185,4.0,"Love it!!! The best shopping area in Seoul, must know how to haggle though... Lots of nooks and crannies to explore. Better to go there on a weekday, to avoid weekend crowds."
186,4.0,"If you miss the ""Guang Zhang  Shi Chang"",may be you can try here.I believe there is not much different except the price!if you not ready to buy or bargain, please don't touch or ask the Ajuma to take for you, she will annoy you or even pat you,well sometimes is hurt but sometimes it wouldn't. i seldom buy souvenir, instead i bought clothes...haha.The price was acceptable after bargain. Oh, the food was nice too after tiring from bargain."
187,4.0,"In order to go there; it is better to learn some Korean words for bargaining, this is not the US or Europe where prices are not negotiable, people are friendly but you have to bargain a bit and a little bit of Korean will help. I bought most of my souvenirs from here, best deals in town and a huge selection."
188,3.0,I went there this afternoon but there was nothing to ser.lots of restaurants so there must be some activity some time.
189,4.0,"I went there on a Saturday afternoon. I didn’t buy anything as I feel that they are all overpriced. However, I recommend you to try out the food. The foods that I see are typically cheaper than other location. I went into the noodle alley and ordered an ice noddle. It only cost 5500 won and I got kimchi, a noodle soup and the ice noodle. It was very nice and it cooled me down in the hot summer. Highly recommended."
190,3.0,"The market is very crowded in the afternoon. Things are of various origins, including Korea and China. The price is not very high if you succeeding in bargaining. For example, I bought a pack of 10 gifts for 8,000 KRW instead of 10,000 KRW (the listed price is the same among shops). You may even get a better deal by saying 6 or 7,000."
191,4.0,"Great market for gifts such as cell phone cases, local clothe, purses and all other types of shopping paraphanalia.  Beware, this is a very large market with hundreds of vendors, very much like a night market.  The food choices are very good and cheap, you should definitely give this place a shot if you want to do some cheap shopping in Seoul."
192,3.0,"There are several streets which make up the market area - a certain area may sell selective products only - i.e. woman's clothing, dry food products, or fresh food. The atmosphere is good, if you know what you are looking for, you may be able to negotiate a good price. Try the famous 'hotteok' (fried pancakes). Close by is the National Treasure #1 - the restored Namdaemun Gate (or more correctly: Sungnyemun)."
193,5.0,"Namdaemun has tons of goods ranging from Korean souvenirs and gifts, to clothing, shoes, and jewelry. There is SO much in this market. Theres got to be over 100 vendors. There are a few dozen streets located in the market, and they are all lined with the semi outdoor/indoor shops. This is the place to go if you want to get cheaper gifts and nice souvenirs to bring back home. Most of the stuff I brought home came from this market. A lot of the vendors are nice and they try their best to help you with what you need. I found about half the vendors spoke decent English, and the rest little to none at all.There are also a lot of food vendors with all of the traditional Korean street foods. They also have many places around to exchange money for Korean won, including older ladies who sit at little desks around the market, though I don't think they were giving people the best exchange rates.I went during the late morning/mid-day, and I think that's the best time to go. It wasn't busy at all in the morning, and as I was going to get lunch, it got a lot busier, especially for a mid-day.Overall, this is a must stop visit when visiting Seoul!"
194,2.0,"Namdaemun Market was, at least in April 2014, not the loud, crowded market as described in many guidebooks. The advice to go during the daytime to beat the weekend and late night crowds can be ignored. After 10pm, the place was pretty much dead with 80% of the shops closed. Sure, if you want to have a bite at one of the (tented) restaurants, no problem. For a shopping experience, you'd have to try during the day. Maybe things get more interesting in the summer..."
195,3.0,"I spent an enjoyable afternoon walking around this market, which was close by my hotel. I arrived into Korea from Taiwan, and was surprised by the sharp drop in temperature. I managed to find a coat at a reasonable price, and was impressed by the snappy and cheerful service, even though the young woman serving me spoke no English. The street stalls were interesting, and exotic food (to me, at least) stalls mixed with a variety of different places selling their wares. One tiny enclosure caught my attention, housing a man talking to two women. I don't know what was on offer, but I was impressed by the drive and entrepreneurialism of the man setting up his business with such little resource. The tiniest business I have ever seen! I enjoyed my walk, but have been in more interesting and lively street markets in Taiwan and China."
196,5.0,"Whatever you are looking for, you can probably find it here. Namdaemun Gate has been completely restored recently."
197,5.0,"Wanna buy anything...clothes (i mean everything u can dream to wear....from coats to lingerie), shoes/slippers, jewellery, Korean food (anything that breathes at all....including a humongous variety of the Korean Kimchi), snacks, goodies, electronics, cosmetics (hell with Korea for Cosmetics, fashion freaks)....and this list never ends.Just spread across a few streets, having around 6 - 7 entrance/exits...don get lost...have the map before you get there....was quite useful for me...cos...after 5 hrs of being in there...had no idea which was the entrance I got into.....Attached an image of the map along this review."
198,4.0,"I found Namdaemum market full of clothing stores for women. There are also a lot of shops selling household goods. There are a few shops on the periphery selling Cameras. On the whole, prices seem to be reasonable. Of course, the place is packed with people, people and more people. The subway is located next to the market. While there are a few places to eat, this is not the Myeong Dong Street food festival kind of a market. This is more a place for value shopping! Wish I could go there one more time!"
199,4.0,"I would divide the shops into 2 categories - those housed in the buildings and street stalls. Those in the former sold daily wear, mainly casuals and some office wear. Nothing fancy. Prices usually in the range of KRW 10k to 30k. Those in the street were the cheaper goods common in night markets. If you find something  you like,  it can be quite a steal. It's always crowded but those without a sense of direction do not have to fear as there are tourism volunteer guides at the end of the streets to help stray travellers out."
200,3.0,"Please note that this market is not 24 hours attraction so it's better to come as early as possible. I came here quite late in the afternoon so I only spent approximately 1.5 hours here (which wasn't quite long for a shopaholic like me).I was planning to buy some traditional souvenirs and hoping to get the best deals here. Well, what I can say is the variety isn't that much. I didn't know about the price since my Korea was terrible so most of the time I didn't do the bargain (or very limited bargain). If you couldn't speak Korean, it's better to bring your friends/relatives who understand so they could help you bargaining.However, I met a seller, a traditional cake seller, actually who greeted me in Bahasa. It was a surprise for me, so I decided to visit his stall (and end up bought 3 packs of cake). I forgot the name of the cake but it came in 3 flavors (original, peanut, and chocolate) and looked like 'mochi'. I got the discount from buying all the flavors. Perhaps if one day you visit Namdaemun market, you could meet this friendly cake seller."
201,4.0,Within walking distance from Seoul city hall and central station this market is a nice stop for traditional food (try the delicious small pancakes with sugar inside!) and cheap souvenir items. It can become very crowded here with tourists so go early in the morning when they have just opened. It can be a nice break after strolling through this bustling city that is Seoul.
202,4.0,"The market itself was fantastic. It was very busy (I went on a Saturday). The shop vendors are eager to charge more to tourists so make sure to practice your bartering beforehand, and know how much a product should cost before going in. The food was also incredible and a nice break after wandering aimlessly for a few hours. You will find everything at this market- from socks, shoes, clothing, toys, food, and more. Make sure you also bring loads of energy because the market is exhausting trying to maneuver around all the shoppers. I would not recommend bringing young children to the market if you are just visiting Seoul on a vacation, it was very busy and it would have worried me to keep an eye on kids. Good luck- go have a blast!"
203,3.0,"Everybody talks about the market at Namdaemun, which literally means the southern main gate. The huge market covers a large area, and consists of many narrow lanes. You will find numerous small shops and restaurants, but after a while, you will realize that they are rather similar. With little interest in shopping, this place did not appeal to me.I did have a simple meal there. I ordered a couple of different buns, including one stuffed with kimchi, on the menu with photos, but was offered a bowl of dumplings, which were as big as steaming buns. They were tasteless if not stale. I was disappointed, and suspected foul plays by all-women workers there. There was no point to argue about this. I was happy to find a metro station in the neighborhood."
204,3.0,"I would not miss the the Namdaemun market, it is a colorful and lively place. But, beware, I stopped by a T-shirt shop to get shirts for my kids. I picked a design and requested two shirts of different sizes. The owner folded the shirts and handed me a bag. Then I decided to get shirts for me and my wife and the owner added those to the bag. When I arrived at my hotel the bag had only 3 shirts. One of the kid shirts at the bottom of the bag could not be found and i would have to divide one shirt between my two kids. Shall I tell them what happened to me in Korea? I was ripped off by the owner, a nice and pleasant old guy."
205,1.0,"Ugly, Ugly, dirty uninteresting, full of clothes and shoes ordinary and insignificant, or even with areas of typical meals not waste your time, do anything else"
206,4.0,"Namdemun is what you make it; yes you won't find a lot of upscale items, but you will find some good souveniers, socks, bags, and SHOES!!!! These are the kind of fun, wear as you will shoes, not Jimmy Choo. If you wear a small size, have ""toy feet"", as my sons call my size 4 feet, this is the Mothership!  There are many shoe stores here,and the prices average about $25.00 a pair. I did bargain, and offered and got shoes for closer to 20.00 a pair. The ones I got had nice non--skid soles, were comfortable, and seemed to have some small amount of padding built in, at the heel and insole. There are lots of sport type shoes, and heels, as well. When I buy sandals at Kohl's,etc I do not find these features, so it made my purchases well worth it. It is best to just wander the market. I did buy shoes if I really liked them, as I wasn't sure i'd find them again, but I did shop the whole market.I noticed that in between the outdoor stalls, there were glass doors, and signs above saying 'Pier 50"", etc. I walked in, and figured out this is the wholesale jewelry area of Seoul. The ""pier"" numbered signs are to make it possible for accessory buyers to find the stores/stalls they are looking for. I did try to buy two rings, and though there was a language barrier, I was able to understand that they only sold wholesale quantities. :(So, the best of this market is socks,shoes and bags and purses. There was also clothing for ladies,but not junior sizes. After getting my shoes,and some cute footie socks, I took a taxi to Sinchon Ladies' Street, which is in the University area, and is good for junior clothing, makeup,and items for younger women, though nothing there for men.Tip: get hotel staff or someone who speaks and write Korean to re-write your destination info, and hand this to taxi drivers, subway and bus employees, who can help you find your destination, this way. I wrote the name and address in English, and they would translate it on the same paper, for me show those taking me to my destination.If you love fun,cute shoes, this is the place for you!"
207,4.0,"This place is easy to get lost in but once you've figured it out, you'll love it. I would go there to buy clothes mostly and I was rarely dissatisfied. I was once told that I was too big for a skirt that I wanted which was disheartening as there is no filter as to how the lady said it. I did buy the skirt and it fit fine but if tags my only complaint, it's a silly one. This place is great for shopping."
208,3.0,"If you looking for the wholesale merchandise and cheap price here the place you can find and you will experience real Korean livelihood.Otherwise,there're many shopping mall on each side of this market."
209,4.0,"I could get Japanese rice crackers, t-shirts, baseball caps.  There was a beggar that was very distressing.  Fun to see 2 outdoor chefs bantering in Japanese with tourists."
210,3.0,"I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting, but I wasn't really excited, either.  I visited on a Saturday night around 7:30PM.  I think I found about 50% of the market to be closed... or at least I think those parts were supposed to be a portion of the market.  I was lead to believe this would be bustling place... but I found it to be a bit dull and quiet.  I walked past dozens of stalls and shops selling the same dreary flea-market goods.  You can only see so many carts stacked tall with socks...I stopped at a food vendor near the station and had my dinner.  It was good, but perhaps a bit expensive.  (23k for a beer, 5 yakitori and a bit of bacon)"
211,4.0,"This market is in a very convenient location with a lot of shops. Many shops are setup in the alley and walkways between the building which is kind of interesting . I've bought a vintage watch there with  a very good deal. Make sure that you bargain as they seemed to overcharge for tourist. In general , a nice experience !"
212,4.0,"I visited Namdaemun market on a weekday. First thing I noticed is that most streets where open stores are were bare of street vendors. It was a different scene than most photos online. Not until close to 6PM, did the street vendors start setting up stands in the middle of the street. So if one wants to see a really busy Namdaemun market street, do not go too early.That is not to say there was nothing to see or buy. Almost all the stores on the street I visited had good price about 10-40% lower than stores in other places or even subway station. I didn't even need to haggle on price because the price was so low even locals paid up marked price without bargaining. The stores in the malls were another story. Following reviews from fellow reviewers, I tried to avoid the restaurants selling street food here. But there were some street food stands which sell traditional Korean street food, and the price was norm. Food was fresh and tourists and locals alike paid the same posted price at these street stands. The only reason why I only purchased a few items was because I noticed a very high percentage of things sold here are imported. There is nothing wrong with that, and most web sites described Naedaemun market clearly stated so. But I came from US where imports and made in US is plentiful, so I mainly look for made in Korea. That's the only reason why I took one star off. Namdaemun market is definitely a must go in Seoul. Just pay attention to what you buy and make sure you don't go home with a full suitcase of things made in china or made in your own home town :-)"
213,4.0,"The sights and sounds alone are reason enough to go to Namdaemun for a day. You can find almost anything here, including old ladies selling sushi out of bags on the street... Wouldn't necessarily buy those though...It's cheap, local, diverse and often crowded. Leave your iPod at the hotel and just soak up the atmosphere :-)Bring cash!!"
214,5.0,"Korea is known for its traditional markets due to its diversity, long cultural history and vibrant atmosphere. Namdaemun market is one of the most famous and largest traditional markets in Korea. Many people visit traditional markets to eat food, shop for groceries and other goods.  The Market is filled with people looking for different things and the Namdaemun market offers goods with cheap prices.  A definite cant=miss tourist spot in Korea!http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SH/SH_EN_7_2.jsp?cid=273760"
