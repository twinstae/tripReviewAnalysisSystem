0,4.0,"It has many well known Korean brands at one place and also in the basement there is a Kpop store. Honestly if the busy streets of Myeongdong are too much, it is a good way to still get some shopping done."
1,5.0,"As someone who is social media-savvy, I see a lot of Korean online stores that sell veryyy cute clothes. I couldn't buy them because I have trust issues with shipping companies esp. internationally. At this mall, the 3rd floor is specifically for their most famous online stores such as 3ce/Stylenanda and Chuu. At the most bottom floor, you can find a K-Pop shop that sells cheaper albums than the ones in Underground Myeongdong. They also have the older ones which the UM shops don't have as well as signed albums."
