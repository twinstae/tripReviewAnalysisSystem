0,4.0,"My family and I visited this shrine and were impressed with the beauty and history of the site that was easily accessible using public transportation and the price was affordable.  It can get hot, especially since the shrines are in wide-open spaces paved with stone, but the paths leading to the shrines are in the shade."
1,5.0,"The royal memorial site was filled with history and gorgeous outdoor scenery while still being centrally located within Seoul. Although we had to visit with a tour guide, I really enjoyed having someone so knowledgeable lead us around, teaching us about the historical significance of this special place. My son enjoyed being outdoors and made a game of avoiding stepping on the spirits’ pathway that runs through the property."
2,5.0,"Entrance to the Jongmyo (Chongmyo) Shrine usually requires a guided walking tour which takes roughly an hour. Timing was on our side as we arrived fifteen minutes before the start of the English walking tour at 2pm. I loved how low-key sassy our guide was as she inserted some colorful comments in her informative spiel. Watch out for the cobbled pathway as the middle column is reserved for ancestral spirits to pass by! Upon hearing about this, everyone from our group was so scared of stepping on the wrong lane that we'd just wait for the guide to walk first, and simply pattern our steps after hers.Entrance to this UNESCO World Heritage site is included in the all-palace access ticket that's worth 10000 KRW."
3,4.0,"Only guided tours ate allowed here. This is sacred to them so it really needs to be respected. We waited for the English tour for about 30 minutes.The tour lasts for about an hour. It was quite informative. The whole grounds was beautiful quiet and relaxing. If you ate coming here, you schedule it with the other nearby palaces in one day. Just be ready for a full day's walk."
4,4.0,Please check the time before go as only tour is allow. Anywhere it's a free tour. We are lucky as we know chinese and english cause the tour is 1 hours each switch between chinese and english. Even though not able to enter the shrine building but the view is nice and we got a lot of history information of Korea.
5,4.0,"The buildings and scenery are very calming and serene. Walk through the park and imagine the spirits walking next to you. There's a short 13 min movie that plays on a loop in the park to educate you on the history. The cost for my wife, son and I was about $3 us. Sat and Mon you don't need a guide. All other days you do. Glad we did it."
6,3.0,"KRW 1000 (US$1) admission.  Free tours in English most days of the week beginning at noon.  If staying nearby, this makes an excellent first stop since the guide explains much of ancient Korean history, belief and culture.  Will add context to the rest of your sightseeing!"
7,3.0,"We lucked out on the timing of our visit as we arrived a few minutes before a tour (in English) was due to start. (From what I could tell they only offer one to two tours a day in English with the rest being in Korean) Anyway, attending a tour is the only way to see the shrine as entry is extremely limited due to the sacred nature of the site. While our guide did her best to explain to us the historical and spiritual significance of this place, she spoke so rapidly and with such an accent we were lucky to catch even a word or two every sentence. Not her fault as her English was much better than our Korean but it really detracted from the overall experience. Overall, an audio guide tour with docents along the way ensuring you did not trod in any incorrect stones, would have gone over much better. (There are quite a few places where you are not allowed to walk as they are reserved for the spirits of the predeceased Joseon kings and queens.) TIP: instead of paying for each site individually (palace or shrine), buy a multi-pack which gives you access to many sites for a much lower price as is good for 3 months."
8,5.0,"Was very lucky to arrive in time for a free Mandrin Guided Tour provided by the Jongmyo Shrine. The very talented guide 李圣林小姐 have us a very educational tour throughout the shrine for about 90min. There were plenty of photo opportunities. Thanks to the morning snow as it provided a very different texture to the whole landscape. Do remember to bring wide angle lens or you will not be able  to cover the whole length of the shrines. The guide gave vivid description and explanations of the buildings, the historical stories, the people involved and significance of the shrine. We enjoyed the tour,the friendliness of the guide and cery beautiful scenes for nice photos. As there's only one toilet nearer to the exit. So do be prepared as the whole compound is pretty big. A full 2 hours may be adequate for the trip."
9,4.0,"Jongmyo Shrine is a nice place, easy to get there and the guided tour is around 60 minutes. It is interesting to know the history and culture of Korean ancients.We have been there in the winter, but we saw some pictures during the Spring and it shall be awesome."
10,4.0,"It is definitely something neat and historical to see in Seoul, but the downside is that you have to take a guided tour of it. I would have preferred to walk through at my own pace and see it. The tour was a bit too long for my liking."
11,4.0,"This shrine is having a wide area. There aren't many visitors. It's good to relax walking and watching trees and old heritages.It'll be more fun by learning how this place used and what each spots are.There are Gwangjang Market, Changdeokgung Place and Changgyeonggung Place locating closely. Connected tours to them are also nice."
12,5.0,You must take a tour to visit this place and their were only 2 english tours per day at the time we visited. Our guide spoke perfect english and was very informative about the resting place for the Emperors. The Gardens here were beautiful and not only were we told about the burial and mourning processes for the Koreans it also gave a very good insight in Confucianism. The guide was happy to answer any questions. The tour was a little fast (about 1 hour) and you did not have the opportunity to explore as you were kept together as a group however that was all part of being in a sacred place. This was by far one of the best attractions our family visited whilst in Seoul.
13,5.0,we had the guided tour in English and found it very interesting. It is an Unesco world heritage site but perhaps not easily accessible to everyone. I did not regret the visit to understand the korea soul.
14,4.0,"This place is located in the city like most of the attraction in Seoul.  I was surprised to find out that is not the typical Shrine like in other Asian country.  This is actually where the believed they needed to keep the souls of those pass rulers of South Korea.  Is a very simply Shrine but if you book a half a day tour for a couple of dollars, your tour guide will explain all about it and this really makes it worth the visit."
15,5.0,"1) Usually only guided tours are allowed. But on every Saturday and last Wednesday of every month you can visit this place without a guide.2) Admission fee is 1000 won. But I strongly recommend you to buy a Combination ticket for palaces and Royal Shrine. It includes 5 palaces, Secret garden of Changdeokgung Palace and this shrine. Costs 10000 won, but great economy for you if you are going to visit these places!3) This one of the places where you can feel how really old is it. In Korea it's not in every place so, because all palaces are reconstructions."
16,4.0,"This place is only available to visit on a guided tour as it is a sacred place for the royal ancestors. Plus it's a Unesco world site, so they do not want unguided tourists to damage the place. Only 1 day per week is available for unguided tours or during national holidays. So check your timings for guided tours before going!There's no need to make any reservations on their website. Anyway the link goes no where! I tried several times but doesn't work. The shrine is very near Jongno3ga train station on Line 1. Just exit 8 and walk straight, turn left and its there!Best to go on a guided tour as the guides are very knowledgeable and you can know good information about the area and history from them. As this place is a sacred area, please be respectful and no running or playing around. Also, the stone paths are for the spirits, so don't walk on them! It's very different from the palaces so it's an interesting visit. Recommended!"
17,2.0,"Jongmyo is a huge compound with 2 main halls housing spiritual tablets of deceased Kings and Queens. Unsurprisingly the buildings are subdued and solemn. We visited on a Saturday - the only day you can visit without a guided tour. Personally, I would not recommend a visit to Jongmyo if you are short of time. However it would be worth to visit to watch the royal ancestral rites known as the Jongmyo Jerye and the royal ancestral ritual music known as the Jongmyo Jeryeak.Do note the long straight stone pathways - they are meant for the spirits."
18,5.0,"It is one of the 7 Cultural heritage sites in S. Korea, and one of the 2 Cultural Heritage in Seoul. Also talking about ancestors' royal families shrine still leaving behind now only be found in 3 countries in the world, Vietnam, China and S.Korea. Surprisingly that, the volume of visitors were low in particular for Chinese visitors. Looking at the frequency of foreign language narrative service, you will find Japanese speaking rank most, and English speaking second, while Chinese speaking sessions, might have 3 times a day only. Disappointing! Admission fee is less than 1 USD, believe it or not. You will be taken care of by a professional escort speaking the language you chose, either Japanese, English or  Chinese (putonghua), leading you from entrance to every track, building, temple, shrine and stories. Stunning perfect! No individual visit allowed, and have to stay in the admission time slot per language narrative service, so, please check in online first, and be alert that, it close on Tuesday."
19,3.0,"This was another UNESCO World Heritage site which we were excited to see but it was a letdown.  These was just a compound with 3 major buildings, 2 of which were used to store the tablets of the kings, queens and other noblemen.  Since there was no tour on the day we visited, we really could not appreciate the shrine.  And the buildings were all close.  It would have been better if we could see a glimpse of a tablet or how it looks like, even just in an audio-visual presentation."
20,5.0,We took a Japanese guided tour(English tour is more frequent) and it took us for about hour and half? The guide lady was nice and we usually don't take guide tour in Korea but was very worth it. It is located only 5 to less than 10 mins taxi ride from Myongdong area. Looked pretty interesting and very local feeling to walk around the area.
21,5.0,"We went on a weekday. To note, in weekdays you do need to go in with a tour guide. After this experience, I would recommend doing it with a tour guide as opposed to going around yourself. The staff was very educated and very informative. We were given time for photo ops at each location. The shrine showed a rich Korean heritage and culture of respect, which I loved. I thought this would not be a to go to spot. But I'm glad we went. Con -  you have to stick to the tour guide to hear what they say. Tip - buy the palace package for all sites 10,000won instead of paying for each entrance fee separately. Max time spent there was 1 hr."
22,4.0,Jongmyo Shrine it was very interesting .Too old history .The place a bit not busy .but very nice ...
23,5.0,"Getting the free tour of the shrine (entry was 1000 won, though) from the Seoul-Mate University students was awesome.  There were six student tour guides for our group of four.  Each of the students had 3x5 index cards that had notes on the key points of the shrine.  Our group would never have appreciated the history of the shrine if not for the wonderful students of Seoul-Mate!"
24,5.0,"The shrine was easy to find from the subway station.  The admission fee was very inexpensive, and they have tours led by English speaking guides. If you are interested in Korean history and culture I highly recommend it."
25,3.0,We paid a small fee to take part in the English guided tour. This was quite an interesting place with beautiful scenery and architecture.The guide was very informative and knowledgeable. We were however allowed to walk and see certain areas only. The inside of the buildings were off limits to us.The tour took about 45 mins. Not too long (otherwise it would start getting boring & it was freezing cold outside) and not too short.
26,3.0,"On the day we went you had to wait for a tour. The next English one was over 1 hour and we were running out of time, so we joined one in a language we did not understand. Hence there was a lot of waiting around while she spoke.  It is very large as are the palaces. I would not put it on my list of must sees, but we bought a combination pass for the palaces which included the shrine. If you do it the way we did then you can always look it up online to explain it."
27,4.0,"confucian culture in during Chosun dynasty, occurred about 500 years ago and this Beautiful trying definitely represents the dynasty. It's tucked away from the city centre and the Sprawl and it's quiet and peaceful and its Beautiful with nice trees gorgeous flowers and it's still standing and looking really magnificent. Go! Highly recommended."
28,3.0,"It took me a while to look for this place in trip advisor as all our photo shown Chongmyo instead of Jongmyo.It is well maintained, peaceful park that show where the korea king stay in the pass.When we was there, there will be a kingdom ceremony held, we got lucky to see some of the rehearsal during the visit."
29,3.0,The shrine is ok for quick day-filler. Not the most exciting UNESCO site that I've ever visited but it includes a scenic walk through some ancient (supposedly enchanted) Korean heritage site. The tour guide spoke fluent English and answered all of our questions. Cost of the tour is very cheap. It's closed on a Tuesday
30,5.0,Perfect place to know the past of Korea. A place where Kings used to pray during different era. This Shrine will definitely satisfy your Korea trip. You couldn't miss this if you visit the five major palaces.Be sure to catch your language tour to understand more the background of this historic place.
31,4.0,"The History of this Shrine is to keep the tablets of the Royal Emperor/Empress and they will pray every year to the ancestors. It houses 13 tablets (if i rememeber correctly) which initial only have 2. Hence, the shrine was expanded as the dynasty continues for decades (many predecessors thereafter).There are many interesting things at the main shrine, where you will see the pillar shape is different on the right compared to the left as the latter was built at later stages.For those whom are interested to visit, please go on weekday and Sun as Saturday has no guided tour and it will be meaningless to go on your own unless you have visited it before.There are 4 languages for the tour; Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese."
32,4.0,"First of all, be aware that you can not just enter this shrine bcoz u have to take the guided tour. Also, it closes on tuesdays. Entrance is cheap if compared to other sites, only w1000 and children under 7 are free to come in. We came here and took the english guided tour at 10 am. The guide is a pretty korean girl but most of the time we couldnt understand her english. However, we got the part where she said the pathway which is on the center of the entrance is for the spirits to pass by and i was standing right on the pathway 😱😱😱😱. The shrine is the place to have ceremonies to call the spirits of the previous kings, but the actual burials are not here. Inside the buildings there are tablets that represents the kings and queens, but we didnt get to see them as they are all behind closed doors. The place is interesting with lots of trees n traditional buildings, nice to take pics though the guide was quick to escort around the complex."
33,3.0,"You can purchases a combi palace + shrine ticket if your travelling to most of the palace and this shrine.Please do take note of the various timing for your language each day before traveling to this place. You are only allowed to go in in a tour group, which also means that if you miss the timing, your not allowed to enter unless you want to follow a different language tour group (means you probably not going to understand anything)The tour consist of the main areas, but not the insides of certain places and structure. If you would like to tour the place by yourself, please go on saturday (IIRC)."
34,5.0,"Took us a while to find it because of all the maintenance work around but once we were inside, we were glad we did try to find it. Without the tour guide, we were able to enjoy the scenic view, with well-placed buildings dotted in a nice park. Entrance fee was cheap, so it was a good stop."
