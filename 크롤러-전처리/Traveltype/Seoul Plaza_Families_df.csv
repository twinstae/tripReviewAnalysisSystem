0,3.0,We went here in December to see the outdoor ice skating. The price is very cheap. Only 1000 won. The ice skating area is not too big. There are some food outlets near the skating area.

You'll probably find yourself in the vicinity anyway, touring Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Lotte Department Store (both highly recommended attractions), and the park is half way between them.So swing by and have your picture made next to the gigantic letters spelling out I SEOUL U, a completely touristy photo to add to your memories of South Korea. One afternoon, the letters were missing, but a crane restored them later in the day. So I think you'll find them when you visit. By night, a field of lights creates the illusion of a sea of flowers, also a great time to visit!"

3,3.0,"Seoul Plaza is a big open air place next to the Seoul City Hall. Attractiveness of this place really depends on that is currently planned and if there are any festivals going on. If there is none, then it is simple a big grass square...When we were there something was going on, but we came to late from Deoksugung Palace to participate and as we didn't have time to visit City Hall, we moved forward to other attractions."
4,5.0,Really enjoyed our stay at the Seoul Plaza. Very well mannered staff who are always ready to help us. I take my hat off for the staff for the respect they gave me and my family. Very well located. Walking distance to nearby markets and awesome restaurants. Nice facility.
