However, the exhibition which I visited was quite interesting for Tintin lovers!Exhibition entrance fee is quite high in my opinion. Products sold are even more expensive.Access by metro is not very difficult, after exit from metro, about 10-15 minutes walk."
1,5.0,"We attended an orchestra at the concert hall it’s amazing I tried so many times to book for the concert online before i arrive to seoul but it didn’t work so the minute I arrived to the hotel the hotel employee made the reservations for me and gave me a reservation number , we followed the directions listed on the site we went by subway from city hall station . I showed the reservation no for the ticket counter employee and she gave the tickets easly. We enjoyed the concert and when we finished we went to watch the music fountain its so beautiful."
2,4.0,"Enjoyed visiting the Giacometti Exhibit at Seoul Arts Center - at the Hangaram Design Museum. Nice exhibit showing details of Alberto Giacometti's life, education and evolution as an artist. Would have liked to have seen a bit more english descriptions since I don't speak/read Korean. But the exhibit was very nicely curated."
3,5.0,"This was our first time to the Seoul Art Center (SAC) and I must say the facility and performance were both excellent. The SAC is really a complex of different venues. We are at the main stage for an afternoon matinee. The wife and I have seen the Nutcracker at least five time over the past twenty or so years but I think this was the best show we have seen. The performance was very good, the transition between sets was excellent you never really notice the change. While a little pricey ranging from 100 to 50 dollars, we had $60 seats. This put us on the second level, just off to the right of center. We saw the whole stage. and I like being up a little.  The SAC is a very clean and well maintain facility. There are a couple of eateries but those are pricey you can cross the street and find a couple of great place to eat either pre or post viewing. Getting there is fairly straight forward, since we don't drive in Seoul we use the subway for all our intra-city transportation needs. Take the 3 line (Orange) get off at stop 341, from there the signs will direct you to the SAC. Its a 7- 10 min walk or there is a shuttle bus every ten minutes or so. Same pass will get you on any of your mass transit options here in Seoul. In closing great show, great facility and we are going back tonight for Handel messiah tonight."
4,4.0,Came for a concert. This concert hall was beautiful. Every seat had a good view and the acoustics were awesom. This is attached to the bus and train station and it has some shopping and dining opportunities. This venue is primarily for events and would not necessarily be a destination to visit if there were no event you were going to attend.
5,3.0,"I was there for the Frida and Diego exhibition , the show itself was amazing and well organised, but I had a hard time finding the place, English info are not very clear on their website and I ended up visiting 2 times not knowing that it will close on every last Monday of the month . I was surprise that such a big museum had no English translation in the show and was unable to connect to their wifi at all. In conclusion, this museum is not very ""foreigner-friendly""!"

7,5.0,Great performance and great staff. The hall has great acoustics and Orchestra is very talented. Take the subway line 3 and look for the shuttle bus service that is free.
8,5.0,"A little far out of city centre but huge place with multiple art museums of different interests and performance venues (eg. contemporary art, graphic arts, cartoon and illustration, music) so there is something for everyone. Although was very disappointed that none of the official (and unofficial) websites mentioned the closure of the Calligraphy Museum for renovations (till sometime in 2016) as that was the main purpose of my visit there. Nonetheless caught an excellent travelling/temp Mark Rothko exhibition so wasn't entirely wasted trip."
9,5.0,the best of Asian art to be observed  and sometimes to chat with a top artistA resting place when one needs one  from the hectic city life
10,5.0,"I have visited two art exhibitions, done one print making class and attended a performance by the Chamber Symphony Orchestra at the Seoul Arts Center and can't recommend it more highly!  The Rothko and Print exhibits were amazing, though nothing was in english and there was no english brochure we could use, but since the Rothko exhibit came from the National Gallery of Art their online tutorial about Rothko was amazingly helpful!  As part of the Print exhibit we paid to make our own prints which was very fun, the artist guiding us through the process spoke perfect english as he had lived in TN for a good while.  And the Chamber Symphony Orchestra concert on Mother's Day was a wonderful gift!  It was a little warm in the auditorium that day so make sure to wear layers. The sound was perfect and playing quite moving.  We also enjoyed the musical fountain show outdoors afterwards.  Since we live in Seoul we drove and parked in the convenient lots right there. It's better to pay inside for a quick exit!"
11,5.0,"This is a beautiful place where you can enjoy all the preformances and shows that real art can show . Also you have a water fountain that it dance with ligths and music , very nice show ."
12,3.0,"There was lots of good art from all types of people. It had classic pieces and more conventional pieces in it. I am not a great fan of art, so I did not enjoy it so much."
13,5.0,"Enjoyed the musical, had a great time and the actors were amazing. Only bad thing was that it was raining after the musical and getting a taxi was a difficult task."
14,4.0,"Its nice, and has a fine collection of goods. I was not disappointed,Yet, the exhibit is a bit small sometimes, but what do you expect from a ""free"" exhibit anyways?"
