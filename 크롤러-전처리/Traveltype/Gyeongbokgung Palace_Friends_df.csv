0,4.0,The palace is one of the most iconic heritage site in korea. Usually quite crowded but you can surely find some corner to take your perfect photo of the magnificent architecture and charming landscape. There are a lot of people in the traditional korean hanbok and it's a great place to take a stroll to immerse yourself in the korean culture.
1,4.0,The place is full of historical story and well maintenance. There are a lot of photo shooting area take you can spend a day of. You can also rent the traditional cholth here but better don't do it on winter season. Here also provide free tour guild but due to covid 19 this service is cancelled.
2,5.0,You must get a ticket to get in the palace. Its totally worth to visit. Try to spend 1 to 2 hours here to discover this beautiful palace.
3,4.0,"We rented those traditional Korean clothes, Hanbok, and took many picturesque photos. Worth doing. There is a cafe in the palace and so you can relax there in between taking photos."
4,5.0,"In my opinion this is the best palace in Seoul. I would reccomend renting a hanbok from across the road if you can since they are beautiful, and entry to the palace is free if you are wearing one. The changing of the guard ceremony is cool to watch. The vibe of this palace is very touristy with many girls taking pictures in their dresses however this is a must if you want to take breathtaking pictures of Seoul. This was one of the highlights of my trip!"
5,4.0,Super awesome place! I really love everything from here . Would like to go back again here! Super worth it
6,5.0,A true historical treasure in the heart of downtown Seoul. This amazing palace  draws you back to the rich history of Seoul and Korea. Easily accessible through public transportation. Close to many other cultural attractions.
7,4.0,"It is a good place to visit during your free time but not to a great place to explore. I have lots of more beautiful places like that when I was in Mongolia, so it wasn’t really woow."
8,5.0,Expansive palace with regular change of the guards at the entrance. This traditional palace right in the centre of the city is amazing. Tourists and locals alike rent the traditional Korean costumes when roaming around takes you to an atmosphere of several centuries in the past. A traditional village nearby is also a must to visit. Unfortunately my visit was cut short by heavy rain on the day. Need to go back again in summer when it should be very enjoyable.
9,5.0,"As really beautiful palace but full of tourists wearing Hanbok in the afternoons. For a quiet time, arrive early (e.g. when it opens). There's a museum towards the left of the Gwanghwamun gate and it's free admission. King Sejong and Admiral Yi bronze statues are a must visit too."
10,5.0,Easy to locate the rental hanbok stall and short 3 mins walk to the palace. Saw the guard changing ceremony. Guards look so cool and good looking! Ha!
11,5.0,"If you're visiting Seoul just for a day, do not miss Gyeongbukgung Palace. Also wearing a hanbok allows you free entrance on most attractions in Seoul."
12,3.0,Not much to see in buildings. There are free english guidances but the english speaking is not very undertandable.
13,3.0,"It’s alright. Not much to see. There isn’t a lot of activities, it’s mostly just different areas of the palace"
14,4.0,"The entire area is huge! We kinda in rush on our trip as we want to see the guard changing order which was scheduled at 10am and we have book a tour at another palace at 1130am so we didnt have much time to explore the area.When we were there, it was raining the night before and the water turns ice in the morning!"
15,5.0,"Majestic place, November is the best time to visit of you want to experience cold weather. Cable car and hiking to experience best shot at the top of the mountain."
16,4.0,"Wonderfully restored historical jewel, in a fashion reminiscent of chinese and Japanese palaces - here you can see the life of ancient rulers of Korea."
17,5.0,"I visited gyeonbokgung evening tour with my friends wearing hanbok.. we were able to tour the palace and see it in daylight and night time.. it was so beautiful! We were lucky as there was a traditional korean music performance on the palace grounds as well, so we got to experience that😊"
18,5.0,I loved the old place with change of leaves.  Taking leisurely couple hours of walk with a friend on a weekend was a perfect way to relax & catch up.
19,4.0,"If you're interested in history & culture, visiting the palace is a must.  So many places to see from the King & Queen's quarters, throne room, banquet hall, etc. Try to catch the changing of the guards which has a great ceremony, brings you back in time with their costumes, music & performance. At certain times, there are free guide tours in english"
20,4.0,"The palace is packed with tourists. We instead went to the farthest area north of the front gate where it was too far for tourists to go to. The view of the mountain was stunning. You can also imagine yourself walking as a resident of the palace hundreds of years ago. Oriental magpies and Brown-eared bulbuls make the palace come alive, not to mention the autumn foliage blazing in the background. You're going to have a great experience of the attraction where there are less people, in my opinion."
21,4.0,"Went here as our first sightseeing excursion Seoul. Great cultural experience as they were performing a reenactment of a ceremony. The grounds are huge and you could easily spend a half day exploring the property.  They give free tours in several different languages at different times, which is well worth it. Our guide was knowledgeable and super friendly, and eager to answer any questions our group had. The palace is easily accessible from the subway with a short walk from the nearest station."
22,5.0,"Amazing palaceIt's very old palace and amazing pleaseYou can see every thing from pastYou can spend more 4 , 5 hours"
23,5.0,We ended up renting hanbok (Korean old-style fancy clothing) before going into the palace which meant that we got free entry. The palace grounds are stunning with lots of good places for taking photos especially if you are wearing hanbok. There is a beautiful pond on the right side of the grounds if you enter through the main gate. You can also see a large mountain looming over the palace grounds. Unfortunately we couldn’t see the whole grounds because we had to leave after two hours to return the hanboks. There is also the Korean folk museum and modern art museum nearby though we didn’t have a chance to go. You can’t walk into the buildings but other than that the palace is definitely worth going to.
24,5.0,"Palace is well-preserved and has splendid carvings and paintings. The place is compact and gets pretty crowded, even on weekdays."
25,5.0,Surprising and a magnificent view at the lake in the winter. I usually come to this palace in the spring and fall time. But this time I had some friends visiting from overseas so I embraced the cold to show them the palace. Not a hint of disappointment. Pretty cold to wear Hanbok but the picture well worth it.
26,5.0,"If you're coming to Seoul, this place is a must see. The grounds are huge so be prepared to do a lot of walking. The view of the mountains is very majestic. You can rent a hanbok in nearby shops so you can enter for free which i highly recommend if you really want that Korean feel during your tour and take nice pictures in centuries old architecture."
27,5.0,"After a while the palaces start to look alike, but they each are beautiful in their own way. Best viewed in the winter or after a storm because the skies are usually cleared of smog and yellow dust. Take your time while walking around, take ur all in."
28,5.0,"Wow. Visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace was the highlight on this one day tour. We felt as if we were transported back in time, by just walking through the Palace gate. It felt surreal for me. Seeing the size of the property and the designs certainly added to the mystique of the surroundings. The changing of the guards reminds me of British Palace tours, only more colorful and artsy. Added to the attraction were the visitors of all ages wearing rented traditional garbs. Amazingly awesome place to visit. We spent an hour here including visit to the National Folk museum situated on the same grounds. A must see when you go."
29,5.0,"Free English and Korean tours available,  usually 1.5 hour long. Three times a day,  last is at 330pm or so. This was on a Sunday for us.   I recommend the tour guides bc it makes seeing the building and at different aspects more enjoyable and knowing their history is a plus.Admission is 3000 won/ adult.  Credit card accepted.  You can rent traditional clothing and get free admission,  rental rates is cheaper as you get further from the palace.  Usually 10000 won nearby the palace. Folk museum is right next door and free admission."
30,5.0,This place is a must visit to all visitors! You must rent Hanbok and take picture in the palace. Great view and great picture.
31,5.0,"Amazing place to visit. We did this as part eof our Seoul full day tour, so our guide explained alot. We arrived right as the changing of the guard ceremony was beginning. Plenty to see and learn."
32,5.0,This historical place gives wonderful Korean experience. Lot of people wear Korean dress ( that gives free entry) and walk around. Many of photo sports. One can take free guided tours on specific times. A must see place if you visit Seoul.
33,4.0,"Unfortunately we forgot to visit at the back side of the palace. 😭😭Wear hanbok for free entrance. Hanbok rental is from 12,00/hour18,00/4hourThe shop just across the road from side gate of gyeongbukgung.There are many hanbok rental shop around there."
34,5.0,It's really interesting for visit the palace of the country we visit. This palace is the main one with beautiful views.
35,5.0,"It is the biggest palace as I know in Seoul. It is better to enjoy during the spring or fall, but it has it’s own beauty every season.So don’t hesitate to visit this palace! :)"
36,5.0,This palace is the largest of all five palaces famous in Seoul. The beauty is mesmerizing. There is a small restaurant also that serves basic food along with some souvenirs. It will take around two hours to visit the place. The entry is not free here so ready to pay an amount that you won't regret later. A must visit place.
37,5.0,"This was the very first place we wanted to visit when coming to Seoul. We took the opportunity to rent traditional hanboks in one of the numerous shops longing the palace, so the entrance was free (if you don't rent one, then you must pay the entrance ticket). A walk in the palace took us a good two hours, it is even bigger than we thought when looking at it from outside. It feels quite magical when you're interested in Korean culture, even more when lots of visitors are wearing hanboks themselves. There are a lot of spots to take pictures, sometimes you might meet Korean people asking to take a picture with you!You cannot go inside the palace though, you can check what's inside from the windows. But it was overall a really good visit and we felt really involved thanks to the outfits. I recommend renting a hanbok to visit, it doesn't feel the same than when you wear your own clothes!"
38,3.0,It was very pretty but the vibe I got was very touristy so I could not really enjoy it. There wasn't much more than eggshell buildings you could take pictures in.
39,5.0,A beautiful palace to visit -  not as busy in the morning so I recommend going as early as you can when there are no ticket queues. We got there by about 10:30-10:45am and left by 12 and it was heaving - long queues. Lovely to see people walking around dressed in traditional outfits that they had rented. The areas surrounded by water are the most beautiful to see.
40,5.0,"I love history and it was amazing to visit the grand and amazing Gyeongbokgung Palace. Experience the changing of the guard ceremonies at the main entrance Gwanghwamun, the museums, ornamental gardens and some of Seoul's grandest architectural sights. Rent a Hanbook and besides getting free admission into the grounds with it, look good in your pics with the traditional Korean costume. Lots of culture and beauty in store here, like Gyotaejeon Hall and Amisan Garden, Gyeonghoeru Pavilion, Hyangwonjeong Pavilion,  Sinmumun Gate, etc. Wear comfortable shoes for walking ....."
41,4.0,"Beautiful gardens. Tour guides are very helpful and speak perfect English.  It would have been a little easier to not wander in circles if the buildings and roads were better labeled. The grounds itself are really big, so make sure to wear walking shoes! If it's not too hot, go hire the hanbok costumes and experience the palace the way Korean royals would have in the Joseon era."
42,5.0,An Amazing Palace. You must see the guard change ans the Big garden. If you want all things to see you need a lot of time
43,5.0,"Best place ever, it’s truly amazing. Some parts of it was under construcrion. Be aware that for the pavilon, you have to book tickets a day before. The entrance fee is unrealisticaly cheap. The avarage time what tourists spend there, is 3-3,5hour"
44,5.0,"Thoroughly enjoyed walking through this palace and grounds. Opted to get dressed up in hanboks with my Korean friend and we were allowed free entry to the palace, which felt like a nice touch for tourists already spending money renting hanboks. The colours inside the buildings are mesmerising and my friend told us they were part of the decor to ward off evil energy or spirits, as well as the mythical creatures and sculptures at the end of the roofs. Very beautiful. Be sure to catch the guard changing ceremony as well, narrated via speakerphone in Korean, English, Japanese and Chinese."
45,5.0,"this wasnt busy when we went,. Noon on a weekday. The palace is largr than life. So beautiful and people are dressed in their authentic korean wear (free entry if you have th dress code). But we paid some 3000 KRW to enter. spent about and 1 hr taking some pictures. amazing experience"
46,5.0,"This is a very beautiful palace, easy to stroll around, with many people dressed in traditional clothes adding to the charm of our photos. The changing of the guard is very simply done but with great honor and punctuality. Sadly, the tourists are all over the place and hardly notice this important tradition, but I am very pleased to have witnessed it. My only wish is that each building have a sign, in English (and other languages) to describe it's purpose. That would be a very useful addition."
47,4.0,"We went in for free because we were wearing hanbok. The palaces were well preserved. We did not find the main palace though, maybe because of the ongoing constructions. And the hanbok was a bit hot so we just left after we took some pictures. I am definitely going back there on colder days."
48,5.0,"The views are amazing !! Good exposure to local tradition and heritage.You must wear a HANBOK! go for the theme hanbok which you can get for approx 30$You get free entrance to the palace of you do so, but it makes you feel like your in a movie or in a princess movie"
49,4.0,Find guard changing period and go. Huge place so be prepared to walk.A lot of shops nearby for food.
50,5.0,Place to learn korean royal familyOutdoor activity bring umbrellaGood to see people wearing hanbok3000 won for admission
51,5.0,My friend and I enjoyed our visit here. I would definitely recommend joining one of the free tours. We caught the end of the free English tour and it was helpful for understanding what we were seeing.
52,5.0,When you visit this palace make sure to be there in the morning to see the change of the guards at 10.00 - then take enoug htime to explore all the different bulidings it has to offer. Crowded place but worth it.
53,5.0,A must go if you are a history addict! The museum offers free english guided tours at selected timings and the guide is very informative and lovely! Try to go before 9 am to get the tickets and roam around before the first english guided tour at 1030 to avoid the scorching hot sun later in the day during summer. The palace gets rather crowded and becomes difficult to take a good photo without other tourists in it. The palace is very well maintained and many areas worth exploring after the tour. One of the perks of wearing the Hanbok to the palace is that you get free entrance into all the palaces. Do note that this palace is close on Tuesdays.
54,5.0,"Feel very humble inside this place, but it’s crowded and sometime hard to move or take pictures at the same time"
55,5.0,"We really liked that the Palace provided free guided tours in English which helped us learn and understand the different structures within the complex, and the life of the Korean royals back in the day. This is especially interesting to those who watch K-Dramas."
56,5.0,"One of the key cultural attractions of Korea in my opinion! There are many shops around the palace that rent traditional clothing especially to go to the palace, so that's what I did (foreigners are wlecomed to do so!). I loved walking around the castle and taking pictures. There are many tourists inside the main court but of you venture into the gardens behind the castle it gets less crowded."
57,5.0,"We had a beautiful and enjoyable experience here. Rented a hanbok from nearby and took photos and videos in this Unesco heritage site. It was a really nice day. Come with a full stomach as food is not allowed inside. Or have snacks outside by the exit before or after. We enjoyed the dumpling shop and CU store, in our hanbok :-) Well kept and beautiful Palace.  Staff in Secret Garden was kind and helped us on our way, especially when we were last in the group. Thank you for the English conversation and encouraging words to us as we walked up and down and climbed the steps."
58,3.0,"Saw many local and tourists wearing the traditional costumes and indeed they brightened up the whole place, which was just ancient buildings.  And it is amazing to see how the building was built with small caving like holes for firewood so that the whole building could be kept warm during winter time."
59,5.0,"this is a huge space with beautifully reconstructed gates, temples, and recreation areas. If one rents a native costume and wears it into the grounds, admission is free. Many tourists do this and it adds a flair to the grounds and they all seem to be enjoying their moment in native dress. It is a fairly large site and one can spend a great deal of time there or one can see the highlights in about an hour plus and move on. I highly recommend visiting."
60,2.0,Nice taking photographs but long walk from station. Many people wearing the Hanbok. Good for children to understand their culture.
61,5.0,"I’ve watch many period dramas, I’ve read quite a few books on Korean History and always enjoyed documentaries in regards to the history of Joseon Dynasty. But to walk through it, to sit within the palace walls and have tea with dessert really made my knowledge come together."
62,5.0,"This place is huge and it's a maze inside. But it's fun to walk around and especially the pavillion on the water looks great. It was really crowded, though."
63,5.0,"This palace is one of the best ""parks"" to walk on a spring daytime. Good architecture and nature combined."
64,4.0,The gate itself is impressive and the grounds are well with the entrance fee. The most interesting quirk were the dozens of girls who bring along traditional outfits to photograph each other with their friends and take selfies. Even the tourists get into it and there’s a costume hire place conveniently located near by. Had a lot of fun here simply people watching.
65,3.0,"A visit to Seoul should include this sight of the palace. Easily accessible by train. Cost per adult is 3,000Won unless you hire the hanbok. Takes about 30mins to see most of the main halls. Not wheelchair friendly though if one is thinking of getting in with it. Uneven rock slab surface."
66,5.0,This palace has many buildings and extensive grounds. If you rent a traditional Hanbok costume (shops at exit 2 of the subway) entrance is then free. You can wander on your own or take a guided tour. We chose to go it alone and had a great time.
67,5.0,"We took an easy walk and got several nice photos. I think we spent there for almost 3 hours. As we went there in the morning (11), we managed to avoid the crowd what came afternoon."
68,4.0,A must visit attraction when in Seoul this attraction is busy with visitors everyday. One has to queue to buy tickets and this can be uncomfortably cold in March and April. Do note that seniors get free entrance - do show your passport to get your complimentary tickets into the palace ground. The foot ways are uneven and one must be sure footed to prevent any tripping. One can see many people in rented period Korean costumes around the palace ground. Do rent one if you fancy taking photos with the palace in the background (but then there may be many people in the background too).
69,5.0,"Very large area... must wear a comfort shoes... the palace has a ceremony every 9 o clock. If you want to wear hanbook costume, just go outside..you will find many places rent it, worth 4900 won(2 hours) If you want to set your hair in korean style, you must pay 5000 krw. If not..just wear a nice bando..free."
70,5.0,"for first time visitors,try renting hanbok and explore the whole place while taking pictures.its hard to beat the crowd but there are parts of the palace that are less crowded..it took us maybe 2 hours to explore this wonderful palace while taking hundreds of pictures."
71,1.0,"If you're a foreigner, you go into a foreigner-only queue where you pay a full-rate entry price to view the palace. If you are Korean, you go into a Korean-only line where you pay a special, discounted rate. This is typical of a foreigner vs. Korean mentality you find in many places in Korea, but it was surprising to experience this as a foreigner at such a big tourist destination."
72,5.0,Only 3000 Won entry. £2 or $2.50 US. Very reasonable for entry to such a beautiful place. Changing of the gaurd takes place outside the charged section so it's completely free. The 10am one is less busy. Perfectly timed to then take the 11am English tour around the palace. We absolutely loved it. Informative and friendly lady who guided us around in perfect English with subtle humour also. Highly recommend
73,5.0,"When we went in December, it was getting cold but we chose to not wear jackets over our hanboks. It was the best decision! We took some stunning pictures and because it was colder, it wasn't too packed. I loved it!!"
74,4.0,Was good experience to walk around the palace in hanbok and admire the cherry blossom and scenery. Have an enjoyable morning walking around with many photo taking places
75,5.0,When you stay in South Korea or you planning to travel you need to visit there. One of the history palaces...
76,5.0,This day a lot of tourists love to wear Hanbok dress ( the Korean traditional dress) if you wear Hanbok no entrance fee to enter the palace. If you go there in the Autumn you will see some color change very pretty. One day out of the month is free to enter (Every last Wednesday of the month don't forget to bring your passport) Even citizen less than 24-year-old and people who are 65 years old and up are fee enter. Don't for get to check National folk museum of Korea.
77,4.0,"Actually my 3rd visit .  But this time , there is the norm to wear their traditional attire , and the entrance to the palace would be free. If you want the more good quality hanbok it is either you rent or just buy. In doing so , the government was able to highlight their culture . Many would love doing their photo ops for social media motives. Place is huge , so just causally move around . By the way , at the start of the tour is the changing of the guard . But being late in the rental leaves you with the least desired among the traditional clothes."
78,5.0,"With a group of people who rent hanbok, we entered this palace and it's free if you wear hanbok (Korean Traditional Dress). This is the 2nd time I have visited here. The palace is so big, and we didn't get to walk around much area. It's unique that you wear hanbok and take photos in here, seems like you are really living here. You have to experience it at least once."
79,4.0,"I enjoyed exploring the palace with the English guided tour. Since we were in hanbok, we got to enter the palace for free and it became much more meaningful as we learn more of the history. There were many photo opportunities and it was nice to catch the changing of guards demonstration."
80,5.0,"We visited Gyeongbokgung early in the morning in rented hanboks therefore received free entry. You needn’t feel self-conscious as nearly every other person was dressed in traditonal dress wandering and taking photos. The palace is the most beautiful one we visited and we were able to appreciate the beauty early in the morning when there was less crowds.  You needn’t have a tour as you can wander the location yourself even there there were not a lot of explanation signs. Be warned, as British tourists dressed in hanboks we were asked by many Asians for photos, so be prepared for pushy people and smile.One of Seoul’s top attractions!"
81,4.0,It was great to watch the changing of the guards ceremony & to wear the Hanbok traditional dress for the occasion. Lovely photos with the beautiful palace buildings & environment. Worth the visit.
82,5.0,"Beautiful palace full of cultural touches. It was amazing to see tourists and visitors dressed up in traditional clothing while walking around the sites. However, some part of the park was under construction when we went. Would definitely recommend seeing  and dressing up too (as long as we remain respectful towards the culture)"
83,5.0,Used Color of Korea for our tour. Can't say enough how pleased we were treated. Ms Ju and her driver Oliver were very professional and it would not have been the same without them.
84,5.0,"Okay so! When we haven’t really considered the fact that the day when we went to Gyeongbokgung Palace was on a Holiday! The place was pack with people. You can’t take picture without people busy passing by . On the entrance area people flocked from local tourist to foreigners to students who’s having their educational tour.Most of the palace were closed, the one near it was closed that time. The palace is so big that you can just find  spots for you to explore. However, popular spots are expected to be crowded. Just see my photo! ONCE AGAIN! Don’t go there on a holiday. Photo edit by my friend Trinity Uy. Thanks for the cool picture ❤️"
85,4.0,A interesting venue but best explored with a guide as more information about the many buildings can be explained in detail. The plaques erected all through the palace are also written in English which is great if you are not local. I was there for the changing of the guard which happens twice a day and it was the highlight.
86,5.0,We watched the changing of the royal guards and it was very fascinating. The costumes are outstanding! We had our pictures taken with the guards too while they stood at attention. It's worth a visit if you're in Seoul!
87,5.0,You may spare a day to explore the whole location. Best spot is small lake (pond) inside the center area
88,3.0,"We walked the entire park. Beautiful buildings. No one there to talk about any of them. Cannot see inside at all. A few doors open to look at empty spaces with painted walls but most areas doors locked and cannot see inside. No furniture, no mats.  Do not get a feel for how they lived many years ago.  There is construction going on in some area which were completely blocked off. I was disappointed because I wanted a sense of how the family lived their lives during that time period. Only saw buildings."
89,5.0,"One of the five palaces in Seoul and is the largest one. Highly recommended: wear a hanbok, korea's traditional costume, while exploring the palace. Highlights: changing of the guards ceremony."
90,3.0,"This palace has been rebuilt after it was destroyed. We had a volunteer high school student do the tour with us, she did a really good job. Unless you really care for the history and don’t have better things to do then it is good to visit. The metro line gets you there so you don’t have to worry about directions. We had to wait for around 15 minutes for tickets. But, overall, it was an ok thing to do."
91,5.0,Beautiful old charm surrounding with modern buildings in Seoul city. Gyeongbokgung Palace is very big area. Hanbok rental shops is located near to this palace.
92,5.0,The first palace built in the Joseon dynasty with over 500 years history. The impressive royal culture and palace life can be experienced.
93,5.0,Lovely part of palace. Nice place. Picturisque.  We enjoyed our photos in this area. We drop by nearby  souvenier shop.
94,5.0,"Is a history attraction in Korea. Was aware of his ethnic culture and being in his old days. Is an old palace that still maintains it’s original condition quite well. Take Beautiful pictures. If there is a chance,should go."
95,5.0,"It didn't look as big from the outside as it really was. For only 3000 Won which is about $3US, it is very cheap and you can also go to the Korean Folk Museum for free which was also very interesting. You learn a lot about the Joseon dynasty."
96,5.0,This palace shouldn’t be missed even on the shortest trips to SK. They offer free English tours several times a day or you can explore on your own. Architecturally the palace is stunning and it’s neat to see people dressed up in traditional Korean attire around the palace. Your admission also covers free admission to the folklore museum. I would recommend visiting both.
97,5.0,Once your are in Seoul is a must to go and visit the Gyeongbokgung Palace.This Palace is the biggest one in Seoul.Also there is a museum next to the palace.
98,4.0,We spent a couple of hours visiting this palace where you can go from courtyard to courtyard to see various buildings. The queen’s quarter is interesting as well as the heating system they used in those days. There is a small cafeteria and souvenir shop within the palace area.
99,5.0,"This is when it hit me that I had finally made it to South Korea. The architecture was stunning, but my favorite part was the changing of the guards- the outfits, the armor, what an experience. You can't come to SK and not see the changing of the guards!"
100,3.0,"tried on the hanbok at a nearby rental shop and got complimentary entry passes to the Palace. It was very crowded and people were taking photos everywhere. The facilities were minimum and there seemed to be only one cafe for visitors to have a quite bite or hot drink.in my opinion, if you are interested to just take photos of yourself in a hanbok this place is an ideal choice. if you are into history and culture, i don't think it would be good ."
101,4.0,"I didn't find it so impressive, but it's a matter of taste. A lot to walk, it's a big area. I wish more informations in english."
102,5.0,So easy to get to this place and very near to the subway. This place is just beside the National Palace Museum of Korea. You also can rent a hanbok and experience walk around the palace with a traditional hanbok of Korea
103,4.0,"I went with my friends and so many people were wearing beautiful Korean traditional clothes. I heard there's a place that you can rent them. Anyway, I kind of wished that they have more signs or at least have QR codes or something to explain what the building was."
104,5.0,"number one tip is to hire a Hanbok and get in for free. Loads of places to hire one, it cost around $13 for 2 hours. I hired one for 4 hours and had a ball. Being and older blondie, I copped a few stares and compliments, but had super fun. It is really a series of buildings that you wander around. Pretty wheelchair accessible, there are ramps over entrances etc. I highly recommend the museum that is attached. It is well set out and very interesting. I went with a Korean lad, but would have been fine to wander about solo. There is not a lot happening in the palace itself, more a wander through the building and complex. Still  highly recommend this location."
105,5.0,"The entrance ticket was really cheap, maybe 3k₩ , and if you wear hanbok it’s free. Which is a nice experience, especially when the weather is warm. There are many hanbok rental places around Gyeongbokgung. Going there be prepared for some walking, it’s a very spacious place. Also, there’s a folk museum inside. It’s very near other places worth visiting, such as Insadong, the Blue House and other palaces."
106,4.0,"Definitely worth a visit if you are in Seoul. If you want a full experience, I would go rent a hanbok (the traditional Korean dress) at a nearby store before going into the palace. If you do rent a hanbok then admission is free! They have bag storage at the rental places so your outfit won't be ruined by a backpack or something. If you go during the winter, use base layers to keep warm."
107,5.0,"We felt like princesses during this time when we visited Gyeongbokgung Palace despite the cold weather we manage to stay, smile and mesmerized of the beauty of the palace and its surroundings."
108,4.0,We saw the ceremonial changing of the guards. Very colorful and well organized.  Would have liked to see more of the inside of the palace.
109,5.0,"So I'd say what's a palace without its crew?  When we visited GBK Palace, we rented out hanbok from a nearby store so we can truly feel what's it like to live like a Korean in the past. Although it's kind of uncomfortable, it's nice to experience it while we're there.  The costume for men starts at 17k KRW for 2 hours. If you opt to add a headdress, that would be an additonal 5k KRW. For girls it's a little but more expensive, but hey, girls dress more than we do. Hahaha"
110,3.0,"That place a bit disappointing me. Most of buildings are basically replica and quite new. Off coutce there is reason why so, but still. Area is big and it is nice place to escape busy city. But at end of a day, it is just another Palace made for tourist attractions."
111,4.0,This is nice palace but no remarkable because their architecture is boring. But Korean advertise their culture is very good with free ticket if wear hanbok. I appreciate it
112,4.0,"I have been to Korea 5x now and I'm never ceased to be amazed by all the museums and historical sites! Anyway, this was my first time here and the site is quite large with expansive grounds, displays, and monuments to explore. You could easily spend a few hours here. If you're a fan of historical Kdramas, this would be a place to visit! Just to note, I was here during Korean New Year's (2/3 through 2/5?) and there was no changing of the guard ceremony. Also, aside from Myeongdong, many of the malls and underground shops were closed or partially open."
113,5.0,It is not an abundance of things to do or see but it is really cheap and kind of cozy to stroll around in the gardens amongst the temples. And sitting in front of the mountains it is a pretty scenic.
114,4.0,If you are into lots of walking and in big groups will be nice. There are performances and was crowded but nice to see travellers in HanBoks. Good location to shoot documentaries and vlogs.
115,4.0,Saw the changing of the guard on a minus 13-Celsius day but that didn't spoil the spectacle. The National Museum of Korea is right next door too and the subway stops right at the palace.
116,4.0,"It was a cold day and the trees were all bare (as expected in winter) but the grandeur of the palace and the grounds around it was still impressive. Even better was the changing of the guards. If you’re going to the palace, make sure you get to see this."
117,3.0,"The palace and the palace ground were impressive, just as we see them on TV.  Well preserved, clean and well loved."
118,5.0,"This was a great place to visit. At $3 for entrance fee with a free (and excellent) English tour, this is a must for all visitors to Seoul. Do take note of closing days (I think Tuesday). You can also combine the entrance fee to the other palaces for a bargain but I felt that I didn’t need to see the others after this one."
119,5.0,Really enjoyed visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace. Covers a massive area so be prepared to walk and dress warm during winter . If you time it right you can watch the ceremonial changing of the guards(about 20 minutes). Also head to the back area so you can see the Blue House where the President resides. The property is kept very clean and organized. Was amazed to see the traditional dresses or “ Hanbok “worn by the female visitors. Bathrooms were spotless clean and nice. Great stop to see while in Seoul
120,4.0,"But maybe better in another season, like spring or fall. Went in December a few years ago, and the landscaping was pretty bare because of the frigid temperatures (Korea gets cold in winter), and I imagine it must be pretty spectacular in either spring or fall.Enjoyed walking around the grounds, and there are plenty of great places for photos even in the winter. Wish I would have gotten tour guide or one of those personal tour things, but was in a rush and did what I could in the limited time we were there. Would be a great place for a picnic (not sure if that's allowed though).Would definitely go back if it wasn't December."
121,4.0,"Definitely worth while to visit, staff very friendly to answer any question. Unfortunately lot of the pavilions are closed, so not much tonsee, other palace is better for this, bit nice grounds to walk around.Changing of the guards is not authentic and very touristic unfortunately."
122,5.0,"I’ve been living in Korea for almost 5 years now, and I still visit the palace on a regular basis. Mainly when visitors come as a major site for them to see, but it never ceases to amaze me. It’s stunning and takes a good long while to walk around and take in the beauty, and for only 3,000₩ it’s a great deal for something to do on a low budget."
123,5.0,"A beautiful Temple, well kept and offering a good half day's experience. Multiple photo opportunities."
124,5.0,"Korea has maintained a single nation state for 5,000 years. It is a country that has never been invaded by other countries while suffering invasions of foreign powers."
125,4.0,We visited the palace just in time for the changing of guards ceremony which was interesting. The architecture of the gates and the palace was a nice change
126,4.0,"Not really a review of the place but for those who wants to wear/try hanbok, the Korean traditional dress. Just to let you know that they are available from 5,000KRW. If you ever found one, which costs around 20,000KRW — RUN. Because you will regret it. My friends and I rented one for 20,000KRW. We were dressed with the more ‘normal’ ones as opposed to the commonly rented ones which looked soooo good. The place is good for photoshoot while wearing the hanbok."
127,4.0,This is an amazing palace complex well worth a visit and try and include the changing of the guard.  It’s large so lots of walking but flat terrain so comfortable and then a short walk to the presidential blue house.
128,5.0,"Seriously one of the most beautiful palaces i've ever been to.It's a MUST!And do not go if you are on a rush, you will need time."
129,5.0,Very highly recommend.Amazing tour. Make sure you attend the guard switching ceremony.Better visitor with a guide to learn about the history.
130,3.0,"As important as this palace is in the list of national treasures of South Korea, it's actually quite a boring place to visit full of empty buildings, except for the throne room and the changing of the palace guards. Wish they had filled those buildings with some kind of exhibits to reflect the glory of this palace. I had to get a sense of the magnificence of the palace during its glory days in the National Palace Museum instead."
131,4.0,I love watching korean drama joseon era... do i love it. Its simple .... nothing special if u don't appreciate history. My friend and i rend an hanbok from the near rental shop which cost us 15000 won per person and we enjoyed taking nice pic with it.
132,5.0,This is one of the major palaces in Seoul with a beautiful pond in the middle of the palace that is one of my favourite photo spots in town whenever I have visitors to the city.
133,4.0,This palace is the historical place. We can learn real history and ancient culture  of Korea. I would like to recommend to visit this palace at least once who want to understand the Korean history.
134,4.0,The palace was 10 minutes walk from the Four Seasons and we could see it from the hotel itself. We were fortunate enough to catch the first snow of the season overnight so awoke to a blanket of 2-3 inches of settled snow. The walk to the palace took longer due to the conditions and the visit to the palace made a little more magical by the white out effect. Ordinarily there isn’t too much to see but we dawdled to admire the scene even though it was cold. Felt a little sorry for the guards in costume - hopefully they were suitably dressed underneath.
135,4.0,Just outside the front gate is Gwanghwamun Square and the statue of King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sun-Shin. The palace itself is a nice visit. Try to see the changing of the guards if you can. This palace is one of five found in Seoul. Definitely worth a visit.
136,4.0,"Be there by 10.00 am to watch the changing of the royal guard ceremony; then take a leisurely stroll around the palace grounds and visit the various pavillions and palace buildings. You can cover the palace in about 2.5 hours. Entrance fee is KRW3,000."
137,4.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is quite a huge place, with museums inside that describes about the history of ancient Korea. The entry to the palace is free when you wear their tradtional clothes, ""hanbok"". Do remember to check the days the palace is closed before going!"
138,4.0,If you are into history of ancient and modern Korea. You can pay a visit.You need to pay to get into the main palace. But the museum itself is free. Inside you can learn about the history of Korea.
139,5.0,This palace seems to go on and on and continues to amaze. The grounds are incredible and the self guided tours (headset and map) are helpful and informative. One really fun thing is that if you dress in traditional Korean clothes entry is free.
140,5.0,Excellent historical place to visit. Interesting architecture. There are many hanbok rental shops nearby the palace...a lovely sight seeing tourists all wearing hanboks...view is like straight from the movie set of an ancient korean drama.
141,5.0,Make sure you visit when the Imperial Guard ceremony is taking place and don't forget to wear your hired Hanbok for the full Kore-xperience.
142,5.0,"If it’s your first time in Seoul, this is a must see. The palace is huge, you will need to allot 1 to 2 hours or more if you fancy taking pictures while wearing hanbok. The place can get very crowded. Check the schedule of changing of guards and be there to watch it."
143,4.0,This is a good place and needs to be in your itinary if you want to see culture or relates to art. It could be crowded so need choose your time very carefully.
144,5.0,Amazing! Went by fall when the colors are so vivid. Not that many other tourists also. Really recommended
145,5.0,"Wounderful autumn view in the palace. Stunning view must visit place in Seoul. We take a lot of beautiful pictures wearing hanbok. However, the palace is super crowded so is advisable to visit in the morning."
146,5.0,"This place is a must visit. Really beautiful and serene, great atmosphere, excellent views, touch of history."
147,5.0,"This a beautiful place. Immediately, the beauty of nature well treated by centuries captures you. The trees, changing leaves in this so beautiful autumn in Seoul, the ancient architecture, the wonderful traditions — all makes up your day— a place to visit."
148,5.0,"I went to Gyeongbokgung Palace last year with my friends. The transportation to get there is not complicated. I took the subway( Line 3 orange one) and got off at Gyeongbokgung Palace station. I was really excited to try Hanbok on which is Korean traditional clothes. There are many shops where visitors can lend Hanbok. My friends and I also wore Hanbok. We walked around inside of Gyeongbokgung Palace, and the time was really good because it was super peaceful.If you like peaceful place, I recommend you enjoy Gyeongbokgung Palace with Hanbok."
149,5.0,Been here for almost 4x in my Korea trip. But it always amaze me everytime I go here. It really gives us the ambience of a palace in the city. :)
150,5.0,"It's like visiting a K-drama historical era.  If you have a tour package, it might not included the hanbok rental and your tour guide might only go to areas that are more popular for picture taking. If you have time, explore the whole place visit the small alleys that are less crowded and quiet."
151,4.0,Do yourself and other tourists a favor and rent a hanbok from one of the nearby rental places across the road before going in. You save the price of admission (which admittedly isn't high) and have a whole lot more fun.
152,4.0,It was a good glimpse of their tradition and culture. The place is very clean and just the right spot for a tourist spot.
153,4.0,"I would recommend going early. By 11am the place was very crowded. There are 3 free English speaking tours and we attended the 1.30 tour. It was very informative. The buildings are interesting and we learnt a lot of its history. However the highlight was the peaceful garden, by the water and with the mountains in the background. We sat here for at least an hour after the tour, away from the bustle of seoul outside the walls."
154,5.0,"This is my second time coming to the palace. I spent more time in the palace this time round and even wore a hanbok. Most parts of the palace looks the same but if you are short of time, just see the main entrance area and the big front part of the palace and finish of by visiting the garden. y.I didnt spend alot of time this palace when I came the first trip because I had other sites to explore. Good for picturesque shots and instagram worth. Try to come early if you want less people."
155,4.0,"This is one of the main attractions of any visit to Seoul.  We walked right around the exterior walls in the early morning before it opened for a bit of exercise.  The buildings on the inside are large but nor elaborate - grand but understated.  The thing that interested me most was how they heated these large buildings in winter by having fires burning in alcoves in strategic places in the stone foundations to provide underfloor heating.  Without that, they would have been freezing in winter."
156,4.0,it's really fun to experiece with hanbok at this palace. i just a little crowded during the month i visited. maybe it's autumn now! overall great and enjoyed at here. love it.
157,4.0,Went specifically for the night lights. There was a special music performance at night but didn’t manage to stay for it. Go if you want to take amazing photos
158,5.0,This is a beautiful place to wander around and imagine what it was like in the past. The changing of the guards was an interesting ceremony.
159,5.0,"I was fortunate on my visit here to see a lot of students dressed in traditional Korean costumes which made the atmosphere more enchanting, even though it was drizzling during my visit. Close the the Folk Museum also which was great!"
160,5.0,"It was my second time visiting this palace and it was still a wonder to the eyes. It is very large and touring around it will take more than an hour. This is one of the more famous filming sites in Korea. If you are lucky, there are also ceremonies which you will get to see live for free. Entrance fee is 3000 won and it is worth it (at least for me); clean and very well maintained. If you’re into architectures and culture, this place is highly recommended."
161,3.0,You can see a bunch of palaces and interesting places. The major gripe I had was the amount of information in English was limited. I would love to see more in depth historical descriptions and other things to make looking at the architecture worth it. Worth the trip if you are in the area but not terribly exciting
162,5.0,"As an avid fan of main attractions when travelling, I find Gyeongbokgung a great experience because it is value for money and it is immersive. You get to walk around the palace almost unrestricted and the place is well maintained. Great for photos and a half day session. Be sure to catch the changing of guard ceremony that happens at midday.Check out one of the traditional costume rentals around the vicinity of the palace and rent them around 15000-20000 won for two hours.It's great because you don't have to pay for palace entry when you're in costume!"
163,4.0,Great location lots of people in traditional costume. Unfortunately it was raining and it is an open air kind of deal but still worth it
164,5.0,Korea has preserved this place of over 600+ years and it still looks spot on. The place is scenic and incredible. It is very rich in history and there's a free English tour.
165,5.0,This beautifully restored and maintained property is lovely to see. It's very scenic with many folks wandering the grounds in traditional costumes. I would have loved to spend more time here!
166,5.0,You should visit all the palace. all are special in there own way. Gyeongbokgung is ofcourse the bigest and the one you shoud do for sure when you are in Korea
167,5.0,This is a must see. The architecture is beautiful and it’s an oasis in the city. Take some time and walk the grounds as well.
168,4.0,"Arrived just in time for the changing of the guards! We took a cab to the palace, so I’m not too sure about parking."
169,4.0,Good start to touring Seoul & Korea. Limited English signage.  Great place to see people wear hanboks. (Free admission to palaces if wearing.)
170,4.0,"We spent a couple of hours walking around a looking at all the buildings and then went to a museum at the end, which is included in the admission fee. You are able to rent traditional costumes for photo taking. We didn’t do this, but we did see a lot of people wearing the transitional clothes."
171,5.0,"I visited the Palace grounds twice as the first time I did not get a chance to see it all. The second time with a friend, we rented traditional Korean outfits and explored. Was such a neat experience and excellent for photographs. The palace and the grounds are beautifully kept and so much history."
172,5.0,"visiting the final night opening in this year 2018. lots of people are there. so fantastic and beatiful palace. Keep remins that when you want to visit here, should buy ticket in advance through Internet. 정말 멋지고 꼭 한번은 봐야할곳. 올해의 야간개장은 끝났고 내년을 기약하며..일반개장도 야간못지않게 또 다른 느낌이니 꼭 한번 아니 두번 가보시길.입장권 예매는 필수."
173,4.0,"If you want to experience history in modern Seoul, you have to go here. Korean history comes alive while you wander the extensive grounds. My tip is to come here during the Chuseok Holidays"
174,4.0,"Love it love it love it ... picture perfect, truely enjoyed. Its like going back in time, visiting the golden era."
175,4.0,"This is good place to learn about the Korean culture and history. It is in the heart of Seoul and is an expansive place to walk around so wear good walking shoes. The buildings are preserved well, and the grounds are well-maintained. It is nice to see some of the people dressed up in the traditional costume so you feel like you were there in the old days."
176,4.0,"One of palace you should visit when you came to seoul. i visited the palace wearing their traditional Korean costume,they called it ""Hanbok"". their place very nice especialy on spring season. their entrance fee is free if you go inside the palace wearing hanbok."
177,4.0,"The palace, I must say, is quite huge that weren’t able to visit the whole place. So many picture-worthy spots everywhere especially if you’re a fan of KDrama."
178,3.0,"Don’t visit it in summer because really hot, it’s open palace but u can’t go in just see it from outside, entrance fee cost 3$ , their are 2 show changing guard 1 out palace 2 in palace"
179,5.0,"Although the current palace is not the original one, we still enjoy the ancient atmosphere, the magnificent structure. Highly recommend to make a visit in the autumn, when all the ginkgo trees turn to magic yellow and all the palace sinks in a very romantic atmosphere. You also can hire a Hanbok, dress up, walk in the palace and let your imagination go through back the ancient time!"
180,4.0,"I will wrote down my bad experience here, we went here without expecting the place would be that huge, we wore hanbok ( since you'll get free admission) and took pictures inside the area , half an hour later we left, we didn't explore the whole area ) and I just realized that I lost my phone, I ran  back to find it but it's gone, I asked the securities and almost no one speaks english ! I found it's very irritating becuase it's one of the first tourist destination and nobody speaks english! the lady in the security guard told me to go back to the first gate which I already went to and they couldn't help me, and they didn't do anything to check if someone found my phone, at the end somebody told me that her nephew found my phone and HAND IT TO THE LOST AND FOUND COUNTER! it irritated me most because that means they didn't even checked the lost and found counter ( that is hiding behind the dessert counter ) . The attarction itself is nice, spare your time becuase it's huge, if you rent hanbok make it at least 2,5 hours so you can wear them around the cultural village as well. But if you need help , embrace yourself since nobody speaks english to help you."
181,5.0,"i habe several times visit and each time have recognized different point. do not expect alot, so simple and quite, no luxry but let you to feel strenght"
182,5.0,"Built in 1395, the Gyeongbokgung Palace is  arguably the most cherished of South Korea’s many heritage sites. It is similar to Beijing’s Forbidden City, but at a slightly smaller scale. However, do not let this scale comparison confuse you, this palace and its grounds are quite expansive and should rightfully take at least half a day to visit properly. The complex has been extensively and lovingly restored following destruction by and expulsion of the Japanese during WWII. It is currently a museum (Korea’s imperial family is long gone), the grounds of which also contain the National Folk Museum. This is a must-see while visiting the South Korean capital."
183,5.0,"This was such an amazing trip, anyone who is going to seoul must visit the palace and village, it takes a few hours to walk around the palaces but so worth the walk, make sure to find the information guide and get a map off them because you'll definately need it."
184,5.0,"This palace is definitely a step into the past in Seoul. The palace is really big though, you'll probably need at least 3 hours to explore, or even 5 hours! It's really big but it is so beautiful. You can learn about the history of the palace while admiring the beauty of it!"
185,4.0,"Cannot say that I was absolutely astonished by the palace, but it is a tourist must visit in Seoul.To make experience more fun, make sure you rent traditional Korean costumes and wear them around. There are plenty of places nearby + you get free entry to the palace!"
186,5.0,"I was visiting Gyeongbokgung to make the K-Drama scene I watch every single week comes true. The palace is so traditional and ethnical, and we could take pictures with traditional Hanbok (but remember that the Hanbok should be rented outside Gyeongbokgung Palace area)."
187,5.0,"If you like history you should visit gyeongbokgung palace, you can see royal guard performances and learn about korean history. You should allocate sufficient time to enjoy the palace."
188,5.0,This historical palace is one of the most popular attractons in Seoul. Royal guard performances occur several times a day during opening hours and are worth watching. There is also a large pond within the inner palace grounds. Overall the palace is beautiful but crowded with tourists.
189,5.0,"Should be on your bucket list when in Seoul, large premise so do allocate sufficient time to slowly enjoy what the place have to offer. Tend to get crowded during public holidays"
190,4.0,"This was actually the first major attraction I visited upon moving to Korea almost five years ago. I have been several times since; most recently in the spring of 2018. It is of great historical significance and also never seems to end. However, it is also overrun with tourists. Especially on weekends."
191,5.0,If you are in Korea you must visit Gyeongbokgung Palace for sure. The guard change attraction is very amusing as well as Korean girls wearing hanbok. You will get the feel of Joseon era in every corner of the Palace
192,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung is a must-see for anyone who is traveling to Korea for its history and traditional culture. The palace grounds are wide and you can see various traditional buildings with traditional art that are perfect for artists and architect enthusiasts. Surrounding the palace are hanbok rental stores where you can rent beautiful hanboks for about 2 hours for about 10,000 won. Considering that a basic hanbok is a few hundred thousand won, it's a great deal for those who just want to wear it for a day. It also gets you free entry into the palace (normal admission is 3,000 won for adults)."
193,5.0,Interesting area just in the centre. For tourist free entrance with the national costume. You can rent your costumes nearby the palace.
194,5.0,Loved the palace! It played a fundamental part in the history of Seoul and South Korea. Beautiful place with over 7000 rooms. The place is extremely walking friendly and traditional with such neat architecture
195,5.0,"We were able to experience the changing of the guard, which was definitely worth seeing.  Also sought refuge from a deluge of rain in the coffee shop, which was convenient!  LOLSite is easy to navigate on your own, but may be more interesting with a (private) tour guide."
196,4.0,"If you want to do one touristy thing in Seoul, this is it. The big park surrounds the different part of the palace buildings which are nicely decorated.You need 1-2hours or more if you want. Nice to hang around in the park or you might visit the National Folk Museum Check the times for the changing of the guard, worth waiting for."
197,4.0,This is my 4th visit to Seoul.  Gyeongbokgong still a Must go place for 1st timer. Brought my friend there n she loves it at 1st sight.
198,4.0,"The palace is about 2-3 blocks walk from the Anguk Train Station. Entrance is free is you're wearing a hanbok. We rented the dress for 18,000KWN. Prices depends on the design and you could get it for as low as 10,000KWN to around 25KWN. It was raining when we visited but they still allowed us to rent the hanbok. Make sure to hike up your skirt while walking to avoid getting the dress soiled (I ended up soiling it still though). If you want to see the exchanges of palace guards ceremony, make sure to be there around 9AM. The open area is good for taking photos with the palace as the background. A nice place for people who loves architecture, otherwise, there's ""nothing much"" for you to see as palaces would ""look the same"" in one way or another."
199,5.0,its beautiful i recommend taking a tour as some of the signs are not in english  so it is hard for non korean speakers to know the history of certain builsdinbgs
200,3.0,"Palace is very vast and grand.  but wrong timing for us as the weather was extremely hot.The changing of guard, while colourful, is not very pompous.  should include more soldiers and perhaps horses, etc."
201,4.0,I recommend you visiting this with a hanbok rental. Most people go here for photos and this place never disappoints.
202,5.0,It gives you a sense of traveling back in time. Gyeongbokgung palace is a great place to visit with your family and friends. You can even try on their traditional Hanbok ( traditional Korean outfit ) if you want to feel and look authentic. Took a tour around the whole palace and the view was utterly breathtaking. One of the best palace I've ever been too. 9/10
203,5.0,"If you like about the culture of Korea, you should go here for enjoying the culture of it. In this place also a time for the changing of the guard of the palace, a museum about the Korean culture, and the building are still in a very good condition. If you use Hanbok (Korean traditional clothes) you don't have to pay for the entrance fee which is 3,000 won or around 2.7 USD"
204,5.0,"You are not ""visiting"" korea if haven't visit this palace! very unique and beautiful buildings! You even can rent hanbok, a korean traditional cloths and going around this huge palaces!"
205,5.0,"We learned a lot of the history of Korea when we visited the palace. Despite the place being packed and the rain, we had a great time. This is definitely one of the must see places in Seoul."
206,5.0,"Plan a whole morning to visit this palace. Its bigger than i imagined. Start by watching the Guard Exchange. Buy the Combo ticket, that includes 5 total Palaces/Temples around Seoul."
207,5.0,It's a nice place for a historic site visit. I was with my friends and they gave me a real good and well rounded tour along with a nice dinner place recommendation right next to the palace.
208,5.0,"This is where your visit through Seoul must start: the Great Palace!Spectacular, magnificent, a reminder of the culture once Koreans shared with Chinese. Located among New Seoul, this Palace reminds u of the dynasties in this place. You can perfectly picture the outside fortress or wall, the inside chambers for the people close to the emperor, the emperor’s palace, the opulence of his room, the gardens, exits, streets and hallways. Take as many pics as you can, every little space is awesome!Get there by metro, the Station has the same name as the palace, within walking distance you can also find downtown and many local restaurants."
209,5.0,Well worth a visit. Think of the Forbidden City in Beijing. The Palace is just as amazing to see. It’s a large place with lovely grounds to walk and enjoy and impressive buildings.
210,5.0,"It is really worth od seeing. If your love old asian architecture, you will love this old palace. They have free english guide every 2 hours I think. So you will have better experience from this place."
211,5.0,"I had a two hour visit to the Gyeongbok palace with a tour guide miss Sue Chung, a government certified English tour guide. The palace is gigantic in location with many chambers such as working and residential.  The Gyeongbokgung Palace, which once had more than 7,000 rooms. The palace was restored in 1867. The palace is truly worth it. By the way, you will surely need to take a bottle of water, sunglasses and a hat with you. We rented traditional Korean attire for photos and roaming around the palace. The shopkeeper was the one who selected our attire with bright colors. SEE photos."
212,5.0,"Beautiful site, huge area. We spent over 6 hours there and could have spent another 6 looking around. The changing of the guard takes place at 10:00 am and 2:00 pm - definitely worth seeing. The grounds are gorgeous, peaceful.You forget about the bustling city outside the gates and lose yourself in centuries of history. The buildings are intriguing, the detail impressive. The mountains surrounding the palace are a majestic backdrop for the views and photos.The museum included in the price of entry spans two floors with an excellent collection of artifacts and glimpses of what life would have been like over the centuries. We only had an hour at the museum which was okay for a quick look. Next time I'll allow minimum 2 - 3 hours. Well worth seeing!"
213,4.0,This palace is on a large piece of property with lovely old architecture and statues with the mountains behind on one side and the city on the other.  Try to go at 10am or 2pm when they do the changing of the guard at the entry gates.
214,5.0,Would have wanted to experience during the different seasons but being there in summer was already breathtaking.
215,4.0,It’s pretty relaxed not much to do but actually see the palace so it’s great for learning about the culture pretty sure there are some guided tours I actually just got a ticket and explored was fun and a little confusing there is a museum on site but they were closed when I was there all in all it’s a good place to get a walk about in and see and feel a little history at the same time also some really good photo spots for scrapbookers
216,5.0,A great place to go learn about Korean traditon and stuffs. Good operation for a touristic site.....
217,4.0,"I went here by korean metro, if you go here on weekend, there is a bunch of students who offer a free tour for the palace, the students explanation is a lot better since they are better in english that the tour guide inside. Make sure you wear a warm clothes if you visit in winter, the wind here was pretty strong."
218,5.0,"Place is beautiful. Large. And only cost 3 or 4 dollars for entry and free if you wear traditional Hanbok clothing which can be purchased outside the temple for a few from between $15-$50 dollars for 2 hrs depending on the store and how detailed you want yourself to look (i.e make up, accessories, clothing choice from standard to premium etc) You can go with a tour guide who will fill you in on who stayed where and what each building was or you can go on your own as we did and discover the place yourself. definitely recommend it."
219,4.0,"I was so shocked to find such immaculately preserved ancient history in the middle of such a bustling city! Loved seeing the other visitors in their transitional dress for the tours. The picturesque mountain in the background, ponds, trees, and temples are exactly what you’re looking for in a great photo-op."
220,3.0,"Like other places in Mainland China, this Palace dont have many things to see. All buildings were similar with chinese deco and tipical. almost half of the palace filled with sand field. No ete catching gardens that make our visit impressed. Only visitors with traditional hanbok dress could attract your eyes."
221,5.0,Rented the traditional Korean dresses (hanbok) with a Korean friend at a shop close the palace. We took a lot of photos at the palace and had a lot of fun. Highly recommend it if you want to feel like a princess and travel back in time. I would recommend good and comfortable footwear as the palace is quite big and it took us a couple of hours (plus photo time) to finish.
222,4.0,I decided to visit with my friend.  Entrance is very inexpensive and you get to see a huge palace.  I must have walked over 7miles.  From hotel to palace and backagain.There is a little cool feature that you could enjoy.  In the middle street there is a huge statue of one of the smarter kings.  You will see a little hut so check it out.  The lend some period costumes for free and a spot where you can take a nice picture.
223,5.0,"Time travel is true to this well preserved palace. Despite being in the middle of busy CBD, the times goes back a couple of century when you're inside the gates. To complete your experience, Hanbok rentals are available outside the palace for KRW 5,000-KRW10,000. And yes, the KRW5,000 ones are good set but the shops are located at quite a distance from the palace entrance. ^,^.  English speaking tour guides are also available for free. Their stories will make you appreciate the palace more. Just check their schedules near the entrance. If you're a morning person, you can check for changing guards ceremony ^,^. It's really a must see!"
224,4.0,"I recommend this place for hanbok picture taking. There are a lot of people dressed in traditional Korean clothes which adds to the feel of the whole experience. We stayed here for almost two hours, just taking pictures."
225,5.0,This is a Wonderful experience that everyone should see when visiting Seoul. Many locals were dressed up in traditional Korean attire. The walk thru this place is very fascinating. The architecture is really a true work of art. The museum in the grounds was also a very memorable place to see.
226,4.0,"We went to visit the palace just before sunset and it was really stunning to see the palace in the evening light and later on with the lights on. We were extremely lucky to hear and see performances of traditional singing and music that evening. Wonderful palace, really worth a visit when you are in Seoul."
227,5.0,"One of the biggest palaces in central Seoul and I'm impressed by how well-kept the place is. It feels like you can step back in time and feel what it was like a few hundred years ago. Something you might not know is that you can rent a hanbok (Korean traditional dress) from the nearby areas and enter the palace(s) for free. I got mine from Hanboknam but there are a ton all around the palace. Might as well get it and feel like a part of the era. Little things like the changing of guard ceremony also help in helping visitors appreciated what it was like in the past.I would have appreciated if there were picture signage to help me identify where I was within the palace. That said it would have broke into the whole authenticity of the space. Overall it's a beautiful timepiece symbolic of an older Korea. Worth 1-2 hours of just visiting and wandering around, more if you're wearing a hanbok and taking pictures."
228,5.0,"the view is simply stunning. i went there in nov and there r red leaves. amazing. if u r lucky enough, visit the secret garden as well. we cant get the tix though as they r sold out - we wanted the guided tour, and that needs online registration which has quota. i guess the pics i took simply couldnt capture the beauty. go there yourself to find it out"
229,4.0,"Good place. Must visit. Know about a lot of history, the rulers etc. It shows about their dynasty, about the king etc."
230,4.0,Lovely palace with lots of history to learn about. Try and catch the traditional Korean music concert that happens near the cafe/gift shop cause it was really good!
231,3.0,"An old palace that is right in the centre of the city that attracts lots of tourists and locals daily. Along the way to the palace, we spotted a lot of shops that rent out Hanboks to tourists and many tourists were in Hanboks walking towards the palace. My friend and I did not bother to rent as we find it a hassle to walk back to the shop to return. But we realised a reason for wearing a Hanbok to the palace as you get to enter for free! You can see almost the palace were filled with visitors wearing Hanboks. Only a handful (my friend and I) were in our plain clothes. It is a big palace with a museum built inside the palace. We had a good stroll looking around at the beautiful structure and many areas are still constructing/refurnishing. A good place to stroll and relax. We saw a lot of elderly walking around, sitting under the trees etc to enjoy the day. But there isn't much to be fascinated as I prefer nature scenery to buildings. But if you like buildings, you may want to spend a whole day walking around."
232,5.0,"It's must visit place if you are in Seoul. The Palace is beautiful, buildings are impressive.  Better to take a guided tour to learn about history and culture. Every hour you can see changing guards ceremony. If you rent a Hanbok in nearby shop, you can take very authentic pics."
233,5.0,"With 3,000 won,its really worth it!so many beautiful spot to take picture.also u will learn a lot when u go to the museum inside the palace.recommend it!"
234,4.0,"My girlfriends and I visited the palace dressed in Hanbok, the traditional Korean dress, on a Sunday morning. The Hanbok rental place (3355 Hanbok rental) is conveniently located approx. 5 minutes walk away from the palace. The first thing we noticed when we arrived was the huge crowd outside of the visitors' entrance. The reason for this soon became clear- the changing of the guards' ceremony was taking place. This is when the palace guards (all dressed in their traditional guard attires) would 'change shifts' and it is a must see as the ceremony is quite elaborate and goes on for about 30 minutes or so.The next thing we noticed is the crowd in general. If you wear a Hanbok to visit the palace, entry will be free (please do confirm for yourself there as this might change). Thus, there were a lot of people, both foreign and local, dressed up in the Hanbok visiting the palace. And it was of course, a weekend. I'd advise you plan your visit for sometime during the week if possible.Insofar as the palace itself is concerned, it is well-preserved and definitely worth visiting as it is a piece of Korean history- both in terms of culture and architecture."
235,3.0,This palace is to be visited when in Seoul and the best part of the day was seeing the people.  When I went there was a festival of Korean Culture where people dressed up in traditional clothing and wandered the site.  To be honest I’ve visited too many of these temples of late but it is impressive and if you can go at night (which I did not - I saw a friends pictures) it is more impressive. There are stores nearby that rent the traditional clothing so if you are interested you too can look like you fit in.
236,5.0,"If you visit korea, this palace is a must to visit. This place is amazing and this palve is a site of korean saeguk drama shooting place.Dont forget to watch change guardian ceremony and wear ur hanbok so you could enter this place free (with no hanbok u must pay 3000won)"
237,3.0,"One of the biggest palace in Seoul that we were recommended to visit. However after heading over, we realised there was not much to see. However, it proves as a good spot for photo-taking if in Hanbok as it matches the theme. Luckily for us, it wasn't overly crowded and photo-taking was a breeze. However depending on the locations of the hanbok rental shop, the journey to the palace may take up to 30min!"
238,5.0,"One of the best places in Seoul. Rent a hanbok (traditional costume) and walk in the palace. There is a view to the river, and a park there. Enjoy also the guard change."
239,5.0,"Is amazing in korea. Make me like korean girl, hanbok and the kingdom of republic korea. I love this vacation"
240,5.0,Excellent place to walk around; as well as; noting all of the beautiful costumes worn by many.  I would visit again but at a different time because of the amount of people there.  A huge palace with a lot of area to cover.
241,5.0,A great spot to take a pics or vlogging! Although i was here when it was winter (its suuuuper cold) but i really like the palace :( i havent explore this place much bcs of the bad weather. But this palace is so great ok recommended
242,4.0,Very nice place to walk around and enjoy the old Korea. Hanging out here is a must and you may even wan to wear traditional dresses.
243,5.0,Amazing historic landmark. A must-see. Join one of the tours given by student volunteers. Really great to see the pride and knowledge the youth have for their history. Very friendly and welcoming staff. Be sure to visit the gift shop for unique palace replica mementos and refreshing teas in the cafe within the shop.
244,4.0,Changdeokgung palace is called the palace of illustrious virtue. It is a unique Korean palace built in harmony with the landscape. While we were there we were lucky enough to see the people dressed in national costumes a great photo opportunity.
245,5.0,Very peaceful and our favorite Palace of South Korea. You can rent a traditional dress (Renting places are very close to this Palace and we rented it 15.000 Won for 2 hours)
246,4.0,"This palace inherits centuries of history way back from 15th. It was destroyed and rebuilt somewhere in 19th century.Fully built with wood, the main meeting hall is an amazing architecture. Can spend a half day in here, including the neighbouring muzeum."
247,5.0,Do make sure that you dress up in hanbok (you can hire them nearby) and walk around the grounds of the palace. Make sure you are there for the changing of the guards because it is an amazing sight. It is a truly beautiful palace and a big part of the history of South Korea.
248,5.0,"While mechanical problems in Seattle caused us to miss our connection to India, the 24 hour delay awaiting our next connection opportunity gave us an awesome chance to see some of Korea.  The first stop on our free layover tour provided by Incheon Airport was Gyeongbokgung Palace.  Steeped in history, and quite well preserved, the Palace grounds we found were quite large, and filled with palace structures and artifacts.   The interiors of the palace were quite well preserved, awash in colored interior spaces, and the palace was teaming in costumed Korean soldiers of around  16th century Korea.  The changing of the guard ceremony happens in the afternoon, and it's quite a flamboyant spectacle with many costumed participants. The ceremony lasts around a half an hour, and is well worth a pic or two.  To add to the historical flavor, many locals come in costume to the Palace, and parade around the grounds.  I had heard many weddings also take place at the Palace, however, that was just traveler talk, nothing from anyone official.Self guiding audio tours with earbuds are available in many languages at the entry, and there seemed to be an ample supply.  As far as entry costing goes, I have no idea, as it was included in our airport layover tour.We found it worth the effort, and would recommend it to anyone exploring Seoul."
249,5.0,"It was built in 1395, it continued to serve as the main palace of the Joseon dynasty until the premises were destroyed by fire during the Imjin War and abandoned for two centuries"
250,4.0,"The place was huge, get your hanbok and you can get inside for free, you could tour all the palaces, it's just the distances between them takes a long walk. One hour is not enough to tour this place."
251,3.0,"I think is the best historic place in Seoul, but there are better shrines in other Asian countries.  If you are not a history gig and don't understand much about these places  , so it would like all others shrines. Only thing makes it little different is the size. Is really big."
252,5.0,"Seoul has about 5 palaces to see but gyeongbokgung is the most interesting for me. It is situated in an area surrounded by a Mountain View with nearby places like museums, restaurants and the bukchon hanok village. Experience the changing of the guards at 11am and 2pm."
253,5.0,Near the palace there are hanbok rent places. You can rent there and take photos at Gyeongbokgung. The palace is look like the one in the dramas so you can pretend to be the protagonist of saeguk dramas for a moment
254,5.0,"Great place, if you're wearing a hanbuk (Korean traditional dress) your entrance is totally FREE.. Explore the Korean world, ild Korean Style"
255,4.0,"do go early to watch the guards changing shift ceremony which start at 10am.  The whole ceremony last about 20mins, you can take photo with the guard thereafter but remember don’t touch them 🤣"
256,4.0,a great place to visit. would recommend planning your visit ahead of time as the palace is not open every day (closed on Tuesdays i thInk). There are set times for changing of the guards so again check out the times if you want to see this
257,3.0,This was the first palace I went to and I'm not sure if I find it that amazing... Probably if I have more time to go around and explore the entire compound. There were many tourists around that was probably why I did not enjoy it that much. It's great for experience purposes if you want to get exposed to Korean culture. There are a lot of things to do outside as well so you need not worry where to eat and stuff. It's also near other famous palaces and Insadong.
258,5.0,"The largest and oldest palace in Seoul, which is one in five of the palaces.This place combines historical stories,beautiful architecture and nature. I love here. Recommend to visit."
259,4.0,"When visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace, you must wear the traditional korean clothes ( don't pay the entrance fee ) It gives the tour a special feeling of the past times."
260,3.0,"This was a very nice visit, I went for the tour which had a lot of rich information about the culture, architecture and so on. If you wear a hanbok (typical Korean outfit) you can get in for free, they rent them in many places near the palace. I didn't try the hanbok option but I found it as a really cute option especially if you are into taking pictures."
261,5.0,"The Palace is huge with lots of buildings to see. We were treated to the changing of the guard which had local people dressed in period costumes. The changing of the guard was quite colorful and according to our guide was authentic. One could take a lot of pictures of the changing of the guard in addition to the interior and exterior of the various buildings that were on the palace grounds. On the palace ground is also the National Palace Museum of Korea which housed a good collection of the emperor's personal belongings, the cars, clothes, and items used in the daily living. Between the Palace and the Museum, plan to spend about 4 hours plus to see everything. There is also a small snack stand where one can get a cold drink and sit for some time to rest up."
262,5.0,Do this activity on a day you are feeling energetic because this place is huge! Avoid on the weekends because there are many protesters in the nearby area on Sat/Sun. Wear a Hanbok to get some stunning photos! There are tons of local shops nearby!
263,5.0,The grounds were very beautiful and peaceful. There are lots of places to take pictures. You must really time your visit around the changing of the guards ceremony. In addition go to the neighboring shops where you can rent traditional outfits for the hour or time duration of your choice. It really adds a special feel when you are wearing the traditional clothing and visiting the palace grounds.
264,3.0,"Near the entrance to the left, there is a small house offering free guard costumes for tourists and guests. They have schedules posted on what time they open so better take note of the time. The catch is you can only wear it and get to take a picture just nearby the house, you cannot go far and roam around. So when you have the chance, take all the pictures you can get with your group of friends and do all the poses you can make."
265,4.0,"Out of four palaces, Gyeongbukgong is the main palace. What I love about this place, it was easy to find when you exit Gwanghwamun Station. It was so big and can be seen far away. The changing guard ceremony will be held at 10 am on the front lawn."
266,5.0,"This was our first place to visit after our breakfast at the hotel.It was winter that time but the sun is out .The place was huge and while we were walking,our guide was telling us the story of the Palace.I recommend to visit this place first hour during your visit in seoul because you can no longer take the pictures you like if there are many people already."
267,5.0,Visiting this palace makes you feel you're in a Korean historical drama while wearing Hanbok which is free entrance when you wear it. The place is very big and many spot for instagram photos. One of the best is the lake view.
268,5.0,We had fun inside the palace. We rented Korean costume and had lots of fun photos. The best one in the one in the lake. It was postcard quality photos. Highly recommend to come and visit this place when you are in Korea.
269,4.0,"I have been to Gyeongbokgung Palace for more than 5 times and all are different season.  Those most I like is during Autumn. The lake is so beautiful.  Many people visited this palace dressing Hanbok, its make the place looks like very historical.  I love the architecture of the palace.  Its so classic and beautiful.  The information about the palace is very clear. The ambience is so nice and relaxing."
270,5.0,"One of the must visit places in Seoul. It's a big palace complex where you can not only enjoy traditional architecture but sometimes also performances, such as guard changing ceremony. I've visited this place many times and I definitely recommend to go there dressed in Hanbok. Not only you can enter for free but also the whole experience gets better!"
271,4.0,"Time this for the changing of the guard. Well worth it for the photo ops. The palace is definitely worthwhile and they are working to get ramps everywhere. So if you are a little disabled it’s ok.The national costume rental, allows the wearer to enter for free.Hint; remember to get a guide book at another counter."
272,5.0,The whole area around this is simply astonishing. Good thing - we got a perfect day with blue sky. Lots of people borrowed local costumes which gave the place a lot of flair.
273,4.0,"Very wide palace, wore hanbok when we entered and we availed a free entrance. Be early to get a nice photos"
274,4.0,"For first timers to Seoul, this palace is good to put on the itinerary.  Rent a hanbok at the numerous rental places and get free entry into this historical venue where kings and queens reined.Catch the changing of guard ceremony while you are there."
275,5.0,"Located in the center of the city, its beauty will attract everyone. I went there in the afternoon and it was great. We can feel the ancient times and we will be amazed with the structure and paintings in their details!You can get free ticket also if you go there in hanbok (Korean traditional clothes)!"
276,4.0,"A palace to remember,you can see,experience and learn something new about history.. if you're a history lover especially to those cultures of different countries,then hooray and come.. for sure you'll love this place.. if you're wearing a hanbuk (cultural dress) then your entrance fee is 100%free,(no need to buy ticket for the entrance )"
277,4.0,"This is my 2nd visit to the palace , Gyeongbokgung palace was the biggest , 1st visit was with tour guide and he will explain section by section of the palaces , my 2nd visit was on our own , we didn't go inside the palace this time , instead strolling around outside the palace which was beautiful too and it's free . Admiring ladies wearing beautiful Hanbok . If you wear Hanbok korea traditional clothes admission is free for men & ladies ."
278,5.0,"Even if you spend only a few minutes here, Gyeongbokgung Palace is a beautiful and important part of Korean history. The main palace is a stunning example of Korean architecture and it is a great place to sightsee with all the visitors in traditional Korean dress."
279,5.0,"My friend and I rushed to Gyeongbokgung Palace to witness the Changing of Guard Ceremony, we were awed with performance despite of the cold weather. Afterwards, we rushed to the nearby store to rent a hanbok-traditional Korean dress. It was a bit expensive but it was worth it. If you visit this place wearing a hanbok, entrance fee is waived. The palace is a beauty to behold. This is the biggest palace among the 5 palaces of Seoul, South Korea. This is the living witness of the history of Korea. The palace offers breathtaking views, perfect for pictorial. If you are a heritage lover, then this place is a must see. Aside from the palace itself, you can witness the changing of guard ceremony observed every morning and visit the National Palace Museum and National Folk Museum within the compound for free. It was lovely experience, it was a dream come true!!"
280,4.0,"My sister and I visited Gyeongbokgung, once without a hanbok (entrance fee is 3000krw/person if I'm not mistaken) and again with hanbok (free entry) for the fun of it. Visitors are not allowed to enter any of the buildings which are empty, however are free to walk everywhere. Everything is outdoor... The weather was pretty cold when we were there. The cafe and gift shop was our temporary hideout for snacks and hot tea. There are free English tours available at certain times during the day. We did not join the tour due to the cold weather. The guards change ceremony is also interesting to watch. This was one of the busiest palace we visited during our trip. We spent about 2-3 hours here."
281,5.0,"Beautiful, surrounded by water a classic Asian structure made of carved colourful wood and fine ceiling design and typical old Asian roof tile style. Asian classic."
282,5.0,"The palace is set against the impressive backdrop of Bugaksan Mountain and the grounds offer a great insight into the power and majesty of the Joseon royal court, the most long-lasting dynasty in Korean history.  There are English brochures at the ticket stand to aid foreign visitors.  I believe there are also guided tours, but we chose the self-guided option and used our brochures to walk the grounds and explore the sprawling compound.  Also on-site and free to enter: the Korean National Folk Museum and Korean National Palace Museum."
283,5.0,"It was zero degrees celsius when we visited but we just had to dress up in hanbok. I think doing so made it more special. It was unbelievably cold but it still fun. I opted not to get dressed in kimono when I visited Japan, this experience makes me want to go back and try the kimono."
284,4.0,"The Royal Palace is a must-see attraction if you want to appreciate the life style in the old Korean kingdom.  The actual palace is rather large, with a lot of empty spaces.  The actual living quarter for the residences are very small.  There are simple buildings with several rooms and courtyards.  In comparison, I found this Palace more formal than the Japanese.  The design is similar the one in Beijing; but in a much much smaller scale."
285,3.0,"While it’s sort of pretty with what there is, the palace grounds are really small and doesn’t really have much grandiosity to it. If compared to the forbidden palace, it pales greatly in comparison. Most (if not all) of the palace is reconstructed from a fire before being abandoned for a few centuries, so it doesn’t look or feel how an ancient structure would typically be. At the end of the palace, beyond it, there are some weird prison like structures that absolutely destroys the beauty of the mountain as a backdrop to the palace. Entry fee isn’t expensive though, at US$3, so it’s worth a visit if you’re exploring the area. Not really worth a detour."
286,5.0,"It was a very interesting experience We enjoyed watching the changing of the guard and hearing the history if the palace.  We chose to rent Korean dress and walk around which wass fun.  I would encourage this as many people chose to take their pictures with us.  It is amazing how large this palace is.  Unfortunately the weather was cold when we visited but it didn't dampen our experience.If you do go, there are not many places to eat in the area, so eat before you go to it."
287,4.0,"Well worth a visit!! Lots to see, I could easily spend a full day here! Its often very busy, and there were many school trips on the day that we went. Lots of people were dressed in traditional outfits and ealking around taking pictures too.Worth bearing in mind that it can be a little difficult at times with a stroller. There are ramps up and down most steps but the ground is uneven and rocky in places. My friend was ok wkth her stroller as it had big and solid wheels!"
288,5.0,"a big palace from the past, must visit spot if you come to seoul.many photo spot inside. a famous tourist spot but not so crowded. try to visit it in 4 different season, you'll find a different feelings."
289,5.0,My favorite place in Seoul. It's so rich in culture that I could stay the whole day and still not see and learn enough. A MUST go!!! 😄
290,5.0,"We were visiting 2018 Olympic Games and stopped fro few days in Seoul. Visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace was highlight of our visit, watching changes of guards, visiting different parts of palace was awesome. Korean history is reach, interesting and memorable."
291,5.0,To enhance your Korea experience.It is recommended to wear their traditional costume they call Hanbok. It’s amazing to stroll around this well preserve palace. Last time June 2017 the pavilion was renovated but the rest of the area is still accessible.
292,5.0,"It's also called The Northern Palace or The Royal Palace and it's the biggest of the five palaces in Seoul. In summer, it is open from 9 a.m. until 6:30 p.m. and closes on Tuesdays. You will need at least half a day to see it completely and good walking shoes which you can take off easily. I strongly recommend checking the official website in English and buying an Integrated Ticket that will allow you to save some money and to visit four palaces and a shrine. The ticket is worth 10,000 won. You can book it online and pay for it when you go into one of the palaces. In order to get there, the best way is to go to  Gyeongbokgung Station (Seoul Subway Line 3) and Exit 5 or go to Anguk Station (Seoul Subway Line 3) and Exit 1.  You can also take buses  No. 1020, 7025,109, 171, 172, 601 or 606 and get off at Gyeongbokgung Palace Bus StopIf you want to visit this palace with a tour, there are three tours in English every day. We decided to do it on our own at our own pace but we went on tours in other palaces and the guides are usually great and very professional.The most beautiful part was a temple in the middle of a lake.You can see the pictures on my blog.You will see people dressed in beautiful traditional Korean clothes called Hanbok. We mainly saw young groups of friends and couples. All five palaces waive admission fees for visitors wearing hanbok and there are shops that rent them. Mind you, we never saw a foreigner wearing a Hanbok.There was a small café in the palace and we had to sit there to have a drink and eat something because we were exhausted.All in all, this palace is a must and no matter how tired you end up it's totally worth it."
293,4.0,"You can reach this palace by using the subway train, the Gyeongbokgung station. Once you arrived, it is recommended to rent a Hanbok dress, because your picture will look more classic. Haha. You can walk about 300 meters to the left of this palace entrance to go to the Hanbok rental shop. This palace was a nice place to take a lot of pictures."
294,5.0,"It's definitely not as big as the Forbidden Palace in Beijing; however, it's still worth a visit. The layout is similar with gates and buildings where the Royalties would enjoy entertainment, and such. It's great to see the urban city behind the Palace and admission included a visit to the Folk Museum, which was worth a stopover to see their exhibitions. Great place to take photos if you decide to borrow and wear a hanbok."
