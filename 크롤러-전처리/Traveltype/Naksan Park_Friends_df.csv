We didn't pick the Naksan Park path, instead we climb the Ihwa Mural Village until we find the famous wall where all the K-Drama happening. It's nice and we'll probably hike the Naksan Park if it's not raining"

It was a good activity after 3 days of raining.. all the frustration from the previous rainy days was gone after arriving at the top. You will see beautiful view of city of Seoul from up the hill from 3 observation points... along with ample beautiful photo shoot opportunities. Definitely stress relieving .However, to get up here you have to do a bit of a hike. To me, the hike is not long, just a short 15 minutes hike but the paths were very steep at some points. Oh yes, before arriving at the entrance of this park, you have to hike up through the villages first , and here is very steep roads. So overall total time to reach the peak , for a non-fit potato like myself took around 45 minutes with lots of stops for photos. Wear suitable clothing as you will get sweaty, suitable shoes also for your dear feet's comfort."
2,5.0,Went in the evening and there were many locals there taking photos as well. It was a long climb from Hyehwa station but the view was awesome.
3,3.0,"Not bad for a half day trip. Nice view of the city on top of the hill. The old city wall is quite well maintained but quite tiring to walk uphill. Some stairs are too steep. I came in mid April and saw some cherry blossoms. Way beyond its peak but still nice to walk around. Near the entrance of the park, there is a mural village and a shopping street full of cafes and restaurants."

6,4.0,City walls make here's scenery perfect. Especially for sun set in a open day you can see the perfect combination of Seoul's city-nature combined face!
7,4.0,"I visited this place at night and though it was a bit of a walk from nearby Hyehwa station – and a steep climb in some areas – it was good exercise! This area is just great to hang out with friends, exercise, or take your pets for a walk. Also, along the outer perimeter of the area, and further up, along the face of the wall, the views of Seoul are really beautiful, particularly at night."
8,5.0,This place is incredibly beautiful. I recommend this park for everyone. I liked the weather over there because it's so calming and away from Seoul city. I felt the real fresh air in there
9,4.0,"It's a good park to visit if you bring some drinks at night, don't mind a 20 min steep walk, don't mind a confusing way up, and are already in the area.  There are bigger and better mountains."
