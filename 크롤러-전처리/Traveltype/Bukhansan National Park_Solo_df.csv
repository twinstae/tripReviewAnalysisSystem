0,5.0,"Come prepared with: water, food, good hiking shoes, and a healthy respect for the difficulty of the trail. I, a naive fool of a tourist who reluctantly works out 3 times a week, thought we could start our hike at 11am, pull off the short “difficult” trail (we did the trail to Baegundae from the fortress entrance to Ui-dong) in shoes with no grip whatsoever, and chill out at a cafe by 5pm. In early January. I slipped on ice twice, got in the way of many other local hikers who had clearly planned their hike better than I did, ran out of water at the peak (which was halfway through the trail), and minced my way down the snowy part second half with very cheap strap-on crampons (4-pronged, KRW7k from a roadside stall near the first entrance, I probably could have haggled). We eventually made it out of the park at 530pm. Which was sunset.Don’t be me. Plan your hike. Be as awesome as this view."
1,5.0,"Depending on your accommodation, there are different trailheads to reach the highest peak Baegundae peak. I personally started at Bukhansan Information Center where there are two different trails. The difficult (steeper) trail is just under 3km while the easy trail (didn’t attempt it) trail is slightly over 4km. On the difficult trail, there are a lot of steps, and you need to use the steel cable to overcome the vertical gaps at some point of time. When you finally see some walls, it means you are nearing the peak. To actually reach the peak, you need to use the steel cables to pull yourself up either the slopes or the steps. If you arrived late in winter, there’s going to be a long queue wanting to take the steps cos the slopes are just too slippy. Regardless the view at the peak is magnificent on a clear day. I took a third trail down the eastern side of the mountain to have a different feel of the mountain. Have fun hiking."
2,5.0,"For those who enjoy hiking, this is a great way to get the legs moving and see some great views of Seoul from above. I would warn that the hike is tough, so only recommended for those with hiking experience.I entered at the West side by taking the subway to Gupabal, then walking 30 mins to the park entrance (You can also take bus 704). I then hiked to the Baegundae peak via the ""easy"" route (as opposed to the ""expert"" route), then came down the mountain on the East side, eventually leading to Bukhansan Ui subway station. The whole hike took around 6 hours.Make sure you take plenty of water and snacks as there are no places to buy these after around 1km in. On the way down, there is a shop selling drinks, snacks and basic pot-noodle style meals at the Bukhansanseong fortress on the East side of the peak.Entry to the national park is free. Make sure you wear good hiking shoes as the terrain gets tough towards the top."
3,5.0,"I took the subway and arrived Gupabal station around 09:30hr. At the exit, there are already a group of local hikers queuing at the bus stop. They were all dressed in outdoor performance, which is part of their passion too. I joined the queue waiting for bus 704. However, when bus 8772 arrived, the local hikers were boarding the bus. I just followed suit as it could not be wrong, Entire bus is packed with hikers. Bus ride is only 10 mins ending at final stop. From the bus stop to the park entrance is a 15 mins walk. Along the way, I bought an isotonic drink from a mini mart, and kimbap, 2,500 won, from a street vendor. There is no entrance fee. At the base, there are many trails to various parts of the mountain. I just followed the crowd. Later on, I followed signs that point towards Baegundae Peak. The beginning part was easy, along well paved paths, stepping on large rocks, boardwalks as well as steel stairs. However, it got tougher with steeper incline. Towards the last 400m, I needed to use ropes, already anchored to ground, to pull myself up the granite slopes. Suggest to bring along gloves.I took about 3 hours to arrive at Baegundae peak. The summit is just a small platform with a Korean flag and a large stone inscribed with figure 836m. I needed to queue for 20 mins just to take photos, as the short stretch to the summit is narrow and single lane. After that, like all hikers, I rested just below the summit in the open space ground. I had my kimbap for lunch while enjoying the beautiful view - truly majestic, surrounded by multiple peaks against the clear blue sky. Overall, I was glad I finally managed to hike highest peak of Bukhansan National Park."
4,5.0,"I hiked up Baegundae peak, the tallest mountain in Bukhansan National Park, on my last day in Seoul.  It was completely worth it.  It's quite approachable in an afternoon, but just make sure that you have OK footwear.  I just wore tennis shoes, which worked OK, but I did slip and fall once on some loose rocks.  It also can be quite windy at the top.  The views of the surrounding park and Seoul are wonderful, and completely worth the trip if you at all enjoy hiking.  It's very easy to get to Bukhansan from the metro and buses, and quite cheap too.  If you're not sure you're at the right stop for the bus, it's usually quite obvious, because all the Koreans in colorful hiking gear will get off.Overall, I would highly recommend Bukhansan for anyone who loves the outdoors who is visiting Seoul.  It's a very beautiful area."
5,5.0,"Bukhansan, B in Korean is pronounced as P ""Puk’ansan"" -  Tallest Peak is Baegundae Peak at 836 m / 2,744 ft.Take Subway line 3 to Gupabal Station and get out at Exit 1. 180 degree turn around to the bus stop. Take Bus # 34/704/8772 bound for Bukhansanseong Fortress to the Bukhansan Mountain entrance bus stop (20 mins). 6 stops total, off at Bukhansan Ipgu, after Heongkuksa.‎ Sign in english in the bus. Turn left on exit of the bus, walk up to the next cross street and turn right (toward mtn). Stores along route to top up on food/drinks/gears if reqr. Can purchase a map at entrance for KRW $1000 or use sign posts and maps along the routes. At the last washroom, there is a bridge crossing the stream. Do not cross but use the dirt trail south of the stream, it's an interpretive trail (shorter & less travel) or take main trail (paved then packed). Both routes will link up near a bridge in order to cross the bridge.I returned down the other side of the mountain along the old fortress wall through Daedongmun Gate route to Akademi Info Center. Once outside the park, walk down maybe 50 m to the bus stop. Catch Bus #1 to Suyu metro station on line 4.From Bukhansanseong Info center to Baegundae Peak approx 4.3 kms. From peak to Akademi Info Center approx 4.8 kms. Time for each leg based on your fitness level and crowds on the trail(s). I did it on Friday 14 Jun starting at 1pm from the entrance. Low crowds. Enjoy!"
6,5.0,"I have done Yeongbong Peak, it took me about 30 mins to be there. If you are new to hiking, I recommend you this peak"
7,5.0,Most reviews I read talked about approaching the peak from the west side of the park. That takes a metro and bus to get to. They also talked about crowds. There are 10 entrances. I chose to enter from Dobongsan side on the east. It’s a mile from the metro stop so you can just walk there and it was very sparsely populated. Really an amazing park so close to an urban area. It’s very rocky and solid shoes are a must.
8,5.0,"Really amazing hiking. There weren't that many flowers when I visited in early April.- The shortest route for Baegundae Summit is to start from Ui Line 'Bukhansan Ui' Station and coming back.- My recommmendation is Bukhansan Ui Station-Ui Ranger Station(Baegun Visitor Center)-Harujae-Baegunbong Ammun Gate-Baegundae Summit-Baegunbong Ammun Gate(passing)-Yongammun Gate-Doseonsa Temple-Ui Ranger Station.- Other popular starting point is Gupabal Station. So, the route of starting from here and ending at Bukhansan Ui Station is also popular.- It was more challenging than I thought. Some tracks require grabbing railings or ropes. But, if you concentrate, it's not that risky. A fatigue will be an enemy too.- For those who jump into the Bukhansan and are afraid of hiking, there are other walk-around courses called as Bukhansan Dule-gil. This is more recommended to kids and seniors."
9,5.0,"This mountain is perfectly located just north of Seoul.     It offers several hiking trail options but due to its height and steep gradient, it is definitely not recommended for everyone though.     Some of the rocky hills are massive and truly impressive to look at.    Really enjoyed hiking here for a few hours."
10,5.0,"As an experienced hiker (for comparison, I did the longest route up and down Mt. Halla in just under 5 hours), I took the longest/hardest route to the top, which was quite fun. For less experienced hikers, there are easier and shorter paths to the top. The path I took had an area where you had to climb up rocks assisted by a sturdy rope that was installed at the top. Along the way, I found a wild snake among the rocks and saw some other animals and birds you'd never see in the city center. It was a nice escape to nature from bustling city life in central Seoul. The fall foliage was beautiful (although not quite at their peak as I went in late-September) and I imagine going here on any clear day (when the air quality is decent) would be well worth it for those who enjoy outdoor activities. The entire hike up took about an hour and another hour down with some time spent at the top and short photo breaks along the way. The trail I took was incredibly peaceful (there was literally no one else there), and I thoroughly enjoyed the solitude being in nature... until I got closer to the top, then there were a ton of other hikers :D."
11,4.0,"Manageable climb to the peak. Took about 1h45m to 2h to ascend. Unable to estimate the time needed to descend as I fell and sprained my ankle just after leaving the peak. Due to the rocky terrain, recommend wearing high-cut hiking boots and also walking stick. Otherwise, it was a good solo experience and awesome view at the peak. It was windy (at the peak) and cooling hike in early Sep 2018."
12,5.0,"A lot of amazing trails to choose from to get up one of the many peaks. Many spots to stop along the way to admire the view, but the true reward is when you finally reach one of the peaks."
13,5.0,"Took the subway and followed another hiker to a nearby bus-stop, where, by this time, was already over-flowing with local hikers.  Admittedly, it was a Sunday and it was a choice day, since hiking alone, my preference is to encounter hikers along the way.I made it to the peak, and boy, was it tough!  I wasn’t expecting snow/sleets and had to walk gingerly as I was devoid of crampons.  Definitely worth the hike as one could view downtorn Seoul from the top!  The hike itself was satisfying, as with all other mountains, is never short of scrambling over huge boulders - rope and support handles were aptly anchored."
14,5.0,"Amazing escape from the city. Temples, ancient gates and walls and the serenity of nature. Big enough for several days of hiking."
15,3.0,Worth jumping on the metro and then getting a local bus.  Lovely park.  Especially nice in the autumn as the leaves change colour.
16,5.0,"On Saturday morning, I woke up and decided to climb Bukhansan Mountain. I took the subway to Gireum Station (Line 4, exit 3) and took the bus 110B and got off at the last stop. I then looked for the mountain and headed towards it!It was a gorgeous fall day. Not busy. Saw some older Korean people taking pictures and babies pondering their future. There are many trails and is not over strenuous. Worth the trip and a good way to get your step count up."
17,5.0,"Visited the park on 2nd November morning. Rocked up early @ about 7.15am to avoid the crowds. Had a friend who so kindly drove me to the trailhead so I cannot share on the public transport to the trailhead. I wanted to get up to Baegundae Peak so i started the hike at Bukhansanseong Information Centre.Restrooms available for use before you start so no issues there. The shops were not opened yet so if planning to start early, pls bring along all your food/water/equipment and don't hope to pick everything up here before your hike!The trail was well marked, with signs showing you where to go to get to the peak. Difficulty: - starts off easy with slight inclination and well paved. - hard to get lost all the way through right up to the peak. - trail gets difficult as you progress. as you get close to the peak, you will need the help of the metal ropes to pull yourself up the rocks. the rock face can be quite slippery even in great weather when i was hiking up. i can imagine it would be very difficult if it was raining. - Rocks are large and vertically challenged pple (like me ha) really need to scramble and pull yourself up and over. - Overall: moderate difficulty. Shoes:- trail /hiking shoes advised. Views:- absolutely awesome! was treated to fall colours all the way through the hike. =) made the workout worth it! I believe there are several ways up to the this peak. I came down the mountain via another route and ended up at the Bukhansan National Park Ui Ranger Station (followed signs for 'Ui Descent Route') and walked to the Bukhansan Ui Train Station and took the train back to the hotel=)A Definite MUST DO while in Seoul!"
18,5.0,By the time we were done my step tracker said we'd walked 16.75km. The majority of the trail is large rocks that you must scramble over. This is a strenuous hike. We didn't see any water filling stations on the trail so definitely make sure to bring water with you. Bathrooms are very limited so plan ahead.The views at the top are well worth the hike. It was breath-taking. There is also plenty of open rock front at the top for people to stop and have a break.
19,5.0,"Will be providing a long review as I found the information online kinda confusing and not too much of info. So hoping this review will be able to help anyone who is going at this time. I went in late October (on a Sun) as it was known to be one of the nicest view in Autumn. I reached Gupbal station, exit 2 and took bus 8772 (though online mentioned 704, but I followed the crowd). Temperature is around 11 degree when I starting to hike at around 12.30pm. Contrary to what other people said online, there wasn’t as many people as mentioned. Probably ‘cause I started quite late. Apparently there will have a few paths available to hike. Easy, intermediate and expert. I don’t understand Korea language, but I just wanted to reach to the highest peak - Baegundae.So basically there are few mountains in Bukhansan National Park. The highest stands at 832m which is the Baegundae peak, and also I believe might be the hardest as well. From the starting point, the distance is somehow 4.5km to the peak. I took about 3.5 hours to reach to the peak. Oh let me side track awhile to talk about my dress code. I wore an inner shirt and pants, on top with a t-shirt and hiking pants, followed by a Columbia hiking jacket. Shoe, is just a normal sport shoe. I wanted to bring light, otherwise would recommend wearing a hiking shoe for a better grip. Brought a pair of gloves as well (would say this a must).Well.. the beginning 2 hours, likely you will feel hot instead. Somewhere in the middle of the hike... it suddenly rain and was raining ice cubes instead of droplets. It was then very cold and windy as well. The tough part begins at around 1.5km to the peak. Where they steep slopes and for me, I have to rely much on the wired poles or using my hands to pull myself up (gloves comes in super handy and it was cold). Furthermore, the slopes were kinda of slippery especially with a sport shoe. Many times I thought I might couldn’t make it back. Talking about coming down... there will be a fortress (about 300m before the peak). There’s two ways to go down. One is how you came up (for me it will be a 4.5km down), and the other is 1.8km down to the information center (apparently there’s many ways to come up depending on where you starting). So logically, I took the 1.8km down. It took about 30 mins to the information center but you will need to continue to walk about 20 mins to reach to the subway which is the Bukhansan UI station. ConclusionApparently, there’s a shorter alternative to go up to the peak which should takes like about 2 hours. Regardless, at the last between 600m and 300m, it will be tough. Parents need to supervise and pay many attention to children if they going for this highest peak. I find is not a joke when it rain. That aside... the whole hiking trail is so nice~"
20,5.0,"I visited here from Dobongsan metro station, which avoided an extra bus journey. It was a perfect place to do the trekking to over 700metres. The climb towards the end was not easy, but so worth it. The views on the trek was incredible. One of my best days out ever. I joined the tradition of the Koreans and drank thier rice wine on the day. Lovely drink it is too. Highly highly highly recommended."
21,4.0,"I recommend coming here as early as possible. It is a large park and best visited 2 times (once for the east side and once for the west side). If you only come once, the west side is more attractive. The east side was mostly grueling and not enjoyable due to the rocky trails and gnats everywhere. It is rare for me to want a hike to end but I was relieved to finish. Fortunately, I went to the west part later and it was excellent. Trails are much easier overall (only a small portion was rocky). It is steep to  get to the top so bring enough water. The views are fantastic from the top. My regret was not starting earlier the 2nd trip since I had to skip part of the park. I would definitely visit the western part again. The guide warned about crowds but due to record breaking heat and it being a weekday, it was not too crowded. I read to avoid autumn weekends though."
22,5.0,"Climbed up Baegundae Peak through the valley route. Takes about 3hours and the climb is no joke. The difficulty level gets higher the nearer you are to the peak. The view at the top is breathtaking. You can choose the same way back or take another route - Ui Dong route (which i did and its way easier). You will exit the other gate of Bukhansan.You get get a map for 1000KRW ar the front gate.You gotta make sure you pack enough water and perhaps energy bars. Use hiking shoes instead of normal shoes. The track is really a kill on normal shoes. You will be stepping on rocks of various shapes and sizes.Directions:- Gubapal Station- Exit 1- Bus 8772 (lesser stops) or 34 (lots of stops)Alternatively, there is a new line UI Trans (grey line) at the top of the train map. You can find two stations for Bukhansan.From what i know, the trails are closed from15 Feb - 15 May01 Nov - 15 Dec"
23,5.0,"It took me around 2h 20m to reach the top inclusive of resting. Coming down is around the same duration as you got to move downwards slowly. Really nice view! I went on a Monday and was expecting a huge crowd since this is the day most museums are closed, but there were just sporadic hikers along the way. It is pretty steep and rocky but nothing too crazy. Wouldn’t recommend this for young children though."
24,5.0,"I looked for an accurate time for the hike to baegundae peak and found conflicting reports. I am a steady but not serious walker and it took me 2.5 hours up and 1.5 hours down. The signs can be a big misleading as lots seem to sign for the peak - I actually went wrong and ended up at another peak meaning I lost time to descend from that and then walk up to begundae - so it may well be less that 2.5 hours up. The last km or so is quite challenging with big boulder steps and the climb to the summit involves using wired fences - these are safe but you will need a head for heights. The flag at the top is the ultimate photo spot. The walk wasn’t that busy and I often didn’t see anyone - unusual that this was a Saturday but may be it was too hot. This was my second walk in South Korea - first was uksanbawi Rock- begundae was higher, more challenging but also more spectacular!"
25,5.0,"Especially beautiful in the Autumn, though there are crowds, everyone is pleasant and it's a really nice way to enjoy the space a little outside Seoul. Just beware of American and Chinese tourists, they're the only rude ones and they will embarrass you by playing weird loud music and trying to knock you off the mountain."
26,4.0,not so far from seoul taking metro & one of good hiking place in korea. i love the view & overall environment. not so tourism place but getting many local people to do the hiking. spend a day to do it esp for autumn. that was quite beautiful & peaceful place. love it.
27,5.0,"I went here at the end of my Seoul trip to hike the Bukhansanseong trail (the most popular trail) to Baegundae Peak, a bit overconfident and with no actual hiking gear and no prior hiking experience and with no hiking partner and just slightly above average fitness level. I did bring 4 bottles of water and walking shoes with decent grip though. It was definately doable, but I would highly suggest that you bring actual hiking shoes, gloves, plenty of water, a snack, sunscreen and maybe some insect spray if you visit during summer like I did. Why? Because near the top the the sun is scorching, and the rocks you climb are smooth and slippery and you have to drag yourself up with steel wires that can hurt your hands without gloves. And near the bottom of the mountain are plenty of mosquitoes and some Giant Asian Hornets (can actually kill humans if stung many times). All that said, this truly is an unforgettable experience with some awe inspiring scenery and views and I would highly recommend it if you're well prepared.Getting to the Bukhansanseong Trail: Take subway line 3 and get off and Gupabal exit 4 and go to the bus stops in front of you and take bus 34, 704 or 8772 to Bukhansan Ipgu (it shows on the display at the front of the bus). When you exit, go left in the direction the bus was going and take the next right turn and keep going forward until you see the park information booth on your left near a Bukhansan National Park sign (where you can buy a map for 1000 won if you want).And if you don't want to backtrack, like me, you can take the Daedongmun Gate route back down after reaching Baegundae Peak. To access that route, backtrack past the stone gate near the peak and go down the stairs a little bit until you see a split, where you take a left turn and keep following the signs for Daedongmun (Gate). Keep in mind that this route is a bit longer and has some additional uphill hiking, but you get to walk along the Bukhansanseong Fortress wall and after crossing the Daedongmun Gate there will be some very beautiful creaks and views. Many more mosquitoes here than the previous route though so keep that in mind. After getting down this route at the Academy Park Information Center you will have a bus stop just past the info center on your right side, for bus number 1, which you can take to Suyu station, where you can take subway line 4 back to Seoul Station.This hike took me in total 5 hours at a brisk pace with only short water and photo breaks. 2 hours to the peak, and 3 hours down (including a 20 min stop at the peak). Skipping the Daedongmun route, and backtracking instead would probably be a bit faster going down."
28,4.0,"I happened to be able to go hiking in Bukhansan on a Wednesday by myself.  In Seoul, having anyplace that is not crowded is an amazing luxury!  In addition, weather was a perfect 60 degreees F, skies were crystal clear and the spring was just blooming everywhere.  I wish I could have done more--but climbing up Wonhyobong Peak was enough for me--it took about an hour and change, plus a little extra to look around.  Coming down was a lot faster (duh).  Apparently there was a waterfall on the other side but I didn't do my research on the trails and so forth, so I missed it.  Trails are not that clear at the bottom/park entry, but once you get on a path it is well-maintained and not hard to follow."
29,5.0,"A really nice place for hiking if you're in Seoul. It'll take about 2 hours to go to top of the mountain. I went alone in a Sunday and there I met one of the locals and he helped to understand the trails. Also,  there're signals to direct you though the trail and tell you about the distances either you going up or down."
30,4.0,"As it was my third time in Seoul, I decided to go exploring outside the city. I went hiking in this NP. At arrival at the subway station, just follow the locals ;-). At the NP gate, a ranger came directly to me to explain in English how to fo to one of the peaks, and gave me a map in English. Only confirming my experience with Koreans: very helpful and enjoyable people."
31,5.0,"Bukhansan national park is just near the city of Seoul and it is easy to get there by public transport. There are many hiking routes to take, most people start from the east but I start from the west and come down by the east. I trusted maps.me and found this weird path that start from like a small village. The route require you to hike up one of the peak (forget the name), then proceed to follow the path downhill and hike up Baegundae Peak which is the highest peak with the Korean flag on it. The path I took was harder but shorter as compare to the normal route people take from the entrance. I did stumble upon a few old forts and bunkers along the way. Take a look at the photos for the views itself."
32,5.0,"If you’re looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of Seoul and you enjoy hiking in the outdoors, I highly recommend climbing one of the peaks in beautiful Bukhansan National Park.  I climbed the tallest peak, Baegundae Peak, and it took me 2.5 hours to get to the top (I am a 52 year old woman, in relatively good shape).  The climb is moderately challenging, and there are sections with chains and railing to help you along.  In winter, you should attach chains or spikes to your shoes to climb on snow and ice.  I went in both November and late December, and I enjoyed both the beautiful foliage of fall and the lovely snow in winter.For those like me with no car, Bukhansan National Park is easy to get to using the metro and bus.  Take the metro to the Gupabal stop.  From there, take bus #34, 704, or 8772 (you will see other hikers fully decked out in hiking attire).  The bus will take you to the stop that leads to the main entrance of the park.  It was pretty obvious to me which stop it was, especially when all of the other hikers got off at the same stop.  From the bus stop you will need to walk for 5 minutes or so to get to the park entrance.  Along the way, you will pass shops that sell hiking gear, clothing, walking sticks, snacks, etc.Bukhansan has many different trails to choose from, of varying degrees of difficulty and length.  There are also different peaks to choose from.  I chose the highest and loved it!  The views are spectacular, and you can also visit a temple along the way.  The trails are marked pretty well, and there are always other hikers around since it is a very popular pastime for Koreans.  In fact, try to do the hike during the week, if you can.  It gets super crowded on the weekends.  Bring water and a snack, and enjoy!"
33,5.0,"This was my very first solo hike up a mountain..took the Bugandae trail up to the peak...The hike up was challenging enough especially towards the  top where i had to use steel cables to haul myself up...the trail was very scenic during autumn and  i was amused to see local hikers much older than I zipping past me with ease while I was trudging slowly trying to catch my breath! The view at the top was breathtaking and there's a flat rock where everyone would sit to have their lunch and njoy the view of Seoul city. Took almost 3 hours to reach the peak from the main entrance with some photo stops along the way and another 3 hours down the same way. On the way down, i slipped a few times as I wasn't wearing proper hiking boots and the rocks were slippery.  So anyone who wants to do this, please wear hiking boots for safety. Overall, this was a great experience and the highlight of my trip in Seoul!"
34,5.0,I wanted to climb Baegundae peak while visiting Seoul. Getting there was a bit confusing but basically just follow people in hiking gear. I am not a very athletic person so when I say this climb was difficult it was difficult. It took me a total of 5 hours to climb up and down including breaks. It was so rewarding to climb though because of the view from the top. I visited in autumn so the park was beautiful and the weather was nice and cool. Make sure you pack a lot of water and snacks. It’s a whole day event.
35,4.0,But the mountain was gorgeous!  I will return to this place using the other side for goin up/down the Peak. It was a wonderful autumn.
36,5.0,"The view at the top is much better than the view at Hallasan on Jeju Island. Hallasan is a little more difficult, maybe, but this mountain is actually beautiful. The scenery starts to look amazing after climbing maybe 2/3 of the way to the top. Favorite hike so far"
37,5.0,"I went hiking by myself and was a little worried whether I could find the way to the top or not but it's well signed and I had no trouble getting up there. It's a lovely hike, I was there when all the autumn colours came out and the views from the top are spectacular! Really beautiful and so nice to be out of the city and surrounded by nature and breath in fresh air. Take some food and drinks with you and you'll have the best day!"
38,4.0,I hiked around 2nd wk of November. I took the train to Gupabal ( Line 3) went to Exit 1 then took bus #704. If you hike on a weekend expect a lot of people.I went to Baegundae trail. There were signs in English but I noticed that after about 1km I couldn't figure out where exactly I was. Bring food so you can eat at the summit. You will find a spot no matter how crowded it gets.  I started around 10am and was able to get back by 4pm. You should do this when you go to Korea. Regardless if you are a hardcore hiker or not. It's an awesome experience!
39,5.0,"it's not too high, but it's really good view! it takes just 5 hours to get a top. specially sunset fi very nice!"
40,5.0,"This is a hiking park. It is recommended you wear the right outfit and bring lots of liquids. It is not for beginners, you can make it as long as you have worked out in the past because the paths to go up hill are tough. Once you reach the top, you will have the best reward which is a great view of Seoul and other mountains."
41,5.0,A 12 hour stop at Seoul's Incheon International airport left me eager to get out and move around a bit. I decided to head for Bukhansan National Park to climb the highest peak 'Baegundae' via the vertical ridge route. I left my bags in a locker that cost about $9 and took a taxi (the only transit available at 4am). The park had signs in english at all of the trail intersections so it wasn't difficult to find my way. What started as a rocky trail climbing to better and better views quickly escalated into some pretty committed bouldering on Joshua tree-like rock overlooking the city. I followed some different trails out of the park and ran all the way to a train station where I got directions to the airport line in broken english. After returning to the airport I used the free transit shower and took a nap in the transit nap area. What a brilliant way to spend the day in a new place 👌👌👌
42,5.0,"I took the metro and got off at Dobongsan Station which is roughly 45 minutes by train from city centre. You get off the train and only have to follow all the Korean hikers 😄. The park entrance is maybe 15 mins by foot and you pass many equipment stores that provide EVERYTHING for hining (you understand once you are there) and a lot of convenience stores and street stores so you can purchase you water and food supplies.At the park entrance the rangers will explain the different routes in this huge park. I chose the Jaunbong which is the Dongbonsan Peak. Total distance going up only 3.3 km. Follow the signs towards Madangbawi which is the big rock. This 2.5 km will take you about one hour. Rest at the rock and start the hile to the three peaks and expect another hour.On a beautiful day you habe fantastic views on SEL!I decided to go back the same way to the rock and then towards Seongdowon temple because lateron towards the ranger station you will find the small river to cool your feet.My recommendations: i hiked on a Monday and had some fellow hikers, not sure if it was due to a weekday or the hot temperatures- take enough water supplies as you can only resupply at the gates. Total hiking incl brakes was 4 hours. Hiking gear especially boots are highly recommended. Njoy!"
43,5.0,"I hiked it through the easiest and shortest course, (Dosunsa course)I got off from Su-yu station, and grab a taxi to Dosunsa. It took me about 2.5 hours, the last half hour was quite challenging (do not wear Vans shoes when you go up this mountain lol) At the peak, I mean it was really worth it. The weather was perfect and amazing. But I recommend you to wear proper shoes and make sure to bring your water and towel."
44,5.0,"I think it's fair to say the hike to Baegundae Peak is pretty tough for the casual or non-hiker, but is definitely worth it. Not just for the views from the summit, but for all the gorgeous scenery along the way.The trails are well signposted and the very steepest sections have cables/steps to help you along.There's lots of trails to choose from and more than one way to Baegundae Peak itself, so I would recommend coming down a different trail to whichever one you take up in order to see more of this lovely park.A quick google search will give you easy instructions on how to get to the park from Seoul."
45,5.0,"I initially found most the reviews pointing towards taking the subway to gupabal/gireum. With a stroke of (bad) luck, I woke up late on the day I planned to visit Bukhansan. Googled a little and found that the quickest way to reach the Baegundae peak was via taking the subway to Suyu station exit 3, crossing the road to the busstop in the middle of the road and taking bus 120. The bus 120 will stop at the bus terminal. Here it gets tricky, I got lucky and spotted the shuttle bus that takes temple visitors to Dosunsa Temple which is the base of the climbing trail. There isn't a sign or any counter that I could see that indicated that so maybe it would be helpful to ask anyone around. The kind bus uncle asked me ""Dosunsa""? and pointed me up the bus. Prepare 1000won but you don't have to give it to the bus uncle - when we reached the temple destination, there will be a donation box of sorts once you alight the bus, place it in there. From there, the entrance towards the trail sort of starts. I arrived at the temple/entrance at 2pm (I wouldn't recommend reaching there so late, I was really taking my chances, I thought I'd be the last one ascending but there were a couple more people behind me soon after. I didn't want to descend when the sun was setting so I had to maintain a rather regular pace) I reached the peak at around 3.30pm, it took me around 1.5hrs. There are signages along the way that are in English so that's helpful. There weren't many people taking the same path, perhaps this path's view isn't as nice. The view's good, it would have been better if it wasn't cloudy. I started the descent at around 4pm and reach the starting point at around 5pm. It was rather slippery going down so I'd definitely recommend actually hiking shoes, I foolishly brought my old running shoes in hopes that I could use and throw it after the hike, bad mistake. I had to use my hands a lot so a pair of gloves would be useful, the ropes are cold. The same shuttle bus would take you down to the bus terminal. There is a time schedule near the place where the shuttle bus stopped (I took the bus at 5.20pm, there was one at 4.50pm) So thereafter it's the same journey back to the subway station Suyu. I would have wanted to try a different trail down but it was getting late and I didn't want to risk descending in the dark with no clue how to get out. But it's a doable hike and I did enjoy myself, good for day trips for tourists who are interested to see nature.Done on 3 Apr 2017"
46,5.0,"I took the 160 bus from Geondeok station and transferred to 162 at the Samseongyo Bridge Hamsung Uni. to end up at Jeongneung Daewoo Apt, which was a 15-20 min. walk from where I started the climb. The buses are good in terms of the fact that they convey in English the next stop -- pay attention and you will be fine. Transportation took about 1.5 hour.The total hike took about 5 hours in total to reach to the Peak and back (my Fitbit tells me that I have walked 21 km today, but believe the walk itself is about 10-14 km from start to finish). Don't give up -- it is totally worth it! Beautiful view, a nice cabin where you can enjoy hot ramen on the way down, and the possibility to reward yourself with sauna at Back Doo San sauna on the way down. The sauna is a bit run down, and not the most elegant sauna that I have attended in Korea/Japan, but it was extremely comfortable to feel hot simmering water for sore legs. Bring lots of water and hot clothes (I walked in March and it was still snow at some few spots). There are signs that can guide you, and helpful locals  -- enjoy!"
47,5.0,"Wow, getting to the top was amazing, took the easier route up 1.9 km from the beagundae starting point, then took the 3.4 km down the other side.  Went around 9 am on a weekday and there were only a few people at the top, coming down there were a lot more people. Hiked there two days, wish I could do more."
48,5.0,I loved the idea of being able to hike a mountain in the middle of a metro city! a must do in Seoul.
49,5.0,Hiked this area almost every weekend. There is a wide variety of trails so that you can keep coming up with new routes every time you visit. Great view of Seoul once you get to the peaks as well.
50,5.0,After the bussle of the cities it is great to get refreshed by taking a hike in the National Park.  Work a few hours.
51,5.0,"Went hiking there in the morning and almost have the plave to ourselves. Koreans are late risers. Excellent hike up the Baegundae takes you 2 hrs to go up and the same to go down. And than take a great lunch afterwards, can not get better. All you need is good shoes since path is very rocky and some water and snacks and you can go. Path can get very crowded and the top is only a small place so if you start late prepare to stay in the hikers queue!"
52,5.0,"Took the tube from Anguk to Gopabal then the bus (I have forgotten the bus number) arrived at the park very early on a Wednesday morning, about 7.00 am and it was still a bit dark and I appeared to be the only one there.  Two other people soon turned up so I just followed them. It took me about 6 hours to do the round trip to the peak with a few stops for rest and also to take in the stunning views.  The climb was beautiful through wooded areas with lots of birdlife (many woodpeckers) and squirrels.  The foliage was autumnal with beautiful colours.I saw very few people on my way up and there were only about 5 or 6 at the summit. It is a hard climb but perfectly doable with reasonable fitness.  I am a 60 year old female and I made it with no mishaps other than some wobbly legs on the way down.Well worth the minimal trouble of getting there and I would advise going as early as possible to avoid any crowds.  I did meet more people as I came back down. A good day out and I am so glad I made the effort as the scenery was stunning, especially at the peak when the mist appeared making the mountains look much more foreboding than they actually were."
53,5.0,"Wow, where do I start? How about you can get there by SUBWAY? If you go in the fall, you will see the most incredible display of fall colors this side of New England. People all over Asia fly to Korea in the fall to witness the colors turning at Nami Island, but this hike is much more hard-core and cool. It's supposedly only 2 hours to get to the top, but you'll want to budget more time for hiking it, especially in the fall, because you'll want to take a lot of pictures and also, that last 1-2 kilometers is GRUELING. I did okay, despite the fact that I only brought water and no food. Was kicking myself about that, because it would have been fantastic to eat a sandwich at various points along the way. There were some poor people I heard along the way seriously struggling, making groaning sounds with every single step. I'm not sure they even made it all the way. The last kilometer or so is cables, and I think anyone with a fear of heights probably shouldn't do this hike at all. There's a fair bit of scrambling. I definitely used my hands quite a bit. It's somewhat like the cable section of Half Dome in Yosemite, but maybe even more technical (although at least, compared to Half Dome, this hike is much shorter).The views at the top are spectacular. In one direction, all of Seoul is spread out before you. And in the other, mountains. The mountains here have a gorgeous shape. And there is a mix of granite and trees, so they are especially photogenic. Plus, there was a family of 3 cute kitties at the top! I cannot emphasize enough how fun this hike was. I did the hike on a beautiful autumn Thursday afternoon, starting from the national park entrance (bus 704 from Gupabal Station) at 12:30 and coming back by 5pm. I didn't use poles or gloves, but I think they would have been handy. Not a hike for those with bad knees! A lot of rocks. The cables weren't rusty at least, so gloves are not essential but I think they would have made going down a bit more comfortable. I am so glad I did this before leaving Seoul. I think this hike should be on any hiker's bucket list!"
54,5.0,"This is not an easy hike! Lots of steps and boulders to climb steeply to. Its a great work out. Do not climb if it rains or have rained few hours before your hike. it can be slippery. But end of the day, when you reach to the top, and get motivated by the locals to move; its all worth it. Stunning view! You get to see lots of great scenery and views. Every hikers dream. 2.5 hours to get up and 1 hour to get down. Enjoy!"
55,5.0,Absolutely beautiful and well worth a trip. Very easy to get to via bus. A stunning natural landscape.
56,5.0,"For a hiker visiting Seoul, I would say Bukhansan is a must.  There must be few places where one can take the subway to a National Park and hike a nice trail.There are many hiking options.  This review is for Dobongson Peak (aka Jaunbong), one of the most popular hikes.  Take the subway to Dobongson (not Dobong, the stop just before).  It's a pretty long ride from the city (40-50 minutes).You don't need a map or gps to get to the entrance from the subway.  Cross the street, and follow the long line of hikers who know where they're going, or the shops that line the path from the subway to the NP entrance.Once there, pick up a map from the rangers.  The ranger recommended the popular trail (highlighted in picture).  The trail to Jaunbong is only about 5 miles (5.12 with several sidetracks), but it's a 1900+ feet ascent.  There are several sidetrails to temples.  I recommend a visit to Cheonchuksa, which requires a detour.  Most other temples are right on the highlighted route.  The junctions are not obvious at times, and they are not always marked in English.  However, if you keep going up, you will likely find your way there eventually.Hiking boots / poles are helpful, but not essential.  I went on sneakers because I didn't want to pick my boots / poles.  Prepare for some slippage, esp on the way down.  However, the trails are very well maintained (though it is possible to get slightly lost).  Most of the trail is in the shade.  There are many stop areas.  You need to bring water and food for sure.The peak gets a little crowded, but the views are amazing.  There's a little stream at the bottom where people like to hang out and have a picnic.Because of its easy access, the park must be a madhouse at times.  It was mildly crowded when I went on a weekday morning.  I read somewhere that it's the highest hiker / area NP in the world.There are many outdoor-gear stores on the way.  The stuff is not cheaper than back in nyc.  There are also many little restaurants that dot your path, and a couple of 7-11s for drinks, etc.  There are several bathrooms at the base."
57,5.0,"The Seoul City wall goes straight through this park. This is a military zone, so take your passport and get there in plenty of time. Some parts are steep. All the great views have a sign saying no photographs. What a shame. A great day walking."
58,5.0,"I took the subway to Dobongsan station. Exit left and followed the hikers to the park.  I asked at the Information Center for hike suggestions and a map in English.  Also filled up my water.  Ample water stations and bathrooms. Very well organized park. I hiked to Madangbawi Rock.  I loved it. Stopped at a couple of temples, and enjoyed the fantastic view at the rock.  It was about 3 hours round trip taking my time and enjoying the experience."
59,5.0,"What I thought would be an OK hike turned out to be pretty awesome! I planned to do a trail that was approximately 5.6 km long, however when I reach the gate the ranger recommended a different route to take that would lead me to visit the mountain peaks and several temples. I was spontaneous enough to agree on the route he suggested so 7 hours and 13 km later I was exhausted but soooo satisfied at the same time! The natural beauty of the mountain blows your breath away. The temples within the mountain are majestic and are visited by Monks from all around. TIPS: things to take with you that I wish I had brought along: extra water, food, toilet paper, extra pair of clothes, towel as you can cool down in the river pools, for those who don't like mosquitoes take insect repellent. NOTE: only attempt the hike to the peak of the mountain if you are in good health as it is physically challenging at some points and you could over exhaust yourself if you don't take your time."
60,5.0,"Great.  Would recommend 3h hike not more in hot summer weather.  It's not an easy hike if you are not used to steep mountain with lots of rock. Chance was our guide.  He was great.  Korean sauna experience was ok, not great.  Would probably skip if you have korean sauna in your hotel.  Don't skip lunch with the guide."
61,5.0,Difficult to rate because this park actually covers a very large area of northern Seoul. Nice walking paths. Families picnic on weekends. Used to be cleaner but seems Koreans are leaving more trash behind these days.
62,4.0,"If you head there on a clear day, you would be able to see some spectacular views. Unfortunately, there was a bit of an overcast when I went.The treks are all clearly labeled, so you won't get lost. I hiked up to Daeseongmun and Bogungman which is where the ancient fortress wall is. The roundtrip took about 3 hours to do, well worth the hike and definitely a great workout!"
63,5.0,Best of trail in Seoul.Panorama mountain veiw.Iong and short course trails.Wonderful and Amasing trekking.
64,5.0,"I love this park. I went on a climbing trip here and the area is just jaw droppingly beautiful. If recommend a stop by here for any adventure traveller, or even just for a Sunday afternoon hike and picnic."
65,4.0,"The national park is beautiful. Some trails are easy, some exhausting - so something for everyone. Really astonishing is the trail which crosses the so called dinosaur ridge - because it looks like the stony back of a dinosaur. Really nice, but not really easy to hike. If you´re fit or sometimes hiking you can make it though. Not just for real pros."
66,5.0,"I very highly recommend the temple stay at Geumsunsa, which is right along a path up the mountain. On a lovely two hour hike, I only saw two other people. The view from the temple is astounding."
67,5.0,"Spent a day walking up to the Dobong Peak, it was pretty hard but local seniors did it, I should too! It was awesome scenery from 700 meters and walk down was easier :D There re easier routes too and you can always turn back. But definitely worth it!"
68,5.0,"I hiked to bukhansanseong (bukhansan fortress) which took me approximately 3 hours return. The hike was difficult but the amazing views at the top and feeling of accomplishment were worth it. There's a reason the locals all have hiking poles! There were a few small groups of people and a few other solo hikers. People stopped to say hello. I saw some locals eating a picnic at the fortress, I would definitely recommend that you bring food. Bringing water is also important, but there are springs you can drink from along the path as well.There are plenty of English signs to help you find your way once you are on the trail. You can also pick up an English map at the visitor centre located at the park entrance. Plan to spend the whole day here and dress appropriately - especially shoes. Admission to the park is free, they are open during daylight hours. I took the train to Gireum (subway line 4) and then the 143 bus. Follow the local hikers if you are lost."
69,5.0,"I love being able to get to the mountains in Seoul on public transportation. If you are up for a challenge, climbing Bukhansan is a great half/full day activity. I didn't plan my hike when I went, but I would recommend planning a route so you can get to the peak you want to reach with an efficient path. This is a strenuous climb so make sure you are ready to walk a few miles uphill/stairs. I went on a weekday morning from 7am and it was very quiet and peaceful. I didn't see more than 50 people during my climb. I think it's much more crowded on the weekends. Foliage in spring is a little sparse on the mountain, so next time I want to visit in Autumn when all of the leaves change colors."
70,5.0,"Huge national park in the middle of Seoul. Well worth a day trip. Plan ahead, there are several peaks to climb and temples to see, so you should now where exactly you want to go. Easy to get to, usually involves a ride on the underground followed by a short bus trip or walk. Different paths laid out depending on personal fitness. Beautiful and calm."
71,5.0,"My family hiked to the peak, it is a very long and time consuming hike, it took roughly three hours for the ascent. The trails are hard on your knees and at points it can be VERY dangerous, as at the top, it is all sheer rock at a very steep pitch and you rely on holding onto a cable with your life. It is a great trip to make. I'd recommend it."
72,4.0,"Initially I plan to hike the Bukhansanseong Fortress Course.However, information from Bukhansan National Park main website is not so informative. I just follow some hikers and I ended up at Obong Course instead of my initial Bukhansanseong Fortress Course.The Obong course was more tough than I expected, hence, for those who are not prepared may like to reconsider.The view at Yeoseongbong peak and Obong peak is really superb!It make you feel on top of the world.I was a bit lost going down the mountain.Fortunately, I met my survivor, Mr Jung. He and his group of friends offer to show me the way down to the park entrance and direct me to the nearest subway.If wasn't for Mr Jung, I may take very long time to go down the mountain.It was a very great experience!"
73,5.0,"There are couple of routes to get to the top.  I suggest you ask the information center before hiking.  Being brave and adventurous I hike behind a group of hikers and went up the most advance route. That was one of my biggest regret going the wrong route,  I was not expecting it to be so hard.  I did not even stretch and boy was I sore the next day.  I literally couldn't walk up the stairs and it kind of ruin the rest of my vacation.  It's worth it but make sure to take the easy route so you can finish it quickly.  It took me a total of 6 hrs to hike up and down and a whole day resting the next day."
74,5.0,I chose the easier course however it is still quite tough for me as an amateur hiker. I took 3~4 hours to finish the course and I was met with magnificent view. Do take a walk around if you do not wish to have any strenuous exercise!
75,5.0,"If you enjoy hiking and national parks, Bukhansan is a MUST! Take the subway to ""Dobongsan"" then go west towards the main entrance. If you go on a weekend, you're sure to have a few Korean hikers to follow. I did the climb up to Jaunbong peak, which was challenging even for an experienced hiker if you take the most difficult route (including ropes, rock scrambling, etc), but there are plenty of options for varying skill levels -- easy to hard. After your hike, enjoy a meal and well earned beer or soju in the ""hiker village"" community surrounding the entrance. You can also pick up any gear you'd ever need here -- boots, poles, tents, gloves, jackets, and more."
76,5.0,"I hiked here recently on a rainy day, and despite the inclement weather, this was by far my favorite activity during my visit to Seoul.  As other reviewers have mentioned, if you plan to summit the peaks, you are in for a difficult hike.  But what they don't mention is that the lower trails are easy, and in some cases even paved, and offer some beautiful views in their own right.  I think that this free attraction, which is easily reached from downtown Seoul, is worth visiting for anyone, regardless of physical abilities, for that reason.To get here, take Subway Line #1 to Dobongsan station.  It's 18 stops, about 40 minutes, from Seoul station.  After you exit the subway station, follow the hordes of people dressed in hiking clothes through a market selling hiking gear and food to the park entrance, about a 10-15 minute walk.  There, you will find a ranger station where you can pick up a map and mark out a route depending on your hiking abilities and the amount of time you'd like to spend there.  The ranger who assisted me made a tremendous effort to help me despite a language barrier and my lack of knowledge of rain in the forecast later in the day.  His patience was immense and appreciated.  I decided to hike to Madangbawi (a large rock with some good views, it seems), which he advised was an easy hike.  The bad news: the maps available at the ranger station are not very good.  The good news: you will encounter many other hikers who can help you find your way, as I did.  The wonderful people I met on the trail hiked with me to my destination and back.  Total hiking time was about 2 hours and the views were wonderful.  I would say that it's not an easy hike, more in the moderate spectrum of difficulty.A few mostly commonsense tips: bring your own water, and don't skimp on the amount; if it will rain, bring a raincoat and an umbrella; wear sturdy shoes with good traction; wear sunscreen and sunglasses in sunny weather; and bring food with you.  Some hikers brought poles but I didn't and made it just fine."
77,5.0,"Just a stone throw away from Seoul. The main road to the base entrance is lined with hiking stores and restaurants so even if you do not have hiking gear and equipment at first, you can buy some. Excellent sceneries, multiple peaks to hike and offers varied views."
78,4.0,"I went to the main peak, but there are plenty of other trails to try. The view was amazing and the hike wasn't too difficult. It took me about 40min by subway to get to the start of the trail. Many Koreans regularly go to this place and bring food to eat at the top, so if you're lucky, you can find new friends and have a picnic together."
79,5.0,"The five main treks of Bukhansan are all doable within 5-6 hours up and down for relatively healthy trekkers. Most beautiful is Obong Trek and most dramatic is the Bukhan Fortress route. You can get off the orange line subway at Gupabal for Bukhan Fortress route and Bulgwang for Obong route. Just follow the hikers dressed for Himalayan adventures!If you wish to do all of the peaks over some days, it is easy to find jimjilbang (hot springd with sleeping rooms) near all of the entrances to the park. Cheapest and most relaxing way to soothe tired muscles after the treksCarry bottled water and snacks. Wear sensible shoes!"
80,5.0,"Walking up to this temple and back is probably the highlight of my trip to Seoul. Beautiful, serene temple, and majestic views all the way."
81,5.0,PROS: Best stop of my South Korea trip. Beautiful place. Hiked alone and enjoyed every moment. Every views were worth the snap. Baegundae Peak was beyond amazing. CONS: Long walks but you'll regret it if you're not going to put this on your itinerary in Seoul.LOCATION: 3/5PRICE: 5/5HOSPITALITY: 4/5ATTRACTIONS: 5/5
82,4.0,"Back in the day, Bukhansan was only available to people, who knew, how to get there. Nowadays, everything is arranged: Transport to get ther, being there, finding places... There are telekommunication towers blocking the view and still...It is there, you have a good view, it is very nice, if you are early, etc. Do not miss one of the best views of the City!"
83,5.0,"It is very excellent snow trekking.  I was reluctant to evaluate but many people want to go to the Mt. Seoraksan but too far so this Mt. Bukhansan is very good. Because it is inside the Seoul. You need to be well prepared: With emergency food, crampons, spats,  Trekking shoes and clothes, lunch etc. especially in the winter. :)"
84,5.0,"I did this hike on a Sunday which proved to be one of my least smart ideas. It was so so busy, the last 50meters took around 30minutes with the queue, but other than that, I thought it was awesome. The views were great and the colouring of the leaves was beautiful. The hike was more challenging than I thought it would be and I would recommend boots. I did it in my sneakers and found it very slippery in places. Very good!"
85,5.0,How to go: take the metro to Gupalan Station and boarded the bus 704/34 to the Bukhasan National Forest. Don't forget to bring water and food in case you may tried and need to refill your energy. Proper clothes and good shoes. Hiking to Bukhansan peak around 5 km. There're many Korean hikers on weekends.Suggest your guys go to hiking in Autumn. Very very beautiful view . For avoid climbing back in the dark you should come in the morning cause it's take time around 5-6 hours up there. Highly recommended escape from the city.
86,5.0,"This was one of my favorite things on my vacation to Korea. I recommend it for anyone who wants to feel like they are part of Korea and do things that the Koreans do. Like other travelers have mentioned, finding the trail was quite easy. Get off at the Dobongsan subway station and follow the herd of hikers. I went on a weekday and there were still plenty to find my way there. Be sure to stop in at the information center. The Rangers were so helpful and entertaining. They also provide a map that is in English with the major landmarks. This comes in handy to make sure you are on the right path once you head up the mountain. Shortly after setting off I was adopted by a group of hikers who I walked with most of the way to Jubong peak. The hike was of an intermediate level, not too hard (but I am a pretty regular hiker) and it was steep in some areas. After rain there could be some slippery portions so watch your step. They were not going all the way to the top but pointed me in the right direction to continue to the peak. On my way down I was adopted by another couple of hikers. They didn't speak any English like the first group but helped me find my way down and made sure that I didn't slip on all of the leaves. The views at the top were incredible and well worth the trek up. It was a bit chilly on top but felt great after the work going up. Definitely with the trip if you want to get into the natural beauty of Korea and away from the city."
87,5.0,"very nice trail, better in a clear day. back and forth with a break of 30 min on top can be done at 4.5 hour. 2 liter of water is enough + some energy snacks and fruits. transportation: Gupabal Station (Subway Line 3), Exit 1.Take Bus 704 bound for Bukhansanseong Fortress (북한산성).Get off at the Bukhansan Mountain entrance bus stop.great view from top!"
88,5.0,I went here during the week as I heard there are many people hiking at the weekend.It's very quiet and the air is way better than inside the city. You can even see some animals like squirrels butterflies and birds.Sometimes there are rocks you have to climb on ot walk over.The way is very steep at times so you need good shoes especially when climbing down again. I wore sneakers and were sliding around a lot.Also take enough water with you and something to eat as -depending with route you take- there are no places to buy stuff.It takes about 2 or 3 hours to be on the peak but the view there is simply amazing and a nice reward for the hard work climbing to the top
89,5.0,"Easily accessible by metro (+a short walk), this park is a great place to hike. Take the map at the start and use it along the way if you want to make a change from the recommended route. I suggest reaching Dobongsan peak and from there hike along the Podea ridgeline if you have time. There are some cables to use on this ridge but you can bypass it if you want (in fact there is a sign recommending tourists to take the bypass. The hike up is full of stairs and in summer it is very humid so make sure you take enough water with you (and maybe a towel because you're going to sweat a lot). There are signs on the way indicating number of kilometers from place to place. When I hiked there the view from the top was very hazy, I hope you'll get a clearer view - enjoy!"
90,5.0,"Such a great forest, easy to reach from the city center. Offers loads of hiking possibilities and mountain climbing!"
91,4.0,"I climbed the expert route and it was very tough! like i have never sweated so much in my life, but once you get to about 500m, you can get to the different peaks very easily! bring lots of water!!"
92,5.0,"I like this Mountain. You can choose many different trails, and each trail has its own beauty. Check out some traditional Korean food  while you making your way to go down."
93,5.0,"Last November 2014, my friends and I went on vacation to Seoul, Korea.  I decided I wanted to hike Bukhansan National Park because it is the most visited scenery in Seoul. I have never hiked a mountain solo, but none of my friends wanted to come with me. But that wasn't a problem at all! I learned that Dobongsan gets a lot of visitors even on weekdays so I wouldn't really be by my own self. I met a lot of people on the way up, a couple of ""ajussi"" who kept me company in the most difficult last 1 kilometer, and an ""ajumma"" from the temple who offered me kimbab and coffee and how can I forget ""abeoji"" who was really nice to drop me off at the subway station. Korean hospitality at its best! How can I forget those Korean ajummas and ajussis in their full climber outfits! I felt under-dressed! Overall, it was a very relaxing experience.  I love nature and it was the best part of my visit to Seoul."
94,5.0,Beautiful and exhilarating hiking. Quick and easy way to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
95,5.0,"If you are up for a hike and want to see some awesome views, then you really have to visit Bukhansan National Park!It was truly amazing and I didn't expect anything.As I went there solo, I would recommend you to go there with some friends, which are not frightened by heights and are brave!It was quite rough to get up there, if you have no clue at all, but it was pretty cool.Must see, when you are in Seoul ;)"
96,4.0,This mountain offers stunning views of the city and an example of Korea's beautiful nature. It's easily accessible by subway and offers a half day's worth of hiking or more.
97,4.0,Trees and plants never seen before. Beautiful colors and their shapes. Different part of world and its history.
98,5.0,"Bus 704 takes you there, the journey is around 45 minutes and gives you sights of Seoul you may not otherwise see.  The stops are given in English as well as Korean, but just get off at the Bukhasan stop, with all the other Koreans in their high - tech hiking outfits. Easy to find the main entrance from where you can take a small bus which takes you right into the park and visitors centre.  I must have looked a bit lost, in no time some friendly Koreans took me under their wing and I had a great day hiking with them to a Buddhist temple.  The walks range from very easy to strenuous and the views are breathtaking."
99,3.0,"i've heard korean usually climb mountain every weekend. it's in Seoul, so there are many people. at the top, you can see the one of metropolice city."
100,5.0,i went there in may and it was great weather. it's a beautiful escape from the city. for sure the best thing in seoul to do during the day
101,5.0,"I climbed to the top of Baegundae peak (the tallest one). It is a fairly difficult climb, similar to Angel's Landing in Utah with chains to hold on to up top. The view is great at the top. The bottom of the trail was very packed with old tourists everywhere. As soon as the trail got rough, it thinned out. (My climb was in the afternoon). You will know whether or not you can do the whole trail once it gets rocky. It is pretty steep. Would highly recommend this hike to most people. Skip this one if you are afraid of heights or aren't very quick on your feet. DEFINITELY NOT FOR SMALL CHILDREN. The sheer cliffs up top are scary, but thankfully have chains to hold on to. I am by no means a ""climber"", just a hiker and had no problems with this trail."
102,5.0,"its calming and great place to chill around. its kinda far from the seoul downtown, but its worthed to go there"
103,5.0,"This mountaineous area of Korea is spectacular. The walking trails are numerous and cater for all ability levels. The cable car is a highlight but nothing can exceed the natural beauty of the whole area.The park can get very busy on weekends and during school holidays, although the size and variety of the trails means you should always be able to find a quiet area."
104,5.0,"I did the fortress walk around Seoul and getting up the mountain and to the national park was a pain. But the views were so worth it! I didn't want to leave but had to get going to finish my walk. If you want to get the best view over Seoul, forget Namsan (but you can still go there, it's pretty), and make this place your number one must-visit item! It's better not to go on a weekend when it is less crowded. What was a tad annoying were the constant signs reminding you not to take photographs of the military stations (but they ruined the picture anyway) and I wasn't sure which places were meant until half an hour later. Anyway, totally worth it! pack good walking shoes and prepare to climb mostly stairs instead of rocks."
105,5.0,There are so many trails to hike and it's beautiful year round.  Hike on a weekend to forgo the crowds.
106,5.0,"The National Park is easily accessible by Seoul by the metro station. The location is a tranquil and scenic escape from the city. There are plenty of hiking trails and they are well maintained. At the entrance to the park, paper maps can be obtained."
107,4.0,"I was able to get out and take a short hike in the middle of winter (-1 degree and snowing) and the paths were well maintained and more helpful, well marked with distance and names in English. Fairly easy to get to via public transportation too. It was a wonderful moment and way to experience fresh air in a quiet setting just outside of the city.   I went on a Monday, so it was likely less crowded than on the weekends, from what I have read and heard."
108,5.0,"If you love scenery, a must walk to the many peaks. Can get a little challenging but the people are great around you. Hardly any English but the smiles does the job. Dont be surprised if a 70 year old Korean is zooming pass. These people are super fit and they come prepared. I think I was the only foreigner at the time but had a good time meeting great people and loving the climb up."
109,4.0,"The view from the top is awesome! The climb, though, is not your average cup of tea. If you are not physically fit, you may want to reconsider including this as part of your itinerary. Be warned!"
110,5.0,"I started the hiking from the temple Dosunsa, I went there on Saturday at 1 PM and luckily there was a parking spot the whole hiking to the Backundae peak was not too long and could enjoy all the view from the peak.For 5 hours hiking would be good for anybody who like to see the scenery of Seoul and Mountain."
111,4.0,The hike to Baegundae was tougher than expected. Climbing lots of rocks but awesome view from the top!
112,4.0,"The national park is easy to reach from a number of subway stations, so it's very conveniant to reach. I went from Gupabal station to the entrance by taxi (KRW 5000, so approx USD 5), after which I hiked to Daegunbae peak, the highest peak in the park.The path is easy to follow: well marked and you just follow the vast amount of Koreans. Paths are marked as 'beginner', 'advanced' and 'expert' levels, marked in English as well. These levels refer to the mounting percentage. I did parts of the 'Expert' with no ropes, no heavy duty equipment, etc. But the climb is quite strenuous.It was fun, the sights are beautiful, but it is really crowded. Do not expect to be alone here....."
113,5.0,There are more than 50 hiking trails just 15 minutes from the center of Seoul.  You can find trails for a half hour to all day.  Autumn season(especially mid-October) is the best.
114,5.0,"Made an impromptu visit in a walking with just a camera and a small pouch. With the summer heat, it was totally achievable in regular going out pants/shirt and sneaker. Access is a breeze. Hope on the train to Dobongsan Station and just follow the crowd. there is lots of locals walking the numerous trails. Stores selling all your hiking needs line the road leading to the park entrance. As it was an impromptu visit, took a simple trail. I guess it was too simple for the locals as it was deserted lest a few occasional elderly hikers.Spent an hour and a half walking around. I believe the place will be really beautiful in Autumn.Upon descending, food galore awaits you - pork knuckles, various seafood etc.. so if you are into eating, go in a group."
115,5.0,"One of the best experiences of my trip to Seoul. The view at the peak is really breathtaking and awe-inspiring. You'll definitely get to see most of the skyline of Seoul on a clear day from there. There are several peaks which you can get to once you're at the top and you can easily find a quiet place to sit down and rest.I did not bring proper equipment, enough water or proper hiking shoes when I went to the top. To make matters worst, it was my first time climbing and I was doing it alone. But I managed to make it to the top and down again.There were plenty of fellow hikers whom I asked for directions and help from time to time. I'd recommend to try to get to the summit with a guide or seasoned climbers, and to bring along proper equipment.If you're into climbing, this is definitely not a place to be missed in Seoul."
116,5.0,"If you are into nature, this is the place to go. There are trails available for beginner to advanced hikers, but they are all enjoyable showing off the natural beauty of the place. Also, enjoy the site of some temples that are still in use as you climb. I don't recommend this if you are traveling with young children, but the choice is yours."
117,4.0,"I used to hike up this as I lived in Seoul. It was a wonderful solo hike in Autumn and Spring. Saw some lovely lanterns and people were friendly along the hike up. If you don't have the time, don't bother. Better for longer stay trips."
118,5.0,"I visited the park in midweek so managed to avoid the big crowds, still quite a few hikers there though with brightly colored Goretex jackets.. I got off the Metro at Gupabal, took the 704 bus and got off at the Bukhansanseong stop (just past the temple, follow the hikers !). This gate has a small town, walk up through the town (base camp !) - stock up there on water etc., not much of that in the park. I hiked up to the highest peak (Baegundae), which has an exciting chained section at the top on the bare steep rock. Quite a tough hike up very rocky sections to get to there, my muscles hurt after. After that I looped back via another peak, Wonhyobong, and then back to base camp for beer and chicken ! All in all about a 3-4 hour hike and some tough steep ascending/descending, great views. Also saw some rock climbers who were able to scale some of the more dangerous looking peaks which are 'restricted areas' if you don't have the rock climbing gear."
119,5.0,"Korea is a mountainous countryIf you have time, it worth following the thousands of people hiking (but walkable and not dangerous) Korean pass time...Enjoy the real nature and beauty of Korea, minutes from downtown Seoul.  Recommend climbing up to Sunga-sa temple up Kugidong"
120,5.0,What a neat experience.  Beautiful even in the winter.  The trails are great although a little confusing.  Plenty of interesting sights along the trails.  Koreans love their hiking and this is a great place for that.
121,5.0,"Avoid the weekends but during the weekdays, it's an excellent get away for a bit of nature, sweeping view of the city and fabulous rock climbing."
122,5.0,"I went on December 2013, and fresh snow just fell. I was there hiking by myself. I got there at 2pm, which was too late to go up the peak, but I tried to hike for 2 hours. (I'm not a hiker. Just an average person with average stamina.)There was no one really hiking with me because I accidentally took the wrong trail in the forest (I can't read the korean signs and there's no English anywhere). I slipped and fell two times, which is pretty dangerous since no one's around me to help if I broke anything. Then I went on the more scenic trail , which was great. There were more people around me, and it was an easier hike. Don't get to the mountain late like I did, or else you'll miss out. You should be on the train or bus by 9am in order to get there by 10:30am. Take at least 4 hours for hiking. And make sure to bring a lot of trail mix and water. How to get there: go to the Gireum train station on line 4, and then take bus 704 (there are other buses, but I took 704)"
123,5.0,"My hike up one of the trails was well traveled with many people during the Thanksgiving Holiday week for South Koreans.  Even though the trails were crowded, the views were spectacular!  A definite must see while in South Korea!"
124,4.0,"Great hike and the temples were amazing.  take your camera and fill your backpack with water/food as the locals will stop and take breaks and enjoy a snack and water before stretching and starting out again.  mostly middle to older aged people the day I went.  everyone looked shocked to someone (American) out hiking the trails.  not for young children, the trails are well maintained, carry out what you carry in."
125,5.0,"Highly recommend this place if you have more than two days here. I was only here three full days, but made time for it. You must stop at some of the temples along the way. It was a very unique experience as I took part in meditation at the temple and met a guy who works there and explained the history. Definitely more of a hike than I anticipated, but the views were worth it. If you don't want a ton of people, do not go on the weekend (especially Sunday). On the other hand, it was interesting to see everyone (families, singles, couples, older folks) hiking...especially the neon colors and full gear like they were going to hike for days! Only about 50 minutes from the city center via metro."
126,5.0,Avoid weekends. Interesting park with an ancient wall. Close to the city centre and easy to reach. Worth to go if you like hiking
127,5.0,"it's an absolutely breathtaking experience to see such beautiful and majestic mountains right on the outskirts of the city. not just any green and boring mountain, but this one is made of huge boulders. definitely a refreshing experience to get away from the bustle of the city"
128,4.0,"There are several ways to get to this mountain; I got off at Bulgwang Station on the Orange/Brown line transfer station. If its Sunday there will be Hundreds of Korean hikers at the train station, because this is the day most Koreans go hiking.  There are lots of shops and places to eat or get coffee near the train station. There are also some gear shops and street vendors.  Then you can either walk east down Jinheung-ro (road) or take a bus the trail head, it's about a half a mile. There is a bus stop right across the street.  You will know you are in the right place when you see a park with playground equipment to the North.  You should also see some more street vendors and probably some more hikers.  If you enter the tunnel you went to far.  The trail head looks like an alley, but quickly starts going uphill.  Wear comfortable shoes that will grip the rock, like running shoes or light hikers.  Most of the way up is rock.  There are several spots to stop and take in the view and have a quick snack or lunch on the rocks. Once you hit the peak you will get some fantastic views of Seoul, on a clear day you can see Seoul tower.  Don't forget your camera on this hike.  On the way down you can take the Tangchoon trail that will put you at another trail head just on the other side of the Jinheung-ro tunnel, you can either walk back to Bulgwang Station or take the bus.  Another option is to continue on the Tangchoon trail and end up at Nokbeon Station (Orange Line).  This trail is pretty easy, and will give you some nice views on a well maintained trail.   If you are a Geocacher there are several great Geocaches along this route. I visited in the Winter of 2011, This hike should be ok to hike all year around."
129,4.0,"Bukhansan is a gem for hard core hikers like me as it was easily assessible by public transport. A good alternative to Soraksan on the eastern coast if you have not got time as a bus trip there would take you good 4-5 hrs journey.To get Bukhansan (""san"" means mountain in chinese/japanese/korean), go on the Metro and head for Suyu station (line 4), take exit 3, walk about 25 meters to bus stand in middle of road and take bus 120 to last stop (bus terminal). There is a town with many winter gears shops selling hiking clothes and accessories (i could not find any crampons for sale)From terminal, you can either wait for the shuttle bus for uphill (or walk 2km) hourney to entrance of park.There are many trails leading to various lookout points where you can see Seoul. The mountain is well sign posted with distance indicated under the sign posts but i seemed to have missed out on the Bukhansanseong fortress which is mentioned by a TA contributor below as i did not read prior about that attraction in the description or hike sign posts along the wayOverall you must have a certain level of fitness to hike up (1 to 2 hours or longer each way depending on your fitness) before you arrive at any look out point. The beautiful look out is worth the effort. Not a steep or difficult hike but as it snowed heavily I could have gone further with crampons as ice formation (black ice) made certain paths slippery.Check out my pixes on a hike at first snow (in Dec). As a hiker  this is a bonus having not to travel too far out of Seoul for a snow hike."
