0,5.0,If you go to Seoul and miss this place your trip is worthless trust me there nothing like this awesome gate and temple
1,3.0,"at the front gate, u can find some gatekeepers which i was thinking statues at first, but after two hours they change their swift and they wear traditional uniform, so can take documentation with them."
2,4.0,Large building with lots of history. Great place to visit. Be prepared to walk as the property is very large.
3,4.0,"Taking picture in front of this gate. Because it is a mandatory visit to this Palace and the gate is one of the most famous and Instagram photo ever.In the morning not so many people and good to take picture by yourself. Afternoon, usually too crowded with so many buses and tourist from all over the world."
4,4.0,This gate is lit up nicely at night. I wouldn't make the journey just for this alone but it's so close to the DDP and some pretty good shopping (also the Cheonggyechong Stream?) so make it a part of your itinerary if you will.
5,3.0,"This gate is one of several in Seoul, and located near the main palace sites. Walk down the boulevard on your way to Insa-dong or Myeong-dong nearby."
6,4.0,Experience walking through the gates before entering the palace and it will take your breathe away.Highly recommended to witness the changing of the guards at 11AM.
7,4.0,A beauftiful gate with nice traditional architecture.  Most of the time you can see the traditional Korean guards around the gate where you can take photos with.  They have at certain times a change of guards ceremony.
8,5.0,Great site to see. A long way down the boulevard prepares for the approach. And it is a not to miss site.
9,4.0,Nice place which shows you the history of the Korea like old days and really nice to visit all the time
10,4.0,Nice bid rebuilt gate.  Worth a quick stop for a look around but really not much point in spending too much time...other things to see.
11,5.0,"Beautiful entrance into Gyeongbokgung Palace. Watch the changing of the guards which happens every hour. I visited this on Saturday morning and found many young Koreans dressed in their national customs posing with tourists for photographs. If you don't wish to visit the Gyeongbokgung Palace (entrance fee of 3000 Won), you can still go inside these gates and walk inside the courtyard and take photos."
12,4.0,This is one of the original gates to the city.  It has been painfully restored after an arsonist set fire to it a few years ago.  If you are in this part of the city it is well worth the price of admission (free).
13,5.0,Driving along a main road surrounded by modern office blocks and then suddenly by the side of the road and right next to the busiest market place in the world is this beauty! Just go and take the photos!
14,5.0,"This is a very well preserved area of the city. On the day we visited, there were soldiers and priests in costume and a procession throughout the entrance to the palace."
