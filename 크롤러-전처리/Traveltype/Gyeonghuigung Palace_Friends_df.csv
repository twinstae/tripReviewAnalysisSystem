Queen residence has its tragic story with beautiful architecture. Main throne hall is best picture spot with background of mountain. Tourists who dress in Hanbok are exempted for admission fee. It closes on Tuesday."

2,5.0,"Why husband and I arrived just after 10 on a Sunday and found the Palace was completely empty, we had the most magical time wondering around on our own, it was quiet, sunny and we got some beautiful photos. The palace is so beautifully kept, the painting is still pristine or renovated so well which ever the case. Right next door to the Seoul Museum of History and the Art museum so fitting it all into one day would be easy. Line 5 (purple) to Seodaemun exit 4"

The colors of their uniforms are bright and beautiful. They are tall and march with dignity. It is very hot in Seoul in the summer so a good hat with a brim and ir an umbrella s helpful."
