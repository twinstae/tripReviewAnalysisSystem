0,5.0,Definitely well worth a visit. Affordable entrance fees and there is a schedule for english guide tour. Spent 2 hours there and easily accessible on foot from nearest subway.
1,4.0,"It is early winter and the air is fresh and cold. We walked from our hotel upThe track and down to this village. I can imagine how beautiful it will be when in spring. But many local still walk here, business Executives that walked after their finished their lunch. Senior folks that that stroll and the in full sports gear. Nice place to visit."
2,5.0,"We visited yesterday, 20/07/19, a family of 6 aged between 6 - 69. No entrance fee that we noticed. Information hut was on your immediate right after entry. Lovely clean toilets all the way round the area.  This trip was throughly enjoyed by all. It was a nice steady walk around the village and gardens. Fun games for the children to take part in as you walk, including a stamp collecting map for the children to find stamps as they walk around. Lovely village and So clean and well taken care of.  Some very large Koi fish in the lake which the children enjoyed watching. We could have hired traditional dress at the entrance but with the humid heat we would have struggled. I would happily go again for a lovely peaceful stroll."
3,4.0,"It’s very close to our hotel. Its a good place to visit, cultural heritage with traditional houses. Fresh atmosphere. It’s free access. Also its not so many people like other tourist attractions, so i like it."
4,5.0,"This place is a hidden jewel if you experience some of the traditional Korean culture. The park itself is peaceful and very walkable. One must try “Experience Korea” items at a nominal fee such as making  bow and arrows, making crafts, making game pieces, rice cakes, etc. The instructors are people who are experts at these Korean traditions and passionate about sharing them."
5,4.0,Just take a short walk from Chungmuro station and you will reach this village. Admission is free. We walked around the few traditional houses and the pond nearby. It is small but peaceful and not crowded. A great place for a stroll and photos.
6,4.0,"Hanok cluster, folk game zone, pavilions, ponds, time capsule square, etc.It's a great place to spend 2~3 hours.The location is really good as well. 3 min walk from Metro #3, #4 Chungmuro Station. Near the metro station, there's a bus to N Seoul Tower, too."
7,4.0,i was taken to this village as a tour package and found it quite interesting place to explore korean traditional culture. it is a recreated village by the government to preserve Korean traditional for the people. nice visit.
8,5.0,"This place is conveniently located right in the heart of the city and worth visiting. Unlike Bukchon Hanok Village where you could only admire the houses from the outside, here you can actually get inside and walk around the houses. We were there on Sunday and there was a real traditional Korean wedding hosted so we got to observe the beautiful ceremony as well as the venue. Inside, there were few activities for kids to do too. While our daughter got dressed in Hanbok dress (10,000 won for one hour), our son enjoyed making a wooden bow and arrows. There were also craft and tae kwon do show in the afternoon. All in all, it was a very nice place to visit."
9,3.0,"If you don't want to paid for korean folk village and still want to enjoy some Korean history village, then can have a short trip here. Nothing much compare as this is free. Please come on weekend as more activity else it just a <1 hour trip. There is a free guide offering if you interested."
10,4.0,Went here the 2nd time with my family. There's no entrance fee as well and you can pretty roam around the whole area and take good photos. If you're more into learning the history and culture in Korea. You should go here.
11,4.0,"Very nice area with traditional Korean houses.  The houses are well maintained and decorated.  Nice garden yard area, which is very peaceful.  Pleasant place to walk and spend a casual afternoon"
12,5.0,"The scenery is amazing. My favourite part was the pond in the back with swimming fish, where i could sit down and meditate. We even saw a cat running across a bridge."
13,4.0,"If you like quiet and peaceful strolls whilst enjoying a good view, the NamSanGol Hanok Village is for you. There's not much going on here besides looking at traditional Korean homes (aristocratic) but the walk and sightseeing is quite quaint and serene.But in all honesty, this place can easily be a hit or miss. I went to the Korean Folk Village a few days before I came here so I didn't enjoy this scenery much (even though it's just as beautiful here). So be sure to plan out which village scenes you attend first before going to several. One is usually enough, there's not much difference for two visits. I recommend the Korean Folk Village more."
14,5.0,"5 mins walk from Chungmuro subway station (exit 4). Free admission but closed on Tuesday. Namsangol Hanok display Hanok (traditional Korean house) from several wealthy family. Personally I prefer Namsangol Hanok compared to Bukchon Hanok because there are many activities in this place which opens to public, flatter walking path and we can ""peep"" the internal hanok."
15,5.0,"I thought this place was perfect for taking a walk. It was very quiet and peaceful when I was there. The hanoks are fun to see, but there aren't very many of them. It's free, so it's great to check out if you're in the area."
16,5.0,Enjoyed every side of it since we went there during spring. lots of flowers and cherry blossoms. there are also people and couples in hanbok who are also game to take picture with. good for family bonding too as we see lots of them having a picnic
17,5.0,"My take is this is a better bet for seeing Hanoks because Bukchon is a upperclass residential district set on a hill (people still live there, so you can't just walk in!)  In Namsangol, it is a reconstructed village (mostly of old houses that were moved there, and 1 replica), so you can walk around all you like - the other nice part is that it is near Myeongdong (Chungmuro), so easily accessible, and not hilly (unlike Bukchon!)"
18,5.0,This is one place that i would highly recommend when you visit Seoul. Its like traveling back in time. Its very fascinating to see how Koreans lived during those Joseon/Shilla era and how they built the houses with those intricated designs. There's no entrance fee and you can ask for a guided tour as well free of charge. They also provide wheelchairs for seniors who cant walk too long which  was really great since im traveling with 2 senior citizens.
19,4.0,"It was fun and crowded with Korean to celebrate the mid autumn festival. Great experience, there was shows for the whole day, stalls for younger to participate in crafts, Korean families were picnicking, and food trucks selling Korean food.  The houses were in good shapes with lots of interior details and we were able to understand how Korean lived before..my boys were learning and asking what were this, why and how. Overall it was great cultural experience to learn."
20,4.0,"Bring your camera because you are going back in time. The houses were replicate of old Korean houses. There are some demonstration of Korean craft. Hanbok experience is also available but it's not free. What I like most is the Taekwondo performance at 1pm. There was a booth outside the village which indicates ""free tour for foreigners"". I waited there, but nobody came to give tour, what a pity. I hope there can be more interactive activities in the village."
21,3.0,This is a nice little replica of a traditional Korean Village but not something I would say is a must see. It would be better if there was more information about what you are seeing.
22,4.0,"We get there using Subway Line 4 and gett off from Changmuro Station Exit 3. We ask somebody here about the direction and here we are...we enter the gate of Namsangol Hanok Village.You can get brochure and card stamped beside the Tourist Information.we enjoy watching the buildings and park. we can sit and enjoy the ponds to relax or walking to the park.After enter the gate, you will get the ball with huge open building. this place is for meeting all the people who lives in this village. Beside the building there.s a bunch of traditional house of Korea.you can buy a ticket to learn Hangeul, or learn how to make the Korean traditional game, or how to make Hanbok, etc.You can walk around to see clearly from close the part of the house, such as living room, kitchen, bedroom, study room, work room, praying room, etc. you can see the pict i send.for me it's interesting one and grateful i found this awesome place."
23,4.0,"The buildings were beautiful and so were the surroundings.   It's not a large area to visit, but I liked that it was not crowded and it was very enjoyable walking through the area.    My sister, niece, and I rented hanbok from the rental place right outside.   It was more expensive than the rental inside the village, but the hanbok were beautiful and the husband and wife running it were very nice.   The woman even did our hair for us.   I'm a korean drama fan so it was so fun - I felt like a character in a historical drama.  Lol."
24,5.0,"The park was well situated right at the heart of the city.  It was walking distance from our apartment.  It gave us a taste of Korean culture.  We were able to take lots of picture-perfect shots!  What's more, no entrance fees and you can stroll around the park at your own sweet time."
25,4.0,"This Hanok Village is well worth a visit and has more to see than we had expected.  There is no entrance fee and you can spent a pleasant hour or two in the park and viewing the traditional houses.  There was live music when we visited on a Sunday afternoon and many families were out enjoying the atmosphere.  This is at the foot of Namsan, so combines well with a walk up to the North Seoul Tower."
26,5.0,Well-kept memoir of Korean history. Very accessible -- through Chungmoro subway. Different versions of Hanok houses --- with cultural shows. The park is nice and clean.There is a tea house --- where you could try the traditional tea ceremony. Souveneir shop have nice and reasonably-prices mementos. Free entrance. Overall nice experience.Recommended to all tourist who are staying near Myeongdong area (less than a kilometer walk from Myeongdong Entrance).
27,4.0,"I missed this place in my last 2 visits to Korea..there are so much more to see , new places, new attractions, changes to keep tourists come back for new discoveries"
28,5.0,"Traditional House Of Korea, good place to go and take a picture and Cherry Blossom. Big Enough and very beautiful place."
29,5.0,"Traditional architecture and living habits of old Koreans are the things you will find here. Admission is free. Located near to the Chungmuro exit. It is very scenic. Overall, worth a visit."
30,4.0,"Very close to chungmuro station. Get out exit 3, don't go up the slope, walk straight past the petrol kiosk, follow the sign and you're there in 3 min. Nice environment and atmosphere. They moved some actual hanok onto this site. So they are not really new replicas. We went during the lunar new year festivities period and they had a lot of traditional crafts, activities and shows. Quite fun! But too cold as it was snowing hard. Fun place for kids to run around too. There's also a park at the back to explore if your interested. A nice walk around the village and feel lost in time. Transported to a different age. A gentle walking course for both young and old."
31,5.0,really great place to feel korean traditional cultureit's close from my hotel good accessibility.
32,5.0,"A good place to spend your time and see how an old Korean village look like. Admission is free and right in the city. Highly recommended for tourists who want to take photographs of Korean houses, the urns used to make kimchi, and lifestyle."
33,4.0,"It's a nice place to explore the culture and history. Probably take 1 hour to walk around and there's no admission fee. You can rent hanbok outside the village for 20,000₩ for 1 hour."
34,5.0,1) The place has no entrance fee. It is definitely free.2) Has a number of Korean traditional houses and the breathtaking view o f its garden.3) Visitor can see the Time Capsule which will be opened on 29nov2394
35,5.0,"We went there in group like 15 people, we rent hanbok just ouside the Hanok Village. It costs us $20 for one person. And we walk inside the village with hanbok. Interior feels like you are back to old centuries. Its free admission."
36,4.0,"After our lunch as part of our full day city tour, we dropped by here for a visit. Well, some may feel that this place is a ""me too"" replica from other Hanok Villages but we feel it has its unique offering and still worthwhile for a visit to experience different time.Other than some of the old and traditional houses and buildings (but no one is living here), what this place offered was a massive garden that is so serene and tranquil. Upon entering and after a short walk, you will see a lovely pond with lots of fishes (i.e. Koi) swimming and birds flying around in a greenery and nature environment. Walking further, you will come by a section where fruit trees and vegetables are grown.Walking further in, there is an open field where the operator placed traditional Korean games here and visitors could grab one up and play, to enjoy the past time activity. What is interesting is the place where the Time Capsule that was buried here in 1994 to mark Seoul’s 600 Year Anniversary and is scheduled to be reopened in 2394!!! On top of it was the inscribed well wishes by well known political leaders and celebrities around the world.There is also a section where the theatre and tea house is located (next to each other). Unfortunately we didn't make it on time for the performance but did dropby for some tea. It was good!It was a good visit here despite the fact that the weather was sunny and warm. Do if you plan to come here, do remember to bring along an umbrella, hat and drinking water. Also recommended to put on a pair of comfortable or sport shoes as there are lots of walking to be done to be able to enjoy the scenic view of the nature!The washrooms/souvenir shop are located near the main entrance on the right. In fact, right here, the national flower of Korea, the Rose of Sharon could be seen, very nice. There are also static photo standee here of characters wearing ancient Korea costumes.Admission is free. Highly recommended."
37,5.0,This was not here when we last visited in 1996.  We loved walking through the village and the garden paths and coming across the lovely little water falls.  Thoroughly enjoyed!
38,3.0,"It is nice to visit if you do not know anything about Korea, but it is not a real old village. They just rebuilt houses in the style of different Korean eras. Too crowded during national holidays, but they normally organize activities for kids (so it is a good place to go for them)."
39,4.0,Namsangol Hanok Village was nice place .Good for visiting and relaxing .A lot local people visiting ...
40,5.0,"I was surprised on the day we went to visit Namsangol Hanok Village.  It was not so crowded and everything was so well maintenance.  There was a taekwondo show in a middle of the day, it was awesome!"
41,5.0,"The village is free.  The area is clean and concentrate.  The traditional houses are kept nice.  Most importantly, it's free with a lot of optional fee-charged activities at your choice."
42,5.0,"This peaceful village is a wonderful spot to encounter traditional Korean culture. It features 5 different yangban (upper class) houses from Joseon era, all relocated here from different part of Seoul."
43,3.0,"Namsangol Hanok Village was traditional Korean houses that were rebuilt at the foot of Namsan mountain mainly for tourism.  Inside the village, different types of houses with different interior designs indicated the life style of different classes in the old times.  Lot of tourists rent Korean Hanbok from the shops there for taking pictures. It was more like a park than a historic site.To get there, take the subway to Chungmuro Station Exit 3 and look for a gas station, then you will find the road to the Village. Entrance fee was waived on the day of our visit."
44,4.0,My family and I visited the village on 2nd July 2016 and was fortunate to witness a real wedding being conducted there. There are shows being conducted to acquaint the visitors on the various aspects of Korean culture. However beside the village was a huge park with waterfalls and an area dedicated to a time capsule being laid at the bottom of a tunnel. Just be prepared to do do a lot of walking up and down. Entrance is free.
45,2.0,"We went to this place with special interest as we wanted to see typical korean village. it was located in a hill but hardly any village types houses seen. All areas are commercialised with shops and restaurants. One house is converted into rural museum and after paying huge amount for entry, we did not get to see much of rural korea."
46,4.0,stroll and catch a glimpse into the old traditional village. nearby good find - kimbap store right at the entrance.
47,5.0,"The historical buildings are set in a spacious and beautifully landscaped park. It can be accessed easily from Chungmuru subway station and entrance is free! I was there in the morning and it was not crowded at all. A really good way to start off the day before facing the crowds at other tourist attractions. I was able to admire the scenery and take pictures with no one at the background. My family took a tea appreciation experience workshop at the Hanok. It cost 4000 Won per person and it was a fun experience learning how to make tea with our pretty and gentle 'teacher'. We were served little snacks to go with our tea and we could take pictures inside the room with olden Korean decoration. There are other 'experiences' that you can take part in and they are generally not expensive.  If you have no time to visit  Korean Folk Village or Bukchon Hanok, take some time to visit Namsangol Hanok Village since it has a little of what both places have to offer. It is situated between Myeongdong and Dongdaemum and would be refreshing for the tired shoppers. We had a relaxing time just walking around the place and being away from the crowd."
48,3.0,A small part of retained village for tourists to see how koreans lived in village. Big spread. would have been useful if free guide is provided.
49,4.0,"very nice place, we walked there wearing hanbok clothes..very nice to take a picture and see how they lived years ago"
50,5.0,"We decided to stay at one of the local Hanoks for a night just to experience it. The kids loved it,  as did we, but the hard floor and thin mattresses an acquired taste for westerners! The traditional breakfast is a must, as is a wander around the entire are. The narrow streets are very atmospheric, very clean  and tidy, and we felt safe at all times. Definitely worth a visit"
51,4.0,"I am not sure how authentic the village is (it is a model, there are no residents), but for a visitor it provides a useful sample of old Korean buildings. There are several activities throughout the day and the information was very good."
52,4.0,"Located in the middle of the city, close to myeong dong area, i found this place accidentally when i just back from myeong dong shopping area...Very nice and not to crowded, free entry when u come in the morning..."
53,2.0,"The Namsangol Hanok village features a few old (1880's) houses that have been reassembled on the site featuring jointed woodwork, hypocaust style heating and some typical furniture. The environment is one of concrete surfaces and a dried up stream - not very rural or green at all. The site also features the so called time-capsule buried in 1994 and due to be opened in 600 years time.  Our future ancestors may struggle to 'read' the CD and DVD buried deep in the earth...but it won't be our concern!We took the one hour free guided tour but although the volunteer guide was lovely, with good English and clearly a genuine interest in the site....it was all a bit boring actually!  Sorry to be so negative....but this place did little for me!"
54,4.0,"The village is very quite and nice.I have experience in take picture with hanbok.The name of hanbok studio is Ariang, just the right side of village. You can rent the hanbok for 01 hour, the fee is 20.000wonOr you can take picture in the studio (they will photoshop for you and print 03 pictures) with the fee is 10000won/person.It is very nice and tradiontional."
55,3.0,"Really let down by this place, my kids (6 & 8) were of the age where one could get on all the rides and the other couldn't, all the rides for the younger one was really baby'ish. The place is generally very tired"
56,5.0,Two things you must do here 1. Rent hanbok to wear for photo taking (so pretty!)2. Go to the tea house in the village and have a nice cool quencher in summer
57,5.0,It was snowing and we immediately made our way here. It's so conveniently located near the station. Snow covered all trees n pavement.  You would not believe this place is right in a city. It's beautiful and we were do engrossed in snow activities and picture taking that we forgot about the indoor tour around the house. There is this nice little eatery near the entrance that supposedly serve 'ugly but tasty gimbap'...We were too full to add that in our order but we saw that it was popular.  Loved it!
58,5.0,"This is a place everyone must go if you are in Seoul, you can see unique buildings and lots for shoppers. Enjoy the olden days of Seoul here."
59,4.0,"Village may not the the biggest or the most authentic one, but it is located near Mt. Namsan and you can have a nice walk to Namsan Cable Car Station and to NTower, so it is good to put these attractions together if you are in the area.You can't go inside buildings, but it gives you some idea how such traditional houses looked like."
60,3.0,"After visiting a lof of other Korean folk villages and the palace, I think this artificial Hanok village is a little bit boring."
61,4.0,"Alhough smaller and kinda replica compare to Bukchon, this small museum village is interesting to learn the way the korean lived. The village range from low to mid level living quarter. Recomended for kids, but dont forget also to visit the Bukchon version."
62,5.0,"We went here from Namsan park, because our guesthouse was at the back of this village. All the scenery was beautiful. When we came, there was no event here, due to winter time. But our kids had so much fun to look around. I recommended this place for family, with young kids, who want to see hanok and inside the hanok. It is easy to walk here. And it's free."
63,4.0,It covers quite a large area. Quite a number of interesting buildings and antique things to look at. An open area for traditional games. A good view of N Seoul Tower too. Easy access by public transport.
64,4.0,"It's a great place to stroll around in, experience and feel traditional Korean culture. The place is quiet even with a lot of people milling about."
65,3.0,"Overall good experience. There were quite a lot of people- especially families with children. Only a few food stalls mostly selling traditional rice cakes, hotteok etc.They also have a special event schedule for the day with some traditional dancing and other performances."
66,4.0,"It is conveniently located, not far from Chungmuro station (line 4) exit 4. Free admission and you can get to experience a traditional Korean village there more leisurely than bukchon hanok village, which involves a lot of tough walking.The hanbok experience and arrow making class (fee applies) are the highlights of the visit. The hanbok there are new & beautiful and you are allowed to take photos inside a traditional Korean house, which is great in my opinion."
67,4.0,"I'm glad I found this little gem on the way to the train station. There was also a photo studio where you can dress up with traditional clothes, get your photo taken and even walk around around the village! It was pretty cool. Overall, I still consider this a little treasure."
68,4.0,"Me and my wife was looking around Myeongdong and just decided to walk....well we walk pretty far and then we found the village. It was great seeing how my ancestors lived many years ago. The design of the building was very nice as well. I find it hard to believe Koreans were so short back in those days. The houses were pretty small in height and my wife's head touched the bottom of a doorway, and she is 63"". If you keep walking towards the rear of the village you will stumble across the time capsule. I also played a game of tuho and out of everybody that played, I was the only one to get my dart into the small hole. You have to try it, pretty sure it would make an ""excellent"" drinking game as well lol."
69,5.0,It is great to combine this village with the Gyeongbokgung palace at the same day. It is easy to compare daily life of  royalty and normal citizens of Korea. It also has a time capsule to celebrate Seoul 600th anniversary.
70,5.0,"With the help of a korean friend, now we understand how they used to live, the traditional way of celebrating theirs ancestors and the day by day.It was nice place to be and spend no more than 2 hr there, the kids loved it because it was not a long walk."
71,4.0,"I have been to this place just by pure luck when we were wandering around with my mum. Sadly it was lunch time and that's why most of the workshops were on break but still it was good enough to make us happy with its nature and well designed structure. We bought many items from the gift shop inside. It is not the cheapest but definitely normal prices; if you find something you like, definitely go for it."
72,4.0,"The Namsangol village is a reconstitution of what a traditional Korean village was during the Joseon dinasty. As a reconstitution it feels a bit like a tourist attraction (it certainly is), rather than an actual historically relevant and authentic place. Nethertheless, the village is very interesting. It is free, big enough to stroll around for 2 hours or so, and allows visitor to discover the different buildings and rooms comprised in a Korean home and village. The place is very-well maintained, and doesn't feel dated at all. What's also great about the village isn't the village itself but the background and the surrounding environment. Located at the foot of Namsan mountain, the village is allows for stunning views of the mountain as well as the Jongro skyline. In and around the village, the park is also very relaxing: patches of grass, river streams, trees, pagodas, pools, combined with the actual village, make the place truly worth seeing. Lying around for 30 minutes or so in the park is actually probably the best thing you could do in the park, as it is truly relaxing."
73,4.0,Visited this hanok village with my mother. Beautiful traditional hanok houses and lovelyb cherry blossom trees here really makes our trip here meaningful. You can try the traditional hanbok clothes and take pictures with the standees.
74,5.0,"This is a traditional korean village created in the middle of Seoul's skyscrapers.  Admission is free.  You get the sense of how a typical family (nobleman, craftsman,...) lived in these compounds as they are furnished and maintained in excellent condition.  In addition, they offer demonstrations of traditional arts (basket weaving, calligraphy, trying traditional dress, martial arts).  It's also very calm and peaceful with many trees and areas to sit.  At the top of the hill, there is building with a millennial time capsule which will be opened in another 400 or so years."
75,4.0,"To get here ,get off at chungmuro subway station exit 4 . Do not go straight look behind you and there is a gas station and you will a small street between 2 buildings ,walk through there and you will immediately see the entrance.  The village is a reminder of korean tradition. We went there on a sunday and there many people watching a program. The village is clean and well kept. Some cherry blossoms were already in bloom. It is a small place and will only take less than an hour to explore."
76,5.0,"Last Friday I went to Hanok village with my family it was a great attraction to visit. I got to the attraction by taxi it was about a 15-minute drive to get there. The first thing I knew when I saw the place it was a wonderful place to go in fall, the first thing I did when I got there was I went to a mini-museum of the ‘olden’ Korea. It wasn’t that crowded so it wasn’t hard to find the next place to see. All the houses were Korean styled with the curve on the top. There was also a lemonade booth where I bought a drink to drink. About lunch time was when lots of people came so I recommend coming early about 11 or 10. I stayed there for about 2 hours. There was a show too it was very entertaining. The funniest that happened was when my son stepped into someone else's house. The most important thing you should bring for the visit is a good quality camera. In the area, there were lots of restaurants so there was a variety of food you could eat. I think the attraction was probably the highlight of my stay in Korea."
77,4.0,"This place would be beautiful in the spring, summer or fall. Our winter visit wasn't as scenic but we didn't have any crowds either."
78,4.0,"It is little village, free of charge. So, why not pay a visit while you are in Seoul?  My family came here early in the morning of Nov. 8, 2014 not much people yet at the area. But later during the day, the place became crowdy as tourists came in groups. We have seen typical and traditional houses of Korea of olden age with their antique items to show. We spent most of our times strolling around the village and taking pictures of ourselves by those ancient buildings which I believe are replicas of an ancient Korean village or ""hanok"". Besides, it was Fall and we experience to be under those trees with colorful leaves, enjoying the beauty of nature. What a place to remember in my solitary moments."
79,3.0,"We visited Namsan Hanok Village on November 2014. Tourists are welcomed with free enter. We were here during morning time, not many tourists. After 12pm the more and more people are coming in. The village is huge,lots of open space. There will be traditional culture performance on Sunday 3pm. However we missed it because we came on Saturday. We saw a wedding ceremony are held at one of the Hanok house, really special. There is a park at the backyard, suitable for strolling while enjoy the scene."
80,3.0,"Nothings much here, just taking photos of the traditional building, houses.... Also can pay and try on traditional things..."
81,5.0,"This is a must do when we have visitors in town. Free traditional homes to view, walk around beautiful park with a time capsule. Very neat. They have traditional hoop and stick as well as another game to try for kids. It is a close walk to shopping markets after with plenty of street food and shopping. Great, inexpensive cultural day."
82,3.0,It is an interesting place to know more about the old Korean village.But there are few empty spaces inside the building which is useless.
83,3.0,"Here there is a Tourist Information that we discovered that they have Hanbok for rentals and take a photo shoot inside. People there are very accommodating but just be careful of pulling and choosing Hanbok because some of them smells bad though if you want to try Hanbok, tourist centers in the Airport are giving out a try for free."
84,4.0,This village showcases traditional Korean villages. There are a lot of well preserved hanoks (korean houses). We were able to try on Hanboks and have our pictures taken. Take Line 4 & get off at Chungmuro Station.
85,4.0,This was a fun little spot to take the kids. The walking paths led us up to a great view of Seoul Tower. The main area has a stage and place where tents are set up for local craftsmen. You can try out the traditional games and they do performances and ceremonies on a schedule.The traditional hanok (houses) were open for viewing but you can't go inside them. Lots of opportunities for photos though. And best of all it is completely free!
86,4.0,"We visited the day of Lunar New Year so it was busy, but had a lot of activities.  We got to try traditional rice cake soup a Korean New Year's tradition.  There we lots of arts and crafts for the kids to enjoy.  They also had performances.  I don't think the food, arts/crafts, and performances are normal, but a Lunar New Year event.  They might do other events on regular days, but you will need to check.  The village display was nice with multiple houses.  There was no fee.  It is easy to get to and see if in Seoul.  If you would like to see a village or traditional houses without leaving the city this is a good choice.  Ramps were available, but it was slightly muddy due to weather.  It is also on the slope of Namsan Mountain."

As other reviewers have said, it is completely free to visit this hanok village, but we were surprised to have a student tour guide take us around the village.  Stella, our 15 year old tour guide, spoke very good English and taught us so much more about what life was like in Korea in the early 1900's than what we would have picked up on if we walked through the village without her.  We spent around an hour there walking through the houses and playing a few games."

With the guide walking through the Hanok houses and explaining how the folks lived in the olden days was really interesting.  The story of each house was also explained and we get to see the houses in a different light.  Would highly recommend this place and also engaging the guide.  There is no entrace fee and the guide's service is free too.  The place is great for photo-taking."

There is no charge to enter, just charges on the activities you may want to join in on. It's a perfect place for a shutterbug or anyone with small children that want to run around the massive park. It sits just below the iconic Seoul Tower."

93,5.0,"This place gives a very good introduction to Korea - their place, culture, heritage, etc. We paid for the traditional costume here (I can't remember exactly how much) but it is cheaper than a few other places that offers the same service. There is also a huge park located in there, we didn't explore it fully though. Too much walking."
94,4.0,"A good calming place to enjoy the scenery, and what the Korean culture has to offer. An area full with old traditional well-maintained Hanok (Traditional Korean houses), parks & etc.. Great ambience to have a nice stroll accompanied by the faintest music at the background that is broadcast through the entire village. A great place to relax and be away from the typical hustle & bustle of the city. To top it off, it's entirely free!"
95,4.0,"this is a good place to enjoy Korean culture. Nice parks with lots of greeneries, small fountains, ponds, etc, enjoyable for walking and get your children running around freely. Saw families with you children bringing their bikes to the ambience was really relaxing and did not feel ""touristy"" at all. Too bad no dining options here so you need to go out to nearby Myeongdong area to get choices of food."

I watch Kdramas and as I walked through the alleys of the village, I somehow felt as if I was part of those dramas.  In our pics, you can see the traditional houses amidst towering buildings surrounding the village and it was magnificent.  There were kids performing so that was a bonus.  The landscaping in the village is totally refreshing"

There were workers carving ice sculpture.  My children had a good time walking around the premise and playing with 2 traditional games - 'tuho'(arrow throwing) and Korean spinning top.  There is a photo studio located outside the Hanok village that has hanbok (tradition costumes) for rental at 15,000 won for 1 hour and photo shoot at 20,000 won (for 2 pieces of 6x8 photo).  Seems like a good idea to rent the hanbok for photo-taking around the village.  Unfortunately, the weather was just too cold, so we took photos at the studio instead.  The photo studio is Arirang Studio, located at 2nd floor of the building just outside Namsangol hanok village."

Since we are moving around in Seoul by the subways, this is the nearest traditional village to the Chungmuro station. It's very easy to get there.There's no need for entrance fee but a very minimal charge for the 'Hanbok' and some other activities if you want to join or try out. This is what I really want! To put on the 'Hanbok'. But Koreans are small in size..so only few pieces (no choice of colors) to pick for an L -XL sizes. Price is only KRW3000 per person per dress. We spend sometime walking around the village while admiring the architecture of the traditional houses. Many kindergartens children around with their teachers joining the activities held. A pleasant stroll in picturesque surroundings completes our visit here."
