The mountain is not high. Very short climbing. There's a pavilion on top as an observatory.- Rare rocky mountain. It's also nice to see from the ground.- Popular for the nightscape.- People also do rock climbing here."

Then there it was through the trees, the view of the city with lights emerged.  On top of the hill there is a pavilion with a deck and exercise equipments.   We can see Han river and Seoul Forest.  It was definitely the highlight of the trip."
