0,5.0,"This was a free museum located off the main parade grounds of Gyeongbokgung Palace.  We toured the Palace and grounds first, watched the changing of the guards ceremony before heading indoors to tour this museum.  Inside there were three floors of history that covered practically all aspects of royal life, from birth until death, for the Joseon dynasty.  The following stood out for us:-The display on royal processions was quite impressive as it explained the size and significance of the various groups of people who were required to escort the king during a formal outing.  -The scientific accomplishments and capabilties including a water clock but unfortunately for us was going through maintenance during our visit. I thought the displays and their explanations was very well put together and held the interest of the whole family.  Compared to the crowds attending the changing of the guards ceremony it felt like we had the museum to ourself."
1,5.0,We were surprised to see that this museum was free to visit. It contains a great deal of Korean history and culture. It also offers free Wifi for visitors and proved a godsend on a scorching day after doing the palaces.

3,3.0,"Although I have a great appreciation for museums of the world, I did not find this one particularly stunning. In fact, it was quite boring. Sparse highlights included a mural depicting the extent of the original palace grounds, the artifacts in section 5 on the 1st floor (1F), and the water clock in the basement. That was about it for me.English tours are given daily at 11:00 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. on the ground floor (which is actually level 2, or 2F in Asian countries). But the tours had apparently been cancelled the day we arrived, so we were given complimentary headsets with English descriptions instead. Unless you have nothing to do, I might just skip this altogether."

It displays records, paintings, royal clothes, state rites and other stuffs from royal families.  It is very fortunate for me to visit this as i have been an avid fan of watching historical dramas and the fee was free.  I was amazed how the intricate details of every artifact from seals, costumes, palanquins, paintings were preserved.  The museum was divided into different states of the dynasty from Architecture, science, royal childbirth, royal life up to the last Korean empire.  This is a must visit to fully understand and appreciate the Korean history."
5,2.0,We visited gyeonbukgung palace and stopped in the cafe  here for a quick coffee. It's cozy & comfy inside but it took ages to make the coffee and it was luke warm when we finally got it. I wouldn't recommend it.
6,5.0,"Conveniently linked to the subway, this should be your first stop before visiting the palace to gain a better understanding of the history of the place. It is bigger than it looks and has lots of exhibit over 3 floors.We covered less than 2 floors after more than an hour and had to proceed to the palace as my toddler was getting bored and restless.It is free, making it a must-visit if you intend to visit the palace, or if you are short on time and deciding to skip the palace grounds."
7,4.0,The museum is located in and not far away from the city. The building is nice and many palace's stuffs here
8,4.0,"If you enjoy palaces, history and architecture, this is a place for you! The exhibits explain how the palaces were built, the architecture styles, techniques and ideas. Also displays with palace life, etiquettes and practices. Quite interesting. I enjoyed looking at the displays but alas, the descriptions were mostly in Korean. There is some English explanation but mainly summary or just a title. I wish there's more explanation in English so I could understand I more detail. Possibly not fun for younger kids who won't appreciate the exhibitions as they are not very interactive."
9,5.0,"Beautifully laid out in spacious halls, the history of the 500 years of Joseon rule is well featured here. Free admission, located just next to the main entrance to Gyeongbukgung, there is little to discourage anyone to visit. Worth the 0.5 to 1 hour visit together with the palace visit."
