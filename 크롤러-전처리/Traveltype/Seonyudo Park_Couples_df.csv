0,4.0,"A Maze Runner-esque park set on an island that must be one of the most vast and tranquil open space in Seoul. The island is connected to the mainland by a bridge that you can cross, though it might not be for the faint-hearted. There's a glasshouse and some other facilities  (a museum probably?) that you can visit and also a cafe and a restaurant that offer an amazing view on the flowing river. There are gazebos scattered all over where you can take a rest and soak in the view. It's beautiful to visit at summertime and in autumn I imagine, however, seeing the park in late October was quite disappointing. The flora is dried up and it's overall pretty gray so I recommend visiting either in spring or summertime, there's a lot to discover if you're going for the first time!"
1,5.0,"This is a lovely and well kept park, as most big parks in Soul. It is not just a park though, there are lots to see. There are pianos that you can play and a glass house with cactuses. The route to the park has great views too."
