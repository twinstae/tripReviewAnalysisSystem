0,1.0,"avoid at all cost... rude sellers, overpriced goods .. sellers at the basement 1 and 2 are very rude to tourists .. one shop even looked at us from head to foot and told us rudely that they cannot sell to us, ""Do not touch original""... i was just asking the price of the item on display even though the item covered in plastic (glad wrap)... he took the shoe from my hand that what was on display ( a very good valentino open top rock stud sneakers for men knock off)... sellers will first google the price of the LEGIT item before telling you their price... PASS on this mall... cheaper to buy in europe for Legit items that are on sale than deal with RUDE Migliore knock off sellers!!..... imho sellers in so called ""silk markets"" in mainland China are nicer to deal with..."

The store was packed with visitors and the space inside it was pretty tight so not a particularly enjoyable experience. However, visitors can find all kinds of clothing for both adults and children as well as lots of accessories.My advice is to only visit this place if you really want to find cheap clothes and accessories and have the time to spare, but please do not bring children here as it is too crowded and very hectic. The aisles are narrow and people are always pushing their way past you."

3,1.0,"super bad experience here. sellers were super rude and unfriendly. this place is also filled with youngsters that are rude. i went to one of the shop and was browsing at the dresses and i was holding onto one that caught my eye. i took less than five minutes and then the seller snatched the dress away from me and asked if i wanted it so i replied that i still want to look around. she then began to mumble and say that i kept saying i want to look look look. hence, i decided to put the dress back and walk off with my sister. NEVER DID I EXPECT THAT she actually chased us and tapped on my sister's shoulder hardly and scolded: 'u look look look, no buy, no say thank you! NO MANNERS!' and then stomped off. i was so shocked by her rude and odd behaviour as we were already at another store that's quite far away! didn't expect this odd woman in her fifties (the store owner) to actually chase a customer to scold him/her. i guess she ALWAYS does this to customers as another seller actually told us to continue looking at the clothes (at another store) and ignore her. what i'm trying to say is, customers have customer rights. it doesn't mean that after we look we HAVE to buy."

5,5.0,"This is not only the best shopping destination I have encountered, but also the only review where I have given an 'excellent' rating. As someone who loves shopping, this place is absolutely fantastic. Seoul is known for its shopping, and from this mall I can clearly see why. The mall has cleverly separated its departments into different levels. They know their main demographic is the ladies, so 4/6 (or 3/5) of its floors are for women's fashion/ accessories. They only allocated one floor for the men and another for the children. Basically, the gave one floor each to the men and children and gave the remaining to the people whom appreciates good fashion and shopping: the ladies.The clothes they sell there have good quality and are really in style with the Korean fashion trends. Trying on clothes that I have bought makes me feel like I have just stepped into the Korean Drama realm. This is an especially great place to bring your teenage daughter, for their merchandise is really aimed at the younger crowd. The clothes here have really nice colors and cool designs, with texts and even cartoon characters and caricatures, something I don't see very fashionable for the older crowd.The quality of their merchandise are very good and pleasant to touch. However, that contributes to its higher than average prices. It definitely is more cost efficient to shop here than shop at places like Gucci or Burberry (and lets be real here the clothes they sell here are so much prettier than what you get there), which is why I love it here so much. The prices can make you feel a little overwhelmed if you are used to shopping at flea markets and bazaars (I mostly shop at Bugis Street), but for a good quality and pretty jacket that cost 50000 won is quite acceptable if you ask me. You will definitely need to pour out some cash if you are going to shop here seriously, but its not as if you need to make it rain with money here like you do when buying things from designer label brands. And at the end of the day what you pay is what you get, and who really wants things of bad quality because of its low prices these days anyway? I left the building with a huge recycling bag filled with my purchases that could easily weigh up to to a few kilos (I had a very hard and tiring night after leaving and going back to my hotel with all that weight I had to bring back.) I guess one bad thing about the place is its ventilation. We came during winter time and taking off our coats would mean we had to carry it throughout our shopping spree, and that would greatly inconvenience us. Wow the heater was unforgiving! We were practically sweating! The first time we did so in Korea! The sellers could have also been a little more polite, especially at the men's department where their behavior towards us made us a little uncomfortable. The other sellers were much better to us, even when we rejected what they were selling, they just gave us a little puppy pout like in those girls in KDramas, which did not make me feel guilty nor threatened, unlike the shops in China (I forgot which city) where a rejection meant an instant sour face. Finally, a sitting area would be nice, because we certainly needed to take a break from all that shopping, and we did not. Our legs were swelling, and my mother refused to put down the heavy bag of purchases on the floor while we shopped, so you can image how tired we were. To sum it up, this is a paradise to spend money at. I came here twice during my stay in South Korea and this was easily the best part of it."
6,4.0,"There were 5 stories top 2 were men fashions,1st-3rd were mostly women and B1 were babies and toddlers.Don't be afraid to ask for discounts as its a wholesale mall after all. The more pieces u buy the more discount u get.It's opened until pretty late or early in the morning!!"
7,4.0,"But they are very pushy. My mum bought a â‚©225000 ""leather"" jacket but i think we may have been ripped off lol anyway apart from the ultrrraaa ultra pushy retailers shopping is decent. Cash=discount and they speak some english. Affordable shopping though. More for young people."
8,5.0,"Our favourite place to shop after everything else has closed, cos Migliore opens till 5am in the morning. Although some find this mall a little pricier than others, we are familiar with where our favourite shops are, and keep coming back. Besides, bargaining is allowed, so we have a chance to practise our negotiation skills. There is also 1 shop in the corner near the escalator on one of the mid-floors that sells lots of Korean souvenirs and Kpop memorabilia. The shop owner is very friendly and generous with discounts, so we usually buy all our gifts here."
9,4.0,"If Bangkok have MBK & Platinum malls, Seoul beats them as Migliore and the one beside it are open till early morning! Lots of selections at fairly good quality and reasonable price. Although haggling for the price can be tricky at times coz others are willing to give addl discounts while others don't. The upper levels for men's wear are more lively as the male sales people are more willing to accommodate price haggling."
