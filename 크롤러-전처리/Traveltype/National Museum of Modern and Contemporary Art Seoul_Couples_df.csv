2,5.0,"... You don't need an audio guide. There is free admission on the last Wednesday of the month and one exhibit we saw focused on up and coming Korean artists. The exhibit showed the state of mind of Korea right now. It was more insightful than reading a book or talking to Koreans. Evocative and yet not too complex for normal folks. Staff was excellent, kind, and helpful. The only problem we had was finding the front entry door because we had walked north from Insadong. A must see in Seoul!"
3,5.0,I have been to many museums in Seoul now and this is a good one.  Not very big but still good.  And in a very good location next to the most popular place in town and less then 10 minutes walk from the King Sejong and Admiral Yi statues and museums.
4,5.0,"This MMCA location showcases Korean art, and they also get high-quality international exhibits.  A slightly awkward building, but that is to quibble.  Absolutely worth a visit if contemporary art speaks to you."
5,5.0,"This museum is situated in the northern part of Seoul.  The museum is very close to the Kyungbok palace which was the main palace during the last dynasty of Korea.  The museum's construction concept is ""Multiple Islands surrounded by sea (actually developed into small open yards following Korean traditional construction concepts and this open areas are very good space for large sculptures, etc.  The museum's display of modern contemporary arts periodically reorganized and designated inner spaces are decorated by carefully chosen artists supported by large corporations of Korea.   As a local I strongly recommend to visit this place if you have a plan to visit the the main palace area.  There are small but nice Korean traditional food restaurants nearby this museum (also the very children-friendly place)."
6,4.0,"It's a huge space for exhibiting modern and contemporary art mainly. The MMCA Seoul branch offers a spacious courtyard, some gift shops, a theater and a cafeteria among some other shops. The location makes it even more attractive, it's right next to Gyeongbokgung Palace and other main attractions. There's a small admission fee which is totally worth it, considering that they've brought the works of Gilles Barbier, William Kentridge and Leandro Erlich before, just to name a few. Personally, I love the surrounding areas but I find the architecture of the very building somewhat cold and orderly. Interestingly, it used to be the old Defense Security Command building."
7,4.0,"It is questionable whether all the pieces on show are worthy of the name 'Art'. Whilst it begins well by showing how a craft can become an artwork, it seems to develop into a need to fill space with projected images and other video films which are not worthy of the space dedicated to them. Fortunately there is a cafe and cafeteria on site where one can review the different exhibits."
8,3.0,"The repurposed ship's hull at the entrance is intriguing and inviting, and the gift shops full of well-designed traditional and modern goods are good hunting ground for souvenirs. But check the current exhibitions carefully before paying to see inside. There is no standing collection and when we went the temporary exhibitions were extremely sparse and underwhelming - just one work worth seeing, and room after corridor after atrium of empty space."
9,3.0,"This big impressive looking complex is located opposite Gyongbokgung Palace, around the corner from the main entrance.  It seems to be a big white empty space without much in it. We wandered around looking for exhibits but it seemed that most of the galleries were closed so perhaps they were in the process of changing.  Found it difficult to navigate and to work out where to go (even with the map).  We saw a huge installation, by a german artist, of 4 shipping containers frames with fountains coming out that spelled random words (very interesting), a room full of balls of clay on a table and a young architects exhibit (mildly interesting), a few sculptures outside and that was about it.  Just had a coffee and moved on. Plenty of Koreans there with kids running around.  probably just enjoying the airconditioning."
10,4.0,"The Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (MMCA) includes three branches around Seoul, the main branch being located at the former Defence Security Command building on Samcheong-ro near Gyeongbokgung Palace. Opening Hours 10am to 6pm (T,TH,F,SN) and 10am to 9pm (W,ST), closed on Mondays. Here you will find eight exhibition halls spread over three levels of this large building. Presently there is a large collection of works by Korean contemporary artist Suh Se Ok on display. This is a series of abstract images that represent people. The works are peculiar and interesting to view. You can take photographs as well if you like. We also enjoyed seeing the large installation that dropped water in a sequence and pattern, spelling out various English words and phrases. This was neat, as were some of the works included in the Ahn Kyuchul 'Invisible Land of Love' exhibition. There were some peculiar works in the downstairs exhibition halls as well. We liked the mechanical junk works that moved around on the floor. That certainly had a way of grabbing your attention, regardless of your liking the works or not. Overall, we were quite pleased with our visit to the MMCA Seoul branch. They do a pretty good job of filling the halls with interesting modern and contemporary art that is interesting and fun to look over.  We didn't fall in love with any of the works here but were happy with our visit and would definitely consider a return during future trips to Seoul. Note: Do check out ongoing and future exhibitions on the MMCA website in advance of your visit to Seoul. This can help you determine if the art on display meets your art tastes or not."
11,5.0,"This museum is right near Gyeonbokgung, near the exit by the folk museum so decided to give it a look and was extremely glad that I did as it turned out to be one of the highlights of Seoul.The curating is excellent and presents a number of Korean artists that showcase a contemporary emotional reflection, a query into identity and what it means to be Korean, the country's rapid development, amongst many other issues. Pieces are powerful and linger with you for a while. I would highly recommend paying this museum a visit and prioritizing it on your to see list. You do not have to be an art lover to visit the museum, pieces are fun, playful, while others make for good photo ops as well. Very child friendly."
12,5.0,"I have been to a lot of contemporary art museums and this is up there with the best! You won't find the big international stars, but the exhibitions of Korean artists are fantastic. The curators have done a great job here, and again and again you blown away by the displays. Both in size and in magnitude. Well worth a visit, even though you are not an art buff."
13,5.0,"If you like contemporary art, the sleek looking museum is a great museum. It is an impressive space that is full of large scale exhibits. When we visited we were lucky to see the Do Ho Suh installation among other outstanding exhibits. The museum is located in a charming location, in a cluster of other museums, cafes and art galleries. It is a nice and relaxing way to spend a day."
14,5.0,"The main reason why we visited here is because of the 1600 Pandas event. Good thing it was also scheduled when we were in Seoul. Since this is a one time event, the pandas won't be there anymore. Good thing we were able to catch it before it transfers to another city. As for the museum, the place is full of large art pieces."
15,5.0,"This museum is situated at the end of Deoksugung grounds. In front of the museum building is a fountain in a pond. At the time we visited, there was a special exhibition of  the artist Jung Takyoung. There were sketches and drawings, paintings, handicraft works and abstract paintings. We were very impressed with a portrait of himself and his paper cuttings. The exhibition will be on until 28 June. Do visit and witness the many talents of Takyoung."
16,5.0,"This is a new building. So very clean and clear traffic line. I love LEE BUL exhibition. And other installation. But, ticketing woman was very unkind."
17,4.0,"If you're into art and want a fresh perspective on contemporary works, this is definitely worth checking out. There are some really unique paintings, sculptures, exhibitions, and rooms dedicated to different styles and works of art. Certainly worth checking out for any art lover. I do agree with some of the comments that there could be a bit more, but it's certainly not lacking."
18,5.0,Plan to spend the afternoon.  Free admission for seniors.  A very large recently constructed museum with a wide range of modern art and architecture.
19,5.0,"Not too many visitors, but a great space to see Art from planet Korea. Have a break from wandering around the Hanuk village, head down towards the palace, and you will find it. Helpful staff, quite a lot of interpretation in English, a fair price - 7000 to see all the bits on display today, and you have a great way to spend a couple of hours.  If you like to go to places where there are more Locals than tourists, interactive exhibits and an atmosphere which suits kids and adults alike, give it a go."
