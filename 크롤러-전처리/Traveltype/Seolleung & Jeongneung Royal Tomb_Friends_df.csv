Good to walk in the forest.- Entrance is only 1,000 won. And there are conditions to enter free or get discount.- 10-time ticket can save money."
1,5.0,"This is a UNESCO site that is a bargain for the W1,000 you pay to gain entry.  A breath of fresh air and green space in the gleaming, sterile district of Gangnam, it's a good place to catch a mix of history and nature amidst one of Seoul's most glitzy areas.There are three tombs dating to the early Joseon dynasty and several nice walking paths between.  The small museum on the site has very little translated into any languages other than Korean, but the site and its paths alone make a visit worthwhile.  Very calming."

This site consists of three tombs of two emperors and an empress from the Joseon dynasty.This site is unlike the relatively inaccessible Qing tombs near Beijing: you could not access the interior of the tombs nor walk near it (except a small restricted potion at the empress tomb).The location of the tombs with the juxtaposition of cityscape around them made this site unique. With the autumn foliage around us, it made for a refreshing walk in the morning. Have a look at the video presentation near the toilets at the entrance to have a better appreciation of the construction of the tombs."
