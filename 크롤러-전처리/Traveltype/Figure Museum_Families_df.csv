0,4.0,It was our 3rd family holidays in Seoul with our 5 yrs old 7 mths daughter. The figure is my husband wishlist so we went early after our breakfast via subway. It is not difficult to find and once we get out from the exit then walk few steps. It not too big but i think up to 3/ 4 level. I miss a chance to take spiderman picture ^-^
