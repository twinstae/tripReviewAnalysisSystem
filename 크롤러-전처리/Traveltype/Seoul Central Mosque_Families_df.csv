0,5.0,"If are a Muslim in particular,and you are in Seoul, never miss the opportunity to visit and perform solah at Seoul Central Mosque. Located on a high hill in Itaewon, if you are not on excursion, you can reach there by taxi (easier but slightly costly) or bus. There are many halal restaurants around it. Take note that the nearest bus stop along main road on north side, and you need to go thru quite a steep wide staircase. Just be careful especially when wet."

2,5.0,"always love to come here and pray here, wonderful mosque especially at night. My second time here after 2014."
3,5.0,The masjid is high up on a hill. Please wear   comfortable shoes. There are toilets and ablution facilities for women and men. A beautiful masjid indeed.
4,5.0,"The women ablution and toilet are located outside the masjid. Like all other sites in Seoul, most of the places use automatic light (auto sensor light) Women prayer room is situated at 3rd floor. Quite a challenge for old people to climb the stairs. Stairs and prayer hall is fully carpeted. The women prayer area is quite dark but equipped with fans, sejadah and lots of telekung. We can witness the men praying from the 3rd floor. The masjid interior is decorated with beautiful Islamic designed mosaic. Imam's voice is melodious and I feel so peaceful praying in this masjid."
5,5.0,"A must visit for all Muslims. The mosque is situated up on a hill. Quite a walk from Itaewon subway. Maybe taking a taxi will be better for older folks. For young ones, no issues. The female prayer area is upstairs. If you are coming at night, the stairs appeared dark but no worries it has a sensor... So with movement, the passageway will be lit up. There are fans and heaters depending on the season that you visit. Lots of halal eateries nearby."
6,5.0,Perfect mosque to visit with many halal restaurants and foods surrounding that area. Many hostels and hotels neat by. If you need to travel to seoul town there is train station near by walking distance. The negative side of it is the area is on top of hill. Elder need assistance
7,5.0,It’s a Muslim house to worship we call it Masjid. But Whither you’re Muslim or not you should go see the place and there’s a guide to explain...
8,4.0,"Most Muslims live in Bogwang-dong and Itaewon-dong. That's because this is the only (probably) mosque in Seoul.Visitors are muslims and a few Koreans with curiosity.- Comparing to mosques in mid-east, this is just a simple one. I have been around several times and never heard ezan from outside.- This mosque is locating on a high area. It'll be a bit of climbing from Itaewon Station.- There are some Turkish restaurants and dessert shops nearby. But, arabic ones are relatively fewer."

13,5.0,"After a good meal at the Eid Restaurant nearby, I headed towards the mosque. It was during winter and I realised that the praying hall was upstairs and the place to take wudhu was located near the car park, in a container-ish block. So, I had to go up to the entrance of the prayer hall, took out my shoes, wore a pair of slippers provided and went down to the wudhu area with my freezing feet! I wasn't complaining as it was just an experience as I've never been to a place this cold.It is such a peaceful mosque. And beautiful too. I went with my wife and son. It is located in Itaewon district so, expect a short uphill journey from the train station to the mosque. It's not that hard to find as you will see the entrance from afar. More stairs to get to the mosque compound.Highly recommend to visit if you happen to be in Itaewon area. And if there's a chance, visit during Friday prayers. It would be a good experience."
14,5.0,Very beautiful mosque looking over the great city of Seoul. You can come and learn more about Islam and pick up some books and take amazing pictures.
15,5.0,Took subway till itaewon station (exit 2). Then walk about 10 minutes to reach there.There is one man (ahjussi) i think he is a caretaker here. He showed me a way to the women area (at 4th floor and make sure to take wudhuk first at the back of the mosque). He is very helpful.
16,5.0,"We took a metro to arrive and exit number 2 would be the nearest to achieved the masjed. However it a big masjed, it has a classes for both men and women."
17,5.0,Nice place to be at. Its like on hill top and you can have a view of far. Moreover would get a glimpse of muslim place of worship.
18,4.0,The mosque in Itaewon and surrounded by a lot of Halal restaurants and markets which sells halal food
19,4.0,"The only mosque in Seoul is in the heart of Itaewon. It's a must-visit for any Muslim who's looking for a place to pray and for someplace to get good halal food. The climb to the mosque is a bit steep so it may be tough for someone who has knee trouble. The mosque offers brochures in Koreans introducing Islam and answering some popular questions that non-Muslims normally ask, and also has the Friday sermon available for anyone who's interested. Near the mosque are plenty of restaurants that serve halal food such as Eid which serves traditional Korean food."
