0,5.0,"Well manicured historical home with preserved furniture and building.  There are videos to explain the history as well as plaques to identify the different aspects of the home.  I visited as part of the free tour from the Incheon Airport, so I can't speak about how easy it is to find.  I would allocate only about 30 minutes to this and make sure to include it in all the other palaces, attractions that are within walking distance.  It was free to visit and I enjoyed experiencing historical Korean life."
