0,5.0,One of my favourite places in the gallery/museum district (or so I call it). Interesting and well curated shows. The production standards of the exhibits are excellent. The accompanying museum store has well made and well priced merchandise. A Must visit for anyone in Seoul.
1,5.0,"격주마다 진행되는 Sunday Live 프로그램이 매우 인상적이었습니다.저렴한 가격에 좋은 공연을 볼수 있기도 하고, 전시 자체도 독특해서 관람해볼만합니다.Must visit place if you love K-indie music and unique art."
2,4.0,"I visited an exhibition of paper art. Small museum, but very interesting! Warmly recommended. W6000 fee.Don't miss the lovely ""Cafe & Concept Store"" at our right hand as you exit the museum (not the ""Art Cafe Space"" on the left hand, next to the tickets office)."
3,4.0,Very nice little museum dedicated to changing contemporary art exhibitions. The location allows for further exploration of the charming Seochong area with its little cafes and historic residents of poets and artists.
4,5.0,"I visited Daelim Museum in the end of April 2015. In fact, I came to Seoul for two things: to watch Paul McCartney's concert and to see the Linda McCartney Retrospective Photo Exhibition at Daelim Museum. The museum is not that large but it's very homey. The exhibition takes 3 floors. The souvenir shop is located on the first floor and they sell McCartney's merchandises like posters, postcards, bags, and books.The surrounding area is clean, the design is standard sophisticated yet simple museum/gallery. Selfie stick is prohibited in the museum. Staff are also very helpful, some of them speak good english and one of them even asked me if there is any more question that I'd like to ask. Just avoid to go there at the weekend because you need to queue and the queue is very long! Maybe it's because of the Paul McCartney concert that would be held less than in a week, so many Korean youngsters visit the museum for Linda McCartney's exhibition. I also noticed they have some kind of pop up market, you need to check the schedule for this."
