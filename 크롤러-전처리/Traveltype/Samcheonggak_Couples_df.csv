0,4.0,"We booked for lunch through our hotel concierge and made use of the free shuttle service provided by the restaurant. Was at the pick-up point five minutes before the scheduled time and the van arrived promptly to bring us there.The drive up a meadering hill was scenic with tall trees & fresh air. When we arrived at the entrance to the restaurant, we were awed by the beautiful landscaped garden surrounding the ""palace"" restaurant.We dined at the main hall and the service staff were really tip-top. The prices are not cheap though but we order 2 set menus consisting of about 10 items which cost about Kwn69,000/- . Since we wanted to try a different kind of cuisine, we decided to pay for this extravagant lunch.The food was fine and quantity small but enough to fill you up at the end of the meal. The cooking style was not oily and most items looked braised or stewed.I will recommend this restaurant if you want to dine at a restaurant with a nice ambience and beautiful surroundings."

3,4.0,"This is a place with restaurants offering good food at premium price. Apparently, this place is patronized by mainly well-dressed people, so please wear something more presentable too, so that you will not feel out of place. We had a multiple course lunch at the Samcheonggak Restaurant for 2 persons (and yes, the lunch menu required for a minimum 2 persons). Please be informed that it is fine dining (read: some portions in nicely decorated style).You can experience the quietness of place, and several traditional buildings that are well maintained and nicely landscaped. After your lunch or tea break, you may take a short walk around the place to see it's building and garden. Not a very big place, so just a couple of hours here will do (including lunch). There is a shuttle bus that will bring you out to the nearest metro station."
