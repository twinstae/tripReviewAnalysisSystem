1,3.0,"I would rather go to Seoul N Tower which is an outdoor activity while walking up a sprawling park.  I have been to 63 City a few times and have eaten at the Chinese restaurant at the top from reservation only as well.  The tower is located in the middle of Seoul, but best visited after a rainy day else visibility suffers.  It is a great location to see the city and you can see a decent amount around.  I would go with tempered expectations just because of smog and occasional dirty windows."
2,5.0,"Spectacular visit of Seoul from the observation deck. This is one of the towers from which to witness that skyscraper view of the city. The building contains other attractions as well including an aquarium, shopping, and fine dining."
