1,4.0,"I personally enjoyed shopping here more than the Hongdae shopping street (for women's clothing). There are two long rows of shops parallel to each other selling lots of affordable women's aparrel and jewellery. Not exactly premium top-class items, but decent quality for the prices. Did not see any menswear but I did not manage to explore the whole length of stores. It's a good shopping option for a rainy day and there are a couple of food options located at the end of the indoor shopping street."

3,3.0,"More tourists than locals especially from China and HK that anything else here. Rows and rows of shops selling similar stuff, all at reasonable prices and designs.You’ll see things repeated in shops as you browse through more. Don’t expect to find great quality items here but if you want a cheap thrill and have time to kill, this is the place for you.Express bus terminal station, exit 8. The stuff here is Sicilian to Hongdae or Ewha. In the end, all the same."
4,3.0,"It's a very big station with lot of shops selling clothes, handphone assesories etc. mostly have shops selling the same stuff. Doesn't seem that we can bargain here although some said it was possible. There is a Japanese eatery which serves pretty nice food for the low price. Can easily get lost inside if you are not familiar with place. Crowded. Toilets are located inside which require a distance to walk. At different corners of the underground place."
5,3.0,"There are many stores but in the end, they are selling more or less the same thing.  I focus on clothing section only.  Don't have high expectations but it's an interesting experience to search for good bargain and negotiate with the aunties staff.  Better wear a facial mask cause the place is packed not only with tourists but also local  housewives."
6,4.0,Not a big one. Still one of the best places to buy cheap clothes. Goto Mall is better than this mall.
7,4.0,"Similar to taipei railway station underground shopping area. Lots of cheap causal clothing, shoes and bags for ladies.  Trendy and you will be spoilt for choices. However, not many business wear or blazer for working."
8,3.0,"We visited this shopping mall twice as we wanted to get shelter due to the rain. Not really a big underground mall but it has whatever you need. Clothes, shoes, accessories, makeup products and eateries. The prices of the apparel I won't say its very cheap neither too expensive. Prices are comparable to those you get find it in Myeondong. Can visit this mall if you have the time."
9,5.0,"After reading up blogs on shopping spots to visit in Seoul, the express bus terminal was our last out of the 5 places to visit (myeong dong, namdaemun, lotte world and  dongdaemun).It is such a little hidden gem as we were quite lost in the beginning coming out of the subway and thought that the little strip outside the gates were it. Surely it cannot be! Undeterred, we went hunting and finally found direction to ""Goto mall"" and lo-and-behold, shopping with the locals! There were strips of shops as far as your eyes can see and true to reviews, prices for clothes do start from 5000krw! You might want to have a look at everything first because some shops may sell the exact same thing for cheaper (which me and my sister missed out on as we were too excited and prices just seemed right to us). Not counting that we were also tired as it has been a 12 hours day of walking for us, we just didn't bother to go through the shops first before purchasing. Nevertheless, the prices are considerably cheap and there are restaurants or little mom and pop shops you could rest your feet at. At the end of our shopping blitz, we just HAD to go back to the station entrance to get our daily manju.  These are little breads in the shape of a fish, filled with custard. At 3000krw for 15 pieces, we just had to spoil ourselves. Certainly recommend looking out for this as it is a nice little extra treat to seal your day with a kiss."
