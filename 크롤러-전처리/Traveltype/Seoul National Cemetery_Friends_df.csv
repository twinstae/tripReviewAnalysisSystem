0,4.0,"I recently visited the Seoul National Cemetery with friends during the peak cherry blossom bloom time in the city. We found it by searching for the best places to see cherry blossoms in Seoul and it didn't disappoint! The blooms were absolutely stunning in/around the cemetery. We enjoyed a very pleasant walk and took lots of photos of the trees and other landscaping. It is unbelievably clean and well-maintained. Parts of the part reminded us of Arlington national cemetery in the USA. There are lots of interesting sculptures, building architecture, and walking paths to enjoy. It would be a nice place to spend a few hours enjoying the fresh air with kids or adults."
1,4.0,A very calm and impressive area. It is a huge cemetery that spreads out basically still in the middle of Seoul. It reminds one of the sacrifices that are necessary for a nation and its people to be free. I really liked the fact that not just soldiers but also patriots as well as honorable citizens are buried here!
