0,2.0,"Disclaimer: I can’t stand modern art.However, this museum convinced me that I will never enjoy it. Don’t get me wrong. There were about three things that I liked there but hated the rest. I will share 5 of the weirdest ones and 3 that I liked. To get to this museum, you will come out of Anguk Station, Exit 3 and walk a couple minutes. It will be on your left. The admission is ₩10,000 for adults."
1,5.0,"Very funny building, you feel like an explorer, finding works of art in all sorts of nooks and crannies. Lots of video-art, lots of Asian art, very nicely curated by a seriously good collector, I loved this museum. Full of surprises. It looked closed from the outside, I am glad I tried to open the door nevertheless. Not very many visitors, on a Sunday afternoon in January. Lots of time and space to look at everything without other people in the same room."
2,5.0,"Visited alone one morning, the whole experience, from the audio guide to the artworks themselves was really great. The space was really interesting and well designed. I find that sometimes Asian galleries can be a bit hit and miss, but this was a hit.Staff were a bit cold, I put it down to being the only guy in Seoul without Make-up on. It’s a bloody gallery."
3,4.0,"Whoever is still interested, should check out this place. It's a maze of rooms filled with art pieces, some needing time to be understood. I spent only one hour there (closing time), and left with more questions than answers, but it was well worth for my learning curve. Cosy cafe with free wifi. Free audio tour guide in English, in exchange for your ID/passport."
4,5.0,"Quirky modern art museum, quirky in  the sense of the way exhibits are displayed. You follow a narrow labyrinthine route round the building watching your head for low ceilings in some places.Good cafe  too."
