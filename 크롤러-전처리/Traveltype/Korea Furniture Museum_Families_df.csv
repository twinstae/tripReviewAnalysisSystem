The guided tour in English was very informative and the place is full of harmony and beauty, a balcony over the city. Wifes at the last G7 meeting in Seoul had lunch there. My Mum told me the price was very expensive, I can' t remember the price as we have been there three years ago."
2,5.0,"Don't be put off by the museum's name. This museum is a glimpse into the social history of Korea, based on the material culture of the people who lived there. We had to book a few days ahead for the English-speaking tour. Our guide was exceptional - she clearly knew the collection very well and her passion came through in a calm and quiet way, much like the museum itself. One of the highlights of our visit to Seoul.Make the most of your trip up the hill and visit the temple down the hill from this museum before you come."
