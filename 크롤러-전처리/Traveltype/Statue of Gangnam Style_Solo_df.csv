0,4.0,A trendy landmark of seoul that if you have enough time you must visit it... not only because it has fun but also of the great interest of the area.. with nice skyscrapers and mall and a special museum dedicated to the modern design
1,4.0,Totally didnâ€™t get what they were until I saw on trip advisor! Right next to the COEX! love that they have a little statue decided to Gangnam style.
2,5.0,If you wanna see the huge hands forming the famous dance of the Gangnam style music video go outside the Starfield Library (mall). You also can watch the video again.
3,3.0,It's kinda cool to see the statue and take pics. That's really about it but the location is next to the COEX so it's worth a visit so you can do great shopping after you do the horse dance.
