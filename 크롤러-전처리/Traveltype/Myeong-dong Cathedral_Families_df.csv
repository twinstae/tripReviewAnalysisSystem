We were awed by its beauty that we decided to attend mass even though it was in Korean. I am impressed by how the mass was celebrated, very solemn and sacred.

44,5.0,"A beautiful gothic Catholic Cathedral of great significance. Pope Francis visited this place in 2014. There is an underground where martyrs are buried; also shopping, cafe and books. Interior is prayerfully silent with the awesome presence of the divine. Take a rest and visit this holy site. Seek blessings for a safe holiday.

Opposite the cathedral is the YWCA and next to the cathedral is an awesome shop on level 2 serving great hot korean porridge."
45,5.0,Spotted a few grottos in the church. Big area with many sights to offer for local and tourists aside.
46,5.0,This cathedral seems to be hidden among the busy streets of Myeongdong and its surrounding buildings/malls. That does not mean that the cathedral is tiny because it is magnificently tall and regal. It's a great cathedral to visit while in Seoul.
47,3.0,"We just stay in hotel near to the Cathedral, and Sami it every morning when we walked out after breakfast. But the dense and tall buildings might distract you from seeing the cathedral. Majority of passerby would just look out for shopping, and eating at Myeong - dong area."

61,5.0,"So thankful that the catholic cathedral was located within walking distance of our hotel, the TMark.  Beautiful surroundings and even more beautiful church inside."
62,4.0,There was a flea market when we visited on a Saturday evening. The cathedral reminds us of the one in Sydney but this one is renovated with modern interior at the flea market area. Go to the flea market inside at the basement and you get to see more Korean home made products instead of the commercial ones at the streets. Benches outside is a great place just to relax after a long walk at Myeongdong street and enjoying the bell rang before the mass.
63,4.0,The place was so solemn inside and the architecture is so beautiful. it was quite a hike going up to the Cathedral but it was all worth it. We were so blessed to catch the English mass on a Sunday.

72,5.0,"It was my family's 2nd trip to Seoul. As usual, we will attend the Sunday 9 am Mass, which is in English. I like the Gothic architecture and the Nativity crib placed below the altar at Christmas. The ""Door of Mercy"" is at the left side of the Church ( when facing the altar). There is a very big and peaceful grotto at the back of the Church. It's a very nice and quiet place to pray. My wife and I went to the Church cafe and had a simple hot noodle dish ..... It was one of the best noodle dish we had during our trip, for just 2,000 won ! The coffee was superb."
73,5.0,Attended 9am English Mass at this beautiful church.  Very orderly managed by the wardens when it comes to gift offerings and communion. Has a large piety store on site that carries a huge variety of religious gifts.  A must go for all Catholics.
74,4.0,It is a cathedral that still offers prayers services daily situated at the edge of myeongdong.  There were choirs singing out side the church the Sunday I was there.

77,1.0,The architecture is pretty average looking. There is nothing much here as well. You may like to pass-by but don't need to spend too much time here.
78,4.0,"One place I feel every catholic in Seoul should visit. This cathedral is located at the upper end of the myeong-dong shopping area. The staircase leading to the cathedral itself is beautiful, and one should take time climbing up to the cathedral. The cathedral is especially beautiful at night with many people, both locals and tourists."
79,5.0,"We actually forgot to visit the cathedral until the last day at night, but even at night this place was open. The building itself is beautiful but it is peaceful inside. If you are Christian, I highly suggest you visit."
80,5.0,"Myeong-dong is easily my most favorite spot in Seoul, and Myeong-dong Cathedral is the cherry on top of my cake. Personally, it came out as a sight to behold on the outside and a beautiful serene place on the inside. The mass celebration was straightforward and people were very disciplined and respectful. I'm really glad I came across this Cathedral. It was a wonderful surprise at the end of a stroll around Myeong-dong. :)"
81,3.0,Busy shopping and need a pit stop? this cathedral is located just beside the Myeong-dong shopping with the castle style buildings in the horizon. Worth the stop for a nice photo shot!
82,5.0,"It's right outside Myeongdong shopping district, or taxis its 8 mins / 3000 won ride. Nice inside structure."
83,4.0,English mass was at 9 to 10 am . We were late so we attended the 10 am korean mass. They give out palms outside the church. In my country we have to pay for the palm. Some women wear veils and hanbok dress. In my country you rarely see women wearing veils. I admire the koreans with regards to their discipline during the offertory and the communion rites.To get to the cathedral get off myeongdong subway station exit 8 turn left at the first street just a few meters from the exit. You will pass by 2 narrow street.Along the way are lots of skin and cosmetic shops. The third and widest street turn right was where the cathedral was located.
84,5.0,"It's a very majestic building with very high ceiling and tall stained glass windows of gothic architecture.  The Cathedral stands on a hill and there're a few flights of steps to reach it at the top.We went there thrice; to attend a Korean Mass which was full to overflowing (so impressive); an English Christmas Mass at 0900 (which was not too crowded) and another Korean Mass on a Saturday evening (7 pm) with hymns sung in Latin.  These Latin hymns were sung so beautifully that we were transported into heaven.  Never have we heard such delightful singing before.(The toilet is located on the right side when you reach the top.  There're signs to lead you.Myeongdong Cathedral is right in the midst of shops, easily to do shopping before or after attending Mass.)"
85,4.0,"Nice place to take a look with a gothic style. Oldest Cathedral. Most of the mass timings are in korean. If you would like to go for the english mass, please approach someone for the timing (e.g Korean tourism board). It is normally on Sundays 9am. Went there for the Christmas mass and enjoyed it :DPlease do not miss the grotto just behind the main church building."
86,5.0,"Amazing that it hides from busy world - Myeongdong. My family went there on Sunday, weather was wonderful though it was around zero degree. It was realised that a lot of TV shooting teams were there to have Christmas programs!"

88,5.0,"It was a peaceful, spiritually-filled visit. The quiet snow outside added to the enchanting feel of the place."
89,4.0,"We arrived at Myeongdong station and decided to take Exit 9 (which was indicated as the exit to the Cathedral).  It was a big mistake because the route will bring you pass exit 10, up a slope along the main road and down before turning left to the shopping street then you'll notice the Cathedral.  The easier way would be to take Exit 8 then walk through the shopping street.The Cathedral is beautiful and a nice contrast to the surroundings.  There was a wedding ceremony during our visit so we didn't explore the interior much."
90,4.0,"Right in the middle of Myeongdong area, this Cathedral and its adjacent convent dates back to the 19th century, and has coffee shops, souvenir stores just underneath the Cathedral.  Inside the Cathedral the atmosphere is serene, and it is an easy sight to take it before you do shopping or have a meal in the area, which is in the centre of Seoul.  It is not far from Insadong, just a few minutes taxi ride away, another nice area with characteristic shops and restaurants."
91,5.0,"Head east from Myeongdong is the Myeongdong Cathedral (enter through the Myeongdong-gil and up the hill). Lovely church, we arrived at night and the Cathedral looks stunning under the stars.  My 3 year old son was so delighted to see the lovely deco on the trees beside the Cathedral, and he received a candy from the sister after the mass."
92,5.0,Visited this place On 24 October 2013. I took about 1 hour for photo shoot with my family and explore this place then relax a bit. Worthed to go when around myeongdong shopping area. I wanted to go there due to korean drama: You're beautiful. This Cathedral is really a tranquil place in the middle of hustle and bustle of myeongdong area. One of my fave destination ( actually I really love going to South Korea cause every place was unique and all became my fave heheho ^^) I went there by bus no. 504 and stopped in namdaemun market then walked there. Asked some Koreans and they really helped a lot (show its picture If you could not speak Korean well) even an ajoushi lead half the way there. Korean really helpful and care to little children ( especially ajumma & ajoushi : old people) ^ ^ .
93,4.0,In fact we went to this church due to rain but we were very happy the place is very nice and calm. Library has some souvenirs for sale (little expensive) very nice place to stay in calm for a while. This has a free wifi. Worth a visit.
