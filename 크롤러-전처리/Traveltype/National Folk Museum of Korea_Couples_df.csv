2,3.0,"the national folk museum is worth seeing if you are into these kinds of attractions. even so, its not very comprehensive."
3,4.0,"This museum is located at the rear entrance to the Gyeonbokgung Palace.  Depending on your level of interest, your visit can be relatively short  or longer,. In either case, this is a worthwhile site.  Like most sites in South Korea, there a a number of steps to navigate."
4,5.0,"I have to admit I was drawn to the building by the gardens and it’s architecture. The fact that it was free admission was another benefit. Cafes and toilets on a long day sightseeing, clinched the deal. But it was wonderfully developed. Really enjoyed learning of the manufacturing history of the local area  the stories of people.The exhibits are interesting and little touches like being encouraged o try on traditional head wear, all brought the experience to life. The korean people are proud of where they have come from, and this visit showed us why."
5,2.0,We quickly went in here after spending a lot of time at the Gyeongbokgung palace. There is just a lot of stuff in here and it wasn’t that interesting to us at that point. If you are an antique buff then this could be right up your alley! Not to us after spending a lot of time at the palace.

6,4.0,"This is a museum dedicated to honouring day to day life on the Korean Peninsula since it’s early days. There’s no mention of the war with the North in this museum which is great as that’s everywhere else! The three exhibits show a different facet of Korean life. All of them insightful and enjoyable. Entry is free, so once you’ve finished the Palace then check this out!"
7,4.0,"Right on the grounds of Gyeongbakgung Palace, this gem of a museum documents Korean life.  As a Senior, our admission was free which was a nice bonus.  Take your time to visit and learn about Korean life, past and present; they do a beautiful job of documenting and displaying everything and you can literally spend hours there."
8,5.0,This will be the first structure you will see if you will enter via the east gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace. A better route if you ask me.
9,4.0,This was worth the time to experience. We found it to be very interesting seeing the history and articles of Korea.
10,3.0,The museum is in the grounds of the gyeongbok palace.you need a guide to explain about it.can take plenty of nice photos.it was very intresting learning about the way of life years ago and how much it has changed.we both enjoyed it.

The outside portion has a Ochon house dating back to 1848 that was donated, restored and placed here.  There is an example of a traditional Korean village."
12,4.0,The folk museum is a charming and information- laden introduction to Korea in past times. It greatly helps your understanding and appreciation of Korea.
13,4.0,Very nice facility with impressive exhibits of Korean lore through the ages. Something here for everyone. Easy pace and easy to navigate. Thoroughly enjoyed the time here. You move at you own pace. While perhaps not a must see it is worth the time and effort if you are in the area visiting the palace.
14,5.0,"We arrived on time to get an English speaking tour of the Museum.  The displays are well marked in English and Korean, but the tour guide really added to our appreciation of this museum.  Although this museum is inside the grounds of the Gyeongbokgung Palace, you do need a ticket to enter the museum.  It is a free.  I liked all of the displays of old farming tools and information about Korean life in the 1900's."
15,5.0,The museum is in the grounds of Gyongbokgung Palace and is one of the more interesting museums i have ever visited. We spent 3 hours there but if we had time we probably could have spent a lot longer. Do not miss this attraction.
16,5.0,This was a beautiful museum. i learned some interesting facts in the exhibits. You don't need a tour guide to go and if you have your ticket from the Palace then its free to get in.
17,5.0,"Very well presented and managed establishment that is built under an amazing Korean traditional structure with granite to die for. The museum houses several displays, art works and a fantastic history of the folk law of Korea. Fabulous gardens - stunning in Spring - make the visit well worth it. Traditional costumes are everywhere and you really get the feel of Korea."
18,4.0,"This museum is located behind the Gyeongbokgung Palace grounds and admission is free.  The exhibits are both outside and inside.  Outside are some shrines, statues and small buildings in a very serene setting.  Inside is a history of the Korean peninsula from the stone age to present day.  This is very well done with a timeline and a mixture of artifacts on display.  A lot of the information is also in English, which helps!  There is a cafe and toilets here as well."
19,5.0,"We happened to walk by this museum while wandering around the Palace area. I am so glad to have stopped by this museum which was well organized and did a great job in outlining the Korean history. Great presentation. Even if you only have an hour to spare, I recommend stopping by to add a little depth to your Korea visit and cultural experience."
20,5.0,"This museum gives you a good overview of the Korean people. There were museum volunteers that expanded on some of the exhibits for us. Well laid out, and not overwhelming."
21,4.0,"Right next to Gyeonbokgung Palace, topped by a tall wooden pagoda.   There are free guided tours in English at 1030 and 230.   You could instead rent an audio player for 1000krw or just read the information which is generally available in English.   The Museum presents lots of interesting artifacts and information about everyday Korean life in the past.    They had a small display about kimchi - various things it’s made from, nutritional properties, etc.   There is also an outdoor exhibition area which includes an actual restored house, with furnishings, from 1848, the Ochon House.    You can easily spend an hour or two here."
22,3.0,"Very nice building housing the museum, basically located on the campus of the Gyeongbokgung Palace.  The palace buildings are generally bare and viewable only from the outside.  This museum provides some perspective on the Korean way of life, including the evolution of the clothing, cooking, farming and family upbringing.  Nice presentation but not particularly interesting."
23,5.0,"We loved it! I work as a guide at home. So I know something about museums. And I have to admit that this museum is one of the best I’ve ever been to. The layout, visual representation, combination of old and modern. It’s just amazing. Everything is so clear. The exhibition is very interesting, you don’t get tired or bored.Highly recommended."
24,5.0,This is another historical place to learn about Korean Culture and Arts. Nice to see how they lived in their era and how Koreans start their life to their death.
25,5.0,"On the same grounds as Gyeongbokgung Palace and FREE! Easy to wander and follow the different exhibits. A volunteer approached and spent about 30 mins. walking us they different exhibits and giving us great insight into Korean culture.Only disappointment was that the gift shop was closed for renovations,"
26,5.0,"We came here on a shore excursion after visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace which is next to it.  It is a free museum.  I don't think I saw all of it because our time was limited. It had a nice gift shop, and children's area.  What I saw was life size exhibits detailing the life events of a typical South Korean family such as weddings, 60th birthday, burial as well as clothing, medical practices, etc. The first time a Korean couple in previous times met was at their wedding, although I am sure that is no longer the case. There are very interesting buildings outside as well which you pass on the way to the parking lot.  Very interesting and best of all, it is free."
27,5.0,We didn't spend too much time here because we were part of a larger tour but we definitely could have spent a lot of time here! It is a nice respite from the chilliness of December and the museum is well set up!
28,5.0,"Well laid out, lovely costumes with scenes set up to depict village life. Good historical explanations at most museums about the life and times of Koreans dating back to early times."
29,5.0,"Adjacent to the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Between the extensive palace grounds and this interesting museum, there's plenty to see. One gallery takes you through the traditional Korean life phases and another is organized around the four seasons. If you like seeing what everyday life was like in the old days, you will enjoy these exhibits. Outside there is a small recreated commercial neighborhood from the mid-20th century. Lots to see and very enjoyable."
30,4.0,"This was an interesting stop that my wife and I checked out after wandering out of the Gyeongbokgung complex.  They had some great outdoor booths exhibiting tea ceremony, traditional meals for the royals, kimchi making, etc.  Inner museum was also interesting - though the scope a little broad since it starts with stone age in Korea!  But the exhibits on the progress and development of Korean civilization and culture were neat.  Worth a visit if you're in that area (and because Gyeongbokgung is definitely worth a visit, you probably will be)."
31,4.0,"A must-go site for whoever wishes to know more about this fantastic country than whatever the Western medias feed us with.The Korea history is well covered, in an entertaining and informative manner. Special thumb-up to all the agricultural items/tools on display and to the (small) reconstitutions old Korean country homes."
32,5.0,"Came here when visiting the palace and was not disappointed. This museum has pretty much all the history of Korea, good explanations, nice set ups, videos, interactive areas. You really get to know Korean history from Korean perspective. It was well worth the visit and helped me to understand Korean culture more than I did previously."
33,4.0,If you have time this place is worth a quick visit. There are enough signs in English which helps. It shows how people in Korea used to live. It's good for understanding more about Korean culture and history.
34,5.0,"We just happened to stumble upon this museum.  Admission is free which is always a plus.  The museum is an ethnographic museum explaining the lives and culture of Korea.  I found the museum to be very interesting and informative.  If you have the time, a visit to the museum is well worth it."
35,5.0,"There were a lot of beautiful displays, especially the clothes.  The screens are very colourful.  The old artefacts were well preserved.  A well worth museum to visit."
36,5.0,"on 29th June, 2017 we visited this Museum while coming out of the nearby Palace. Very interesting and lot of unknown information can be gathered by seeing the inside. we took a lot of nice pics. Variety is mixed with architecture and traditions. It depicts how the Korean Culture developed. It will definitely give you a different flavor."
37,4.0,"This museum is the closest you will get to a time-travel machine. It's a must-see museum which is conveniently located next to the Gyeongbokgung Palace grounds, and best of all, it's free! The museum has both indoor and outdoor exhibits, both of which are set up to the finest details to transport you back to the old Korea. I loved the outdoor exhibits best as they truly gave me the perfect glimpse into how the Koreans lived their lives in the olden days."
38,5.0,"At Seoul and on a Sunday is worth a short stop, the museum it self is not very large exposition about Korean culture or history but noticed that weekends have several cultural performance shows in front of the main gate"
39,3.0,"Worth a short stop, but sadly you're not going to learn a huge amount about Korean culture or history that you possibly didn't already know (and that's assuming that you don't know much to begin with). It's well put together with nice-looking artefacts, but is a tad superficial."
40,3.0,Free entrance. Overcrouded on holidays and weekends. Could be interesting for families with children. Visit to the National Folk museum could be combined with your visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace.
41,4.0,Most interesting museum I been to while I was there. Many displays and exhibitions that are very enriching to see and learn. Learned so much about the culture and I recommend a visit if you planning to go to the Gyeongbokgung palace as the museum is located within the vicinity.
42,5.0,"Free entry (really the only reason I agreed, not having a great deal of enthusiasm for it initially). Really glad we did - plenty to see, lots of photo opportunities and interactive displays. Well worth a visit"

44,4.0,"The museum is far away from the city, but we can get in here by using the bus or taxi.There a place, how the folks makes the kimchi as a traditional appetizers and etc"
45,4.0,"So many things you can see from the history of Korea right in front of you. Internet available and you can find explanations about the items in your phone. The only thing I didn't like was that there were too many replicas, I thought I would be seeing only original"
46,5.0,"you would have to spend a fair amount of time here to see it all, but even if you limited your  time here, visit at least one of the 3 exhibition halls. The museum is on the palace grounds."
47,4.0,"The museum is a comprehensive history of the culture and customs of Korea.  One could spend a couple of days there to view every exhibit in detail, and a minimum visit should be for at least four hours to do it justice."
48,5.0,"We were going through the Gyeongbokgung Palace when we came across the National Folk Museum of Korea. Especially during a cold winter day, it was fun to go in and see the exhibits. The free admission made it even better!"
49,4.0,"This museum is accessible from inside the Gyeongbokgung palace complex, and is free. It's definitely worth a visit. To be honest, if there's anything wrong with it, it's that there is TOO much information. It basically tells the entire history of the Korean people and their culture. It's kind of hard to take everything in, but it's a valuable place to learn some Korean history."
50,4.0,Informative even though certain displays do not have English explanation.  Within the vicinity of Gyeongbokgung Palace and it is free.
51,4.0,We were not able to spend much time here but found it very interesting and the exhibits were excellent.
52,5.0,"We loved this museum. The recreated homes throughout the ages were excellent. It is a small enough space that you can wander through all of the exhibits and get a good sense of life over time in South Korea. There were school groups galore. The kids were having a blast looking at the displays and interacting with us. Made for a lovely time. Especially enjoyed the section at the end which featured Wisdom. Interviews about elders,  the changes they've seen and how they wish to not be forgotten people in the community. Very moving stories and a well done exhibit. This was one of the best things that we experienced during our visit. I would gladly return."
53,5.0,if you are only in Korea a few days to miss this wonderful attraction would most defiantly be your loss  plenty s room a lot to see the Seoul palace doesn't look big out side don't let it fool you you have to take the time a day would be great and walk through those gates and a new world will open up great for kids it's not that expensive and worth the money I have been in plenty of korean museums they have the same thing see this museum and you seen the others except this one beats them all out
54,3.0,"If you are in the palace, give it a go, the demonstration of Korean peoples wedding and coming of age ceremonies is intresting"
55,5.0,"We opted for getting the audioguide, which was a great idea, as it automatically plays information about what you're standing in front.The museum itself is done up very well and is modern and interactive enough to keep your attention. Definitely plan for being here at least an hour.Also not to be missed: The remade old style looking street built outside. The attention to detail paid here as amazing and really gave me a great idea of how it was like to live in Korea decades ago."
56,5.0,Took the free guided tour of the National Folk Museum and found the different exhibits interesting and informative. The volunteer guide explained to us in detail the different sections of the museum and significance of various items and displays. A wonderful presentation of history and culture.

59,4.0,"Very intersting museum to know more about the people, culture and history. There are three galleries and the entrance is free. As it's near the palace, it could be crowded with tourists though.."
60,4.0,"The museum was situated at one of the gates of the palace.If you've bought a ticket for touring the palace, the price included free visit to this museum which is a great bonus.We enjoyed our time there. I'm especially impressed with the love and care they put into the design of the various display halls, including a complete replica of the older style of Korean dwelling which sadly not many left in the city itself.A good appreciation of Korean history and culture."
61,5.0,Allow more than an hour to see the many rooms as you walk through the history of this fascinating country. There are a number of rooms giving an idea of the daily life of Koreans.
62,4.0,"spent about 1-2hrs in the museum, educational, many people may not realise there is a small children park and some olden days deco on the other side"
63,4.0,"Good museum with a lot of interesting facts about Korea and the Korean people. Admission is free. Make sure to visit Gyeongbokgung palace at the same time, since it's at the same place. Keep in mind that the museum and palace is closed on Tuesdays. Visit on a weekday to avoid the crowds."
64,4.0,"Seoul is a mixture of the new blending with the traditional and the last, like most cities, but the contrast can be quite stark. The main city has wide streets and modern shops, the folk music looks at the cities past - certainly before the Korean War. The rooms depicting the 1980s houses were interesting as when I first looked they were more like 1950s Britain. There is no mistaking the major leaps in it and housing made over the last 40 years. The museum balances this beautifully. There is plenty of space to explore the exhibits and the outside exhibits - including the coffee shops barbers and printing houses are excellent."
65,5.0,This museum is absolutely beautiful. This is a must visit place if you want to see the beauty of Korean traditional culture.
66,4.0,There was a nice cafe on the ground floor. Many animations were displayed inside the museum. An old korean cottage outside was also one of interesting

68,5.0,"Museum is free and can be visisted through the Gyeongbokgung palace gardens. The interesting part is the reconstituated scenes of everyday life of the past. As usual in Korea, there is a special room for children. I enjoyed the whole thing very much. To be done at the end of the day after visiting the palace."
69,2.0,"We strolled along the palace and the museum gate are connecting to one another, so we decided to take a look inside the museum. At 16:30 hrs we wanted to get back into the palace because we want to see the small pavilion at the end of the palace, but the museum closed the connecting door at that time and doesn't allow us to go back in to the palace which the palace open until 17:00. So we forced to leave the museum and the palace at east gate."
70,5.0,"Truly enjoyed our visit to this museum, complete with a free English tour, a show and some interesting displays like the ancient funeral carrier and traditional Korean dress and utensils.  A great place to learn more about South Korea's rich history and culture."
71,5.0,"If you only go to one museum in Seoul make it this one! This museum was really cool. You got to see how people lived, you could walk into old Korean style ho,Es of the poor and the wealthy. It's interactive and detailed. You can learn how kimchi is made and how there are hundreds of varieties. A great way to get immersed in Korean culture for a day!"
72,5.0,"Museums are usually boring places to go, however this one is different. It showcases a lot of Korean culture dating way back and also detailed explanation of everything. It's a huge place too, so you can spend a lot of time here. This year they have the Monkey exhibition as a honor to the Year of the Monkey. Do drop by after your visit to the palace"

76,4.0,"Great museum, very culturally enriching! Totally recommend for fist time visitors. Not so big but their exhibits are worth the visit. Avoid rainy days and crowded days."
77,4.0,We came by here after the Palace and this was FREE on the same ticket.Plan on about 2 hours to see everything. Wear comfy shoes or sneakers. Not many places to take a break so you will be on your feet a lot. Clean restrooms.The best part of the entire museum was the exhibit on Kimchi...it appeared to be a hit with locals and travelers alike! Very informative. We learned much as this modern museum. We really enjoyed it.
78,4.0,"First of all, there are bathrooms here! After walking around that huge palace you will be thankful for this tip. Awesome art on display inside and out."
79,4.0,"The National Folk MuseumStopped by this museum while touring Gyeongbokgung & Changdeokgung Palace. Informative and has some good exhibits, my particular favourite being the birth to death exhibit of a Korean citizen. They have an excellent children’s museum attached which doesn’t have much in English, but is worth checking out with kids if you have the chance. The old village exhibit is also very nice to walk through."
80,5.0,Very nicely laid out museum in a gorgeous park. Good to combine with the palace in same park. Also has a children's part of the museum so that the children can have more fun at the museum while they learn. Has a cafe and a gift shop

82,4.0,"It’s a very remarkable place, if the weather is great you can enjoy much more spending more time here. We did not take guided tour here so what we stopped and read was all we gathered and of course great photos. The Building in the centre of the premises is awesome for picture from all angles. This place is interconnected with the Palace premises.Highly recommended, I loved this place, old houses, village kind of set up around, thought-provoking!"
83,5.0,l think that everybody came to Korean should be come here to visit and research cultural of Korean . Here was very valuable for traveller to discovery some national cultures . Most of things shown in here very attractive and make us amazing.
84,4.0,It was a great location. Gyeongbokgung Palace just next to the museum. Surrounding by lots of fruit trees and plants. A good tourism spot and good for picnic.
85,4.0,"The folk museum was amusing, fun and a worthwhile visit since it is free with a ticket to the palace. It carries tid bits on village life, Korea of old and how things were done in various villages and provinces. There are even little houses behind the museum, replicas of what people used to once live in.I'd recommend visiting this before going an extensive tour of the palace when you're a little less tired and sun exposed (it can get very hot in October) to read through the descriptions."
86,2.0,This was a free museum attached to the main palace site.  Lovely building but displays were uninspiring and very little to get excited about....but it was free and there was enough English labelling (and free booklet) to make things understandable.  Good place to visit for an hour if wet.
87,4.0,"Part of a day tour. We hurried through this and it was pretty interesting. Korea has a very colorful past. If you have a chance to actually listen and hear and take it in, it's interesting!"
88,4.0,"A must do if visiting Gyeongbok Palace. Changing exhibitions, a sculpture garden and traditional Korean village offer plenty to explore. Entry is included as part of the Gyeongbok Palace ticket price."
89,5.0,"I love visiting folk museums and seeing the traditional culture of the country I a visiting. This museum did not disappoint! I really wished I had more time as the exhibits telling the story of the Korean people were fascinating. I loved learning about how kimchi is made, as well as the how major life events are marked.There's a separate children's area (hands-on activities) and an outdoor village that you should definitely see! They market it as the ""Seoul your parents knew"" and I guess that means people my age, although I either don't think I'm as old as I am  or I can't believe how the city has changed in just 30 short years! Now that I think about it, I'm saying both of the above. You won't be disappointed. There are also great bathrooms and a place for ice cream/beverages, as well as a nice resting lounge."
90,4.0,"Visiting the museum on Sunday and they are kids bazar, great place. seen the culture and story of Korea. The Museum was at the Gyeongbukgong area, so you must spend time when visit the palace. interesting for education."
91,4.0,We stumbled upon this museum while walking around the city.  There is some interesting art outside the main buildings and a cool mockup of what a traditional Korean street would look like in the past.  Worth a quick visit if you find yourself in the area.
92,5.0,Be prepared for at least a 4 hour trip through the history and art of Korea.  There is excellent description in English of all showcased items.  Covers all elements of Korean society .
93,5.0,"This is a great place to try your hand at traditional Korean arts.  You can try making a copy of a Korean Dramatic Mask, as well as experience an performance.  You can also take a dance lesson of Korean folk dancing to traditional music.  It's really fun."

95,5.0,"The National Folk Museum offers a glimpse of traditional Korea, with a recreation of a village.  Many days, visitors can see a real traditional wedding of a Korean couple.

99,4.0,"If one is interested in history and the culture of Korea, the place to visit is The National Folk Museum of Korea. It is located in the Gyeongbokgung Palace grounds and our group walked to the Museum which is a short distance away after visiting the Palace.Inside the museum there are thousands of artefacts representing all aspects of Korean folklife. The Korean people's way of life are shown here from prehistoric age to the Joseon Dynasty, from the traditional customs, rituals, weddings and funerals. Outside the museum, there are out-door exhibits such as statues of the 12 zodiac animal signs, a folk house, stone statues of Dongjaseok (deity statues) placed in temples or in front of a tomb, Buksu (korean totem poles) placed at entrance of village and temples and Muninseok (scholars) that are placed in tombs.One can become engrossed in all the artefacts displayed inside and outside the museum and can spend hours here! An enlightening and enriching experience!"
100,5.0,"We really enjoyed this museum. It doesn't pretend it's old - such as the palace, it just shows you something about the Korean culture. For us the better part was outside, the houses, the statues..."
101,4.0,"This museum located on Gyeongbukgung place ,and thicket to palace valid on museum.Many household items of traditional Korean houses,description of traditions like wedding ceremonies, harvesting etc."
102,5.0,"Nice building, adjacent to one of the palacesThey have audio available at the reception for 1,000KRW, you don't have to join a tour to understand what each exhibited item is. It was cool how the recording automatically recognise where you are, compared to having to follow the numerical order. Guests can be really noisy, there are marshalls who have to constantly remind guests to do not use their camera flash. I like this museum. I suggest you spend 40mins at least."
103,3.0,"If you have time and interested in the Korean way of life, this place warrants an hour. Some displays of how the people lived in the past, their costumes, food, marriage ceremony, burial etc."
104,5.0,"This museum was definitely an interesting experience. It is far from being the biggest museum and most people would actually think it was perhaps a bit too small but it did an egregious job. The culture and development of Korean people was very well laid out and there were quite a few interesting items on display. The life-size displays of a traditional Korean bukchon was also extremely interesting. All in all, a good and concise display of traditional Korean culture.Definitely would not recommend to go to just the museum, however. I would definitely suggest you visit the museum either if you are visiting the Bukchon district or if you are visiting the Gyeongbokgung Palace."
105,5.0,This museum is wonderful. It is laid out thematically and is easy to understand. The displays are well-done and the descriptions are excellent. I bought a lot of gifts for friends and family in the outstanding gift shop. Lots of inexpensively priced cards and bookmarks. They have things here that you will not find elsewhere. I know...I kept looking!
106,4.0,"This is an important museum if you want to get a good feel for the cultural history of Korea.  It includes displays on specific traditions such as kimchee varieties and preparation, traditional homes and kitchens, and aspects of traditional life such as 60th birthdays, weddings, funerals.  Many full scale exhibits and dioramas.  Things of interest for all ages. Our timing was good and we saw a traditional harvest dance performance at the entrance to the museum.  Lots of grand drumming and leaping about (see picts).  As with the other national museums, there is no admission charge.   I enjoyed this museum even on my third visit!"
107,4.0,We had a glimpse of Korean history. One would enjoy it more if you will spend more time there. No picture taking allowed so be ready with your photographic memory. Very interesting and it's worth the visit.

109,5.0,The Folk Museum is on the property of the Gyeongbukgong Palace. It's a nice look at the history and culture of Korea. There are clean water fountains inside if you need a drink.
110,4.0,The gardens where really pretty and some amazing buildings to have a look at. Was really busy and full of school kids when we went.
111,4.0,"We went on the guided tour of the museum and thought it was an excellent way to understand the history of Korea. Our guide asked us what we wanted to learn about and took us on a spiritual narrative or the Korean Peninsular. He also explained in detail about the history of the Korean language and then selected key features about Korean culture.I highly recommend taking a one hour tour ( ours lasted 90 minutes and there was just myself and my partner). We then spent some more time looking at the dioramas and displays but felt like the tour had given us a good summary of Korean life.There is an audio guide available as well for 1000won.The displays do have English labels and offer some insight as to the history, the development of society and also Korean life. There are a number of artefacts as well as dioramas. If you have children there is a children's museum.Facilities inside the museum include a small cafe serving drinks, snacks and ice cream. There is a museum shop with some interesting books including one all about kimchi. I enjoyed my time here as I felt I learnt a lot about Korea. On top of that it was free. You will probably need at least 90 minutes here."
112,5.0,"It's free, it's next to Gyeongbuk palace, and they have a lot of decent exhibits.  If you walk around the outside, they have many relics, statues, and even a ""culture street"" recreating life from the 1970s."
113,5.0,"Other reviewers have mentioned free which it is, but don't be confused with cheap. We believed the presentation of the exhibits was really top notch, using imagination and varying media to tell the stories. The building as time goes by will become a treasure for Korea, if it is not already. We found it a fun place considering the subject, recommended for young and old."
114,5.0,"The National Folk Museum of Korea is definately worth a visit, it's located near Gyeongbukgong Palace in the garden area to the rear, this museum like most in Seoul is free, it is well set out, most explanations are in English, there is a coffee shop and toilet facilities, you can spend a few hours here and enjoy every minute - well done to the Korean Government for another great tourist area, free and easily accessable"
115,4.0,"I would go early in a visit to learn about the Korean culture and history. It's is signed in English, so you don't need a guide.  It's free, which makes it a great deal"
116,5.0,If one wants to learn almost everything about South Korea one need not go any further than the National Folk Museum of Korea in Seoul.  The museum houses close to one hundred thousand artifacts to trace the rich history of the Korean people from pre-historic times through the late 14th Century and ending with the Joseon dynasty period in 1910.  The museum comprises three principal exhibition halls housing a majority of the exhibits.  Other exhibits are also displayed in an open-air format. The museum itself is located inside the Gyeongbokgung Palace grounds.  If one follows the exhibits in the museum it is easy to see how Confucius was such an influence on the Korean people.  Most present day Korean culture traces its roots to Confucianism.  Some of the displays are actual replicas of the original rice storage shelters and grinding mills.
117,4.0,"There are a lot of interesting displays about Korean life and plenty of information available on narrative boards by each item, in English.Some of the models look disappointingly cheap and tacky, but you need to see past/through this and understand what is going on.No chance to get bored as each section springs into life and takes you on a different journey.Combine with a visit to the Gyeongbokgung palace and you will be there for a good morning."
118,4.0,"I visited the Folk Museum right after visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace. Musuem is free and is interesting if your into history, tradition and ornaments."
119,3.0,The Museum was pretty nice in the sense it show how the Korean people has develop from nomadic to what they are today.  They also have a small blast to the past little walking area where it shows a street of how life was in Korea during the 70's.
