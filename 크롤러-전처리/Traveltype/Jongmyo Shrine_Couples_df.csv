0,3.0,"Guided tours in English, German, Chinese and Japanese are available at particular time slots. Guide services are included in the entry ticket. You can enter the shrine only at these time slots as part of a guided tour. Tours in English are at 10 am, 12 noon, 2 pm and 4 pm. We reached there close to 11 am and had to wait for more than an hour to get in. The  shrine is where memorial service for the deceased kings and queens are held. The rituals continue even today. Annually, a big ceremony is held. The buildings are very simple. None of the grandeur associated with royalty. Not many exhibits . Would not term this as a must visit place"
1,4.0,"Jongmyo shrine is a fascinating visit for anyone interested in Seoul’s history. You can only visit the shrine with a guided tour (except on Saturdays apparently) but the tour is included in the ticket price. The guide was passionate & informative & ensures to sensitive tourists to the meaning & customs of the shrine. The tour takes about 1 hour.  Definitely worth doing, especially if you don’t know a lot about Joseon customs & traditions."
2,3.0,Jongmyo Shrine is worth a visit if you are in the general area.. We were not able to enter the shrine.  For some this may involve more walking and steps than its worth.  It helps to have a guide--otherwise it is just a restful stroll..
3,4.0,"Not one of the ""must see"" places of Seoul, but if one is in the area it is interesting to visit the site where the ""spirit tables"" of the royalty and priviledged servants of the Joseon Dynasty reside. No, this is not a cemetary which is the final resting place for the body -- but rather the final resting place for their spirits."
4,3.0,"If this was all there was in the area then it would be great, but there are some very impressive “competitors” nearby. On a Saturday, the main halls were closed, leaving you with some nice greenery and walk. But after your first 5 shrines, you start to get quite discerning"
5,4.0,A nice quiet place that is one of Korea's World Heritage site. Join the guided tour for free. It is worth your one hour.
6,5.0,"We were there on a Thursday, and needed to be in a group with a guide. Walking freely throughout the park is only possible on week-ends.The 60 minutes visit was very interesting."
7,4.0,informative guided tour of this historical site which is rich in history and culture. location was serene and impressive. must visit.
8,4.0,"Walking through Seoul looking for somewhere to eat, we realised we were close to the Jongmyo Shrine; so we decided to go inside and take a look around as tickets are not expensive. Through the gates, there is a medium sized complex with several different religious buildings, all of which are explained on the helpful signposts in English, Mandarin, and Korean.There is a good amount of information available on the history of the place, and the significance to Korean history. The whole walk around took an hour or so; it was worth the ticket price, but seemed more of a nice diversion to us than somewhere specifically to go to. It’s a pleasant park with historic and cultural significance, more than any specific museum or attraction in itself."
9,5.0,Recommend to join the guided tour where alot of history and cultural perspective will be shared along the tour journey. It's simply amazing when you imagine what's happened here in the past few hundred years of time. Definitely worth any penny where the tix price is only cost 1000krw.
10,5.0,"Definitely worth the 1000 krw admission tickets. However your will need to join the tour to get in, except on Saturdays. Do take note of the tour language listed on the website, different tours at different timings. The walking tour is about 1 hour"
11,5.0,"Jongmyo Shrine is located in the center of Seoul, not far from Changdeokgung, and the subway Jongno 3-ga station. It is a very tranquil resort with very few people, because except Saturday tourists are only allowed to get in with the scheduled guided tour. There are 2-3 English tours each day. The earliest one is on 10 am. So do make sure of the tour schedule before arriving. Thanks to this policy, the tour experience is just excellent. The guide is a typical Korean lady in traditional Korean costume. Although her accent is not so authentic, the guide is good enough to let the tourists understand the background and the beliefs behind the shrine. The tour takes about one hour. It is not a rush. We walk easily around the shrine year, and have enough time to take photos,appreciate the surroundings, and feel the atmosphere. These make it the best experience through out our tour in Korea. Another noteworthy point is that the shrine are still performing its sacred role today; there are still praying ceremonies held here every year."
12,3.0,"Consider purchasing the royal palace pass that includes 4 palaces and the royal shrine for 10,000 (approx $8.80USD) and be sure to pick up the English brochure at the entrance.This property is on the UNESCO list of masterpieces of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity.There are tours offered in Korean, Japanese, English and Chinese.Weekdays and Sundays you can enter the shrine only if on a guided tour...Saturdays and the last Wednesday of each month you can visit it without a tour."
13,3.0,"Did a guided tour in English which helped a lot. Very serene place to visit. This is a shrine and so has a more sombre feel and vibe to other sites. Very large area to walk. Took one hour to do tour, but glad to do it and get an insight into the history and background to the Shrine."
14,1.0,"Visited the shrine on a rainy day in August 2018 and did not enjoy the English guided tour at all. First of all, the paths were quite muddy. Secondly, you cannot visit the shrine without being in a tour. Thirdly, most of the main buildings are closed and open only two times a year (sometime in May and November, I think). Fourthly, it is almost an impossible task to explain Confucianism in an hour guided tour and the guide said she wouldn’t even try to do so. This place is designated as a UNESCO site purely for historical reasons, nothing spectacular in here. Not very interesting unless you are into Korean imperial history. One positive thing I should comment on is the generosity of the Seoul heritage society. Admission was 1,000 KRW, but like Gyeongbokgung Palace, the fee would be waived for seniors (65 years or older) if you have a document (passport or driver’s) to prove your age - even for foreigners."
15,4.0,"This huge area with many buildings for kings and queens memorial, since it's very big, you don't see much tourist, which is a big change from most attraction, more relax as you walk."
16,4.0,"It's not as impressive as the bigger palaces in regards to the buildings but this shrine is well worth a visit, especially on days when you can freely roam the site. It's in the heart of the city but once inside it feels as if you're in a different world, hundreds of years ago."
17,5.0,"Although this was my fourth visit to Sth Korea, this was my first to Jongmyo Shrine and the first for my wife. What an amazing place of calm and serene step into nature and stunning architecture. This is a UNESCO World Heritage site and rightly so. Don't just walk through, take the time to sit and breathe in what the place has to offer but please respect to religious significance of the site and where they are sign that ask not to enter, please don't. The resting place of the spirit tablets of the kings, this place is deep and still the centre of Korea's most significant Jongmyo ceremonies. I am so glad we got the opportunity to visit."
18,3.0,"You can only get in to the Jongmyo Shrine Zone as part of a one hour guided tour.  1000krw.   (Except Saturdays.).   English tours were at 10, 12, 2 and 4.    If you need to kill some time,  the Gwangjang Market is only a couple blocks away.    The park setting is quiet, serene and somber.     If you’re interested in learning about Korean customs as they related to burials and mourning of dead kings and queens, this tour is for you.  If you’re looking for spectacular burial vaults and furnishings, look elsewhere."
19,3.0,"A friend and I took an English language tour of the Jongmyo shrine over the winter. It was a lovely, serene place and the tour was interesting. We got some beautiful photos of the historic buildings in the stark winter setting. I'm glad we visited but I found some of the other nearby temples and palaces more exciting. Our guide told us that in November and May they have two fantastic large festivals on the grounds of the shrine. It would probably be more fun to go during one of those times!"
20,5.0,We missed the last English language tour. The last Korean language tour was an hour later so we just waited and joined that one. Visitors have to be part of a guided tour every day they are open except Saturday. If you just want to see the buildings and don't care about the information provided by the guide it's okay to go on one of the other tours. Staff made sure we knew it was not an English language tour and gave us a brochure in English. We were expected to stay with the tour which was fine with us. It lasted about 40 minutes.
21,4.0,"You need to visit as part of a tour, so check out times before visiting.  It is also closed on Tuesday, unlike the palaces which are closed on Monday.Once inside it is a very serene area.  Hardly any people compared to the other tourist areas, so it is a much calmer atmosphere.  Architecture is great, makes for some great photos."
22,5.0,"The tour is 1 usd or 1000 won, last one hour  and the necessary first stop in visiting Seoul. The guides were very informed, less crowded andgave historical and religious tidbits that you won’t get in the palaces or shrines. I enjoyed it more than visiting anything else during my time in Seoul."
23,4.0,"We went there without any knowledge about tour guide.There are nominated days we can enter without tour guides, otherwise we must be with a tour guide in order to see inside.The tour are from morning to at around 5pm but each tour runs in different languages such as English, Korean, Japanese and so on.Not all languages go through at the same time, so I suggest to check the time of your language in advance.However the tour is so useful that we can understand deeper meaning of buildings and histories.As I remember, this one is nominated as one of cultural heritage of Unesco, so it will be more interesting!"
24,5.0,A highly interesting hour long guided tour around this wonderful heritage site. Thorougly recommended but make sure you check entry times and restrictions - for example tickets for guided tours in Korean are only allowed to be sold to Korean citizens even if you only want to view the buildings.
25,3.0,"Spacious grounds. But you are left to wonder what are inside those huge halls. Well, you can stand in the middle of those squares and imagine."
26,4.0,This is a good place to learn about Korean culture.  You need to join a tour to see it (except on Saturday). Go to the website to check out times for your language. It costs 1000 krw including the tour. You will learn lots if you are new to Korean culture like I was.
27,4.0,"Except for one day per week (Saturday I think) the tours are guided, around 4 per day in English. Worth the visit. Our guide was good, and explained plenty. This was very different to a temple tour. Unfortunately the 2 buildings containing the many VIPs' individual shrines are not open to the public! Good to hear the details of the place, and to see the buildings, but pity we couldn't see inside the main buildings."
28,5.0,"A spiritual experience to visit one of Korea's most sacred sites.  The English tour starts at 10am, so be there on time.  Very informative.  Not much to see, but the site itself and the shrines are full of history.  Tour took 70 mins, and it was a very touching, peaceful and thoughtful experience.  Highly recommended."
29,4.0,We went here on a very hot an humid July day.  If you go here any other day than a Saturday you have to take a guided tour.  They run every 20 minutes but are in 4 different languages so if you timing is off you could wait and hour and 20 minutes for a tour in your language.  We were lucky and turned up just 3 minutes before the english language tour. Might have rated a lot lower if I had had to wait for an hour.  Anyway interesting tour takes about 50 minutes.  Learnt a lot about Korean history
30,5.0,"I love guide service, that shows Korean would reserve the historical place for new generations. Guide will take you around the place, for English guide time every 10AM, 12PM, 2PM and 4PM.  For admission, I took the combination ticket (10,000W for 4 palaces and 1 shinre valid in 3 months). Transportation, take subway to Jongno 3-ga (Line1, exit11; Line3, exit8; Line5, exit8)"
31,4.0,After the palaces this can appear plain in comparison however it is an important site being the final resting place for the emperors. There is not much to see although the buildings and grounds are well kept. Worth a visit if you have time.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
32,4.0,"This is a Confusian shrine housing the spirits of deceased kings and queens of the Joseon Dynasty that is located within a peaceful garden.  We took a 1 hour English tour (tours are required most days) and it was quite good and provided some interesting insights into Korean history, beliefs and attitudes."
33,4.0,"The shrine is a truly serene place, which helps explain why the curators only want visitors there on guided tours (which are exceedingly good value at KRW1,000 and available without booking ahead). Otherwise you'd have hundreds of people tearing around the place, shouting, trampling across sacred areas and taking selfies every five feet. It's an hour very well spent in a location that helps you build a better understanding of what Korean cultural heritage is about. To be recommended."
34,4.0,A peaceful setting and a good way to learn some history of the Korean Joesen dynasty.  We found our English tour guide to be especially helpful.
35,4.0,"A great cultural attraction to visit that is located close to many other places. Entrance is extremely cheap at only 1000 won and there are free tours at regular times, just check the board on display."
36,4.0,The grounds & buildings are austere to go along with the whole concept of honoring the spirits of ancestors. A very peaceful place.
37,3.0,"...beware. You can't just turn up. You need to buy a ticket for a timed, guided tour. The guide was very informative but I'm afraid after 2 weeks in Seoul I was a bit culture-blind and didn't really appreciate it."
38,5.0,"Excellent English language tour but beware only operates 3 times per  day. Knowledgable tour guide , and interesting way to spend an hour."
39,2.0,"Went here on a guided tour.  Grounds are peaceful, but not much to see.  This is supposed to be a peaceful place, lacking color.  If there's anything else on your list, I would skip this."
40,4.0,"Yes, it's quiet and yes, it's not a palace - but Jongmyo is still in use 1x a year (May) for a ceremony honoring the imperial Joseon ancestry which was designated by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. Really pretty stunning, even during the winter months. Would recommend visiting with a guided tour, but not necessary. If you go - don't want on the center path: it's reserved for the spirits (and the whole thing was built for them)!"
41,5.0,Plan your visit! This place is only open at set times when the guide can take you around. You are not allowed to roam around by yourself as it is sacred. There are a few times in the day that the guide is given in english or another language. The information from the guides is really useful and we appreciated it as we went around seeing the shrine. A place I'd recommend to koreans as well as foreigners.
42,5.0,"The place can only be visited with guided tours during the week and I highly recommend the visit. I went there in the last English tour of the day (around 4PM) and was able to take some great shots during the beginning of the golden hour. The tour explains several details not only about the shrine itself but also from Korean history, I enjoyed a lot and can't recommend enough a visit here."
43,5.0,"I personally liked this place than KyungBokGung  palace. Our English guide was great. It is very historical and beautiful. And it was only 1000 won. Just check the time table of tours when you visit. They have Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese. Even locals can't go in without the tour guide."
44,4.0,"Nice temple and garden area, entrance less then a euro, with english guide lasting a good hour.Area is very nice and part of the korean history, the path of spirits inside was interesting."
45,4.0,"We took the 2pm tour on October the 20th and we had a guide that was fluent in English which was a great help to understand the history and use of the buildings. Visits are only permitted with the guide. The shrine is dedicated to the member of the royal family of the Joseon dynasty. The main building is very long and has 19 chambers where the tablets of the teaching of the kings are enshrined. This place is a highly recommended, and the access to this shrine can be bought together with other monuments by getting a Royal Palace Pass."
46,4.0,"Jongmyo is the old royal ancestral hall. Many Eastern Asian countries have their own version of royal jongmyo (called Tai miao or zong miao in Chinese) including China and Vietnam. The Seoul jongmyo is not the biggest, however, it's the only one that is still in use.  The descendants of the last royal family still comes twice every year to perform the traditional ancestor worshipping ritual. The ritual disappeared in most eastern asian countries. The ritual is open to public, unfortunately I missed it by a week."
47,5.0,"We stumbled across this place, as one of the palaces we wanted to see was closed that day. And we weren't disappointed!We would highly recommend catching a tour here, to explain everything for you - so interesting and the guides are very informative - really well worth the visit. Just don't walk on the stone roads inside the shrine!"
48,5.0,"Beautiful place full of asian history. Admission price is just 1,000 KRW. Close to Insa-dong as well."
49,5.0,One of the things I admire so much about Asia in general is the respect for ancestors.  This whole shrine is a memorial for prior kings.  The grounds are beautiful and peaceful.  The buildings are lovely.  The English tours are about 3 times per day.  This shrine is only accessible with their tour.
50,5.0,You cannot freely go there and roam around. You must be guided. Check the time for your language tour you prefer and show up within half hour. It is because it is a shrine for the dead kings that its sanctity must be respected.
51,3.0,"Having visited the palaces and had a lot of time to explore, we were hoping to take our time while visiting the shrine. Unfortunately access was only through a guided tour, though on our ticket it said there were no guided tours on Saturday. I don't know if this means that it is closed or you can go through the area on your own. The tour was about an hour long. The guide gave us some information but it seemed rather rushed and wasn't clear which is why we rated it a little lower than other attractions."
52,4.0,"This shrine is a world heritage and cant be accessed by individuals, and you should join a tour to enter, the tour is free and is a MUST. The details and delicate points of the ceremonies in this shrine reflects the difference and mentality of Korean culture. Enjoyed a lot and oh by the way, dont step on the spirit's pass!"
53,3.0,A pleasant enough spot and worth a visit as it plays a significant role in Korean cultural identity. However you have to take a tour which only happens every 2 hours so if you miss one you will be waiting around. Not a highlight of any trip to Seoul but worth an hour of  your time.
54,3.0,"Not great but nice, note that you can not walk around by yourself but have to wait for a tour, tours are offered in different languages at different times.Worth to spend 1000 wons and about 20 minutes"
55,3.0,"We visited the shrine on Friday an hour before closing time. We were not aware of the mandatory tour guide until read on TA now. Back then, we were allowed to walk freely, but the doors of the shrines were all closed. So we were not impressed at all, more like walking in the park. Think better to join a tour guide next time.."
56,4.0,"This is probably the largest Shrine in Seoul, and we visited it as part of a group ticket for 10,000Won with all of the major Palaces.  That said, by itself, this is one of the cheaper ones to visit by itself (1,000Won).All of the Palaces and Jongmyo are in pretty much the same area, and accessible by the metro.But the trick to visiting the Shrine - and the reason for my heading - is that most times you can't just rock up and expect to stroll around by yourself.  In most of the Palaces, you can.  We didn't appreciate that as we hadn't done our homework.  You can only wander around by yourself on a Saturday and on the last Wednesday of every month.  Otherwise, you must be on a guided tour (Korean, Japanese, Chinese or English), and they only run a set number of times a day.  We turned up only to find we had to wait an hour and a half for the next English tour.Hmmm.  ""Can we join the Chinese tour that leaves in half an hour?"".  ""Can you speak Chinese?"". ""Not very well"" (by which I meant I can order a number 7, 23, 27 and fried rice off a Chinese takeaway menu).  Nevertheless, they let us join the Chinese tour and the guide asked me the same questions.  We just weren't allowed to leave the group.  Of course, we couldn't understand the commentary, but we had the brochure and many signs were in English.  So we got to see the Shrine - better than waiting for the English tour or not seeing it at all!"
57,5.0,"Not spectacular but beautiful park. Worth the trip. many buildings to be visited: temples, pagodas, etc..."
58,2.0,"We went there and though it is a waste of time. You cannot walk inside the building, some rooms are open to look from outside. not recommended"
59,4.0,"If you want to visit the UNESCO Jongmyo Shrine, visit it during Saturdays. On Saturdays, tourists are not required to get a guide inside. In addition, you'll be able to experience the Buddhist ritual held inside the shrine."
60,4.0,"Jongmyo Shrine (₩1000 per person) is one of the UNESCO World Heritage areas in Seoul that makes for a nice place to visit if you are interested in seeing historical buildings from the Joseon Dynasty. Note: Visitation are subject to guided tours only during the week. However, you can visit independently on Saturdays.Here you will find Confucian style shrine complexes which were used for memorial services for deceased kings and queens of the Joseon Dynasty who ruled Korean from the late 14th century until the end of the 19th century.  The Jongmyo Shrine grounds include four main clusters of buildings which you can browse around. Most are not open to view inside but you can appreciate the symmetry of their design and layout as well as the significance of their presence here. As you walk around there are a few opportunities to glimpse into open halls, allowing you to view panelled paintings and shrine altars. Throughout, you will find signage at important walking path junctures, providing details regarding the shrine buildings in front of you. Note: Visits during autumn means that you can see the shrine buildings during the fall foliage, providing lovely colour to time spent at Jongmyo Shrine."
61,3.0,for most European people it will be rather little underwhelming; Closed on Tuesdays. You can enter only with a guide.
62,3.0,"We went on a Sunday hoping to visit this shrine, but ended up looking for the entrance in the wrong direction and walked around the entire block before finding the entrance near where we started (but in the opposite direction). Circling the entire block took us around 40 minutes. When we tried to purchase tickets, the lady told us ""no"" with an explanation in Korean. Reading the sign, we realized that unless you visit on Saturday, entry is only allowed with a tour, and there are set tour times. We arrived around noon and had missed the 11:30 am English tour, and the next English tour was at 1:30 pm, so we ended up abandoning our visit to Jongmyo. Plan your visit carefully!"
63,4.0,"Don't expect big attraction, this place is not about that, If you are interested in Joseon era, you appreciate this sacred and peaceful place. The entrance ticket only 1000won, but you can only enter with a guided tour."
64,3.0,"With all of the wooden doors holding the invaluable King/Queen Tablets closed except during the once per year Festival, not really that much to see, since the buildings themselves are intentionally 'low-keyed' -- i.e. designed for 'solemnity'.  Much better to see the Changdeok-gung Palace and other sites."
65,5.0,"This shrine is a royal shrine. It is very serene and tranquil. There's only guided tours available on weekdays. The English tours are at 10am, 12pm, 2pm, 4pm. Do take note if you are looking to make a trip so you won't have to end up waiting. The shrine is located at the Jognno 3-ga station. Accessible via the blue and orange metro lines. The shrine is one station away from the Anguk station where Insadong is. So if you like, you could cover 2 places at the same time."
66,4.0,"You can only visit the shrine if you take a guide which only cost us 1,000 won. The gardens are beautiful but this was never meant to be enjoyed for the living - it is a place for the spirit tablets, a place for spirits. So it's not even a tomb. The guide gave us a nice insight into the history and I was happy to have been able to visit this UNESCO site."
67,5.0,You need a guide to do a tour here as its so big and you won't really know any of the history if you don't . There are paths and stones you are not allowed to walk on as its for the spirits so be very careful not to disrespect the rules
68,5.0,"This place is a world heritage site, however, this place is not a touring site. So I recommend this place only for those who understand (or try to understand) that this is a shrine, and that ""this place is THE MOST IMPORTANT SHRINE of CHOSUN DYNASTY"". There is no particularly big, or  fantastic architecture here. Although main building is very unique for those in architechture, for most of us, it is just a one-storied building. For those who try to understand Korean confucianism, culture, history, this place has a very high priority. But you are not such an individual, there are other places to visit."
69,2.0,"This is not suppose to be a tourist spot to begin with if you ask me. It is a royal shrine for all the deceased kings and queens (actually just the tablets), but none are not opened to public viewing."
70,4.0,"I feel a bit bad about not giving gushing adjectives about this very nice, historical shrine.  It is well- maintained and quite elaborate, but it is quite similar to many shrines around Asia.  Our benefit was going the last Wednesday of the month, allowing us to walk about the place at our own pace.  The best parts were the semi-open historical items to see and the photo-op area with people in character (? priests for tablet rituals).  I would still say it's worth the visit (and knock out your shrine list all at once)."
71,5.0,We were not allowed to tour unguided except on Saturdays. Joined the 4.30pm tour after the secret garden tour at another palace. Tour guide speaks really good English. Really worth the visit.
72,5.0,A very nice park and shrine to spend an hour touring. The guide explains the traditions and spiritual tablets.
73,5.0,"Coincidentally, our trip to Seoul and Jongmyo coincided with 'The First Royal Cultural Festival - Today, We meet the Palace'. We went to Jongmyo on Friday 1st May and paid for entrance as normal - the complex is impressive with the 2 main Halls and other smaller buildings. We learned that the festival started 'tomorrow' so after looking around the complex we returned the next day for the start of the festival at Jongmyo. There was a procession starting outside the walls that came inside the complex and went on to ceremonies at the main halls. Today there was free entry and we were able to get a good vantage place and watch the procession. Not really understanding the nuances of all the costumes etc. it was a great show. It was a coincidence which added to the enjoyment. I expect that this festival will be held every year so look out for it in the May time frame as it also relaxes the rules for sightseeing in other Palaces etc."
74,4.0,"While you do need to go on a tour to visit, it only costs 1000 won and is about an hour long.  The English tours are at 10 am, 12 pm, 2 pm and 4 pm.  The tour was quite interesting and, even though we didn't have the freedom to explore as we would have liked, the guide did give us some room to roam a little.  The buildings are unique and I have not seen anything like them in my travels.  I write about temples and these structures are certainly pretty unique."
75,4.0,Took an hour-long tour of this shrine and found the history to be very interesting.  We were told this was one of the few places not destroyed during the Japanese occupation period.  Suggest you try to determine when the ceremonies are being held here by the former royals and observe their traditions.  We only saw pictures on the tour.
76,4.0,"There are a few slots for the guided tours under different languages and it is a must to book the tour to enter this sacred place. Very interesting to learn about the shrine, amongst the main palaces in the area."
77,3.0,"Except for one or two days, most days you need a guide to see the place. And except for 2 days in a year where they have a special ceremony to honor their monarchs, there's really nothing much to see. Just a long building with closed doors. The tour is quite informative but that aside, there's nothing to see."
78,5.0,"Very interesting shrine and surrounds. As we were there on a Saturday, our visit was self guided. This UNESCO heritage site is well worth the visit as it is said to be the resting place of the spirit tablets of korean kings and queens."
79,4.0,"Jongmyo Shrine is one of the most beautiful things to visit in Seoul. You need to follow a guide (there's one in English, one in Chinese and one in Japanese) in order to understand the Confucian view on life that inspired the construction of the shrine. Make sure you check the time of your guided tour (which is for free).There is the possibility of renting (for free) strollers and wheelchairs."
80,5.0,We went to the door and noticed that this place offer guided tour only on normal days. And they don't allow walk in individually. The guided tour is actually quite good on explaining things around the different houses and tombs.
81,5.0,"Only 1000 won to get in but you can only visit with the guided tour.  Arrived about 10:07 and they still let us in and told us to catch up to the tour.  The tour guide was extremely informative and explained the history of the shrine.  Learned a lot more than we ever would have if we could have done this self guided.  In Dec 2013 when we went the front was all under construction but the Shrine is still open behind it, so don't be deterred by the construction in the front."
82,5.0,Great place to learn about Korean culture and belief about the dead. Simple yet elegant grounds. It snowed on the day we visited so it was especially beautiful. Very informative tour. The official website is not extremely helpful in terms of tour schedule. We went according the the website but found out that they posted new/different schedule at the entrance. Still worth a visit!
83,4.0,"Most of the week this shrine is only open to tours.  The tours are free, but there are restrictions on certain tours, based on your language and residence.  For most tourists this will not matter.  For example, the English language tour is not available to Koreans.  We were lucky this day, as we arrived at 1400h, just after the English tour had started.  The entry guard, after briefly asking us if we were Korean (No, we are not), allowed us to join the tour.  As with our previous Palace and Secret Garden guides, this guide had excellent English, and their personal portable speakers projected loudly enough to be heard in a large group, without it being excessively noisy.The temple grounds are large and very leafy, but there are few buildings here, compared with the palace complexes.  The buidlings, however, are on a grander scale.  Following the cultural revolution in China, these are also the world's oldest extant Confucian devotional sites.  The foci of the complex are the two large spirit falls, where Korean monarchs to pay homage to their illustrious ancestors back to the founders of their dynasty.  Housing is also found for the less illustrious monarchs.  Touchingly we are told that these less famous kings often did not have opportunity to shine socially, administratively, or martially, due to a short life or a short reign, yet their spirits are still respected all the same.  The spirits of the last of the Korean Joeson dynasty, still using the Palace complexes till the late 20th Centure, are also housed here.Traditional Korean music is performed on the 1st Sunday of the month, but we did not get an opportunity to see this on this occasion.Well worth a visit."

Jongmyo is for the deceased. As such, it turned out to be a much more interesting tour than I expected. Similar to the Secret Garden at Changdeokgung, you can only enter Jongmyo as part of the scheduled tours. I believe there is a limit to the number of people who can be in there at once.As a side note, the small park outside the entrance is worth strolling through. You'll find all sorts of older gentlemen playing Go (or Baduk as it is called in Korea) and Xiangqi (Chinese Chess). As a fan of board games (and Go in particular), I appreciated seeing this."
