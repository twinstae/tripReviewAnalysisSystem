0,5.0,"I visited 2 palaces (Deoksugung & Gyeongbokgung) during my visit to Seoul last month. 'though Deoksugung is not as big as Gyeongbokgung, but Deoksugung is quite unique compare to Gyeongbokgung. You can find both Joseon Dynasty & Western influences in this palace, something that you can't see in another palaces in Seoul .."
1,4.0,"I've been here a few times over the years and it never disappoints. I love the fact that it has a changing of the guard ceremony (3 times a day I think) and other stuff going on too. Once inside though it feels like a different world with a park like ambience plus a mixture of Korean and Western architecture which makes it unique for a Korean palace. I like to just sit and watch the world go by here.I walked here, but it's close to City Hall metro station if you're using the underground."
2,4.0,"Interesting collection of traditional Korean architecture (e.g., Daehanmun Gate, Junghwajeon Hall, etc), a fusion of Korean and European architecture in Jeonggwanheon Hall, then more classical European in Seokjojeon Hall and the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (both fronted by a European garden).  All overlooked by the high rise buildings of modern Seoul!  I relatively small complex, easy to traverse in 60 or 90 minutes, but the architectural contrasts are a highlight.   Along with the changing of the guard!  11am, 2pm, and 3:30pm.  Noisy, colorful and informative - really well presented, and plenty of photo opportunities at the end."
3,4.0,"This palace opening hours are 9am to 9pm. I visited this palace just before 6pm, initially hoping to stay until dark to capture the compound with its lightings. However, the palace is rather small, with only 6 buildings in total. As such, I spent only an hour here and left, not willing to wait till sunset around 8pm.The buildings architecture and design are generally the same as other palaces. One unique building is Jeonggwanheon Pavilion, built by a Russian architect, incorporating Korean and Western designs. This pavilion was used for banquets for foreign visitors when they visited the palace."
4,4.0,"I went there after being rather unhappy with a museum visit. This place saved the day as it was a wonderful way to learn about more recent Korean history and understand how things moved there. The mixture of old traditional style Korean architecture with what came to be more fashionable once Korea was influenced by the west is a interesting sight to observe. By all means that time to sit and watch, observe the landscape.Though I did find it annoying that for the museum you needed to buy an extra ticket, so I didn't go."
5,5.0,"A high school student called Esther who is my volunteer guide made the trip perfect. She was able to explain about the different buildings, meaning of motifs and emblems, and story of the Princess. Weather is very good in June with sun and nice temperature. Just in time to catch the change of guards after my tour. Best experience, thank you!"
6,4.0,Famous for its stone wall road and located at Seoul's busiest downtown intersection. You can watch the changing of guards ceremony here and don't forget to try walking on th4 stonewall walkway path.
7,4.0,"...Gyeongbokgung Palace which I thought to be rather bleak (maybe stark). Then again maybe it was because I was on a tour there, and here  I was on my own.  Changing of the Guard Ceremony seemed more intimate here with everyone invited to take pictures with the guards.  I liked the Museum of Modern Art located on the grounds though there was nothing modern about the art at all. I didn't see anything less than a hundred years old in the place."
8,5.0,"I seriously fell in love with the palaces in Seoul. This one is definitely definitely recommended to visit. The only palace where you can observe the King’s throne closely. Even though it’s pretty small compared to other palaces, it’s still beautiful. One of the building isn’t painted like other buildings, it’s said that the Emperor Gojong lived there when he’s old and passed away at that exact building. There’s a mixture between western and eastern architectures here. I will come back for sure and maybe will try to book a tour for the Daehan empire history museum ( the only building with western influences where Emperor Gojong used to live and entertain guests)."
9,5.0,"Deoksugung is the only palace in Seoul where you can experience being a Royal Palace Chief Gatekeeper and take an active part in the Changing of Royal Guards Ceremony (not just as a spectator). Unlike other palaces, you can also enter the palace grounds at night to enjoy a moonlit stroll. Currently, an exhibition of costumes and accessories from the K-drama Mr. Sunshine is being held in the palace. Beyond the palace, you can explore the historic neighborhood and the famous Stonewall Walkway along the palace walls. You can find film locations from K-dramas like Goblin. Find more tips on how to enjoy this palace and its neighborhood here -> http://bit.ly/DeoksugungTips"
10,3.0,"I liked Deoksugung the least of Seoul's five grand palaces. That's because its myriad buildings present a mishmash of neoclassical Western and traditional Korean architectural styles. A palace since 1593, Deoksugung took on a new look in the early 1900s when King Gojong instituted a program of modernization and reform. In addition, during my October visit, a wall enclosed a large portion of the grounds, further detracting from a cohesive whole. Construction work was under way, with windows in the wall revealing only dirt and construction materials. I found the buildings interesting to look at separately, especially Jeonggwanheon Hall, a fusion of Western and Korean. The king drank coffee here and entertained guests. This small structure features a verandah and metal railings and fits in better with the Korean halls than with the massive  Western buildings. One of the latter  now holds the Daehan Empire History Museum and another features the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art. I came here on a weekday to watch the changing of the guard at the entrance gate and stayed to visit the palace itself. The guard ceremony proved to be absolutely spectacular with at least 50 participants dressed as Josen-era soldiers and bandsman in vivid yellow or brilliant shades of purple. The ceremony lasted about 10 minutes with a woman describing what was happening over a loudspeaker in English and other languages. She then invited spectators to approach the soldiers to take photographs. Excellent free brochures about the palace are available in English. Information signs, most with details in English, exist throughout the complex, and tours are available in English. The admission fee for adults is 1,000 KRW (about $1 U.S.)."
11,4.0,This place is huge and take your own time in exploring these palace grounds. Good for a leisurely walk. It has many Palace buildings and a beautiful Garden.
12,5.0,I was walking by so I stopped in. Nice buildings and grounds and a very low entry fee. I was fortunate to see the changing of the guard on my exit.
13,4.0,I think I might’ve missed the event. I only saw two guards at the gate and they look quiteordered. Enjoyed the visit and it’s nice grounds is that it’s under construction at the moment. Pretty buildings and peaceful
14,4.0,A walk around the old and new buildings of this palace is a perfect escape of the city as well as an education on architecture and art. Please note it is closed on Monday and Tuesdays.
15,5.0,"beautiful in fall, if you go to city hall definitely go here! changing of the guard is also very good to watch and they let you take pictures with them :)"
16,3.0,"It’s smaller than Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung, and Changgyeongung but still interesting. The location is near the Seoul City Hall. The most interesting things are the changing guard time and palace festival (usually around May or October). But for the other months, it’s not that worth it to be visited."
17,5.0,"Although smaller than the other palaces this place is packed with charm.The changing of the guards happens a few times in the day (I went at 11) and they allow photos up close with them at the end of the ceremony. Buy yourself a 10,000 combo ticket to let you into all the palaces Closed on Monday"
18,5.0,"Deoksungung palace is a must to visit if you come to Seoul. Read little bit of history about the place that it will be easy for you to understand the details when you visit. Wear comfortable dress and shoes that you will need to walk around comfortably.You can enjoy the change of gaurds show. There is a lot of things to see and enjoy. You can arrange for a a guide to take you around and explain the details,  but it is not necessarily. Wheelchaired persons can get access too. It is a charming place to visit and highly recommended"
19,4.0,The palace is not as big as the rest of the other palace around Seoul but the highlight is the Royal Guard Changing Ceremony that is showcase to tourist every day except Monday at 2 different timing (10am and 1pm). One can even take pictures with the guards when the tour facilitator told you to do so.
20,4.0,"Deoksugung is a small palace near Seoul city hall. Everything is compact, but perfectly conserved. If you don’t have enough time to go other palaces, to visit this one is recommend. It takes about one hour and the entrance is free. The location is very convenient."
21,4.0,"This palace is far less tacky than the other palaces in Seoul, where a large proportion of attendees dress in hangbok - traditional clothing for the art of selfie!The buildings are well kept and there has been replicas of thrones put in place to make the complex look more authentic. The main throne room overlooks the civil servants homage square (for want of a better description), with stone markers marking the position according to rank. An authentic replica musical band give performances - quite colourful and full of period nostalgia.A large bell and drum house and a landscaped pond with fountain is at the top end of the compound. There is a museum of modern and contemporary art within the palace complex and also a museum of the colonial administration.Superb architecture and very colourful. Well worth a visit. Allow 90 minutes without a visit to the art museum. Entry is W 1000, but and additional ticket required for the art museum. Nice coffee shop near to the entrance."
22,4.0,"Deoksugung, one of the five palaces of the Joseon Dynasty. This is a very small palace. However, the last king of Korea had a sad history as a place where he actually lived. The last king of Korea was the first Korean to drink coffee. I can see where he drank coffee."
23,5.0,"Peaceful palace and nice scenery just at city hall station. Take a walk to rest your eyes from all the commercial signs. The palace still in good shape, probably was rebuild just like other palace. If you looking for unique photos, consider the external wall surrounding the palace. Check time for performance at the main gate too."
24,5.0,"The Deoksugung Palace was the home of the king of the Joseon Dynasty and was used as a residence of Emperor Sunjung right up until his death in 1919. The imperial buildings have been restored to their former glory and gardens that are well maintained. Guided tours are also available fpr groups, or just couples if you book ahead on the Deoksugung website.The grand Western Seokjojeon Hall is architecturally splendid. I would have loved to have been able to make it inside had I made a reservation (only 5 people are permitted) at a scheduled time on a first come first serve basis. Through the windows the banquet hall looked like the set of 'Downton Abbey'. It makes for utterly gorgeous backdrop for landscape photography.Its highly recommended to watch the Changing of the Guard procession  outside the main palace gates at 11am, 2pm or 3.30pm. Its a ceremony with lots of drums, flag waving, marching and military formalities stretching back over hundreds of years. Afterwards tourists are welcome to come and take photos with the guards. Finally, a great little tip. Make sure you check out the Jeongdong Observatory, located next door to the palace in the Seoul City Hall Seosonum Annexe Building. From the observation deck (18th floor) you can capture panoramic views of the Deoksugung palace grounds, CBD skyline, City Hall grounds and other landmarks - and its Free! You'll get some amazing photos as a souvenir."
25,4.0,A small palace that is open until 9pm and has a stone wall with scenic ginko trees during fall season and a weekend market. It is set within walking distance from Myeongdong and has its 3:30pm changing of the guards that is quite unique and charming. They also provide english tours so check its website.
26,4.0,"The exchange of guards are extended up to the external side streets of the palace.  You can also enjoy the view from the top of the building (across Deoksugung) on weekends. How to get to Deoksugung Palace (덕수궁)Address: 99, Sejong-daero, Jung-gu, Seoul  서울 중구 세종대로 99Direction: Get off at City Hall Station (Seoul Subway Line 1 – Exit 2 / Seoul Subway Line 2 – Exit 12, turn left at the exit and walk straight for 30 meters)"
27,4.0,After my 16 hour flight and few hours sleep walking through a new city can be quite daunting but this was the best place I could have ended up the palace and buildings were lovely and there wasn't too many people. I was also there for the guards show which was also very entertaining
28,5.0,"Of the five palaces in the heart of Seoul, the Deoksugung is probably the most interesting, even if it's the smallest site. But come at night. It's open until 9:00PM and looks particularly interesting once it's floodlit under the night sky. Some of the pavilion's are actually accessible (unlike any of the other palaces) and there are art displays to view. Plus, the main pavilion has the doors open to spy the intricate ceiling. The only snag of coming at night is that the on site museum is only open until 5:00PM. Buy the Palace Pass (it's W10,000 for the five museums and the shrine) to get the best deal."
29,4.0,"Although I unfortunately missed the changing of the guard, it gave me the opportunity to visit this place at night where everything is beautifully lit. There was some music and a (traditional?) play was conducted. Ununderstandable for me, but fascinating nevertheless."
30,5.0,"It was very surreal for me to be walking along the same paths as many kings in the past. The buildings are truly impressive and certainly worth your time. A ticket to get in was 1,000 won, or a little less than a dollar. Soooo glad I came here!"
31,3.0,"This palace is near City Hall and costs W1000 to enter. It is closed on Mondays.There are free guided tours in English twice a day at 1030 & 1330.The palace was the home of two kings, the first in the 16th-17th centuries and then again in the 19th-20th centuries.The best building is the Throne room which has exquisite dragon carvings on the ceiling.Note that the complex houses the Seokjojeon Hall. Anybody can visit the basement - not much to see there, particularly if you can't read Korean. The best parts are the first and second floors. But you have to book on the site webpage in advance. Or for foreigners there is a special rule to allow up to five to sign up on a waiting list, first come first served. This hall was built in about 1910 and is a mixture of western and Korean styles. The hall is now the Daehan Empire History Museum and is definitely worth a visit. The visit is guided and should take about 45 minutes.Time to visit would be up to an hour, longer if you go into the hall."
32,4.0,"Located at the corner of Seoul's busiest downtown intersection, Deoksugung Palace is famous for its elegant stone wall road. It is also the only palace that sits along side a series of western style buildings that add to the uniqueness of the surrounding scenery. The Changing of the Guard can be seen in front of Daehanmun Gate and is very popular even for many visitors. Closed every Monday. Subway Line 1 and 2 City Hall Station Exit 1, 2 or 3."
33,4.0,"Stayed for a few days in the Plaza hotel which is just in front Deoksugung and was curious to know what is insideEntrance fee is quite affordable and you get a decent guide for the different buildings, however personally I enjoyed much more relaxing under the shadow of the trees just enjoying the view than learn about the history of the place"
34,4.0,"The palace was not too large, in compared with Gyeongbukgung or Changdeokgung, but it was easier to find as it was right out City Hall station and opposite the City Hall of Seoul. Half of the palace was as traditional as other palaces in Korea, but the other half was totally different with Western-style building, pond, fountain and garden that made me very impressed!"
35,5.0,This place is an absolute must when in Seoul. The walk in the park is refreshing and some of the temples/palaces are dating back two centuries ago. There are also some newer building that have been added in recent times.
36,3.0,There are many other palaces that are more with to visit I then this one. This one is nice but if only you have lots of time to kill in Seoul. Otherwise you can skip it. It cost 1000 won
37,4.0,"I actually tell visitors to visit Deoksugung instead of Kyeongbokgung many times. If you want to see a palace, this is a good starter palace to see. You will not be walking in wall to wall bodies like at Kyeongbokgung. You get way more bang for the won, so to speak.  I was pleasantly surprised by Deoksugung."
38,4.0,"Deoksugung palace is one of the five grand palaces built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty. This palace is smaller than for instance Changdeokgung Palace or Gyeongbok Palace, but really worth a visit. Entrance tickets are really cheap and the buildings on the palace grounds are an interesting mixture of Korean and Eastern style buildings. The Deoksugung palace is also the only palace which stays open in the evening. A visit in the evening is highly recommended, because the buildings are beautifully lit. If you're a photographer, don't forget to bring your tripod!"
39,5.0,"This was a lovely, well maintained palace & grounds. You can easily spend a couple of hours walking around, looking at the different buildings as the grounds are large. Very serene and peaceful even though it's in the city centre. I went early in the morning and avoided the crowds so got some great photos."
40,4.0,"This place is spotlessly clean, full of history, great palace and grounds. Takes a good 2 hours to do this properly. Great to see the changing of the guard and they are photo friendly, the cherry blossom was out.  Had a coffee at a nice place inside.  Well worth the walk."
41,3.0,"It's not expensive for the ticket and you can walk around, enjoy the old Korean style palace. It took me just 20 minutes to see them all (as well as going to the toilet on the other side of the palace)."
42,3.0,"The Admission: 1,000 wonThe Palace: Originally built during the Joseon period, one of the historic palace. It is situation between modern buildings, interesting to see the old and the new in the same place. Beautiful architecture, great for photo opportunity. There is also a western style garden fountain, nice place to sit down, relax and enjoy the view. The changing of the royal guard ceremony that takes place every day at the main gate. Definitely must-see. You don't need to buy admission ticket to see this because it is right outside the palace. The Subway Station: Exit 2 or 12 of City Hall Station (Subway Line 1 or 2)"
43,4.0,This is one of the most interesting Palace I have visited. History of it is good but the traditional and modern buildings within Deoksugung is more interesting. It shows how South Korea slowly learning from the western culture. Interesting place!
44,4.0,"As I have done most of the palaces, this one didn't have anything special, no must see factor until I went round the Historical Museum. This was the tick in the box for this Palace. The w1000 also includes the museum, and if you want to walk round head over as soon as you arrive and get yourself on a tour. It is access by tour only and they leave every 30 minutes, but gets full quick as the groups are only small. Shoes off and slippers on, they gave me an English audio so I could follow round, but obviously the passionate guide was giving the locals much more than I was hearing. All renovated in the last 10 years, but decorated as best as they could from old photos and with some of the original furniture. The history you get is the best thing and even some photos of the old emperors and emperoresses. Your 1000 doesn't also get you into the art gallery, that will cost you more."
45,5.0,This palace is downtown across from city hall.  They have a changing of the guard twice a day...don't miss it
46,4.0,"Being the ""smallest one"" among the four palaces I got to in Seoul (not sure how it compares in size with Gyeonghuigung which is the only one that I didn't get to among Seoul's five palaces), this is not a palace like Gyeongbokgung which is kind of ""a world of its own"" with its huge grounds where you'll get an ""immersion experience"" of the Joseon era days but what this palace offers ""just because of"" its significantly smaller grounds (compared to Gyeongbokgung) is nice ""contrasting views"" of traditional palace buildings & their modern high-rise counterparts right outside the confines of the palace grounds (including the interesting-shaped all-glass structure of Seoul City Hall which can be seen from the raised platform around the main palace building) which will kind of give you an idea ""how far"" Korea has come from those days of the Joseon Dynasty.  And those relatively small grounds of the Palace actually merge on one side (to the left of the main palace building while facing it, or equivalently to your right if you go all the way to the end of the pathway from the entrance gate after coming in from the street) with the grounds of a big museum with a lovely fountain in front although I'm not sure if the museum is considered part of the Palace (for admission purposes) or if it can be entered from another side.And unlike at the other palaces, the main building of this palace can be entered (not just to look at from right outside) so you can get a close-up view of the throne stage.  Also present here at the entrance gate are two or three ""ceremonial guards"" (didn't see them on the way in at about 10 am though, only saw them on the way out about an hour later), but I'm sure there's no big ceremony involving a lot of guardsmen in colorful attires with some holding beautiful flags as at Gyeongbokgung since there's simply no space here for such a ceremony.Coming by subway, City Hall Station (Lines 1 & 2) is where to get off, and you're pretty much right outside the Palace once you get out of the station onto the big street Sejong Daero (just a 1-to-2-minute walk to the entrance gate).  And, what I suggest for the ticket is getting an ""integrated ticket"" for 10,000 won (the equivalent of 10 US dollars) which is good for like a month and which gives you admission to four of Seoul's five palaces (except for Gyeonghuigung which I'm sure is a small one, maybe even smaller than this one) & Jongmyo Shrine; also do keep in mind that this palace along with Changdeokgung & Changgyeonggung are closed on Mondays whereas the main palace Gyeongbokgung & Jongmyo Shrine are closed on Tuesdays."
47,4.0,"I happened to go on the perfect day. I got there right when the changing of the guard was happening (happens at 11:00am, 2pm, and 3:00pm). And it was free for everyone that day (normal admission is ₩3,000). The National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Deoksugung  is free but you need to make a reservation for the Seokjojeon Hall: Neoclassical Western Style Building. This place is great to see the difference between modern and old but you'll be done in an hour maximum. Go to City Hall Station Exit 2 from Line 1 or Exit 12 from Line 2."
48,5.0,I'm grateful that I visited this place during the spring season and witness the cherry blossom trees. It is also nice to watch the Royal Guard-Changing Ceremony in this palace.
49,5.0,"Staying right next door (The Plaza), I have no excuse not to visit this palace. In fact, it is the first palace I visited in Seoul. I deliberately waited to write this after visiting others. To me, this is the most quaint. It was the last day of autumn & I joined the morning English tour which was very informative. Especially on the Joeson Empire. Then I wandered into this part of the garden which took my breath away: the glorious colours of autumn. I bought the Royal Museum Pass. The MMCA in this palace requires a separate entrance charge."
50,4.0,"OK, I admit it - I was a lucky one.  But first, some background.  Outside the main gate, at certain times you'll have to look up, they have a stand for individuals to dress in traditional outfits and take photos.  This is timed to coincide with the changing of the guard ceremonies, replicating the traditional method of days gone by.  They select a tourist to participate.  Being selected made the visit inside even more magnetic.  It's not huge inside, but it shows some history, including some modern aspects.  If you like history, sign up for the Seokjojeon Hall (in advance on webpage).  It's newer but fancy.  If your time in Seoul is limited, you'd probably want to skip the palace tour."
51,5.0,The palace is located right in the heart of Seoul. It is a nice respite from the busy urban area. Be sure and attend one of the Changing of the Guard ceremonies.
52,5.0,"The living quarters of Korea's first and last but one emperor, who enjoyed coffee. It's a charming place to visit, even if you're not interested in the history. If you love taking photos, it's a wonderful location. The trees are beautiful, and so many interesting details inside and outside the buildings.Honestly, I'm not interested in modern history (20th century), but I suggest you go with someone, who's well-versed in the life of King Gojong. It's a very human story, worth listening to.Occasionally (even on weekdays) there's a ceremony of changing the guards in front of the palace. Catch it if you can."
53,5.0,"Deoksugung palace is smaller than other palaces. But it attracted me more cause I could enjoy it with less people there. I was there when there's a ceremonial (not the guards changing)happened. It took place in front of the palace gate and they even had a parade on the street. No need to buy ticket at that time. I was so lucky I could enter the palace for free. By the time I finished going around, the parade just returned back so I could take more photos.The location is close to city hall."
54,4.0,The Deoksugung Palace is conveniently located next to the City Hall subway station. It is not a big as the other palaces like Changdeokgung or Gyeongbokgung palaces but is unique as it has 2 western styles buildings inside which was the residence of the royal family for a while. There is a tour of this residence which is interesting. The changing of the guards is definitely the highlight of the palace. From there I walked down to Sungnyemun Gate and Namdaemun Market.
55,4.0,I enjoyed the little palace. Nice quick walk around if you are alone or in small groups. They had a performance which you sit down by the steps to enjoy and free coffee workshop which also served free brewed coffee. Weather was cool and it was nice to take pictures ((:
56,5.0,"Unlike the grand Gyeongbokgung, Deoksugung is sometimes an overlooked tourist destination -- as evident by the lesser visitor count -- but it certainly doesn't lack any charm. Admission fee is just KRW 1000 (~1 USD). Inside, marvel at the amazing Korean-  and Western-style buildings. Also, make sure to see (up-close!) the Changing of the Guards ceremony."
57,3.0,"I went here to take photos, nice place very quite and few people came in. I took many of photos from different angles and you can take amazing photos"
58,4.0,"Deoksugung palace is also known as Gyeonhun-gung too. It is a walled compound and was used as residence by Joseon periods royal family. It's dates back to 1400,s. There is a changing of guards ceremony three times a day (11:00, 14:00 & 15:30). Inside is National Museum of Art too. There is a elegant stone-wall road on the back on place. Admission to the palace is for 1000 won. And outside its walls is national museum of contemporary art too . Great place to visit not only because of its history but many other places of interest nearby and also the city hall etc."
59,4.0,"Deoksogung Palace is a good palace near the City Hall Station on Line 1 of the Seoul Subway.  It's not as big as Gyeongbokgung but it's still a nice place to visit.  They also have a changing of the guard ceremony and a great park within the palace grounds.  An added bonus is that there's a Dunkin Donuts right next to the palace, which had a different variety of donuts that I don't see in the United States.  It's also a good place to rest since they have free Wi-fi."
60,4.0,This palace is unique in Seoul as it has some Korean style buildings and some western European style buildings. It is worth visiting to see the two styles together. A Korean art museum is also here and worth a quick look (if you come in the day). This is one of the few sights you can visit after 6 pm so you can plan this as the last sight of the day if you are in the palace area (unless you want to see the small but interesting art museum). Free guided tours are available and there is a popular changing of the guard ceremony several times a day.
61,5.0,"I didn't expect much from this palace, it's small (a third of its original size) and gives an impression of a less-than-korean palace sibce there are modern buildings in itBUTIt has difinitely exceeded my expectation. Firstly, it was considerably less crowded than Gyeongbukgung, even in its peak time which is 11 am when the Changing of the Guard takes place. Secondly, the Changing of the guard is a wonderful experience, you can follow the marching band around and watch the change comfortably and then even pause a few times to let you take photos with the guards.Thirdly, the history of the different buildings that compile the palace is very interesting. One of the buildings is a fusion between traditional korean architecture and imperial architecture and to my opinion it was spectacular. For the meek price of 1000 won, I recommend going. I arrived around 9.20am so I even managed to get a free english tour with a guide before following the marching band.Overall I spent 3 hours exploring (including the guard change and half a guided tour)."
62,4.0,After a long day and on my way to an evening flea market and some dinner I passed this nice little palace. Open until 21.00 hours and we'll lit it was little gem for a very little price.
63,5.0,It is smaller (now) than the other palaces but relatively uncrowded so you can explore easily. Great free English speaking guide and if you go to the main residence you may be able (as a foreigner) to book a time for entry. It is worth it and the free English audio is excellent.Not as grand as the Gyeongbokgung palace but rather restful. If you had time I'd do this first as the explained features are the same and the history of the murder of the Emperor's wife takes on meaning.
64,5.0,"What a deal!  People over the age of 65 gets in free!  Located right in the middle of the city.  Besides access to the spacious grounds, there is a walking tour of the Edwardian style Palace.  Unfortunately it is conducted in Korean but one can rent the audio tour.  It is very comprehensive and takes over 75 minutes, so be warned."
65,5.0,Located in the middle of several touristic spots. This palace gives you the opportunity of scape of the big city and see some beautiful buildings.The entrance is very cheap. Around 1 US dollar. There's the change of guard constantly going on. And it's a great opportunity to have a bit of the spirit of old Korea and take pictures with those characters. There's free wifi inside and it's not allowed to smoke.
66,4.0,"The grounds and the palace are nice. But, the reason to go is to see the changing of the guards. Very interesting and very colorful+very tourist friendly. Many photo opportunites."
67,4.0,"A nice example of the palaces but time your visit to watch the changing of the guard. It is very colorful and adds to the ""ancient"" feel of the palace. One of the buildings house the National Museum of Contemporary Art.  Worth a couple of hours."
68,4.0,"Easy to reach by metro. Buy a combination ticket for all the palaces and jongmyo for 10.000 KRW. Ther is a small empire museum in the basement, the larger palace museum is only open for guided tours.The changing of the guard is a nice show to see. Most of the action takes place outside the Palace ground, in front of the main entrance, so better try to be outside than inside to see the ceremony."
69,4.0,I was there after visiting the Art Museum and I watched the changing of the guards at 11 am.  It was quite an experience with all the marching and drums performance.
70,4.0,It does not get more central than this and the daily changing of the guard ceremony is fund to see as well. The main temple building is lovely but there are a few unique things to see here:The small lake garden section in front of a tea house / gift shop is one lovely aspect. The 19th century pagoda with hints of iron Eiffel era railing is particularly unusual and distinguishes parts of this complex from the other temples and palaces. It is the last hint of the final Korean royal family.
71,5.0,"I got to witness the change of Guards, and a terrific lady from HighSchool , who was volunteering to Guide Tourist around for free, the entrence fees are nothing, don't forget to bring your Hat, and it takes more than one hour, all rebuild after the fire , you need to learn about History there for sure"
72,3.0,"Should come if you are into history and stuff. I'm not one myself so just stepped by for landscape, but it is nice."
73,3.0,"It was a very cold day - 0 degrees so my walk around the grounds was brisk! The entry fee is only 1000 won (about $1.50 AUD) so inexpensive!There are free tours leaving twice a day and there are brochures just inside the gates in English. There are a number of plaques dotted about that have a short paragraph in English explaining the relevance which is very useful. Overall it is a peaceful place that was largely empty in December and is was easy to stroll around and look at the gardens (although they are pretty bare in winter). The grounds also house the Daehan Empire History museum, which has tours of the 1st and second floors of the palace (I peeked through the windows, was worth a look if you like palaces!) and you can reserve your place in the free queue almost every hour - I didnt know this before I went, so the tours were full. Check it out before you go, the rooms looked lovely. In the ground level was a  museum about the history of the dynasty? I'm not really sure, there was an english brochure which didnt explain much and none of  the displays had english translations so I am not sure what it was about. Give it a miss if you are in a hurry, although it is nice to get in outside from the cold. The changing of the guard was at 11am and I was able to see them marching from behind the hall, all the way through the gardens to the outside gate. Ignore the cheapskates who say to not pay, go in and see it! It was a good spectacle. Allow about an hour, and there are plenty of toilets and drinking fountains throughout as well as a few vending machines if you want a quick drink or snack."
74,4.0,A bit smaller than Gyeongbukgung but still beautiful. Perfect for those who want to see the historical era of Korean Kingdom but have limited time. During autumn the palace garden looked very beautiful. The changing of royal guard ceremony is also very interesting to watch.
75,4.0,"it was great ...walking along the stone wall side of deoksugung palace is beautifull , especially when autumn. It is a famous destination for the domestic and foreign tourist."
76,5.0,Doldamgil is very famous for couple's dating course. Autumb foliage was very good. Open at night so you can consider night tour. Place of combination of traditional building modern building. You can imagine how Korea( Joseon dynasty) had tried to change in 19th century.  :)
77,5.0,"Try to catch the changing of the guard ceremony, but also do pay the 1000 Won to enter and take a walk around.  It's a gorgeous place to take some pictures and feels like a sanctuary in the middle of Seoul."
78,4.0,Simply beautiful lots of color great place to take pictures!!!!!! I love my family and we had a wonderful time learning about Korean history•°•
79,5.0,"If your plan includes Namdaemun Market, then it is very likely that you'll walk past this palace.  Therefore, I'll highly recommend you pay a visit to this famous landmark and soak in the ancient context behind Korean royalty many centuries ago. The most unique section in this palace is the attached Western, neo-classical European styled buildings. This is a stark contrast on the conventional and traditional Chinese-styled palace facade."
80,5.0,This palace is a quick walk from my hotel so had to visit en route to Namdaemun market. Beautiful grounds!
81,3.0,"At the time of my visit, the main hall was completely under wraps for renovation.  That said, you may find – as I did – that this compound offers more of a cool, leafy break from frantic, downtown Seoul than a serious competitor to the other of Seoul’s palaces.  It has very much of a park-like layout that seems to encourage relaxing and strolling.  The two main structures at the time I was there were the completely incongruous neo- classical Museum of Modern Art and Royal Museum buildings – two structures which look like they’d be more at home in Washington D.C. than in Seoul.The entrance fee is very modest (I believe 1,000 Won) so it is not a great financial investment to check it out, particularly in the middle of a hot day.  I don’t know if it is worth a special trip, but if you have other sights nearby lined up, then it’s logical to stop in."
82,5.0,This is my favourite palace of Seoul. It's not to crowded and the mixture of western and korean architecture is simply awesomeEntrance fee is very reasonable (1000₩ for adults)
83,3.0,"if I compare Deoksugung to the other palaces, Deoksugung is quiet and peaceful, but the scale and size is small so it's not that dynamic and exciting."
84,5.0,"Unexpected quiet and serene palace beside a main 10 lane road. The serenity was so relaxing. The palace building were impressive. However the best thing was the changing of the guard ceremony at 11am. I did not know about it so was surprised, when nearly run over by the parade. Got a really good view and the ceremony had many parts. Took about 25 minutes and was followed by a martial arts display. There were a lot less tourists here, so much more enjoyable."
85,5.0,The perfect time to visit is during the week in the morning right after the palace has opened. That's the perfect time for pictures without crowds of people. This palace is beautiful and shouldn't be missed. I suggest taking a guided tour and attempting to catch the changing of the guard ceremony.
86,4.0,"Deoksugung is one of the most beautiful palace of Joseon Dynasty. It is really famous for its own beauty. There are a lot of delicious restaurants around Deoksugung. If you wear Korean Traditional clothes, you can get free admission."
87,3.0,"Just around the corner off the Seoul City Hall Plaza lies the royal palace of Deoksugung, or ""the palace of virtuous longevity"".It is more subdued that other palaces in Seoul, yet has an equally long history.In addition, it mixes traditional Korean imperial architecture with the grand scale of European colonial architecture and landscaped gardens.Like many royal Korean palaces, it was built in the 1450s and survived centuries until destroyed during the Japanese occupation and then rebuilt.A pleasant hour can be spent walking around the buildings and gardens."
88,4.0,"This palace has history for modern the Greater Korean Empire. If you do not know its own history, it can be boring as it is only just a residence for royal families.There is a free guided tour for brief history of Korean Empire and life of royal families in Seokjo Jeon, a modern architecture in early."
89,4.0,"With all the palaces I've been to around Seoul, I finally got to see changing of guards. The temple, as I was early, was not too crowded compared to other bigger palaces so I had a chance to roam around freely and take photographs."
90,3.0,"It's cool to be there and take some pictures of the guard change. Other than that, it's just a pleasant walk through the palace complex. Nothing astonishing."
91,4.0,"Easily reached by subway and bus, this palace holds a changing of the guards show that recalls former glories, and offers a quiet place in the heart of Seoul.While the buildings are not on the scale of other palaces, this is more intimate and gives an idea of a home rather than an official palace. It is small, but the buildings offer themselves for study and contemplation. The gardens hum with the cries of cicadas in summer, and eventually, as you wander beneath the trees in which they live, you come to pergolas and benches to rest on.The final stop in your visit must be the art museum - this houses changing exhibitions and so each time you visit you will see something new. Currently the art of Le Quede is being shown, and this painter of Korea under Japanese rule, then divided is worth visiting.The entrance price covers both the palace and the art museum - good value for money."
92,4.0,I was really lucky to be able to see this Royal Guards exchanging here wich took place at 14:30.  The whole ceremony took about 15 minutes.  This really worst watching and inside the palace ground is also really nice.  This is the only palace ground that have both the Korean culture and the Western culture here.
93,4.0,It's just next to the Seoul City Hall. Very easy to find.The entry is free. So if you're around have a look!
94,4.0,"This palace is very small and not very interesting. It consists of the entry gate, a paved courtyard with a throne hall and another building in the traditional style. There is also a tiny European-style garden and 2 large, imposing neo-classical buildings built when Korea became an Empire at the end of the 19th century and opened up to the West. One of these appeared to be an art museum with no identifiable entry from the palace grounds; the other European-style palace building was a mystery museum that was not mentioned in any guidebooks or the official Seoul Visitors Guide. The sign in the front said a reservation was needed to see parts of the building but other parts could be seen without a reservation. Upon entering this mystery building to visit the non-reservation parts, I was ushered outside by the non-English speaking staff before I could close the door behind me - clearly I was not welcome, despite what was on the English signage!!!! The whole complex can probably be seen in 30mins or less. The one redeeming feature of this otherwise boring place is the Changing of the Guard Ceremony. This is the best show to see in Seoul and is very entertaining, with a band, martial arts display, traditional dancing and military procedure. It lasts close to 30 mins and is well-worth seeing. The crowd control barriers are placed quite close to the ceremony, so you get a much better view than at Gyeongbokgung."
95,4.0,"Deoksugung Palace is located at the corner of Seoul's busiest downtown intersection and is famous for its elegant stone-wall road.To see : the changing of the guards is an impressive ceremony involving 50 participants, who dress up as Joseon-era soldiers and bandsmen.To get easily use the metro line 1 or 2 to City Hall Station. The operating hours are 9am to 9pm.The entrance will cost you 1'000 won for adults and 500 won for teenagers (7-18 years old)."
96,5.0,"Deoksugung Palace in the intersection of Seoul's busiest downtown. Close to Citu Hall Station (Seoul Subway Line) Exit 2. Admission ₩1,000. Ceremony changing the Royal Guards. Schedule 11.00, 14.00, 15.30 ( Closed on Mondays) Also available free tour guide in many languages. Provide Tradional Hanbok for free to walk around and take a picture with the guard also free postcards. Awesome must try."
97,3.0,"Not the greatest place, but when I saw it there was something like a play with made it a little more exciting, but you can walk through it in half an hour."
98,5.0,"I went here around 9:30 AM and it was near-empty. People say that you should wait till later to avoid to tour groups but there was probably 5 other people here when I visited. This palace grounds is amazingly preserved and it shows the traditional architecture of the Joseon Dynasty. I highly recommend buying the combination ticket for the other palaces if you are going to visit them as well. It costs 10,000 Won (~$10 USD)."
99,3.0,"It was hard to get excited about this attraction. It is a nice spot to take a short walk around the buildings, and the entrance fee is so cheap. Worth a quick look."
100,3.0,Situated in City Hall station exit1 Area. An admission 1 Adult Fee it costs 1000 KRW ; The palace itself combined with Seoul National Museum building and the old Council parliamant which now transform a place to exhibit for Korean King's Western Resident style; There are many complex elegants room display such as Main Lobby hall; Bedroom; Library-Dining room etc. For Guide information service visitor must do letter for group permission tour.Individual audio various languages provided at registration counter.
101,5.0,"I found this place better, well during Autumn, among others. I guess each grand palaces has its own distinction. Deoksugung Palaces during Autumn flows with warm colors both inside and out. Though the place is not as big as Gyeongbokgung, you can just sit and relax while having coffee or a Korean ice cream,"
102,4.0,"This is a very nice park to sit and walk in, and the added bonus are the palace buildings. This part of Seoul has limited green space left over, and it allows you (even in the winter) to sit in a bit of peace for as little as US$ 1.It has a number of nicer building to look at - one always wonders how much is really old, and how much has been restored. And with respect to the ceremonial guards - check-out all the glued on moustaches and beards ;-)"
103,5.0,Cherry blossoms all around! Seriously one of the most beautiful parks/attractions I've been to. It's like a different world once you step into the gate (it's like in the middle of Seoul and it seems worlds apart with the serenity).Must-see if you visit Seoul. I think I paid something around $15-20 for it but it's worth it.
104,4.0,"Take the subway to City Hall Station (line 1,2), the palace is just beside the station. Nice to visit in the evening where the colors and breeze is wonderful.."
105,5.0,"Right across the large square from City Hall. Beautiful palace, as usual in Korea, very well maintained. A popular place with school children. So you get to see plenty of children, apart from the impressive palace."
106,3.0,"It is the smallest of the 4 royal palaces and also the one which hosted the Joseon kings for the smallest period. It is actually built for the relatives of the king but from time to time the king had to use this palace during Japanese invasions in Korea. It has two western style buildings inside along with the traditional Joseon buildings. Moreover, it had two main gates, one facing south and one facing east but now the gate facing south exists no more. So the remaining gate and the throne hall faces different directions. For adults, admission fee for Deoksugung is 1000 KRW. But if you buy a combined ticket for royal palaces which is valid for 1 month you will pay 10000 KRW and with this ticjket you will be able to visit Changdeokgung, Huwon, Changgyeonggung, Gyeongbokgung, Deoksugung and Jongmyo Shrine. A very good deal if you have a few days in Seoul."
107,4.0,"Chance upon this place while walking along the main road; I didn't know there were several palaces here in Seoul.It's a nice place to visit, to talk around enjoying the architecture and the garden. The entrance fee was relatively low (1,000won)."
108,4.0,"Just strolling around the area sightseeing and poof , out comes a palace out of nowhere! Love how you can randomly find something like this out of nowhere and be in awe! It was also good timing as they were doing the changing of the guard! So relax and enjoy the show! By the way , I was alone and kinda wandered into the exit side of the entrance and ended up inside the palace.So if you're alone (wink wink) , not sure if theres a fee to get in, but feel free to wander and explore that side of the entrance"
109,5.0,"This is the palace that you can (and should) see in the evening, when the lights turn it into a kind of magic.  The best $1 admission ever.  And in a city where so much is rebuilt, this has some original buildings."
110,4.0,"Really relaxing palace to visit, it's smaller and less crowded than Gyeongbokgung. I found the combination of Eastern and Western style buildings to be interesting as well. The throne hall and other buildings are small but very pleasing to the eye. It's also quite easy to reach from the metro and a changing of the guards ceremony is done here, I was lucky to arrive right at the beginning of one. Admission is cheap and I would advise adding a visit to this palace along with Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung."
111,5.0,Great relaxing stroll through Korean history. Time your visit and make sure to see the changing of the guard. It was pretty interesting. You can see most of the grounds in about 30 minutes. There is a free modern art museum at the end of the park. The entire thing cost about $1 to get in.
112,4.0,"In the right middle of Seoul's central business district you can feel the touches of old Korean royal palace.  Even though it is not a full-scale royal palace structure of Chosun dynasty you can feel the touches of royal palace buildings in about 30 minute walk.  Autumn season after lunch time will be the best timing.  This palace is very close to couple of hotels such as The Palace, Lotte, Westin Chosun, Koreana...."
113,4.0,"I lucked in on 'Cultural Wednesday' - free entry on the last Wednesday of each month. Mind you, the tickets are only 1000WON. Large gardens and walkways, buildings from several dynasties, and the modern art museum has been installed in one of the 'modern' palaces buildings. Alas, it was closed for renovations at the time. If you are interested in history and architecture it is worth a visit. It is not as large as some of the other palaces, so an hour or two is probably ample - and be prepared to walk."
114,2.0,"This is the only attraction that had an admission fee,,but there was little see.most of the buildings had been demolished,and those that remained had nothing in them.there was an art gallery which I was in and out of in 5 minutes.poor reward for a long walk on a hot day."
115,3.0,"I went here at night so I missed all the guided tour. Comparing this palace to the other, it is relative small. If you are only going to one palace, I recommended you to go to the others first."
116,3.0,"You will find almost nothing but empty palaces. The pattern is nice, but it's can be seen in other places in Korea. Ticket is cheap, just 1000 KRW, but really that cheap is not worth"
117,3.0,"This is a very small property since much of the original Palace land has been sold off for development. The buildings that still exist are nice and there is an english brochure available for 500 won. Admission is only 1000 won for adults. The whole thing can be seen in under an hour. Inside the walls it is very peaceful, you can bring a lunch and enjoy a nice meal on one of the benches."
118,3.0,"Deoksugung Palace is situated on a much smaller site than the other palaces in Seoul. It is confined in the city, almost surrounded by high rise buildings and roads with heavy traffic. Deoksugung Palace was used a home for the King when other royal palaces were burnt to the ground by the Japanese in the Colonial Period. In the current day, Deoksugung now also happens to be the site of the National Museum of Art, and of course another major place of interest for tourists, but not quite as popular as Gyeongbokgung.Another point of interest at Deoksugung Palace is the great statue of the Korean King ‘Sejong the Great’. This statue provides a nice photo opportunity and it is not always easy to find yourself alone without the mass crowds in front of your lens.I would place Deoksugung in third place of the 3 major palaces in Seoul, behind Gyeongbokgung, and Changdeokgung. If you have time to visit all three, please do! Otherwise, you will need to prioritise."
119,5.0,"Situated in the center of the city, right at the subway exit. Not a very big one, which makes it a good choice when you don't have much time but still want to do some sightseeing. Entrance is only $1 but there's additional charge for entering the museum located inside. Pretty crowded among netizens during lunch time. Make sure to check the schedule of changing guards ceremony outside the main gate."
120,4.0,"It was a truly unique experience to watch the elaborated change of guards ceremony in front of Deoksugung Palace, it was like a walk into history. The ceremony happens three times a day at 11am, 2pm and 3.30pm. Traditional Korean outfits, or better known as habok, could be borrowed for picture-taking with the guards after the ceremony.The palace itself is surrounded by the busy urban traffic, located just above City Hall Subway Station, opposite Seoul Plaza. Within the ancient walls, you will find old Korean palaces and western-style buildings, forming a stark contrast against the modern skyscrapers of Seoul.The charm of the past, the beautifully lined trees and the serenity of the palace ground is enchanting. Just be sure, not to visit on Monday, because it’s closed.If you are visiting during winter, drop by the ice-skating rink opposite the entrance of Deoksugung and have fun doing one of the Korean’s favorite winter sport for as little as 1000KRW."
121,4.0,"Deoksugung is one of the four palaces in Seoul and it may be the easier one to access, right next to City Hall. There is a small entrance fee (KRW 1,000) I think, but it is worth it as you can freely wonder in the park and around buildings, with skyscrapers in the background. There is also a Museum within the complex (at the back) where it is possible to view Korean artwork for the early 20th century (for an extra fee). There is also a café with a souvenir shop on the grounds. There is also a changing of guard ceremony at the entrance three times per day which is worth watching for traditional costumes and music. If you can only see one palace, make it this one!"
122,4.0,"Deoksugung is easy to get to from Line 1 Metro stop city hall, it sits along side the modern western style building. I arrived just as the changing of the guards ceremony was starting, the ceremony happens every day except Monday at 11am,2pm and 3:30pm. After watching the ceremony you can line up and have your photo taken with them, the security guards are more then happy to taken your photos.The grounds are very peaceful and many people go there and just sit and enjoy the scenery. As it is the smallest of all the palaces it is rather plain, however due to buying the combo ticket it was worth going in and checking it."
123,5.0,"This this is very nice to visit,when in Seoul,Korea it will truly gives you a feel during the ancient time in Korea,the changing of guard is the highlight in this palace I must say,when I visited this palace I luckily witnessed it,and it's a photo opportunity for everyone,because it happens right in front of the palace,when you enter in the palace complex there is an entrance of 1000 won,and it's a treat because there's a lot to see in this place,it feels like your part of it's past the great history that happened in this place,there's a lot of bench under the trees,once your hear,you could feel the silence and solitude even though it's located just in front of the Seoul City Hall.when you walk out of the palace go to the tourist information booth on the left part of the palace gate and ask for the nearest tourist spots located along this area,just Few steps king SEJONG MUSEUM is located together with the BLUE PALACE very accessible from here,just explore the place and you'll say it's a treat and worth the walk. Happy exploring!!"
124,4.0,"Deoksugung literally means the Palace of Virtue and Longevity in Korean or Chinese. It is not well known that the Chinese was very much the official language in Korea, although King Sejong created the Korean scripts in the late 15th century. I will mention the modern dimension first. The place is near the City Hall. One building houses the national museum of art, which is not worthy its great name, but holds special exhibitions. I was impressed by a modern Korean painter who adopted Western techniques in his paintings. Also Western style was introduced into the architecture and landscape in the compound. Without knowing the history, one will not find the palace particularly interesting. So let me add a historical flavor. This place was used as royal places twice. First was during the Korean resistance to the Japanese invasion at the end of the 16th century. Since all others palaces were burned, this place served as royal palace for a while. It became a royal palace again after King Gojong ended his yearlong refuge in the Russian embassy in 1907. Gojong ascended the throne at the young age in 1863, and was under the influence or control of his father and later his wife. He declared himself an emperor, but was forced by Japanese to abdicate the throne to his son, the last emperor. His death and Wilson’s 14 Points in January 1919 triggered the March First Movement, which aimed at Korean independence."
125,4.0,Deoksugung is located across from city hall and is a very quiet attraction when not visiting during the changing of the guard.  The cost is only 1000 won and is a nice relaxing area to walk around with a little gallery located on the grounds.Well worth the admission
126,5.0,"Some say once you've visited a palace, you need not see the others. I would rather look at it differently, as I'd like to think each palace has its own tale to tell. This shows a great combination of history and the metropolis within arms reach. They even held a Korean Cantata outside which gave the viewers another taste of Korean culture. Great place to sit, relax and contemplate. Very cheaply priced as well, I think it merely cost me KRW 1,000.00 to get it :)"
127,4.0,"just happened to walk by to take the metro, and realized that it was free on the day. I decided to check it out. It is a nice park with historical buildings around. Although sometimes with many reconstructed / newly painted buildings I feel it loses its authentication a little bit. It is nice to see how the eastern and western building combined as the entertainment room was built with Russian Architect with eastern flare. Surely is interesting. I agreed with others that if you don't have lots of time around Seoul, don't just spend time looking through palaces. Just pick one and enjoy other attractions."
128,4.0,The sprawling palace grounds contains the palace and many other sattelite building set amidst a park like setting. The palace building was getting renovated when I visited so could not get inside (not sure if it is open to public in the first place) but the rest of the buildings are small one storey wood buildings. This dates back to the early eighteenth century and gives one a sense of life & history from back then. It is conveniently located near the Namdaemun city center and costs just 1000 Won (less than US$1) for entry. Thee are guided tours. I had one morning to spare and visited this place and spent about 1.5 hours. Liked it. The only reason I didn't give five stars is that there was no 'wow' factor but it is definitely worth a visit.Hope you found the review useful. Enjoy your trip!
129,5.0,"Deoksugung is important for two reasons, it become a royal palace following the Imjin War and was breifly the primary palace until Changdeokgung was rebuilt in the early 17th century. Second, near the twilight of the Joseon dynasty, Emperor Gojong used the palace as a refuge after the brutal murder of his wife.The palace itself consists of roughly 1/3 of the structures that once stood within the complex. The palace is not as beautiful and well-preserved as Changdeokgung Palace, nor as grand as (the largely rebuilt) Gyeonbokgung Palace. Yet, I really enjoyed my visit for both the history and pleasant atmosphere within the palace grounds. There is one unique feature of Deoksugung,  the European style palace structure that stands out rather prominantly. For those interested in Seoul's dynastic past, the first palace you should visit is Changdeokgung, the second should be Deoksugung."
