0,4.0,"This is about 90~120 min wall walking on Bugaksan Mountain. It's really good walking(or easy hiking) on the mountain. But, with some restrictions, I think Inwangsan Seoul Fortress gives a better satisfaction.- This is the part of Seoul Fortress securing Hanyang(former name of Seoul in Joseon Dynasty). Severely damaged and rebuilt actually.- West End: Changuimun Gate / East End: Sukjeongmun Gate- Since starting/ending points are uneasy to reach by public transportations, there aren't many visitors. I recommend starting from Changuimun Gate (bus #1020 #7022 #7212) and ending to Sukjeongmun Gate. And it's about 15~20 min walk to the bus stop (bus #1111 #2112).- Wall walking is not that exhausting nor risky. But, it has some secured sites nearby. Visitors must present ID cards at the entrances. Visiting time is limited. Taking photos/videos toward them is not permitted. Cameras are watching and they'll come to you soon if you don't follow. On the other hands, Inwangsan Seoul Fortress has almost no restriction. So, I recommend Inwangwan for more comfortable time.- Good viewpoints: Baegakmaru(peak), Cheongwoondae and Gokseong- This is obviously the main course of Bugaksan Mountain. But, Bugaksan also has other nice areas such as Bugak Palgakjeong Pavilion, Bugak Skyway, Kim Shin-Jo Route(hiking route of terrorists' invasion), etc."
1,4.0,"I probably should have done my homework a bit better and read other reviews that recommended climbing Seoul City Wall beginning at the western part of the wall at the Malbawi Information Center.  Instead I started my ascent at the Changuimun Gate.  As others have said, this is a restricted military area and one must show a resident card or passport and sign in.  You will be given a badge to wear for the duration of your climb, and boy what a climb it was.  I cannot say I am in the best shape so this was very strenuous and hard on the knees.  At points I thought it was never going to end but the views were worth it and I met many nice people along the route.  It also was not very crowded.  I started my journey around 1330 and ended up at Samcheong Park around 1600.  Make sure you bring plenty of water.  There are no restrooms or facilities along the way.  Pictures of the city are restricted in many areas, with the 121 bullet tree a stark reminder of why this is a military zone.  I will say the tree was further away from the Blue House than I thought it would be.  I took a picture of it as I doubt I will be adventurous enough to try this walk again...even if I began from the other direction!!!  I probably should have exited from Waryong Park but was told it would be easier to catch a cab by Samcheong Park--that was a good 1/2 trek from the Malbawi Info Center, but luckily it was largely downhill.  In the end I found a bus as I exited the park that dropped me off in front of the Sajong Performing Arts Center and picked up the metro from there.  Altogether I am glad I did this but boy were my legs aching the next day."
2,5.0,"Here's an idea for a morning commune with nature with some sightseeing of the ancient city wall and vistas to boot.  Take a taxi to the entrance of Samcheong Park off of Bukchon-ro.  Walk about half an hour uphill following the signs to Malbawi Lookout.  At the information desk you will be asked to complete a little form and show your passport and you will be given a visitor tag attached to a lanyard to wear.  Pick up an English language map if you wish.  Now get ready for an hour of good fun with stairclimbing (at the fastest pace with only one quick camera stop) going up to reach Mt. Bukason and then down to Changuimun Gate where you will return the tag, walk down a flight of stairs and take a taxi home.  Of course, this is not only one way to do the hike of the northern wall and you can feel free to hike part or the full way and return to your starting point.  The strategic importance of the commanding heights cause the ROK army to be on trail maintenance duty so the developed trail is about as pristine as I have ever seen.  The July Pine Tree with bullet holes (North Korean assassin squad had it taken to them in spades!) is curious.  DO NOT FORGET YOUR PASSPORT AND WATER BOTTLE!"
3,5.0,"I took the Waryong Park to Changuimun course, and the amount of stairs are no joke. I consider myself fairly fit but I was huffing away at some sections of stairs. The course was not very clearly marked and I had to ask the guards stationed all around to make sure I was going the right way. The scenery made up for it, you could see right across Bugaksan Mountain on a clear day. Remember to bring your passport as registration is a must, and bring plenty of water and some snacks or energy bar. I will hike this trail again when I go to Seoul next time."
4,4.0,"Thanks to the other reviewers' recommendation, I took the hiking course from Waryong Park to Changuimun. The steps in Changuimun are probably in hundreds or thousands...so please do not start from this gate. The view was excellent but unfortunately on the day of my hike there was fog and I could not see gyeongbukgung well. The hike takes around 2hrs with rest and photo shoots. I like that it's easily accessible and quite easily done, ...if you start from Waryong Park."
