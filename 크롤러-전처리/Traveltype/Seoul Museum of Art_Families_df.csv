2,4.0,"Easily accessible from City Hall subway station the Seoul Museum of Art (SeMA) is a good place to while away a couple of hours and is not an overly expansive Museum so three floors of exhibits and collections should take no more than a morning or afternoon. We caught the Tim Burton exhibition which was predictably busy but very fun and as expected a very quirky,macabre and imaginative outpouring of Burtons creativity over several decades. At the end of the exhibit there were several examples/props of more recent films - the Scissorhands of the eponymously titled film,Catwomans suit from Batman and a number of models from his animations. It was his only exhibition in Asia so perhaps says something for the pulling power of Seoul's art culture and this particular art museum. We paid W12000 as adults and W5000 for our 4 yr old. Cafe onsite for coffee,sandwiches and snacks."
