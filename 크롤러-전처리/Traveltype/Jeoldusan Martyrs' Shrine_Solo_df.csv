She then took me to crypt where people were honoring martyrs and then swept me to museum where i was greeted by a a wonderful knowledgeable guide. Wonderful serene grounds , plenty of gardens for quiet reflection. I then walked down river to mapo area full of nice restaurants. Will return."
1,1.0,"This used to be one of my favourite places to go back to or just take a walk at and I thought it was really nice that they wanted to honor the memory of the Catholic missionaries. That changed today when I discovered an 'anti-foreign' monument stating that Westerners are barbarians and (local) people should do everything to avoid them and their culture. I mean, it's ironic since Christianity has been already introduced to Korea for a few hundreds of years now and it's widely spread. Isn't Christianity a part of Western culture in a sense? The order mentioned on the monument might be really old but the monument itself and the park around is not, so people deliberately put it there and didn't find anything wrong with it. I think everyone should know this before they decide to visit this place."

I have to say that Koreans take the faith very seriously and I was surprised to see even young people there. There were quite a lot of people on a Monday afternoon. Even if you aren't Catholic,  its a nice place to stroll,  walk around,  and look out to the Han river.  The grounds are immaculate and you feel worlds away from the hustle and bustle of Seoul.  Once you're done,  the Mecenatpolis Mall is a short walk away and you can do a little shopping to boot."
3,3.0,"Jeoldusan Martyrs' Shrine is important as a shrine and small museum about Catholism in Korea. Unlike most countries in East Asia, Korea has a sizable Christian population (20-25%). Korea's early confrontations with the Catholic faith was anything but peaceful, many of the faithful died in brutal acts of violence for their beliefs.The grounds of the shrine are well-kept and good for a short walk. Plenty of statues and signage with historical texts line the pathways. The shrine is located near the Han river, and relatively easy to visit. I enjoyed my time here, but if you are not Catholic the site lacks some of its meaning."
