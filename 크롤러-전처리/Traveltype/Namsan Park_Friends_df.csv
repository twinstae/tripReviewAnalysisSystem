0,5.0,"If your cannot trek , take cable car . You get to see beautiful sunset in the evening . After completing it , too if the mountain is the N Seoul Tower And  love locks ."
1,5.0,Good place to relax and enjoy the nature. I did some jogging and trail run in the park. Seoul city can be viewed 360 degree from here.
2,4.0,"Namsan park has got the ropeway that will lead you to the N Seoul Tower. While on the Ropeway, you can see a bird eye view of Seoul. The both way ropeway journey cost around 9000 KRW."
3,4.0,"We went up by cable car and enjoyed the view on the city from the park. We didn't go up the tower, as it was hazy (as always)."
4,5.0,"Lovely place, goods vibes, friendly people, i will come back in the next time, high recommended!!! Love it so much"
5,5.0,"Getting to the cable car was a fun experience. We could either choose to climb up these extremely steep steps or get on a small elevator run by a gentlemen. Of course we chose the elevator and rode up shoulder by shoulder up to the cable cars. Even so, it was such a fun experience. There is a convenience store where you can purchase food, drinks, and locks before getting on the cable car, and at the top are plenty more shops, convenience stores and experiences."
6,4.0,Negatives: the queue to get into the cable car. And they cram too many people into the cable car.  We went to Namsan Park on a Sunday and were lucky to get a sword demonstration/ and other acts. It was a clear day and the views were good.
7,4.0,Actually in my trip I wanted to watch fall colors..to reach and go to Namsan park from Seoul station is very easy.. two km from station..in the center of city Namsan park really give forest sensation.. when we were walking the sensation of the fall colors it was so exiting..
8,5.0,"If you like to stretch your legs once in a while, you can walk up Namsan and enjoy the park while getting a little exercise in."
9,3.0,"We went at night and the view was amazing. You get a 360 degree view of Seoul. A bit touristy as you can imagine, and steps. Even though the cable car says it is wheelchair accessible, once you get to the top there is nothing but stairs. Having climbed the stairs, and there were still many, I saw that you can catch a bus to the top. However there are still stairs and the wheelchair accessibility is still tricky. They are very friendly and accommodating though so while tricky is possible. Also I was not in a wheelchair, just have arthritic knees."
10,5.0,if your planning to tour at korea dont missed to visit one of the romantic place which is namsam tower
11,5.0,Stunning views of the city. Cable ride up cost 7000 wan each one way....might have considered walking up if we hadn't done so much walking all day. Guidebook warned about it being confusing to walk dow...we had no problems and did it at night...paths are well lit. I cannot imagine a visit to Seoul and not coming here!
12,5.0,"The cable car is definitely worth the money, if you don't want to walk to the mountain. Good for a hot day, since it's a bit windier on the top. Would not recommend visiting with a wheelchair or strollers.The park is really clean and pretty quiet. A place to relax."
13,4.0,"Weather permitting, you can get a nice view of the city from the top of the N-Seoul Tower. Pretty easy to get to with buses from Myeong-dong (just a 15-minute ride)."
14,4.0,One of the pretty faces of Korea can be seen in parks especially during autumn season. Put it in your bucket list.
15,4.0,"You can either hike all the way up or take the free bus service from Myeongdong to the cable car. From the cable car, you need to walk a bit to see the N-Tower. It is nice to watch the sunset from the tower"
16,5.0,"The best place with an amazing view to the city, also recommend for a couple, the atmosphere is very nice and u can feel the fresh and healing air."
17,5.0,One of the best highlight of our trip is deciding to walk up the Namsan hill. Actually we were forced to do so due to reaching way early to the cable car operating hours 😆😂So we choose the trail right opposite of cable car station. Expect many stairs to climb up. But you won’t be disappointed during Autumn due to weather & fall Color. Not only the view on top is beautiful but also the nature along the way. City skyline & fall colour on freshly sunlit trees are brilliantly dazzling.
18,4.0,"This cable car takes you to the top of  XX Mountain where there is a very good view over Seoul.Of interest is the thousands of love locks that have been attached to the railings around the grounds at the top of the site. almost all carry messages of love.A beer and potato croquets are well worth trying in the restaurant.At about KRW9,500 the return trip is worth the effort."
19,5.0,"Wow! A park that you can see the Seoul itself. Been here few times, but it gives me again and again the impression that Seoul is a beautiful place."
20,4.0,"Love the place and you can see seoul city from the top. But you've to wait patiently if you want to ride the cable car. It took us 1,5 hours to ride the 5 mins cable car. There's also some kind of performance in the park. Don't know the exact time. But be sure to watch it if you see them"
21,4.0,There was long line when we were at the Namsan tower but its all worth-it. The fall foliage scenery during the cable ride and the city lights at night were eye catching...
22,4.0,"We took the cable car up and then walked down which was an easy downhill walk. The leaves were absolutely stunning! Was interesting to see the tower, although we didn't go up as the view from the top of the park was sufficient for us. After strolling through the walkways covered in locks, we came across a cultural performance which we watched for around half an hour with very impressive drumming and sword-play."
23,4.0,"Nice and peaceful park. must try the cable car to oversee the views. beautiful trees and you could buy the 'love lock' as wellworth a visit, esp autumn with the maple leaves"
24,5.0,"must do when you are in Seoul. Seoul tower, the plaza, the park. just wonderfull. i go there again for sure"
25,5.0,I took the cable car up to Seoul Tower with some friends. I highly recommend the cable car mainly because of the views.
26,3.0,"Great View of the city, and worth the ride up the cable car. But the tower is not an observatory. The tower is just a restaurant that is really not so hot. But still nice views. I recommend going early evening."
27,5.0,"I am enjoying my time here. I'm not into the observatory area. I'm only at the padlock area. You can take a good pictures here and take a rest. Cable car for return 9000 won.unless you're very fit, you can hike up ** warning the stairs are so many"
28,5.0,"Walked through exciting Myeongdong and took a glass elevator up to purchase tickets for the cable car to the top. Once on top, my friend and I bought some beer and enjoyed the cool evening air and gorgeous city lights. A really fun place for people of all ages."
29,5.0,"Lines for the gondola were outrageous, and the walk is intense but manageable.  I would certainly walk if you are capable.  Be sure to get to the top of the TV Tower for a stellar pano view of Seoul!!"
30,4.0,I've been here twice so far. Once by foot following the trail to get to the N Seoul Tower and the second time to try out the cable car ride. Both visits were leisurely and nice. But be sure to wear sneakers if you're going to walk instead of taking the cable car. It is do-able but comfy shoes would be wise.
31,5.0,"It will be good to see the N Seoul Tower, near Myeongdong Cathedral. I suggest that you get a two way cable car ticket. The place is romantic. You may use the elevator going down. If you ll go to Myeongdong, walk to the bus stop and its just one ride."
32,4.0,Local government needs to continue to preserve the nature as much as possible at this hill. Is a great place for recharge in such a stressful city like Seoul. Also need to have more English signboards.
33,5.0,2nd time to this site lots to do and not very costly so if you are on a budget it wont break the bank. The elevator is super fast and the view from the tower is spectacular try to go on a day were the pollution is low for a better view. Plenty to eat in the area you can walk or take cable car.
34,4.0,We walked through the park on the way to the N Seoul Tower. The paths were nice and clean and it was a nice walk through the trees. It was quite steep. We started from the Public Library entrance and it took about 30 minutes to climb up. There were quite a few rest spots and paths that seemed to lead to other areas of the park. Really nice walk up although it was a tad tiring.
35,5.0,"If you've come all the way to see Namsan tower, you may as well take some time to see Namsan park as well. It's peaceful and beautiful. Well worth taking some time out to see."
36,5.0,"This is an amazing park, especially during the cherry blossom, totally worth the steep climb. However, notice the signs in the park that say ""N Seoul Tower"" actually point to the base cable station. If you plan on walking up to the tower, you might need to walk in the opposite direction (depending where you are)."
37,5.0,"This park is jam-packed with so many things to do and to see! From a cable car to a potential dinner out, this park has it all. And importantly transport - a bus from the centre goes straight UP the mountain! No need to walk or trek it! Sunset is beautiful and I would however recommend that you only do one leg of the 2 parts to the cable car and towards the end of your day out here as it’ll drop you off back in the centre!"
38,4.0,"Available with cable car to go. Nice place, nice to go in afternoon day, one of things to go in seoul"
39,3.0,"Average place for visiting. In my opinion, there are many other places to visit in Seoul. This park can be given as last priority if time is limited."
40,4.0,this is the place to go if you want to enjoy the view of Seoul. If you have the time and want to get your cardio in for the day then you can hike up to the tower. It well paved but does have a steep incline at time. If you haven't walked up then I would recommend it but the second time I took the lift. You save a lot of time and enjoy the view on the ride up. Many spots along the way to stop and take photos.
41,4.0,Love to be at Namsam Park. The cable car is good transportation to go up to Namsan Park. The love padlock make the place unique. Everyone should visit Namsam Park.
42,5.0,"Better buckle up to the top . The view is breathtaking however can be really cold at the top during the winter . The ride on the cable car takes about 3 mins , but the lines can get to you if your not a very patient person visiting on a holiday but once at the top you’ll enjoy the view along with visiting the restaurants , souvenir store and the many other activities going on."
43,5.0,"This is not just a green space to go walking in. There are cultural buildings, a restaurant, a memorial to the lost women, a museum, gardens, monuments to martyrs and the Seoul Tower. This park is definitely worth a full day. You get in a lot of walking, but there is so much to see and do there. Pack snacks for the day since the food offered is more expensive and not as prevalent as other locations, but it is definitely worth your time. You can end your day riding the cable car and going to the Seoul Tower."
44,3.0,We took subway line 4 to Myeongdong station and walked to the cable car station. Bought round ticket for cable car and went up to the Namsan park. Korean traditional marshal art performance and photo sessions for tourists with performers. Great view of Seoul.
45,5.0,"Beautiful Saturday morning at Namsan Park. -7 degrees but perfect sunny day! About 7.5 kilometer one round.  Small cafe on the way, you can grab a cup of hot drink if you are thirsty or feeling cold."
46,4.0,I would go everyday if I live here!  I highly recommend to take a hike up and enjoy the view while taking a quick rest
47,4.0,"A 10minutes walk from Myeongdong metro station to the Orumi Elevator brought us to the cablecar to Namsan Park and the iconic Seoul tower. The queues for the cablecar was long but very well managed by the staff in charge.It was peak autumn, so the autumn foliage was amazing. We spent about an hour or so to enjoy the panaromic views above. It was an enyoyable evening with nice views, but personally, this would not be the most important Seoul attraction to visit if you have limited time in the city."
48,5.0,"We go there before sunset by riding the cable car to the top of the peak. During the ride, we can see magnificent yellow and red leaves over the whole mountain. Shortly after our arrival to the peak, we can see the beautiful sunset. Nice place and a must visit place in Seoul"
49,5.0,Great place to visit. An iconic place in Seoul that one cannot miss while visiting Seoul. many things to see and experience.
50,4.0,Namsam Park gets you to N Seoul Tower which is a must if you're in the area. Not too far from Myeondong is the cable car that will take you up to the top and allow you access to roam about and see the tower and get some great shots. The cable car will take you up and down for a small fee if you don't mind waiting in line. You can get some great shots of the city as well.
51,5.0,"The wait to ride the tram is the only downside.  We waited just over an hour in line.  The ride was worth it.  The views are spectacular at the top. Not as good as at the top of the tower, but still impressive.  Worth the wait."
52,5.0,"This is the mountain park locating in the center of Seoul. Lots of visitors just come and go via a cable car or a bus. They just stay near N Seoul Tower and leave. But, there are definitely many other ways to enjoy Namsan Park.- Observatories(남산전망대)There are a few observatories other than the peak. Mostly locating along paved trail way. Observatory 'Namsan Tower Middle Point(남산타워중간전망대)' is the closest from the peak and nice to watch N Seoul Tower from the distance.- Baekbeom Park(백범공원)The quiet park near Namdaemun Gate. There aren't many visitors in a wide area. The city wall of Joseon Dynasty is still remaining and good to walk and take beautiful photos.- Namsan Open Air Botanical Garden(남산야외식물원)This is a very well-maintained botanical garden. Starts from Hyatt Hotel, Hannam-Dong close from Itaewon.- Trails(남산산책로)There are paved and unpaved trail ways. They both are nice and easy. 2~3 hours is enough. Not at the level of average mountain climbing. Paved trail way starts from near Baekbeom Park and Namsan Library. The starting points of unpaved are many.There are flowers, small animals, birds and some attractions(archery, gym, etc.)- Lots of first comers fail to reach the bust stop to go up the top. Since driveways on the mountain exists only one and one way road, buses go up from Gukrim Geukjang (National Theater - northeast) and go down to Namsan Library(southwest). If a visitor got the wrong way, he/she has to head for Gukrim Geukjang or preceding stops by bus or taxi. Or cable car entrance. But, if he/she is near Namsan Library already, taking a walk is recommended. It's quicker and cheaper. This is the mountain of only 270m high and the trail way is well-paved."
53,5.0,It is very crowded on the weekend but during weekdays not much. There are a couple of trails. With stairs it is harder but faster. Cable car costs 8000 won for round way and 6500 won for one way.
54,4.0,Saw this on the way to the tower. Great views of the city. You can either walk up or take a bus into the forest.
55,5.0,"This is a good place to have an over view of beautiful seoul, the place is very crowded and long queue for the cable car. There is lock love below the N tower. Definitely a place that you must visit, because it represent seoul somehow. I made a video on my trip to Seoul, come and watch for more details on the N tower.Search by title :#4 TRAVEL BLOG DAY 3 JEJU - - - SEOUL"
56,5.0,There are 2 ways to visit Namsan park. One way is to walk up the winding paths taking in the sights gradually and spotting for the other size headgear and colourful walking attire. The other is to go up by cable car. I have done both.The park is well looked after and used daily by the Seoul dwellers for exercise and recreation. Nature is ever present and the views are amazing.Getting to the top is also very much worth it with a wide vista view of Seoul and its surroundings. You can also visit N Seoul tower and take the lift to the top!Definitely a must see place!
57,4.0,"If you're itching for a walk up and down lots of stairs and a nice view over Seoul, go for it. There is also some statues and an outdoor gym"
58,5.0,Good place for hike... for 30 minutes.. Well paved and very enjoyable walking to Namsan Park...nice scenic areas to see the view of Seoul.
59,5.0,"This park is very beautiful, we decided to walk all the way to the top and it was beautiful, there's lots of steps but is absolutely worth it. When you get to the top you can see the North tower and you can buy a ticket to go to the top, it's not expensive and you can see the whole city from up there."
60,5.0,"Had a great time here with my cousin who was visiting me for the week,  we enjoyed going up the tower and taking in the views of Seoul and also the giant teddy bear! LOL kids at heart.  There was also a padlock area for couples, super cute idea. Great place for everyone really and a decent workout too if you want to run up the hill!"
61,4.0,"Great for walking, trekking (depending of your speed) Well maintained, you can do the stairs or go in the paved road around it, little streams will greet you here and there, as well as pretty flowers growing almost as if unkept but not really, just adding a nice touch to the park. You can climb to the top and get down via the via the cable car for 6usd (May17). the North Seoul Towers is visible from here too. The surroundings of the park are lit at night with colorful lanterns. We were on a short trip and it was just want we wanted, a nice and slightly challenging walk to the top amid lovely views of nature, friends,families, girls with their pets, and couples, all gathered here on  warm Sunday afternoon."
62,5.0,A very enjoyable walk around the park!  A sunny day a cool breeze and lots of families out enjoying the outdoors!  Highly recommend this park during the spring months if you visit Seoul!
63,4.0,"Went there at night time, and it was beautiful. Too bad I did not get a chance to come back in the afternoon. went up by bus from Myeongdong and I saw many people walking down. Got a pic of Seoul from above and it was also beautiful :D"
64,5.0,"Got to visit this place twice (in 2012 and 2016). The best place to witness cherry blossom (during Spring season of course), love locks, N Tower, food and whatnot!"
65,5.0,"The air is so fresh to relax with friends or your lover. You can go on top of Namsan park with Cable service ( 8000won/ return ticket) or climb by yr feet. You should also take photo with The Love Clock bridge - many many couples come here to clock their promise together. Then eat something at Namsan tower shop and enjoy great view hight over Seoul city. Dont forget your warm jacket, too!"
66,4.0,"There is a lot of walk in Korea. If you are not tired, you can do this walk. Long walk up but worth the view. You can do a cable car to Seoul tower if you are tired to walk. Two way trip cost 8,500 won and 6,000 for single."
67,5.0,"It is a great park with lovely view. Countless amount of love locks. I really enjoyed my time there, and would recommend it to anyone."
68,5.0,Good place. Lift was amazing with animation on ceiling. View is so nice. You scan see Seoul. Souvenir collection is rich. Many good places to take photo
69,5.0,The trip going there is quite the adventure itself. We came around sunset and we have witness a galaxy unfold before our very eyes.The locks also is quite romantic coupled with several good attraction aside from the spectacular aerial view of Seoul.
70,5.0,Enjoy your day there because I am sure you will love the scenery from up there. Enjoy while you can especially with the family members
71,5.0,"In lieu of taking the cramp cable cars up the hill, we opted to hike the way up! At the top, there was a Korean Lighting Ceremony taking place, where you can rent complimentary traditional Korean dress ware and take photos. I was very lucky to be asked to participate in the opening ceremony- so much fun! Additionally, there are monuments adjacent to N Seoul Tower where you can bring a lock and attach it, much like the Key Bridge in France."
72,4.0,"You can reach Namsan tower and park by bus or cablecar, and also you can walk there.The night view of seoul is really great and it makes me very romantic.After having dinner in myoungdong, go to namsan for taking a walk."
73,4.0,The Namsan tower can be reach by climbing the stairs or either by cable car. In daytime it offers the clear view of the city and in nighttime the scenery change dramatically when the lights are up it seems like ocean of lights very mesmerizing. A must visit place then there were lots of koreanovela that was filmed in there.
74,3.0,"As I have mentioned in my Namsan Tower review, going to this place involves a bit of a hike. But visitors can opt to go via bus, taxi or cable car. On a clear day, one can enjoy city skyline views from this place. Also, do check out the pavilion and old city walls in the area."
75,5.0,"There is the Seoul Tower at the top. The park is free and you can hike through it uphill. At the top, the tower area, there is a booth where you can wear traditional Korean dresses for free. There is a small royal family drama enacted."
76,3.0,"Likewise with N Seoul Tower, avoid going during weekends or at night as that is when it is most crowded. If you have time, take a nice hike up instead of riding the cable car."
77,5.0,"Even though it is a long queue to wait, it is worth to go to the top to look at the whole seoul. We went at night time, it was very beautiful and chilly. However we didn't go to the tower itself, we just stopped at the park where the cable car stopped us."
78,4.0,"I love namsan park, so resfreshing. You can climb and walking around. Great view and fresh air, you must trying"
79,5.0,"This cable car takes you right up to the N tower. Sadly they don't offer a combination ticket, so you need to buy two if you want to go up the tower as well. The ride to the top only takes a few minutes, but is very scenic."
80,5.0,"We walked from Myeongdong Exit 3 all the way to the base of the cable car area. The journey was quiet a long walk with steep slopes. Rode the cable car up for the experience. The view at the top was beautiful. A lot of lovers' locks. There was a performance by a local band called Guitarcarry in the evening. It was relaxing and entertaining watching their performances while eating churros ice-cream bought from a store there. The ice-cream taste bland but the churros was soft, crispy and chewy at the same time."
81,4.0,"Namsan is very iconic of Seoul. Should visit this tower to see the millions of lover's locks. The view is nicer at night with the billions of strings of light known as Seoul.Public transportation will get you there. But if you take the train, you'll have to transfer to a bus to get you closer to the top. I can't remember the exact train station but you can ask anyone and they can tell you. Lots of pale go here at night so it's perfectly safe to go at night. Koreans like to hike, so you'll see people out and about, up and down the mountain. Even if you take the bus up, you will have to still walk up a decently steep walk to get to the tower. Wear comfy shoes. Pay attention to lightening patterns along the walk up if you go at night. The park projects cute images into the walkway up."
82,4.0,Take the cable car up to seoul tower. then stroll around the area and this park. nice place to get a short break from the asphalt jungle.
83,5.0,"this place NO 1 ,to the visitor in Seoul ,so if any one visited Seoul and missed this place ,so he like never visit Seoul , you can took a cable car to the park or ,by tourist bus without cable car ,but I recommend by cable car its breath taking experience ,the park provide you a panoramic view to the city and you can go up to the tower from the park"

86,4.0,"The fee is quite pricey for the Tower lookout point but for the sake of experience, it's encouraged to visit Namsam park. Good walking around the park experience."
87,4.0,"The place is crowded and you can buy locks here. The lights of the tower will be lighted after about 7.30pm. We came up to the tower by cab and cable car. When going down, the cab driver at cable car station trying to quote us 20,000 won a trip. Too expensive! You can take a free shuttle bus at the outside of cable car station for free. They will drop us as nearest mrt station."
88,4.0,"You can take the cable car to the top of the park and see amazing views over the city to all directions. There was a long line to the cable car and it was packed once we got in. If you are lucky, you will fit next to the window and can get some pics. The ride is short but still a good way to go up."
89,4.0,"Definitely take the cable car up, it's worth it and gives good views over the city.  The top of the tower is pretty cool too, with like much of Seoul there is lots of stairs and steep hills at the top."
90,4.0,"Namsan Park, a beautiful park with a tower sitting atop a hill is worth the trip. There are a few ways to go to the tower. Cable car, bus or hiking up. I've went on 2 occasions and took the cable car and bus respectively. Took a straight bus from a bus stop opposite Hamilton Hotel in Itaewon to reach the top. What awaits on top is a beautiful view of Seoul that you wouldn't want to miss. You may also want to opt for the cable car ride as the view is pretty awesome too."
91,4.0,They're are numerouspaths in the park that include paths to the top where the soul tower is at.They're is also a tram lift up/down if you like to do only on direction up/down.   On weekends there are usually some kind of special event at the tower. The tower had views and other activities as well as restaurants at the base or up top. Public transportation to top is also an option (bus).
92,5.0,"Had a wonderful afternoon here hiking and the view of Seoul is marvelous. There is an abandoned temple along the trail. You won't find better place to photograph the skyline of Seoul. If you are able use the stairway up it is a great hike, and free."
93,4.0,"Namsan Tower or Seoul Tower, is a communication and observation tower located on Namsan Mountain in central Seoul, South Korea. At 236m, it marks the highest point in Seoul.

96,5.0,"Situated in the middle of the city, this park provides a pleasant shade and walking paths for the locals doing hiking and for travelers seaking for beautiful views. There is also a traditional village as a part of experience. A tower on top is s place to drink coffee or get some snacks."
97,5.0,Easy access across a pedestrian bridge from the Grand Hyatt is this beautiful park.  There are great trails to hike with many hills if you chose.  You can hike or take a tram up to the Seoul Tower.  The $10 tower tour was not worth the price.  No additional views were noted.  The base of the tower provides great city views.  The park itself was in bloom with spring foliage and there are nice jogging trails if you are interested.
98,5.0,dont take the cable car if you love and appriiete about the nature bcs this is so amazing eps cherry blossoms. wow so excited about that.
99,5.0,The walk through the neighborhood was (literally) breathe taking. We then took the cable cart up to the top. It was well worth it. Beautiful view of the city.
100,3.0,"Great view, went at night and it was amazing. Do not waste your money on the cable car. It's jam packed with people and it's fast - so you cant enjoy the scenery while still being squished by people everywhere."
101,5.0,"This place offers great view towards the city. I was there during day time, cannot imagine how beautiful it is at night. Totally recommended!"
102,5.0,"I already did a review in regards to the N Seoul Tower which is at the top of the mountain in Namsan Park, and particularly noted that the cable car is a great experience and worth the trip. The park is very hilly but the walkways are nicely done so you can rest along the way. Being spring it was especially charming with the azaleas, forsythias, and cherry trees in bloom."
103,5.0,"Highly recommended to come visit. From here you can also take the cable car up to N Seoul Tower.Beautiful place for photoshooting, with many statues of respected diplomats. The place will have senior citizens taking walks there, very peaceful place."
104,4.0,"Maple and gingko trees coloured the whole mountain in warm yellow, orange and red. Namsan offers a very good panoramic view of Seoul. Take your time to stroll down Namsan for a better experience!"
105,4.0,"Thanks to the scourge of jet-lag, we visited Namsan Park at a very early hour (i.e., shortly after dawn) on our first day in Seoul.  To get here, we ascended a few very steep hills.  The nice park at the top and the views of Seoul below proved that our efforts were worth it.  We had intended to go all the way to Namsan Tower, but it appears that the cable car station is under construction (it was closed off with plywood walls and the earth was torn up), and due to the very early hour, we were unable to find anyone in the area to inquire if we could catch the cable car at a different location.  Even if you can't go all the way to the top, however, it's worth a visit."
106,5.0,Namsan park is must see while in Seoul. Its an amazing view of the entire city and the ride up its also very nice.
107,4.0,비싼 가격에 비해 그닥 질이 높진 않음... 밥은 다른데서 먹고 야경 보러 가는게 좋을 듯..has a wonderful view especially at night. beautiful... i dont recommend restaurants up there. expensive and not fine. they got OK food but charge like a Fine restaurant.Eat somewhere else and come here to enjoy the view having some drink or dessert.
108,5.0,We took tons of photos here haha. You may choose to walk up to the Namsan Tower or take the cable car. Just relax and enjoy the view. 💕
109,5.0,One can take a cable ride up to Namsan or hike up. The view from Namsan is excellent and best done at night. There are several restaurants here.
110,4.0,"There are many paths to the top of the mountain (actually like a hill) and city park.  At the top is the N Seoul Tower and views.  Most people take either cable car or bus/car up to near the Tower, but for the active people, the best reason to be here is a good hike without leaving the city.It is also part of the old Seoul City Wall loop, the southern part.  If you walk along the wall, eventually you would go East/West cross the park.  There's a place to get stamped and start your quest for the entire loop.The park has many rest areas.  There are many facilities.  There's even an old weight lifting area near the top, with weights outdoors."
111,4.0,"This is a park on top of a hill in central Seoul. Take the trail up from the west side and enjoy the magnificent view of the entire south, west and north part of the city, all from a platform near the top. Recommend go in the evening. Then either take the cable car down or talk the trail and road down to city center."
112,3.0,On our way to the high tower we decided to take the cable car. Parking near the cable car is almost impossible. They que to get on the cable car was perhaps 15 minutes. The ride up the mountain is very nice. The ride up takes 10 minutes. From the cable car it's a short walk to the tower which offers some amazing views of Seoul
113,5.0,"Beautiful on autumn. Perfect for couples. Easy to get there, easy access, good food and perfect view of the city. Recommend on autumn when the leaves are changing."
114,5.0,"Try to use gondola, it's only 3000 won. Will be nice view.. don't walk because it's too tired hahahaha..Namsan Tower is an icon of Seoul.. It's nice to see BBF filming location.. Better way if you see it in night because Seoul night view is soo good.. ^^"
115,4.0,"wish i tried hiking as the view up there were superb. even it's cold, i still want to wander around not thing king of the weather"
116,4.0,"We didn't go up to the observatory deck, but hey! the view of Seoul from the park is really beautiful! We get to see both north and south part of seoul from up here, along with famous mountains. And yes, the love lock too. There's so many spot to take good pictures. Very near to Namdaemun shopping street."
117,4.0,"Namsan Mountain hosts the wooded Namsan Park, a very nice area of Seoul, great for walking. We walked up the Namsan Mt admiring the plant life, especially the trees, rested by the Pagoda, went up the N Seoul Tower and enjoyed the views. There are some remnants of the historical defensive structures near the top of the mountain. There is also a special marker pointing to the middle of the city of Seoul. Namsan is a worthwhile destination in Seoul."
118,4.0,Best views of the city! You really can take in the massivness of Seoul from here. Go early in the morning though. It was obscenely crowded in the afternoon.
119,5.0,"Especially visible and recognizable when lit up at night.The tower is built on Namsan mountain so you can choose between walking all the way up, queuing for a cable car or do what we did -near the Hanok Village we got a local 02 green bus which uses a circular route. Then you will still have a short climb to the tower itself.At the top, there are crowds and several shops- including an official souvenir shop. It's worth going all the way there despite the commercial side. The view is simply phenomenal, especially at dusk or night-time, and if you go up the tower itself (in a lift!), it's stupendous!Inside the tower, you'll find small tiles where couples have written messages and put photographs, and outside there are lovers' padlocks on the railings."
120,4.0,It's a must come place in Seoul!! The view is beautiful on the way to top the seoul tower! We feel exhausted after climbing up all the stairs but it's totally worth it when you see the view!! You can see the whole city view!!
121,5.0,Took the long trip out and it was totally worth it! Plenty of things to do and it was a relaxing day just walking around and chatting with friends! The weather was fantastic and it was great!
122,5.0,"Namsan Park is in my backyard, so I often up here to jog or walk. It's especially nice in spring and summer."
123,4.0,"I visited Namsan Park in the evening by cable. Sightseeing from top of the Namsan is beautiful, sparkling. A lot of postcard and special souvenir for you to choose. When my friend come back in the morning on foot, she loved so much: a lot of golden and red leaf was on 2 sides of the street. If have a chance, I will come back to Namsan Park."
124,5.0,"A lovely green space after the razzamatazz of the shopping streets below. We visited early Sunday afternoon and went to the top to the tower via the cable car ( which has a well organised queuing system in place to move as many people up and down as quickly as possible). The day we visited it was a bit cloudy so we didn't  get the spectacular views but we did enjoy sitting and watching the world go by , the history information , the many places with the padlocks (some just seemed to be from people visiting - rather than symbols of enduring love ). Despite the numbers of visitors on a Sunday afternoon it also seemed peaceful under the trees. We were lucky enough to catch a great , free show of Korean culture . this included music and dance , tricks and marital arts displays. This occurs 2 or 3 times a week and worth being up there for . I think there are other display events  too such as the lighting of the beacon torches which must be spectacular.  Up at the top there were food concessions , shops , cafes , toilets and a free water fountain - which we were really pleased to see as the heat and humidity that day was very high . We didn't bother going up the tower as it was cloudy that day.   I would definitely recommend this as a place to visit for all ages and types of visitors - it had something for everyone."
125,4.0,I like coming here because of the peaceful trees and mountains and great walking trails you get to see a fantastic view of the city below!!! Nearby there's a park and good restaurants to eat when you are tired
126,3.0,Went up there at night and there were beautiful night views from the Namsam tower (paid about 5000 won if I'm not mistaken). but did not stay there for long. Nothing much to see from the tower.
127,5.0,"Namsan Park is fantastic.  If you want views, clear days are better, of course, but it's also just a great place to go for a walk amid greenery.  Real hiking is also possible.  The mountain is criss-crossed by hiking trails if you want a more rugged experience off the paved paths.  There will be moments that you feel like you're not in the middle of one of the world's largest urban conglomerations."
128,4.0,"I believe that this park is actually way more off the main track than you assume. It is at a corner away from Hoehyeon station, and as you turn to the corner to your right while walking from exit number 10, you will realize that it brings you further from Myeongdong and the main city center. However, it is good for a morning walk up the hill or mountain, and steps are provided along the way for you to take a walk or hike in the morning. The winter mornings are especially exhilarating for such strolls and walks, provided that you have a friend who can accompany you here."
129,4.0,The cable car ride can be done better by having seats and max 4 per car would be good. Put up our friendship locks and the view at Namsan tower was fantastic
130,2.0,"Nice place to go and relax while enjoying the view. The cafeteria and food court area has a great view. Everything here is about the view. I was taking my elderly father and mother thinking I could push them on a wheelchair (place was designated as disabled accessible) but it turned out to be very difficult. The ramp from the bus stop was very steep and luckily there was a jogging guy who helped me push my father to the top. To get down, I had to walk backward to ensure my dad didn't fall off the wheelchair.There was a less steep ramp. I thought it went to the cable car, but as it turned out it was only to the viewing platform! What kind of architect would design a wheelchair ramp only to the viewing platform at the base of the tower, but no easy access to get the disabled person easily there in the first place?? @#$%^&*!!"
131,4.0,"If you are afraid of heights like I am, have a bottle of soju before entering the chair lift. I didn't do it, but am curious to know if that works lol on a serious note, reaching the top of Namsan Park will blow you away. That's when you truly see how big the city of Seoul is! Good luck finding a spot to leave your mark in the love lock area, but definitely do it :) when you do walk around, look down at the buildings in the city as some have words printed on the roof of the buildings."
132,4.0,"This is a great park to escape from the city and do some hiking on some of the quieter trails.  The forest is lovely, much to my surprise, being so close to the city.   If you want you can go to the top and check out Namsan Tower."
133,5.0,you can use many gates to get into this park it is huge and walk till the lift that get you to Seoul tower to admire the stunning wiew...check first if is not foggy .
134,4.0,"We went here on our way up to the tower. Turned out you get far better pictures during the night here from the park rather than from the tower! It's also nice with few restaurants and cafe and the love lock zone is worth looking and putting your own lock in! We took up the lifts which took forever, next time going with the bus.."
135,4.0,"We took the shuttle bus to the top of the mountain which was inexpensive and simple to organise. Once up there, we were lucky to arrive at the moment a traditional band and fighting display was starting. This was fantastic entertainment for 45 minutes and for free.!"
136,5.0,"Namsan park, which is (according to the signs on the ground) the geographic centre of Seoul, is a great place to walk and get away from the traffic and noise, while also being able to enjoy great views down to the city. There are lots of trails and routes leading through the forest, as well as more direct roads that lead up to the top of Namsan, where you'll find the N Tower, and, particularly at night, fantastic views of Seoul. Namsan is to Seoul essentially, what Victoria Peak is to Hong Kong. There's even a cable car up to the top if you're too lazy to walk up there. Seoul City Tour buses also stop off up there, and a number of regular buses make the run back down as well."
137,4.0,"This is a lovely park, perfect for a stroll on a weekend with family and friends. The paths is well-maintained and signalized properly. We recommend two access points: from the Grand Hyatt - easier, or from Myeongdong, where the cable car can be found.As an alternative there are two buses going to the top.Toilettes available along the way.Once arrived to the top enjoy the views of Seoul, and the traditional shows. If wanting to enjoy even better views visit the Namsan Tower."
138,5.0,"Beautiful park...buy a one way ticket up the Seoul tower and walk down through beautiful Namsan park.  So worth it!!!  Lovely terrain, streams and much more"
139,4.0,"A long haul to visit the mountains in the city, why not visit just here at Namsan Park. I found it quite amusing as seeing the cable car rides up from the base to the peak is a totally new experience for me and my friends. The atmosphere in this region brought an intensive feeling where I felt much at home with mother nature. For a long time, I didn't feel that way. But now, through this I feel completely different."
140,5.0,"Went there about 6:00 pm took a taxi to the cable car.  Saw the breath taking view of the city, bring your lock or you can purchase a lock from a vendor there. My lock was the only American combination lock on the fence😃Warning: LOT LOTS LOTS of stairs so if you have a bad knee think about it - you know if your body- I can't remember if there was an elevator. I managed to make it, by walking SLOWLY"
141,3.0,"Sometimes it is impossible to get on top of the Namsan Tower. The wait for the Tram can be as short as one hour or as long as three. Once up there, it is worth it to see night fall."
142,4.0,"Seoul is remarkable in that about a quarter of the surface is reserved for nature.  Namsan, in the very middle of the metropolis, is a prime example.  And between the Grand Hyatt Hotel and Seoul Tower is this beautiful park that once was the location of the first 'foreigners'' apartment buildings of the early 1960s.  The apartments are now gone, replaced by excellent landscaping, perfect for a stroll, walking a dog, and getting some nice views of Seoul below.Generally speaking, this park is not in a 'must see' category, except during the cherry blossom season.  The park has some excellent cherry trees and in autumn, it is a prime place to check out the golden ginko leaves and foliage from many other trees.There are a couple of restaurants, but it is more ideal as a picnic location.  And if you are staying at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, it's a perfect place for a jog or a run.  (It is also one of the preferred run starting point of various, local Hash House Harrier clubs.)"
143,4.0,"Namsan is a hill/mountain that screams Seoul so much, it appears in many Korean dramas/movies that are set in Seoul. Go at night if you would love to experience it with a partner with all the romantic feeling of the thousands of Seoul city lights. However, prepare for the long queue for the cable car where the waiting time can be more than 2 hours.I myself prefer to go on the afternoon because there are lots of beautiful views when the sun is still up. If you do not look forward for an uphill walk or you have limited time during the autumn season, take a cable car to the foot of N-Tower and descend by walking along the beautiful trees in autumn colours. It wasn’t so tiring when you are surrounded by the beautiful view of the city under the shady trees."
144,3.0,"We were in Myeongdong on a Sunday and tried to hail a cab to the cable car station, but most cabs won't take us there. We finally had a nice cab driver who was willing to send us there, but there was a huge jam up the hill slope, and finally when we arrived at the cable car station, there was an extremely long queue waiting for the cable car. I imagine the queue would take 2 hours. We gave up and asked the cab driver to send us back to our hotel. I recommend to go during weekdays in future."
145,5.0,So far my favourite spot in Seoul despite the long journey up. Very beautiful sunset on the chilly platform. Bring locks to lock your love there to avoid getting charged more than you need for locks on platforms. To go up to the cable car go the the main road and there is a lift to the cable car platform. We took the longer way which is through the hills on curvy slopes(torturous!) Remember to ask the locals to confirm! Couples should go as it is extremely romantic :)
146,4.0,"The cable car to Namsan park is a short walk up from the Myeongdong metro station, about 10 minutes.  I would suggest going in the morning as afternoons can be busy, especially if it's a public holiday or weekend.  If you don't mind queues then go anytime.  About 8000 kW for the cable car then an entrance fee for the Seoul Tower.  Great views of Seoul from the top. Have been there both winter and spring, both good."
147,4.0,"Huge view and great way to take in the scope of Seoul which I found a little terrifying. Recommend walking up and taking the cable car down. I went in the middle of the day and it didn't take any time to get on the cable car. The walk up is surprisingly ok given how high you get, but there seems to be multiple points to join the path- I think our taxi took us to one that was halfway up already. Lots of locals head up the hill too- it seems to have a soft path which I can only assume is used by masochists who jog up the mountain."
148,5.0,My friend and I walked to the tower... It took us 2 1/2 hours! It was beautiful but it took forever. It was fun. A lot of the locals go up by walking. I would recommend catching a taxi or a bus to the top is a must for the faint of heart.
149,5.0,One of the best ways to spend a day in Seoul on a nice day is to walk the many paths up Namsan.  Not too steep  but lots of views and refreshing.
150,5.0,"Visited as part of a night  tour with seoulistic on a Saturday night. A lot of couples, buzzing with excitement.  Enjoyed the views, the time with new friends (Seoulistic), and my daughter. What makes this place is who you visit it with. Fresh, naive, innocent love, before the realities of life take hold seems to be all around.   I imagine if you visted it on your own or after a break-up, it could be very hard to soak up the ""love"" that seems to be in the air hear."
151,4.0,"I chose to walk up the park and it was nice experience. However, spent quiet some time to figure out the location.Go to the direction of cable car and there's on short distance cable car (free) to carry you to the ticket office. Go opposite to continue the walking staircase to the top. A surprise to take the walking path is there's a deck that able to take panorama view of Seoul city.On top of hill is touristy things such as love pad lock, N-tower, but don't forget some history structure of Namsan."
152,4.0,Nice park to explore for an escape from the city. The landscaping of the park is pleasant and the hill trails make the terrain interesting.
153,3.0,Went to Namsan Park but we skipped the tower as we think that was nothing much. Had to walk a little uphill to reach Namsan Park. The place where you could see so many lovelocks with names written on it. There is a gift shop at the park too. You can purchase ticket to go up to the tower but we didnt do it.
154,5.0,"Lots of trails around the mountain to get away from people, or go up to the tower and fight crowds.  Exercise stations line some of the major paths."
155,5.0,"I went here again 2 times last year. November and December, in 2 consecutive times. Last week of November, I went here with my friends. Since I already went here last 2012, It's not that exciting but still a perfect place to view Seoul in 360 degrees.After a week, I came here with my cousins. It was already winter, December 2014, First Snow day in Seoul!! Okay, At first that the snowflakes that happened in Dec 1 is the first snow but it was not. In our last day in Seoul, at 2am, we were awaken by the fact that it was really the First snow! OMG. Dream come true for us. After the sunrise that day, we decided to go to Namsan Park because we feel that we will see a very amazing view of White Seoul that morning. So we rode a bus to get there, the road to Namsan park is so beautiful, full of snow. When we already arrived in the park, it was just so amazing. Snowy white Namsan Park. OMG. I will never forget that day, the beauty that I've seen. We thank God for that chance and God is really amazing. It was really beautiful. It was our last day in Seoul, we wish we had more time to enjoy the snow (we want also to go Nami). We went here last 2012 but in autumn, so if you want to see the beauty of Namsan, maybe winter and spring will be the best time."
156,4.0,"The Park itself is magnificent although a rather tough hike. However, the views from the top - and Namsan Tower - are incredible and worth the effort. You can also skip the exercise and take a bus or cable car straight to the tower."
157,5.0,"Whenever I visit Seoul, I visit Namsan Park, almost daily for my work-out instead of hotel gym.Taxi is prohibited, but there are many ways to reach there.There are many walking tracks but I prefer path near Shilla Hotel (Dongjuk University) or path from Cable Car station (mostly steps) depends where I am staying. If you are not keen on walking, you can reach there by cable car (8,500 won return).  Often there is long queue for cable car both way.Electric circulation bus runs frequently which cost about approx. 1,000 won per ride.""Seoul City Tour Bus"" goes there as well.It's beautiful any season, day or night,  and really good work-out to walk there from nearby hotels. There are many exercise station along the way and great view point. Great view from top of the mountain even if you don't go into the top of N-Tower which cost extra 9,000 won for ride."
158,4.0,It was fun visiting the place. There are lots of options around which makes it even more fun and worth visiting. It seems that there is something for everybody that visits the place and because of which it can be easily incorporated into the itinerary and makes it a must visit place.
159,5.0,"Beautiful from the top of the mountain see city view or from the city have the Namsam view. if you have enough time, good to walk"
160,5.0,I love everything here.. clean.. good restaurants.. only in weekend was so busy so better go in week days instead..
161,4.0,A very good place to visit. You will see a better view of Seoul. You can ride the cable car or tell your driver to bring you to the drop-off point near the tower.
162,4.0,we decided to visit n seoul tower at night to see the color of the tower. we use the cable car back and fort. but i think it is best to visit during daytime where you can take the pictures of the seoul at the observatory. the place in the padlock area is dark
163,5.0,"It is really nice to go there with your honey to see on forest and city, go up and down and take beautiful photos!!!"
164,3.0,"Compared with the Peak in Hong Kong, the cable car and the view of Namsan park is not stunning. Generally, the environment is still comfortable. Not only visitors travel the park, but as well there are lots of locals to have a relaxing time.If you haven't been Hong Kong or Tower 101, it's worth to go there."
165,4.0,"Personally I don't think you can walk from Myeongdong to the cable car station but I never was a walking person anyway. The sunset view from the platform was spectacular. And thanks to those locks, the place looked more colorful and lively. We were planning to stay for the night view but it got too crowded and Seoul doesnt have many interesting high scrapers like Hong Kong, so we decided to leave."
166,5.0,"It was a little difficult to find and I must again say wear comfortable shoes as it is a lot of uphill walking involved here but when you get there it is a beautiful, peaceful and scenic visit.  This would be after the tram as this is a very hot and long wait before you finally get to the top, although you will have some amazing memories if you watch the sunset from there."
167,4.0,"Visited the park to ascend the tower and take in the wonderful view of Seoul.  We visited at dusk for the nightview, however it was very busy at this time and, due to the lit food stalls in the tower itself, it was difficult to get good photos.  I would recommend visiting the tower during the day and staying for lunch in one of the restaurants. There are 2 cable cars to get to the top, however you can walk up to the second car if you wish."
168,5.0,Very beautiful place located on forest mountain. Jogging or bicycling is very suitable. Top of the mountain there is Namsan tower which is more pretty in night times. But note that they turn off the light of the tower at 12AM so make sure you shot your photo before that. Enjoy
169,4.0,"We walked from the bottom ALL the way to the top; didn't go in the Tower, since it was late in the day and raining (therefore, no views). But still, a vigorous, enjoyable hike up. On a clear day, I imagine you could see for miles!"
170,4.0,I've been here many times and each time there is something new to see. It was my 6th trip so not too interested in going there again.
171,4.0,"It is truly a bliss for locals to have such a natural set for outdoor activities. Way up the mountain is shaded with dense tress, nice pavements and happy locals. We didn't take the cable car since walking is much better to connect to an authentic Seoul life."
172,5.0,We took the cable car up to Namsan Tower & then walked down the paths back into the urban area. It is a beautiful walk down & makes you feel like a local. It is beautifully maintained & safe & clean.
173,5.0,We didn't take the cable car but I must say that the view while climbing up the seemingly eternal stairs of the mountain was spectacular. There are benches along the way where you could take a rest. There are gym equipment along the way too. Better bring your own refreshments as they are not available until you're at the top.The park itself has no entrance fee but you have to pay to enter Namsan Tower. I like that you could have free drinks and food together when you pay the entrance fee. Lots of couples spending time together (you can find Locks of Love here) but if you're single or with friends then this place is good for having some chill time.
174,5.0,"This is a great place to go with friends, family, or loved ones. Can be a very romantic gesture for an evening stroll, or simply go to hangout with friends. Would fully recommend visiting."
175,5.0,"Namsan is an absolute must if you're visiting Seoul. The view alone is worth the trek up the mountain. I recommend taking the local Yellow Bus (I believe it's number 2) up the mountain. It's cheap and saves your calves! Once up there, let your camera do the work. There's also a great gift shop, Cold Stone, and wonderful Burger place once you get there near the tower."
176,4.0,"There are a few tourist attractions in the world that appreciates a bit of vandalism. The ""(insert your name here) was here"" and the together forever writings were everywhere.  The couple locks tree were beautiful though and the view is awesome. Only problem I had is there's no signage going to the cable car. It was hard to find."
177,5.0,"Had a lovely walk on the circular route at Namsan Park ... A easy walk which has hills but is tarmac all the way, no steps once you're on it (not sure about entrance for accessing without steps). We did the circular route which was very pretty with view points ending at the tower and then walked down (lots of steps) instead of taking the cable car as the line was long. Tower admission was W9000 for the basic up and down (other packages with food were available)Very easy and different to Bukhansan Park which is much harder Directions: Exit 2 of Meyongdong subway and then head straight up, keep left then turn right at the small supermarket. Keep going up hill and you come to a road, cross the road and up the obvious steps and you're onto the path. Turn left (away from tower) and you can walk around the whole park (Maximum 7km) ending at the tower."
178,5.0,"The observatory provided a bird's eye view of Seoul, regardless of the time of the day.A post office was available at the observatory for travellers to write and send postcards to friends and family.Love locks bridge was beautiful.Namsan cable car was a great experience. However, staff would encourage more people to get on the cable car despite the fact the cable car was already full and stuffy. This may affect the safety of passengers"
179,5.0,"The park is very worth your visit if you want to stroll around, relax and see what Seoul can really offer"
180,4.0,"Use this cableway to get on top of the hill (btw if you get there's no such need to get on top of the tower - view is practically the same, but at tower you will watch through the muddy glass). Nice place, good view 360 degrees."
181,3.0,"The elevator to the cable car station was an interesting ride.  With gradual views of the disappearing city, it is apt as a prelude to the trip to the top.  The cable car was interesting and when you reach the top, you still get to go to the top of N Seoul Tower.  The view is very good and there are plenty of places where you can rest or park yourself with some drinks to appreciate the views.  All the paths are generally well kept and easy to navigate."
182,5.0,"Do visit this place at nighttime and have an awesome view of the city. You also get to visit the N Seoul Tower, which is a must see as well."
183,4.0,"The tower has the best Seoul view.If you are lucky, you may see some historical shows on the park.Very decent place to see in Seoul."
184,5.0,"Indeed, a breath of fresh air for someone who lives from the sunny side of the world :D It was spring time-Cherry blossoms season when we visited the place and it was so beautiful... The weather was perfect. Though there were also several tourists enjoying the scenery, still the atmosphere was so peaceful and relaxing. Do visit the park just before the Sundown, surely you'll love it. ;)"
185,5.0,"This park is a trail that leads to the top of the mountain which gives you an amazing view of the city. You can walk, or take the cable car up. We took the cable car up, and walked down. It's quite a distance up so choose your battle. At the very top you can take pictures, eat great food, and enjoy some of the events they might be hosting. My friends and I arrived a tad late as the musical event was just wrapping up. The trail down hill was also refreshing with more amazing views and an interesting ""gym-like"" playground, with actual workout equipments. Highly recommend visiting this place."
186,5.0,I went for an early morning walk as the park is only about 500 metres uphill from the SungJi love motel I was staying in. I went by myself and felt entirely safe doing so. The park is well signposted and in English too and with some maps. Didn't get up as far Seoul Tower but will try that soon. Don't expect Koreans to acknowledge your Australian friendly smile though. Apparently it is a Confucian thing as they haven't been introduced to us and so don't know what our relative status is which impacts on the nature or degree of greeting.
187,4.0,"We walk and run to the tower weekly. Great views and photo's! A must do when you come to Seoul. Restaurants at the tower are a little pricey, the one convenience store sells reasonable priced necessities."
188,4.0,"I hesitated a bit for writing a review for this park, because i dont want it become super popular and too crowded. The park is located in mid-skirt of Namsan mt, you will get to see the westernpart of seoul. Cute trails, open square covered with (fake) grass. Which is still very rare in Seoul. I daydream about picnicing here and playing freesbie."
189,3.0,"We went there on our way to the Tower.  It's nice to ride the cable car and see Seoul from above.  We went there late in the afternoon and it was getting dark.  Go there during the day and enjoy the view of the park and the city.  If you have time,  I bet the walk down would also be nice and relaxing.  We were too late for the cherry blossoms but it would be extra nice if you go there at its peak."
190,4.0,I enjoyed Namsan. It's pretty but very heavily visited by tourists. Seoul Tower is there along with the cable cars. I also enjoyed the lock wall.
191,4.0,"The taxi dropped us at the foot and we were told to take the local bus as it would be a steep 'climb' up the hill. It was indeed steep but it was a very lovely and pleasant climb. Sure we were out of breath at certain sections! Spring flowers were blooming along the path. At the top of the park, we bought drinks and sat in an enclosed public 'gallery' with couches facing the view - but of course it would be your luck getting a couch. Overall, a lovely 2-3 hours visit, though it got really crowded when we left the place at slightly past noon. We took the public bus down, and regretted slightly, as it seems to be a lovely walk down with cherry blossoms petals 'raining' down on you (it was a different route from our way up)."
192,4.0,Enjoy the park in daylight but come at night for the views from the tower.  Be warned of the steep climb though-definitely not for geriatrics.
193,4.0,The walk from the base of Namsan gondola/cable car to the intersection near the Banyaon Tree hotel is only 3.5 kms but at a grand total of 7 kms will give your heart and legs a pretty good workout as you go up and down the mountain.
194,4.0,"Namsam Park is a great way to exercise, but also has great views. You will see locals walking up and down daily and also tourists everywhere. However we didn't go up the tower, it is quite a good walk."
195,4.0,"a pleasant place to stroll and even to heal the feelings within the center of city and good amenities like bathroom and lights in the night also good location near to Hyatt Hotel seoul and near to Seoul city Tower. One thing it lacks is that there is no cafeteria even for a cup of coffee, however, do not feel the other way because it heals  your feeling even at the center of city!!!!The transportation is available for regular local buses number (Blue Color 400 and yellow Color 02 at Itaewon subway station at the gate number of 4 and 3 way little for walk like few minutes but this 400 bus is cheap but not recommendable because foreigners who do not have city bus card in hand. In case, for those who need it, can approach the Itaewon subway station's foreigners office within the station in its amenities.please, bear in mind the station officer's little english if you are native speakers and for other country tourists like Spanishes or Germans or Italians"
196,5.0,"Namsan park is great for people going solo, with friends, or family. There are multiple trails, paved and dirt, Seoul tower, picnic spots with views of the city, and an overall feel of well-being. If I were closer to the park, I'd go on a regular basis. You can easily spend hours here, and should."
197,4.0,"If you visit this place,you can enjoy seeing beautiful view.And at the middle of this park,you can eat a tornade potato."
198,5.0,"Climb the mountain, exercise, walk your dog, or just sit in the park to relax. You can take a taxi or subway there, it's conveniently located around bus stop."
199,5.0,"It has beautiful road with trees and others up to the N Seoul TOWER, moreover, you could take many pretty picture here !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
200,5.0,"This park is really great.  Korea lacks spaces like this, so to have one in the middle of everything is really a treat.  There are great views of the city and lots of nice walking surfaces."
201,5.0,"Namsan Park is right below the namsan tower (Seoul N-Tower). We went by metro, but honestly it drops you off quite far from the cable car. namsan park is really nice, it's a green get-away in the middle of the gigantic Seoul. You get good views and nice walk. But the cable car fee is kind of expensive honestly...even though you get some amazing views of Seoul from up there. Cheers :)"
202,4.0,"The Namsan Park is just below the famous N Seoul Tower. To get there: We went there through the Metro, so it was quite a walk to get to the cable car to get to the park. If you want to get a good exercise you could actually take the stairs all the way to the top. Taking the cable car has a fee and it was a bit expensive for me.There's a lot of trees around the area, I would think that it would be best to visit the area during Autumn to see the beautiful colours. Since we went during winter time, it wasn't that great. But the view of the city was great. There are a few food shops there, so you could eat a snack with a view."
203,4.0,Very nice are to walk above the city and get views.  Historic village with old buildings is great to see - although was busy with Chinese tour groups when we were there
204,5.0,"I was staying at the Millennium Seoul Hilton hotel which overlooks the park so I had a view of it from my room. My co-worker and I hiked up the Mount Namsan to check it out. I took about 35 minutes to hike up to the Seoul Tower. It was amazing how the view kept expanding and the city noise kept getting more distant. The stairs are large and easy to moderate to climb. Once were got to the top, we found out that people bring a padlock with their lovers name on it. The lock it to the platform cable. There must be hundreds of thousands of locks on display. Very cool wish my wife would have been with me. Maybe next time. The descent back down was easy. Many great photo opportunities at the park."
205,4.0,"It was a cool spring's night when we hopped on bus number 5 at the Myeongdong subway station to bring us to our destination. The bus ride was a refreshing well deserved rested reprieve from all that walking (earlier in the day). There are so many ways to get to N Seoul Tower. We could also have taken the bus at Chungmuro Station or Dongguk University Station, which would have brought us to the parking lot of N Seoul Tower. The bus ride was very tourist friendly with each stop being announced over the speakers. And along the way there were interesting stops (we could try visiting the next time we go i.e. Namsan Library, Namdaemun Market , Hanok Village etc…)From the bus stop where we alighted, it was yet another (relatively short) walk up a steep slope. It was about 9pm and there were still quite a lot of people visiting the tower. The walk up the steep slope in the chilly night was a memorable experience (and good exercise!): the spring breeze blowing against you in the night, with the surroundings illuminated by the night lighting, accenting the colors of spring (which oddly reminded me of autumn somehow). Do go earlier if you want to visit the Bear Museum, we were to late for that but it was still worth the trip. I believe the view at night is prettier than the day at the tower is illuminated by different colored lights on different days. That and against the spring/autumn/winter foliage makes it even prettier!Do check out my blog for more on my experience and photos."
206,4.0,Visited this place in october. Took the cable car to get up there. If you are couple don't forget to come to this tower. There is an area called with a lot of love padlocks. There are so many locks left by lovers in seoul. It is a symbol of locking your love up on the mountain of Namsan. It's something fun to do so you can always come back in the future to see what happens to it. I didnt bother to get into the tower building as the view from the base of the tower was good enough.
207,5.0,"Having visited Seoul on several trips this was the first time we made it to Namsan park and tower. It was a beautiful day, the weather was perfect. Many colorful leaves were still on the trees and the view from the tower, incredible. We took the tram up but walked back down. I highly recommend this stop for tourists or locals."
208,3.0,"I know that the Namsan tower and park is a very tourist-ish attraction in seoul but once you go there on a weekend, expect not to enjoy anything a bit. The observatory is enclosed owing to the fact that it's the highest point in Myeongdong. Since it is enclosed, you cannot take a picture perfect shot."
209,4.0,"The view is not very spectacular. But the air is fresh, very natural and the rail-rain is very fine.I love the feeling of standing at the high, look down to the whole Seoul, coverd in tree. Very things seem to peaceful but also seem so lonely down there..."
210,1.0,"It is close to our hotel, and we took a taxi to the cable car station for 2400won. Hotel staffs recommend walking, however the hilly road seem more suitable for taxi. The round trip on cable car is 8000won. There is a very long queue waiting for the cable car which operates must slower than expected. Reaching the top, there was huge number of visitors. Paid 9000won to Observatory, which was very crowded, lack of seats and very long queue for lifts coming down. After a disappointed visit, there is also very long queue waiting for cable car down the mountain.Upon reaching back to cable car station at the bottom, taxi touts attempted to charge us 30000won back to hotel, which cost probably 2400won. We rejected his proposal and walk down back to our hotel leisurely.However the place should be very nice if the crowd is lesser and lesser waiting time for cable cars and lifts from Observatory and honest taxi drivers."
211,4.0,Went here last Winter when it was pretty cold. Barely see the top of tower cos the haze but the view of Seoul was amazing. Couple come here to write their promises on the love padlock which I found cute. I also bought some padlock even I came here with my friends. Pretty nice experience.
212,4.0,"If you're a fan of Korean drama such as Rooftop Prince (which is a personal favorite) you'd understand my earnest desire to get a photo of that last scene in the drama. Yes the one in the post card.  Since I was staying at Namsan Guest House 3 which is conveniently located at the foot of the hill where that park is. If you're not around the vicinity, you can get there by cab or subway up to the Cable car station.So I just walked up, up, up until I got to the Namsan Tower Cable Car Station... walk past that going to the park. You can ask for directions (tip younger people tend to understand English better) for the park.  A little more walking up and you'll see a Entry Post where you can get a free map of the park.  I'm lucky the ones on duty were maybe highschool/college youth so ask away.  If you're in search for a little more cardio workout, there are some structures and facilities for exercise found along the course going up to the park. I just followed the map and got there, took a lot of pictures to my heart's content and relaxed a bit to absorb the energy of nature :)"
213,3.0,"We went to the park via cable car option. The cable car was too crowded, probably since it was a weekend. I and my friends did not enjoy the attraction. However the food options were decent and it was the only saving grace for this attraction."
214,3.0,"We went to Namsan tower at night. well loved by couples as a date place. You will find here the lovelocks and the chairs built for couples to sit close together:) we did not bother to go inside the tower, as initially planned, since the view from near the cable car entrance is good enough to see Seoul."
215,4.0,"The first exercise for me @ Korea. We walk backwards up to N seoul tower , it's so wonder action that i'd like to try again."
216,4.0,"At the summit of Namsan Park is the Seoul Tower where you can catch a great view of Seoul. You can reach Seoul Tower via cable car. When we were there, it was quite foggy and thus the view was not really clear."
217,4.0,"If you want to have a nice view of Seoul while reminiscing your favorite Korean TV dramas, then it is recommended that you visit Namsan Park"
218,4.0,the view was great and the feeling that the place had.But basicly I would say people go there for the view.
219,4.0,"We were staying at a guesthouse which is just 10 mins walks away from the namsan cable car.  We bought a return cable car ticket to get to namsan tower. Please make sure that you do not lose your ticket.Anyway, the view there is simply breathtaking. I love the fact that there's a pavillion just located in front of namsan tower, kind of like a combination of ancient + modern. We paid to went up to the top of namsan tower, and wait for the sun set. But it's not that good for picture, as the window glasses are full with stains.I do suggest to stay after the sky is completely dark as the night view of Seoul is even more fascinating."
220,4.0,"Decided to beat the crowds waiting for the cable car, and took a taxi to the top. Good idea because you can save some money and skip the lines, too. Once at the top you can eat at the same restaurants that exist near the bottom, but slightly more expensive, or you can take some pictures of the SE-SW views. Both are pretty good."
221,3.0,"If you're tired over all day trip, it's perfect for you spend your time to go to Namsan Tower.. There's multiple way to get there, one of them is by cable car...The cable car is really busy on weekend, you have to queue over than half hour before you can ride the cable car, but the sightseeing will spoil our eyes on the way up. You can see Seoul from above. Soon after get off from cable car, you still need to take a stair to reach the park, but it's worthed after you get there specially in the afternoon on Spring.. The wind will take your frazzle away, as a bonus you can see beautiful Seoul landscape. For you who are hungry, dont worry, there are food stall which sell snack and and also convenient store that provide simple snack..  You can take bus on the way home, they provide complete information about the route so don't worry, you won't get lost.."
222,5.0,place is nice though its really far and the bus ride is kinda make you dizzy but its all worth it. try the zip wire when going to island.
223,5.0,"It feels great to be at this spot during sunset. A glance of Seoul and its surroundings, breathtaking view with the palaces at your sight."
224,5.0,"You have to make a Namsan trip while in Seoul. This is the Statue of Liberty of Seoul! Plenty of trails and stairs to take. The cable car ride is nice, but not a ""must do"" in my opinion. AKA Seoul Tower and the sprawling park surrounding it. On any day you will be at the UN here... every country is represented, especially in Summer."
225,5.0,"It's very nice to walk at the park. There are good roads, and also really nice paths to walk. The view is great, you can see the city all the time. For me, this was much nicer than the tower, which is in the park also."
226,5.0,"Namsan Tower located on the top hill, if you want to reach it, you can take a bus, gondola.. or you can walk.. I walk that time.. I think it's almost 1,000 stairs.. -___- But its amazing.. Specially that time was autumn.. watching different color leaves falling from the tree.. Awesome! After that you can see view of Seoul City from above.. Beautiful!"
227,5.0,"I usually skip the touristy places so you would think I would skip Namsan Park and the Seoul tower, but the both times I've been in Seoul I've gone to Namsan. Spectacular scenery through all the observation decks on the way up. Skip the expensive cable car and walk up instead. Me and my friends almost froze walking up in winter but it was a great experience. Seeing the sunset as you go higher up is magical. Highly recommended."
228,4.0,"Although it was cold and a bit foggy it was still a nice visit. Took the cable ride then walk around and took some pictures. For a K-pop, K-drama fan like me, its a place to see :) since I've seen it a few times on k-dramas."
229,3.0,"Namsan Park is where you can see the N Seoul Tower and the Locks of Love. It was really interesting to see, but I wouldn't plan an entire day at the park. There are a couple of restaurants and stores also."
230,5.0,"Well known for the Teddy Bear Museum and Boys Over Flowers set. Must-see! You can go there by bus or you can explore the area and walk your way up to the top. If you're travelling couple, make sure to bring 1 padlock and place it on one of the sections where lovers pledge their undying love. LOL make sure to throw the keys away! :))"
231,4.0,"I loved Namsan park, make sure you climb to the summit of Seoul N Tower either by cable car or braving it up on foot!"
232,4.0,"It is a good place too see in seoul especially the cable car experience to and fro, the valley view, the lovers gallery, the tower...over all a must see for visitors in seoul"
233,5.0,"Great place to have an overview of the whole city. N Seoul Tower being the icon of the city, a definite must go if you are in Seoul."
234,4.0,We went during chuseok. There were awesome sword demonstrations at the tower and tons of entertainment (mostly in korean but still good fun). The walk up from the bottom is not bad or hard! Save your money and walk it instead of the cable car. Its ₩8000 return and you have to wait in a queue. Take a lock along.
235,4.0,"nice view, but avoid weekends/evenings. loooooonnggggggg que for cable car! prefer to come early in the morning. start at 9am"
236,4.0,"We walked up the stairs to reach the top of Namsan Hill. The queue for the cable car was very long and a local told us that the walk would only take ~ 30mins. The stairs were challenging, but with a few breaks at points where the views could be enjoyed, we made it and felt a quiet sense of achievement. The view at the top is excellent with many places to enjoy a snack or complete meal. Go around dusk to enjoy the day and night view of the city. Check out the locks that represent unending love! Have fun and get fit at the same time!"
237,4.0,Breathtaking view of Seoul City at the top of the park and the tower. Good for lovers wishing to leave their mark at the park with love lockets and whatnots.
238,5.0,"A must-see! My favourite, one and only - Namsan Park and N Tower. If in Seoul, just go and see, enjoy, have fun! A place you'll never forget :)"
239,4.0,"There isn't much activity you could do there, maybe a walk in the park, picnic and for picture taking... Namsan Park is pretty much a park... is pleasant to go there during Spring season..."
240,5.0,"Hike, walk or take the stairs. Work out equipment along the way if you wish. Get out with the locals and enjoy the cool mornings in June. Caution if it has rained it can get a bit slick on the road to the top."
241,5.0,"A beautiful scenic route lined with so many flower trees and Forsythias.  I was there with 6 of my girl friends on April 18 during Spring and managed to see beautiful cherry blossom along Namsan Road. A great walk and was able to sit and relax without anyone bothering us... we reached there by Seoul city tour bus. How to get there: To get to the Namsan Trail, walk 10 to 15 minutes from Exit #3 of Myeongdong Station (Subway L-4).To get to the Namsan Cable Cars, go out of Exit #3 of Myeongdong Station (Subway Line 4) and walk approximately 10 to 15 minutes towards the Pacific Hotel.Shuttle Bus Info:Take the yellow Namsan shuttle bus from in front of Exit #2 / Daehan Theater (대한극장) atChungmuro Station (Subway Line 3, 4), or from in front of Exit #6 of Dongguk Univ.

242,4.0,A piece of peace in the city.  Koreans like to walk and clear their minds.  When in Rome...
243,5.0,"This year was my second visit to Korea, and each time, I always made sure to visit Namsan Park.  The first time was winter, 3 years ago.  This time, we went during early spring.  The climb up from the subway station, for me, is part of the experience.  And depending on which road or side street you take, walking up the steep inclines on a very chilly spring day is quite a challenge.  My friend almost gave up when we were already a few meters from the cable car station.Don't worry, there will always be buses or cabs that can take you to Namsan.  It's best to go there in the afternoon, on a weekday, if you want to avoid the crowds.  Especially if you want to take the cable car to the top of Namsan.  Weekends, especially Sundays, can be very crowded and you won't get to see much from your cable car ride if you don't manage to get a spot by the window.The reason why it's better to go in the afternoon is that you will be able to see the beauty of Namsan during the day and night.  During the day, you'll see the foliage and the city around you, while at night, the lights will dazzle you.  Don't forget the sunset, too.The first time I was here, we managed to catch a 'Royal' ceremony.There are also vending machines selling drinks in the park, and cafes and restaurants, too.  Some even offer seats closeGoing back, we decided against taking the cable car mainly because my friend realized she was scared of heights. LOL  So we walked down to the bus stop.  There are different buses that go to different areas in Seoul, including subway stations.  You may use your T-money."
244,4.0,"you can enjoy Namsan tower, nice view of the big city, some people can get a portrait, form time to time there are some event with celeb"
