0,5.0,I stayed at the Lotte Hotel which was about ten min walk from shinsegae dept store. Starting from the eighth floor it is duty free. There are a lot of luxury goods but for Hermès they don’t have bags and only comestics and stuff. It is a lovely mall! If you buy from the normal vendors the tax refund place is on the fourth floor with the sports wear stuff like adidas and Nike etc.
1,5.0,"FOOD: To those foodies out-there who are also obsessed with supermarkets, farmers-markets, fish-markets, look no longer further. Because this underground supermarket is amazing and super chic. It's like a love-child between wholefoods + harrods food hall. Clean, tidy and well-aerated in the right way being too clinical. You still get the visceral experience of food-hunting. Local organic produces from Jeju like chesnuts, mandarins, grains and veg displayed are super enticing. Fish from its peninsular so fresh and glistening. Dried fish and orange shimps vacuumed packed. The seaweed section is the piece de la resistance! How do you choose from 4 shelves of seaweed???? Dried, shredded, salted, in sheets, chiffons, unsalted... There was not enough time to check out the cooked section but I did a 360 around all the international counters. The pizza Vietnamese and sushi counters piqued my interest. Sweets section had all the delightful packaged traditional goodies like bean paste or green tea flavoured treats. Also had chocolates and icecream from international brands. Decor: Relatively high ceiling space. It was dimly lit, but the warm lighting gives the belly of this place a sort of sexy vibe. Servce: amazing Korean ladies in the vegetable and seaweed section. They don't speak English. I was communicating in sign language. Nonetheless, they were so sweet and helped me select less ripened produces when I gave her - the airplane sign.Crowd: Well-heeled locals and couples.Price: pricyVerdict: when you feel lost in translation in Seoul, you can always find solace and food in here!"
2,5.0,"If you need it you can find it at this department store.  High end products plus gifts for business associates makes this an ideal stop while in Seoul.  Need wine, pastry, chocolate, clothes, etc, you will be able to find it here.  friendly and courteous staff always!"
3,5.0,Could've christened it the 21st Century Harrods of Korea! What a superlative experience it is to spend time in this mall . . . Right from the parking attendants in their tailcoats to the concierge service inside is truly outstanding.
